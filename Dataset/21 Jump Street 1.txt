LAST YEAR THERE WERE 280 BILLION INCIDENCES OF VIOLENCE ON HIGH SCHOOL CAMPUSES IN AMERICA.
UNFORTUNATELY, THIS FILM IS BASED ENTIRELY ON TRUE EVENTS.
FORTUNATELY, VERY FEW SCHOOLS ARE LIKE VALLEY HIGH... YET.
INT. '67 CORVETTE - NIGHT
Two white guys sit in a Marlboro Maroon '67 Corvette, sporting weak moustaches. SCHMIDT, 23, awkwardly applies a fake scar to his forehead with spirit gum.
SCHMIDT
Got your backstory down?
JENKO, 23, scratches his chin in chimplike fashion.
JENKO
This is a bad idea.
SCHMIDT
Look, it couldn't be easier. At no point do we even consider resorting to "Midnight Baboon".
JENKO
Shit I hope not, considering we're off duty.
SCHMIDT
We set up the buy and ask for delivery tomorrow. They leave to make the drop, bwoop! Pull 'em over in the patrol for a broken taillight. What's this? A trunkload of high grade heroin? Freeze putos, you’re busted. We're heroes. We get fast tracked for a gold shield. Couple years later, we apply for S.I.S. and spend our career shooting bad guys in the face.
JENKO
S.I.S. would be tits.
SCHMIDT
Just observe my natural theatrical ability and follow my lead.
Jenko observes Schmidt. Schmidt just sits there. Jenko snorts, throws his car door open and heads for the house.
2.
EXT. SCARY ECHO PARK HOUSE - NIGHT
Schmidt catches up with Jenko in a driveway of a scary house.
SCHMIDT
Is this the Mexican Gangbanger
house from Training Day?
JENKO
Saying "Mexican" is racist.
SCHMIDT
What else am I supposed to call
someone from Mexico?
JENKO
Spanish American.
SCHMIDT
You're a fuckin' idiot.
JENKO
Don't call me a fuckin' idiot.
Jenko kicks the TAILLIGHT on a '69 IMPALA in the driveway.
EXT. SCARY EAST L.A. HOUSE, FRONT DOOR - NIGHT
A beautiful CHOLITA, 19, answers the door. Schmidt stammers.
SCHMIDT
Uh... hi... um... 
JENKO
Go get Domingo.
The Cholita stares at Jenko, defiant.
JENKO (CONT’D)
Now, bitch.
CHOLITA
Domingo!
Jenko winks at Schmidt.
INT. SCARY EAST L.A. HOUSE, KITCHEN - NIGHT
FIVE MEXICAN BANGERS stare across the table. JESUS CRISTO, 15, spider web tattooed across his head, Atlanta Falcons jersey with "R. MEXICO" on the back, mad dogs Schmidt.
3.
JESUS CRISTO
Ever get your shit pushed in, holmes?
SCHMIDT
Yeah. But not by a dick. Yet.
DOMINGO, 30, huge banger in an "H. SMITH" Giants jersey, nods.
DOMINGO
How much shit you need?
SCHMIDT
A shitload.
DOMINGO
What’s a shitload? 20 grams? 20 keys?
JENKO
20 grams. The more shit the better.
JESUS CRISTO
Are you fuckin' retarded?
JENKO
No!
JESUS CRISTO
20 grams is less than two kilos by
1,998 grams, stupid.
SCHMIDT
Look, we need two keys. That shit moves, we come back for more shit.
DOMINGO
I don't even know what shit you're talking about, fool.
JENKO
You know what shit. The shit shit, man. The shit.
Domingo and Jesus share a look. Domingo smiles.
DOMINGO
Shiiit.
INT. REALLY NARROW HALLWAY - NIGHT
The Gangsters flank Schmidt and Jenko as they walk a dark hallway lined with black velvet paintings of Saints.
4.
EXT. SCARY EAST L.A. HOUSE, BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS
The Gangbangers usher Schmidt and Jenko into a huge, empty backyard. They stop next to a walled-off dogfighting ring.
SCHMIDT
You guys have dogfights?
DOMINGO
Nah, holmes. This is where we have pony rides for our kids. We only keep dogs for companionship.
Jesus clicks a remote control. A GARAGE DOOR facing the yard opens, revealing 20 cages full of SNARLING PIT BULLS.
DOMINGO (CONT’D)
Aw. I think they're lonely.
INT. BACKYARD GARAGE - CONTINUOUS
The Mexican Gangbangers usher Schmidt and Jenko into the garage. The dogs growl and snap at them from behind the cages. Schmidt casually leans against a breeding stand.
DOMINGO
The dogs make love on there.
Schmidt casually pushes away from the stand. He spies a HYDRAULIC VALVE under a sign that says "NO MOLESTAR".
SCHMIDT
We were actually hoping to make the exchange in a neutral location.
JESUS CRISTO
Take off your pants, bitch.
JENKO
What dude?
DOMINGO
Gotta search you for wires.
JENKO
You think we're cops?
SCHMIDT
That's really offensive.
DOMINGO
You motherfuckers don't sell drugs.
People who sell drugs look tore up.
(MORE)
5.
DOMINGO (CONT'D)
Your face look like a shaved
teenage pussy. Real sweet.
Schmidt and Jenko notice they're standing in front of a wall covered in blood spatter.
SCHMIDT
The baboon screams at midnight.
JENKO
Shit, really?
SCHMIDT
Man, fuck yo' mama!
Schmidt PUNCHES Jenko in the stomach. Jenko doubles over.
SLOW MOTION: Jenko comes up with a GLOCK 36 in his hands.
JENKO
(slow motion warp)
LAPD MOTHERFUCKERS, DROP IT!
Schmidt DIVES for the HYDRAULIC VALVE and turns it. Twenty dog cages fly open. The PIT BULLS leap out in slow motion.
REALTIME: The Pit Bulls quickly run out of the garage.
JENKO (CONT’D)
Dude?
SCHMIDT
I thought they'd attack their
oppressors!
Domingo reaches for a gun in his waistband and SHOOTS himself in the leg. Everyone stares at the smoking bullet hole.
DOMINGO
I shot my leg. I shot my leg.
Jenko and Schmidt RUN. The other Bangers pull their guns.
INT. REALLY NARROW HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
Bullets splinter the doorway as Jenko and Schmidt dive into the house and sprint down the hallway.
6.
EXT. SCARY EAST L.A. HOUSE, STREET - CONTINUOUS
Schmidt and Jenko run out the front door and are immediately chased by six Pit Bulls. Schmidt throws his gun at a dog. They barely make it into the Corvette, slamming doors.
INT. ‘67 CORVETTE - CONTINUOUS
Jenko FLOORS it, burning rubber. Pit Bulls leap and snap at the windows. Schmidt screams into a police radio.
SCHMIDT
Officers under fire and dog attack!
INT. THE RIGHT FIELDER - NIGHT
“Pancho and Lefty” plays on the juke. Schmidt and Jenko sit at the bar in “The Right Fielder”, in mild shock.
JENKO
We almost died.
SCHMIDT
Makes you think about everything
you never accomplished in life.
JENKO
Makes me want to get drunk. Hey man, two doubles of Wild Turkey.
A burly BARTENDER nods at Schmidt.
BARTENDER
I need your I.D.
SCHMIDT
I’m a cop.
BARTENDER
Sure you are.
SCHMIDT
I don’t have I.D., we were undercover.
BARTENDER
Sure you were.
The Bartender goes to grab the bottle.
JENKO
Sarge was pissed. Can’t believe
he’s sending us to Dep Chief.
7.
SCHMIDT
We’re definitely getting fired. I’d shoot myself in the head if I didn’t throw my gun at a dog.
The Bartender puts two shots on the bar. Jenko downs one.
Schmidt reaches for the other, but Jenko downs it too.
The door opens. Five MANLY COPS enter and head for the pool table. WEXLER, 28, very big ears, winks at Schmidt and Jenko.
WEXLER
What up, faggots.
JENKO
What up, Rampart assholes.
WEXLER
Hey Jenko, remember that time your
Dad got shot by a clown?
FLASH CUT: A mustachioed cop gets gunned down by a clown.
Jenko steps off the stool. Schmidt holds him back.
SCHMIDT
We got enough trouble.
JENKO
He wasn’t dumb. He got ambushed.
SCHMIDT
I know, man. I know.
At the other end of the bar, Schmidt sees an attractive woman make out with a gray haired man in a conservative suit.
SCHMIDT (CONT’D)
Dude. Is that your girlfriend?
JENKO
Ha ha.
SCHMIDT
Dude, seriously. That’s Regan.
Jenko double takes. He walks over and stands behind the couple. REGAN, 26, looks up, startled.
REGAN
Oh... shit. I didn’t want you to
find out this way.
8.
JENKO
I come in here all the time, so I’m pretty sure you did.
The older gentleman excuses himself to give them space.
JENKO (CONT’D)
You’re cheating on me with your Dad?
REGAN
I’m not 18 anymore. Sex with you is great, but I’m ready to have kids.
JENKO
So am I. I told you that.
REGAN
I know, and that’s sweet. But no offense? I don’t want to have half-retarded babies. Ron’s a detective and he’s really smart. Sometimes in life you have to make hard choices, and his dick isn’t that much smaller than yours. So... 
Schmidt crosses behind Jenko and Regan to a group of FEMALE COPS hanging by the jukebox. He drops a coin and nods to SHEILA, 24, the prettiest one there. He browses the juke.
SCHMIDT
Lookin’ for some hardcore shit. I’m gonna get seriously messed up this weekend. You got any plans, Sheila?
ABBA, “Take A Chance On Me” blasts from the jukebox.
SCHMIDT (CONT’D)
Okay, that was not my-
MOLINA, 40, the butchest female cop, towers over Schmidt.
MOLINA
Back off, bitch.
Schmidt backs off and bumps into Wexler’s pool cue, ruining his shot. Rampart cops surround him.
WEXLER
Nice moustache.
SCHMIDT
Thanks.
9.
WEXLER
I was joking.
SCHMIDT
Sorry, I forgot your ears get big
when you’re being sarcastic.
WEXLER
Don’t you think you and your butt
buddy might be better off in the
West Hollywood division?
SCHMIDT
Ha ha, because we’re gay. Hey, did you guys hit your monthly quota of shooting unarmed black guys?
Wexler shoves Schmidt. He trips on a stool and falls. Jenko steps over him and walks up to Sheila at the jukebox.
JENKO
Wanna go fuck in my car?
SHEILA
Yeah, whatever.
Schmidt watches them exit, then turns to the Bartender.
SCHMIDT
You have to give me some alcohol.
BARTENDER
Absolutely not.
Schmidt stews as a siren begins to wail.
INT. SAUSALITO ARMS, SCHMIDT’S BEDROOM - DAWN
Schmidt’s hand slams his novelty police siren alarm clock.
INT. SAUSALITO ARMS, KITCHEN - DAWN
DING! Jenko pops the microwave open. Schmidt removes Hot Pockets with a shark oven mitt and puts them on paper plates. They take a bite, make disgusted faces, and exchange Pockets.
EXT. SAUSALITO ARMS - DAWN
Schmidt and Jenko exit THE SAUSALITO ARMS, a shitty Van Nuys apartment. A MEXICAN KID IN A DIAPER flips them off.
10.
INT. DEPUTY CHIEF HARDY'S OFFICE - NIGHT
DEPUTY CHIEF HARDY (58), soft spoken, sits behind his desk.
Jenko and Schmidt, in patrol uniforms, sit across from him.
JENKO
Sir, we signed up to take bad guys off the street with a show of appropriate force. We've been cops for four years and all we ever get are creampuff assignments. Cat in a tree, or some kid's bike got stolen.
HARDY
You don't get called in on hotshots because you look twelve years old. Criminals don't respect you.
SCHMIDT
Sir, last night we had five bangers convinced we were big time dealers.
Hardy reads Schmidt's "INCIDENT REPORT" aloud.
HARDY
"At which point suspect said: ‘You motherfuckers don't sell drugs. People who sell drugs look tore up. Your face look like a shaved teenage pussy. Real sweet.’"
The guys sink in their chairs. Hardy stands. He's very tall.
HARDY (CONT’D)
Officers need to create fear on
sight. Looking at you right now, all
I see are a couple kids dressed up
as cops on Halloween. In fact... 
Hardy tosses Schmidt and Jenko a couple little Snickers bars.
Jenko starts to unwrap his. Schmidt shoots him a look.
HARDY (CONT’D)
Normally after a night where two of my officers set free 20 pissed-off pitbulls who went on to terrorize a taco truck for hours because the woman inside didn't have a cell phone, so she just had to scream "Ayudo me!" till someone heard her? Normally I’d terminate those officers. Or put them on a permanent desk.
Hardy sighs.
11.
HARDY (CONT’D)
However, I have a unit in dire need of two young white males. You got boy faces, but you showed man sized balls walking into that house. That buys you this opportunity. Don’t blow it. You report at 0600.
SCHMIDT
Where to, sir?
HARDY
Down on Jump Street. 21 Jump Street.
A church organ. “21 JUMP STREET” sprays across a bad graphic of a brick wall. The image shatters, and the ORIGINAL JUMP STREET THEME SONG KICKS IN for the OPENING CREDITS SEQUENCE:
-	Jenko and Schmidt windsurf, dragging hands in the water.
-	Schmidt steps to a HARLEY METH DEALER and BITCH SLAPS him.
-	Jenko and Schmidt dive out of an airplane shooting M-4 Bushmasters at SKYDIVING BAD GUYS. A surface-to-air missile streaks past them and EXPLODES the airplane they leapt from.
-	Jenko and Schmidt play two player “NARC” in a donut shop.
-	Jenko jumps a BMX over a slant nose Porsche 911 Targa, dropping a lit stick of dynamite into the car.
DRUG DEALER
Fuck you, asshole!
The Porsche explodes.
-	Schmidt kicks Eddie Vedder in the balls.
-	Jenko pilots a Sea Doo while Schmidt fires a belt fed M-60 at a Drug Dealer on a jet ski, annihilating him.
-	Jenko drives his Corvette on two wheels.
SCHMIDT
Wake up, we’re here.
Schmidt grabs the wheel and flips the Corvette over six times. They crawl out of the wreckage, unharmed.
JENKO
What's your problem, man?
The '67 Stingray explodes behind them.
12.
INT. '67 STINGRAY - MORNING
Jenko wakes up, drooling on the window. He looks at Schmidt.
JENKO
I let you drive?
SCHMIDT
We both agreed you were still drunk.
Jenko empties the crumbs of a Gigantor bag of COOL RANCH DORITOS into his mouth, then licks the inside of the bag. Schmidt snatches the bag and throws it out the window.
JENKO
Pardon me for having post traumatic stress disorder, dick.
Schmidt and Jenko head towards a DECREPIT CHAPEL in an alley.
INT. JUMP STREET CHAPEL - MORNING
Schmidt and Jenko enter THE JUMP STREET CHAPEL. Vibrant pop cultural artifacts blend with dusty religious iconography. Instead of pews, rows of DESKS face the pulpit.
SCHMIDT
Feels like the first day of school.
HARRY TRUMAN JR (Asian) and JACKSON FUGAZY (white), two short guys in baggy jeans and tees, eyeball Schmidt and Jenko.
SCHMIDT (CONT’D)
We need to check in with a C.O.
HARRY TRUMAN JR.
Sergeant Flynn, under the big desk.
JACKSON
You got something on your lip.
Schmidt touches his moustache. Jenko looks around, frowns.
JENKO
This must the unit that goes
undercover in high schools.
JACKSON
You must be the guy they sent over to point out really obvious shit.
Jenko takes a step towards Fugazy. Schmidt pulls him back.
13.
JENKO
Another pussy assignment.
SCHMIDT
At least we won’t get shot at by a bunch of Spanish Americans.
They walk to the BIG DESK on the pulpit, hoist themselves up and find two white legs sticking out from underneath.
SCHMIDT (CONT’D)
Reporting for duty sir!
The man startles awake and BANGS his head under the desk.
GRADY (O.S.)
COCK SUCKING CHRIST!
GRADY FLYNN (37) stands into frame beneath a giant crucifix.
Blood streams down his face from his forehead.	He pulls his
Battlestar Galactica nightshirt down and squints.
GRADY (CONT’D)
My bitch wife and crazy daughters are teaming up to give me one long, slow heart attack. This is the only time of the day I get any sleep. And you just made me slam my head on a rusty nail. Thanks, asshole.
SCHMIDT
Sorry sir, just looking for a
senior officer.
GRADY
How exactly old do you think I am?
JENKO
Forty.
GRADY
FUCK YOU. I'm 33. Ascend your ass up the stairs and see Captain Dicks in the rectory. He's chill, don't bother standing at attention. That kind of formal shit just pisses him off.
Jenko and Schmidt nod.
INT. JUMP STREET RECTORY - MORNING
CAPTAIN JOHN HENRY DICKS, 40, yells at the top of his lungs.
14.
CAPTAIN DICKS
Motherfuckers, stand at attention
when I'm talking to you! You crazy?
I will shit on your face! This the
Church of Dicks motherfuckers, and I
will put mine in you, you pull any
cowboy bullshit in my unit.
SCHMIDT
Sir I assure you we have no intention of pulling any cowboy bullsh-
CAPTAIN DICKS
I WILL SHIT. ON. YOUR FACE. YOU
THINK I'M PLAYING? SIT DOWN!
Schmidt and Jenko sit down. Dicks takes a deep breath.
CAPTAIN DICKS (CONT’D) Sorry. I hate acting like Angry Black Captain. It’s a messed up stereotype. I'm embarrassed. Welcome to Jump Street. We go undercover in high schools to take down anyone endangering children. I don't like when children get endangered.
Dicks pulls down a CHART captioned “SOCIAL ILLS”.
CAPTAIN DICKS (CONT’D) Lot of problems in the LAUSD. Alcoholism. AIDS. Rape. Graffiti. Teachers try’na get in they students’ booties. But of all the evil my officers encounter out there? It’s drugs fucks kids up the most. Drugs rob a young man of his soul. Drugs extinguish a young woman’s dignity. Okay, some cats can handle they shit. But those who can’t? Are fucked. For life. Think you can get down with helping me do something about that?
SCHMIDT/JENKO
Yes sir.
CAPTAIN DICKS
Need you two to go undercover at the most dangerous school in the city and infiltrate a narcotics ring.
SCHMIDT
Which school?
15.
CAPTAIN DICKS
Valley High.
JENKO
Valley High?
CAPTAIN DICKS
YOU GOT A EAR INFUNCTION MOTHERFUCKER?
SCHMIDT
Isn't V.H.S. in a nice neighborhood?
CAPTAIN DICKS
Nice neighborhood with a lot of rich kids. One of whom just died from an overdose of a new drug called H.F.S.
SCHMIDT
What's “H.F.S”?
INT. JUMP STREET CHAPEL - DAY
LUCY (24), Latina cop, sits next to Jackson and Harry as they update fake Twitter and Facebook profiles.
LUCY
“Holy Fuckin' Shit” is a designer
drug specific to Valley High.
HARRY TRUMAN JR.
All we know is that it’s extremely expensive, extremely addictive and it comes in small doses to keep users coming back for more.
LUCY
It appears to be sold in packs of ten little wafers. We’ve never recovered a dose because users eat them all immediately. From what we’ve gathered on the net, it’s a short, intense rush with a little something for everyone.
JACKSON FUGAZY
For the Birkenstock assholes, it starts with a marijuana-like high, followed by some intense visuals. The tweakers who prefer Charlie McWhitesniff get a meth-like rush to finish things off.
16.
SCHMIDT
Side effects?
LUCY
Extreme talkativeness and explosive diarrhea.
HARRY TRUMAN JR.
Jocks play on it. Nerds study on
it. Kids from every race are using.
White, Black, Latino, Asian, Other.
JACKSON FUGAZY
Apparently the kid who died ate a
hundred doses with a value of a
thousand dollars. We don’t stop it,
more Valley kids will wind up in
the meat wagon on Prom night.
SCHMIDT
Why Prom night?
JACKSON FUGAZY
Because that’s obviously when kids
party the hardest? I know I did.
HARRY TRUMAN JR.
God I got so fucked up at Prom.
JENKO
I think I got fucked up, but I can’t remember because I was so fucked up.
LUCY
I got fucked up and fucked hard.
Everyone laughs and looks at Schmidt for his story.
SCHMIDT
So... what do we know about the kid who died?
INT. JUMP STREET RECTORY - DAY
Captain Dicks slides a POLICE REPORT to Jenko and Schmidt.
They open it to find a SCHOOL PHOTO of a smiling young man.
CAPTAIN DICKS
Billiam Williams. Star of the
Valley High Theater Department.
Found dead in the boys locker room.
17.
JENKO
His name was "Billiam"?
CAPTAIN DICKS
Yeah.
JENKO
That's messed up.
CAPTAIN DICKS
I know. I’m putting you in classes with Billiam’s friends. Hopefully they can lead you to who he bought the drug from. Anything you can find out about H.F.S, I need to know it and I need to know it now.
Dicks slides another file over. Schmidt flips through photos of MOLLY TRACEY, green-eyed brunette with librarian glasses.
CAPTAIN DICKS (CONT’D) Billiam was best friends with a "Molly Tracey". They were about to co-star in the school play. Who wants to join Play Production?
SCHMIDT
I can definitely handle that part
of the mission, sir. I trained as
an actor in Junior High.
CAPTAIN DICKS
Can you handle high school drama?
SCHMIDT
I’m very talented.
CAPTAIN DICKS
Pump her for info. And by “pump her,”
I do not mean with your johnson.
JENKO
You don’t have to worry about that, sir. This guy couldn’t get laid in a Chinese horsehouse.
Dicks slides Jenko a file with photos of NERDS.
CAPTAIN DICKS
Science Rodeo Club. Billiam was a
key member. Join it.
JENKO
Science Rodeo?
18.
CAPTAIN DICKS
Two groups of highly gifted kids competing with complex experiments.
JENKO
I’m on that like stink on rice.
CAPTAIN DICKS
It’s crucial that you identify the group selling H.F.S. Once you figure out who it is, drop all other activities and infiltrate them.
Dicks slides over two blank dossiers.
CAPTAIN DICKS (CONT’D)
Write up your undercover identities.
INT. JUMP STREET CHAPEL, LUNCH TABLE - AFTERNOON
Grady flips through Schmidt's dossier. He has written on every inch of available space, including the margins.
GRADY
Jesus pissing Christ, Schmidt.
SCHMIDT
I believe in backstory.
GRADY
Based on all your previously
successful undercover work?
SCHMIDT
Based on the fact that I trained as an actor in Junior High.
GRADY
You trained as an actor?
Schmidt nods.
GRADY (CONT’D)
What a fag. How about you, jackoff?
Grady looks at Jenko's dossier, blank except for one word.
GRADY (CONT’D)
You misspelled "whatever".
JENKO
Whatever.
19.
Grady hurls their dossiers in the trash.
GRADY
Since you geniuses obviously suck dick at coming up with identities, lemme break it down. You are the McQuaid brothers. The most violent sons of bitches ever to go to school in Northern California. You've been kicked out of six schools for infractions ranging from extreme profanity to attempted murder.
JENKO
Why aren't we in jail?
GRADY
Because you’re bad ass. So act like it. Bad ass from day one is your only way to get in with the bad guys before schoool's out! For the summer!
INT. TOPANGA MALL - DAY
Grady (Scorpions t-shirt) stands inside a MASSIVE MALL.
GRADY
Pop Quiz. Let’s see what your game is like with high school students. Doug, you’re supposed to get tight with some theater bitch, so hit up some quirky whores in the the Apple store and get me phone numbers for proof. Brad, you’re supposed to be in some Science Rodeo bullshit, go find some nerdy bitches in B.Dalton books and get me some phone numbers.
A clean shaven Schmidt and Jenko nod and deploy.
INT. THE APPLE STORE - DAY
Schmidt stares at a CARRIE, a teen girl checking out iPods.
SCHMIDT
That’s basically an iPhone without the phone. It’s pretty sick. It has wireless and you can totally download songs and browse the web.
CARRIE
Do you work here or something?
20.
SCHMIDT
No.
CARRIE
Can you leave me alone then?
SCHMIDT
No.
Carrie’s suspicious MOM approaches.
CARRIE’S MOM
May I ask why you’re talking to my daughter?
SCHMIDT
No.
Carrie’s Mom drags her away.
INT. TOPANGA MALL - DAY
Jenko hustles out of BORDERS, pursued by a SECURITY GUARD.
INT. HOT DOG ON A STICK - DAY
Schmidt chuckles in line behind two SNOTTY TEEN GIRLS.
SCHMIDT
I know, my mom is such a dick too.
TEEN GIRL IN LINE
This is a private conversation?
SCHMIDT
Why do you have to be such a bitch?
TEEN GIRL IN LINE
Why do you have to be so ugly?
INT. MERRY GO ROUND - DAY
Schmidt and Jenko sit on horses next to each other on the Merry Go Round, rising up and down, up and down.
SCHMIDT
I need your extra numbers.
JENKO
Didn’t get any. Apparently intelligent girls are scared of me.
21.
The guys stare into the middle distance... 
CAPTAIN DICKS (O.S.)
10 COMMANDMENTS OF JUMP STREET, GO.
INT. JUMP STREET RECTORY - EVENING
Schmidt and Jenko stand at attention.
SCHMIDT
ONE. Never blow your cover.
JENKO
TWO. Know your backstories.
SCHMIDT
THREE. Don't get emotionally
involved with students.
JENKO
FOUR. Don't go to parties, you
might be pressured to do drugs.
SCHMIDT
FIVE. Don't do drugs. Have a list of excuses ready for why you can't.
JENKO
SIX. Don't carry a gun on campus.
SCHMIDT
SEVEN. Don't be good or bad
students. Be average.
JENKO
EIGHT. Don’t wear a watch. Kids
don’t wear watches, police do!
SCHMIDT
NINE. Avoid violent altercations.
CAPTAIN DICKS nods, framed by a stained glass window.
CAPTAIN DICKS
And the Tenth Commandment?
Jenko and Schmidt can't remember. GRADY chimes in.
GRADY
“Never blow your cover”, dickwads.
JENKO
That's the first Commandment.
22.
CAPTAIN DICKS
It's the first and last Commandment. Just because it’s high school doesn’t mean you won’t catch a bad one if 4 Pounda’s start losin’ weight. Dig?
SCHMIDT/JENKO
(huh?)
Yes sir.
CAPTAIN DICKS
I need to know who makes this shit and I need to know it now, before it spreads to other schools. Find out who’s selling. Infiltrate the organization. Identify the supplier. Uncover this evil motherfucker’s identity so I can put the LAPD’s big black dick up his ass.
SCHMIDT/JENKO
Yes sir!
INT. THE SAUSALITO ARMS, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Jenko watches “Miami Vice” on Blu-ray. Schmidt thumbs through AN ACTOR PREPARES side by side with his old YEARBOOK.
SCHMIDT
Stanislavski says “to reproduce
feelings you must be able to identify
them from personal experience.”
JENKO
Who the fuck is Stanislavski?
SCHMIDT
The greatest drama teacher in history.
Jenko snaps off two armpit farts.
SCHMIDT (CONT’D)
We need to use what we really felt in school to help our character work. For example, what motivated you to take a shit on Principal Carmen’s desk?
JENKO
That’s what she gets for suspending me for fighting in self-defense.
23.
SCHMIDT
You started that fight. You kicked
Jason Rutmanis in the head.
JENKO
That’s what he gets for calling me a fuckin’ idiot.
SCHMIDT
See, that’s good. You should use the anger you felt over being dumb.
JENKO
(angry)
I didn’t say I was angry.
Jenko grabs the Yearbook and flips some pages, landing on a PHOTO of a girl playing volleyball: "MELISSA WHISPIT". Her face has been carefully inked out with a ballpoint pen.
JENKO (CONT’D)
You know what you should use? The fact that you never learned to party and wasted four years of your life on a bitch who wouldn’t even make out with you.
SCHMIDT
Don't call her a bitch. She was a
good person.
Jenko laughs. Schmidt eyeballs him.
SCHMIDT (CONT’D)
Just tell me now and get it over with. Did you put your dick in her?
Schmidt and Jenko share a long staredown.
JENKO
This it the last time I’m gonna say this. I did not fuck Melissa Whispit. Stop accusing me of being a bad friend just because I got shit-tanked for four years straight and had a great time.
Schmidt sighs.
SCHMIDT
I definitely should’ve partied more.
JENKO
You should’ve come to Prom. We raged.
24.
SCHMIDT
Dude, do you have even one regret
from High School?
JENKO
Yeah. Just one.
(beat)
Learning. I regret not learning.
Schmidt nods, somber. Jenko breaks into forced laughter.
JENKO (CONT’D)
You vagina, you believed me?
Jenko turns another Yearbook page:
JENKO (CONT’D)
Fuck it, man. This is what it was
all about at the end of the day.
PHOTO: TEEN JENKO pretends to choke TEEN SCHMIDT. The caption reads "MOST LIKELY TO GET MARRIED", but "GET MARRIED" has been replaced with "KICK ASS!!!"
JENKO (CONT’D)
You and me, kicking much ass.
Schmidt slams the Yearbook shut.
SCHMIDT
That’s not enough. Doug McQuaid suffered unbelievable rejection and pain as a kid. He laughs it off, but inside he’s really pissed off about it. That’s what drives him to commit acts of unspeakable violence. I don’t know how to get into that state of rage.
Jenko shrugs. He re-opens the Yearbook and reads a signature.
JENKO
Dude, your Mom signed your yearbook?
Schmidt stands up like a shot.
SCHMIDT
Oh my God. I have to move in with
my parents.
JENKO
What a horrible idea.
25.
SCHMIDT
If Daniel Day-Lewis can cobble shoes,
I can move in with my parents.
JENKO
I just got dumped, man. Don’t leave me solo at the Sausalito.
SCHMIDT
I gotta pack.
Schmidt exits the living room.
EXT. WOODLAND HILLS SUBURBAN HOUSE - NIGHT
Schmidt stands in front of a home in Woodland Hills with the identical expression he had outside the Training Day house.
INT. THE SCHMIDT HOME - CONTINUOUS
Schmidt enters. The alarm goes off. He keys the code. A huge HANDBAG smashes into the side of his head and he goes down.
ANNIE
DAVID THERE’S AN INTRUDER!
SCHMIDT
Mom, it’s me! Jesus fucking Christ!
ANNIE, 50, loud and frenzied, hits Schmidt in the head again.
ANNIE
I’m not having that kind of
language in this house!
DAVID, 55, beaten down from years of abuse, walks into the foyer. Annie hits him with her bag.
ANNIE (CONT’D)
What if this had been a sexual intruder? He’d be raping me by now!
DAVID
Now, honey, I told you that Schmidt was moving home for a-
ANNIE
Oh you most certainly did not,
unless you said it in that little
gay mouse voice you like to use.
Annie’s scowl suddenly turns into a huge smile.
26.
ANNIE (CONT’D)
My Schmiddy is moving home?
Annie grabs Schmidt and squeezes the life out of him.
ANNIE (CONT’D)
My Schmiddy is moving home!
Schmidt and David share a look. David shrugs and walks away.
INT. SAUSALITO ARMS, BATHROOM - MORNING
THE KINKS, “Schooldays”: hands wearing multiple skull rings lace up Chuck Taylors. A vintage Bones Brigade T-shirt pulls over messy hair. JENKO mad dogs the mirror.
INT. THE SCHMIDT HOME, BATHROOM - MORNING
A satin RAIDERS jacket slides over shoulders. SCHMIDT doffs a straight brim Raiders cap and mad dogs the mirror.
SPLIT SCREEN - Jenko and Schmidt give themselves hard looks.
JENKO
I’m Brad. Mess with me, I’ll punch your face so hard your nose will come out your ass. Also, I'm hella smart, which is how I make so much damn money selling drugs.
Jenko shuffles two 20's and throws them at the mirror.
Schmidt grabs his crotch.
SCHMIDT
I’m Doug. I love drinking beer and
fucking bitches. I've had sex with
twenty sluts and I'm only 18. What?
ANNIE (O.S.)
Schmiddy, hand me the box of
maxipads under the sink. Quickly.
Schmidt takes a very deep breath. Jenko slowly reaches for the 20’s and pockets them.
EXT. VALLEY HIGH PARKING LOT - MORNING
The Corvette JUMPS the curb and skids to a stop in the DEAN’S parking space. Jenko and Schmidt exit. Schmidt runs his hand over a new Porsche parked in the PRINCIPAL spot.
27.
SCHMIDT
What kind of Principal makes enough money to buy a Porsche Carrera?
JENKO
The suspicious kind.
Schmidt and Jenko walk towards campus. A TEACHER with a bloody nose runs to his Toyota Celica and speeds away.
They continue past SHEA, a young Black man in wifebeater and khakis who rubs his knuckles and glares at Schmidt and Jenko.
They continue between PICH and BORIS, a lanky Cambodian "kid" and an intense Armenian "kid", both in wifebeaters and khakis.
SCHMIDT
Sup dawgs.
Boris flicks a cigarette butt at Schmidt’s feet. Pich blows a smoke ring from a fat blunt. Schmidt and Jenko move on. They pause under a heavily vandalized BULLSHARK statue.
JENKO
I sense a breakdown in authority.
SCHMIDT
Muthafuckas be wilding out.
SALVADOR, diesel built Latino "kid", brutally SHOVES a small kid out of his way and settles at the school entrance next to CALVIN, a massive white “kid” in wifebeater and khakis. They mad dog Schmidt and Jenko as the bell rings.
JENKO
Pretty clear what needs to be done.
Jenko takes off towards a 300 pound nerd sitting on a planter, wrapping up a fierce round of "Magic: The Gathering".
BRYAN
I don't see how you guys can ever survive the power of my Necropotence.
Jenko SHOVES Bryan into the planter.
JENKO
'The hell you looking at?
BRYAN
Nothing! Nothing!
JENKO
You calling me "nothing"?!
28.
Jenko PUNCHES Bryan in the stomach, sending him to the ground. Bryan writhes around, wheezing. Students run over.
BRYAN
I can’t breathhhe.
BRYAN'S DORK FRIEND
You jerk! He has asthma really bad!
Schmidt wrestles Jenko away. A WHISTLE BLOWS and they are tackled by DEAN STANTON, 40, ex-military, a lone man struggling to keep order in the midst of anarchy.
DEAN STANTON
You wanna get rough, punks?!
Dean Stanton hustles them into school past Calvin.
INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - DAY
Dean Stanton shoves Jenko and Schmidt into a plush office.
DEAN STANTON
They parked in my spot, and tough
guy in the bandana punched a kid.
PRINCIPAL WHITEMAN, 45, creepy smile, nods at Dean Stanton.
PRINCIPAL WHITEMAN
I’ll take it from here.
DEAN STANTON
But-
PRINCIPAL WHITEMAN
Thank you, Dean Stanton.
Stanton reluctantly exits. Whiteman smiles.
PRINCIPAL WHITEMAN (CONT’D) The McQuaid brothers I presume. Which one of you is "Brad"?
Incredibly long beat. Schmidt slowly looks at Jenko.
JENKO
I am.
PRINCIPAL WHITEMAN
Detention.
JENKO
Bitchin’.
29.
PRINCIPAL WHITEMAN
Doug, would you also like detention?
SCHMIDT
No sir.
PRINCIPAL WHITEMAN
Then don’t ever put your greasy,
working class hands on my Porsche
again. Get out.
Schmidt and Jenko exit.
EXT. VALLEY HIGH, ADMINISTRATIVE HALLWAY - DAY
Schmidt and Jenko walk down the empty hallway.
SCHMIDT
Remember how you wrote test answers on your hand? Maybe you should do that with your name, Brad.
JENKO
If you know so much about acting, maybe you should stop acting like a giant pussy, Doug. “No sir, please don’t give me detention, wah, wah.”
SCHMIDT
I didn’t want to get in trouble.
JENKO
Were here to get in trouble.
VOICE (O.S.)
Hey there new guys!
Schmidt and Jenko stop in front of a table with a blue banner that reads D.A.D. WALT, 40, extremely nice, mans the table.
WALT
My name is Walt, let me be the
first to give you a big ole
Bullshark welcome... GO SHARKS!
Walt makes a shark jaw with his arms.
SCHMIDT
What does “D.A.D.” stand for, Dumb
Ass Dicksucker?
30.
WALT
Ha ha, no, it stands for “Drugs Are Dangerous!” I know you’re just “talking smack” because it’s cool, but you’ll find me here every Friday if you ever need any advice.
Walt presses some PAMPHLETS into Schmidt's hand.
WALT (CONT’D)
Maybe on the way to class, you'd
like to read about the dangerous
effects of illegal drugs!
SCHMIDT
Maybe you'd like to eat the corn
out of my shit.
Schmidt throws the pamphlets. Jenko knocks the stack of bumper stickers off the table.
INT. HEALTH CLASS - DAY
Schmidt and Jenko enter a room cluttered with models of reproductive organs. They sit down. Notebooks are covered with defaced D.A.D. stickers. A sex-ed tape plays.
JEFF BRIDGES (V.O.)
Symptoms of syphilis include paralysis, numbness, blindness, loss of memory and... um... death.
The television displays a penis covered in bloody lesions.
JEFF BRIDGES (V.O.) (CONT’D) The surest way to avoid syphilis is to abstain from sexual contact.
SCHMIDT
Fuck that!
Everyone laughs.
JEFF BRIDGES (V.O.)
The second best way to is to be in a long-term monogamous relationship with a partner who has been tested and is known to be uninfected.
JENKO
Fuck that!
Total silence. Schmidt turns to a girl sitting next to him.
31.
SCHMIDT
Hey, where can I score some H.F.S?
The girl points out a strung out boy sitting behind them.
GIRL
Ask Evan.
Evan falls out of his chair and has a seizure.
MRS. POON
Not again.
Jenko notices a WRAPPER on the ground next to Evan. He covers it with his foot and slides it over. JEREMY and PIZ, two teen burnouts, nudge Schmidt from behind.
PIZ
Bro, if you wanna get some shit you gotta go to detention.
JEREMY
Gotta get in trouble or they won’t sell it to you. Keeps the narcs out.
EXT. THE QUAD - MORNING
Jenko and Schmidt sit in THE QUAD, a grassy area surrounded by CLASSROOM BUILDINGS, THE GYM and the CANDACE CAMERON AUDITORIUM. Jenko unpeels a Fruit Roll Up.
SCHMIDT
Can I have half of that?
Jenko stuffs the whole thing in his mouth, digs in his pocket.
JENKO
Check it out.
Jenko produces the WRAPPER: a colorful H.F.S. logo with a big yellow happy face saying “Bet you can’t eat just one of them shits!” A small WAFER falls into Jenko’s palm.
JENKO (CONT’D)
One dose. We give it to lab, they
trace what it’s made of, we track
down who’s buying the supplies.
SCHMIDT
Downtown has triple homicide DNA tests backed up from five years ago, good luck with that.
32.
A group of kids walk past in a slow processional, carrying a huge photo of BILLIAM WILLIAMS. One plays an acoustic version of Pennywise, “Bro Hymn”. They sing in beautiful harmony.
JENKO
I smell Thespians.
The girl leading the procession wears a Day of the Dead skeleton mask. The group sits in a circle on the lawn. She pulls off her mask, revealing MOLLY TRACEY, 18. Schmidt gulps.
JENKO (CONT’D)
Whoa. She looks just like Melissa.
SCHMIDT
You stay away from her.
ZACK CORNELIUS, 15, a sketchy kid drinking a 24oz Red Bull, accidentally bumps into Schmidt as he approaches a group of ABERCROMBIE AND FITCH SOPHOMORES. He gives a rapidfire pitch.
ZACK
What up what up. Case you hadn’t noticed, it's prison rules now at V.H.S. Any of us could get killed or buttfucked at any time, which is why I’m offering this pen sized stun gun for the low price of a hundred dollars. I buy in bulk and pass the savings along to you, the consumer.
ABERCROMBIE AND FITCH TEEN BOY Get out of here, spaz.
ZACK
Fuck you guys.
Zack moves to another group of students. Jenko taps Schmidt.
JENKO
Trouble.
CALVIN marches towards them, pissed. He veers towards ZACK. Zack runs, slamming into SALVADOR. Salvador tosses Zack to Calvin, who slamdunks him headfirst into a traschcan.
SCHMIDT
Those gotta be our guys.
JENKO
Get detention, man.
The trashcan with Zack inside rolls by. The BELL RINGS.
33.
INT. SCIENCE CLASSROOM - DAY
Jenko plays with CHEMICALS in the back of a SCIENCE CLASS.
Schmidt walks in and waves to the teacher.
SCHMIDT
I'm 20 minutes late. Detention?
DR. MARCENHOLT, 50, shrugs.
DR. MARCENHOLT
Your life's inevitable failure gives me ultimate vindication. Find a lab partner. You get to cut up a pig today, should be good times for a burgeoning young sociopath.
SCHMIDT
Don't judge me. You don't know me.
You don't know what I been through.
Schmidt sees MOLLY alone at a lab station. He struts down the aisle and sits next to her. She looks up, teary eyed.
SCHMIDT (CONT’D)
Hi. I’m Doug. Are you okay?
Molly begins to nod, then shakes her head.
MOLLY
I miss my lab partner.
SCHMIDT
Billiam?
Molly nods, wiping her tears.
SCHMIDT (CONT’D)
Seems like he was a great guy.
MOLLY
He was. He's irreplaceable.
SCHMIDT
That sucks. I'm really sorry. If it makes you feel any better... 
Schmidt holds up the PIG FOETUS.
SCHMIDT (CONT’D)
This piglet has a huge penis.
Molly stares at Schmidt, mouth ajar.
34.
SCHMIDT (CONT’D)
Are you seeing this? For a piglet, this is serious dong. I hereby christen you "James Woods".
Molly slowly grins. She points at the pig with a scalpel.
MOLLY
Umbilical cord. It's a girl.
SCHMIDT
Oh. Are you of legal voting age?
MOLLY
You want to know if I'm 18?
SCHMIDT
I want to know if you've engaged in the American political process.
MOLLY
I turned 18 this month.
SCHMIDT
Cool. Not that it matters. We're
all teenagers here, right? Heh.
Jeremy and Piz laugh hysterically at the next lab station as they make their foetal pig do the moonwalk.
MOLLY
Shitheads. So many kids are on it.
SCHMIDT
Who sells it?
MOLLY
Why are you asking me that?
Schmidt searches for answer. Suddenly, a loud BANG! Schmidt tackles Molly to the ground.
JENKO
Bitchin'.
Dr. Marcenholt grabs smoking test tubes out of Jenko's hands.
DR. MARCENHOLT
You have quite the aptitude for
chemistry. Some more nitric acid,
you could have incinerated this
entire room and everyone in it.
35.
JENKO
For reals?
Schmidt helps Molly to her feet.
SCHMIDT
Sorry. That’s my brother. He’s an
asshole.
MOLLY
That guy is your brother?
SCHMIDT
Yeah.
MOLLY
Is he older or younger?
SCHMIDT
Younger. By four months.
MOLLY
How is that even possible?
SCHMIDT
Um... my Dad was a pimp, so we came from two of his whores. It was a good year for him. Fertility-wise. Financially, I think we pretty much ruined his life.
At the other side of the room, Jenko corners Mr. Marcenholt.
JENKO
I want to join the Rodeo.
DR. MARCENHOLT
Delroy is the student organizer.
Jenko grabs DELROY, 14, by the shirt as he walks by.
JENKO
You Delroy?
Delroy nods, gulps.
JENKO (CONT’D)
I want to join the Rodeo.
DELROY
The only spot left is the vacancy left by Billiam, but it’s a leadership position and we have some fairly rigorous entrance requirements. So... 
36.
JENKO
You saying I’m not smart enough? I almost just blew up this room and I wasn’t even trying.
DELROY
No, it’s just... 
Jenko stares Delroy down. Delroy pees a little, reaches into his backpack and produces a pin with a tiny yellow lasso.
DELROY (CONT’D)
This is your Lariat of Knowledge.
We meet here at lunch.
Jenko pins the Lariat of Knowledge to his shirt, pleased.
INT. VALLEY HIGH, THE QUAD - DAY
Schmidt and Molly walk towards the CANDACE CAMERON AUDITORIUM.
MOLLY
You tackled me before I even heard the noise. Like it was a reflex.
SCHMIDT
Yeah, well. Lot of drive-by’s where I’m from. Oakland. Oak town. Been through some heavy shit I don’t really want to talk about.
MOLLY
Yeah. Me too.
SCHMIDT
Billiam?
MOLLY
Yeah.
SCHMIDT
When did he get hooked on the shit?
MOLLY
Billiam wasn’t on H.F.S. Okay?
Molly pushes through the Auditorium doors, irritated.
INT. CANDACE CAMERON AUDITORIUM - DAY
MITCH HUPCAKE, 28, ponytailed drama teacher, paces the stage.
37.
MR. HUPCAKE
That’s the problem with staging a
production in the Valley, you’ve
all lived boring, bullshit lives.
He squats and slaps the stage with frustration.
MR. HUPCAKE (CONT’D) That pound of flesh represents the respect Shylock’s people have been denied by the ruling class. Billiam played Shylock with passion and anger! Somebody in this room better bring the heat, or we might as well close this production right now.
Molly raises her hand, speaks with thinly veiled sarcasm.
MOLLY
You should read Doug for the role. He’s from Oakland and apparently he’s been through some heavy shit.
Mr. Hupcake looks Schmidt up and down.
MR. HUPCAKE
For example?
SCHMIDT
For example I saw my Mom get shot
in the face. By my Dad.
Mr. Hupcake covers his mouth in shock.
INT. CANDACE CAMERON AUDITORIUM, LATER - DAY
Schmidt stands center stage, “The Merchant of Venice” in his hands. The entire class watches with rapt attention.
MR. HUPCAKE
Remember. Your daughter just
abandoned you and jacked all your
ducats. Antonio has literally spit on
you for being a Jew.
Schmidt nods, clears his throat... and acts.
SCHMIDT
Hath not a Jew eyes? Hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections, passions;
(MORE)
38.
SCHMIDT (CONT'D)
fed with the same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject to the same diseases, heal'd by the same means, warm'd and cool'd by the same winter and summer as a Christian is? If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die? And if you wrong us, do we not revenge?
Schmidt builds to a climax worthy of Day-Lewis.
SCHMIDT (CONT’D)
If a Jew wrong a Christian, what is his humility? Revenge. If a Christian wrong a Jew, what should his sufferance be by Christian example? Revenge. The villiany you teach me I will execute, and it shall go hard but I will better the instruction... 
The class watches, stunned. Mr. Hupcake stands up.
MR. HUPCAKE
The show goes up in two weeks. We
rehearse every day at lunch.
Schmidt catches Molly’s eye. She looks impressed. He shrugs.
