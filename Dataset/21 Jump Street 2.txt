INT. SCIENCE CLASSROOM - DAY
Jenko stares at four terrified SCIENCE NERDS in orange shirts with BRONCO silhouettes. At the other end of class, BRYAN works with nerds in blue shirts with BULL silhouettes.
JENKO
So. You guys knew Billiam?
DELROY
He was our Team Vaquero.
JENKO
Was he on the shit?
DELROY
No way. He was in four AP classes.
JENKO
Then why did he overdose?
Team Bronco gives a collective shrug. Jenko chuckles.
39.
JENKO (CONT’D)
Man, you guys are so naide.
DELROY
Do you... do you mean “naive”?
JENKO
No.
GUS, a 13 year old Indian boy, pipes up.
GUS
May I ask when we can continue our experiment?
JENKO
Shut up.
GUS
Yes, sir.
JENKO
How smart are you guys? As smart as that guy in the wheelchair?
GUS
Stephen Hawking?
JENKO
No, dickhead. Professor X-man. Are you as smart as him?
Team Bronco gives a collective nod. Jenko gathers them in.
JENKO (CONT’D)
Look, I don’t want to jack fools and pimp bitches for the rest of my life.
GUS
You... pimp bitches?
JENKO
Yeah. But I’m trying to leave that behind. I want to go straight.
GUS
Seriously, do you pimp bitches?
JENKO
I want to go to DeVry Pharmacy School. I’m hella smart, but I can’t get in with my grades. I gotta get noticed.
Jenko speaks in low tones.
40.
JENKO (CONT’D)
Let’s say I got my hands on a dose of H.F.S. Could we reverse-whatever-it to find out what it’s made of?
Team Bronco share a look.
DELROY
Two doses would be preferable, but we could possibly do it with one.
BLAKEY, 14, mildly cross-eyed, greedily rubs his sweaty palms.
BLAKEY
Surely we’d win the Golden Stetson.
JENKO
We’d win the hell out of that shit.
We could get famous and get pussy.
Best way to honor Billiam’s memory.
Gus nods violently. Delroy raises a finger of protest.
DELROY
I think I speak for Team Bronco when I say we are not interested in helping a criminal make his own H.F.S. How do we know you won’t abuse our intelligence?
JENKO
I swear on the Lariat of Knowledge.
Team Bronco shares a look. They give a collective nod.
GUS
I suppose we’ll be doing your work.
JENKO
I do my own work, motherfucker.
Jenko produces the crumpled packet of H.F.S. and shakes out the single dose. Team Bronco gasps.
DELROY
We’re gonna kick the hell out of
Team Bull.
BLAKEY
More like Team Bullshit!
Team Bronco laughs it up. Bryan looks over from across the room. Jenko shoots him a look. Bryan averts his eyes.
41.
JENKO
So. What’s the plan?
DELROY
The Lichtenstein-Gupta Cockroach
dexterity experiment.
JENKO
Bitchin’.
The bell rings.
INT. HALLWAY - DAY
Schmidt and Jenko walk down a long hallway.
JENKO
I’m the King of Science.
SCHMIDT
I’m the King of Shylock.
JENKO
What’s Shylock?
SCHMIDT
Sorry, I forgot you’re illiterate.
JENKO
Man-
SCHMIDT
What did you learn?
JENKO
Those nerds’re gonna help me figure out how H.F.S. is made.
SCHMIDT
I’m sure.
JENKO
Don’t mock, they’re hella smart.
SCHMIDT
Dude, stop saying “hella”.
JENKO
We’re supposed to be from the Bay,
I’ll say it as much as I want.
SCHMIDT
Anything else?
42.
JENKO
They said Billiam didn’t do drugs.
But they’re hella naive.
SCHMIDT
Molly said the same thing.
JENKO
Foul play?
SCHMIDT
Feels like she knows something. I’m gonna try to get it out of her.
JENKO
Just make sure not to put it in her. I saw the way you clocked her at recess. Looked like a cartoon wolf.
The tardy bell rings. Jenko and Schmidt stop outside a class.
JENKO (CONT’D)
Did you get detention yet?
Schmidt shakes his head.
JENKO (CONT’D)
6th period. Tardiness ain't gonna cut it, man. Too much shit has gone down at this school. They're desensitive.
SCHMIDT
What do you want me to do, pull my dick out in front of everybody?
Jenko shrugs and enters class. After a moment of thought, Schmidt unzips his fly, pulls his dick out and enters.
INT. PRINCIPAL WHITEMAN'S OFFICE - DAY
Principal Whiteman stares across his desk at Schmidt.
PRINCIPAL WHITEMAN
Detention.
INT. DETENTION - DAY
Jenko and Schmidt enter a dim, moldy classroom. MR. DADIER, 67, glances up from behind a Sodoku puzzle, afraid.
MR. DADIER
They’re not here yet.
43.
Jenko and Schmidt take a seat across from ZACK, who nervously gulps another Red Bull and clutches his backpack tightly.
ZACK
Either of you in the market for 3rd row Jonas Brothers tickets or a slightly used MP3 player? Word has it you're unreasonably violent, can I interest you in exchanging contraband for personal protection?
Schmidt and Jenko glare at Zack. He shuts up.
THE GANG slowly enter in lock step. They sit around Zack, encircling him like lions might encircle a baby zebra. Salvador slips on CHROME KNUCKLES and raps on Zack’s desk.
CALVIN
What's in the bag. Zachary.
Boris shoots Zack in the face with a rubberband. Shea grabs Zack's backpack and shakes it. A used MP3 player falls out, breaking in half. Two concert tickets float to the floor.
SALVADOR
That don't look like our money,
holmes. Look like some bullshit.
ZACK
I just need a couple days, I-
Shea explodes into laughter as he reads the concert tickets.
SHEA
This motherfucker goin' to “The
Jonas Brothers.”
The Gang laughs. Shea tears the tickets into pieces. Zack winces. Calvin leans in close, breathing down Zack's neck.
CALVIN
You got one day, Zachary.
JENKO (O.S.)
Yo.
Calvin looks up to see JENKO leaning against his desk.
JENKO (CONT’D)
We’re the McQuaid brothers. I’m
Brad, that’s Doug.
Schmidt stands into frame, arms crossed.
44.
SCHMIDT
We’re professional ass kickers. We want to work for you.
The Gang walks over to Schmidt and Jenko.
SHEA
Fuck you, narc.
Schmidt blinks.
SCHMIDT
I’m not a narc. You’re a narc.
SALVADOR
Know who calls dudes narcs?
Pich spins a THROWING KNIFE through his fingers and touches the gleaming tip to Schmidt’s chin.
PICH
Narcs. Narc.
SCHMIDT
Unless you’re a narc, your argument just totally collapsed.
JENKO
You want to see if we’re narcs?
Let’s go do some dirt.
Calvin looks them over with an unblinking gaze.
CALVIN
Meet us at the mall. 6 p.m. Macy’s.
The Gang exit. Shea throws a fake punch at Mr. Dadier.
INT. BOY'S BATHROOM - DAY
Schmidt kicks the BOYS ROOM door open. Jenko checks stalls.
JENKO
FUCK YEAH!
SCHMIDT
They’re buying it.
JENKO
Man, those guys look at least 22.
45.
SCHMIDT
We make detective off this for sure, as long as we don’t do something incredibly stupid. Just gotta show them how hardcore we are. Remember the first and last Commandment.
JENKO
Never blow your cover.
SCHMIDT
Never blow your cover.
A FART echoes. Moments later, a toilet goes FLUSHHH. A stall door creaks open. ZACK emerges, wearing headphones. He walks between Schmidt and Jenko and washes his hands, wide-eyed.
SCHMIDT (CONT’D)
Is it that pink, granular shit?
ZACK
Huh?
Jenko lifts Zack up and SLAMS him against the wall.
SCHMIDT
Why are you spying on us?
ZACK
I'm not! I just came in here to
blow some mud!
JENKO
Why didn't I see your feet?
ZACK
I'm short!
SCHMIDT
What did you hear?
ZACK
Nothing, I was listening to music!
Zack holds up half an MP3 player. Jenko swats it away.
JENKO
You tell anyone what you heard, you get us killed. And if you get us killed? I'm gonna kill you.
ZACK
You're cops. You can’t kill me.
46.
Jenko and Schmidt share a quick look. Fuck.
ZACK (CONT’D)
I swear to God I won't tell anyone.
As long as you settle my debt.
JENKO
What debt?
ZACK
They're taxing my black market sales. By the way if you guys ever need throwing stars or anything I can hook that up.
SCHMIDT
How much do you owe?
ZACK
More than you can possibly imagine.
JENKO
How much?
ZACK
Three hundred dollars.
Schmidt pulls out $300 and waves it in front of Zack’s face.
SCHMIDT
Smell that? Smells like Vanessa Hudgens pussy. It’s yours if you tell us everything you know about H.F.S.
Jenko sets Zack on the floor. Zack speaks very fast.
ZACK
The guys in detention sell it they run the whole school they beat the crap out of whoever they want and they always get away with it cause people who mess with them get killed.
SCHMIDT
How much of that did you make up?
80 percent?
ZACK
If you don't believe me, ask
Billiam Williams. Oh that's right
you can't. He's dead.
JENKO
You think they killed Billiam?
47.
ZACK
Wow, it’s like you’re the
reincarnation of Sherlock Holmes.
Jenko picks Zack back up and slams him against the wall.
JENKO
Just because we can’t kill you doesn’t mean we won’t beat the shit out of you without leaving any marks. What else do you know?
ZACK
They do big sales at b-ball games
and afterparties. Away games too.
SCHMIDT
Who makes it?
ZACK
Don’t know but he’s a genius. It starts off like you’re making love to a cloud and then it turns into the best trip ever no spiders or demons just naked black chicks and the face of God and then you get a crazy rush like you just drank ten Red Bulls it’s such good shit. Supposedly.
Schmidt and Jenko share a look.
SCHMIDT
Are you a shithead?
ZACK
No way, Drugs Are Dangerous. Hey when this is over can I shoot one of your guns preferably a .38 automatic?
JENKO
That is never, ever going to happen. Just keep your mouth shut.
SCHMIDT
You blow our cover, we’ll plant
heroin on you and send you to CYA
with 17 year old rapist killers.
ZACK
Cover my debt with those psychos
you got nothing to worry about.
Schmidt hands him $300. Zack holds a fist out, gets no bump.
48.
ZACK (CONT’D)
So. See you guys at Flat Top?
SCHMIDT
What’s Flat Top?
ZACK
It’s where the party is Fryfrynay.
JENKO
What’s Fryfrynay?
INT. JUMP STREET CHAPEL, LUNCH TABLE - NIGHT
Dicks, Grady, Jackson and Lucy debrief Schmidt and Jenko.
JENKO
Since when did "Fryfrynay" become
"Friday night"?
JACKSON
Since three months ago. Y’all
better hope on Urban Dictionary
with a quickness.
GRADY
Jesus in a gay porn theater, you guys are the worst undercover cops since Leonardo DiCaprio. A gang of five guys? I'd have those dickbags working for me by now.
SCHMIDT
We just found out how they're
expanding their market.
Jenko displays the SPORTS section of the SHARK ATTACK WEEKLY.
JENKO
V.H.S. vs. The Camino Palominos.
Quarterfinals. Go Sharks.
Captain Dicks SLAM the pulpit with his X-Treme Gulp cup.
CAPTAIN DICKS
Motherfucker do you know how fucked
this unit is if we let the shit
spread to other schools?
SCHMIDT
Sir, we’re gonna get in the gang. We’re meeting them at the mall right now, probably to shoplift.
49.
Dicks and Grady share a look.
INT. EVIDENCE LOCKER - DAY
Grady hands Schmidt a backpack full of 100 dollar bills.
JENKO
Why are you giving us 50 grand?
GRADY
They didn’t invite you to shoplift, they invited you to see if you got drug dealer money. Go spend this.
You’re on the hook for everything you buy, so keep the fuckin’ receipts.
INT. TOPANGA MALL, MACY’S - EVENING
GHOSTFACE KILLAH, “Kilo”. Jenko and Schmidt stride through the mall with the Gang.
-	Jenko pays 1,000 cash for Gucci eyeglasses. Schmidt spends 1,000 cash on a chain with blinged out tragedy/comedy faces.
-	Cash slides across counters in one direction. Clothes and bling slide across in the other.
INT. TOPANGA MALL - EVENING
Schmidt, Jenko and the Gang stride through the mall. Jenko looks into VICTORIA’S SECRET and sees REGAN walking out.
Jenko SHOVES Regan back into Victoria’s Secret. She ricochets off two manikins and falls down. The Gang laughs it up.
INT. JUMP STREET CHAPEL - NIGHT
A saxophone softly plays the Jump Street theme tune. Schmidt and Jenko give Grady the merchandise they just bought.
GRADY
Receipts.
They hand over a stack of receipts.
GRADY (CONT’D)
This is everything?
SCHMIDT/JENKO
Yup.
50.
Captain Dicks stops playing the saxophone.
CAPTAIN DICKS
If they jump you in, take a few punches but don’t act a bitch. Drop your homework off with Truman.
JENKO
I do my own homework.
Schmidt looks at Jenko. Jenko shrugs.
INT. SAUSALITO ARMS - NIGHT
Jenko wears Gucci glasses, reads “The Red Badge of Courage”.
INT. THE SCHMIDT HOME, BATHROOM - NIGHT
Schmidt wears the chain with blinged out drama faces. He stares at a row of Axe body sprays, telephone to ear.
SCHMIDT
Hi, is Molly there?
MOLLY (O.S.)
This is she.
Schmidt reaches for “Axe Instinct,” puts it back.
SCHMIDT
Hey it’s Doug.
MOLLY (O.S.)
Oh, hey. What’s up? You were
really, really amazing today.
Schmidt grabs “Axe Dark Temptation,” hoses himself down.
SCHMIDT
Thanks. Hey, I was wondering if you were going to the game tonight?
MOLLY (O.S.)
Yeah, a couple friends are taking me. It’s my first night out since-
The sound of DIALING blots out Molly’s words.
SCHMIDT
MOM, I’M ON THE PHONE!
51.
INT. SAUSALITO ARMS - NIGHT
Jenko hurls a CHEMISTRY book across the room. He cracks a beer and rips open a GIGANTOR bag of Cool Ranch Doritos.
INT. THE SCHMIDT HOME - NIGHT
Schmidt creeps through the foyer. Just as he reaches the front door, ANNIE steps in and blocks it.
ANNIE
Where are you going?
SCHMIDT
Out.
ANNIE
Where did you get that necklace?
It’s tacky. Are you dealing drugs?
SCHMIDT
For Christ’s sake, Mom. I’m a cop.
ANNIE
You smell like a Hershey bar. When are you getting home? You live here and we still hardly see you. Stay and watch “Deal or No Deal” with me.
David walks through the foyer.
DAVID
He’s a full grown man, Annie. He doesn’t want to watch “Deal or No Deal” with his Mom on a Friday night.
Annie runs up to David and punches him in the back.
ANNIE
Nobody’s asking you, David!
Schmidt runs for it. Annie yells out the front door.
ANNIE (CONT’D)
I LOVE YOU!
EXT. CAMINO GYM - NIGHT
The VISITOR side cheers, including Molly and friends in the front row. Schmidt sits next to her, eyes cooly scanning the gym. The ball POOMS off his face. The crowd goes "OHHHHHHH!"
52.
MOLLY
Oh my God, are you alright?
SCHMIDT
YEP.
Blood pours from Schmidt’s nose. He stuffs it with a napkin.
SCHMIDT (CONT’D)
So. You’re playing Portia?
MOLLY
Yeah. Have you ever acted before?
SCHMIDT
I’ve bullshitted my way out of
getting shot a few times.
MOLLY
I couldn’t even imagine that till this year. I used to think life was all unicorns and frozen yogurt.
SCHMIDT
What’s life now?
MOLLY
Life is a toy for Death to play with.
Schmidt is affected. A hot dog hits him in the head.
INT. CAMINO GYM - CONTINUOUS
From the empty back row, Jenko throws another hot dog at Schmidt, nailing him in the back. Schmidt turns around, pissed. He stomps up and sits next to Jenko.
JENKO
Are you on a date?
SCHMIDT
No, dick. I'm on an investigation.
JENKO
(gravel)
We find these assholes and execute the infiltration. Now.
Jenko heads down the steps. Schmidt follows.
SCHMIDT
I'm throwing away your Miami Vice
Blu-ray.
53.
JENKO
You seriously better not.
EXT. CAMINO GYM - NIGHT
Jenko and Schmidt walk a dark, subterranean corridor in front of the Camino Gym. THE GANG stands at the far end.
CALVIN
Shea saw you inside with that bitch
Molly. What up with that?
SCHMIDT
Nothing. Except I fucked her.
CALVIN
You really fucked her?
SCHMIDT
Yeah.
Calvin’s eyes go dark.
CALVIN
You stay away from that bitch.
SCHMIDT
Yeah, dawg. No problem.
SHEA
Y’all from Oakland? What you claim?
JENKO
We’re independent.
PICH
Why you got transferred here?
SCHMIDT
Ghost Town had contracts on us for selling rock in their schools.
SHEA
Bullllshit.
SALVADOR
Look like a couple pinche putos.
SCHMIDT
You want to see if we’re putos? Let’s start some shit. I will fuck up any motherfucker steps to me.
54.
Suddenly, a big angry voice booms from behind:
ANGRY WHITE BOY (O.S.)
THIS IS OUR SCHOOL, BITCHES!
SCHMIDT
(under his breath)
Shit.
Schmidt and Jenko turn around to see four ANGRY WHITE BOYS: teen gang members dressed in Levi's and white T-shirts. Schmidt looks back to Calvin, who grins and nods.
TIM, 18, leader of the AWB's, steps forward holding NUNCHUCKS.
TIM
What up?
SCHMIDT
Are those seriously nunchuks? How
old are you, twelve?
TIM
These nunchucks will kill your ass!
JENKO
The zebra shits at dawn.
SCHMIDT
He sure as shit does.
Schmidt CHARGES with surprising speed. Tim raises his nunchucks but Schmidt TACKLES him through the other AWB's.
Jenko races up and PUNCHES the closest AWB in the face. POW! Jenko gets punched hard in the eye. He pulls his assailant's t-shirt over his head and pummels his stomach.
Schmidt sends overhand rights into the biggest Angry White Boy's stupefied face. Jenko drops an AWB with a chokehold.
Schmidt finishes the last AWB, savagely kicking him in the balls while he’s on the ground. He brushes his shoulders off and holds his arms out to Calvin.
SCHMIDT (CONT’D)
What up?
Calvin points at Schmidt's stomach. Schmidt looks down to see a BUTTERFLY KNIFE sticking out of his torso.
SCHMIDT (CONT’D)
When did I get stabbed?
55.
TIM suddenly stands behind Schmidt, nunchucks spinning.
BLAMBLAMBLAM! Bullets spark off the ground.
CALVIN aims a smoking .357 MAGNUM at Tim. Everyone else in the Gang reveal guns in their waistbands.
CALVIN
Tell your homies this is why you don't bring a knife to a gunfight.
Tim drops his nunchucks. Calvin aims the .357 at Schmidt.
CALVIN (CONT’D)
You two. Meet us at Flat Top.
The Gang drifts away.
INT. THE EMERGENCY ROOM - NIGHT
Jenko helps Schmidt to the Emergency Room check-in counter.
SCHMIDT
Hi I have a knife sticking out of me.
INT. THE EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY
DR. CAROLINE, 30, Indian, sanitizes the area around the knife.
SCHMIDT
From now on, we pack heat.
JENKO
"Pack heat"?
DR. CAROLINE
This will hurt. Try not to spaz.
She slowly pulls the knife out of Schmidt's midsection.
SCHMIDT
Actually not that painful. I'm just gonna pass out for a se-
Schmidt falls off the gurney and BANGS his head on a shelf.
INT. GRADY'S SUPERBEE - NIGHT
Jenko and GRADY help Schmidt into the back seat of Grady's mint condition lime green '68 SUPERBEE.
56.
GRADY
Don't yak in my 'Bee, motherfucker.
I'll kick your fuckin' ass.
JENKO
Lay off, man. He just got stabbed.
GRADY
And what happened to you? Kicked in the pussy? Sit in the back.
INT. GRADY'S SUPERBEE - NIGHT
The Superbee cruises through the Valley, passing strip malls.
GRADY
You lucky, lucky assholes. You have no idea how lucky you have it.
Grady rides hard over a bump. Schmidt winces.
GRADY (CONT’D)
That's the problem with this unit. You turn 30, it's like you're middle age Rebecca DeMornay. Nobody wants you anymore. Just when you finally got it wired. And you two idiots get to be in the field while I go home to a bitch wife and two half-retarded daughters. It STINKS.
Grady punches the steering wheel and turns to Schmidt.
GRADY (CONT’D)
Did I read in your report you’re
starring in the school play? How
many drama geeks pushin’ weight?
(to Jenko)
And you. Team Bronco?
Grady punches the steering wheel.
GRADY (CONT’D)
I need less Anthony Michael Hall
and more Judd Fucking Nelson!
SCHMIDT
Get us to Flat Top. We'll be in the
Gang before the sun is up.
Grady punches the steering wheel.
57.
GRADY
That’s how you party.
He tosses Schmidt a bottle of pills.
GRADY (CONT’D)
Oxy for your boo-boo. Don’t take ‘em all, I gotta sleep tonight.
Grady stomps the gas pedal.
EXT. FLAT TOP - NIGHT
The Superbee’s tires smoke, leaving Schmidt and Jenko behind.
They stand in a cul de sac with half-constructed homes. A STUDENT exits a partially constructed home, barfs, throws a karate kick and heads back in. Jenko sighs, nostalgic.
VOICE (O.S.)
Brad, can you get us in the party?
Jenko turns to see a nervous Delroy and Gus.
DELROY
We were hoping to observe those
under the influence.
JENKO
Fuck off. I’m serious.
Delroy and Gus hang their heads, wounded.
JENKO (CONT’D)
Alright, come on. But be careful.
GUS
Are you considering pimping any
bitches tonight?
INT. FLAT TOP PARTY - NIGHT
Jenko, Schmidt, Delroy and Gus enter the house. Music bumps.
Kids are on the shit. Two girls dance and make out.
GUS
Xanadu.
Jenko and Schmidt head straight for the Gang in the den.
58.
INT. FLAT TOP PARTY, THE DEN - NIGHT
A kid buys H.F.S. from Shea. Schmidt and Jenko nod to Calvin.
SCHMIDT
We down or what?
CALVIN
Pleasure before business.
Shea presses something into Jenko's hand. Jenko opens it to find two packets of “H.F.S.”
SHEA
Bet you can’t eat just one of them shits.
JENKO
This isn't really a Holy Fuckin'
Shit kind of party.
CALVIN
Boris gettin' righteous, let's ask him. Hey Boris. This a Holy Fuckin’ Shit kind of party?
BORIS
Shit yeah.
Jenko opens the packet and empties it into his mouth, crunching up a huge wad of H.F.S. Schmidt follows suit.
INT. FLAT TOP PARTY, BATHROOM - NIGHT
Schmidt BARFS. Jenko pulls his finger away, too late.
JENKO
You disgusting asshole, you just
barfed on my finger.
Jenko wipes his finger on drywall in the bathroom.
SCHMIDT
I can't put my own finger down my
throat, I know where it's been.
JENKO
Lemme show you how it’s done.
Jenko takes over at the toilet, sticks a different finger down his throat and GAGS. His face goes bright red, but no barf. He tries again and gags even harder... still no barf.
59.
JENKO (CONT’D)
Shit!
Schmidt shock-jams his finger down Jenko's throat and quickly removes it. Jenko barfs a rainbow of Hot Pockets.
SCHMIDT
Notice there's no barf on my finger.
Jenko stands up and wipes his mouth.
JENKO
That shit tasted familiar... 
They turn on the faucet to wash hands. No water comes out.
SCHMIDT
Do you remember the order of high?
JENKO
Stoned, tripping, tweaking.
SCHMIDT
Let's party. Keep it subtle.
JON SPENCER BLUES EXPLOSION'S "Fuck Shit Up" kicks in.
INT. FLAT TOP PARTY - PARTY MONTAGE
-	Jenko and Schmidt stumble around the party like they're insanely wasted. They slide to the ground heads nodding. They stare at their hands like whoaaaaah. Boris spies on them.
-	Salvador spies on Schmidt as he massages his pants.
SCHMIDT
Nylon is so fucking amazing. Ha ha!
-	Jenko stomp dances alone in the middle of the living room. Gus and Delroy huddle in a corner, sharing a cup of beer.
GUS
Do you think he’s shitting?
DELROY
Definitely.
GUS
We should leave.
DELROY
Fantastic idea, Gus.
60.
Delroy and Gus stand up. Schmidt screams in their faces.
SCHMIDT
HIGH FIVE, MOTHERFUCKERS. Ha ha ha!
Delroy and Gus run away.
-	Schmidt and Jenko slam dance to Bad Religion’s “Do What You Want”, working up a heavy sweat. Calvin watches them from the other room, arms crossed. The music gets louder and louder.
INT. FLAT TOP PARTY, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Molly enters the party with two girlfriends. She scans the crowd, wary. A girl falls in front of her and has a seizure.
SALVADOR
Goddamn bitch, do that in the
seizure room.
Molly watches in horror as Salvador drags the girl away. A hand lands on her shoulder. She spins around, frightened.
SCHMIDT
What up Molls!
Schmidt tries to hug Molly. She backs away.
MOLLY
You’re sweating like crazy.
SCHMIDT
Just doing a little stomp dancing, breaking fools down.
MOLLY
You ditched me at the game.
SCHMIDT
Sorry, went to get some nachos and got involved in a mild stabbing.
Schmidt lifts his shirt, flashes his bandaged wound.
MOLLY
Oh my God, are you okay?
SCHMIDT
That shit happens all the time, no big thang. Sometimes if I’m carrying a knife and I don’t have anywhere to put it, I just stick it in myself so I can have two free hands.
61.
Jenko approaches, hands Schmidt a beer.
JENKO
Hey, Doug. Come here.
SCHMIDT
Not really, Brad.
Jenko physically drags Schmidt away from Molly.
SCHMIDT (CONT’D)
King Cockblock returns.
JENKO
Are you serious? Whatever the
opposite of a magnet is, that's
what you are to pussy.
SCHMIDT
I want to talk to her about
Billiam. She knows something.
JENKO
He’s watching. Act like I just told you the funniest thing in the world.
Schmidt glances over Jenko’s shoulder: Calvin eyes them from the other room, stone faced. Schmidt breaks into piercing laughter and falls down, dragging Jenko with him.
Calvin cracks a grin, turns his attention elsewhere.
Molly leaves the party. Schmidt jumps up and runs after her.
EXT. FLAT TOP PARTY - CONTINUOUS
Schmidt walks down the driveway with Molly.
SCHMIDT
You’re leaving?
MOLLY
I'm not comfortable around shitheads.
SCHMIDT
Are you saying I'm a shithead?
Molly’s friend pulls her away, leaving Schmidt behind.
SCHMIDT (CONT’D)
I'm not a shithead.
Molly disappears down the street.
62.
SCHMIDT (CONT’D)
Shit.
Jenko sneaks up behind Schmidt and massages his temples.
JENKO
Do you know how hard I would fuck
that girl if I was allowed?
Schmidt violently shrugs Jenko off.
EXT. ABANDONED CUL DE SAC - NIGHT
Jenko and Schmidt stand in the chaparral behind the cul de sac. They face the Gang with clenched jaws and bugged eyes.
SCHMIDT
Awesome drug.
JENKO
Hella awesome.
Boris throws Schmidt and Jenko two BLACKBERRIES.
CALVIN
You get a text, it means I need you to keep Dean Stanton away from the North side of campus. Don’t fuck up.
Schmidt and Jenko nod. The Gang disperse into the night.
JENKO
I feel the need to shoot guns and
grab my dick.
SCHMIDT
I share that feeling.
MONTAGE SCORED BY A 16TH NOTE FUNK BEAT OF GUNFIRE:
EXT. DESOLATE LOS ANGELES OIL FIELD - DAWN

SCHMIDT
We’re Super Cops.
JENKO
We’re Robocops.
SCHMIDT
We’re Al Pacino in "Serpico".
JENKO
I'm Al Pacino in "Serpico". You're
Al Pacino in "Cruisin'".
Schmidt pushes Jenko. Jenko trips on a basketball, rolls, grabs the shotgun and BLASTS the head off the Celtics manikin. Jenko and Schmidt high five. FREEZE FRAME.
INT. THE SCHMIDT HOME - MORNING
Fruity Pebbles rattle into a bowl, followed by milk. Puffy-eyed Schmidt sits at the breakfast table with his parents.
ANNIE
Where were you all night?
SCHMIDT
Working.
ANNIE
Till 7 in the morning? Is part of
your job getting drunk?
Schmidt concentrates very hard on his Fruity Pebbles.
DAVID
Annie-
ANNIE
No, I’m sorry David, I do not understand how this is acceptable in our house. He reeks of booze and... 
Annie puts her nose on Schmidt’s shirt and sniffs deeply.
ANNIE (CONT’D)
What is that?
SCHMIDT
Gunpowder.
64.
DAVID
Annie, he’s a 23 yea-
ANNIE
WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS INTERRUPTING ME?
Schmidt slowly wraps his fingers around a butter knife.
INT. CANDACE CAMERON AUDITORIUM - DAY
Schmidt cuts an SFX pound of pectoral flesh from the screaming boy playing “Antonio”. He raises the bloody flesh to the sky.
SCHMIDT
I... am content!
Mr. Hupcake claps, then chews thoughtfully on his braid.
MR. HUPCAKE
It’s almost the perfect ending, but it’s missing one thing. Sex.
INT. SCIENCE CLASSROOM - DAY
Jenko stares at five GIANT MALAYSIAN COCKROACHES crawling all over each other.
JENKO
They’re totally gonna fuck.
Jenko lifts his head above the glass “EXPERIMENT ARENA” and looks at Team Bronco. Delroy, Gus and the rest of the team sit across from him with their arms crossed, glaring.
JENKO (CONT’D)
What’s wrong with you guys?
DELROY
Do you really want to know? Do you?
Gus stands up and raises his little fist.
GUS
You told us you wanted to go to
DeVry, but you are just a drug
addict like the rest of them.
JENKO
Man, that’s what I get for taking a couple little girls into a big boy party. I was faking, okay? I wanted the gang to think I was shitting.
65.
GUS
Why?
Jenko reaches behind Gus’ ear and produces an H.F.S. WAFER.
JENKO
So I could get another dose of
H.F.S. for the experiment, ya’ spaz.
Team Bronco eagerly inspects the wafer. Blakey rubs his hands.
BLAKEY
This vastly improves our chances.
JENKO
I get to name the cockroaches.
INT. CANDACE CAMERON AUDITORIUM - DAY
Schmidt and Molly stand face to face. Mr. Hupcake circles.
MR. HUPCAKE
Portia, when Shylock cuts his pound of flesh, it triggers something primal, deep within you. Look into his eyes.
Molly looks into Schmidt’s eyes, nervous.
MR. HUPCAKE (CONT’D)
You think to yourself, “all Bassanio had to do was pick the right coffin. But this man. This sexual man. This strong man. This man can protect me. I find myself drawn to him.”
Molly and Schmidt’s faces draw closer together.
MR. HUPCAKE (CONT’D)
Closer and closer. Closer and closer.
And... you kiss.
Just before they kiss, Molly backs away with a start.
MOLLY
I’m sorry... 
Molly runs backstage. Schmidt snaps out of it and follows.
INT. SCIENCE CLASSROOM - DAY
Delroy and Jenko into the Experiment Arena.
66.
DELROY
We use your first dose to feed them equal portions of H.F.S, except Colin Farrell. He gets a placebo.
JENKO
Sorry Colin.
GUS
We use your second dose to analyze the formula.
Gus and Blakey work with intense focus at their tiny lab. Gus hands Jenko a sheet of equations.
GUS (CONT’D)
This is your share of the work.
Your equations are fairly linear.
Jenko scans the equations, brow furrowed.
JENKO
Yeah, no prob.
DELROY
Once we make our own dose, we’ll
know we’ve succeeded if the
cockroaches repeat the behavior
we’re about to witness now.
Delroy feeds four cockroaches tiny portions of H.F.S.
JENKO
McSorely, Pedro Guerrero, Kareem,
Magic? I want you to enjoy this.
Delroy videotapes as the cockroaches devour the H.F.S.
DELROY
It’s a frenzy. They’re attacking
each other for crumbs.
JENKO
They’re trippin’ balls. Kareem’s
just walking in a big spiral.
INT. CANDACE CAMERON AUDITORIUM, PROP ROOM - LATER
Molly and Schmidt sit on a trunk full of tie-dyed dresses.
67.
MOLLY
I always end up getting really close with the people I act with. But I don’t think I can do that with you.
SCHMIDT
Why? I thought we were kind of
getting to be friends.
MOLLY
You’re not being honest about who
you are. Like, at the party.
SCHMIDT
You think I was on the shit.
MOLLY
Were you?
SCHMIDT
Molly, I swear on my Mom’s face, I’m not a shithead. When I party, sometimes I get into a primal state of dance and it puts me in a weird place. But doing stuff like that just adds to my character. For this play.
MOLLY
You have to be careful around those guys. Do know the real reason Billiam died?
SCHMIDT
No.
MOLLY
Do you want to?
SCHMIDT
Yes.
MOLLY
If you care about me, you’ll never tell anyone what I’m about to say.
SCHMIDT
I promise. I promise big time.
MOLLY
He died because he saw something.
A BLACKBERRY goes off, ringtone - DR. DRE, “Bitches Ain’t Shit”. Schmidt retrieves a text that says: “DEAN STANTON”
68.
Schmidt shoves the Blackberry back in his pocket.
SCHMIDT
Sorry, sorry, what did he see?
Molly begins to speak. The ringtone goes off again. Schmidt reads another text: “RIGHT NOW”
SCHMIDT (CONT’D)
My brother’s in trouble. I really want to talk more about this.
MOLLY
Forget it.
SCHMIDT
Don’t say that. I’m sorry.
Schmidt runs out. RUN D.M.C. “Raising Hell” over:
INT. VALLEY HIGH, HALLWAY - DAY
Schmidt opens his locker. Jenko struggles with the combo, finally gets it. Their lockers are filled with NON-LETHAL WEAPONS. They grab a FLASH BANG GRENADE and PEPPER SPRAY.
They walk down the hallway. Jenko cracks the DEAN OF DISCIPLINE office door. Schmidt tosses the Flash Bang in.
BANG! White light FLASHES around the door frame.
Schmidt kicks the door open. Dean Stanton staggers around, totally blinded. Jenko unloads the pepper spray on his face. Stanton goes down screaming. Schmidt and Jenko quickly exit.
INT. SCIENCE CLASSROOM - DAY
Jenko and Team Bronco pull a small wafer from a steaming test tube. Jenko gets a text message and quickly exits.
EXT. THE QUAD - CONTINUOUS
Dean Stanton walks the Quad, scanning for trouble. The blast of a firehose hits him in the head, knocking him down.
INT. CANDACE CAMERON AUDITORIUM
Schmidt and Molly’s faces get closer. They stop just before kissing and laugh. Mr. Hupcake throws a serious hissy fit.
69.
INT. VALLEY HIGH, HALLWAY - DAY
Schmidt throws STINK BOMBS into Stanton’s office as Jenko HOSES the area in front of his door with ANTI-TRACTION FOAM.
Stanton runs out, hits the foam, slides into a trophy case and shatters it. He tries to chase them but can only run in place.
INT. SCIENCE CLASSROOM - DAY
Four cockroaches run away from tiny doses of H.F.S.
DELROY
They’re running away from it.
GUS
I don’t get it. If our math is right, we’ve replicated every ingredient of the formula except for one.
DELROY
Sodium Caseinate. But it’s
inactive, it can’t make you high.
JENKO
Maybe it does something else. Like make it taste good.
DELROY
Solid hypothesis, Brad. But it costs too much to make on a small scale. Based on the street value of H.F.S., I don’t see how they use Sodium Caseinate and still make money.
Team Bronco scratch their heads. The bell rings.
INT. DETENTION - DAY
Calvin hands Schmidt and Jenko a stack of cash.
JENKO
When do we start selling?
CALVIN
Next year. At a different school.
SCHMIDT
But we’re seniors.
CALVIN
Big Man takes care of that.
70.
SCHMIDT
When do we meet Big Man?
Calvin stares a hole through Schmidt.
CALVIN
When do you need to?
Schmidt shrugs lamely.
INT. JUMP STREET CHAPEL, PULPIT - DAY
Schmidt and Jenko sit in the front pew as Dicks paces the pulpit, sipping an X-TREME GULP. Grady sits behind his desk.
GRADY
So to sum it up, you’ve been workin’ these guys for two weeks and have exactly dick for evidence.
SCHMIDT
We’re getting promoted next year.
Dicks glares at Schmidt, sips hard on his X-treme Gulp.
JENKO
I’m on the verge of finding out how the shit is made.
SCHMIDT
And I’m close to finding out what really happened to Billiam. I suspect foul play, we just need more time-
Dicks throws 50 ounces of Mountain Dew in Schmidt’s face and hurls the empty X-treme Gulp cup at Jenko’s head.
CAPTAIN DICKS
TIME IS A LUXURY I DO NOT HAVE,
MOTHERFUCKERS.
Dicks sits on the edge of the Pulpit, head in his hands.
CAPTAIN DICKS (CONT’D)
I apologize for the beverage. Got
some heavy shit going down in the
personal life.
Schmidt wipes his face off. Jenko rubs his head.
JENKO
We’re doing the best we can, sir.
71.
Dicks looks up at the cross hanging over Grady’s smug face.
CAPTAIN DICKS
That’s not good enough.
INT. HEALTH CLASS - MORNING
Jenko and Schmidt enter Health Class as the tardy bell rings.
GRADY (O.S.)
You're late, assclowns.
The class laughs. Jenko and Schmidt turn to see GRADY at the head of the class, wearing blue jeans, a "Deep Purple" t-shirt and a sport coat with one button.
GRADY (CONT’D)
Sit.
Jenko and Schmidt sit, stunned. Grady addresses the class.
GRADY (CONT’D)
I'm Mr. Rogers, your sub for the final week. We got a guest speaker, so chill out, take a nap, whatever, just don’t talk while he’s talking.
WALT nervously turns on the OVERHEAD PROJECTOR and projects a graph entitled “FUN IN LIFE VS. DRUGS.” He clears his throat.
WALT
Drugs! They really stink. Lives get ruined. Water down the sink. Science has proven that fun in life is inversely proportional to drugs.
JENKO
I do too many drugs to understand
what the hell you just said.
Kids snicker.
WALT
It means the more you use drugs,
the less fun you'll have.
SCHMIDT
That’s actually untrue. I’ve done several drugs and I can assure you it’s a great time.
72.
WALT
I always thought you had to be alive to have a good time. And drugs can kill you, like they killed my son.
CONCERNED GIRL
How did your son die?
WALT
Lance drank a lot of beer, which is a drug. One night, he decided to urinate off the subway platform. He was instantly electrocuted.
Everyone struggles not to laugh.
