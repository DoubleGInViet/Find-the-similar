WALT (CONT’D)
Let’s pow-wow. I know you have this new H.S.S. drug going around.
JENKO
H.F.S.
WALT
Did you know that this year, one in 10 million kids will die from doing drugs like H.F.S. on Prom night. One in 10 million. Are those odds you're really willing to face just to have a good time and get “laid”?
The class responds with a resounding "Hell yeah!" Walt's face turns red. He rushes the big finish.
WALT (CONT’D)
Well, remember, when in doubt? D.A.D!
Drugs Are Dangerous. Questions?
SCHMIDT
All you do is make drugs sound cool. Sorry your kid was a bad drunk, but this isn’t helping. Kids do drugs so they can deal with a with clueless, white-bread parents like you.
WALT
That’s more of a comment, did you
have a question?
SCHMIDT
Yeah, my question is why don’t you stop preaching on shit you know nothing about, hop in your DAD-mobile and fuck the fuck off?
73.
The class erupts in riotous cheers.
GRADY
You two. Principal’s office.
Walt gathers his stuff and beats a hasty retreat.
INT. PRINCIPAL WHITEMAN’S OUTER OFFICE - DAY
Principal Whiteman’s extremely HOT SECRETARY puts lipstick on. Schmidt and Jenko head for Whiteman’s private office.
SECRETARY
He’s at a meeting.
SCHMIDT
We’ll wait in here.
They enter the office.
INT. PRINCIPAL WHITEMAN’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Schmidt and Jenko shut the door tightly.
JENKO
That dick is stealing our case.
SCHMIDT
We need evidence. Watch the door.
Schmidt rifles through files. He pulls one out.
SCHMIDT (CONT’D)
Calvin turns 22 next month.
JENKO
I knew it. I knew it.
SCHMIDT
Who has the power to re-enroll a
senior four years in a row?
Jenko scratches his head.
SCHMIDT (CONT’D)
The Principal, you fuckin’ idiot!
JENKO
Don’t call me a fuckin’ idiot.
Footsteps approach. They dive for chairs just as Whiteman enters. He sits behind his desk, looks around the room.
74.
PRINCIPAL WHITEMAN
Why are you here?
JENKO
We messed with the Drugs guy.
PRINCIPAL WHITEMAN
If you feel the need for detention, you can just ask me personally. There’s no need to harass Walt. After all, he is your D.A.D.
Principal Whiteman grins a yellow-toothed grin.
INT. DETENTION - DAY
Jenko and Schmidt sit with the Gang in detention. Boris sells a packet of H.F.S. to Zack. Jenko and Schmidt glare at him. He gives a tiny shrug.
BAM! Grady kicks the door open. He puts a foot on Zack’s ass kick-shoves him out the door.
GRADY
I’m teaching detention now.
MR. DADIER
Thank you, Jesus.
GRADY
No prob.
Mr. Dadier exits. Grady mad dogs the Gang. Calvin stands up.
GRADY (CONT’D)
Sit down, son.
Calvin goes for his waistband, but Grady quickdraws a COLT .45 and cocks the hammer.
GRADY (CONT’D)
That’s right, motherfucker. Teacher got a gun.
Calvin slowly sits back down.
GRADY (CONT’D)
Good idea. Now let’s make some money.
Grady throws a BACKPACK to Calvin. Calvin opens the backpack and looks inside to find it packed with CASH.
75.
GRADY (CONT’D)
50 grand. Another 100 on deck if you deliver me 60 ounces of H.F.S. for transpo to TJ. Tell your boss I got interested parties down South could make him very rich. Comprehendo?
Calvin hands the backpack to Pich, who rapidly counts cash.
CALVIN
We’ll get back to you.
GRADY
Get me the product by 6th period
tomorrow or you lose the sale.
Grady backs out, gun in hand.
INT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - EVENING
Jenko and Schmidt stare at the bright orange BOOT on Jenko’s Corvette. Grady slowly idles by in his Superbee.
GRADY
Wonder who called that in?
SCHMIDT
Why are you here?
GRADY
Captain Dicks’ Mom died, thank
Christ. He’s on leave, so I’m in
charge of this bitch now.
SCHMIDT
Where’d you get all that money?
GRADY
Where do you think? I returned all your shit to the mall. By the way, you guys are short two grand.
Jenko whips his Gucci glasses off, enraged.
JENKO
We’re the ones on the hook for that cash! What if we don’t get it back?
GRADY
Grab a napkin and dab your weeping vagina, we’ll get it back. Soon as they give me the shit, we execute a round-up and bring ‘em in.
76.
SCHMIDT
We’ll never catch who’s making it.
He’ll go underground.
CALVIN
Prom is in two days. We take these guys down before another kid dies.
Grady stomps the gas and leaves a cloud of smoke.
INT. SAUSALITO ARMS - NIGHT
Smoke curls from a cigarette in an empty bottle of Wild Turkey. Jenko reaches into a GIGANTOR sized bag of Cool Ranch Doritos. It’s empty. He starts licking the bag, freezes.
JENKO
Oh my sweet and righteous God.
Jenko sits up and reads the ingredients on the bag.
JENKO (CONT’D)
I knew that shit tasted familiar.
Jenko grabs the phone.
INT. THE SCHMIDT HOME, SCHMIDT’S ROOM - NIGHT
Schmidt’s cellphone rings. He picks it up.
MOLLY (O.S.)
Doug? They threatened me.
Static fills the line.
SCHMIDT
I’m calling you from a landline
right now, pick it up.
Schmidt quickly dials his Sports Illustrated Football Phone.
SCHMIDT (CONT’D)
Are you okay? Where are you?
MOLLY (O.S.)
Meet me at Shadow Ranch.
Click.
SCHMIDT
Molly? Molly?
77.
Schmidt quickly re-dials.
INT. DELROY’S ROOM - NIGHT
Delroy grabs his phone, sleepy. His room has NASA wallpaper.
DELROY
Brad? It’s four in the morning.
INTERCUT with Jenko at the Sausalito.
JENKO
Cool Ranch Doritos has a shit-ton
of Sodium Caseinate. It’s what
makes them so goddamn delicious.
DELROY
My God. They could be utilizing
flavored tortilla chips.
Call waiting beeps. Jenko clicks over.
INT. THE SCHMIDT HOME - NIGHT
Schmidt tucks a .45 into his waistband, talks into the phone.
SCHMIDT
Molly’s been threatened, she’s at Shadow Ranch Park. You’re closer than me, go make sure she’s okay and I’ll be there ASAP.
JENKO (O.S.)
Roger that. Hey man, you’re not
gonna believe this but I think I
cracked the formula for the shit.
SCHMIDT
Dude I don’t care, get over there!
Schmidt runs into the hallway.
INT. THE SCHMIDT HOME, HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
Annie stands in the hallway, blocking Schmidt’s passage.
ANNIE
Schmiddy, this is too serious. You call the police before you go.
78.
SCHMIDT
I am the fucking police! Jesus Christ, Mom. Why are you listening to my phone conversations?
ANNIE
I accidently picked up and-
SCHMIDT
BULLSHIT. You are a nightmare. Why do you think I moved out when I was 16? You’ve dedicated your life to making me and Dad miserable. AAAAAH!
David pokes his head into the hallway.
DAVID
It actually doesn’t bother me that much, Schmiddy.
SCHMIDT
Dad, go back in your room. Mom, get out of my way.
Schmidt pushes past Annie, then pauses at the door.
SCHMIDT (CONT’D)
I love you.
Schmidt exits.
EXT. SHADOW RANCH PARK - NIGHT
Schmidt approaches a dimly lit playground to see Jenko and Molly standing face to face on a rusty carousel. Jenko touches Molly’s chin. She looks up into his eyes, smiling.
SCHMIDT
Thanks Brad, I got it from here.
Jenko hops off the carousel and winks at Schmidt as they cross. Schmidt pushes the carousel and hops on opposite Molly. They slowly spin.
MOLLY
Your brother is actually a real
sweetheart.
SCHMIDT
He sure is. Who threatened you?
79.
MOLLY
Some guy with a robot voice called and said “keep your mouth shut or you’re dead, bitch.”
SCHMIDT
Molly. What did Billiam see?
MOLLY
Billiam used to walk around school and meet different groups of kids, just to find out what they were like. He was the most curious person I ever met. He was amazing.
Schmidt pushes the carousel again. They spin faster.
MOLLY (CONT’D)
One day at lunch he was out
exploring and he accidentally
discovered the lab where they make
H.F.S. He got out of there fast,
but he was worried they saw him.
SCHMIDT
The lab is at school? Where?
MOLLY
He never said. He didn’t want to
put me in danger. They made him
overdose, I know it.
SCHMIDT
I promise you I’ll take care of whoever did that. But you have to stay home for the rest of the year.
Tears finally escape Molly’s eyes.
MOLLY
No! I’m not missing the performance. It was too important to Billiam. And Prom is Saturday, I’m going with friends, I’m not missing my Prom.
SCHMIDT
You won’t care about any of that
shit in four years.
MOLLY
Who are you to say that?
The carousel slowly comes to a stop.
80.
SCHMIDT
Will you at least go to Prom with
me so I know you’re safe?
MOLLY
I’d love to.
Molly kisses Schmidt on the cheek. He lets it linger.
SCHMIDT
Can you hide out at a friend’s
house after school?
MOLLY
Yeah.
SCHMIDT
Do that.
EXT. VALLEY HIGH - CONTINUOUS
Schmidt and Jenko use wirecutters to cut a hole in the fence.
INT. VALLEY HIGH, HALLWAY - NIGHT
Schmidt loiters in the hallway, crowbar in hand. Jenko exits Principal Whiteman’s office, zips up his pants.
SCHMIDT
What did you just do in there?
JENKO
You don’t want to know.
INT. VALLEY HIGH, LONG HALLWAY - NIGHT
Schmidt uses the crowbar to pry open door after door. Jenko shines a flashlight into each room. They arrive at the last door, labelled: “SPECIAL EDUCATION”.
SCHMIDT
Have you ever seen a differently-
abled kid at this school?
JENKO
Negative.
Schmidt leans on the crowbar and SNAPS the door open. Jenko shines a flashlight in: the room is stacked floor to ceiling with boxes of COOL RANCH DORITOS.
81.
INT. VALLEY HIGH, GYM - NIGHT
Schmidt and Jenko enter the cavernous GYM, dominated by a tortuous obstacle course.
SCHMIDT
I’m so glad we didn’t have P.E.
They slowly move through the obstacles, flashlights scanning.
INT. VALLEY HIGH, BOY’S LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT
Schmidt and Jenko search the BOYS LOCKER ROOM. They step into empty showers and stand on the large drain grate, stumped.
SCHMIDT
You think she’s lying?
JENKO
Nah, man. She’s a good girl.
Schmidt looks at Jenko. An ALARM goes off. They run.
INT. CANDACE CAMERON AUDITORIUM - DAY
The bell rings. Schmidt paces backstage in full Shakespearean dress, nervous. Molly stands with him, also in costume.
SCHMIDT
I’m freaking out. I haven’t been on a stage in a long time. I mean, ever.
Molly hugs Schmidt.
MOLLY
You’ll be amazing. I’m glad we
waited until the performance to
kiss. It makes it more real.
Schmidt sweats beneath his fake beard.
INT. SCIENCE CLASSROOM - DAY
A colorful banner reads “7TH ANNUAL SCIENCE RODEO”. Jenko and Team Bronco watch the cockroaches DEVOUR doses of H.F.S.
DELROY
Dusting them with pulverized Cool
Ranch Doritos makes it addictive.
82.
GUS
My man, you are a genius.
Team Bronco claps Jenko on the back. Mr. Marcenholt takes a look inside the Experiment Arena, nods approvingly.
INT. CANDACE CAMERON AUDITORIUM - DAY
Schmidt walks downstage right and speaks to a full house.
SCHMIDT
The pound of flesh which I demand of him is dearly bought, ‘tis mine and I will have it: If you deny me, fie upon your law!
The curtains close. The crowd breaks into applause. Schmidt soaks it in before walking offstage.
INT. SCIENCE CLASSROOM - DAY
Team Bronco sit with their heads in their hands as Mr.
Marcenholt awards the GOLDEN STETSON to Bryan and Team Bull.
DELROY
I don’t understand what went wrong.
Gus hands Jenko a piece of paper with scrawled equations.
GUS
This might explain it. Did you even double check your work?
Colin Farrell crawls up Jenko’s arm.
JENKO
I mean... not really.
Mr. Marcenholt peers into the Experiment Arena.
MR. MARCENHOLT
Maybe you should have titled the
experiment “How to Kill Bugs”.
DELROY
I can’t believe we trusted you with our academic futures.
JENKO
I’m sorry you guys.
83.
Jenko’s RINGTONE blares. He sets Colin in the Experiment Arena and heads for the door. Bryan tilts his Golden Stetson.
BRYAN
Have fun working at Chili’s for the rest of your life.
Jenko exits, head hung low. A moment later he comes back in and shoves Bryan, stealing the Golden Stetson.
INT. CANDACE CAMERON AUDITORIUM, BACKSTAGE - DAY
Molly and Schmidt stand offstage, waiting for their cue.
MOLLY
Billiam would be really happy with your performance.
SCHMIDT
Thanks, Molly.
MOLLY
Last scene. Are you ready to kill?
SCHMIDT
I was born ready.
A sharp whistle draws Schmidt’s attention. GRADY stands at the backstage door, beckoning Schmidt over.
SCHMIDT (CONT’D)
Be right back.
MOLLY
We’re almost on.
Schmidt jogs over to Grady, who for some reason is holding a DORA THE EXPLORER PINATA.
GRADY
Let’s go. Now.
SCHMIDT
Dude, I gotta finish this play.
GRADY
Are you fuckin’ kidding me? Is
there pressing police business on
that stage?
Schmidt looks over at Molly, who waves him over, panicked.
84.
SCHMIDT
I’m not letting the class down.
GRADY
Oh, okay, no problem. Sorry I
bothered you, see you later.
Grady BRUTALLY yanks Schmidt through the backstage door.
EXT. CANDACE CAMERON AUDITORIUM - CONTINUOUS
Grady slams Schmidt against a dumpster, holds Dora The Explorer up to his face.
GRADY
Do you know what’s inside of this
pinata? 60 ounces of Holy Fuckin’
Shit. Everything I need to arrest
the Gang and bring them in.
SCHMIDT
You just gave them 150 grand?
GRADY
Get your head out of your asshole, of course I didn’t. I told them they’d get it tonight at the party.
SCHMIDT
What party?
Grady holds up a NEON PINK FLYER for a FREE BEER PARTY!
GRADY
This party. I been dropping these over the school. We do the round-up there tonight.
SCHMIDT
Isn’t it extremely dangerous having kids around during the round-up?
GRADY
No shitweed, it puts the bad guys
at ease. Makes violence less
likely. Let’s go, I want to sell
this pinata to a Mexican.
SCHMIDT
You’re actually gonna sell that shit?
85.
GRADY
Gonna use it to arrest a little
pain in the ass I been undercover
on for a year. Big day for me.
SCHMIDT
Congratulations.
Schmidt moves for the Auditorium door. Grady throws him against the dumpster again.
GRADY
You’re my back-up, asshole. Let’s go.
SCHMIDT
Can at least change?
GRADY
Absolutely not.
INT. SUPERBEE - MOMENTS LATER
Schmidt and Jenko sit in the back of the Superbee, wearing Shakespearean costume and lab coat with Golden Stetson.
Grady cracks a Colt .45 and takes a big gulp.
GRADY
This guy is hardcore. When I get out of the car, stand behind me and try not to look like a cop.
Grady burps, dials his cellphone.
GRADY (CONT’D)
Whatup J.C. Yeah, I got the shit. Straight from the Valley Boys. Yeah man, 60 ounces, like I said, shit we doin’ this or not?
Grady hangs up.
GRADY (CONT’D)
Soon as he hands me the cash, take him down. You guys look super weird, that should distract him from his gun momentarily.
Grady pulls a COLT .45 from under his seat, chambers a round.
GRADY (CONT’D)
Anything kicks off, let Officer Boo-
Yah handle it.
86.
SCHMIDT
You named your gun “Officer Boo-Yah”?
EXT. EAST L.A. HIGH - CONTINUOUS
The ‘Bee drives through a sketchy East L.A. neighborhood.
The ‘Bee rolls past the BROKEN TAILLIGHT of an IMPALA. The driver wears a Falcon’s jersey with “R.MEXICO" on the back.
Doors open. Grady, Jenko and Schmidt exit the ‘Bee and come face to face with JESUS CRISTO, who holds a black duffel bag. He recognizes Schmidt and Jenko instantly.
JESUS CRISTO
Jesus Cristo.
Jesus pulls a .38 and FIRES TWICE, blowing out a window on the 'Bee. Grady drops the Pinata. Jesus snatches it, jumps in his Impala and peels out.
GRADY
Motherfucker shot the ‘Bee.
Grady pulls Officer Boo-Yah and SHOOTS at the escaping Impala.
SCHMIDT
That kid knows we're cops!
Everyone stares at each other for a beat.

The Impala skids sideways through an intersection. The 'Bee follows. The Impala races into an ALLEY. The ‘Bee races around the block and enters from the opposite side.
87.
INT. SUPERBEE - CONTINUOUS
Grady SLAMS THE BRAKES. The 'Bee screeches to a stop 10 feet away from the parked Impala, where THREE HUGE MEXICAN BANGERS are getting into the car. One lifts an AK-47 and FIRES.
Glass showers Grady, Jenko and Schmidt as they duck down.
Grady throws the 'Bee into reverse and PUNCHES IT.
The 'Bee races BACKWARDS out of the alley and straight up a LONG FREEWAY ONRAMP. The Impala follows, in hot pursuit.
EXT. EAST L.A. ONRAMP - CONTINUOUS
The Bangers in the Impala OPEN FIRE. Jenko and Schmidt RETURN FIRE through the Bee's blown out windshield.
GRADY
Hang onto your vaginas.
Grady yanks the e-brake, throwing the 'Bee into a laid out 180 slide across the freeway. They straighten out perfectly in the fast lane. Grady smokes the tires in third.
INT. SUPERBEE - CONTINUOUS
Grady cackles into the rearview mirror.
GRADY
Adios, muchachos.
SCHMIDT/JENKO
STOP!
Grady looks down to see A WALL OF STOPPED CARS ahead. He locks the brakes and skids to a stop, inches behind a Kia.
GRADY
Fuck you, traffic!
Suddenly, SCREECHING TIRES. Jenko and Schmidt turn around to see the Impala skidding towards them, too fast.
EXT. 10 FREEWAY - CONTINUOUS
BLAM! The Impala smashes into the 'Bee. The Gangbanger riding shotgun flies through the windshield.
88.

Jesus and two Gangbangers stagger out of the Impala.
GRADY
L.A.P.D! Drop your fuckin'-
The Gangbangers OPEN FIRE WITH AK's, strafing the 18 WHEELER next to Grady, Schmidt and Jenko. They dive under the truck and crawl into the next lane of traffic.
GRADY (CONT’D)
Run run run run run!
Schmidt, Grady and Jenko sprint down an aisle of stopped cars. Bullets whiz by as they leap into a MINIVAN.
INT. MINIVAN - CONTINUOUS
Schmidt races the Minivan through dense traffic, brakes hard on the shoulder and lets out an OLD KOREAN WOMAN.
SCHMIDT
Sorry.
Gunfire EXPLODES the rear window of the Minivan.
GRADY
DRIVE!
Schmidt STOMPS it and races down the shoulder. Traffic clears.
He pulls back onto the freeway and checks the rearview.
SCHMIDT
Shit.
Another MINIVAN pulls next to them, driven by Jesus. The side door slides open and two Gangbangers raise their guns.
Grady SHOOTS their front tire out as Schmidt SLAMS the brakes to avoid another WALL OF TRAFFIC.
89.
Jesus’ Minivan swerves and FLIPS OVER FIVE TIMES, landing upside down on the back of a stopped SEMI CAB.
JENKO
That was basically awesome.
EXT. 10 FREEWAY - CONTINUOUS
A Gangbanger lies dead on the pavement. Schmidt, Jenko and Grady step over him and continue towards the flipped Minivan on the Semi hitch. GUNFIRE erupts from the rear window.
Grady takes cover behind a station wagon full of kids and unloads Officer Boo-Yah.
The Minivan’s gas tank ignites and EXPLODES. Flaming hundred dollar bills float through the air.
JESUS falls out of the Minivan, on fire. He rolls around, clutching THE PINATA. Grady fires a warning shot.
GRADY
Stay down, Jesus!
Jesus stands up and PUNCHES a passing motorcyclist off his '87 KAWASAKI NINJA. He slings the Pinata over his shoulder, leaps on the Ninja and races away.
The TRUCK DRIVER steps out of the SEMI and looks at the flaming Minivan on his hitch. He notices Schmidt and Jenko, in Shakespearean garb and lab coat.
TRUCK DRIVER
What in the fuck?
Grady grabs the Truck Driver by his overalls.
GRADY
Gimme your keys!

The Semi hauls down the freeway, chasing Jesus on the Ninja. Jesus SWERVES to the right, racing down an OFFRAMP. The Semi Cab SWERVES to follow, but loses control.
EXT. OFFRAMP - CONTINUOUS
The Semi screeches sideways down the offramp. The Minivan falls off the hitch and rolls behind it. The Semi knocks a traffic light over and comes to rest on a STREET DIVIDER.
A HOMELESS MAN with a “Will Work for Pussy” sign watches the minivan roll by. Grady flips him a quarter and STOMPS the gas.
INT. SEMI CAB - CONTINUOUS
The Semi speeds down the divider, smashing street signs and keeping pace as the nimble Ninja weaves through cars.
GRADY
GTA Jump Street, motherfuckers.
INT. MACARTHUR PARK - CONTINUOUS

Chinga tu madre!
AIR HORN! The Vendor DIVES as the Semi CRUSHES his cart.

Shouldn't have shot the 'Bee.
BLAM!BLAM!BLAM! Bullets punch through the floor of the cab, narrowly missing the guys.
EXT. EAST L.A. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS
Jesus crawls out from under the Semi, still holding Dora the Explorer. He runs, firing his .38 behind him till it's empty.
Jenko TACKLES Jesus. Dora The Explorer’s head breaks off and spills H.F.S. PACKETS everywhere.
JENKO
You're under arrest!
JESUS CRISTO
I’ma tell those Valley Boys! I’ma
laugh when you get shot!
GRADY
Yeah try that from your isolation cell, lemme know how it works out.
INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - EVENING
Grady, Schmidt and Jenko observe Jesus through a one-way mirror. He sits handcuffed to a table, mad dogging them. He makes a gun with his fingers, shoots it at the mirror.
SCHMIDT
Billiam told Molly the lab is hidden on campus. It’s stupid to do the round-up before we I.D. the supplier.
A sleepy Latino L.A. SHERIFF’S DEPUTY yawns behind Schmidt.
JENKO
Remember how Captain wants to put the LAPD’s big African American dick up his ass?
92.
GRADY
Listen assholes, I haven’t been to a good high school party in seven years. My eyes need to see some teen titty and ass that isn’t my daughter’s. Party. Tonight. That’s an order.
Jenko stares at Jesus through the glass.
JENKO
You told Jesus we were from Valley. What if he figures out a way to get word to the Gang?
GRADY
No way can this punk ass taquito
leak information, this place is
tighter than Mother Mary’s cooch.
The Sheriff’s Deputy (who has a Virgin Mary forearm tattoo) exits the observation room. Moments later he enters the interrogation room and takes Jesus into custody.
INT. L.A. COUNTY JAIL - CONTINUOUS
The Deputy escorts Jesus into an isolation cell and shuts the door. He takes off the cuffs. They exchange a complex handshake and embrace. We hear the sound of a big fart.
INT. BOY'S BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
Zack sits in a stall, legs dangling. He swallows Skittles like pills with Red Bull. The door opens. Footsteps. Zack lifts his feet as SHEA checks beneath the stall.
CALVIN (O.S.)
Brascoes. All three. Big man says
send a message.
SHEA (O.S.)
I’ll call Pooky and Dig-Dug.
Zack slowly pulls his pants up and reaches for his pocket.
CALVIN (O.S.)
One more thing. The bitch knows
about the lab.
Zack drops a single Skittle on the floor. It echoes like a sonic boom. Footsteps approach. Zack ducks into the next stall. BOOM! Calvin kicks the door open.
93.
Zack opens a different door and RUNS. Shea looks to Calvin.
CALVIN (CONT’D)
Cut him in half.
INT. VALLEY HIGH HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
Zack runs down an endlessly long hallway. Shea gains with terrifying speed, knife in his hand. He reaches out... 
Zack stops, spins and shocks Shea with the PEN SIZE STUN GUN. Shea goes down, head bouncing off linoleum. He shakes it off and looks up and down the endless hallway. Zack is gone.
INT. JUMP STREET WINNEBAGO - NIGHT
Jackson racks his shotgun. Harry Truman Jr. locks and loads his AR-15. Lucy velcros her Kevlar vest. They are squeezed into the back of a small Winnebago.
GRADY
These guys are not children. They’ll definitely be armed. They think I’ll be in there with a 100 grand.
Grady points to a corkboard with several senior year photos of Calvin, Shea, Salvador, Boris and Pich.
GRADY (CONT’D)
You see them approach the house,
vibrate our nuts.
Grady points to the old PAGER on his belt. Schmidt and Jenko clip on similar pagers, dressed as “Doug” and “Brad”.
GRADY (CONT’D)
We get the signal, we bust out the front door guns up. Jackson, Luce, Hair of the Dog, you hit ‘em from behind. They’re down before they get in the party.
Grady slams a clip in Officer Boo-Yah and sprays himself with Cool Water. Jenko peeks out the window.
JENKO
Who’s house is this?
GRADY
Captain Dicks.
94.
SCHMIDT
Dude, is it a good idea to get a
bunch of minors shitfaced at a
Police Captain’s house?
Grady cracks a can of Colt .45, takes a deep pull.
GRADY
Calm down, I put O’Douls in the keg, it’s not like we’re getting kids drunk. Although they will act drunk since teenagers are retarded.
Grady let’s loose a tremendous belch.
GRADY (CONT’D)
Before you question the judgement of your Commanding Officer, keep in mind I’m about to make Lieutenant off this case. Whereas once Dep Chief reads my report, you two will be humping Segways and writing jawalking tickets at Hollywood and Highland. Nothing will go wrong as long as everyone stays tactical.
Jackson racks his shotgun, tactical.
INT. CAPTAIN DICKS’ HOUSE - NIGHT
Grady dances on a table to POISON, “Unskinny Bop”, surrounded by teen girls, all slamming O’Douls from red plastic cups. Jenko and Schmidt watch, disgusted and jealous.
INT. CAPTAIN DICKS’ HOUSE, KITCHEN - NIGHT
Schmidt and Jenko sit in the breakfast nook, depressed.
JENKO
You think the Captain has a fridge full of 40’s in the garage?
SCHMIDT
Now who’s the racist?
JENKO
I’m just saying, the man has a
taste for large beverages.
95.
INT. CAPTAIN DICKS’ HOUSE, THE GARAGE - NIGHT
Schmidt and Jenko open a refrigerator stocked with 40’s.
INT. CAPTAIN DICKS’ HOUSE, KITCHEN - NIGHT
Back at the table, Schmidt and Jenko clink their 40’s.
JENKO
To Brad and Doug.
They take sips and watch kids down O’Douls and act drunk.
SCHMIDT
Good job on really getting into
character and acting like a dick.
JENKO
That almost sounded annoyed.
SCHMIDT
Not at all. I just appreciate the
fact you took it far enough to
flirt with Molly at the park.
JENKO
Not like either of us were gonna do anything with her. Not like you could’ve anyway.
Schmidt takes a big gulp from his 40.
SCHMIDT
Yeah. Hey, also? Good job on acting dumb enough to fuck up your Science Rodeo experiment. Must have been hard, pretending to be that stupid.
Jenko takes a big gulp from his 40. Schmidt stands up.
SCHMIDT (CONT’D)
I’m takin’ a recon.
JENKO
Don’t hurry back.
INT. CAPTAIN DICKS’ HOUSE - NIGHT
Schmidt wanders around Dicks’ house while kids party. He spots MOLLY, sitting on the floor in a corner, nursing a plastic cup. He sits next to her. She won’t look at him.

MOLLY
If I knew you were here I wouldn’t have come.
SCHMIDT
I thought you were gonna hide out
at a friend’s house after school.
What are you doing here?
MOLLY
Drinking. But something’s wrong
with this beer. It’s not working.
Schmidt smiles and shakes his head, in love.
SCHMIDT
Molly, I have to tell you something.
Molly hands Schmidt her plastic cup and walks away.
INT. JUMP STREET WINNEBAGO - NIGHT
Jackson re-racks his shotgun.
JACKSON FUGAZY
I am so ready to get it on.
LUCY
Check out these two.

INT. CAPTAIN DICKS’ HOUSE, UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
Grady has KAYLEE, a 16 year old girl, cornered in a doorway.
97.

Shit guys, it wasn’t BYOB but fuck it. Let’s party.
Pooky and Dig-Dug stare at Grady in silence. Grady nods.
GRADY (CONT’D)
Riiight, the Gang sent you. They
want the cash. That’s cool, that’s
cool. Let’s go down to my safe.
POOKY
You live here?
GRADY
Yeah, it’s my house.
DIG-DUG
Then who that?
Dig-Dug points to an ENORMOUS PORTRAIT of Captain Dicks and his smiling black family.
GRADY
That’s my brother. My parents
adopted him from Nairobi in 19-
Pooky casually picks up a vase and SMASHES Grady’s face.
INT. CAPTAIN DICKS’ HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Jenko FLIES backwards into the living room and falls onto a glass coffee table, shattering it. He jumps up, squaring off with Schmidt. A huge group of kids circle.
98.
SCHMIDT
Still can’t let me like a girl
without trying to fuck her.
JENKO
You need to calm down, bro. We were just talking.
SCHMIDT
Bullshit. You were feeding her pizza.
JENKO
Grow up, man. We're not in high
school anymore!
The crowd of kids are confused.
JENKO (CONT’D)
Almost.
Molly rushes out of the party and slams the door.
SCHMIDT
You know what, Brad? You’re a fuckin’-
JENKO
Don’t call me a fuckin’ idiot. I’m serious, man.
SCHMIDT
You are a fucking idiot. Just like your Dad. You’re a fuckin’ idiot who tries to make up for it by scamming chicks so you can feel better about yourself.
Jenko takes a slight step backwards. He smiles.
JENKO
You remember that night you came to my house crying like a little bitch because you tried to make out with Melissa Whispitt and she rejected you? I fucked her later that night. I juiced on her back. Twice.
Schmidt PUNCHES Jenko in the face.
INT. DICKS’ HOUSE, MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Schmidt tries to kick Jenko while he’s down, but Jenko grabs his foot and FLIPS him off balance. Schmidt falls on an end table, right on his spine.
SCHMIDT
AAAAARGH!
Pooky and Dig-Dug look at each other, shrug and exit.
EXT. CAPTAIN DICKS’ HOUSE - NIGHT
Molly walks the sidewalk, alone. A TAURUS STATION WAGON with tinted windows and a D.A.D. bumper sticker slowly rolls up.
CALVIN (O.S.)
Hey girl. Need a ride?
100.
INT. CAPTAIN DICKS’ HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

INT. JUMP STREET WINNEBAGO - CONTINUOUS
Jackson, Harry and Lucy watch Jenko and Schmidt CRASH through the window and land in Dicks’ front yard.
LUCY
Um... 
The Ford Taurus slowly cruises by the house. BORIS leans out the passenger window and HURLS a Molotov cocktail.
Jenko and Schmidt watch the flaming bottle sail over their heads and through the Master Bedroom window.
FA-FOOMF! Flames EXPLODE from the Master Bedroom. Jackson KICKS the ‘Bago door open, leaps out and drops his shotgun.
JACKSON FUGAZY
Shit!
Harry opens fire on the Taurus as it races away, putting a bullet in the “A” of the D.A.D. bumper sticker. Kids RUN out of the house, jumping over Schmidt and Jenko.
SCHMIDT/JENKO
Grady.
Schmidt and Jenko leap back through the broken window.
EXT. DICKS' HOUSE - NIGHT
HELICOPTER SHOT: Jenko and Schmidt drag a burning Grady onto the front lawn. Dicks' house burns down behind them. Soot covers their faces. They yell "Man down! Man down!"
INT. INTENSIVE CARE UNIT - NIGHT
Grady lies in a coma, completely wrapped in moist bandages. A ventilator hisses. Jenko and Schmidt stand at his bedside.
CAPTAIN DICKS stands on the other side of the bed.
CAPTAIN DICKS
I don’t say this as Angry Black
Captain.
(MORE)
101.
CAPTAIN DICKS (CONT'D)
I say this from the calmest place in my heart, because only a calm man can speak his mind clearly. I want your buns and gadges before you leave this building, and then I want you to die.
Captain Dicks turns to exit, then pauses.
CAPTAIN DICKS (CONT’D)
You endangered children.
Captain Dicks exits. The ventilator hisses.
Blackberries go off simultaneously. Schmidt and Jenko both click "RECEIVE". Identical MMS videos begin off sync, creating a haunting echo delay.
SPLIT SCREEN OF BOTH VIDEOS: A man in a BLACK GAS MASK looks into lense. His voice is electronically deepened.
HOODED MAN
We have your friend.
The man steps aside, revealing MOLLY tightly bound to a chair, lit by a bright floodlight.
HOODED MAN (CONT’D)
You two are due for a visit to the Principal’s office. Tonight. During Prom. Bring the Pinata. If you call off the dance, I will kill her. If you bring other cops, I will kill her. She’s already had several doses and seems to be enjoying it.
Molly’s head lolls from side to side in the background.
END OF MESSAGE
Jenko and Schmidt slip their Blackberries in their pockets.
INT. EVIDENCE ROOM - NIGHT
Jenko chats up HOLLY, officer in charge of the Evidence Room.

INT. THE TOPANGA MALL, PENGUINO TUXEDO - DAY
Jenko and Schmidt wait at the “Penguino Tuxedo” counter.
102.
JENKO
I'm sorry I fucked Melissa.
SCHMIDT
I don't want to talk about it.
The PENGUINO REP slides two long black boxes over the counter.
PENGUINO REP
Two Gunsteel Blue six-button longcoat tuxedos with accoutrement. Still can't say I agree with wearing a cummerbund under a waistcoat.
SCHMIDT
We like layers.
A drumbeat of locking and loading weapons kicks in:
INT. THE SAUSALITO ARMS - EVENING
TIGHT ON THE YEARBOOK: opened to the self-captioned photo of
teen Jenko and Schmidt: "MOST LIKELY TO KICK ASS!!!"
PULL BACK TO REVEAL the yearbook resting between two GUNSTEEL BLUE TUXEDOS, laid out on either side of the couch.
PULL BACK TO REVEAL Jenko and Schmidt oiling and loading SEVERAL HANDGUNS and a PISTOL GRIP SAWED-OFF SHOTGUN.
QUICK CUTS: Fingers slide rounds into clips, button tuxedo shirts over body armor. Tactical knives sheathed behind shiny belts. Cufflinks and handcuffs. Clips slam into Sig Sauer P220’s. A .38 tucked behind a cummerbund. A shoulder holster strapped under a waistcoat. Fingers button up longcoats.
Schmidt finishes his bow tie in the bathroom mirror. He looks at Jenko, who struggles to pin a corsage to himself.
SCHMIDT
Here.
Schmidt pins the corsage to Jenko’s coat.
JENKO
Thanks.
They stand face to face for an awkward moment.
SCHMIDT
Will you go to Prom with me?
103.
JENKO
I guess.
They turn to the mirror and admire matching tuxedo glory.
SCHMIDT/JENKO
Damn.
QUEENS OF THE STONE AGE, "Feel Good Hit of the Summer" over:
EXT. VALLEY HIGH - NIGHT
A 1990 stretch Lincoln Continental limo jumps the curb in front of Valley High School and SMASHES through the gate, sliding to a stop in front of the Auditorium doors.
A TUXEDOED STRAGGLER sitting on a planter drops his cigarette. The limo doors open. Schmidt and Jenko step out.
They march towards the Tuxedoed Straggler with a look of cold determination. He instinctively backs away.
JENKO
Get in the fuckin’ Prom.
SCHMIDT
Now.
The Tuxedoed Straggler RUNS into the Prom, throwing the doors open. Music spills out. Schmidt watches carefree kids having the time of their lives. The door slowly closes... 
SCHMIDT (CONT’D)
Let’s do this.
Jenko pulls a HEAVY CHAIN from the trunk and loops it through the Auditorium door, locking it with a big PADLOCK.
Schmidt pulls the Dora the Explorer pinata from the trunk. Her head is duct-taped on backwards. He cradles her like a baby.
Jenko lights one of the Tuxedoed Straggler’s cigarettes, offers one to Schmidt. They eye the eerily quiet campus. A crumpled Shark Attack Weekly blows by like a tumbleweed.
They slowly unbutton their six-button longcoats.
JENKO
"He had, of course, dreamed of battles all his life - of vague and bloody conflicts that had thrilled him with their sweep and fire."
104.
SCHMIDT
What is that?
JENKO
Red Badge of Courage. Book report.
SCHMIDT
Maybe you actually learned something at this school.
JENKO
Maybe we both did.
Schmidt and Jenko head for school.
INT. VALLEY HIGH, HALLWAY - NIGHT
We TRACK with Schmidt and Jenko down a hallway, past a bright blue D.A.D. banner on the wall. They stop at their lockers, but camera continues tracking to the PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE.
Offscreen, the two lockers slam shut. Schmidt and Jenko re-enter frame, standing in front of the Principal’s Office.
The bell rings.
JENKO
Final exam, bitch.
SCHMIDT
Just observe my natural theatrical ability and follow my lead.
Schmidt opens the door and steps into the Principal’s Office.
INT. PRINCIPAL WHITEMAN’S OUTER OFFICE - NIGHT
Schmidt and Jenko walk through the outer office and approach Whiteman’s private office. They slowly open the door... 
INT. PRINCIPAL WHITEMAN’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
WALT sits at Principal Whiteman’s desk, resplendent in a white tuxedo, sitting behind a huge pile of H.F.S. packets.
SCHMIDT/JENKO
Holy fucking shit.
Walt pops an H.F.S. wafer into his mouth.
105.
WALT
Indeed.
Walt reveals a RIFLE perched on his knee, barrel pointed at Schmidt and Jenko.
WALT (CONT’D)
Calvin?
Calvin appears behind Schmidt and Jenko and pats them down.
CALVIN
Clean.
WALT
Go give Molly her final snack.
Calvin leers at Schmidt and exits.
SCHMIDT
You don’t get the Pinata until I
get the girl.
Walt slowly crunches into another H.F.S. wafer. He walks up to Schmidt, placing the rifle barrel under his chin.
WALT
I don’t need the Pinata, asshole. I just wanted to see the look on your face when you knew it was me.
SCHMIDT
Happy?
WALT
Yes. I like to look at my shit
before I flush it.
JENKO
That’s pretty weird, man.
SCHMIDT
Do you also like to talk to it?
Walt gives Schmidt a kiss on the cheek.
WALT
You can’t harsh my mellow, man.
Don’t even try.
They watch Walt back out the door with a beatific smile.
106.
WALT (CONT’D)
Milt? Time to earn that second
Porsche. Do it quietly.
Walt closes the door. Schmidt and Jenko turn back around to see PRINCIPAL WHITEMAN sitting at his desk, aiming a .44 Magnum and smiling his yellow-toothed smile.
PRINCIPAL WHITEMAN
Have a seat.
Schmidt and Jenko sit. Dora rides on Schmidt’s knee.
PRINCIPAL WHITEMAN (CONT’D) I’m afraid this time I’ll have to expel you boys.
Whiteman screws a big SILENCER onto the revolver.
SCHMIDT
Just so I can be extra pissed off before I die, where the fuck is the lab? We looked everywhere.
PRINCIPAL WHITEMAN Did you look in the boiler room beneath the showers? I’d love to see you try to get there tonight. We’ve got a ton of staff on and they all have a juvenile fascination with automatic weapons.
Whiteman cocks the hammer on the .44 Magnum.
PRINCIPAL WHITEMAN (CONT’D) Exciting night. Walt’s making a big sales push. We’re pulling down huge margins.
SCHMIDT
Dude, why work at a school if all you want is money? Why mess with kids?
Principal Whiteman smiles, wistful.
PRINCIPAL WHITEMAN There was a time I wanted to help the youth of America. Then I got to know them. Say, which one of you took a shit on my desk?
Jenko raises a finger.
107.
JENKO
Yo.
PFT! Whiteman shoots. Jenko flies backwards out of his chair.
Whiteman aims at Schmidt.
BOOM! Dora’s head and Whiteman’s head explode simultaneously.
Blood sprays Whiteman’s MASTER OF EDUCATION degree.
Smoke pours from the SAWED OFF SHOTGUN inside the pinata.
JENKO (O.S.) (CONT’D)
I can’t breathhhe.
Schmidt lifts Jenko into his seat. Jenko gasps a few times.
He inspects the huge hole in his shirt, Kevlar beneath.
JENKO (CONT’D)
So much for the Tux deposit.
He notices Whiteman’s headless body.
JENKO (CONT’D)
Jesus, what did you load that thing with?
SCHMIDT
A big fuckin’ bullet.
Schmidt rips the pinata off the shotty and pumps it.
SCHMIDT (CONT’D)
Molly’s gotta be in the lab.
EXT. VALLEY HIGH, HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
Schmidt and Jenko jog to their lockers. Schmidt opens his, revealing THE ARSENAL. He grabs a Sig P220 and racks one into the chamber. Jenko struggles with his combination.
JENKO
Damn it!
SCHMIDT
Move.
Schmidt SHOOTS the lock off Jenko’s locker. They re-holster their huge arsenal and slowly walk down the hall. Schmidt leads with the shotty, Jenko slightly behind with a .45.
They turn a corner and face a LONG EMPTY HALLWAY.
108.
JENKO
Not a shitload of cover.
They carefully walk down the long hallway, gripping their guns a little tighter. BAM! A door flies open. They aim.
ZACK
It’s me it’s me it’s me!
Zack pathetically holds up his Pen Sized Stun Gun.
SCHMIDT
Fuck, Zack. You almost just got
shot, what are you doing here?
ZACK
I’ve been hiding in this closet since yesterday. They know you’re cops!
JENKO
Wow, it’s like you’re the
reincarnation of Sherlock Holmes.
Zack grabs Jenko by the longcoat.
ZACK
There’s been guys with guns in here all day. Get me out of here. I swear to God I’ll never do drugs again. I’ll never do drugs again God! Just get me out of here.
SCHMIDT
It’s safer for you to stay in the
closet till this is over.
ZACK
No no no. Not without a gun.
JENKO
Forget it.
ZACK
You can’t just leave me here with a pen sized fucking stun gun!
Schmidt pulls a .38 Automatic from a belt holster.
SCHMIDT
Do not use this unless absolutely
necessary.
Jenko throws his hands up in frustration. Schmidt hands Zack the gun. Zack stares at it in awe.
109.
SCHMIDT (CONT’D)
The safety is off, so don’t put any pressure on the-
BLAM! The gun fires into Jenko’s chest. He staggers backwards and hits the wall, sliding down and gasping.
JENKO
Bad judgement. Bad judgement.
Schmidt guides Zack’s hand and points the gun at the ground.
SCHMIDT
Keep your finger off the trigger unless you’re ready to kill someone.
Schmidt helps Jenko up, again. Jenko glares at Zack.
ZACK
What? It was an accident.
AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE strafes the hallway, blasting holes in lockers. SHEA, POOKY and DIG-DUG fire Tec-9’s down the hall.
Schmidt kicks Zack back in the closet and runs into the nearest classroom. Jenko follows, firing on the run.
INT. YEARBOOK CLASS - CONTINUOUS
Schmidt and Jenko take up positions at two classroom doors. The chalkboard reads “GREAT JOB CLASS OF ‘10!!!”
Schmidt holsters the shotty in the longcoat, pulls the .45.
SCHMIDT
You’re in the Yearbook. You got voted most likely to be a huge dick.
JENKO
You got voted most likely to eat one.
They KICK the doors open and step out firing.
INT. VALLEY HIGH, LONG HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
A furious exchange of gunfire. Jenko shoots Dig-Dug and Pooky. Schmidt places shots in Shea’s lower torso.
Schmidt and Jenko run up, guns trained. Pooky and Dig-Dug are dead. Shea writhes on the ground.
110.
SHEA
This ain’t happening. I got a life. I got a daughter. I’m a human being with a story, it can’t end like this.
Schmidt and Jenko drop clips and reload.
SCHMIDT
If you want to avoid getting killed by me, here’s two easy ways to do it. One, don’t sell drugs to kids. Two, don’t fire a Tec-9 at my face.
SHEA
Man fuck you.
Shea dies. Schmidt and Jenko continue down the hall, guns up.
SCHMIDT
That’s kind of bullshit.
JENKO
What’s kind of bullshit?
They slide against the wall, taking cover on a blind corner.
SCHMIDT
He says “fuck you” and then he dies?
It’s like the ultimate last word.
Fuck him.
Jenko peeks around the corner. PICH and THREE CAMBODIAN GUNMEN open fire with AK-47’s. Jenko ducks back as the corner DISINTEGRATES in a hail of bullets.
Schmidt and Jenko run back down the hall and take positions in doorwells. The Gunmen round the corner and fire. Trophy Cases explode. School banners are shredded.
Schmidt and Jenko leap into different classrooms.
INT. GRAPHIC ARTS ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Schmidt slowly steps backwards past a huge PAPERCUTTER. He shifts gunsights from door to door, waiting.
Pich crawls in the window behind Schmidt, knife in hand. He FLICKS the knife, sinking it into Schmidt’s right shoulder.
Schmidt drops his .45 and spins around to see Pich running at him with huge gleaming knives in either hand.
111.
Schmidt picks up a YARDSTICK and WHIPS IT at Pich, slashing his eye. Pich drops a knife and clutches his face. He charges Schmidt with the other knife.
Schmidt evades, grabs Pich’s attacking hand, pins it under the papercutter and throws his weight on the blade. SHHHUNK.
PICH
AIIIEEEEEE!
Pich screams at his handless stump and collapses.
SCHMIDT
I’m sick of getting stabbed, goddamnit.
Schmidt pulls the throwing knife out of his shoulder and unholsters the pistol grip pump. He kicks the door open.

Live free, brother.
The cockroach crawls away. Schmidt and Jenko exit the room.

They swap positions. Jenko fires his .45 while Schmidt reloads the shotty.
JENKO
Switch!
They swap. Schmidt fires the shotgun. Bullets spray the door.
SCHMIDT
There’s too many!
Jenko steps back to reload. CRUNCH. He looks down to see the squashed body of Colin Farrell.
JENKO
You motherfuckers.
Jenko whips off his longcoat and lays it flat on a lab station. He kicks open the CHEMICAL STORAGE CLOSET.

Methyl Nitrate, Nitric Acid... 
Jenko grabs several large glass containers.
INT. VALLEY HIGH, SCIENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

in hot!
Jenko folds the longcoat around glass chemical containers.
JENKO
Open the door!
SLOW MOTION: Schmidt yanks the door open and moves aside as Jenko HURLS the coat-wrapped chem-bomb into the hallway and DIVES behind a lab table.
BA-BOOM! Both classroom doors blow off their hinges. Orange fireballs BELCH into the room, then quickly vaporize.
Jenko peeks up from behind a charred lab station. Schmidt stands between the charred doorways, wide-eyed.
113.
JENKO (CONT’D)
Bitchin’.
Boris, engulfed in flames, runs into the room shooting rounds from a burning Uzi. Jenko and Schmidt blow him away.
INT. VALLEY HIGH, HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
Jenko and Schmidt walk the hallway, silhouetted by sprinkler rain. Schmidt picks up an AK-47 with banana clip.
SCHMIDT
Time to go "Last of the Mohicans"
up in this motherfucker.
JENKO
Why does Daniel Day-Lewis make your butt pussy so wet?
SCHMIDT
I don’t know, he just does.
SALVADOR quietly steps out of a classroom behind Schmidt and Jenko. He raises a .50 caliber Desert Eagle. BLAM BLAM BLAM!
Jenko and Schmidt whip around. Salvador crumples to the ground, revealing ZACK holding Schmidt’s .38 auto.
JENKO
Thanks.
SCHMIDT
Now get out of here. And get into
drug treatment.
ZACK
I don’t need treatment. I just killed a man. Drugs will never get me as high as I am at this exact moment.
Zack runs down the hall, escaping. Schmidt and Jenko KICK open the doors to the gym.

They head for the locker room.
INT. BOY’S LOCKER ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Jenko and Schmidt enter steaming showers, but the steam isn’t coming from water... it’s coming up from the shower grate. They lift the grate and descend into the mist.
INT. THE BOILER ROOM - CONTINUOUS
An angry boiler hisses and steams next to a LARGE SCALE HFS LAB. Schmidt and Jenko drop into the room from a ladder. Two chemists in LAB COATS turn around, shocked to see them.
JENKO
Brilliant, you guys. Using
hypophosphorous acid as a reducing
agent in a poorly ventilated space
next to a boiler that needed replaced
twenty years ago? This place is a
poodle fart away from exploding the
entire gym. Why don't the three of us
head upstairs and talk things over.
CHEMIST #1
There’s four of us you fucking idi-
BLAM! Schmidt shoots a bottle of acid that sprays the chemist in the face. He screams and flails.
SCHMIDT
Nobody calls this guy a fuckin’
idiot but me.
Schmidt aims the gun at the other Chemist’s head
SCHMIDT (CONT’D)
WHERE’S THE GIRL?
115.
OTHER LAB COAT GUY
At Prom! At Prom!
The guy with acid on his face collapses onto the table and sends the ENTIRE LAB crashing to the ground!
EXT. THE GYM - NIGHT
Schmidt and Jenko run out of the gym in SUPER SLOW MOTION. They leap over the DAD-MOBILE, a mangled auto meant to scare kids away from drugged driving.
They land on the other side and brace for an explosion. They wait for a long time. In slow motion. Still waiting. Getting awkward now. They stand up.
JENKO
(super slow mo)
Shit. Guess I was wrong.
End slow motion as the windshield of the DAD-mobile BLOWS OUT.
Schmidt and Jenko spot WALT on the Auditorium roof, aiming his rifle. They take cover on the other side of the DAD-mobile.
JENKO (CONT’D)
I’m empty. What do you got?
SCHMIDT
Six in the revolver.
Sirens wail in the distance.
JENKO
Do we wait for backup?
SCHMIDT
Calvin’s in there with her right now.
Jenko takes a deep breath and nods to himself.
JENKO
The cheetah chases pussy at noon.
SCHMIDT
Dude... that’s a drastic option.
JENKO
Does it make us even for Melissa?
SCHMIDT
Affirmative.
116.
JENKO
Just don’t miss.
SLOW MOTION: Jenko SPRINTS across the quad. Walt tracks with the rifle. Schmidt draws a .38 revolver from behind his cummerbund, steps out and fires 5 times... missing!

Schmidt and Jenko run to the Auditorium.
INT. CANDACE CAMERON AUDITORIUM - CONTINUOUS
Jenko and Schmidt enter the Prom. Music EXPLODES. A banner reads “UNMASK THE NIGHT”. Kids wear Costume Ball masks and get down on the packed dance floor in front of the stage.
JENKO
You find Molly, I’ll find Walt.
They split off. Jenko approaches the stage. DEAN STANTON steps in front of him, rolling his sleeves up.
DEAN STANTON
You think I don’t know it was you and your brother messing with me? You and your pals ruined my school. Time something got done about it.
JENKO
Look, we’re both good guys. I’m LAPD.
DEAN STANTON
Sure you are.
Jenko sighs and slips off his waistcoat.
DEAN STANTON (CONT’D)
I trained hand to hand in ‘Nam,
punk. Where’d you train?
JENKO
Echo Park.
Jenko kicks Stanton in the balls and applies a chokehold on him till he passes out.
INT. CANDACE CAMERON AUDITORIUM, DANCEFLOOR - CONTINUOUS
Schmidt sees CALVIN AND MOLLY slow dancing beneath the huge mirrorball. Molly is very obviously on the shit.
117.
Calvin sees Schmidt and slowly pulls back his Tuxedo coat to reveal the .357 MAGNUM. Schmidt checks the cylinder on his gun. Empty. Calvin holds up an OVERSIZED H.F.S. WAFER.
SCHMIDT
No... 
Calvin teases Molly with the wafer. She sticks her tongue out like it’s communion. Schmidt drops his gun and runs towards them. Calvin draws his .357 Magnum.
CALVIN
Urk... 
Calvin spasms and drops the gun. JENKO stands behind him, TACTICAL KNIFE buried in Calvin’s lower back.
JENKO
This is why you don’t bring a gun
to a knife fight.
Jenko uses the knife handle to quietly lead Calvin to a corner table. He sits him in a chair and cuffs him.
JENKO (CONT’D)
Your under arrest.
CALVIN
(weakly)
I need an ambulance.
JENKO
So did Billiam.
TWO REBECCAS take the stage to announce Prom Court.
REBECCA #1
Are you guys pumped for Prom Court?
ENTIRE PROM
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
INT. CANDACE CAMERON AUDITORIUM - CONTINUOUS
Molly spins under the mirrorball, oblivious, dancing with herself. She sees Schmidt and throws her arms around him.
MOLLY
I wish you were here earlier. There was a unicorn made out of rainbow sprinkles.
118.
SCHMIDT
Molly, I have to tell you something.
MOLLY
No, I have to tell you something.
It’s a secret.
Molly whisper in Schmidt’s ear.
MOLLY (CONT’D)
I love you.
Molly slowly, sensually moves in for a kiss. Schmidt stops her just before their lips touch.
SCHMIDT
Molly, I’m a police officer.
MOLLY
Shut up, silly.
SCHMIDT
My name is Schmidt. I’m an
undercover cop.
Molly catches her breath.
REBECCA #1 (O.S.)
And the Class of '10 Prom Queen is... 
REBECCA #2 (O.S.)
MOLLY TRACEY OH MY GOD!
The students go crazy. Molly slowly backs away from Schmidt.
MOLLY
You fucking dick.
Tears run down Molly's face. She stumbles up to the stage and is crowned. Jenko appears next to Schmidt.
JENKO
Let’s find the roof access.
INT. BACKSTAGE - NIGHT
Walt drops through a roof hatch and lands hard on the CATWALK above the stage. He stands, using his rifle as a crutch.
SCHMIDT appears one end of the catwalk, aiming an old revolver. JENKO appears at the other end of the catwalk, aiming Calvin’s .357 Magnum. Walt clenches his jaw.
119.
WALT
You were right. I do make drugs sound cool. I come from marketing. It’s my thing.
JENKO
A dead son is no reason to put
other people’s kids at risk.
WALT
I don’t have a dead son, retard. I just love making shitloads of money.
SCHMIDT
It’s over, Walt. Drop the gun.
Walt drops the rifle. Schmidt and Jenko slowly close in.
WALT
H.F.S. surpassed all expectations. I hit every demo. Whites. Blacks. Latinos. Asians. Others. I owned them all.
SCHMIDT
What about the kids who got hurt?
WALT
You guys just spent three weeks in a high school and you still care about the kids? Teenagers are the worst people on the planet. They spend their disposable income on absolute dogshit and fill the world with horrible things. Fallout Boy? Paris Hilton? Twilight? All because of teenagers. FUCK teenagers.
SCHMIDT
You're a bad D.A.D.
WALT
And you're a shitty actor. If you sold the weight of that prop gun a little more, I might not have shot your girlfriend.
Walt SHOOTS a compact 9mm from the hip, hitting Jenko in the vest. Jenko DROPS the .357 off the catwalk.
Walt aims his pistol towards Molly on the stage below. Schmidt GRABS Walt’s gun with one hand and PUNCHES him with the other, splitting his nose in half.
120.
They struggle against the catwalk railing. Walt grips the pistol like a vice, pushing it towards Schmidt, jaw grinding. Schmidt uses his free hand to grab an ELECTRICAL CABLE and wrap it around Walt's neck.
Walt's face turns red and his veins pop as he muscles his gun towards Schmidt’s face.
Schmidt roars with rage and throws Walt off the catwalk.
Walt JERKS at the end of the cable, hanging by the neck. The entire Prom looks up as he shits and pisses his white tuxedo.
After a moment of shocked silence, girls begin to scream. The Auditorium doors are kicked open by S.W.A.T. officers.
SWAT OFFICERS
LAPD!
Swat Officers fan out and evacuate the kids.
INT. VALLEY HIGH, AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
Jenko and Schmidt walk to center stage as police officers clear out the last of the students. Schmidt watches the EMS Technicians wheel Molly out on a gurney.
She weakly lifts up her hand up... and flips him off.
JENKO
Keeping this as a souvenir.
Jenko leans over to pick up Calvin’s .357 Magnum. BANG! A bullet splinters the stage floor. Jenko whirls around to see Walt aiming the pistol with his very last shred of life.
Jenko raises Calvin’s .357 Magnum and FIRES multiple times.
Walt dances like a pinata. Jenko hands the gun to Schmidt.
SUPER TIGHT on Schmidt as he aims.
SCHMIDT
Drugs Are Dangerous, bitch.
BLAM! Schmidt shoots Walt in the heart, blowing a hole in his chest big enough to see through.
EXT. VALLEY HIGH, AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
Jenko and Schmidt sit in the Quad.
121.
SCHMIDT
Do you feel kind of bad about
fucking up the entire school?
Jenko shrugs.
JENKO
We cured the plague.
SCHMIDT
At least the gym didn't blow u-
AN UNNECESSARILY MASSIVE FIREBALL blows up the gym, sending the DAD-MOBILE up into the air. Deadly shrapnel whizzes by Schmidt and Jenko's totally calm faces. DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD - DAY
THE SUN shines brightly on Jenko and Schmidt as they ride Segways down Hollywood Blvd in geeky helmets and shorts that are way too snug. They write up a parking ticket.
SCHMIDT
You think I should call Molly one
of these days? I mean, she'll be
going to college soon.
Jenko slips a ticket under a windshield wiper.
JENKO
Wouldn't do that for a number of
reasons. First of all, it's
immoral. Second, I fucked her.
Schmidt laughs, then stops, suspicious. A lime green SUPERBEE pulls up behind them, engine rumbling.
GRADY
Nice shorts.
Jenko and Schmidt turn to see GRADY, whose entire face is a horrifying mess of pink scar tissue.
SCHMIDT
Jesus.
GRADY
It’s only because I’ve accepted Christ as my Lord and Saviour that I’m able to forgive you for taking his name in vain. Take a long look at this face.
122.
Grady points to his unbelievably grotesque face.
GRADY (CONT’D)
This face is proof that miracles happen. I should be dead, but as I lay there smelling my own skin burn off my face, I called on the Lord and he saved my life. You should invite him into yours, on bent knee and with a contrite heart.
SCHMIDT
Dude. What do you want?
GRADY
Captain wants to see you. I'm gonna drive real slow and make you follow me on those vagina baskets, 'cause that shit is hilarious.
Grady pulls away. Jenko and Schmidt mount their Segways.
EXT. DEPUTY CHIEF HARDY’S OFFICE - DAY
Schmidt and Jenko snack on Snickers. They sit facing Deputy Chief Hardy and Captain Dicks (sipping an X-Treme Gulp).
DEPUTY CHIEF HARDY
You made sure no kids got hurt. When it comes down to it, that's what counts. We got a serious situation at East L.A. High. Riots and violence on a scale you can't possibly imagine. You report for duty at 0600 tomorrow.
SCHMIDT
Where to, sir?
CAPTAIN DICKS
YOU KNOW WHERE TO, MOTHERFUCKER. Don’t be humiliating my unit in front of Deputy Chief. I swear to God and Moses I will literally put my foot in your asshole. I’ll put my whole leg in there, push my toes on the back of your eyeballs make you look like Steve Urkel. Shit in your mouth and seal it with duct tape. I’ll piss in your ear and make you listen to The Beach Boys, you think I’m playing?
The NEW 21 JUMP STREET THEME SONG blasts out as the NEW 21 JUMP STREET GRAFFITI sprays over the screen and credits roll.
