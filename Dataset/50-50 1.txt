EXT. SEATTLE - DAY

It’s an unusually clear winter day as the peaks of Mount Rainier look down on the avenues and harbors of Seattle.

ADAM LERNER (27) jogs through the streets of Seattle. The morning mist envelops the PIER. Adam’s iPod blares in his ear as he passes the FISH MARKET.

Adam arrives at a street corner. Ahead, a “Don’t Walk” sign blinks. So he does. Running in place, Adam looks from side to side. There’s not a car, person or thing in sight this early in the morning. He looks again at the orange hand, urging him to stop.

Another JOGGER runs up behind Adam, and disobeys the crosswalk, running past him and across the street. Adam continues to wait for the light to change.

The light goes green. He crosses.


INT. SHOWER - MOMENTS LATER

Adam tries to squirt shampoo into his hand, but the bottle is empty. He looks over at a large assortment of women’s products, grabs the first one - Fructis by L’Oreal - and squirts some into his hair. He proceeds to lather his entire body in the product.


INT. BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Adam dresses in front of the mirror. His outfit is well put-together. He pulls out a LINT BRUSH and meticulously combs his cardigan. RACHAEL (24), wearing her oversized “KEEP TAHOE BLUE” shirt, enters the bedroom brushing her teeth.

ADAM
So are you staying over tonight?

RACHAEL
Uh...Not sure. There are a couple of gallery openings I want to check out.

Rachael goes through Adam’s drawers looking for something.

RACHAEL (CONT’D)
I’m so nervous about my show. I
still have so much work to do.

(MORE)
 





 

RACHAEL (CONT’D)

I need two more paintings and everything I’ve been coming up with is completely derivative of what I’ve been seeing at the Henry.
(confused)
Where’s my stuff?

ADAM
It’s in your drawer.

RACHAEL
(honored)

I have a drawer?

ADAM
(sheepish)

Yeah, I just figured I’d put some of your things... there wasn’t anything in the drawer. Well there were a few things, but I just moved them to a different one because... It made sense that way.

RACHAEL
(touched)
Awwwww. Honey. We’re getting so

domestic.

SFX: A CAR HORN.


EXT. ADAM’S HOUSE - SAME TIME

Kyle sits in his car front of Adam’s house, his seat reclined, his eyes squeezed shut, hungover. He honks the horn again, winces at the noise.


INT. BEDROOM - SAME TIME

Adam rushes to gather his things.

ADAM (CONT’D)
Good luck with the paintings.

He moves to her, leans in - despite her mouth full of toothpaste.

RACHAEL
Oops, I’ve got toothpaste in my

mouth.

She wipes it off his nose. He gives her a small kiss.
 




 


RACHAEL (CONT’D)
Have a good day.

ADAM
(big smile)

Bye.


INT. KYLE’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

Adam gets into the car.

KYLE
Yo!

ADAM
Sorry I’m late.

Kyle sniffs the air.

KYLE
...What’s that smell?
(Sniffs Adam)

Did you sit in jam or something?

ADAM
What are you talking about?

KYLE
You smell all fruity.

ADAM
No.
(smells himself)

I ran out of shampoo. I had to use Rachael’s.

KYLE
Well, you smell like you fucked the cast of “The View”.

Adam looks at his watch.

ADAM
Are we gonna go? We’re gonna be

late.

KYLE
If you really care about being on time, you should probably learn how to drive.

ADAM
I deserve that.
 



 


KYLE
You know what’s really going to
make us late? When I stop for

cappuccinos.

ADAM
No, no, no. We have coffee at work.

KYLE
Delicious cappuccinos.

Kyle drives off.


INT. COFFEE SHOP - LATER

Adam and Kyle stand in line. Kyle watches as Adam yawns repeatedly. He looks exhausted.

KYLE
Back still hurts?

ADAM
Yeah, I’m going to see the doctor

today.

KYLE
Have you been fucking in weird

positions?

ADAM
Of course that’s where you have to go with it.

KYLE
Sometimes it happens when I try new positions - like I tried froggy style for a while; fucked up my back.

ADAM
“Froggy style”? I don’t even want

to ask what that is.

KYLE
It’s kind of like doggy style but

you get way higher up.

ADAM
(beat)

We haven’t done it in three weeks.
 






 


KYLE
(shocked)
You haven’t had sex in three

weeks!?

ADAM
Well, she had a yeast infection,

and then she had her period.

KYLE
You can fuck on a yeast infection.

ADAM
No, it hurts.

KYLE
It does?

ADAM
Well, that’s what she says.

KYLE
I think that’s bullshit.

ADAM
No, I’ve heard that before.

KYLE
Has she been sucking on your dick, giving you blow jobs?

ADAM
No, she doesn’t like to.

KYLE
(a little upset)

No fucking shit she doesn’t like to! Who likes putting dicks in their mouths? That’s why they call them jobs!

ADAM
Don’t get hysterical, it’s not that big a deal.

KYLE
I’m not hysterical. She stays at your house all the time. She leaves her fucking shit everywhere. You clean it up. You’re a nice person. The least she can do is felate you.
 
EXT. STREET - MOMENTS LATER

Kyle and Adam walk down the sidewalk. Adam’s a few steps ahead, walking at a hurried pace as Kyle takes his time, sips his coffee.

KYLE
You put up with a lot of shit when you date a hot girl. Truthfully, that’s why if you recall in high school I didn’t date any hot girls.

ADAM
That’s why?

KYLE
Yes. That’s why.

ADAM
Well, we’re not in high school
anymore. The relationship I have
with Rachael is about more than

sex.

KYLE
(condescending)

What is it about, Adam?

ADAM
We care about each other -- talk to each other.

KYLE
Wouldn’t it be nice if you could do that and bang the hell out of each other afterwards?

They walk up the front steps of SEATTLE PUBLIC RADIO.

ADAM
Ideally, yes. But it’s not a perfect world, OK?...Can you hurry up please?

Kyle stops and leans over.

KYLE
Ugh...Just got to tie my shoe.


INT. SEATTLE PUBLIC RADIO - DAY

Adam and Kyle enter the offices of Seattle Public Radio. They pass JENNY at the reception desk. Kyle shoots her a smile.
 


 


KYLE
Morning Jenny.

She ignores him. As they continue, Seth looks over at Adam nervously biting on his finger nails.

KYLE
That’s so gross man. You shouldn’t do that.

PHIL (40), Adam and Kyle’s boss, passes by.

PHIL
Kyle...Adam.

KYLE AND ADAM
Hey Phil.

ADAM
(worried)

Sorry we’re late.

Phil looks at his watch, not even aware of the time.

PHIL
Huh. Look at that, you are late.

Don’t do that.

ADAM
Listen, I wanted to talk to you about the volcano piece, it’s coming along really well, I’ve done all the research and interviews-

PHIL
Great.

ADAM
Yeah but the narration is turning into a bit of a problem. Whoever did it, he kept clearing his throat and he didn’t pause, he just kept talking - there aren’t any edit points. If he had just stopped and cleared his throat I could cut around it, but he didn’t--

Phil’s cell phone rings.

PHIL
Cool.

KYLE
Yeah, grab that.
 



 
 (2)

Phil pulls out his Blackberry and walks off, ignoring the conversation.

ADAM
OK. I’m just going to--

Adam and Kyle watch Phil walk away. Adam turns to Kyle.

ADAM
It's like he doesn't care.

KYLE
It’s like we got to put shit on the air. And it’s pointless to spend months working on something that someone’s going to hear for two seconds stopped at a red light.

ADAM
I like it when my work is good.

KYLE
Good luck with that.


INT. ADAM’S CUBICLE - LATER

Adam sits at his desk, head phones on, editing his volcano story on Pro-Tools. He meticulously edits the same audio point over and over. He cringes at the deafening sound of Kyle’s laughter across the office.

KYLE
(into phone)

You’re in Wales? So does that make you Welsh? Or Wale-ish?

Adam looks at Kyle in annoyance.

KYLE
OK. World Music...Can you hear me? You sound like a robot...Does it sound weird to you? It sounds weird to me...

ADAM
You have to be quieter, I’m--

Kyle is oblivious to Adam.

KYLE
I said you sound like a robot...
Wait, wait, wait. Go back.

(MORE)
 



 

KYLE (cont'd)

It’s unbelievable. I know. I don’t know what ‘World Music’ is either!

Annoyed, Adam imitates Kyle to himself.

ADAM
(as Kyle)

I’m such a fucking asshole. I’m the king of the world, suck my dick. I hear Adam hasn’t gotten his dick sucked in six fucking months.


EXT. PACIFIC GENERAL HOSPITAL - LATER

Adam steps off a BUS and walks toward the hospital’s vast sunlit entryway. He enters through the sliding double doors, eventually disappearing into the din of the crowd.


INT. DR. ROSS’ OFFICE - LATER

Adam leafs through a pamphlet on incontinence when the pedantic DR. ROSS enters.

DR. ROSS
(curt)

Hi.

Dr. Ross looks over Adam’s chart, examines his MRI scans, and pulls out a DICTAPHONE -

DR. ROSS
(into the dictaphone) Patient has been complaining of back pain, and night sweats. Blood tests and urine analysis are normal. MRI suggests a massive intradural malignant schwannoma neurofibrosarcoma extending into psoas muscle with nerve root compression syndrome and bone erosion.

We see Adam’s face gradually look more and more confused. He slowly begins to raise his arm as if to ask a question.

DR. ROSS (CONT’D)
Growth extends from the L2 to L5.
Will send patient for biopsy to

confirm.

Dr. Ross turns to see Adam holding his arm in the air.
 




 


DR. ROSS (CONT’D)
Yes?

ADAM
I’m so sorry, I didn’t follow that.
Is there something wrong with me?

DR. ROSS
(points to MRI)
If you look here on your MRI, you
see this cephalopod-like object
spreading down along your spinal

column?

Adam squints. It all looks the same.

DR. ROSS (CONT’D)
That is a massive schwannoma

neurofibrosarcoma.

ADAM
I’m sorry, I still don’t--

DR. ROSS
It’s a malignant tumor.

ADAM
A tumor?

DR. ROSS
Yes.

ADAM
Me?

DR. ROSS
Yes.

ADAM
That doesn’t make sense...I don’t smoke. I don’t drink. I recycle...

DR. ROSS
Well your case it’s actually quite fascinating. Your cancer is the result of an incredibly rare gene mutation in chromosome 17p in the p53 gene that causes the growth of malignant cells in tissue around the nerves. In your case it’s grown along the nerves in your lower spine.

Adam walks over to the window and peers out.
 



 
 (2)

DR. ROSS
People can go years without knowing they’re sick. We’re lucky we caught it before it metastasizes. Given the placement and size of your particular tumor, the wisest course of action is to see if we can possibly reduce this thing down to a more managable size.
(Beat)
I’m going to put you on a four
month regimen of chemotherapy.
(beat)
Now Chemotherapy can result in

fertility issues--

ADAM
But I’m going to be okay?

Dr. Ross puts on his best act of reassurance. His words are seemingly genuine; his tone is anything but.

DR. ROSS (CONT’D)
If you need to talk to someone...
We have an excellent staff of
social workers and psychologists
here in the hospital. They
specialize in cases...in
these...sort of matters. They’ll be
able to help you.

Dr. Ross continues to talk as Adam looks out of the window.


INT. ADAM’S OFFICE - DUSK

CLOSE ON a computer screen:

“Neurofibromasarcoma Schwannoma is a malignant or cancerous form of Schwanoma.

Treatment Forms: Chemotherapy and Radiation. Surgical resection proven to be most effective. Risks of surgery: Amputation of limbs. Paralysis. Death.

It is a rare tumor type, with a relatively poor prognosis.

Patient response to treatment will vary based on age, health, and the tolerance to medications and therapies.

5 Year survival rate: 50%.

5 year survival rate after metastasis: 0%.”
 




 


He stares at the screen. This is not good. Everyone else is leaving for the day, shutting off lights. Adam stays, immobile and alone.


INT. BUS - NIGHT

Adam sits deep in thought - or in shock - hard to tell. The dusky pink sky of Seattle streaks by through tinted glass.

INT. ADAM’S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM - EVENING

Adam and Rachael are on the couch, her eyes filled with tears.

RACHAEL
Oh Adam...

ADAM
Listen. I don’t expect you to take this on. It’s not like we’re married or anything. If you have to bail, bail.
(off her look)
I hope you won’t--I mean, I want
you with me. But if you have to--

She looks at him, into his eyes, closes hers:

RACHAEL
I’m not going to bail on you, Adam.

She leans over, hugs him.

RACHAEL (CONT’D)
I’m here for you.

ADAM
Thank you.

Rachael rubs Adam’s back.

RACHAEL
It’s going to be okay.

Rachael leans in and puts her forehead against Adam’s.

RACHAEL
Everything’s going to be okay.
 
EXT. COFFEE SHOP - MORNING

Adam and Kyle stand outside the coffee shop. Kyle looks sick.

KYLE
I’m going to throw up.

ADAM
Don’t throw up -- you’ll be fine.

KYLE
I actually think I’m going to throw up.

ADAM
You’re not going to throw up.

KYLE
I’m going to throw up.

ADAM
Just open your eyes...Look at me.

Alright?

They both take a deep breath.

KYLE
What kind of cancer is it?

ADAM
It’s something rare.

KYLE
Well, what’s it called?

ADAM
Schwanoma something...

KYLE
(confused)

Schwanoma?...What’s Schwanoma?

ADAM
That means tumor basically.

KYLE
Do you have a picture of it, can I see it?

ADAM
Why would I have a picture of it?
 






 


KYLE
It’s common practice to fucking get pictures of shit now!

ADAM
It doesn’t look like anything, it’s just a lump.

KYLE
Well are you going to be okay? What are your odds?

ADAM
I don’t know, I looked it up and it said 50/50, but that’s the internet so...

Kyle sighs in relief.

KYLE
(upbeat)

That’s not that bad. That’s better than I thought. You’re going to be fine. You’re young...People beat cancer all the time. Every celebrity beats cancer. Lance Armstrong, he keeps getting it.

ADAM
Yeah.

KYLE
The guy from “Dexter”? He’s OK.

Patrick Swayze; he’s fine.

ADAM
Patrick Swayze?

KYLE
And he’s older.

ADAM
But dude, that guy’s dead.

Kyle looks at Adam in shock.

KYLE
Really?

ADAM
Yeah.
 






 
 (2)

KYLE
That’s really fucked up. I didn’t
know that.
(beat)

Don’t even think about him...Don’t worry about that. You got to look at the bright side here--

ADAM
The bright side of what?

KYLE
You’ll be fine.

Kyle quickly tries to change the subject.

KYLE
What did your parents say? Did they freak out?

ADAM
Oh, I...they...I’m not going to

tell them.

KYLE
You’re not going to tell them? You’ve got to tell them. Your mom’ll probably deal with it better than most people...Your dad has Alzheimer's.

ADAM
Yeah, but you know how she gets.

KYLE
You have to tell her.

ADAM
(concedes)

I know. I’ll tell her.

Kyle takes another deep breath.

KYLE
You’ll be fine. 50/50! If you were a casino game you’d have the best odds!

Kyle pats Adam’s shoulder.

ADAM
Yeah. Thanks.
 





 
 (3)

KYLE
Good talk.

Kyle begins walking away from the coffee shop.

ADAM
You don’t want coffee?

KYLE
I’m awake now.


EXT. ADAM’S HOUSE - DAY

Adam’s mother, DIANE LERNER (58), steps out of her car and onto the curb where she’s greeted by her son.

ADAM
Hi Mom.

DIANE
Hi Honey!

She gives Adam a big hug and kiss. Based on his body language, it’s clear Diane’s very existence annoys the shit out of Adam.

RICHARD LERNER (60) wanders out from behind Diane. On first glance he seems like a perfectly normal middle aged man, but on closer examination it’s clear that Alzheimer's has altered his sense of reality. He extends his hand to Adam.

ADAM
Hi Dad.

RICHARD
Hi, I’m Richard.

DIANE
(to Richard)

This is Adam -- your son. Remember?

Adam shakes his dad’s hand and gives him an awkward pat on the shoulder. It’s clear Richard makes Adam uncomfortable.

RICHARD
Adam...

Meanwhile, Rachael stands on the porch, awkward smile plastered on her face.

RACHAEL
(from porch)

Hi!
 



 


Diane politely nods and waves in her direction as she and Adam walk toward the house.

DIANE
So what’s the big news?

ADAM
It’s nothing...I’ll tell you

inside.

DIANE (CONT’D)
She’s not pregnant?

Adam stops, turns and looks at his mother.

ADAM
Mom!

DIANE
I know, I know, you use protection.

Adam cringes, totally mortified. He stares at her for a beat then turns and walks into the house, shaking his head.

As Diane follows behind she notices the paint on Adam’s porch is chipping.

DIANE (CONT’D)
You need to talk to your landlord

about painting this.

ADAM
It’s fine.

Adam rolls his eyes and walks:

INSIDE

Diane follows after him.

DIANE (CONT’D)
Just give me his number and I’ll

call him.

Diane notices an ABSTRACT PAINTING hanging on the wall above the TV.

DIANE
That’s new.

ADAM
Rachael made it for me...It’s

called “Oppression”.
 




 
 (2)

Rachael leans over and corrects him.

RACHAEL
“Liberation”.

ADAM
That’s right! That one’s
“Liberation”. “Oppression” is in

the bathroom.

Diane feigns a smile, trying to seem impressed.

DIANE
Nice.

RACHAEL
Thank you.


INT. ADAM’S HOUSE. DINING ROOM - EVENING

Adam, Rachael, Diane, and Richard sit at the dinner table, eating pizza. Diane hands Richard a fistfull of pills. Richard takes the pills, puts them in his mouth and swallows. He smiles...Diane scans the house.

DIANE
So, what’s the special occasion?

Adam hesitates.

ADAM
I need to tell you something. But, before I do, you have to promise me you’re going to stay calm.

DIANE
Oh Adam, don’t be so overdramatic.

ADAM
Mom, just promise me. Okay?

DIANE
I promise...You make me out to be

some kind of irrational loon.

ADAM
Have you ever seen “Terms of

Endearment”?

RACHAEL
Oh, Jesus, Adam...Just tell her.
 





 


DIANE
Tell me what?

Here goes nothing.

ADAM
(mumbles)

I have cancer.

DIANE
What do you mean, “I have cancer”?

ADAM
I have cancer. What do you want me to say?

DIANE
When did this happen?

ADAM
(reluctant)

I found out a few days ago.

DIANE
A few days ago?! You waited a few

days to tell me?!

ADAM
I’m sorry.

DIANE
Honey.

Adam nods. Diane’s face literally crumples. She tries to compose herself.

DIANE
(beat)

I’m moving in.

ADAM
What? No. Absolutely not.

DIANE
I’m your mother Adam.

ADAM
You already have enough on your

plate with dad.

DIANE
Who’s going to take care of you?
You can't even drive! Who's going

to take you to your appointments?
 



 
 (2)

Adam looks over at Rachel, who notices.

RACHAEL
(hesitates)

Me. I will. I’m going to take care of him.

Diane sits motionless for what seems like an eternity. The only indication that she’s not dead is the movement of her index finger, which twitches uncontrollably. Adam sits uneasy, trying to anticipate his mother’s next move.

ADAM (CONT'D)
Mom?

Diane calmly rises from her seat and heads to the:

KITCHEN

Adam follows after her:

ADAM (CONT'D)
Mom, what are you doing?

Diane lights the stove, puts up a kettle:

DIANE
I’m making you green tea.

ADAM
Please, will you come sit down?

Diane holds up the package of Green Tea.

DIANE
I saw on “The Today Show” that it reduces your risk of getting cancer by fifteen percent.

ADAM
Well -- I already have cancer.

Adam puts his arm on his mother’s shoulder.

ADAM
Please come back to the table.

Diane hugs him and begins to weep.


INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY

Adam walks down the corridor and stops at a reception desk.
 




 


ADAM
I’m looking for Dr. McKay?

THE ATTENDANT silently points to an office a few doors down.


INT. HOSPITAL OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

The office is a pit of chaos; small with stacks of psychology books and files strewn about. An attractive young woman, KATHERINE (24), sits on the couch reading a file while she eats a rather messy sandwich. She, like her office, is scattered in appearance. She takes a bite of her sandwich as Adam pokes his head in the door. She looks up-

KATHERINE
(mouth full of food)

Can I help you?

ADAM
I have an appointment with Dr.

McKay.

KATHERINE
Oh... please come in...

Katherine removes her files from the couch, while awkwardly balancing her sandwich on top. She rises and puts her hand out to shake Adam’s - he reluctantly shakes it.

KATHERINE
...and please, call me Katherine.

ADAM
(confused)

You’re Dr. McKay?

KATHERINE
I am. Have a sit.
(corrects herself)

Sit down please.

Katherine wraps up her sandwich and puts the rest away. Adam looks her up and down.

ADAM
Aren’t you supposed to be like
sixty-five and wear earth-toned

sweaters?

KATHERINE
(slightly defensive)

Why? Did someone say that’s what I look like?
 



 


ADAM
No. But, if you don’t mind...How

old are you?

KATHERINE
(put off)

Twenty-four.

ADAM
Twenty-four? What are you like

Doogie Howser?

KATHERINE
Who?

ADAM
Doogie Howser...

Off Katherine’s blank look.

ADAM (CONT’D)
...The teenage doctor.

KATHERINE
Does he work here?

ADAM
No. Nevermind...but aren’t you too young to be a doctor?

KATHERINE
(almost laughing)
Oh, technically I’m not a doctor
yet. I wish. I’m actually working
on my doctorate.
(off Adam’s look, trying
to be serious)
This is a training hospital.

ADAM
I see...So have you had many

patients?

KATHERINE
My patient history is not--

ADAM
(shocked)

I’m your first patient, aren’t I?

KATHERINE
No. Not at all.
 





 
 (2)

ADAM
Your second?


ADAM (CONT'D)
Third.

Katie looks at him in silent acceptance. Adam’s eyes widen with concern:

ADAM (CONT'D)
How are the first two doing?

Katherine doesn’t answer. She bites her tongue.

KATHERINE
Can’t talk about that.

ADAM
And this is like part of your

training?

KATHERINE
It’ll be part of my dissertation. But, don’t worry I’m not gonna use your real name.

ADAM
(uncomfortable)

Okay. I guess that’s fine.

An awkward beat. Katherine pulls Adam’s file:

KATHERINE
So, Dr. Ross filled me in on your situation. This must be incredibly difficult.

Adam shrugs.

KATHERINE (CONT'D)
How are you feeling?

ADAM
You know, honestly, I feel fine.

I’ve actually never been more calm.

KATHERINE
(proud of herself)

That’s a very common symptom found in patients like yourself. Right now your body is in survival mode. What you’re actually experiencing is shock...
 



 
 (3)

ADAM
No, I think I’m fine.

KATHERINE
...That’s why you feel that sense
of calm. Would you describe what
you’re feeling as a kind of

“numbness”?

ADAM
I would describe it as fine.

KATHERINE
Because certain patients--

ADAM
(defiant)

I feel great.

Katherine bites her tongue.

KATHERINE
Wonderful, I think that’s wonderful

--	if it’s alright with you, today I’d like to start with some very simple relaxation exercises.

Adam nods, tense.

ADAM
But I am relaxed.

KATHERINE
I know you are. But if you want to lie down...

ADAM
Lie down?

KATHERINE
Yeah.

Adam clearly doesn’t trust her, but lies down. Katherine presses play on her laptop - playing new agey meditation music.

KATHERINE
And close your eyes.

ADAM
Really?
 






 
 (4)

KATHERINE
Yeah, for this to work, you’re

gonna have to trust me.

Adam closes his eyes.

ADAM
They’re closed.

KATHERINE
OK.

MATCH CUT TO:

RACHAEL (O.S.)
No peeking...Keep your eyes closed.


INT. ADAM'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Adam is in the living room with his eyes closed.

RACHAEL
OK. Open your eyes.

Adam opens his eyes to see Rachael standing next to a very old and giant GREYHOUND. The dog stands motionless.

RACHAEL (CONT’D)
Surprise!

Adam’s excitement quickly dissipates.

RACHAEL
His name is Skeletor. He’s a

retired race dog.

ADAM
You got me an old dog?

RACHAEL
He’s not that old.

ADAM
Well, he’s old enough to be

retired.

The dog continues to stand motionless.


RACHAEL
Having a dog helps with the healing process.
 




 


ADAM
Why, does he have a medical

license?

RACHAEL
Forget it. I can bring him back to the shelter in the morning.

ADAM
Well what’s going to happen to him?

RACHAEL
He'll be put back in his tiny cage with ten other dogs who will bully, and rape him, until he’s eventually euthanized.

Beat.

ADAM
Fine, I’ll keep the dog.

RACHAEL
Really?

Rachael's face lights up.

RACHAEL
This is going to be so good for

you, I promise.

Adam grumbles to himself.


INT. SEATTLE PUBLIC RADIO - NIGHT

It’s Adam’s going away party. Draped across the entrance is a “Bon Voyage” banner with an image of a Cruise Ship.

Jenny stands to the side crying as Kyle consoles her.

KYLE
This whole party was my idea.
Thought maybe we could just

celebrate his life.

JENNY
He’s going to get better, right?
 










 


KYLE
I hope so. But, tonight I thought
it’d be best if we didn’t think
about whether he gets better or
not. We should be celebrating the

Adam we all know and love.

Kyle steals a quick glimpse of Jenny’s cleavage.

CUT TO:

Adam stands in the middle of the party with JOE.

JOE
Started chemo yet?

CUT TO:

Adam stands with TED.

TED
So what kind of cancer you got?

CUT TO:

Adam stands with SUSAN.

SUSAN
Want to know the secret to beating this thing?

CUT TO:

Adam stands with GREG.

GREG
My uncle had what you got...

CUT BACK TO:

Kyle’s with Jenny who’s still crying. After a beat, he rubs her arm.

KYLE
I liked to be touched when I cry.

CUT TO:

Phil embraces Adam.

PHIL
(sentimental)

I’m gonna miss you so much.
 




 
 (2)

ADAM
(uncomfortable)

I’m going to miss you too Phil.

Phil leans his head on Adam’s shoulder.

ADAM
Hey, Phil--?

PHIL
Yeah, buddy.

ADAM
I want you to know, I’m still going to finish that Mount Moha Moha story.

PHIL
Take as much time as you need...I

can’t wait to hear it.


Phil continues to hold Adam.


INT. RACHAEL’S CAR - DAY

Rachael’s Prius, which is covered in various Save-the-World type bumper stickers, is parked in front of the hospital. Adam turns to her.

ADAM
I just wanted to say that you’ve been really great the past couple of weeks. Thanks for the ride. And breakfast.

RACHAEL
Thanks for saying that.

Adam opens the passenger side door, and as he gets out, Rachael yells after him.

RACHAEL
Adam.

He turns back and sticks his head in the door.

ADAM
You coming?

She shakes her head hesitantly.
 





 


RACHAEL
If it’s cool, I’ll just wait here.

ADAM
It’s going to take four hours.

RACHAEL
I know.

ADAM
You’re gonna sit here for four

hours?

RACHAEL
Honey, I don’t want to mix that world and this world. It’s like an energy thing, you know?

ADAM
(confused)

Right.

She gives him a kiss.

RACHAEL
Good luck!

Rachael watches Adam as he walks off into the hospital.


INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

A small group of patients, including Adam, sit in the waiting room.

GEORGE, a tall male nurse of Bahamian descent, calls out-

GEORGE
Adam Lerner.

Adam stands.

ADAM
Yep.

Adam follows George into the:


INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

The doors slowly close as they ride down into the bowel of the hospital.
 
INT. CANCER WARD - CONTINUOUS

Walking through the long ominous halls of the hospital basement, Adam passes dozens of sick patients who are being shuttled into Radiation Therapy, Chemotherapy and other various treatment rooms. A sick, fat, bald elderly woman coughs as she passes. Adam winces in disgust.

GEORGE (CONT’D)
This way my baby.

George leads Adam into a Chemotherapy Treatment room.


INT. HOSPITAL. CHEMOTHERAPY ROOM - LATER

Adam is seated in a plush leather chair where he’s hooked into a chemo drip. He's surrounded by three other patients. An 74 YEAR OLD MAN, who munches on macaroons, a MIDDLE AGED BALD MAN, and a BALD WOMAN, who knits as she listens to music on her headphones, a Zen look on her face.

ALAN (84), sitting next Adam, whispers to him:

ALAN
(to Adam)

Want a macaroon?

ADAM
Thanks. I’m alright.

Adam looks down to see that Alan is holding box of macaroons.

ALAN
(whispering)

There’s weed in ‘em.

Adam looks to the middle aged man, MITCH (55), who smiles at Adam as he pops a macaroon in his mouth.

ADAM
I don’t do weed.

ALAN
C’mon. Just get high with us!

Adam reluctantly eats a macaroon. Mitch leans over, stoned as hell.

MITCH
How old are you?

ADAM
Twenty-seven.
 



 


ALAN
That’s just the worst? A perfectly good youth wasted.

MITCH
Alan, stop it. Don’t listen to him, he's just messing with you.

ALAN
(To Adam)

Listen to me, this cancer is bull shit. First your hair’s going to fall out, then your balls’ll shrink. And if that isn’t enough, your dick becomes a constant source of disappointment.


Alan and Mitch laugh like two teenagers.

ADAM
I got to tell you, I was really nervous about this whole cancer thing, and then I met you guys, and boy do I feel better.

Alan and Mitch laugh.

ALAN
(to Adam)
I’m Alan Lombardo: stage 3

lymphoma. Pleased to meet you.

MITCH
Mitch Barnett, metastatic prostate cancer.

ADAM
Oh, I’m Adam Lerner, schwannoma

neurofibrosarcoma.

ALAN
What the fuck is that?

MITCH
Tough break. The more syllables,

the worse it is.

Alan and Mitch laugh. Adam pops another macaroon in his mouth.

ADAM
These are really good.
 




 
 (2)

MITCH
Thanks, my wife made ‘em.

ADAM
(chewing)

...how strong are they?

ALAN
Stroooong.

Adam sits back and closes his eyes. Upbeat music swells...


INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - LATER

Adam walks in SLOW MOTION down the same ominous corridor he entered through before. Only it’s no longer ominous to him. He wears a big huge goofy smirk on his face as he passes:

--a SICK MAN on a gurney

--an OLD LADY wheezing

--a BODY BAG being carted on a gurney

--a FAMILY crying

Adam stops, stares at all the misery around and laughs...


INT. ADAM’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Adam jolts out of bed. His clothes are drenched in sweat. He quickly runs into the bathroom and throws up. A lot.

Rachael wakes up, and knows she should go to him, but can’t. Instead, she faintly calls out-

RACHAEL
Adam, you okay?

Adam says nothing, he just slumps over the toilet seat and throws up again.


INT. HOSPITAL OFFICE - NEXT DAY

Adam looks and feels terrible. His head pounds, causing him to rub it. Katherine sits in the chair next to him. Her tone is a little rigid - masking her lack of experience.

KATHERINE
So how are you feeling after your

first treatment?
 



 


ADAM
It feels pretty bad, gotta say. My head is killing me.

KATHERINE
(empathetic)

Yeah I know. From what I understand it can be pretty rough. But it will pass.

She pats Adam on the arm. Her intention is to set Adam at ease, but the act just makes him more uncomfortable. Startled, he backs away.

ADAM
Uh...huh.

KATHERINE
I think it’s important to remember that these side effects are very normal.

ADAM
Good. I’d hate to think I was

special in any way.

KATHERINE
(nervous)

That’s not what I meant. I was just trying to reassure you.

ADAM
(terse)

Well, thanks.

KATHERINE
I’m sensing some anger. Which is

good.

ADAM
I’m not angry.
(beat)

Why is that good?

KATHERINE
Because you’re expressing yourself. You’re dealing with a really serious illness. That brings up a lot of emotions.

ADAM
You’re trying to make me freak out, right? That’s the goal here?
 




 
 (2)

KATHERINE
I’m not trying to make you freak out. I just want you to get in touch with what’s going on inside. And if you’re angry--

ADAM
(angry)

I’m not angry...Let’s do the relaxation thing... Can we do that? I want to hear some sitars. Go to my happy place and feel the warm of beam of light. Can we do that?

Katherine’s a little shaken by Adam’s outburst. He feels bad - although that outburst did feel kind of good.

KATHERINE
I see...

ADAM (CONT’D)
(beat)
I'm sorry...I was being an asshole.

I didn’t mean to say that.

Katherine regains her footing.

KATHERINE
I don’t need you to take care of
me.
(smiles)

I’m trying to take care of you.

Adam nods, hesitant. Katherine exhales and scribbles on a piece of paper:

KATHERINE (CONT'D) Listen, there’s a few books I’d like you to read. A lot of people find them really helpful. You don’t have to read them cover-to-cover. Just take a look to see if they resonate.

She pats her hand on Adam’s shoulder.

ADAM
I’m sorry, are you going to keep

touching me like that?

KATHERINE
What? This?
 





 
 (3)

Katherine puts her hand back on Adam’s shoulder. Adam pulls away.

ADAM
Yeah. That.

KATHERINE
(frustrated)
I’m trying to help you

feel more at ease.

Adam imitates Katherine’s touching.

ADAM
That’s supposed to make me feel
more at ease? It’s like being

slapped by a sea otter.

KATHERINE
Touching promotes trust. It’s one
of the key ways that hospital
practitioners can help patients
feel more secure in stressful

situations.

ADAM
That’s, um, it’s not -- comforting.

Sorry.

KATHERINE
Really, sea otter? Is this better?

Katherine tries again. This time it’s too gentle.

ADAM
Now it’s just getting creepy.


INT. ADAM’S BATHROOM - DAY

Adam stands in front of the mirror. Kyle stands behind him, tying a towel around his neck.

KYLE
I think you’re making a big, big

mistake. Please don’t do this.

ADAM
What are you talking about?

KYLE
What if you have some weird
Gorbachev bird shit thing on your

head?
 



 


ADAM
I thought you liked this idea?

KYLE
I liked the idea in theory. Now that we’re standing here about to do it, I’m a little worried you’re going to look like fucking Michael Stipe.

ADAM
We have to do it.

KYLE
I’m not going to do it!

ADAM
You said you would!

KYLE
I changed my mind - because if it looks bad, you’ll blame me every time you see your weird screwed up bald head.

Adam grabs the PAIR OF CLIPPERS and goes in for the shave. He pauses.

ADAM
Wait...what do you use this for?

Adam’s eyes widen.

KYLE
You know, my body.

ADAM
When was the last time you cleaned it?

Kyle wipes the clippers on his shirt.

KYLE
Right now.

Adam takes the clippers and proceeds to shave his head. Kyle covers his eyes in horror.

KYLE
Fuck! Dude! Holy Shit!

After a beat, Kyle grabs the trimmers and joins in.

Once finished, Adam looks at his bald head in the mirror.
 



 
 (2)

ADAM
It looks okay, right?

KYLE
No. It looks really weird.

ADAM
Why didn’t we go to a barber?

KYLE
That would have been a much better idea -- if we had paid someone to do it.

ADAM
Instead of using your balls trimmer-

KYLE
And I never wash them, ever. And
it’s not my balls, it’s my

asshole....I’m joking...

ADAM
You’re not joking.

KYLE
No, I’m not.


INT. HOSPITAL. CHEMOTHERAPY ROOM - DAY

Adam, Alan and Mitch sit in their chairs, attached to their CHEMO DRIPS. Adam looks SLIGHTLY WORN.

MITCH
How come we’ve never met Rachael?

ALAN
Yeah. What the fuck?

ADAM
Hospitals kind of freak her out.

Alan and Mitch look at each other and groan.

ADAM
What?

MITCH
(being delicate)

Well Adam, no one likes going to the hospital. That’s not why people go--
 




 


Adam looks at him.

ADAM
No, you don’t get it. She doesn’t
want the negative mixing with the

positive...it’s an energy thing.

ALAN
Sounds to me like a bullshit thing.

Adam takes this in.

ADAM
You guys can meet her after. She’s picking me up. I’m sure she’d like to meet you all...She’s really great, you guys.

ALAN
(not convinced)

Okay.


EXT. HOSPITAL PARKING LOT - DUSK

Adam, standing next to Mitch and Alan, is on his cell phone.

ADAM
Hey it’s me again, just checking to see if you’re close...Talk to you soon.

He hangs up the phone.

ALAN
Sure you don’t need a ride, kid?

ADAM
Oh no, she’s gonna come. I’m sure
she’s just caught up with
something. You guys should head

out, you can meet her next time.

ALAN
Yeah. Sure.

Alan and Mitch give him a sympathetic look at Adam and then walk off together.
