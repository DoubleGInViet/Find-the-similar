EXT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

Adam’s seated on the steps out front. He looks exhausted. Rachael’s Prius speeds into the parking lot and stops in front of him.

RACHAEL
Adam! I know. I’m sorry. Please

don’t be mad.

ADAM
I’ve been calling you for an hour.

RACHAEL
My cell phone died.

ADAM
You don’t have to do this, you

know.

RACHAEL
(remorseful)
I’m sorry. I am. I know, I fucked

up.

ADAM
I even gave you an out.

RACHAEL
I’m doing my best...Can we just go home?

Adam gets in the car, pissed, and they drive off.


INT. BOOKSTORE. SELF HELP SECTION - DAY

Adam and Kyle browse through shelves of books. Adam consults Katherine’s list of books. Kyle grabs the book, and rather then hand it to Adam, he reads the AUTHOR’S BIO on the back jacket of the book.

KYLE
(in excitement)

“Kasper Schlegel is an American ‘medical intuitive’ and ‘mystic psychiatrist’”. ‘Mystic psychiatrist’? What is he like Frodo’s psychiatrist? Why would you buy that?
 







 


ADAM
Because my therapist said I should - (shrugs)

I don’t know.

Kyle ditches the book and picks up one on Mardi Gras.

KYLE (CONT’D)
Let’s go to Mardi Gras!

ADAM
I have a girlfriend, why would I go to Mardi Gras?

KYLE
Oh yeah, your girlfriend, I forgot. Why go to Mardi Gras when you could be here, not getting hand jobs and blow jobs?


From across the store, Kyle notices CLAIRE (30), an attractive employee stacking books.

KYLE
(frustrated)
Well if you’re not going to take

advantage of this, then I am.

Kyle yanks the list of books from Adam and crosses to Claire.
He throws on a charming smile.

KYLE (CONT’D)
Hi-

Noticing Claire’s name tag.

KYLE
Claire. Kyle. Could you help me

find a few books, please?

CLAIRE
Sure.

Kyle hands Claire the list of book titles. She reads.

CLAIRE
Oh.
(Concerned)

Are these for you?...I’m sorry it’s none of my business.
 






 
 (2)

KYLE
No, thank God.	Actually, they’re
for my friend. The little guy in

the hat.

Kyle nods towards Adam across the room.

KYLE
He’s my buddy, he’s really, really sick.

Claire shoots Adam a look - the way one looks at a dying puppy. Adam looks on in confusion.

CLAIRE
How awful.

KYLE
Yeah. He has ‘Type Four Back

Cancer’ - not cool.

CLAIRE
Poor guy.

KYLE
I know. It’s been really hard.
(Feigning sadness)

But I don’t focus on that, I focus on the positive, by taking him out to book stores. I like to take him for walks. Plays. While he has time.

CLAIRE
That’s so nice of you.

Claire leads Kyle off to a stack of books.


INT/EXT. BOOKSTORE - LATER

As Adam and Kyle exit the bookstore, they pass Claire.

KYLE
(to Claire)

I’ll see you tonight.

Then as they exit, and walk along the sidewalk, Kyle can’t help but boast of his achievement; rubbing it in Adam’s face.

KYLE
Thank you, Claire! Nice to meet

you, Claire!
 
INT. ADAM’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Adam’s lying on the couch with a cold washcloth on his head watching TV. The phone rings. He snatches it, checks caller ID: “Mom”. He presses “Ignore”. He checks his RECENT CALLS.

The screen reads “Mom. Mom. Mom. Mom. Mom.” On cue, his land line rings. Frustrated, he answers.

ADAM
What, Mom?

DIANE’S VOICE
Jesus, what took so long to pick

up? Are you okay?

ADAM
I’m fine. I didn’t hear the phone

ring.

DIANE’S VOICE
Do you need anything? I was about to go to the Rite-Aid for your father...You want me to come over? I can bring dinner. I can make macaroni and cheese.

ADAM
Mom, I haven’t liked macaroni and
cheese since I was like ten.
(softens)

It’s all right, Rachael’s going to come over later.

DIANE’S VOICE
You sure?

ADAM
Yes. I’m totally fine...

In WIDE SHOT, Adam sits alone in his house. Seemingly not fine.

ADAM
...Don’t worry so much.

DIANE
All right. If you say so. I love

you.

ADAM
Love you too.
 
INT. ART GALLERY - NIGHT

A hip gallery opening. Kyle and Claire have drinks and stare at awful art.

KYLE
This one is really cool!

CLAIRE
(beat)

My friend did this, actually.

KYLE
(laughs)
No way! Your friend is a real

talent.

Claire moves on to another piece.

CLAIRE
So what do you think of this one?

Kyle turns and looks.

KYLE
Uh oh! I think I have a new
favorite!...This is genius...It’s

making me a little emotional.

Just then Kyle sees Rachael across the crowded room.

KYLE (CONT’D)
Of course, I should have known I’d see her. We’re at a fucking gallery opening.

CLAIRE
Who is she?

KYLE
You know my best friend, the one who’s sick? That’s his pretentious girlfriend.

They follow Rachael as she walks up to a WHITE GUY WITH DREADLOCKS and flirts with him.

CLAIRE
She doesn’t look like someone’s

girlfriend.

Just then Rachael gives the guy a passionate, deep kiss.
 





 


KYLE
Fuck! I knew it!

The kiss goes on long enough for Kyle to take out his cell phone and snap a picture.

KYLE (CONT’D)
(ecstatic)
I nailed that cunt!
(to Claire)

Can you believe it?!

Claire walks away, disgusted. Kyle quickly follows after her.

KYLE
Sorry - I - uh, don’t usually use

words like that.


INT. ADAM’S LIVING ROOM - LATER

Adam is asleep on the couch when he hears Rachael come in.

ADAM
(sleepy)

Hi.

RACHAEL
Didn’t mean to wake you.

ADAM
(reaching for her)

Come here.

RACHAEL
Oh, I’m so tired. Can we just get

into bed?

She holds out a hand to help him up just as Kyle opens the front door.

KYLE
Hey! Surprise! It’s Kyle! What’s

happening, guys?

He couldn’t be in a better mood.

ADAM
(confused)

Hey Kyle.

KYLE (CONT’D)
...bad time? Am I interrupting

something?
 



 


ADAM
Well it’s midni-

KYLE (CONT’D)
Sorry, I was in the neighborhood. I had a date with Claire, the bookstore girl. It did not go well, due to a lack of chemistry and I think an overuse of profanity on my part. But, whilst on my date, I ran into - Rachael.

ADAM
Oh yeah?

Kyle pulls out his cell phone.

KYLE (CONT’D)
I would like to present...

Kyle holds the phone to Adam’s face.

KYLE (CONT’D)
Exhibit...whore!

On the camera screen is a very grainy picture of Rachael kissing the guy at the gallery.

KYLE (CONT’D)
Look! Look at it!!! That’s Rachael! And that’s a fucking dirty Jesus looking motherfucker, and they’re kissing! I did it!
(to Rachael)
I FUCKING NAILED YOU!!! I’ve hated you for months! And now I have evidence that you suck as a person!

Kyle looks at Adam and Rachael’s silent faces.

KYLE
Nothing?
(beat)

You two should probably talk about this...

He steps into the kitchen.

ADAM
You’re cheating on me!?

RACHAEL
No! I mean - yes but-
 




 
 (2)

ADAM
Seriously?

RACHAEL
(coming apart)
Adam - you have no idea how hard
it’s been! I don’t know how to do
this, and it’s been so stressful,
and you’ve been so sick, and shit,
you’re the one who told me Kyle
keeps using your cancer to get
girls! Why should I be the bad guy?

KYLE (O.S.)
Because you’re his girlfriend, and you cheated on him while he has cancer, you fucking lunatic!

RACHAEL
(ignoring Kyle)

Adam. We had problems long before you got sick. And then when you got sick, I didn’t know what to do.

ADAM
So why are you here? Why do you

spend every night in my bed?

RACHAEL
(quietly)
I don’t know. I didn’t want to
abandon you.
(beat)

Let’s go to bed, we can talk about this tomorrow.

Speechless, Adam sits on the couch: humiliated, heartbroken, ruined. Kyle re-enters.

KYLE
I can’t stay in the kitchen any
longer.
(to Rachael)

You got to get out of here! You’re making this way too uncomfortable for everyone. Just leave!

Kyle leads her to the door. She resists.

RACHAEL
Adam, we’ll talk tomorrow.
 






 
 (3)

KYLE
No you won’t! Why would you talk

tomorrow?

RACHAEL
Adam, I care about you...Adam.

KYLE
You are reprehensible!

RACHAEL
(to Kyle)
Will you shut up?!
(to Adam)
Kyle doesn’t have your best

interest in mind.

KYLE
I don’t? Cause I’m pretty sure I’m not the one who got caught making out with some disgusting hippie.

RACHAEL
Fuck you!

KYLE
You’re disgusting!

Rachael slams the door and leaves.


INT. ADAM’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Adam lies in bed. He looks over at Rachael’s empty spot. He inhales, feeling very alone.

Just then Skeletor jumps up and lies down next to him, practically upending the bed. Adam looks at him, pets him.

EXT. STREET - NEXT DAY

Adam and Kyle are out walking Skeletor.

KYLE
This is the best thing that could

have happened to you.

ADAM
Why?
 







 


KYLE
You deserve better, way better. If I was your girlfriend, I’d be baking you cookies and blowing you every thirty minutes...

ADAM
What kind of cookies?

KYLE
Any kind.

ADAM
Would you make me Snickerdoodle

cookies?

KYLE
I’d bathe you in Snickerdoodle.

ADAM
This conversation is making me

nauseous.

KYLE
Actually?

ADAM
No, that was a joke.

Just then an attractive girl, BODI, walking a dog approaches Adam.

BODI
Hi! What’s his name?

ADAM
Skeletor.

BODI
This is Marlowe.

KYLE
Why hello Marlowe!

BODI
You guys live around here?

KYLE
We sure do.

Bodi bends over and pets Skeletor.
 






 
 (2)

BODI
I love greyhounds.
(to Skeletor)

Hellllooo. You’re a good ol’ boy.

Nervous, Adam suddenly gets very protective of Skeletor.

ADAM
We should go, he doesn’t like the
cold.
(to Bodi)

Nice to meet you.

BODI
Nice to meet you!

Adam pulls Skeletor away. The girl continues on her way.

KYLE
You could’ve fucked that girl, you realize that, don’t you?

ADAM
No one wants to have sex with me.

Look at me - I look like Voldemort.

KYLE
You could’ve asked her to go on a doggie date, whipped out the cancer card, fuck the shit out of her!

Adam thinks-

ADAM
You really think a girl’s gonna go for me just because I have cancer?

KYLE
I know it. Help me, help you get

laid.

ADAM
You think that would work?

KYLE
It would totally work!

Adam thinks more.

ADAM
Let’s do it.
 
INT. BAR - NIGHT

The bar is loud and packed with Seattle hipsters. With no room to move, Adam and Kyle stand pressed against the bar counter. The room is hot and Adam’s knit hat is causing him to sweat uncontrollably. Adam scans the crowd - this is definitely not his scene. A very ATTRACTIVE WOMAN leans into the bar.

KYLE
Lot’s of hot girls. Good odds
tonight. Ok, over there, blue

shirt? Go for it.

ADAM
Yeah?

KYLE
Just talk, spark up a conversation.

ATTRACTIVE WOMAN #1
(to the bartender)

One PBR.

Adam leans over to the woman, yelling above the music:

ADAM
How’s it going?

The woman doesn’t even look at him. Kyle leans in.

KYLE
Get into the cancer thing faster.

ADAM
Faster?

KYLE
It’s your hook man.

ADAM
So that’s the first thing I say?

‘Hello, I have cancer.’

KYLE
It’s what sets you apart. You’re

sympathetic. Just try it.

ADAM
OK.

ATTRACTIVE WOMAN #2 (30) squeezes in next to him. She drunkenly bobs her head to the song as she orders a drink.
 




 


Adam reluctantly looks over at the woman.

ADAM
(to the woman)

I love this song.

ATTRACTIVE WOMAN #2
Totally.

ADAM
I have cancer.

Kyle pulls Adam away as the girl looks on, weirded out.

KYLE
I was wrong, I was wrong. Doesn’t
work like that. It doesn’t sound

cool.


INT. BAR - LATER THAT NIGHT

Kyle’s talking to two girls in their mid twenties, ALLISON and JACKIE. Adam stands alone in the distance.

KYLE
I’m Kyle, how’s it going?

ALLISON
Allison.

JACKIE
Jackie.

Kyle shakes their hands.

KYLE
Allison, Jackie. It’s my birthday

today.

ALLISON
Happy birthday!

The girls raise their beers and toast Kyle.

ALLISON
Cheers!

KYLE
I’m here with my buddy actually.

Kyle points out Adam.
 





 


JACKIE
The skinny one?

KYLE
One second.

Kyle rushes over to Adam.

KYLE
I met two girls over there.

ADAM
Are they nice?

KYLE
They are, very nice.

ADAM
Let’s talk to them.

KYLE
Yeah. Take the hat off.

ADAM
What? No.

KYLE
Take it off, take it off.

ADAM
I’m not taking it off.


INT. BAR - LATER THAT NIGHT

The bar’s less crowded now. Kyle and Adam are seated in a booth across from Allison and Jackie.

ADAM
What do you all do?

JACKIE
I just designed the website for the

Swiffer--

ADAM
(excited)

Are you serious? Sorry, I’m a fan. I love the Swiffer! I use it for everything. Sweeping, mopping -- well that’s it really, so not everything.
 





 


The girls looks bored. Adam looks at Kyle out of the corner of his eye-

KYLE
(mouths)

Do it.

Adam shakes him off.

ADAM
I just got a dog and he’s always shedding, and with the Swiffer all I have to do is attach the wet cloth and boom, I’m done.

JACKIE
Oh, I love dogs. What’s his name?

ADAM
Skeletor.

Adam looks back at Kyle then reluctantly pulls off his hat, revealing his bald head.

ADAM
It’s kind of warm in here, isn’t

it?

JACKIE
(stunned)

Oh wow -- you’re bald.

ADAM
Oh no, it’s just cancer.

ALLISON
Cancer?

ADAM
But don't worry, I’m not

contagious.

JACKIE
Oh my god, what kind of cancer is

it?

ADAM
Spinal.

KYLE
It’s in his spine.
 






 
 (2)

JACKIE
Spinal? I didn’t even know that was possible. How'd you get that?

ADAM
I don't know, bad mattress?

She laughs. Adam and Kyle look at each other. They’re in.

KYLE
He still has a sense of humor! It’s inspirational!

JACKIE
Can I touch it? Is that weird?

KYLE
You can do more than touch it!

The girls rub Adam’s bald head.

JACKIE
This is a very nice head.

KYLE
Let’s rub it together.

Kyle reaches out, also rubbing Adam’s head.

KYLE
You know, it’ll grow back if you

rub it enough.


EXT. HOT DOG STAND - NIGHT

Adam slumps against a building, as the Jackie and Allison, now clearly drunk, order food. Kyle approaches.

KYLE
How you doing? You OK?

ADAM
Please let me go to sleep. All I

want is sleep.

KYLE
No! Do not close your eyes. You’ve got to keep going! All we have to do is stay awake until they decide to go to sleep, because if we’re there when they do, sex will happen.
(beat)

(MORE)


 

KYLE (cont'd)
We’re so close... Don’t waste my

time, man!

Adam’s eyes flutter.

ADAM
I’m so tired. Can you give me an
approximate time I‘ll be having

sex?

KYLE
In ninety-five minutes...

ADAM
I can’t wait that long.

KYLE
That’s how long it’ll take!

The girls return with two jumbo hot dogs:

JACKIE
You guys want to hit up Lush? I

know the DJ--

ADAM
I think I’m actually done for the
night. I’m pretty exhausted.
(feigning)

The chemo really wears you out.

Jackie looks at him, disappointed. Kyle is incredulous.

ADAM
(beat)
But, I have some really potent
medical weed if you want to come

over.

ALLISON
That sounds cool.

KYLE
Great idea! Let’s get a cab!

Psyched beyond belief, Kyle nudges Adam.

KYLE
(whispers to Adam)

That was pimp! Very impressive.

Adam smiles at Kyle.
 
INT. ADAM’S BEDROOM. NIGHT

Jackie and Adam lie in bed. She’s on top of him, eyes closed SCREWING HIS BRAINS OUT. Adam looks miserable. With each thrust, he winces in pain.

JACKIE
Am I hurting you?

ADAM
No.

JACKIE
Are you sure?

ADAM
Actually, yeah. It does--

JACKIE
Sorry, I’ll just get off you.

Jackie rolls off him. They lie next to each other awkwardly.


INT. ADAM’S KITCHEN- DAWN

In the rising light of dawn, Adam, in boxers and t-shirt, pours himself some water from a Brita. He puts it back in the fridge. He turns, enters the


INT. ADAM’S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Kyle and Allison lie on the couch, both naked under a blanket, watching a gratuitously violent film on TV.

KYLE
I wonder what the machine gun

budget on this film was.

ALLISON
Can we watch something else?

KYLE
No, I want to see how it ends.

Adam stands in the doorway. Kyle locks eyes with him. Adam’s not happy or sad - just lost. Kyle forces a smile. Adam shrugs and walks back into the bedroom.


MONTAGE VARIOUS DOCTOR’S APPOINTMENT

--CU of a light being shone in Adam’s face.
 



 


--CU of a doctor’s hands pressed against Adam’s lymph nodes.

--CU of a tongue depressor probing Adam’s mouth.

--CU as a nurse slides the weight along a scale.

--CU of blood being drawn from Adam’s forearm.


EXT. HOSPITAL PARKING LOT - DAY

Katherine walks to her car. She notices Adam sitting alone at the BUS STOP.

KATHERINE
Adam?

ADAM
(embarrassed)

Oh hey.

KATHERINE
What are you doing?

ADAM
Waiting for the bus.

KATHERINE
(beat)

I’m on my way home right now - want a ride?

ADAM
Oh, I’m used to the bus, but thank you.

KATHERINE
I can’t let you take the bus.

ADAM
I live kind of far away.

KATHERINE
Won’t take no for an answer.


INT. KATHERINE’S CAR - MOMENTS LATER (DAY)

Adam is seated in the front seat as Katherine drives. The car is filthy - it’s littered with papers, magazines, food wrappers, etc. Katherine’s body is pressed all the way up against the steering wheel with her eyes fixed on the road.
 





 


KATHERINE
Sorry about the mess. I’m not very good at getting rid of things.

ADAM
Yeah, I can see.

KATHERINE
Let me know if you need me to pull over...I know that the chemotherapy can make you...you know...nauseous.

Silent beat as they both stare out the windshield, unsure what to say.

KATHERINE
So, you don’t have a car?

ADAM
No. Don’t even have a license.

KATHERINE
Why not?

ADAM
It’s incredibly dangerous.
(beat)

It’s the fifth leading cause of death. Only a couple after cancer.

KATHERINE
Still. The bus. The bus after

chemo.

ADAM (CONT'D)
Rachael usually drives me -- but we broke up.

KATHERINE
What? When did this happen?

ADAM
A few days ago. She kind of cheated on me.

KATHERINE
Oh. Adam. Do you want to talk about it?

Adam’s about to answer when...

ADAM
No. Nuh-uh. No therapy. You are

giving me this ride as a friend.
 



 
 (2)

KATHERINE
Adam--

ADAM
(looking around)

You know what we could talk about? All of this mess. Are you aware of the bacteria that’s probably living in here?

KATHERINE
Adam, your girlfriend cheated on
you--
(beat)

I know what’s it’s like. Break ups suck, I just broke up with someone a few months ago.

ADAM
I’m sorry.

KATHERINE (CONT’D)
It’s fine. I ended it.

ADAM
How long were you two together?

KATHERINE
Three months --
(uncomfortable)
And we shouldn’t be talking about

this.

ADAM
Why not? You know every thing about me.

KATHERINE
I just don’t think it’s appropriate for me to be telling you all this personal stuff. The whole therapist/patient relationship doesn’t work if you know all my problems.

She smiles, awkward.

KATHERINE
Admittedly, I do check his Facebook page everyday to see if he’s dating someone new. So pathetic-
(beat)
Probably shouldn’t have said that.

We can just listen to the radio.
 



 
 (3)

Adam thinks for a beat. Then looks at the floor, looks at the pile of garbage at his feet.

ADAM
(abrupt)

Stop the car.

Katherine looks at Adam nervously.

KATHERINE
Why? What’s wrong? Are you okay?

ADAM
Just stop the car.

Katherine stops the car. Adam grabs a handful of her garbage and gets out.

KATHERINE
What are you doing?

ADAM
I can’t handle all this mess.

KATHERINE
Are you serious?

Adam tosses the garbage in a dumpster and comes back to the car for more. Katherine laughs as she gets out and joins him.

KATHERINE
Wait, no, not that. That’s my

dinner.

ADAM
Which one?

KATHERINE
This.

Katherine grabs a food container from Adam’s hands.

ADAM
You’re going to eat that?

KATHERINE
Don’t judge me.

They leave Katherine’s dinner behind, then throw out the rest of the garbage.
 
EXT. ADAM'S HOUSE - DUSK

Adam and Katherine arrive at Adam's house.

ADAM
Well, this is me. Thanks for the

ride.

KATHERINE
No problem. Thanks for cleaning my car.

Adam looks at his house. The lights are out. He’s really not in the mood to be alone. He gives out a deep sigh and then gets out of his car.

ADAM (CONT'D)
I’ll see you next week.

KATHERINE
You’ll be all right? By yourself?

ADAM
Yeah. Totally. I’m fine.

He gets out of the car and walks away. Katherine looks after him, with concern. She rolls down her window.

KATHERINE
Hey--

Adam turns around.

KATHERINE (CONT'D)
I want you to have my cell number.

Call me if you ever need anything.

Katherine scribbles her cell phone on a piece of paper and hands it to Adam.

ADAM
(teasing)

Did I just score your digits?

Katherine turns red.

KATHERINE
(uncomfortable)

No.

ADAM
That was a joke.
 





 


KATHERINE
(awkward)

That’s fine. Jokes make for a good coping mechanism...This is only for emergencies.
(beat)
Or if you need someone to talk
to...Good night.

ADAM
Good night.


INT. ADAM'S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM - DAY

Adam and Kyle smoke a mini-bong bubbler as they watch “Planet Earth” on a brand new 50” flat screen TV. Skeletor is asleep on the floor.

KYLE
I thought the desert was crazy. The ocean’s fucking nuts, man.

ADAM
I like the trees.

KYLE
The trees are going to be bananas.

There’s a knock at the door. Too engrossed in the TV, neither guy moves. Rachael pops her head in the door. She looks at Adam nervously as he puts on his hat, covering his bald head.

RACHAEL
Hey -- I’m just here to pick up my things and then I’ll be out of your way.

Adam does his best to play it cool.

ADAM
I put all of your things in a box.

It’s outside the door on the porch.

KYLE
Walked right past it.

RACHAEL
Oh. Okay. Well then I guess I’ll be on my way.
(then noticing)

Are you smoking weed?
 





 


ADAM
Yeah.

RACHAEL
Since when do you smoke?

ADAM
It’s medicinal.

RACHAEL
(impressed)
You got a prescription for

medicinal marijuana?

KYLE
No, I got a prescription for
medicinal marijuana, Adam was too

afraid.

RACHAEL
What’s wrong with you?

KYLE
I have night blindness. Rods and
cones are eschew, and weed fixes

it.

Rachael grins and rolls her eyes. She notices the new TV, which has replaced her painting on the wall. The painting sits stashed in the corner. Sadness sweeps across her face.

RACHAEL
(disappointed)

You took my painting down.

KYLE
It didn’t really fit there with the new TV.

RACHAEL
Adam, can I talk to you outside for a second please?


EXT. ADAM'S PORCH - MOMENTS LATER

Adam and Rachael exit Adam’s house and sit on the porch stoop.

RACHAEL
So...how are you feeling?

ADAM
Pretty awesome.
 



 


RACHAEL
I wanted to tell you I’m sorry.

ADAM
(contrite)
I’m sorry too, I know this wasn’t
easy for you. And I’m sorry I
didn’t come to your opening, it’s

only because I hate you so much.


RACHAEL
(embarrassed)

I’m glad you didn’t come. It was a complete disaster. No one bought any of my paintings.

ADAM
(smiles)

Really?...But they’re...so...great.

RACHAEL
Really?

ADAM
Yeah, you’ll get it next time.

She hugs him.

RACHAEL
I don’t want to break up. I can be better. We can start over again.

She kisses him.

RACHAEL
I’ll just be better.

He kisses back. After a beat.

ADAM
You should go.

She continues kissing him. He continues kissing back. He struggles to pull back, but does. He stares at her, shakes his head-

ADAM (CONT’D)
Please...I need you to get the fuck off of my porch now.

Rachael looks at Adam, pissed, hurt, ego shattered. She picks up her belongings, turns and walks toward her car.
 




 
 (2)

Adam notices Rachael’s painting still on the porch.

ADAM (CONT’D)
Your painting.

RACHAEL
I made it for you.

Rachael continues to her car. A beat. Adam then gets up off the porch and walks inside.


EXT. ADAM’S BACKYARD - DAY

TIGHT ON: Rachael’s Painting.

Adam and Kyle are hammering it to a tree. From a box of various supplies, they pull out the following items and destroy the painting: kitchen knives, screw driver, garlic press, a Molotov cocktail made out of hair-spray, eggs, orange juice, shaving cream, and an ax.

Adam and Kyle look down at the destroyed painting.

ADAM
It actually looks a lot better.

KYLE
It’s not that bad.

ADAM
Yeah, we could hang this up.


EXT. MITCH’S HOUSE - BACK PORCH - DAY

Adam, Kyle, Mitch and Alan laugh hysterically as they smoke a joint.

ADAM
(to Alan)

You were around before TV, right? Because I want to hear about the radio...They talk about people just sitting around and listening to the radio--

ALAN
Glued to the radio.

ADAM
What did you listen to?
 





 


ALAN
“Little Orphan Annie”.

KYLE
What did you look at when you were listening, nothing?

ALAN
It engaged everything.

ADAM
I’m doing a radio piece on a

volcano.

KYLE
I do radio I think people will actually like. Mostly stuff about food...Like hamburger. People like listening to that versus “Coming up next, a volcano!”.

MITCH
You know what I’d do? I’d turn on

the TV.

ADAM
It’s not the same.

Just then, an attractive fifty-something woman, BERNIE, carries out a tray of wheatgrass.

MITCH
Thank you, sweetheart. Bernie just blended up some wheatgrass. Beware, it’s like drinking liquid lawn cuttings.
(beat)
Oh, Bernie, this is Adam.

ADAM
Hi. This is my friend Kyle.

Kyle takes a sip of wheatgrass and nearly gags.

BERNIE
(re: wheatgrass)

You like it?

KYLE
(in disgust)

It’s not good.

Bernie smiles, amused by Kyle, then turns back to Adam.
 




 
 (2)

BERNIE
So, you’re Adam? From the way Mitch described you I thought you were much older.

KYLE
He was eighty-five years old when

he was three.

Mitch looks at his wife adoringly and takes her hand.

MITCH
Come here.

Mitch pulls her close her for a kiss. Adam looks at them, envious, a thin smile on his face.


INT. KATHERINE’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Adam walks in, flustered and annoyed as he talks to his mom on the phone. He sits down -- wrapping up the conversation.

ADAM
(annoyed)
Mom it’s not a virus!...No, it’s

the screen saver.

Adam mouths sorry to Katherine.

ADAM (CONT’D)
...Please, I’m telling you, just
move the mouse...mom I can’t talk
now. I have an appointment. Yes,
right now. I’m standing inside the
office as we speak...I don’t know
what I’m making for
dinner...something, I’ll figure it
out.

Adam looks at Katherine, embarrassed.

ADAM (CONT’D)
...Mom, I really have to go. OK,
hanging up the phone now. OK, I

know...Love you too.

Adam hangs up the phone. Takes a deep breath.

ADAM (CONT’D)
Sorry about that.
 






 


KATHERINE
Don’t worry about it. I have

parents too.

Adam grimaces.

ADAM
Do yours give you migraines?

KATHERINE
My parents are something I would

talk about with my therapist.

ADAM
Really?

KATHERINE
Yeah, we could role play. I can be your mom.

ADAM
(repulsed)

Oh God, no. That’s disgusting.

KATHERINE
Why is that disgusting?

Adam sighs.

ADAM
My mom is a crazy person who worries incessantly. Honestly, it annoys the shit out of me. And it’s not helpful...I can’t talk to her.

Katherine thinks - connects the dots in her head.

KATHERINE
So now she has a husband she can’t talk to, and a son who won’t talk to her.

Adam’s taken aback by Katherine’s bluntness.

ADAM
Well, yeah, I guess.

KATHERINE
I mean, aren’t you being kind of a dick?

ADAM
I’m sorry? Is that a medical term?
 




 
 (2)

KATHERINE
Your parents are who they are, you can’t change that. The only thing you can change is how you choose to deal with them.

ADAM
Aren’t you supposed to subtly
manipulate me into being aware of

my faults? Not call me out.

KATHERINE
I think we’re beyond that point.

You did clean my car.

Katherine looks at Adam with tenderness, grabs hold of his shoulder, squeezing it.

KATHERINE (CONT’D)
(frustrated)
It’s weird, isn’t it? Shouldn’t
have done it. Shouldn’t have gone

for it.

ADAM
No, it was good, it was good.

KATHERINE
No, it wasn’t. It’s so forced.

ADAM
Here try again, I was too far. Come in a little closer.

He inches closer to her, and sticks out his shoulder.

KATHERINE
I’m going to make it real natural.

Katherine places a hand on him, testing.

ADAM
That was better.

They share a smile. After a beat Katherine looks down - self consciously.


INT. HOSPITAL. CHEMOTHERAPY TREATMENT ROOM - MORNING

Adam sits down next to Alan, but notices there’s no Mitch.

NURSE
You’re all set.
 



 


ADAM
Where’s Mitch?

ALAN
(somber)

He died last night.

ADAM
But we were just with him, what

happened?

ALAN
(shrugs)
What does it matter, his heart

stopped.

They can’t look at one another.


EXT. LINDEN CEMETERY - DAY

Kyle’s car drives up the cemetery’s long driveway.


EXT. LINDEN CEMETERY - DAY

Dressed for a funeral, Adam and Kyle walk through the grounds passing hundreds of tombstones along the way. Adam is morose; Kyle is trying to cheer him up.


EXT. MITCH’S FUNERAL - DAY

Adam, Kyle and Alan stand next to a MINISTER as he speaks.

Bernie stands in front of them, trying to hold it together.

We PUSH IN on Adam, as the Minister’s voice recedes into the background.


INT. ADAM’S LIVING ROOM - DAY

Adam lights a joint. He turns on the TV. Matlock appears on his flat screen TV. Adam flips the channels. And finally to the NEWS -- BREAKING NEWS: MT. MOHA MOHA ERUPTING. Adam watches the volcano erupt with bittersweet sadness.


INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

Adam lies on the bed of an MRI machine. His body is slowly drawn into the scanner.
 
INT. HOSPITAL. KATHERINE’S OFFICE - DAY

Adam lies on the couch staring at the ceiling.

ADAM
I’m just beginning to realize that

I'm probably going to die.

KATHERINE
Did something happen? Did you get

the MRI results back?

ADAM
No, but look at me, I'm not getting any better. I look in the mirror and it’s pretty obvious.
(beat)
Mitch died, Alan’s probably going
to die, and so am I.

KATHERINE
You don’t know that...A lot of what you’re feeling is from the treatment.

ADAM
Look. Thank you, but you don’t need to try and cheer me up. I mean, in the end, what does it really matter anyway? We’re all going to die.
You’re just going to die, hopefully a lot later than I am.

Not expecting this turn from Adam, Katherine’s demeanor stiffens - she looks anxious.

KATHERINE
Adam, okay, what you’re going through - is something called “The Alienation Phase”...And I know that you’re feeling helpless inside, but you should know that this is totally normal for someone in your situation.

ADAM
(annoyed)

I’m sorry, but, I’m going to have to call you on that. It’s bullshit. That’s what everyone has been saying. “You’ll get better” and “It’ll be fine”.

(MORE)
 




 

ADAM (cont'd)
I don’t know why everyone is so
fucking scared to say it. “You’re

dying, dude”...It makes it worse.

KATHERINE
(speechless)

Adam, I’m here to help you.

ADAM
Why? So that when you’re at some dinner party in 30 years, you can tell some inspiring anecdote about you coached your third patient through the alienation phase, and helped him feel “normal” right before he died.

KATHERINE
Adam...I...I’m sorry - if - I said

the wrong things. I-

ADAM
This isn’t working for me.

Adam leaves. Katherine is overcome with a sense of failure.


INT. ADAM’S HOUSE - DAY

The place is a mess.	Adam dials the phone.

KYLE (V.O.)
Not around. Leave a message.

ADAM
Hey man, it’s Adam. I was wondering if you could give me a ride to my doctor’s appointment today...It’s the big one.

Adam hangs up and hesitates. After a beat, he dials again.

Adam holds the phone away from his ear and cringes. A pang of regret runs through his body.

DIANE
Oh my God, what’s wrong?

ADAM (CONT’D)
Hi Mom.
 
INT. DR ROSS’ OFFICE - DAY

Diane, Adam and Richard are seated in the exam room. Diane and Adam nervously flip through magazines while Richard is lost somewhere in his own world. The tension is thick. Diane looks at her watch and shivers. There’s a knock at the door. A friendly looking Nurse enters.

FRIENDLY NURSE
The doctor’s just in with another patient, but should be out in a few minutes. You guys holding up alright?

DIANE
It’s very cold in here. Is there
anyway you can turn down the air

conditioning?

FRIENDLY NURSE
Unfortunately the temperature is

controlled by a central thermostat.

DIANE
My son has cancer.

FRIENDLY NURSE
(feels bad)
I’m sorry, really, if I could I
would, but there’s nothing I can

do.

Adam’s pissed that his mother has just involved him.

ADAM
(smiles to the Nurse)
Don’t worry about it.
(Scowls at Diane)

I’m fine.

FRIENDLY NURSE
Are you sure? I could get you a

blanket.

ADAM
No, really, I’m okay. But thank

you.

DIANE
I’d love a blanket.

ADAM
(to the friendly Nurse)

We’re fine.
 



 


FRIENDLY NURSE
Okay, but you let me know if you

need anything.

The Nurse smiles and then exits.

DIANE
(Re: the friendly Nurse)

I don’t like her.

Diane puts her hand on Adam’s forehead.

DIANE (CONT’D)
You feel warm.

ADAM
I’m fine.

Diane gets up from her chair and paces around the room looking at the doctor’s various degrees on the wall. Adam looks on, annoyed at every step his mother takes. Diane closes in on one of the degrees and puts on her reading glasses for further examination.

DIANE
(disapproving)

Huh.

ADAM
What?

DIANE
Oh, nothing.

ADAM
(annoyed)

What?

DIANE
It’s nothing, he went to a state

college.

ADAM
You’re unbelievable.

DIANE
I just worry that you’re not
getting the best care possible.
(beat)
And I don’t think you’re eating

right.

Adam can’t take it anymore. He explodes.
 




 
 (2)

ADAM
Will you stop! I’m not him. I can

take care of myself.

Diane is so frustrated, she’s near tears:

DIANE
It’s so hard that you don’t let me help you. It’s really hard.

ADAM
You are helping me. You brought me here, didn’t you?

They sit in silence for a moment.

ADAM (CONT'D)
What about you?

She looks at him, baffled:

DIANE
What about me?

ADAM
How are you?

DIANE
(wiping her tears)

How am I?

ADAM
How are you? What’s going on in

your life?

DIANE
Seriously? Nothing is going on in
my life. The highlight of my week
is this cancer support group I’ve

been going to.

ADAM
You’ve been going to a support

group?

DIANE
It’s for parents whose kids have

cancer.

ADAM
I didn’t know you were doing that.
 






 
 (3)

DIANE
How would you? You never call me

back.

He looks at her. He softens.

ADAM
I’m sorry.

DIANE
You don’t have to say you’re sorry.

Adam takes her hand in his. She’s clearly moved. A beat. Dr. Ross storms into the room carrying a stack of MRI films. He seems rushed.

DR. ROSS
Sorry to keep you folks waiting.

Adam and Diane look at Dr. Ross with blank stares.

DR. ROSS (CONT’D)
Anyway I’ll cut to the chase. The
cancer’s not responding to the

chemo.

Dr. Ross places the MRI into the light box.

DR. ROSS (CONT’D)
As you can see, the tumor is
continuing to grow here, along the
nerve. We have to remove it now or

we risk metastasis.

Adam and Diane squint to see what Ross is talking about, but see nothing.

ADAM
So what do we do?

DR. ROSS
We need to operate. Now,
I was able to move some things
around, and I can get you in this
Thursday morning with Dr.
Walderson. He’s one of our best
neurosurgeons.

DIANE
But he’s going to be okay, right?

You’re going to fix it.
 






 
 (4)

DR. ROSS
Considering the placement and size of the tumor, a surgery of this nature is very dangerous, and potentially life threatening itself. The surgeons will be very aggressive in their attempt. But if we’re unsuccessful in removing the cancer...then unfortunately we’re out of options.

Diane takes hold of Adam’s hand. They sit silently as the doctor’s words soak in.


EXT. PARK - LATER THAT NIGHT

Adam sitting in the park over looking the city. Kyle is drunk - Adam is still nursing his first beer.

KYLE
I’m not going to bring up the fact that your surgery is tomorrow. Not even thinking about it. So don’t worry about it, cause I’m not going to bring it up.

ADAM
You remember the last time we came out here?

KYLE
It was prom night.

ADAM
That memory is so far from me...

KYLE
It was a long time ago, I don’t

even remember who you went with.

ADAM
(bitter)

Nora Mattingly.

KYLE
Oh yeah. That girl sucked. You
really know how to pick ‘em. Even

then I think you knew.

ADAM
She seemed so sweet.
 





 


KYLE
She was never sweet. She always

sucked.

ADAM
You just always hate my girlfriends

KYLE
That’s not true... OK it is, actually. But it’s because you date fucking dickheads. Needy bitches. Whhhhyyyyyy?

Adam looks like he’s on the verge of falling apart. Kyle puts his arm around him.

KYLE (CONT’D)
It’s fucking cold. And it’s only midnight! Dude, let’s go to a bar, try to get laid.

ADAM
(annoyed)

Don’t you ever give up?

KYLE
C’mon! I had fun with that!

Kyle points at Adam’s head as he stands, then stumbles. He’s drunk.

ADAM
I know you had fun.

KYLE
You could too, maybe.

ADAM
You’re drunk.

KYLE
It worked! Take your hat off!

ADAM
I think I should drive.

KYLE
I would let you drive but you don’t know how. You don’t have a license.

ADAM
(somber)

This might be my last chance.
 




 
 (2)

KYLE
Driving! That’s what you want to do? That’s your “Make A Wish”? To drive? We could be having sex with hookers while skydiving, and instead you want to do something I learned to do when I was fifteen!
(concedes)
Fine, but be careful.

Kyle hands Adam his keys.

KYLE (CONT’D)
Drive carefully. And don’t adjust

my seat settings.

The two climb into Kyle’s car. Adam puts the key in the ignition.

KYLE (CONT’D)
(condescendingly)

Now, first thing you want to do--

Without checking the mirrors, he backs the car up. BOOM the car SLAMS into a BIKE RACK.

KYLE (CONT’D)
What the fuck!

Adam pulls out of the parking lot.

KYLE (CONT’D)
Make a left. Make a left! It’s a

one way street!

Adam turns left onto a one way street. It’s the wrong way.

KYLE (CONT’D)
What the fuck? There’s a car! Wrong way! Wrong way! Wrong way! What the hell!

An oncoming car honks and swerves out of the way - only nearly avoiding a head on collision.

KYLE (CONT’D)
Adam! Stop man - stop!

Kyle pulls the emergency brake. The car stops abruptly.

KYLE (CONT’D)
The fuck are you doing, man? You’re being an idiot right now.
 




 
 (3)

A beat.

ADAM
Get out. Get out of the car.

Kyle stammers as Adam looks like he’s about to erupt.

ADAM
GET! OUT!

Adam starts hitting Kyle.

KYLE
Jesus Christ!


Kyle looks at Adam speechless, and then gets out of the car.

Adam locks the doors and sits quietly for a moment. He then proceeds to scream at the top of his lungs. Twenty seven years worth of suppressed emotions come out. Adam then sits in total silence. After a beat, he pulls out his cell phone. Kyle notices. He tries to open the door. It’s locked. Adam ignores Kyle and begins to dial.

KYLE (CONT’D)
Don’t you dare call her! Not after everything she’s done to you...You’re a pussy, Adam.

ADAM
You’re a selfish piece of shit who cares more about getting fucking laid than being my friend.

Kyle looks hurt. Adam holds the phone up to his head.


INT. BEDROOM - SAME TIME (INTERCUT)

The phone rings. It’s not Rachael...it’s Katherine. She’s sitting on her bed, reading a book.

KATHERINE
Hello.

ADAM
(nonchalant)

Hey, it’s Adam.

KATHERINE
Adam?

She looks at the clock, it’s midnight.
 



 


KATHERINE
It’s midnight. What’s going on?

ADAM
(still nonchalant)
Oh, just having a nervous
breakdown. I think I fractured my

larynx.

KATHERINE
I’m really, really glad you called.

There’s a long silence. Tears roll down Adam’s face.

ADAM
I want this to be over. I’m so
fucking tired of being sick...if
this surgery doesn’t work, that’s
it --
(crying)
I’ve never been to fucking Canada
or told a girl I love her...it
sounds stupid.

KATHERINE
No. It doesn’t.

Katherine’s eyes begin to well.

ADAM (CONT’D)
(beat)

I’m sorry I was such an asshole.

KATHERINE
I was the asshole. I was so totally unprepared - for you. This job is really hard. If I fuck up, I could ruin someone’s whole life.

ADAM
I guess we’re both beginners at

this.

KATHERINE
(smiles)

Yeah.

A beat.

ADAM
What were you doing when I called?

Were you on Facebook?
 





 
 (2)

KATHERINE
(laughs)

You know, stalking my ex-boyfriend isn’t the only thing I do in my free time.

A beat. Adam sighs:

ADAM
I wish you were my girlfriend.

She takes this in, kind of wishing it too.

KATHERINE
Girlfriends can be nice. You just

had a bad one.

ADAM
Yeah, but I bet you’d be a good

one.

Silence as Katherine blushes. Then: There’s a loud knock on the window. It’s Kyle. He’s freezing.

KYLE
Let me in man, Jesus. It’s fucking freezing!

ADAM
I’m going to go. Thanks...Thanks

for everything.

KATHERINE
Good night.

Adam hangs up the phone. Kyle bangs on the car window desperately. Adam finally unlocks the car.


EXT. KYLE’S APARTMENT - LATER THAT NIGHT

Kyle and Adam enter the building.


INT. KYLE’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

Too drunk to stand, Kyle uses Adam as a crutch to support himself as they enter his apartment, which is a mess - it looks like it hasn’t been cleaned in years. Kyle is unusually quiet. The mood is solemn - these guys never fight.

Kyle keels over to pass out on the couch. Adam walks into the bathroom.
 
INT. KYLE’S BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

With his finger, Adam scoops some dust up off the counter. Grossed out, he looks around for a towel to wipe the dust off his hand. No towels. He wipes it off on his jeans. He then notices something on the ground, in front of the toilet. A book. He leans over and picks up “Coping with Your Loved One's Cancer”. The book is worn and has multiple book marks - indicating it’s been read. Adam looks out at Kyle, he had him pegged all wrong. Adam then turns and looks at himself in the mirror. He takes a deep breath. A beat. He claps his hands - the lights turn off.

EXT. SEATTLE STREET - LATER THAT NIGHT

It’s 3 a.m. The streets are completely vacant of life. Adam walks along this normally busy avenue all alone.


EXT. STREET - DAWN

Adam walks along the sidewalk of his street and turns up his front walkway.


INT. ADAM’S HOUSE - DAWN

Adam packs a small DUFFEL BAG.


INT. ADAM’S KITCHEN - LATER

Adam kneels down, pours some dog food into a bowl for Skeletor. He looks at the dog, who looks back, confused.

ADAM
Come here, boy.

Skeletor begins to eat. Adam looks in Skeletor’s eyes and gives him one last pet.


EXT. ADAM’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Adam steps out onto the porch carrying his duffle bag. As he walks down the steps, he looks back at his house, takes a deep breath, and leaves.


I/E. KYLE’S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

Adam gets into Kyle’s car. The mood is eerie and quiet.
 
INT. KYLE’S CAR - LATER

Kyle and Adam sit silently parked in front of the hospital.

KYLE
(beat)

You ready?

ADAM
Yeah.

KYLE
It’s going to be good. It’s going

to be fine.

ADAM
Yeah.

We hear a voice from across the parking lot.

KYLE
That’s your mom.

Adam rolls down the window. Sure enough, his mom is yelling from across the parking lot-

DIANE’S VOICE
Adam!

KYLE
So I’ll park the car I guess, and

then come inside--

ADAM
Yep.

KYLE
--and I’ll see you before you go in there?

ADAM
Um...I’m not sure how it works.

KYLE
Then I’ll see you after...

ADAM
Yep.

Kyle looks at him unsure what to say. Adam leans across and hugs Kyle.

KYLE
So I’ll see you in there...
 



 


ADAM
Thanks.

Adam steps out of the car and walks across the vast concrete expanse toward his mother and father who stand waiting for him.


INT. HOSPITAL PRE-OP ROOM - EARLY MORNING

Adam lies on a gurney. His parents stand beside him. DR.
WALDERSON the neurosurgeon enters.

DR. WALDERSON
Good morning, I’m Dr. Walderson,
I’ll be performing your surgery

today...How are you feeling?

ADAM
Good.

DR. WALDERSON
Good. Good. Good. Good.

Dr. Walderson looks over her chart.

DR. WALDERSON
So we’re going to take excellent
care of you. Our surgical team is

top-notch. You just try to relax.

Adam’s completely terrified. Dr. Walderson exits. Nurse Stewart hands Adam a giant pile of disclaimers to sign.

ADAM
What is all this?

NURSE STEWART
Standard paperwork: hospital
liability and disclaimer forms and

organ donor authorization.

Richard whispers closely into Adam’s ear:

RICHARD
I got a new coat... Brooks

Brothers. Silk Pockets. Feel.

Adam sticks his hand inside the pocket of Richard’s coat.

RICHARD(CONT'D)
Feel.
 





 


ADAM
I am feeling.

Adam looks up at his dad, standing there in his confused state:

ADAM
Dad, listen. I know it’s probably hard to follow what’s going on right now -- but I want you to know that I love you very much.

Richard looks at his son, blank expression on his face:

RICHARD
OK.

ADAM
OK, Dad.

Adam smiles at his father, and then looks at his mother. DR. LEE enters-

DR. LEE
Hello Adam, I’m Dr. Lee -- I’m here to administer your anesthesia.

ADAM
(nervous)

Hi.

DR. LEE
Now relax, I’m going to inject the anesthesia through your IV... It’s going to take a few moments before you begin to feel the effects...

ADAM
You’re doing it now?

NURSE STEWART
(to Diane and Richard)

If you guys could just head over to the waiting room that’d be great.

ADAM
How long will it last?

DR. LEE
That really depends on the

individual--
 






 
 (2)

ADAM
Well, how do you know if it’s going to last long enough so I won’t wake up in the middle of surgery? Or what if I don’t wake up after? Mom?

DIANE
Sweetie you’re going to be just

fine.

He leans over the bed into his mother’s arms. She holds him for a long beat.

DR. LEE
I’m really sorry but we’ve got to

get Adam to the operating room.

DIANE (CONT'D)
Could you just wait a moment,

please?

Dr. Lee unlocks Adam’s gurney.

DR. LEE
I’m sorry.

Diane kisses Adam on the cheek.

DIANE
I love you, Adam.

Dr. Lee nods to a couple nurses, who pull Adam’s gurney through double doors. He disappears into fluorescence.

INT. HOSPITAL SURGICAL AMPHITHEATER - CONTINUOUS

Adam’s gurney is PULLED INTO frame. We push in on Adam’s unconscious face. Now, several ARMS reach out and grab him, placing him on the operating table.

SFX: The rhythmic beep of his heart monitor. The echoing sound of his breath. It initiates a


MONTAGE

--Katherine sits in her office, talking to a patient. She nods, jots notes, but her head is somewhere else.

--Diane and Richard sit in the waiting room. She holds a handful of pills. Richard takes them from her. She looks into his eyes, terrified.
 




 


--	IN A WIDE SHOT, we see the operating table. Two neurosurgeons, Dr. Walderson and DR. PHILLIPS are in mid-surgery. Alongside the two doctors are TWO NURSES.

--	Kyle stands outside the hospital’s front entrance. Next to him, a couple of NURSES on a smoke break talk animatedly. He stares ahead, nervous.

--	The operating room is empty. Adam lies on the surgical table, now face up with an oxygen mask over his mouth. His eyes are closed and his complexion is cold and pale.


INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM - LATER

Diane, Richard and Kyle sit together, anxious. Katherine enters the room and sits across from the others. They exchange awkward looks.

DIANE
(to Kyle)

It’s been five hours.

Kyle looks over clearly very aware of that fact:

KYLE
Has it?

DIANE
Something’s wrong. We should have

heard by now.

KYLE
Don’t worry. Adam’s going to be

fine, okay?

Katherine hears Adam’s name. She leans over to Kyle, Richard, and Diane.

KATHERINE
Adam Lerner?

KYLE
(startled)

Yeah.

KATHERINE
Dr. Walderson is one of the best surgeons in the country, so he’s in good hands.

DIANE
Who are you?
 




 


KATHERINE
I...uh, I’m Katherine.

KYLE
The therapist! I’m Kyle, Adam’s

friend.

They shake hands.

KYLE
These are Adam’s parents.

KATHERINE
It’s nice to meet you.

She smiles and nods awkwardly. Long beat.

KYLE
Did he say I was a dick? ‘Cause I’m not.

DIANE
I want you to know, I smothered him because I love him.

Katherine smiles politely.

KYLE
Seriously, did he say anything?

KATHERINE
I...I can’t...I wouldn’t...I
wouldn’t talk about that sort of

thing.

Kyle and Diane turn their attention away from Katherine, dejected. In the distance, they spot Dr. Walderson. Everyone jumps up as she approaches:

DR. WALDERSON
Mr. and Mrs. Lerner. So as you can imagine, with a surgery of this magnitude...there were some unforeseen complications. The bone erosion was much greater than initially anticipated. We had to remove part of the hip and pelvis, as well as most of the right psoas muscle. We also had to remove a good amount of sheath tissue around the sciatic nerve. It’s not going to be an easy road back, but he’s going to be okay.
 




 
 (2)

DIANE
(relieved)

He’s going to be okay?

Dr. Walderson nods.

KYLE
You should start with that
information. That should be the

first thing you say.

He turns to hug Diane:

KYLE (CONT'D)
He’s OK!

Diane and Kyle hug, then pull Richard into the hug.

DIANE
(to Dr. Walderson)

Thank you, doctor, thank you!

Diane and Kyle start crying. Katherine sees this tender moment and shies away.


INT. HOSPITAL POST-OP RECOVERY - DAY

Adam’s in his hospital bed - still asleep from the surgery. Richard and Diane enter the room. Adam reacts like a little kid being picked up from pre-school.

ADAM (CONT’D)
Mommy!

DIANE
(crying)

My little boy.

ADAM
It’s nice here. I got a good room.

DIANE
I know.

ADAM
We need to go on more vacations.

DIANE
Yes, we’ll go on a huge vacation!

We can go to Hawaii!

Kyle awkwardly stands over Adam, trying to act normal.
 




 


KYLE
Hey man? What’s up?...I’m afraid to touch you, but um--

Adam sticks out his pinkie which Kyle gently fist bumps.

KYLE
Boom. You look really good.

ADAM
I’m high as a motherfucka.

Kyle looks at Diane with a guilty expression.

KYLE
Um...we don’t do that.


INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

Adam lies in bed. His eyes open, staring at the ceiling. It’s quiet. Peaceful. Katherine knocks on the door and walks in. Adam speaks; woozy from the morphine, and very weak:

ADAM
It’s you.

KATHERINE
It is me.

She stands next to the bed.

KATHERINE
How are you feeling?

ADAM
Grrreat. I love morphine...What

time is it?

KATHERINE
It’s eight o’clock. I was just working late, so I thought I’d stop by.

ADAM
(wide smile)
Working late - you got a new

patient?

KATHERINE
I got a few new patients, actually.

ADAM
That’s good.
 



 


Adam smiles. Looks into her eyes for a long beat.

ADAM
I’d like to make you pancakes some time.

KATHERINE
That’s very nice, Adam.

ADAM
(dead serious)

You’re going to like them.

Katherine laughs. She sits next to him on the bed, and takes hold of his hand. Unlike her previous attempts, this time her grip is perfect. Adam notices.

ADAM
I’m peeing right now.

KATHERINE
I’m not going to look.


We stay on Adam and Katherine looking into each other’s eyes as Katherine moves her hand down his arm, finally clasping his hand in hers.


I/E. ADAM’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - EVENING

CLOSE-UP ON: WOUND

ANGLE ON: Kyle, staring at the wound with trepidation, absolutely disgusted.

KYLE
Ugh, it’s gross! Oh God - I keep
looking back at it thinking it’s

going to be less gross.

The wound is revealed to be on Adam’s back. Adam -- hair slowly beginning to grow back, looking much healthier, relaxed -- looks back at Kyle.

ADAM
Can we just get it over with? Come on.

KYLE
Your mom does this?

ADAM
She does it all the time.
 



 


KYLE
This is like some “Saw” shit.

ADAM
(unaffected)

Your words are so comforting.

KYLE
I’m just gonna do it, I’m gonna act like it’s nothing.

Kyle puts a gob of antibiotic ointment on his finger and very tentatively reaches towards Adam’s back.

ADAM
I’m going to be really proud of

you.

KYLE
Ugh! I’m doing it. I’m inside you!

Adam looks over his shoulder, notices Kyle applying the ointment.

ADAM
Wait, wait, wait, is that your

finger?

KYLE
What?

ADAM
Is that your finger?

KYLE
(guilty)

No.

ADAM
There’s Q-Tips!

KYLE
I know, I know...

Kyle quickly applies some ointment on a Q-TIP.

ADAM
That was your finger, wasn’t it!

KYLE
Would it be bad if it was?

ADAM
Did you wash your hands?

KYLE
I used a Q-Tip the whole time,

don’t worry about it.

Kyle swabs the wound with the Q-Tip.

KYLE
This looks like Kuato from “Total

Recall”.

Adam grabs his back to imitate Kuato.

ADAM
The oxygen!

KYLE
(disgusted)

No! Don’t do that! Ugh!

Kyle feebly applies the DRESSING on Adam’s wound.

ADAM
Can we get this going? It’s seven
thirty. Come on, put on the

bandage.

Kyle gingerly applies the bandage whilst turning his head. Wound now covered, Kyle looks self-assured -- it’s a pretty shoddy job.

KYLE
And you, are ready for your date!

Adam gingerly stands and buttons up his shirt. He walks over and looks in the mirror. He rubs his short hair in contemplation.

ADAM
It’s crazy. I look pretty good.

KYLE
I’d fuck you.

ADAM
(smiles)

Thanks.

The DOORBELL rings. Adam looks at Kyle, a bit nervous.

KYLE (CONT’D)
(excited)
Who could that be? Go answer it,

go!

Adam takes a deep breath and opens the front door. He lights up when he sees KATHERINE standing in front of him. She’s holding a PIZZA.

ADAM
Hey.

KATHERINE
Hi.

ADAM
You look nice.

KATHERINE
Thanks.
(awkward beat)

You too. You look super nice.

ADAM
(smiles)

You want to come in?

KATHERINE
Yeah.

They walk inside.

KATHERINE
Look at you, walking up a storm.

Kyle clears his throat and waves meekly from the corner.

ADAM
You remember Kyle...

KYLE
Good to see you...I see you brought a pizza, which is good because I haven’t fed him all day. I just changed the dressing on his wound. There’s Vicodin in the bathroom if you need it; I know people take it recreationally but he actually needs it for his aches--

Adam stares at Kyle, blankly. Katherine looks to Adam, unsure how to react.

KATHERINE
(dead serious)

Are there channels he can’t watch?

Katherine cracks a smile. Kyle beams.

KYLE
(to Adam)
That’s funny.
(to Katherine)
So, you’re doing your doctorate I

hear? That’s--

Adam opens the door and ushers Kyle out.

ADAM
Dude, you’re awesome.

KYLE
Alright!

Kyle moves toward the door and whispers to Adam-

KYLE (CONT’D)
She’s cool.

Adam smiles, and closes the door on Kyle. Adam then turns around and looks at Katherine.

KATHERINE
So.

ADAM
So.

KATHERINE
(smiles)

Now what?

A beat as Adam thinks, then flashes a smile.

MUSIC SWELLS as we go...
