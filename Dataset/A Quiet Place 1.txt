EXT. HILLTOP - DAY

The hilltop is lined with corn. Golden and brown. Shimmering in the morning heat.

There’s a structure in the distance...


EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY

A FARMHOUSE built from old lumber. There’s no cattle or livestock in sight. Unusual for this fertile land.


INT. FARMHOUSE, DEN - DAY

APRIL (8) gazes out the window pane. Nervous, eager, sweet.

She has a HEARING AID in one ear.

She’s focused on a TOOL SHED one hundred feet away, isolated under a crooked apple tree.

Her eyes drift from the shed to her older brother WILL (10) who stands outside. He sticks his tongue out. She ignores him. This is their dynamic.


EXT. SHED - DAY

April picks weeds outside the shed. She pockets a PURPLE IRIS and wipes dirt on her sweater.

Will plays nearby with a GOLDEN RETRIEVER. It wears a MUZZLE.


EXT. DRIVEWAY - DAY

April empties the weeds into a tin TRASH CAN. She places the lid back on the trash slowly, ensuring that it doesn’t make even the slightest sound.


EXT. PORCH - DAY

Will approaches the front door. The retriever follows closely behind. He motions for the dog to “stay”.

Then slips a pair of disposable SHOE COVERS over his feet before entering.
 
2.


INT. FARMHOUSE, BEDROOM - DAY

Will’s mother, MIA (30s), holds a RED CRAYON to her lips. She has lovely green eyes and auburn hair. She balances a LAUNDRY BASKET next to her PREGNANT BELLY.

She stands before a CALENDAR on the wall, charting each day of her pregnancy. She crosses off another day and hands the crayon back to --

Will, who colors in a NEW DRAWING. His hands dig loudly through a tin of crayons.

Mia waves her finger. Will freezes, reprimanded for the hundredth time.

He reaches under his parent’s bed for a pair of oversized WINTER GLOVES. He places the gloves over each hand, then quietly resumes his search.


INT. FARMHOUSE, HALL - DAY

Mia walks past April and collects her dirt-stained sweater into the laundry basket.


INT. FARMHOUSE, LAUNDRY ROOM - DAY

We follow Mia to the WASHER AND DRYER. The machines have been unplugged.

She empties the basket into the washer. Adds water and soap.

Lightly stirs the clothes with her hands.

Mia stops momentarily. The purple iris floats in the water.

An idea strikes her - she leans over to a MARKER BOARD labeled BABY NAMES and adds IRIS to the list.

A hand cuts the frame, immediately crossing out IRIS.

JOHN (40s), the patriarch of the family, shakes his head. An MP3 PLAYER plays MUSIC in his headphones that we can’t hear.

John points to another name on the list: HOLLY. Mia playfully purses her lips. He places a comforting hand over her bump.

John puts one of his EARBUDS into her ear. Our world is filled with MUSIC - maybe a song from when they first met.
 
3.


INT. FARMHOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY

John & Mia slow-dance through the living room, very much in love after all these years.

They both wear SHOE COVERS on their feet. And as they move together about the house, a theme materializes in the background: Every inch of wall and floor has been painstakingly covered with THICK PADDING. Sometimes FOAM, sometimes WOOL INSULATION. Too ugly to be an aesthetic choice. Must be product of necessity.


INT. FARMHOUSE, DINING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

Mia sets the table. All of their plates and cutlery are plastic. She gestures to John to gather the children for dinner.


INT. FARMHOUSE, UPSTAIRS - LATE AFTERNOON

John tops the stairs. He opens a DOOR, labeled “Will” in stenciled letters.

Will sits at his desk, finishing his drawing. John MIMES an eating motion. Will acknowledges.

John moves on to the SECOND DOOR, labeled “April” in a flower-patterned alphabet. Peeks his head inside...

It’s empty.

John moves further down the hall to a THIRD DOOR. No letters on this one - only a sun-faded patch, suggesting a name was once removed.

He hesitates before opening the door --


INT. FARMHOUSE, BEDROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

April sits on a stripped MATTRESS FRAME in a sparsely decorated room. Looks like someone used to live here long ago. She closes the DIARY she’s writing in, annoyed by the intrusion.

John MIMES the eating motion and extends his hand, encouraging her to join.

April rises from the bed and approaches, her arm outstretched as if she’ll grab John’s hand BUT --

APRIL CLOSES THE DOOR IN HIS FACE.
 
4.


INT. FARMHOUSE, DINING ROOM - EVENING

The rim of the sun sets outside, casting an orange glow over the dinner table.

The family finishes their supper. Mia clears the table.

John unfolds a MONOPOLY game board as April finally joins from upstairs. She takes the furthest seat from John.

April’s mood changes as she tussles with Will over who gets to roll first.

They play the game mostly with hand gestures, never speaking a word. They roll the DICE on a soft blanket so that it doesn’t make a sound.

Will is five spaces away from landing on April’s BOARDWALK.

He silently prays for a miracle.

Will rolls a... five.

He throws up his hands in protest.

April lets out a GIGGLE. The first sound we’ve heard this whole time --

JOHN’S EYES WIDEN. APRIL COVERS HER MOUTH.

EVERYONE GETS DEADLY STILL. AFRAID.

AND THEN WE HEAR IT.

A SCREAM IN THE DISTANCE. IT IS NOT HUMAN.

The family exchanges worried glances.

John edges over to the window, watching the horizon for any sign of movement. Nothing.

THEN THE SCREAM SLOWLY STARTS TO MOVE AWAY.

April removes her hand from her mouth.

Everyone starts to relax.

They go back to playing Monopoly in silence.


TITLE: A QUIET PLACE
 
5.


EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

The farmhouse sits in moonlight. A thin fog hovers just above the ground. All the lights are off.

The family dog is tied outside. It stirs awake. Focuses on the wall of corn lining the backyard.

Tries to bark through the MUZZLE but can’t.


EXT. CORN FIELD - NIGHT

There are no crickets or insects of any kind. Just an unnatural silence that hangs in the air.

AND THEN SOMETHING MOVES.

STALKS OF CORN WHIP AND BEND AS A LARGE FORM MANEUVERS

THROUGH THE CROPS...


EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAWN

Morning. The yard is serene and still. A heavy layer of frost covers the grass.


INT. FARMHOUSE, HALL - MORNING

April’s tiny face peeks out into the hall. She wipes the sleep from her eyes.


INT. FARMHOUSE, BATHROOM - MORNING

April lifts the toilet seat. There’s no water inside the bowl, just a red BIOHAZARD BAG curled around the rim.

She pees into the bag and her face goes from agony to relief.


INT. FARMHOUSE, BASEMENT - MORNING

April descends the BASEMENT STAIRS with the biohazard bag.

There is a NAIL sticking up about ten steps down, and if

someone were to step on it...

...it would REALLY, REALLY HURT.

APRIL’S FOOT COMES DOWN ON THE NAIL, but just misses it.
 
6.


She disposes of the biohazard bag in a DEEP HOLE cut into the basement floor. She heads back to the stairs, but something stops her...

An old WORKBENCH cluttered with family PHOTOS from ages ago.

April glances at a POLAROID of a TEENAGE GIRL: braces, dark eyes, beautiful. She’s hugging April. They’re both laughing.

The Polaroid seems to be attached to a PAINFUL MEMORY. And like everything in this basement, it has the look of something that was abandoned long ago.

A HAND TOUCHES APRIL’S SHOULDER.

John is standing behind his daughter. April doesn’t look over. Doesn’t react.

If we hadn’t noticed before, we realize now that there is an enormous amount of tension between them.

April’s face starts to quiver. Tears filling her eyes. She pushes her father’s hand away and leaves.

John opens his mouth as if to say something, but of course...

he can’t.


EXT. VALLEY - MORNING

John has a LARGE DUFFLE slung around his shoulder. He leads Will down a steep trail into a lake valley.

As they walk, we may or may not notice how they always:

1)	Avoid dry leaves and sticks
2)	Walk heel to toe
3)	Distribute their weight evenly
4)	Keep their arms close to their sides
5)	Breathe steadily

6)	Match the cadence of each other’s gait


EXT. LAKE - MORNING

Will sits into a small ROW-BOAT with no paddles. He hides his trembling hands. Doesn’t want his father to know he’s scared.

John sits behind him and gazes at the placid water.

A layer of RED ALGAE covers the entire basin. It is thick and milky along the shore, where the SKELETONS of cows, horses, and fish waste away.
 
7.


There’s a long ROPE that extends from one side of the lake to the other. It’s been secured to a post on each end and pulled taught, hanging no more than a few inches above the surface.

The men begin pulling themselves along the rope, slowly at first; careful not to disrupt or splash the water in any way.

Their boat glides across the calm lake, gaining momentum, heading to a SMALL GROVE OF TREES on the other side.

EXT. WELL - MORNING

Under the trees rests a WATER WELL made of laid stones.

John shines a MINI-FLASHLIGHT into the well. The beam fades into darkness, unable to reach the bottom.

John begins pulling a bungee cable that’s looped through a pulley system.

Sixty feet below, a LEATHER BUCKET envelopes a gallon of water, and as the bungee is pulled, the leather cinches itself closed, trapping any leaking water.

Will opens the duffle and removes four COLLAPSIBLE WATER CONTAINERS.

They begin the process of painstakingly filling each of the containers with water from the well.


EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY

April is lying outside the farmhouse writing in her DIARY.

Her HEARING AID is removed.

She flips the page and stifles a scream. Inside is a DRAWING.

A DARK RED CREATURE SCRIBBLED IN CRAYON. ANIMAL, YET OTHERWORLDLY. BLOOD POOLED AROUND ITS LEGS.

Her brother smirks as he hauls two WATER CONTAINERS across the yard. April is not amused by Will’s prank. She plugs her HEARING AID back into her ear.


INT. FARMHOUSE, DEN - DAY

Mia crosses off another day on her CALENDAR. We see that she’s still several weeks out from her DUE DATE.

She glances outside the window - sees the boys heading toward the SHED with the WELL WATER.
 
8.


EXT. PORCH - DAY

Mia wanders outside to the back porch. Her eyes narrow.

THE DOG IS GONE. THE END OF THE LEASH FRAYED, AS IF TORN.


INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY

Mia searches everywhere for the dog. An impossible task when you can’t hear your pet, and your pet can’t hear you.


INT. FARMHOUSE, UPSTAIRS - DAY

Mia stops at the top of the stairs. She cringes, feels a small pang in her stomach. It passes.


EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY

Outside, April crumples up the drawing. Her eyes trained on the SHED as its doors sway in the wind. She approaches.

INT. SHED - DAY

April’s tiny hands open the large shed doors and we see inside for the first time:

In the center is a CRIB with a MOBILE hanging over it. The surrounding walls are built like a bomb shelter of sorts - heavily reinforced with sound dampening materials. Much like the farmhouse, but more extreme.

...they’ve been preparing for the baby’s arrival for months.


INT. FARMHOUSE, CHILDREN’S BEDROOM - DAY

Mia gets down on all fours and peers under April’s bed. She sees something that puzzles her. Takes a moment to register.

The POLAROID OF THE TEENAGE GIRL from the basement is buried under a pile of clothes. Mia examines it for a moment, then places it back.

Mia moves to the hall. She staggers a little. Feels dizzy.

INT. FARMHOUSE, HALL - DAY

Mia staggers toward the bathroom. Every step takes extraordinary effort.


INT. SHED - LATER

John and Will hang each sheet from the pile. One by one. The process is SLOW and DILIGENT, with no room for error.

April teases Will while he works. He pushes her away. A little too hard. She frowns, her feelings hurt.


INT. FARMHOUSE, BATHROOM - DAY

Mia sits in a BATH TUB. Her face red. Doing everything she can to not make a sound. Fighting an immense amount of pain.

INT. SHED - LATER STILL

John stands on a LADDER, fastening a sheet to the ceiling.

About half the stack has been put up.

When no one is looking, April pulls one of the sheets off the wall. She smiles to herself, almost wants to get caught, but no one sees her.


INT. FARMHOUSE, BATHROOM - DAY

Mia’s contractions increase.


INT. SHED - EVEN LATER

The sun is lower in the sky. Much progress has been made on the walls and ceiling, which are now 60% covered in sound proofing.

April wanders past THREE BUNKS: one for John & Mia, one for Will, and one for herself. April’s bunk is half-decorated with STICKERS and a Wizard of Oz SCARECROW plush toy.

April grabs a PILLOW from her bed. Looks to her brother mischievously.


INT. FARMHOUSE, BATHROOM - AFTERNOON Mia grips the side of the tub as --
 
11.


INT. SHED - AFTERNOON

April SMACKS Will with the pillow. He’s in no mood. He fights back. John breaks them up, scolds April. Points at his daughter, motioning for her to leave.

April sulks away, angry. Steps outside the shed and STOPS.

She sees the RED FLOOD LIGHTS ARE ON. She panics, runs back to the shed and grabs her father. He starts to get scared when he realizes how scared she is.


EXT. FARMHOUSE - AFTERNOON

John runs across the lawn as fast as he can. Throws the front door open. No time for shoe covers.


INT. FARMHOUSE, UPSTAIRS - AFTERNOON Sprints up the stairs.

INT. FARMHOUSE, BATHROOM - AFTERNOON

Finds his wife in the bathtub. She’s in labor.


EXT. SHED - AFTERNOON

Will and April run off in the opposite direction of the farmhouse. It’s as if they’ve been rehearsing for this moment for months.


EXT. WOODS - AFTERNOON

They enter a small patch of forest. Fast as they can.


EXT. WOODS, PATH - AFTERNOON

April trips and falls. Will doesn’t stop to help her.


INT. WOODS, HORSE STALL - AFTERNOON

Will lunges into an empty horse stall. He tips over a TOOL BOX and grabs a pack of MATCHES.
 
12.


INT. FARMHOUSE, BATHROOM - AFTERNOON

Mia’s face is flush and sweaty. A pool of blood surrounds

her. She breathes heavy as...

A NEWBORN BABY BEGINS TO CRY --


EXT. WOODS, PATH - AFTERNOON

--	April gets very still. She turns up the VOLUME on her hearing aid.

Just faintly, through the high frequency static, we hear the baby CRYING in the distance.

April stifles her breathing.

The sound of SOMETHING else continues breathing behind her.

OUT OF FOCUS, JUST TEN FEET AWAY, WE SEE IT MOVE SLOWLY TOWARDS THE SOUNDS.


INT. FARMHOUSE, UPSTAIRS - AFTERNOON

Mia takes the crying baby in her arms. She covers it with a FLEECE BLANKET, trying to dampen the cries.

John looks out the window at the shed. Wondering how to get there safely.

AND THAT’S WHEN THEY HEAR THE FLOORBOARDS CREAKING DOWNSTAIRS. SOMETHING IS INSIDE THE HOUSE WITH THEM.

Tears stream down Mia’s face. A look that says, “It’s too late. We’re already dead.”


EXT. WOODS, TRACTOR - AFTERNOON

Will arrives at his destination. Out of breath and sweating. He reaches under a RUSTED-OUT TRACTOR, searching for something. His hand sweeps back and forth...

...we see a BLACK FUSE just barely out of reach. His fingers getting

closer

closer

CLOSER!
 
13.


INT. FARMHOUSE, UPSTAIRS - AFTERNOON

The FOOTSTEPS creep up the stairs. Nails scrape and click against the wood. They don’t sound human.


EXT. WOODS, TRACTOR - AFTERNOON

Will reaches as far as he possibly can...

...grabs the FUSE and LIGHTS IT. It takes. The spark disappears under the tractor.

Will immediately starts running back to the house.


INT. FARMHOUSE, UPSTAIRS - AFTERNOON

The FOOTSTEPS stop at the top of the stairs. We can hear the creature BREATHING now. Wheezy and hollow, like air slowly being sucked through a straw.

Mia and John stand frozen, too afraid to move. They are staring at THE SILHOUETTE OF A NIGHTMARE...

IT STANDS ON FOUR LEGS, HUNCHED LOW, PREDATORY AND DANGEROUS.

ITS SKIN DEEP DARK RED - THE COLOR OF DRIED BLOOD.

THERE ARE NO EYES ON THE MONSTER’S FACE. AND AS IT SAUNTERS TOWARD JOHN AND MIA, WE REALIZE IT CANNOT SEE THEM. IT SIMPLY HEARS THE BABY’S MUFFLED CRIES.

THE CREATURE’S JAW UNHINGES, AND THEN --

-- BA-BOOM!!


EXT. CORN FIELD - AFTERNOON

FIREWORKS EXPLODE over the crops.

April looks up, startled at first. Then smiles, Will pulled it off!


INT. FARMHOUSE, UPSTAIRS - AFTERNOON

The creature retreats downstairs, pursuing the loud noises outside.
 
14.


EXT. WOODS, PATH - AFTERNOON

Will races back towards the farmhouse. Fireworks igniting in the background as he runs. It would be beautiful if it weren’t so terrifying.


EXT. CORN FIELD, WEATHER VANE - AFTERNOON

Deep in the corn field, April kneels at the base of an iron WEATHER VANE that points back toward the farmhouse.

She plugs a RED CABLE into the back of a SPEAKER BOX and...

BOOM! A small electrical explosion knocks her unconscious.


EXT. PORCH - AFTERNOON

Mia and John sneak the newborn out the back.

Mia moves in slow, pained steps. She struggles to stand on two legs, but musters all her courage to continue.

John motions for Mia to make a run for the shed. He signals a silent countdown with his fingers...

...three


...two


...one


MIA RUNS FOR IT.


EXT. GRASS FIELD - AFTERNOON

Will peels away a patch of TALL GRASS, revealing a GREY BOX.

He flips a switch on the box.

A RED LIGHT turns on and --


INT. SHED - AFTERNOON

-- a series of MEDICAL MACHINES roar to life inside the shed.

Mia attaches a BREATHING MASK to the infant’s face and places it in the crib, carefully draping blankets over the baby.
 
15.







INT. FARMHOUSE, DEN - AFTERNOON

John sneaks through the den. Grabs his MP3 PLAYER. Unplugs the HEADPHONES.


INT. SHED - AFTERNOON

Will slips into the shed and DEAD BOLTS one door. Leaves the

second open...


EXT. FARMHOUSE - AFTERNOON

John comes out the front door --

THE MONSTER STANDS BETWEEN HIM AND THE SHED.

BETWEEN HIM AND HIS FAMILY.

John looks to his NEWBORN BABY.

His eyes well with joy and fear.

Mia tries to muffle the weeping infant.

The monster senses their presence, but can’t quite place their exact location.

John walks slowly but urgently to the shed, as --

THE WIND STARTS BLOWING.

THE LEAVES OF THE TREES BEND AND RATTLE.

IT DISGUISES THE SOUNDS OF JOHN’S FOOTSTEPS.

JOHN CLOSES HIS EYES.

FOCUSING ALL OF HIS ENERGY.

DOING HIS BEST TO NOT MAKE A SINGLE SOUND.

THIS IS THE LONGEST WALK OF HIS LIFE.

John is 30 feet away from the shed

20 feet away

10 feet

5

SNAP

John looks down in horror. A BROKEN TWIG under his foot.

The creature whips around. Rears up.

JOHN RUNS FOR IT --

THE MONSTER SCREAMS --


INT. SHED - AFTERNOON

MIA PULLS JOHN INSIDE. JUST BEFORE THE MONSTER LUNGES, WILL SLAMS THE DOOR CLOSED. DEAD BOLTS THE LOCK.

JOHN RUNS TO THE BACK OF THE SHED, PLUGS THE MP3 PLAYER INTO THE WALL, FLIPS A SWITCH --


EXT. GRASS FIELD - AFTERNOON

The light on the GREY BOX turns GREEN, and then we hear...

MUSIC


EXT. CORN FIELD, WEATHER VANE - AFTERNOON

...coming from the SPEAKER BOX at the base of the weather vane.


EXT. SHED - AFTERNOON

The creature retreats from the shed toward the sounds.


EXT. HILLTOP - AFTERNOON

High above rolling hills under day-blue sky. The farmhouse just a dot on the horizon.

MUSIC reverberates off the walls of the empty valley.

We hear a HORRIFYING ROAR, and then just as soon as it started, the music goes SILENT.

...

...

...

Now just wind.
 
22.


Wind pulsing through dry corn stalks.

The rustles and whispers of dead silence.


INT. SHED - AFTERNOON

The FAMILY holds each other. Emotional and raw.

John pulls away from their tight embrace, slowly realizing...

HIS DAUGHTER IS NOT WITH THEM.

John runs to the door but it’s JAMMED.

He pushes as hard as he can. LOUDLY shoving the padded frame.

Just when the door is about to BURST, Mia grabs John. She

pulls him back as the MONSTROUS FORM returns outside...

LISTENING AND WAITING

FOR EVEN THE

FAINTEST

LITTLE

SOUND

FADE TO:


DARKNESS

A bird CHIRPS. Benign at first, growing louder. A single WARBLE. Then many. We see --

THOUSANDS OF CROWS. Filling the screen with their dimension and sound. Billowing like an OMINOUS BLACK CLOUD over --

Recently planted CROPS. The crows descend upon fresh SEEDS. Annihilating the soil. Lightening quick glimpses of --

A Young April. Before she had a HEARING AID. She smiles --

Her father John places a SCARECROW in the field. He wipes sweat from his forehead. We see --

The TEENAGE GIRL FROM THE POLAROID. She picks April up into her arms --
 
23.

APRIL (V.O.)
How come you and daddy don’t talk

anymore?

We’re not sure if this is DREAM, or MEMORY, or SOMETHING ELSE entirely, and before we can comprehend --

A HUGE CONCUSSIVE BLAST!!!

SECOND ACT:


EXT. CORN FIELD, WEATHER VANE - NIGHT April’s eyes snap open.

She climbs out from under a pile of dead corn husks.

She is alone. Long deep shadows fall in the maze of corn that surrounds her. Every direction looks exactly the same. An eerie chill permeates the cold night air.

Nearby, we see the monster’s warpath. The SPEAKER BOX is TORN TO SHREDS. Wires and circuits everywhere.

April lifts what’s left of the WEATHER VANE. At one time it pointed right back at the farmhouse. But now...?

She aims it FORWARD

...doesn’t seem right...

She aims it LEFT

...that’s not it....

She aims it BACKWARDS

...oh no...

April is completely lost.


INT. SHED - NIGHT

Mia is asleep next to Will. The newborn lies on her chest.

John is kneeled on the other side of the small shed.

His eyes trained on the wall...

Peering through the razor-thin slats...

THE SHADOW MOVES.

John lets out a GASP. His breath kicks up a tiny cloud of dust.

THE SHADOW STOPS MOVING.

John is frozen like a statue. His mouth open a little.

He stays like that for a long time.

John carefully moves back to the wall. He looks through the slats once more...

The DARK SHAPE has vanished from view.

John wipes sweat from his forehead. The silence grows heavy, and then --

THERE’S SUDDEN MOVEMENT OUTSIDE. THE SOUND OF RUSTLING GRASS.

John jerks back, startled. Hits his head on a tie-beam, creating the slightest THWAP and --

WE HEAR A HORRIBLE HIGH-PITCHED SHRIEK IN RESPONSE, WHALING LOUD EVEN THROUGH FOURTEEN INCHES OF REINFORCED SOUND PROOF PADDING and then BOOOOOOOOM the far wall shakes as a clawed hand comes down hard from outside.

The entire FAMILY jolts awake.


EXT. CORN FIELD - NIGHT

April’s shoulders graze stalks of leaves as she moves toward the figure, whose stark form remains threateningly still.

She’s not exhaling.

Not even a breath.

She takes the last few steps to the figure.

She waves at him.

No response.

His eyes sunken and dark. His body rocks back and forth, as if agitated.

April reaches for him.

She pulls a piece of STRAW from the outline of a SCARECROW.

She blinks. Makes up her mind. That’s where she’s headed.

April climbs down to the dismantled SCARECROW.

Her arms and legs feel heavy. She looks like a stranger in her oversized attire. Her mind starts to drift.

Just then...

Nearby...

Only a few yards away...

A CROW CAWS!

April looks up, startled.

The CAWING continues all around her. Or is it in her mind?

We hear a displaced VOICE, feminine and soft...

VOICE (V.O.)
Can you tell Dad, that I’m not a

child anymore...


FLASHBACK: EXT. CORN FIELD, SCARECROW - DAY

The voice belongs to April’s sister, IRIS, f.k.a. teenager from the Polaroid. She’s in a heated argument with John.

IRIS
...and that I can go out with my

friends whenever I want.

Young April relays to John as if he didn’t hear Iris.

APRIL	JOHN
Iris says, “She’s not a child	Can you tell your sister that
anymore, and can go out --”	as long as she keeps acting
like a child, she’s going to

be treated like a child.
 

APRIL

Dad says, “As long as you act like a child --”
 


IRIS

Tell dad that he’s the one acting like a child, and that it’s ridiculous that he won’t talk to me because I forgot to cover the seeds last week.

She fights her feelings at first, but eventually surrenders to the sadness...

SHE WEEPS.

A DEEP MOURNING THAT QUIETLY GROWS IN INTENSITY --

EXPLODING INTO --

A SOFT WHIMPER --

JUST AS --

She cups her hand over her mouth.

Almost forgot how dangerous it is to cry.

April composes herself.

She begins her long journey to the GRAIN SILO.


EXT. SHED, ROOF - DAWN

John looks out from the SKYLIGHT HATCH.

The sun is just starting to climb over the horizon. Its warm light spilling down onto the field of crops, giving the corn a yellow glow.

John carefully hoists himself onto the SHED ROOF. He scans the yard for any sign of movement.

Nothing.

The yard appears completely EMPTY.

John moves back to the hatch and gives Will a thumbs up.

Will climbs onto the shed roof.

The men close the hatch.

John carefully lowers himself over the rim of the roof. His hands clinging precariously to LOOSE SHINGLE.

He doesn’t see the STAPLE that snags his shirt, so much as he hears it...

...the fabric beginning to RIP...

John tries to steady himself.
 
33.


But his fingers are slipping on the rough surface, all the way to the edge, dangling there, suspended ten feet off the ground. The more he slips, the LOUDER the shirt gets.

Will tries to un-snag the shirt from the staple, but it only makes MORE NOISE. To us it’s no louder than a whisper - but to the monster, it could be DEAFENING.

John’s hands begin to shake. His face turns red. He’s using all of his strength not to shift further down.

Desperate, Will pulls off one of the rotted shingle TILES and uses the jagged corner to cut the speared fabric. It works!

The shirt goes slack.

Just as the SHINGLES are about to give, John releases his grip and falls silently to the ground.

But it’s too late --

AN ENTIRE ROW OF TILES COMES SLIDING DOWN THE ROOF AFTER HIM.

John catches each tile. One by one. Just barely.

John and Will look at each other.

That was close.


EXT. CORN FIELD - MORNING

John and Will walk in opposite directions through the corn field.


EXT. VALLEY - MORNING

Will has the LARGE DUFFLE slung around his shoulder. It’s almost twice his size.

He nervously maneuvers the steep trail that leads into the LAKE VALLEY. It’s the first time he has ever done this alone.

INT. SHED - MORNING

Inside the shed, Mia watches her sleeping newborn hold the Monopoly DICE in its tiny hand.

April shucks an EAR OF CORN and bites into it. It’s raw, but nourishing. She takes an even bigger bite...

...SPITS IT OUT. Realizes the maize is INFESTED WITH WORMS.

April tosses the sweet corn.

It lands with a THUD.

JUST THEN WE HEAR AN IDENTICAL THUD BEHIND HER!

That’s odd...

April turns up the VOLUME on her hearing aid.

She hears stalks of corn MOVING.

THE CREATURE...

April hides under a PATCH OF OVERGROWN WEEDS.

We hear the RUSTLING SOUNDS approaching...

they are so faint

you almost

can’t even

hear them

AND THEN --

JOHN APPEARS FROM THE WALL OF CROPS.

He walks right past his daughter, who remains motionless, hidden under leaves and grass.

Both father and daughter, completely unaware of how close they were to finding each other.


INT. SHED - DAY

Mia has REPAIRED the shed doors. She cautiously swings them open. Glances at the FARMHOUSE.

Checks to make sure the baby is still asleep, then slips out the door.
Impossible to see anything clearly.

Maybe it’s nothing.

Don’t be afraid.

There.

Is.

Nothing.

Under.

Your.

Boat.

Will steadies his SHAKING HANDS, summoning all of his courage, as he pulls himself along the ROPE.


INT. FARMHOUSE, UPSTAIRS - DAY

Mia’s arms are full of FOOD. She’s about to leave for the SHED, when --


INT. FARMHOUSE, BEDROOM - DAY

-- something grabs her attention.

The POLAROID OF APRIL’S SISTER, IRIS, poking out from under the bed.


EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY

Now holding the POLAROID and FOOD, Mia makes her way back to the SHED.

Wait, the DOORS are open....

WIDE OPEN...

BOTH SHED DOORS WIDE FUCKING OPEN NO NO NO NO NO NO

THE WORST IMAGINABLE

THING HAS HAPPENED

THE CREATURE IS INSIDE THE SHED.

Mia goes white.

Looks to her BABY...

The infant is about to WAKE UP!

THE BABY WIGGLES. YAWNS INTO ITS BREATHING MASK.

The monster doesn’t move. It has no idea Mia is here. In fact, it probably has no idea where “here” even is. But the second it figures it out, it’s ALL GOING TO BE OVER.

Mia removes her shoes. Tip-toes to the crib. One foot precisely placed in front of the other. Lifts her newborn.

THE MONSTER STIRS, SENSING SOMETHING.

Mia carries her baby out of the shed, mouthing “Shhhhh” the whole way, as the baby’s eyes

...BLINK OPEN!


INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY

Mia rushes the waking baby into the house.


INT. FARMHOUSE, DEN - DAY

Through the den.


INT. FARMHOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY

Through the living room.


INT. BASEMENT - DAY

Into the basement.

Down the stairs.

MIA STEPS ON THE NAIL!!!!!!!!!!

STABBING ALL THE WAY THROUGH TENDON AND MUSCLE.

MIA RECOILS.

WRITHES IN PAIN.

She looks ahead. And then, as if to confirm her findings, something appears on the far horizon...

BLACK SMOKE RISING OVER THE CROPS --


EXT. GRAVEL ROAD - DAY

--	we find John fanning a small FIRE. He has made a SMOKE SIGNAL for April.


EXT. SILO, ROOF - DAY

Relief washes over April’s face. She recognizes the pattern in the smoke. Knows it’s her father.

She dismantles her sundial. Collects the BUTTONS into her pocket.

Takes a HARD STEP on the platform and --

THE RUSTED METAL BUCKLES --

SUDDEN AND EXPLOSIVE --

AS SHE FALLS INTO THE SILO --

AND LETS OUT A SCREAM!!!


INT. FARMHOUSE, BASEMENT - DAY

--	which ECHOES ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE DEAD AIR TO THE FARMHOUSE.

Mia hears the FOOTSTEPS above her suddenly retreat from the house.

She looks out the window in time to glimpse the creature running off into the crops.

Mia grabs the baby and hobbles back to the shed.


EXT. GRAVEL ROAD - DAY

John puts out the FIRE. Notices CORN STALKS crackling with movement.
 
43.


EXT. WELL - DAY

Will, who is now retrieving WATER out of the well, hears the monster’s ROAR reverberate all around him.


INT. SILO - DAY

April lands on her stomach with a TREMENDOUS SLAP on the layer of ROTTEN GRAIN that fills this structure.

It is 140°F inside the steel silo. And there are MAGGOTS and WORMS everywhere.

April looks up to the broken platform.

She can almost reach it.

April tries to stand.

BUT HER ANKLES BEGIN TO SINK.

THE GRAIN IS LIKE QUICK SAND.

THE MORE SHE MOVES, THE DEEPER SHE DROWNS.

UNTIL HER ENTIRE BODY IS SUBMERGED.

AND WE CAN NO LONGER SEE HER FACE.

THE 80,000 BUSHEL GRAIN BIN DEVOURS APRIL ALIVE.

Five seconds. That is how quickly someone can become engulfed in flowing grain and unable to get out.

Thirty seconds. That is how quickly someone can be completely submerged in flowing grain and suffocate.

Zero. That is how many people can survive being buried under grain without air for a few minutes.


EXT. GRAVEL ROAD - AFTERNOON

John sprints after the movement in the crops.


INT. SILO - AFTERNOON

April’s body thrashes in the dark. Fleeting trickles of light come through as the grain stirs, but it’s mostly BLACK.

April takes huge desperate breaths. She tries to swim to the top. The grain wraps her body tighter with every movement.
 
44.


SOUNDS OF THE OUTSIDE WORLD START TO FADE AWAY

A tiny shaft of light punches through just long enough for us to glimpse WORMS crawling into April’s hair and clothes.

...the least of her problems.

Because she’s starting to die. There’s no oxygen left to breathe. Her esophagus is only gulping down heavy grain.

All we hear now is the SOFT LULL OF ASPHYXIATION. It sounds like marbles grinding in a glass jar.

BOOOOOM!!

Pounding.

BOOOOOM!!

Outside. On the walls.

BOOOOOM!!

Again. The pounding grows louder and more intense. It travels through the grain like a distorted sonic --

BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!!!!!!!

The wall RUPTURES below. Grain starts spilling outside. April is carried with the current, edging closer and closer to the puncture hole. Closer and closer to DAYLIGHT.

Someone has saved her. Maybe Will? Maybe her father?

That’s when April hears the HISSING sound behind her head...

NOT SOMEONE. SOMETHING.

She pulls at the grain, clawing/thrashing, flailing her arms and legs, moving to the daylight as fast as she can, and we see --


EXT. SILO - LATE AFTERNOON

--	thousands of yellow beads pouring out of ripped steel at the base of the silo, creating a hazy diffusion in the air.

April spills into the golden fog.

SHE RUNS FOR IT.

We hear the familiar sound of RUSHING WATER ahead

IRIS
I think I like it better when you

don’t say anything to me.

Iris storms out of the room. A DOOR SLAMS down the hall.

John sits in stunned silence.

JOHN
I don’t know what’s gotten into

her.

MIA

You act like she doesn’t exist.

John’s confused. He was expecting Mia to take his side.

MIA

You don’t talk to her anymore. You don’t tell her you love her.

JOHN

She knows I love her.

MIA

She needs to hear you say it.


FLASHBACK: INT. FARMHOUSE, IRIS’ ROOM - DAY

John sits next to Iris.

JOHN
I, um... Iris, I need to tell you

something.

Iris hides her face.

JOHN
I got this nasty crow problem,
and... and I’m worried if I can’t
solve it, we’re gonna lose an
entire harvest season.
(beat)

Do you think you could help me?

Iris looks at her dad.


FLASHBACK: INT. PICKUP - DAY
 

John drives his PICKUP TRUCK. Iris and April ride shotgun.
 
49.

IRIS
(excited)

It’s called a frequency generator. It shoots out weird noises at different pitches and amplitudes that humans can’t hear. It’ll drive the birds completely INSANE, they won’t know what hit’em. Much better than your lame scarecrow idea.

JOHN
(impressed)

Where’d you learn about this?

IRIS

Diplo.

JOHN

That an App or something? Iris looks at John like he’s from Mars.
JOHN
(winks)

Just playin’. DJ Diplo foreva.

Iris laughs. John laughs too. Feels good to be talking again.


FLASHBACK: EXT. ABE’S ELECTRONICS - DAY

John pays for the SIGNAL GENERATOR. Nearby, Iris and April play with an INSTAX POLAROID CAMERA.

APRIL

Dad, please?

IRIS

Please, Dad?

John buys the girls the Polaroid camera. Before they leave, John takes a PHOTO of Iris & April (the one we saw earlier).

FLASHBACK: INT. PICKUP - DAY

John drives the girls home. Something on his mind --

JOHN

Iris, uh, I wanted to say... well, and maybe I don’t say this enough. But I wanted to say
