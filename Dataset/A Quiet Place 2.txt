IRIS

Yeah?

John thinks about what Mia told him. How he doesn’t communicate with his daughter. How he never tells her he loves her. He thinks about how this could be that moment.

IRIS

What is it?

A traffic light up ahead turns yellow. John drives right through it.

JOHN

Nevermind. It’s nothing.

A SPEEDING VAN CUTS THROUGH THE INTERSECTION AND BROADSIDES THEIR TRUCK WITH TREMENDOUS MOMENTUM --

SUDDENLY AND WITHOUT WARNING:

THE TRUCK FLIPS

END OVER END

CRASHING TO A VIOLENT STOP

A silent beat. Smoke billows from the hood. Glass shards litter the street.

John crawls out of the overturned pickup.

JOHN

NO NO

He pulls April out of the wreckage.

JOHN

PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE

There’s a BODY forty feet away. She’s not moving. It’s Iris.

John stumbles to Iris. Picks her up. She’s dead.

JOHN

NO PLEASE NO IRIS PLEASE IRIS IRIS April stands behind John. Her ears are BLEEDING.

INT. FARMHOUSE, LAUNDRY ROOM - SUNRISE

John stops by the MARKER BOARD labeled BABY NAMES.

He crosses off HOLLY and re-writes IRIS.


EXT. VALLEY - MORNING

John travels through the valley. The backpack around his shoulders.


EXT. LAKE - MORNING

John pulls himself across the lake.


EXT. WELL - MORNING

John reaches inside his backpack for a TIMER. He winds the

DIAL. Places it on the well. It starts counting down:

TIMER #1: 59 minutes

John inputs the corresponding time into his WRISTWATCH. He’s using the timers as LURES.


EXT. HILLTOP - DAY

John travels into the deep horizon. The scenery is truly breath-taking.

He checks his watch: 42 minutes


EXT. WIND FARM - DAY

John comes upon a shortgrass prairie. He sees a dozen WIND TURBINES in the distance. They each have three PROPELLER BLADES and make up what is called a WIND FARM.

John checks his watch: 30 minutes

We sense he’s nervous about the time. John unpacks the second TIMER and winds the dial.

TIMER #2: 29 minutes

SUDDENLY, THE TURBINE PROPELLERS START TO MOVE --

A heavy WIND rips across the field, carrying a flurry of DEAD LEAVES into John’s path.

INT. TURBINE, BASE - DAY

John climbs into the turbine. Leaves the door WIDE OPEN.

The first thing we notice are the DEAD BODIES. Probably WIND TECHNICIANS slaughtered by the monster long ago. They are decomposing. The smell of rotten flesh is unbearable.

They have one important thing in common - their necks are broken and all of their VOCAL CORDS have been ripped out.

Above is a mostly HOLLOW TUNNEL, with a single LADDER that runs all the way to the top of the tubular steel tower.

The tower itself is bisected by 3 platforms along the way, each with a GATE that can be opened or closed.

John is nervous. Keeps checking his watch. The journey took longer than planned.

He sets the final TIMER and starts to climb the ladder. TIMER #3: 22 minutes

By the way, it takes approximately 30 minutes to climb the Statue of Liberty, so if John wants to get to the top of this turbine before the timers go off, he needs to HAUL ASS.


INT. SHED - DAY

COME IN ON WILL’S STRICKEN EYES. Reeling. Shock doesn’t even

begin to explain what he’s seeing...

His hands hold a SEGMENT OF BRAIDED ROPE that John somehow left behind.

Mia sees it too. Can’t believe it. Wonders for a moment what they can do. Decides: there’s nothing they can do.

Will runs the ROPE to the shed door, prepared to bring it to John. Mia BLOCKS him. Too dangerous.

Will backs away. His heart pounds. No time to think.


EXT. SHED, ROOF - DAY

Will opens the hatch on the roof and climbs out.

Mia watches in horror.
 
55.


INT. TURBINE, PLATFORM ONE - DAY

John is halfway up the turbine. It is COMPLETELY DARK up here except for the light coming through the doorway below.

John shuts and locks the LADDER GATE on platform one. It closes with a faint CLINK noise; a threatening reminder to stay QUIET.

Keeps climbing. He’s moving fast, but each footstep ECHOES loudly in the chamber, tempering his escalation.

A NOTE about Wind Turbines: people who ascend the central ladder, in any other context, would only do so if they were properly HARNESSED TO A SAFETY CABLE, because to fall while climbing a turbine ladder, at this height, would be DEATH.

Which is why it’s so terrifying when...

JOHN SLIPS!!!!!!!!!!!!


EXT. VALLEY - DAY

Will runs with the ROPE SEGMENT. It’s dangerous to move this quickly and recklessly.


EXT. LAKE - DAY

Will jumps into the ROW-BOAT. Unlike last time, he is not afraid anymore.

Will pulls himself across the lake.

He can almost see the TIMER ticking away on the WELL. How much time is left? 20 minutes? Or does it say 15?
Will gets closer. The dial on the timer coming into crisp

FOCUS:

Oh no...

TIMER #1: 1 minute

He has to stop that timer!


INT. TURBINE - DAY

John hangs on for dear life. One hand on the ladder, the other holding his BACKPACK. Dangling in inky darkness.
 
56.


He regains his footing. Takes a step.

THE RUNG BUCKLES

JOHN FALLS TO PLATFORM ONE

LANDS ON HIS ARM. THE BONE BREAKS WITH A DRY SNAP. JOHN WRITHES IN PAIN, UNABLE TO MOVE.


EXT. LAKE - DAY

Will pulls himself across the lake as fast as he can.

TIMER #1: 5 seconds

His hands are bleeding.

4 seconds

Face red.

3	seconds

Tears in his eyes.

2	seconds

Will braces himself. DING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ALL THE QUIET THAT HAS BEEN BUILDING UP SUDDENLY EXPLODES IN ONE DEAFENING SHRIEK AS THE CREATURE LEAPS OUT OF THE LAKE, CAPSIZING THE BOAT, PLUNGING WILL INTO RED ALGAE.


EXT. HILLTOP - DAY

The quiet prairie.

TIMER #2: DING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


INT. TURBINE, PLATFORM TWO - DAY

John climbs one handed. His BROKEN ARM completely useless.

He arrives at PLATFORM TWO. Locks the gate. Below we hear...

TIMER #3: DING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

John is rattled. Everything is going wrong. He looks down.

The ALIEN’S bark reverberates through the tubular tower.

Sounds of movement against the walls rush toward us.

THE ROOF DOOR CREAKS AS PRESSURE IS PLACED AGAINST IT.

There’s a series of clanks and shuffling sounds. BREATHING.

Then POUNDING and CLAWING.

THE ROOF DOOR BENDS OUTWARD IN THE SHAPE OF AN INHUMAN HAND.

JOHN REPELS OFF THE SIDE OF THE TURBINE.

ALL THE WAY DOWN.

FALLING.

FALLING.

FALLING TOO FAST.

FALLING WAY TOO FAST.

JOHN SLOWS HIMSELF DOWN.

THE ROPE BURNING THROUGH HIS HANDS AND SLEEVES BEFORE HE COMES TO A FULL STOP. HOLDING. DANGLING.

There’s about a fifty foot gap between the end of the rope and the ground.

John spots a LADDER on the other side of the base. If he can just swing over to it, he can get down...

WE HEAR THE ALIEN DESCENDING THE TOWER FROM INSIDE.

John holds the rope with his good arm, and runs alongside the outer wall of the turbine.

A few tries and he’s there. Grabs the ladder with his broken arm and climbs down in excruciating pain.

John lands at the base of the turbine.

HE THROWS THE FRONT DOOR CLOSED AND LOCKS IT FROM OUTSIDE.

THE ALIEN IS TRAPPED INSIDE THE TURBINE.

This is his chance. THIS IS WHAT JOHN CAME HERE TO DO:

JOHN
(at the top of his lungs)

APRIL!! APRIL!! CAN YOU HEAR ME?!
 
LOUDER.
59.


No response. John yells

JOHN

APRIL!! WHERE ARE YOU?! APRIL!!

THE LETHAL ARMS OF THE ALIEN SMASH THE TURBINE WALLS FROM INSIDE. THE STEEL BUBBLES AND BENDS AROUND THE BASE. DOING EVERYTHING IT CAN TO BREAK OUT OF THE TURBINE.

John yells EVEN	LOUDER.

JOHN

APRIL!! APRI--

APRIL (O.S.)
(faraway)

--DAD!? DADDY!?

JOHN RUNS TOWARD THE VOICE.

JOHN

I’m coming.


EXT. WIND FARM - DAY

John makes a sudden right turn through the field of dead leaves.


EXT. MARSH - DAY

Another sudden turn, this time left, into MARSHLAND. John’s feet trounce loudly through puddles. Mud splashes everywhere.

EXT. CREEK - DAY

John lands at the edge of a CREEK and sees --

APRIL STANDING ON THE OTHER SIDE. WAITING FOR HER DAD.


EXT. TURBINE - DAY

THE ALIEN WRENCHES ITSELF FREE FROM THE TURBINE.

...and then it WAITS and LISTENS.
 
60.


EXT. CREEK - DAY

The creek is too wide to cross over. John and April race along the bank on opposite sides.
 

The creek starts to narrow bringing them CLOSER
 




CLOSER

 
CLOSER
 

CLOSER

 

CLOSER	CLOSER

CLOSER

John jumps over the narrow part of the creek and catches his daughter. The momentum carries him and April into a mountain of crops.


EXT. CORN FIELD - DAY

Leaves and stalks slap them from all directions as they run.

John slows down, gains control of his breathing. Hears the WHEEZY PURR of the alien nearby. Not sure what direction. Could be anywhere.

April loses her dad for a moment through the dense corn. She gets tangled and falls. Starts to panic.

April turns as a SHADOW PASSES OVER HER.

A HAND GRABS APRIL’S HAND.

Will pulls April to her feet. They run together. Will never lets go of her hand.

John stumbles into a harvest tract. He can see the top of the farmhouse materializing through the crops.

April and Will appear twenty feet away in the same tract.

They’re searching for John.

John tries to motion them over but -- THUD.

A SCARECROW DROPS OUT OF THE SKY AND LANDS BETWEEN THEM - AS IF THROWN BY THE ALIEN. EVERYONE DUCKS. FRIGHTENED AND SILENT. MUSIC SCORE RISES.

THERE IS MOVEMENT ALL AROUND THEM.

BUT WHERE IS IT COMING FROM?
 
61.


IT’S COMING...

FROM BEHIND...

MIA (V.O.)

April?

A LINE FORMS IN THE CROPS. THE KIND OF LINE MADE BY SOMETHING TRAMPLING THROUGH A FIELD. HEADING DIRECTLY TOWARDS APRIL.

APRIL STARES AT THE THROWN SCARECROW. IT’S THE ONE SHE LEFT BEHIND EARLIER.

HER EYES BIG AND FULL. CONCENTRATING.

MIA (V.O.)

Can you hear me?


FLASHBACK: INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE - DAY

Mia watches as a DOCTOR adjusts April’s new HEARING AIDS at an AUDIOLOGIST OFFICE. John stands quietly in the background.

APRIL

i can hear you

The Doctor inspects April’s ears with an OTOSCOPE.

MIA

How’s it feel?

APRIL

stings

DOCTOR

Your ears are going to be extremely sensitive for a while.

MIA
(quietly to John)

You should say something.

John opens his mouth as if to talk, but he can’t find the words.


FLASHBACK: EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY
 

They leave the doctor’s office.

John tries to place a comforting hand on April’s shoulder.

She pushes his hand away.
 
62.


FLASHBACK: INT. FARMHOUSE, UPSTAIRS - DAY

April stands sadly in the hall, studying playful letters on a bedroom door which spell out “Iris”.

A noise grabs her attention --


FLASHBACK: INT. FARMHOUSE, LIVING ROOM - SUNSET

April moves through the house, testing the volume on her hearing aids.

She is taken with all the SOUNDS around her. THE HUM OF THE AIR CONDITIONING. THE REFRIGERATOR BUZZ. THE CROWS OUTSIDE...

APRIL RECOILS. A STRANGE HIGH-PITCH RINGING PULSATES IN HER EAR, LIKE AN IRRITATING, PAINFUL WHISTLE.


FLASHBACK: EXT. CORN FIELD - SUNSET April follows the RINGING outside.
Hundreds of CROWS flock away from the corn field.

April sees her father placing a SIGNAL GENERATOR on one of the SCARECROWS.

The high pitched sound is coming from the generator. It holds uncomfortably resonant in April’s ear.

April approaches the SCARECROW and turns OFF the SIGNAL GENERATOR.

JOHN

What are you doing?

APRIL

hurts my ears

John turns the generator back ON. Walks away.

April turns it OFF again, defiant.

JOHN

April, what are you doing?

APRIL

hurts my ears

JOHN
No it doesn’t. Only animals can

hear this. Go back inside.
 
63.


John turns it back ON. Walks away again.

APRIL

I hate you.

John stops.

APRIL

I wish you died instead of her.

BACK TO:

STALKS BREAK AND BEND BEHIND THE CHILDREN.

THE ALIEN KNOWS THEY’RE CLOSE.

April crawls to the THROWN SCARECROW.

Will looks at his sister like she’s crazy.

April reaches into the body of the scarecrow and retrieves:

THE SIGNAL GENERATOR

April and John lock eyes.

John sees where she’s going with this...

April is going to use the signal generator against the alien.

John nods, encouraging her.

April sets the FREQUENCY DIAL on the signal generator to 500 GHz - its max setting.

The alien steps out of the corn.

April cranks the OUTPUT to 100%.

John gives April a thumbs up.

They are finally working together. They are finally starting to communicate.

April’s finger hovers over the ON/OFF switch.

She can feel the alien’s breath on the back of her neck. WITH THE FLICK OF A SWITCH, APRIL TURNS THE GENERATOR ON! But nothing happens...

John and April look on in horror.
 
64.


She hits the switch again. Nothing.

April flips the generator over and pulls out the BATTERIES.

They are CORRODED. John can’t believe it. It’s all over.

MIA (V.O.)

What are you thinking about?

JOHN (V.O.)

Nothing.

The alien hears April’s breathing change. Her hands start to tremble.

MIA (V.O.)

Why won’t you talk to us anymore?

JOHN (V.O.)

I don’t know.

April goes white. She stares helplessly at her father.

MIA (V.O.)
You just disappear sometimes...
(beat)

Into a quiet place.

PUSH IN ON JOHN’S FACE, AS WE REALIZE, THE FLASHBACKS ARE HIS MEMORIES. THEY CONTINUE TO BUILD INTO AN OVERLAPPING CACOPHONY OF VOICES AND IMAGES. BARELY COHERENT. AGGRESSIVELY SENTIMENTAL. FOCUSING ON THE THINGS WE STRUGGLE WITH ON THE INSIDE. ALL THE THINGS THAT GO LEFT UNSAID. A MONTAGE OF THE SUBCONSCIOUS. THE UNSPOKEN. THE QUIET PLACE OF OUR MINDS:

APRIL (V.O.)

How come you and Daddy don’t talk?

IRIS (V.O.)
I think I like it better when you

don’t say anything to me.

MIA (V.O.)

You act like she doesn’t exist.

APRIL (V.O.)

I hate you.

JOHN (V.O.)

She knows I love her.

MIA (V.O.)

She needs to hear you say it.
 
65.

JOHN (V.O.)

I need to tell you something.

IRIS (V.O.)

What is it?

Tears form in the corners of John’s eyes. He knows what he has to do. John silently backs away. Opens his mouth. And says with everything in his lungs:

JOHN

I love you.

And with that, the alien turns its focus from the kids to John. This is John’s final sacrifice for his family.

April and Will look up through tears. They see the alien rip across the tract toward their father.

Just before the alien LUNGES, Will turns the volume all the way down on April’s hearing aid, drowning out John’s CRIES as OUR WORLD GOES SILENT.


EXT. CORN FIELD, CLEARING - DAY

SLOW MOTION: April and Will escape into the corn.


EXT. CORN FIELD, WEATHER VANE - DAY

SLOW MOTION: April and Will pass the WEATHER VANE. They follow it to the FARMHOUSE

EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY

SLOW MOTION: April and Will run to the shed. The alien close behind. BLOOD on its face.


INT. SHED - DAY

SLOW MOTION: April runs to the back of the shed.

She removes two BATTERIES from the MP3 PLAYER and slaps them into the SIGNAL GENERATOR.

April stands outside in front of the shed.

The alien somehow inches away.

April lets out a stunned cry.
 
66.


Falls back.

Closes her eyes.

Activates the SIGNAL GENERATOR.

WE HEAR NOTHING OVER THE HIGH PITCHED RING OF THE GENERATOR, which seems to take on a music-like quality; heavy dissonance climbing to an unexpected harmonic crescendo.

April looks up, terrified at what she’ll see.

SHE SEES --

THE ALIEN FROZEN IN A SEIZURE.

SHIVERING, ALMOST. FROM THE INSIDE.

A TINY VIBRATION MOVING THROUGH ITS COMPLEXION.

LIKE A SONIC TUMOR, GROWING, EXPANDING, EATING AWAY ALL THE VITAL PARTS THAT MAKE IT HEAR, THINK, MOVE, KILL...

THE ALIEN COWERS		
CONTORTS	JUST AS --	
COLLAPSES DEAD		

SOUND BEGINS TO FADE BACK IN ALL AROUND US.

AND TIME SEEMS TO SPEED UP TO NORMAL.

April turns to close the SHED DOORS...

But Mia stops her. She pushes the doors WIDE OPEN.

They don’t have to be afraid anymore.

The family embraces. Melting into a flurry of emotions that have gone unexpressed for far too long.

SLOW FADE TO:


EXT. CEMETERY - SUNSET

Autumn leaves blow over a recently harvested field. They swirl through the crisp air and fall on a pair of HEADSTONES.

April stands in a SUNDAY DRESS. Her hair braided behind her head. The SIGNAL GENERATOR hangs around her neck.

She places a PURPLE IRIS on a grave marked JOHN WALKER.
 
67.


Mia and Will stand behind her with a STROLLER. A ONE YEAR OLD plays nearby.

Mia looks at April, she smiles, brushes her daughter’s hair behind one ear.

WE HEAR THE LAUGHTER OF BABY IRIS FILL THE AIR.

THE END.
