BLACK SCREEN:

EXT. UNDERWATER

Our black screen slowly fades to a murky blue-grey as it becomes apparent that we are underwater. From the top of our screen drifts the nude body of a man, arms outstretched, sinking slowly. He moves his legs in a slight struggle as he is pulled deeper and deeper into the water. His hand lashes out in a final sudden movement as his body becomes still.

We are now close in on the manʼs face to reveal GEORGE, 52, as he begins to toss and turn violently in the water searching for air.

A title appears over our image in simple bold type:

FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 30, 1962.

CUT TO:

EXT. SNOW COVERED ROAD. DUSK

George is walking in the snow. He is on a quiet stretch of road and the snow is falling gently. All is silent. Ahead of George and in our line of sight is a crushed car that has flipped over on itʼs top. There is broken glass everywhere and the skid marks of the car are visible on the icy road. The taillights are still on and there is steam coming from the hood. A body is hanging out of a smashed window on the driverʼs side of the car.

CUT TO:

EXT. UNDERWATER.

George continues to toss and turn underwater even more violently as he struggles to find air.

CUT TO:

EXT. SNOWY ROAD. DUSK

Arriving at the wreck, George looks at the bloody face of the dead driver - it is a handsome man in his mid thirties, JIM. There is a lifeless and bloody black and white dog on the dashboard against the broken windshield.
 
2.

George slowly lies down in the snow next to Jim. He stares at Jimʼs bloody face and then leans over and kisses Jim on the mouth. George pulls back.

Jimʼs open eyes and blood covered face fill our screen as we push in tighter. His eyes have a cold gelatinous feel about them. We continue to push in until his eyes fill our screen.

There is a faint, repetitive banging sound, like a drum beat, in the background that becomes increasingly louder.

CUT TO:

INT. GEORGEʼS HOUSE - BEDROOM. MORNING 1962

George bolts up in a panic. He canʼt breathe. He is sweating.

The drumbeat sound is loud and constant. In the distance we hear a female voice.

MRS. STRUNK (O.S.) Jennifer stop it! Stop that banging now!

The banging sound stops.

We hear the white noise hum of waves crashing in the distance and the faint sound of seagulls.

Georgeʼs face fills our screen as he recovers from the dream.

GEORGE V.O.

Waking up begins with saying am and now.

We gradually pull back from above to reveal a full length George. He does not look his age - a slim, tan, Englishman who has clearly taken care of himself. He has a full head of salt and pepper hair. He is handsome.

QUICK CUTS OF A COMPLETELY STILL GEORGE FROM ALL SIDES AND ANGLES.

He is nude, lying on a bed, partially covered in wrinkled

white cotton sheets. There is a large black stain and an ink pen on the sheets next to him.

FROM THE CEILING WE PUSH IN SLOWLY UNTIL WE ARE JUST OVER GEORGE. WE SETTLE IN ON HIS FACE. WE ARE INTIMATE WITH HIM AND CAN HEAR HIM BREATHING SOFTLY.

A twitch of his left hand. A worn gold signet ring on the little finger.

George reaches over to the other side of the bed as if searching for someone. There is an open fountain pen on this side of the bed with a small stack of stationery. The ink pen has left an enormous black stain on the sheets. Some of the ink comes off on his fingers.

He gains his bearings and catches his breath. He lifts his fingers to his lips. The ink leaves a slight mark on his mouth. He lies still for a moment.

FLASHBACK OF GEORGE KISSING JIM IN THE SNOW

CUT TO:

INT: GEORGEʼS HOUSE - BEDROOM. MORNING 1962 -- CONTINUOUS

GEORGE V.O.

For the past eight months waking up has actually hurt. The cold realization that I am still here slowly sets in.

George, with bed hair, still sweating, untangles himself from the sheets and sits up. He holds onto his head as if in pain.

A pile of clothes is in the chair next to the bed. Books and magazines are loosely stacked next to the end table. There is an empty scotch bottle on the floor. The room is dark and in disarray.

On the floor on Georgeʼs side of the bed are about 10 carefully addressed envelopes and letters laid out in a grid.
 
4.

George looks at the alarm clock. It has stopped at 4:57. He looks at his wrist watch on the bedside table. 7:22.

George sighs and bangs the alarm clock a few times on the table top, winds it and resets it. The second hand is now ticking loudly.

GEORGE V.O. (CONTʼD)

I was never terribly fond of waking up.

He rises, navigates the grid of letters, and walks to the bathroom.

INT. GEORGEʼS HOUSE - BATHROOM. MORNING -- CONTINUOUS

A SERIES OF SHOTS:

Relieving himself at the toilet.

Standing in the shower letting the hot water wash over him.

GEORGE V.O.

I was never one to jump out of bed and greet the day with a smile like Jim was.

Shaving.

GEORGE V.O. (CONTʼD) I used to want to punch him sometimes in the morning he was so happy.

Taking a handful of aspirin

GEORGE V.O. (CONTʼD)

I always used to tell him that only fools greet the day with a smile, that only fools could possibly escape the simple truth that now isnʼt simply now: itʼs a cold reminder. One day later than yesterday, one year later than last year and that sooner or later it will come.
 
5.

Scrubbing his fingernails briskly with a brush.

GEORGE V.O. (CONTʼD) He used to laugh at me and then give me a kiss on the cheek.

INT. GEORGEʼS HOUSE - BEDROOM. MORNING -- MINUTES LATER

Opening an extremely organized drawer and taking out a pair of perfectly folded black socks.

GEORGE V.O.

It takes time in the morning for me to become George, time to adjust to what is expected of George and how he is to behave.

Opening another equally organized drawer and pulling out an immaculately pressed and folded white shirt.

GEORGE V.O. (CONTʼD)

By the time I have dressed and put the final layer of polish on the now slightly stiff but quite perfect George I know fully what part Iʼm supposed to play.

George runs a brush over his shoes.

He dabs the back of his neck with cologne.

END SERIES OF SHOTS.

Standing at his dresser, George adjusts his tie and looks at himself intently in the mirror as our camera glides up Georgeʼs body to his face to reveal the now fully realized public face of George.

GEORGE V.O. (CONTʼD) Looking in the mirror staring back at me isnʼt so much a face as the expression of a predicament.

GEORGE

(whispering aloud to himself)

Just get through the goddamn day.
 
6.

GEORGE V.O.

A bit melodramatic I guess.

INT. GEORGE’S HOUSE - HALLWAY. MORNING -- CONTINUOUS

George walks down the hallway. As he approaches the living room he glances out the window and sees JIM.

GEORGE V.O.

But then again my heart has been broken.

JIM, 34, handsome and well built in a classical American way is waxing a surfboard on a pair of saw horses. Two more surfboards lie on the bright green lawn behind him. A black and white, smooth fox terrier, like the dead dog in the car, lies in the sun on his side next to Jim. Another smaller, but identical dog is biting at the collar of the first dog. Jim is disciplining the smaller dog.

GEORGE V.O. (CONT’D)

I feel as If I am sinking,

drowning, can’t breathe.

George stares back at Jim but his expression is suddenly changed by a sharp pain that grips his chest.

He holds onto the louvered rail that separates the hall from the living room to avoid falling over. He stands still and takes a deep breath.

When the pain passes, he looks back out of the window. No surfboards. No Jim. No dogs. Just a brown over-grown lawn.

George closes his eyes, and takes a deep breath.

He makes his way down the hallway and into the kitchen.

INT. GEORGE’S HOUSE - KITCHEN. MORNING -- CONTINUOUS

George plugs in the toaster and opens the bread box. No bread. He opens the refrigerator. No bread. He opens the freezer to find a loaf of white bread frozen solid. He drops the bread on the counter with a thud. Irritated he bangs the bread several times on the kitchen counter. He abandons the loaf of bread and begins making himself a pot of coffee.
 
7.

INT. GEORGEʼS HOUSE - DINING AREA. MORNING -- MINUTES LATER

George is seated at the table having his morning coffee as the phone rings. George looks at his watch. 7:40. He looks back at the ringing phone and decides not to answer it.

FLASHBACK - INT. GEORGEʼS HOUSE - LIVING ROOM. DAY (1948)

George and Jim are standing in the completely new and absolutely empty house for the first time. It is stunning. The starkness of it then is a total contrast to the house of today. This is the house before it had a life.

GEORGE

Arenʼt you going to say something?

JIM

Are you kidding? Itʼs spectacular.

George is quietly staring at Jim with a faint smile on his face. Jim smiles when he realizes this, then slips up close to George and moves toward him for a kiss.

GEORGE

What are you doing?

George pushes him away. Nervously looking out of the large plate glass window.

GEORGE (CONTʼD)

Jim, stop it. I donʼt think youʼre quite ready for life in a glass house.

JIM

Drapes, old man.

Jim moves in for a kiss only to be held back by George.

JIM (CONTʼD)

Youʼre the one whoʼs always saying that weʼre invisible.

GEORGE

Thatʼs not exactly what I meant.
 
8.

George gives in and the two men begin to kiss.

END FLASHBACK

WE PULL BACK to reveal George alone in the house, across the dining area and living room and out the pivoting glass doors and across the dead lawn. Georgeʼs house is modest in size, yet has dynamic lines. It is an example of very bold architecture, circa 1948, that has become somewhat ramshackle over time. We take in the full view of George in his world as the phone continues to ring.

SERIES OF SHOTS:

Georgeʼs empty bedroom as the phone continues to ring.

Surfboards leaning against a wall in the garage.

Books and architectural models on the living room shelves next to a drafting table.

END SERIES OF SHOTS.

We cut back to George staring into space for several beats as the phone continues to ring.

GEORGE V.O.

For the first time in my life I

canʼt see my future. Every day goes by in a haze, but today I have decided will be different.

INT. GEORGEʼS HOUSE - BEDROOM. MORNING -- MINUTES LATER

As George stands in front of his book case, the phone starts to ring again. George looks across the room at the phone which sits on a small table next to an upholstered club chair.

GEORGE V.O.

Finally. You know it has been

raining here all day and Iʼve been

trapped in this house waiting for

you to call.

CUT TO:
 
9.

FLASHBACK - INT. GEORGEʼS HOUSE - BEDROOM. EVENING (1961)

George is sitting in the upholstered club chair reading. He is wearing glasses. He does not recognize the voice on the other end of the phone.

HAROLD (O.S.)

Iʼm sorry. I must have the wrong number. Iʼm calling for Mr. George Falconer...

There is a short uncomfortable silence.

GEORGE

Iʼm sorry, I was expecting someone else. Yes sir, you have indeed called the correct number. How may I help you?

HAROLD (O.S.)

This is Harold Ackerley. Iʼm Jimʼs cousin.

GEORGE

Oh yes, of course. Good evening,

Mr. Ackerley.

HAROLD (O.S.)

Iʼm afraid Iʼm calling with some bad news.

GEORGE

Oh?

HAROLD (O.S.)

Thereʼs been a car accident.

GEORGE

Accident?

HAROLD (O.S.)

There has been a lot of snow here lately and the roads have been icy. On his way into town, Jim lost control of his car.
 
10.

HAROLD (O.S.) (CONT’D)

It was instantaneous apparently.

GEORGE

Oh.

HAROLD (O.S.)

It happened late yesterday, but his

parents didn’t want to call you.

GEORGE

I see.

HAROLD (O.S.)

In fact, they don’t know I’m calling you now, but I thought that you should know.

GEORGE

Thank you.

HAROLD (O.S.)

I know this must be quite a shock.

It was for all of us.

George continues in his robotic state.

GEORGE

Yes, indeed.

GEORGE (CONT’D)

Will there be a service?

HAROLD (O.S.)

The day after tomorrow.

GEORGE

Well I suppose I should get off the phone and book a plane flight.

HAROLD (O.S.)

The service is just for family.

GEORGE

For family. Of course. Well thank you for calling. (Beat) Oh, Mr. Ackerly?
 
11.

HAROLD (O.S.)

Yes.

GEORGE

May I ask what happened to the dogs?

HAROLD (O.S.)

Dogs? There was a dog with him but he died. Was there another one?

GEORGE

Yes. A small female.

HAROLD (O.S.)

Well, I donʼt know to tell you the truth. I havenʼt heard anyone mention another dog.

GEORGE

Well, thank you for calling, Mr.

Ackerly.

HAROLD (O.S.)

Goodbye Mr. Falconer.

George replaces the receiver. As he does, it misses the cradle and falls to the floor, the dial tone continues to hum.

He sits looking blankly ahead in total disbelief. He doesnʼt know what to do. He slides down in the chair and begins to cry silently as the reality of what has happened sets in. He suddenly jumps up, runs out of the room, down the hall, and to the front door.

FLASHBACK - EXT. GEORGEʼS HOUSE - CAMPHOR TREE LANE. EVENING (1961) -- CONTINUOUS

George throws the front door open and dashes out of his house, into the rain, down his driveway and up the road.

FLASHBACK - EXT. STAIRS TO SOLEDAD WAY. EVENING (1961) CONTINUOUS
 
12.

George turns onto a pathway with a steep flight of wooden stairs.

The rain is torrential. George slips on the wet wooden steps as he climbs to the top of the stair case and runs out onto Soledad Way.

FLASHBACK - EXT. CHARLEYʼS DRIVEWAY. EVENING (1961) CONTINUOUS

George runs up the driveway towards Charleyʼs house. As he reaches the front door he rings the doorbell several times and begins pounding on the door.

A startled blonde woman opens the door. CHARLOTTE aka CHARLEY, 47, is a British friend of Georgeʼs.

George throws himself at her as she embraces him and he sobs uncontrollably.

END FLASHBACK

INT. GEORGEʼS HOUSE - BEDROOM. MORNING -- 1962.

The phone rings once more and then stops. George looks back to the bookcase.

He grabs a Huxley novel and retreats to the bathroom.

INT. GEORGEʼS HOUSE - BATHROOM. MORNING -- CONTINUOUS

Sitting on the toilet, George reads.

There is a constant banging from outside. This is the same banging we heard earlier. George attempts to ignore the irritating sound but finds it impossible to concentrate and slams his book shut. He looks across the street. The window is positioned so that when on the toilet George can see out, but only his head can be seen from outside.

EXT. THE STRUNK HOUSE. MORNING -- CONTINUOUS

WE SEE THE STRUNK FAMILY BUT DO NOT HEAR WHAT THEY ARE SAYING.

The Strunk house is a pristine, absolutely new ranch house
 
13.

with a manicured lawn that reeks of the traditional American dream circa 1962.

JENNIFER STRUNK, 8, a blonde, very American little girl, hammer in hand, pulverizes an old bathroom scale that sheʼs pulled out of one of the shiny new trash cans. She tightly clutches a white Persian kitten with a pink ribbon. Jennifer is wearing a gingham dress and she chants an annoying advertising jingle over and over in monotone as she pounds away at the scale with the hammer.

MRS. STRUNK, 32, appears in the doorway. She is the archetype of the young attractive suburban wife and mother.

She is usually calm and poised but today she is clearly exasperated and yells from the front door at her daughter to put the scale back in the trash can.

Jennifer ignores her mother and continues pounding away with increasing violence.

Meanwhile, Jenniferʼs oldest brother TOM, 9, is combing over their lawn with a metal detector, as a younger brother CHRISTOPHER, 5, digs ferociously at the lawn with a small garden shovel. The metal detector suddenly shrieks, having located something.

Jennifer drops her cat, runs to her brothers and joins in the digging.

The lawn is littered with newly excavated holes and the

flower beds also seem to be in a freshly unearthed state as if a dog has been digging in them. Simply put, the normally perfect front yard is an absolute disaster area.

The three children start screaming loudly to their mother.

Mrs. Strunk rushes over to the hole to see. As the metal detector shrieks again, the children scream and even Mrs. Strunk squeals with delight and gets down on her knees to dig.

CLOSE UP SHOTS FROM DIFFERENT ANGLES OF THE CHILDREN DIGGING FEROCIOUSLY FOR THE MONEY.
 
14.

WE CUT BACK TO GEORGE, AS HE WATCHES THE STRUNK FAMILY.

MR. STRUNK, 35, a well dressed young executive with briefcase in hand, comes out of the house shouting at his family.

His wife rushes over to him but cannot pacify him as Mr.

Strunk surveys the destroyed lawn and flower beds.

SHOT FROM A LOW VANTAGE POINT WITH CHRISTOPHER IN THE FOREGROUND CATCHING A BUTTERFLY ON A FLOWER.

The Strunks continue to argue as Mr. Strunk brushes off his wifeʼs attempts at affection.

BACK ON THE LOW SHOT OF CHRISTOPHER NOW HOLDING THE REMNANTS OF THE BUTTERFLY IN HIS HAND.

Mrs. Strunk leans forward and kisses her husband on the cheek as he walks towards his car.

Mrs. Strunk heads over to the battered scale and throws it in the trash can.

As she does, she looks across the street at Georgeʼs window to catch him staring back at her. She begins to wave.

INT. GEORGEʼS HOUSE - BATHROOM. MORNING -- CONTINUOUS

Embarrassed, George ducks forward to hide from view. As he does, the phone starts ringing again.

He sits still for a moment. He sighs. Finally realizing that the phone will not stop ringing, he gets up. His pants are still around his ankles as he shuffles out into the bedroom to answer the phone.

INT. GEORGEʼS HOUSE - BEDROOM. MORNING -- CONTINUOUS

GEORGE

Hello Charley.

BRITISH WOMAN (O.S.)

How did you know it was me?

INT. CHARLEYʼS HOUSE - BEDROOM. MORNING -- CONTINUOUS
 
15.

We cut to a shot of CHARLEY 48 in her bed smoking a cigarette. Her bedside table is cluttered with pill bottles and what is left of a cocktail. Her ashtray is filled with cigarette butts and magazines are strewn around her in the bed. Strawberry blonde and fair, Charley was clearly once a great beauty but is now a lonely and manic alcoholic. Charley is at the age where beauty hangs by a thread. On a good day she can still manage a striking appearance yet good days are few and far between. Today is not a good day.

GEORGE (O.S.)

Charlotte, no one else ever calls

me before 8:00 in the morning.

CHARLEY

I didnʼt call too early, did I? You sound grumpy.

GEORGE (O.S.)

No. I just have a headache. I was going to call you actually. Is it too late to change my mind about tonight?

CHARLEY

Of course not! I havenʼt seen you all week. Iʼm dying for a dose of you.

GEORGE (O.S.)

I	know. Iʼm sorry. So, great. Iʼll see you tonight. I need to run though. Iʼm late for work. Iʼll call you later from school.

CHARLEY

Iʼll see you tonight.

GEORGE (O.S.)

Good-bye kiddo.

CHARLEY

Bye, old man.

We linger on Charley as she hangs up the phone. We see the joy in her face. She has a reason to live. She takes a long
 
16.

deep drag of her cigarette, then stubs it out and throws herself back against her bed pillows.

INT. GEORGEʼS HOUSE - BEDROOM. MORNING -- MINUTES LATER.

George, now fully dressed with his jacket and eyeglasses on, goes to his desk and unlocks a drawer. He carefully lifts out an object and places it on his desk. We see clearly that the object is a gun. He picks it up, flicks open the revolver and turns it up in the air to empty the bullets. There are no bullets. George sighs, clicks the gun closed, and places it in his briefcase. He then shoves a stack of papers into the briefcase along with the Huxley book and heads out the door to the hall.

INT. GEORGEʼS HOUSE - LIVING ROOM. MORNING -- CONTINUOUS

George is coming down the hall. As he rushes toward the front door, he practically knocks over his cleaning woman ALVA, arriving with a bag of groceries and the newspaper under her arm. Alva is a kind, Hispanic woman in her mid 40ʼs.

ALVA

Good morning Mr. George.

Alva places the bag of groceries on the dining table.

ALVA (CONTʼD)

Sir, you donʼt look so good. Did you not sleep again?

GEORGE

Good morning Alva. No, I didnʼt sleep well. You forgot to take the bread out of the freezer.

ALVA

It stays fresh that way.

GEORGE

It was a little too fresh this morning. There are some papers laid out on my desk that need to stay
(MORE)
 
17.

GEORGE (CONTʼD)

there so please donʼt move them.

And my pen leaked all over the bed.

Iʼm sorry about the sheets.

ALVA

Itʼs OK sir.

GEORGE

Alva?

ALVA

Yes sir?

GEORGE

Thank you. Youʼre wonderful.

Georges crosses to the table and kisses Alva on the cheek. She is stunned. George turns and leaves the house as Alva stares after him as though he is from Mars.

EXT. GEORGEʼS HOUSE. MORNING -- MINUTES LATER

George backs his car down his driveway and into the street.

The clock on the dash reads 8:04.

Our camera speed slows as we see Jennifer tap dancing in the driveway. Jennifer looks at George in a slightly provocative manner and tugs on her dress as he drives past.

Christopher aims a toy machine gun directly at Georgeʼs car and fires to squeals of laughter.

George stares Christopher directly in the eye and holds up his hand in a mock gun fashion and mouths “Bang, bang” to the boy, stopping Christopher dead in his tracks.

George waves at Mrs. Strunk still on her lawn watching the children play as Tom walks towards the street with an arm full of school books.

She waves back - a warm smile - as George eases his car past the Strunk house.
 
18.

EXT. SAN TOMAS COLLEGE - PARKING LOT. DAY -- LATER

George pulls into the faculty parking lot of the school. His radio is on as he waits for three female students to pass in front of his car.

RADIO ANNOUNCER (O.S.) Premier Nikita Krushchev said today that the Soviet Unionʼs policy of peaceful coexistence averted a nuclear war over Cuba. Krushchev declared that the missiles in Cuba were ready for launching but not used, sparing the world from a nuclear holocaust...

He pulls into a parking space and turns off the car. George closes his eyes and breathes deeply several times. He looks at himself in the rear view mirror, smooths his hair with his hand and straightens his tie. He grabs his briefcase, and gets out of his car.

George makes his way through a sea of students and faculty, like a salmon swimming upstream.

We cut to George continuing his walk as a lawn filled with students stretches out in front of him.

George notices a young couple lying together on the grass.

KENNY, 20, is a 3rd year student. He has dark brown hair, pale skin and piercing blue eyes. Kenny is not classically handsome , yet is attractive in a somewhat gangly way. LOIS, 20, is a stunning and very stylish blonde girl with a bored, beatnik feel to her manner.

Catching a glimpse of George, Kennyʼs eyes light up. We hang on this for a moment as Kennyʼs hand shoots up in an enthusiastic wave. Turning to see George, Lois offers nothing but a nod and an exhale of cigarette smoke. George waves back tentatively.

Georgeʼs eyes linger on Kenny who is staring at him intently.

Kenny stares after George while Lois reclines and continues
 
19.

to smoke.

Reaching the Arts Building, George heads inside.

INT. SAN TOMAS COLLEGE - OFFICE OF THE ENGLISH DEPARTMENT - DAY -- MOMENTS LATER

George walks past two secretaries. One is quite a beautiful blonde in her early twenties.

BLONDE SECRETARY

Good morning professor.

GEORGE

Good morning.

BLONDE SECRETARY

Oh, professor Falconer?

GEORGE

Yes.

BLONDE SECRETARY There was a student here this morning asking for your address.

GEORGE

My address? What was his name?

BLONDE SECRETARY

He didnʼt say sir, and Iʼm sorry but I didnʼt ask him. He said heʼs in one of your classes this term.

We linger on Georgeʼs face a moment. He is intrigued by this.

GEORGE

Did you give it to him?

BLONDE SECRETARY

(nervous)

Yes sir. I did. I hope thatʼs OK. I realize I probably shouldnʼt have, but he was very nice and before I knew it...
 
20.

George looks the girl up and down.

OUR SCREEN IS FILLED WITH CLOSE UP SHOTS OF THE SECRETARYʼS FACE AND HAIR.

George is taking in her beauty. He looks her dead in the eyes.

GEORGE

Your hair looks great up like that.

BLONDE SECRETARY

What?

GEORGE

I said your hair looks great like that. It suits you. You always look so beautiful. Really fresh. You have such a lovely smile.

George breathes in.

GEORGE (CONTʼD)

Arpege?

BLONDE SECRETARY

Sir?

GEORGE

Really beautiful.

George walks away. The Blonde Secretary looks back at the other girl, clearly dumbfounded at Georgeʼs manner.

INT. SAN TOMAS COLLEGE - FACULTY LOUNGE. DAY MOMENTS LATER

George enters the room and makes an effort to avoid eye contact with anyone. An older professor DON who is reading the paper looks up and smiles at George.

GEORGE

Good morning Don.

DON

Good morning George.
 
21.

The large wall clock reads 9:10. There are two vending machines against one wall of the lounge.

George grabs a cup of coffee from the coffee machine, and gets a Hersheyʼs bar from the candy machine. George puts more change into the machine and gets a second candy bar. As he does, GRANT, a tall young professor, slips next to George and presses the button on the coffee machine.

GRANT

Good morning George.

GEORGE

Good morning Grant.

George grabs his second candy bar and heads out the door as Grant follows.

GRANT

You look awful. What have you been doing?

The two men exit the building and begin walking.

EXT. SAN TOMAS COLLEGE - CAMPUS. DAY -- CONTINUOUS

The sky is a dark brown haze.

George eats his candy bar, gently steering them towards the tennis courts.

GEORGE

Look around Grant... most of these students aspire to nothing more than a corporate job and a desire to raise coke-drinking, TV-watching children who as soon as they can speak start chanting TV jingles and smashing things with hammers.

GRANT

Youʼre really scaring me today

George.
 
22.

GEORGE

I sometimes find them staring at me

in a kind of bovine stupor as if I

were lecturing in a foreign

language. Remind me why we

shouldnʼt all just be annihilated?

George scans the tennis courts out of the corner of his eye. Only one court is occupied, by two young men playing singles.

The sun comes out with a sudden fierce heat that cuts through the yellow smog-haze. The players are shirtless.

CLOSE-UP SHOTS OF THE PLAYERS. OUR SOUND FADES TO ONLY THE AMPLIFIED SOUND OF THE GAME. SOUNDS OF THE BALL HITTING THE RACQUET AND OF THE FEET OF THE PLAYERS SLIDING ON THE RED CLAY COURT AND OF THEIR SIGHS AND QUICK BREATHING AS THEY WHACK THE BALL BACK AND FORTH.

George clocks this intently and takes in every detail.

OUR SOUND RETURNS WITH A WHACK OF THE BALL AND A GUTTURAL OUTCRY FROM ONE OF THE PLAYERS.

The stream of sunlight has passed and the sky is once again dull and flat.

George realizes that Grant is talking and has been talking.

George has a faint smile on his face, still gazing at the players.

GRANT

You seem to think this is all a joke. Weʼre living in a world where nuclear war is a real threat. I donʼt understand how you canʼt be concerned.

GEORGE

Youʼre serious arenʼt you?

GRANT

Yes, Iʼm serious. George, did you (MORE)
 
23.

GRANT (CONTʼD)

even read the article that I gave you on bomb shelters? Ours is almost done. We had 3 different contractors work on it so none of them know what weʼve got, then weʼre having the outside of it landscaped so no one will know itʼs there.

GEORGE

Really?

CUT TO:

A SHOT OF GRANT AND HIS FAMILY IN A SIMPLE CONCRETE BLOCK SHELTER STARING DEAD INTO OUR CAMERA AS IF POSING FOR A PORTRAIT. GRANT IS SMOKING A PIPE, AND THE FAMILY ARE WEARING THEIR SUNDAY BEST. THEY ARE SURROUNDED BY ANIMALS: A COW, A GOAT, CHICKENS ETC.

CUT BACK TO:

GRANT

If word gets out that youʼve got a better shelter, then everyone will try to get in when something happens.

GEORGE

And so?

GRANT

There will be no time for sentiment when the Russians fire a missile at us.

GEORGE

If itʼs going to be a world with no time for sentiment Grant, itʼs not a world that I want to live in.

One of our tennis players lets out a loud THWACK.

INT. SAN TOMAS COLLEGE - GEORGEʼS OFFICE. DAY
 
24.

George is sitting on the edge of his desk. Frozen. He has a look of extreme melancholy on his face. His shoulders are slumped.

He waits for the clock to strike 10:00 exactly and then he stands, picks up his briefcase and heads out the door.

INT. SAN TOMAS COLLEGE - GEORGEʼS CLASS -- MINUTES LATER

George walks into class and places his briefcase on the desk. Most of the students continue to talk.

George sits on the edge of the desk and reaches into his briefcase. He fumbles around for a moment, pauses, and then pulls out a book. He sits quietly with a slight look of disgust on his face staring directly at the talkers as, one by one, they succumb to his silence.

Finally George speaks.

GEORGE

“After Many a Summer Dies the Swan.”

Blank stares.

GEORGE (CONTʼD)

I trust youʼve all read the Huxley novel I assigned almost three weeks ago? How does the title relate to our story?

He looks around the room as a few hands go up.

GEORGE (CONTʼD)

Yes, Mr. Mong.

ALEX MONG

It doesnʼt. Itʼs about this rich guy whoʼs afraid heʼs too old for this girl...

George, irritated by the response of Mr. Mong closes his eyes tightly and takes a deep breath as our sound fades.

CUT TO:
 
25.

FLASHBACK - EXT. UNDERWATER

George is tossing and turning underwater struggling to breathe. He turns over and over trying to find the surface of the water but he continues to sink.

CUT BACK TO:

INT. SAN TOMAS COLLEGE - GEORGEʼS CLASS -- MOMENTS LATER

Our sound returns as George opens his eyes and snaps back to the present. Laughter dies away. The only one not laughing is Kenny, who is watching George intently. George remains frozen for a moment as RUSS raises his hand.

GEORGE

Russ?

George signals for Russ to speak.

Our camera speed slows and our sound fades as George seems mesmerized by the blank eyes of Lois. Lois is smoking and staring straight back at George in an almost aggressive manner. She begins to whisper into Kennyʼs ear. Kenny continues to watch George who has a dazed expression on his face.

George slowly regains his composure and comes to attention as MYRON - a dark-complexioned young man with intense eyes and glasses- raises his hand.

OUR SOUND RETURNS.

GEORGE (CONTʼD)

Yes, Mr. Hirsch.

MYRON

Sir, on page 79, Mr. Propter says that the stupidest text in the Bible is: “they hated me without a cause.” Does he mean the Nazis were right to hate the Jews? Is Huxley an anti-Semite?

GEORGE

No.

The class stares at George, expecting more from such a provocative question.

GEORGE (CONTʼD)

No, Mr. Huxley is not an anti

Semite. The Nazis were obviously

wrong to hate the Jews. But their

hating the Jews was not without a

cause... But the cause wasnʼt real.

The cause was imagined. The cause

was FEAR.

Curious stares.

GEORGE (CONTʼD)

Letʼs leave the Jews out of this for a moment and think of another minority. One that can go unnoticed if it needs to.

George looks directly at WALTER, a slightly effeminate young man, who turns away embarrassed.

GEORGE (CONTʼD)

There are all sorts of minorities, blondes for example, but a minority is only thought of as one when it constitutes some kind of threat to the majority. A real threat or an imagined one. And therein lies the FEAR. And, if the minority is somehow invisible...

Another glance at Walter.

GEORGE (CONTʼD)

...the fear is even greater.

Kenny tries to find the target of Georgeʼs glance, but to no avail.

GEORGE (CONTʼD)

And this FEAR is the reason the minority is persecuted. So, there

GEORGE (CONTʼD)

always is a cause. And the cause is FEAR. Minorities are just people. People...

Again a subtle look at Walter.

GEORGE (CONTʼD)

...like us.

Walter shrinks in his seat.

GEORGE (CONTʼD)

I can see that Iʼve lost you a bit. You know what? Letʼs forget about Huxley today.

George places his book on his desk. Several students look up from their notebooks.

GEORGE (CONTʼD)

Letʼs just talk about fear. Fear, after all, is our real enemy. Fear is taking over our world. Fear is being used as a tool of manipulation in our society.

Itʼs how politicians peddle policy and how Madison Avenue sells us things that we donʼt need. Think about it. Fear that weʼre going to be attacked, fear that there are communists lurking around every corner, fear that some little Caribbean country that doesnʼt believe in our way of life poses a threat to us. Fear that black culture may take over the world. Fear of Elvis Presleyʼs hips.(beat) Well, maybe that one is a real fear. Fear that our bad breath might ruin our friendships... Fear of growing old and being alone.

George notices a few eyes looking over his shoulder at the clock on the wall which reads 12:05.
 
28.

GEORGE (CONTʼD)

Fear that weʼre useless and that no one cares what we have to say.

Some shift about uncomfortably in their seats, yet Kenny stares, amazed.

George surveys the anxious class, realizing he has lost their attention.

GEORGE (CONTʼD)

Have a good weekend.

George closes his book, shoves it in his briefcase, and walks out the door as his students gather their things.

Kenny gets up to follow after George but Lois corners him to talk.

EXT. SAN TOMAS COLLEGE - ARTS BUILDING. DAY -- LATER

George is heading briskly towards the administration building when he hears Kennyʼs voice.
