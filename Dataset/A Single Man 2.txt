KENNY

Sir! May I speak to you for a minute? I have to go down to the bookstore.

George pauses allowing Kenny to catch up to him and then the two men begin walking.

KENNY (CONTʼD)

Why donʼt you talk to us like that all the time?

GEORGE

I donʼt think it went over very well.

KENNY

Man, fear of things gets to me all the time, but you canʼt talk about it with anyone or you just sound like a fool.
 
29.

GEORGE

You canʼt even talk about it with

Lois?

KENNY

I donʼt think sheʼs afraid of

anything.

GEORGE

Everyoneʼs afraid of something

Kenny.

KENNY

What are you afraid of sir?

GEORGE

Cars.

KENNY

How can you live in Los Angeles and be afraid of cars?

GEORGE

Maybe you canʼt.

KENNY

Sometimes my fear of things can almost paralyze me. Itʼs like I get really panic stricken and I feel like I might explode or something...

May I ask you a personal question sir?

GEORGE

Of course.

KENNY

Do you ever get high?

George stops walking.

GEORGE

How old do I look to you?

KENNY

Have you ever taken any drugs sir?
 
30.

GEORGE

Of course, Kenny.

KENNY

Like what?

GEORGE

I	shouldnʼt really be discussing this with you on campus Mr. Potter.

George begins walking and Kenny follows.

KENNY

Itʼs the only way I get by sometimes. Have you ever tried mescaline?

GEORGE

Not my drug of choice. I shaved off one of my eyebrows once on mescaline. Not a good look for me.

KENNY

Sir?

GEORGE

I looked in the mirror - big mistake if youʼre high on mescaline

-	and decided that my eyebrows were taking over my face and before I knew it, I had shaved one off. I wore a band-aid over my eye for about 6 weeks while my brow grew in. Very embarrassing.

KENNY

You didnʼt take it again after that?

George stops.

GEORGE

Kenny, have you been listening to me? I shaved off my eyebrow. I wanted an experience Mr. Potter, not a career on stage.
 
31.

KENNY

If you ever want to get high sir, I usually have some dope.

GEORGE

Youʼre really mad arenʼt you?

KENNY

Sorry, sir. I guess you donʼt feel very comfortable talking like this.

GEORGE

What makes you say that?

KENNY

Lois thinks youʼre kind of cagey. Like this morning, when you were listening to all that crap we were talking about Huxley...

GEORGE

Well, not all of you. I didnʼt notice you open your mouth once.

KENNY

I was watching you.

George is surprised and intrigued.

KENNY (CONTʼD)

You let us ramble on and on and then you straighten us out - but you never really tell us everything you know about something.

GEORGE

Well, maybe thatʼs true up to a point.

GEORGE (CONTʼD)

Itʼs not that I want to be cagey. I canʼt really discuss things completely openly at school. Someone would misunderstand... I tried to do that today. It doesnʼt work.
 
32.

INT. SAN TOMAS COLLEGE - CAMPUS BOOKSTORE. DAY CONTINUOUS

Kenny seems to be thinking over what George has said as the two men enter the bookstore. Kenny picks up a red pencil sharpener from a display on the counter and a note book.

KENNY

What was it you wanted to get sir?

GEORGE

Nothing. I was on my way to the

Deanʼs office.

KENNY

You mean you walked all the way down here just to talk to me?

GEORGE

Why not?

KENNY

Well, I think you deserve something for that. Here sir, take your pick. Itʼs on me.

Kenny waves his hand across the multicolored display of pencil sharpeners.

GEORGE

Thank you.

George chooses a yellow one.

KENNY

I thought youʼd probably pick blue.

Kenny pays the cashier.

GEORGE

Why blue?

KENNY

Isnʼt blue supposed to be

spiritual?
 
33.

GEORGE

What makes you think Iʼm spiritual?

And you? Red?

KENNY

Whatʼs red stand for?

GEORGE

Lots of things. Rage. Lust.

KENNY

No kidding?

Kenny looks George straight in the eye.

KENNY (CONTʼD)

See you around, sir.

Kenny smiles and walks away leaving George staring after him.

INT. SAN TOMAS COLLEGE - GEORGEʼS OFFICE. DAY -- LATER

George is cleaning up his office. He is arranging the insides of his drawers and throwing things into the garbage can. It is all immaculate. His desk is absolutely bare with the exception of three file folders carefully labeled and laid out precisely on his desk top.

George sits down and sighs. He rests his head in his hands for a few moments and rubs his temples.

He opens his briefcase, searching for something. He locates a bottle of aspirin, and empties 3 tablets into his hand.

He opens his lower desk drawer and pulls out a near empty bottle of scotch. He unscrews the cap and finishes the bottle off, as he washes down the aspirin.

He picks up the phone and dials a number.

CHARLEY (O.S.)

Hello?
 
34.

GEORGE

What are you up to kiddo?

INT. CHARLEYʼS HOUSE - DRESSING ROOM. DAY -- CONTINUOUS

Charleyʼs hair is teased up but has not yet had itʼs final brush out and last coat of lacquer. Her foundation is on but the rest of her makeup is not yet done and her face is matte beige. She has a picture ripped out of Vogue on her dresser top about how to achieve the “Perfect Doe Eye”. One eye is made up and the other is bare. We are staring at her in a magnifying mirror. There are dresses strewn around the room. A Serge Gainsbourg record is playing in the background.

CHARLEY

Just trying to finish up a book.

Howʼs your day going?

GEORGE (O.S)

Fine. I was just getting ready to leave school and wanted to know if you needed anything for tonight?

CHARLEY

Youʼre sweet, but thanks, I think

Iʼm all set.

She is looking at herself in the magnifying mirror.

CHARLEY (CONTʼD)

Oh, could you pick up a bottle of Gin for me? Tangueray? I love the color of the bottle.

INT. SAN TOMAS COLLEGE - GEORGEʼS OFFICE. DAY - CONTINUOUS

GEORGE

You love whatʼs in it. What time do you want me?

CHARLEY (O.S.)

7:00 would be great if thatʼs OK with you.
 
35.

GEORGE

Perfect. Iʼll see you tonight.

INT. CHARLEYʼS HOUSE - BEDROOM. DAY -- CONTINUOUS

CHARLEY

Iʼll see you then. Bye Geo.

GEORGE (O.S.)

Good-bye kiddo.

She hangs up the phone and starts back to work on her face. She does a little dance move to the record and stares into the mirror.

CHARLEY

Beautiful...

INT. SAN TOMAS COLLEGE - GEORGEʼS OFFICE. DAY - CONTINUOUS

We cut back to GEORGEʼS P.O.V. He looks at the clock on the wall. 2:20. George takes one of the folders off of his desk and slips it into his briefcase as he walks to the door.

He turns, and looks around the room for a moment.

He turns off the light and closes the door as he leaves.

EXT. SAN TOMAS COLLEGE - CAMPUS. DAY -- MOMENTS LATER

Exiting the faculty building, George crosses the campus to the parking lot.

INT. SAN TOMAS COLLEGE - GEORGEʼS JAGUAR SEDAN. PARKING LOT DAY

George is inside his car with his briefcase open. He is looking for his car keys. He spots the handle of the gun and wraps his fingers around it. He is deep in thought.

There is a loud startling knock on Georgeʼs window. Itʼs Kenny. He is on his motorcycle and has pulled up next to George. He turns off his motor. George rolls down the car window. George is in a dark mood as he quickly closes the
 
36.

briefcase, irritated that he has been disturbed.

GEORGE

Yes, Mr. Potter?

KENNY

Are you going somewhere sir?

GEORGE

That is usually why people get into their cars.

KENNY

No, I mean are you going on

vacation or something?

GEORGE

What?

KENNY

I saw you cleaning out your office.

Georgeʼs face goes pale.

GEORGE

What is it that you really want

Kenny?

KENNY

I was just hoping that perhaps we could get together for a drink or something sometime.

GEORGE

And why is that?

KENNY

I donʼt know sir. Because I think you might like it. I mean, because you seem as though you could use a friend.

GEORGE

Oh really?
 
37.

KENNY

(sincerely)

Yes sir, you do.

George looks Kenny in the eyes. He is touched by Kennyʼs concern.

GEORGE

Well, you might be right Kenny, but weʼll have to make it another time. Iʼm late. (beat) But thank you for the invitation. And thank you for the talk earlier. And stay away from the mescaline.

George starts his car and pulls out of the driveway and onto a winding side street leaving Kenny sitting on his motorcycle in the parking lot.

INT. SANTA MONICA NATIONAL BANK. DAY -- LATER

George passes a security guard who nods at him.

As George walks up to a desk marked “Safe Deposit”, a pretty brunette, BANK TELLER, greets him. She clearly finds him attractive.

BANK TELLER

Hello Mr. Falconer.

GEORGE

Hello. How are you today?

BANK TELLER

Fine, sir. Do you need to get into your box?

INT. SANTA MONICA NATIONAL BANK - SAFE DEPOSIT BOX VIEWING ROOM. DAY -- MINUTES LATER

BANK TELLER

Here you are sir. Can you sign here please?

George signs.
 
38.

GEORGE

Thank you.

As the teller leaves, George opens the box and slowly empties the contents.

He pulls out folded documents and pushes them into his briefcase.

He takes out a slim gold wedding band, looks at it for a moment and then slips it onto his little finger next to his signet ring.

A black and white photograph in the box catches Georgeʼs eye.

INSERT PHOTO: it is a nude picture of Jim lying on a large boulder in the sun.

As George stares at the photo, he closes his eyes.

FLASHBACK - EXT. JOSHUA TREE STATE PARK. DAY (1947)

A CLOSE UP SHOT OF SKIN AND THE BACK OF A MANʼS NECK IN HARSH SUN. THERE IS A SOUND OF RUSTLING PALM LEAVES AND WIND. WE SLIDE ALONG A MANʼS BODY AND ARE SUDDENLY PULLED OVER AND ARE FACE UP IN THE GLARING SUN. THE LIGHT FLARES AS WE PULL BACK TO REVEAL AN EXPANSE OF STUNNING AND ODD LOOKING PREHISTORIC DESERT.

SEVERAL LINGERING SHOTS OF THE LANDSCAPE AND SOUNDS OF THE DESERT CAPTURE THE REMOTE AND BEAUTIFUL EMPTINESS OF IT ALL.

George, 38, and Jim, 21, lay on a large smooth boulder on a high cliff edge, propped up on their elbows, admiring the peaceful and seemingly empty desert. There is a camera in the foreground. Jim is buttoning up his pants.

JIM

So explain your friend Charlotte to me.

GEORGE

What would you like to know?
 
39.

JIM

You seem very... I donʼt know... intimate I guess. Like you were once together. You havenʼt ever slept with her have you?

GEORGE

Yes. A few times when we were young. I donʼt mean to say that it didnʼt mean anything to me but, Iʼm afraid it meant a good deal more to Charley. It was a long time ago in London. It didnʼt work out very well. I love Charley and we are very close friends but thatʼs all.

JIM

Iʼm confused. If you sleep with women then why are you with me?

GEORGE

Because I fall in love with men. Because I fell in love with you. Anyway, doesnʼt everyone sleep with women when theyʼre young?

JIM

I havenʼt.

GEORGE

Youʼre joking.

JIM

No. Iʼm not. It was just never anything that interested me.

GEORGE

Well. Youʼre awfully modern arenʼt you? You know, that was the first thing that I noticed about you was how sure of yourself you were. How can you be so sure about everything at your age?

JIM

You think Iʼm sure of myself?
 
40.

GEORGE

Of course you are.

George lets his hand brush against Jimʼs. Jim looks at George then breaks into a great smile.

END FLASHBACK

INT. SANTA MONICA NATIONAL BANK - SAFE DEPOSIT BOX VIEWING ROOM. DAY

George slips the photo into his jacket pocket. He closes the empty box and picks up the beige phone on the desk.

GEORGE

Iʼm finished now. Thank you.

INT. SANTA MONICA NATIONAL BANK. DAY -- MINUTES LATER

BANK TELLER

Yes, Mr. Falconer... Is there something else we can help you with today?

George is looking through his briefcase.

GEORGE

I canʼt find my check book and I need some cash. Not my day Iʼm afraid. Excuse me a minute.

George sits down on a trim upholstered sofa and starts to look carefully through his briefcase.

Into our frame come two perfect, tiny blue patent leather shoes.

George looks up to see Jennifer Strunk. Her beauty is almost alarming. Her blue eyes match the color of her tiny shoes. She stares at George intently.

OUR CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY OVER THE TINY GIRL, LITERALLY DRINKING IN HER FRESH BEAUTY. WE SEE THE TINY BLONDE HAIRS ON HER LEGS AND ARMS. WE STOP ON HER EYES AND OUR CAMERA ZOOMS INTO THE DEEP BLUE OF HER EYES. WE HEAR HER LIGHT
 
41.

BREATH. HER GOLDEN LASHES BAT IN SLOW MOTION AND THE SOUND OF THE BREEZE CREATED BY THEM IS AMPLIFIED.

George is dumbstruck. The little girl looks up at him with absolute innocence. She is holding a small glass terrarium.

JENNIFER

Mommy says bushy eyebrows are pedestrian, but I think yours are pretty.

GEORGE

Well I think yours are pretty too.

JENNIFER

Why do you look so sad? Would you like to meet Charlton Heston?

GEORGE

What?

Jennifer holds out her terrarium. It has paper columns glued around the outside and inside is a large black scorpion and a small spider clinging to a stick.

JENNIFER

Ben Hur. Our scorpion. Every night we throw in something new to him and watch him kill it. Daddy says itʼs like the colosseum so my brother Tom glued on all the columns. He wants to be a set designer. He hasnʼt eaten the spider yet cause heʼs still full from the moth we gave him last night. Daddy said heʼd like to throw you in the colosseum.

GEORGE

No kidding. Why?

JENNIFER

He says youʼre light in your loafers but you arenʼt even wearing loafers. I think my brother Tom is
(MORE)
 
42.

JENNIFER (CONTʼD)

light in his loafers too but he

wears Keds. Last week he made me do

a conditioning treatment on my hair

with eggs. Does it look shiny?

Mrs. Strunk appears suddenly. She looks lovely with her light brown hair swept up in a french twist.

MRS. STRUNK

Sweetheart, what are you doing

bothering Mr. Falconer?

GEORGE

Sheʼs not bothering me at all

Susan. How are you?

MRS. STRUNK

Iʼm glad to see you George... George, weʼre having a few people over tonight for drinks and would love to have you join us if you could.

GEORGE

Thank you, itʼs very kind of you but Iʼm afraid that I have plans tonight.

MRS. STRUNK

Well, another time then. Come on Jennifer. Letʼs let Mr. Falconer get back to his banking. Goodbye George.

GEORGE

Goodbye Susan. Goodbye Jennifer.

The two women walk away and George looks after them with a faint smile. Jennifer turns and stares back at George and flashes her blue eyes at him.

He is left smiling back at her.

INT. SPORTING GOODS STORE. LATE AFTERNOON -- MINUTES LATER
 
43.

There are rows of guns on the wall behind the counter and innocuous music plays in the background. A YOUNG BOY, 14, is behind the counter helping a PRETTY BLONDE GIRL with a rifle.

George walks up to the counter and places his gun down.

YOUNG BOY

May I help you sir?

GEORGE

I need a box of bullets for this gun.

YOUNG BOY

Yes sir.

The boy picks up the gun and looks at it.

YOUNG BOY (CONTʼD) This is a really old gun sir. We have a two for one sale on handguns at the moment. Perhaps one for the little lady?

GEORGE

No thanks. Just the bullets please.

George hands the boy money for the bullets.

EXT. LIQUOR STORE. PARKING LOT. LATE AFTERNOON

A giant billboard for PSYCHO featuring only Janet Leighʼs eyes completely fills our frame as Georgeʼs car pulls into our shot. George parks and gets out of the car and walks towards the liquor store.

The sun is low in the sky, and the sky is now a dirty shade of pale orange.

As George passes a late model car, a dog is barking hysterically and looking out of the driverʼs side window at George. It is a smooth, black and white fox terrier. George stops in his tracks, approaches the car and stares in the window as the dog becomes silent and looks George in the eyes.
 
44.

Just then a YOUNG WOMAN returns to the car.

YOUNG WOMAN

Iʼm sorry. I hope she didnʼt growl at you. She goes kind of crazy sometimes when I have to leave her in the car.

The Young Woman opens her car door and pushes the dog aside with her bag.

GEORGE

Sheʼs perfect. Whatʼs her name?

The Young Woman gets inside and rolls down the window. The dog climbs onto her lap and puts her front paws on the car door.

YOUNG WOMAN

India.

GEORGE

I used to have smooth fox terriers.

You donʼt see them very often.

OUR SHOT IS CLOSE ON INDIA AS GEORGE MOVES IN AND TAKES A DEEP BREATH OF INDIAʼS NECK AND EAR. HE NUZZLES HER AND BREATHES DEEPLY. THE SOUND OF HIS DEEP INHALE IS AMPLIFIED.

GEORGE (CONTʼD)

Sheʼs still a puppy isnʼt she?

George pulls back. The Young Woman is slightly taken aback by George but flattered. She nods and then smiles.

YOUNG WOMAN

Have a nice evening.

GEORGE

You too. Good night India.

George watches as the car pulls away. India now on the passenger seat looks back at George.

George heads toward the front of the store.
 
45.

As George walks toward the door we see CARLOS, 20, a hustler in a leather jacket, tight jeans, boots and a t-shirt loitering near a pay phone smoking a cigarette. He is very handsome in a cheap way and locks eyes with George as George enters the electric doors.

George looks away uncomfortably.

EXT. LIQUOR STORE. LATE AFTERNOON -- MOMENTS LATER.

As George exits the liquor store with two bottles in brown paper bags, Carlos turns to enter and the two men walk right into each other as Georgeʼs gin crashes to the ground.

CARLOS

Man, Iʼm sorry about that.

GEORGE

Itʼs OK.

Carlosʼ pack of cigarettes is on the ground covered in gin and glass.

GEORGE (CONTʼD)

It was my fault. Iʼll get you

another pack.

Carlos smiles and looks right into Georgeʼs eyes.

CARLOS

Donʼt worry about it.

GEORGE

No, no I insist.

INT. LIQUOR STORE. LATE AFTERNOON -- MOMENTS LATER

The CASHIER slips Georgeʼs bottle of gin into a brown paper bag and hands him a pack of Lucky Strikes and a book of matches. George hands the cashier a 10 dollar bill and she gives him change.

CASHIER

Thank you sir.
 
46.

The cashier glares at Carlos as he walks towards the door.

GEORGE

Iʼm sorry about the broken glass.

Thank you.

George hands the cigarettes to Carlos.

GEORGE (CONTʼD)

Here you go.

CARLOS

Thanks man.

Carlos opens the pack as the two of them walk through the glass doors.

EXT. LIQUOR STORE. LATE AFTERNOON -- CONTINUOUS

CARLOS

You want one?

GEORGE

No thanks.

George stares into Carlosʼ face. His beauty is stunning.

GEORGE (CONTʼD)

Well, yes actually. Why not. Thank you.

George takes a cigarette and Carlos lights it as George gazes into his eyes.

CLOSE UP SHOTS OF CARLOSʼ EYES AND LASHES. DETAILS OF HIS MOUTH, BICEPS, HANDS. A SHOT OF HIS NECK. WE ALMOST FEEL HIM SIGH AS HE EXHALES. THE SOUND OF HIS BREATHING IS SLIGHTLY AMPLIFIED.

CARLOS

Carlos.

GEORGE

What did you say?
 
47.

CARLOS

Carlos. You asked me my name. Are you OK?

GEORGE

Oh, yeah, yeah. Iʼm sorry.

George takes a last deep inhale as he looks Carlos up and down and then settles on his face.

GEORGE (CONTʼD)

(in perfect Spanish)

Wow. Youʼre really something. You have an incredible face. Enjoy that. Itʼs a great gift.

CARLOS

(in Spanish)

Your Spanish is perfect.

GEORGE

(in Spanish)

Thanks. I should have used it more.

CARLOS

(in Spanish)

Itʼs not too late.

George stubs out his cigarette and then reaches into his jacket pocket and pulls out a 20 dollar bill. He hands it to Carlos.

George walks toward his car and starts to get in, but as he does he notices Carlos trying to open the locked passenger door.

Our shot is from the front of the car, taking in the sky in the background which has turned a vivid pink.

GEORGE

What are you doing?

CARLOS

Arenʼt we going somewhere?
 
48.

GEORGE

No. But, thanks.

Looking up at the sky, George stops and stares at it.

CARLOS

(in Spanish)

You know itʼs the smog that makes it that color.

GEORGE

Iʼve never seen a sky like this before.

CARLOS

(in Spanish)

Sometimes awful things have their own kind of beauty.

George looks at Carlos, struck by his comment.

GEORGE

Could I have another cigarette?

CARLOS

Sure.

George walks around to the back of the car. Carlos gives George a cigarette and places one in his own mouth, strikes a match and lights Georgeʼs cigarette and then his own.

George and Carlos sit on the trunk of the car and stare at the sky.

CARLOS (CONTʼD)

You sure that you donʼt want to go for a drive?

GEORGE

Iʼm sure. (Beat) Where are you from?

CARLOS

Madrid.
 
49.

GEORGE

Madrid? How did you get here?

CARLOS

Itʼs a long story. I met a guy from LA at the hotel where I worked who told me I could live with him and that he could get me an agent. I never realized that I had a Spanish accent.

GEORGE

I like your accent. You speak very well. How did you learn English?

CARLOS

My mom had an American boyfriend when I was little.

GEORGE

Is your mother in Madrid?

CARLOS

Yeah. She cuts hair. She cut my hair before I left. Do you like it? I thought it made me look like James Dean.

GEORGE

You look better than James Dean.

CARLOS

Really? Thanks. (beat) No one has ever picked me up and not wanted something.

GEORGE

I think you picked me up. (Beat) Today is kind of a serious day for me.

CARLOS

Come on. What could be so serious for a guy like you?
 
50.

GEORGE

Oh, Iʼm just trying to get over an old love I guess.

CARLOS

My mother always says that lovers are like buses. You just have to wait a little while and another one comes along.

George stubs out his cigarette.

GEORGE

You have a smart mother. Iʼve got to go.

CARLOS

(in Spanish)

You seem like all you really need is someone to like you. Iʼm a nice guy you know.

George goes around to the drivers side of the car and starts to get in.

GEORGE

Thanks, but Iʼm going away.

George backs up the car and waves quickly to Carlos as he pulls out of the parking lot.

Carlos stares after the car.

INT. GEORGEʼS HOUSE - BATHROOM. EVENING

George, in a crisp white shirt with french cuffs, is washing his hands and dressing for dinner as a very loud cocktail party sound blasts from the Strunk house.

George looks out his window to survey all of this.

The Strunk lawn is pristine, flower beds immaculate, and the guests are arriving. All are dressed in their best, chic cocktail outfits and the driveway is full of sleek, late-model cars.
 
51.

INT. GEORGEʼS HOUSE - BEDROOM. EVENING -- MOMENTS LATER

George is increasingly irritated at the sound of the party.

He walks over to his Hi Fi and starts to put on a record.

As he does he glances back at the sofa.....

FLASHBACK - INT. GEORGEʼS HOUSE - STUDY. NIGHT (1961)

Jim and George are stretched out on the small sofa reading with their heads at opposite ends. A fire is burning in the fireplace.

There is a beer on the floor at Jimʼs end and a scotch on the floor at Georgeʼs end.

The female dog is tucked up between them and the male is stretched out on the fl oor as a record ends and starts to scratch back and forth.

GEORGE

Itʼs your turn to change it.

JIM

Iʼm not changing it. Itʼs your turn. You wonʼt like what I put on anyway.

GEORGE

Oh, please, please. Come on. Iʼll give you five dollars if you change it. Please. I donʼt want to. Iʼm too old to get up.

JIM

Youʼre only old when itʼs convenient for you to be old. What are you reading?

George flashes the cover of Kafkaʼs Metamorphosis at him.

JIM (CONTʼD)

Oh no. Not that depressing crap again.
 
52.

GEORGE

Itʼs for my class. And what highbrow work of fiction might you be reading?

Jim flashes the cover of Breakfast at Tiffanyʼs.

GEORGE (CONTʼD)

Hmmm.

JIM

Donʼt be so smug.

The dog on the floor sits up.

JIM (CONTʼD)

(to the dog)

And just what do you want?

GEORGE

He wants to go out.

JIM

Of course he does. What a life he has. Donʼt you envy him?

GEORGE

Why, because he gets to sniff

anyoneʼs ass he wants to?

JIM

Nice. I envy him because he just does what he wants. Like yesterday I was standing in the front yard, and Susan came over to talk for a minute and that little brat of hers, Christopher came running over with that damned gun of his. Well, our little dog walked right up, looked straight ahead, hiked his leg and peed all over Christopherʼs new tennis shoes. And all over Christopher actually. He and his

53.

JIM (CONTʼD)

mother both started shrieking and I had to act like I was upset, when it was all I could do to keep from laughing. It was so perfectly executed after all the times those kids have tortured that poor dog. I wish you had seen it.

They both laugh and look at the dog who knows that he is being spoken about.

JIM (CONTʼD)

You should take a lesson from him. He doesnʼt stay up all night worrying. Heʼs figured out how to get the two of us to do exactly what he wants. They are both basically very sophisticated little parasites when you think about it.

GEORGE

Well, the dumbest creatures are the happiest. Just look at your mother.

JIM

Youʼre an ass. What I mean is, he really just lives in the moment. Like now. What could be better than this? Tucked up here with you. If I died right now it would be OK.

GEORGE

Well, it wouldnʼt be OK with me so shut up and go change the record.

JIM

Good answer.

Jim starts to get up.

JIM (CONTʼD)

I was going to take them with me to Denver next week if itʼs OK with

JIM (CONTʼD)

probably that recognition of a

similar mind.

Jim kisses George on the forehead.

JIM (CONTʼD)

Oh, you stay there old man. You owe me five bucks.

END FLASHBACK

INT. GEORGEʼS HOUSE - BEDROOM. EVENING

George looks towards the Strunk house again. He is irritated at the noise from the party and puts on the record.

INT. GEORGEʼS HOUSE - BEDROOM. EVENING -- MOMENTS LATER

Opera music is now blaring.

George, is re-arranging the items on his desk.

He takes a dark suit out of the closet and lays it across the empty end of the desk top. He goes over to his dresser, pulls out a shirt, takes a pair of gold cuff links out of an ebony box on the dresser top and lays these out next to the suit.

He goes back to his closet and grabs two different ties. He stands over the suit weighing the two different tie options. He chooses one, lays it on the shirt carefully and returns the other one to the closet.

He carefully writes out something in bold type on a small piece of paper and pins it to the tie that he has laid out with the shirt. He takes a note marked “Charley” from the desk top and lays this on top of the suit.

George goes to his closet, takes out a pair of black capped toe shoes and places them on the desk next to the suit. The shoes are perfectly polished. He stands back and surveys his desk.
 
55.

OUR SHOT FROM ABOVE REVEALS THE GUN AND BULLETS IN THE CENTER OF THE DESK. WE SLOWLY PULL BACK FROM THE GUN TO REVEAL THE ENTIRE DESK TOP. IT IS A COMPLEX BUT PRECISE ARRANGEMENT OF LETTERS, BILLS, HOUSE DEEDS, A DOCUMENT MARKED THE LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT OF GEORGE CARLYLE FALCONER, AND 3 CAREFULLY LABELED KEYS. THE LARGE BOX AT THE END OF THE DESK IS MARKED “CHARLEY”. THE OTHER END OF THE DESK IS DOMINATED BY THE OUTFIT THAT GEORGE ASSEMBLED EARLIER. IT IS NOW LAID OUT WITH THE SHIRT AND TIE INSERTED IN THE JACKET AND A NOTE THAT SAYS “WINDSOR KNOT” AT THE NECK.

George takes the gun from his desk and goes over to his side of the bed. He lays down. He opens his mouth and carefully inserts the tip of the gun. He lies like this for a moment, sits up, looks at the wall behind him and the pillows on the bed and gets up and heads toward the bathroom with the gun in his hand.

INT. GEORGEʼS HOUSE - BATHROOM. EVENING -- CONTINUOUS

George gets into the shower and pulls the shower curtain closed. Our shot is from the OUTSIDE OF THE SHOWER and we can see Georgeʼs silhouette as he raises the gun to his mouth. He turns and looks behind himself. He repeats the motion of placing the gun in his mouth but this time falls back against the wall and slides down it. George yanks the curtain open and goes out of the door and down the hall.

INT. GEORGEʼS HOUSE - BEDROOM. EVENING -- MOMENTS LATER

George comes back into the bedroom with a red flannel sleeping bag. The gun is still in his hand. He unrolls the sleeping bag and places it on the bed. He gets in and zips it up over his head. We can see by the shape of the sleeping bag that he has raised the gun to his mouth. Just as he does this, the phone rings. George freezes for a moment, then gets out of the sleeping bag and crosses the room. He places the gun on his desk and answers the phone.

GEORGE

No, I did not forget the gin. Iʼll see you in ten minutes

He hangs up the phone and heads down the hall.
 
56.

EXT. GEORGEʼS HOUSE - KITCHEN. EVENING -- MINUTES LATER

George is standing at the kitchen counter putting the finishing touches on a note.

He is now dressed in a blazer with gold buttons, grey slacks and black loafers. He has clearly made an effort to look handsome.

He folds the note around a stack of one hundred dollar bills and puts it into an envelope. He writes ALVA on the outside of the envelope, goes to the bread box and pulls out a new loaf of bread.

He opens the wrapper and slides the envelope in so that it is visible through the plastic. He closes the wrapper and places the loaf of bread in the freezer.

He grabs the liquor bottles and heads out the door.

EXT. GEORGEʼS HOUSE - DRIVEWAY. NIGHT -- MINUTES LATER

George leaves his house and begins to walk down his driveway. The Strunk cocktail party is now in full swing and two couples are being greeted at the front door by Mr. Strunk.

All of a sudden, Christopher Strunk jumps out of the bushes with his toy machine gun and starts shooting at George. George stares down at the little boy.

CUT TO:

Our sound fades as George slowly turns towards the boy, unzips his fly, and unleashes a steady stream of piss all over the stunned kid who starts screaming hysterically.

CUT BACK TO:

Our sound snaps back. George is still staring at Christopher who is shooting away. Georgeʼs stare brings the little boy to a stop.

GEORGE

Christopher, would you like it if I killed you?

CHRISTOPHER

I donʼt know.
 
57.

GEORGE

Well, if you keep it up we are going to find out, so go home and stop shooting at people.

Christopher glares at George.

George offers a quick salutation and a broad smile to Mr.

Strunk and then turns and walks up the road.

EXT. STAIRS TO SOLEDAD WAY. NIGHT -- MINUTES LATER

George walks up the stairs with his bottles of liquor.

EXT. CHARLEYʼS HOUSE - DRIVEWAY. NIGHT

George walks towards the house. He stares at the door a moment before ringing the bell.

George is stunned by the beauty of the lush pink climbing roses next to Charleyʼs door. He leans in to smell one and closes his eyes.

Charley opens the door.

CHARLEY

Geo.

OUR CAMERA DRINKS CHARLIE IN:

Charley is dressed in a graphic black and white evening dress that is clearly a few years ahead of itʼs time. Her strawberry blonde shoulder-length hair is teased and piled on her head in a stylish coif that clearly took a great deal of time to achieve. This is Charley at her best and not the same Charley we saw earlier.

She has made quite an effort and she looks beautiful. She kisses George on the cheek as they embrace.

A QUICK FLASHBACK OF GEORGE SOBBING IN THE RAIN IN CHARLEYʼS ARMS.

Back to the present, George pulls away from Charley.
 
58.

GEORGE

You look divine. As chic as ever.

George is genuinely happy to see Charley.

CHARLEY

Come on in.

INT. CHARLEYʼS HOUSE - ENTRY HALL. NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS

George follows Charley as they walk together through the house.

CHARLEY

Oh God. It smells awfully of

cooking in here doesnʼt it?

GEORGE

It smells great. Iʼm starving.

Whereʼs Louisa?

INT. CHARLEYʼS HOUSE - SUN ROOM. NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS

CHARLEY

I gave her the night off. Iʼm

cooking myself.

GEORGE

You are?

CHARLEY

Yes, and Iʼm trying something new.

GEORGE

Charley darling, you cooking is new.

CHARLEY

Donʼt be smart. Iʼm in a good mood tonight and Iʼm going to be fun. Iʼve made two early New Years resolutions. One, no more talk about awful ex-husbands and children who donʼt give a damn.
 
59.

GEORGE

And the other one?

CHARLEY

One what?

GEORGE

Resolution.

CHARLEY

Oh, resolution number two! More smoking and more drinking and screw it all! So, come mix me up a drink. Iʼll have a gin and tonic please and watch out baby!

GEORGE

Coming up.

INT. CHARLEYʼS HOUSE - LIVING ROOM. NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS

The interior of the living room is almost all white. This is very definitely the house of a stylish woman. There is a white shag carpet on the floor, a fire burning, a large curved sectional sofa in the center of the room and an elaborate dining table set for two in a window at the far end of the room.

As they walk into the living room George turns to the well stocked drinks table and mixes them both a drink.

Charley sits down on the sofa in front of the fire.

CHARLEY

It was sweet of you to come

tonight.

GEORGE

Sweet had nothing to do with it. I needed to see you
