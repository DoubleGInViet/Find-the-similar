CHARLEY

Oh come off it. Whenever you do something sweet, youʼre too ashamed to admit it.
 
60.

George hands Charley her drink and sits down next to her.

GEORGE

To our early New Years Resolutions.

CHARLEY

And just what are your resolutions

by the way?

GEORGE

To let go of the past. Completely, entirely, and forever.

They raise their glasses and smile at each other. Charley looks George up and down.

CHARLEY

Light me up Geo, will you...

Charley looks Geo in the eyes. George leans forward for the table lighter.

CHARLEY (CONT’D)

Darling, you don’t look well. Do you remember when you had your little heart attack last year?

GEORGE

It wasn’t a heart attack.

CHARLEY

Well whatever it was darling you don’t look so hot.

GEORGE

I’m great. Never been better. Just tired. I haven’t been sleeping.

CHARLEY

Geo, it’s normal. You were with Jim for 16 years. I think about Richard everyday too. It’s hard being alone. At least you have a job and a life.

(beat) Let’s have a bit of dinner shall we? Because I’ve worked so hard...
 
61.

INT. CHARLEYʼS HOUSE - LIVING ROOM. NIGHT -- LATER

Theyʼve finished their dinner, and a bottle of champagne.

CHARLEY

Really?

Charley lights another cigarette.

CHARLEY (CONTʼD)

What are you talking about?

GEORGE

Seriously, “old” doesnʼt exist

anymore. A student yesterday called

me a “senior citizen”.

CHARLEY

I	wouldnʼt mind if “old” didnʼt exist, but Iʼm not sure “senior” is what Iʼm shooting for either.

Charley catches a refl ection of herself in the glass of the window and smooths her cheek up a bit with her well manicured hand.

GEORGE

Itʼs all becoming so bland... itʼs not why I came to America. Itʼs like a complete breakdown of culture and manners.

CHARLEY

Well, the young ones have no manners. The other day at the car wash I had a young man look me up and down and actually ask me if I was a natural blonde!

GEORGE

No. What did you say?

CHARLEY

I looked him straight in the eye (MORE)
 
62.

CHARLEY (CONTʼD)

and said: “Well, letʼs just say

that if I stood on my head I would

be a natural brunette with lovely

breath.”

GEORGE

You did not!

CHARLEY

I did! And the amusing thing was that it went right over his head! They both laugh hysterically.

GEORGE

You had a mouth on you even back in London. Do you remember that old lesbian who threw her drink at you because you asked her if she was hung like a donut!?

They practically fall out of their chairs laughing at this one. Their laughing tapers off as Charley takes a drag on her cigarette. There is a quiet, sweet pause between them.

CHARLEY

Oh Geo, we could always go back to

London. The two of us.

GEORGE

No thanks.

CHARLEY

You know you miss it.

GEORGE

Sometimes I miss it. Maybe if Jim had lived. He loved England. He really wanted us to stay the last time we were there.

CHARLEY

Do you really think you would have moved?
 
63.

GEORGE

Oh, I donʼt know. Itʼs silly to even talk about it. It was just a fantasy.

Charley reaches over and holds his hand. As she does, she fondles his little finger and notices the addition of the slim gold band.

CHARLEY

Whatʼs this?

George pulls his hand away.

GEORGE

My motherʼs wedding ring. I found it when I was cleaning out a drawer. Charlotte dear, we are both in need of another drink.

George stands up, grabs their two empty glasses, and heads back to the drinks table as Charley watches, clearly still very much in love.

Charley gets up and puts on a record and then crosses the room to where George is mixing the drinks and slides up behind him affectionately.

George smiles as Charley embraces him from behind and lays her head on his shoulder.

Much to her surprise he turns around, takes her hand, and grabs her around the waist as they begin to slow dance.

George buries his head in Charleyʼs neck and squeezes her close. We hear the sound of her bracelets and George feels the brush of her earrings as he literally drinks her in.

They are drunk and adorable together as the pace of the music slows and George starts to pull away.

Charley in an attempt to keep things going stops dancing and runs across the room to change the record.
 
64.

CHARLEY

Wait, wait, wait! Donʼt move. I

LOVE this.

She puts on a wild record as George begins to laugh against his will.

GEORGE

You are insane!

CHARLEY

Come on old man!

The music blares and the two of them go crazy. Charley is quite a sexy dancer as is George. He twists lower and lower as the two of them have a Watusi competition all the time laughing.

As Charley shakes her head and goes wild, she loses her balance in her mules and falls back onto George. The two of them fall to the floor laughing.

They are both flat on their backs as Charley slides into a comfortable spot under Georgeʼs arm with her head on his shoulder.

They slowly calm down and their laughter turns to sweet smiles of exhausted, drunken contentment as the record dies down and turns itself off.

They look blissful lying on the white shag carpet as they regain their breath.

GEORGE

Donʼt move.

George jumps up, slips off his jacket and tosses a few pillows to the floor. He grabs their drinks, Charleyʼs pink cigarettes and an ashtray and heads back to her.

He slides back down next to her, lights two cigarettes at the same time, gives one to her, and takes the other one for himself.

CHARLEY

Very smooth cigarette move.
 
65.

GEORGE

Iʼve always wanted to do that.

CHARLEY

You donʼt even smoke.

GEORGE

Well, not for the last 16 years. Jim hated. Whatʼs to stop me now. Itʼs not as if itʼs going to kill me is it?

They both laugh and blow smoke into the air.

CHARLEY

This is so nice lying here with you. Donʼt you ever miss this? What we could have been to each other? Having a real relationship and kids?

GEORGE

(stunned)

I had Jim.

CHARLEY

I know, but I mean a real relationship. Geo, letʼs be honest, what you and Jim had was great but wasnʼt it really just a substitute for something else?

George sits up and looks directly at Charley.

GEORGE

Is that really what you think after all of these years? That Jim was just a substitute for real love?

George really loses his temper.

GEORGE (CONTʼD)

Jim wasnʼt a substitute for

anything, and there is no

substitute for Jim, anywhere! And

(MORE)
 
66.

GEORGE (CONTʼD)

by the way, what was so REAL about your relationship with Richard? He left you after 9 years! Jim and

I were together for 16 years and if he hadnʼt died we would still be together! What the hell is not REAL about that!?

George, disgusted, gets up and stands in front of the fire.

He stands dead still for a moment trying to compose himself.

Charley is stunned and doesnʼt move.

Charley has been stung by Georgeʼs comments about her marriage.

CHARLEY

I didnʼt mean it the way it sounded. I know how much the two of you loved each other.

CHARLEY (CONTʼD)

I just suppose that I was always a bit jealous that you and I never had that kind of love. Actually Iʼve never had that kind of love with anyone. I donʼt think Richard ever loved me except for the way I looked. And Clay, I donʼt know. You raise a child and love it and then when they get old enough they just leave.

GEORGE

Charlotte, there is nothing wrong with your life. You like feeling sorry for yourself. Itʼs one of your great pleasures.

CHARLEY

And itʼs not one of yours? Youʼre as pathetic as I am.

GEORGE

Feeling sorry for myself is definitely not one of my great pleasures.
 
67.

Charley struggles to stand up.

CHARLEY

Well its not one of mine either. I donʼt like feeling sorry for myself one bit. I tried to hold onto Richard for so long even when it was obvious to everyone but me that it was over. Now Clay is grown up. I mean, what am I doing here Geo? Tell me that?

GEORGE

You have lots of friends. Youʼll be fine.

Charley sighs.

CHARLEY

Yes, I have friends. But none of them need me. And yes I have you and if you werenʼt such a goddamn poof we could have all been happy!

George begins to smile.

Charley crosses to the coffee table, lights another cigarette, takes a long drag and exhales slowly. She sits down on the sofa and George joins her. He slips his arm around her as she attempts to wriggle away.

CHARLEY (CONTʼD)

I only have you now because you lost Jim, but Iʼll lose you again soon to someone else. Itʼs not as easy for a woman. I did everything the way that I was supposed to and all I have to keep me company is a bottle of gin.

GEORGE

Maybe you should try donuts with your gin.

CHARLEY

Screw you!
 
68.

GEORGE

Charlotte, you are dramatic. You really almost had me. A tiny tear was beginning to form in the corner of my eye. Now stop it, you know that you are still breathtakingly beautiful when you bother to get yourself up and out of bed and you stop whimpering about everything for five minutes. Move back to London! Change your life! If youʼre not happy being a woman then stop acting like one.

CHARLEY

You have all the goddamn answers donʼt you? If youʼre so smart why arenʼt YOU making something new happen in your life? (beat) Iʼm serious. Why donʼt you take that position at Stanford? Why do you keep teaching at that little school when you could have any position you want?

GEORGE

I think what Iʼve done has been worthwhile.

George is stung.

CHARLEY

Iʼm sorry, I shouldnʼt have said that. (beat) As much as I dread it, I think I might move back to London.

GEORGE

Why do you dread it?

CHARLEY

When I lived in London last I was YOUNG. I was fresh, I was everything. Coming to America was

(MORE)
 
69.

such a dream, it was the icing on the cake. Going home is defeat. None of it really worked out the way Iʼd planned.

GEORGE

Most things donʼt work out the way people plan. Youʼre living in the past. You need to start thinking about the future.

CHARLEY

Living in the past IS my future. Youʼre a man. It doesnʼt have to be yours.

They both sit silently for a moment.

CHARLEY (CONTʼD)

And youʼre a bore tonight. Canʼt we just feel sorry for ourselves a little bit longer? Mix me up another drink. Please?

George checks his watch. 10:45.

GEORGE

I	donʼt think so. I have to go. Come on. Walk me out.

He gets up and takes his jacket from the back of the sofa.

CHARLEY

But this was such fun!

GEORGE

I have to.

Charley gets up and follows him as they walk toward the entry hall.

CHARLEY

When will I see you again?

GEORGE

Arenʼt you moving to London?
 
70.

CHARLEY

Iʼll never do that! Itʼs far too much effort. Besides, I donʼt think Jim would want me to leave you here in LA all alone.

GEORGE

Donʼt worry about me Charley. Iʼm

OK. Iʼve got all the answers.

Remember?

CHARLEY

What are you doing this weekend?

GEORGE

I think I might just be very quiet.

CHARLEY

You never really did take me

seriously did you George?

George opens the door, turns and faces her.

GEORGE

I tried to Charley. Remember? A long time ago. It didnʼt quite work, did it? Good night Charley.

As they embrace, she kisses him hard. For a moment he kisses her back until her kiss turns serious and desperate.

George calmly backs up and looks into her eyes. With both hands, he firmly grips her arms and kisses her again on the mouth but this time it is a chaste good-bye kiss.

Charley behaves. She is defeated and we feel that this scene has been played out before in their relationship.

GEORGE (CONTʼD)

Sleep tight. I love you.

She resigns herself to him leaving, and stares at the back of the door as he closes it behind him.

EXT. GEORGEʼS HOUSE SANTA MONICA. NIGHT -- LATER. (1962)
 
71.

An exterior shot of the full moon through the trees.

Georgeʼs house is illuminated in the background.

INT. GEORGEʼS HOUSE - STUDY. NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS

George is sitting at his desk writing a note.

George seals the note and then picks up the gun and holds it for a moment as he places the gun gently to his head.

FLASHBACK - EXT. STARBOARD SIDE BAR. -- NIGHT (1946)

George walks up the sidewalk towards the bar. It is a lively scene outside with the bar crowd spilling out onto the sidewalk. George approaches the door and pushes himself inside.

FLASHBACK - INT. STARBOARD SIDE BAR. NIGHT (1946) CONTINUOUS

The bar is packed and filled with many men in their Naval uniforms. It is also filled with girls who have clearly dolled themselves up for the evening.

All are laughing and talking loudly. It is a wild and raucous atmosphere and filled with so much smoke that it is hard to see.

George walks in and not being able to find a spot to stand, orders a beer and a pack of cigarettes at the bar and goes outside to smoke and enjoy the cool breeze.

FLASHBACK - EXT. STARBOARD SIDE BAR. NIGHT (1946) -- CONTINUOUS

George is standing outside enjoying his cigarette as a young Naval officer walks into the bar.

George briefly locks eyes with the young man. After a few moments, the young officer returns with a beer - itʼs Jim.

JIM

Itʼs too hot in there.

GEORGE

Yes it is. Would you like a

cigarette?
 
72.

JIM

No thanks, I donʼt smoke. Is this place always this crowded?

GEORGE

Well, it is Saturday night but no itʼs usually not quite this bad. Most people just stop in here to pick someone up and then head on down the beach for the rest of the evening.

JIM

Yeah. Itʼs pretty wild out there. Iʼm surprised the cops donʼt break it up. Is it always like that?

GEORGE

Since the war ended. I think itʼs pretty great actually. Kind of pagan.

Jim puts his hand out.

JIM

Jim.

The two men shake hands.

GEORGE

George. Pleased to meet you Jim.

JIM

Iʼm supposed to meet some friends here but theyʼre nowhere to be found.

GEORGE

I just needed to get out of the house. I was just going to take a walk but the lure of a cold beer got to me.

George puts out his cigarette.

JIM

Do you live close by?
 
73.

GEORGE

Yes. In the canyon.

JIM

How long have you lived here?

GEORGE

Since 38. Where are you from?

JIM

Colorado. But I really like it

here. I think I might stay after

Iʼm discharged. Itʼs great. I love

being so close to the ocean. I

donʼt know, perhaps Iʼm just a bit

of a pagan.

Just then it begins to rain lightly. The two men look at each other and then scramble for the door to the bar as the rain starts coming down hard and fast.

FLASHBACK - INT. STARBOARD SIDE BAR. NIGHT (1946) -- CONTINUOUS

It is packed inside and George and Jim are literally pressed up against each other. There is an electricity between the two of them. It is so loud inside the bar that they have to shout.

JIM

Another beer?

GEORGE

That would be great.

Just then a beautiful BLONDE GIRL with Veronica Lake hair and a cherry red mouth, pushes between the two of them. As she does she looks up at Jim.

BLONDE GIRL

Well, hello.

JIM

Hello.
 
74.

BLONDE GIRL

Want to buy me a drink?

Jim looks past the girl directly into Georgeʼs eyes.

JIM

Iʼm afraid Iʼm taken.

BLONDE GIRL

Too bad. Too bad...

She pushes away from them back into the crowd as the two men smile at each other.

END FLASHBACK

INT. GEORGEʼS HOUSE - STUDY. NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS

George sits still for a moment, puts the gun down, jumps up and runs down the hall to the kitchen.

INT. GEORGEʼS HOUSE - KITCHEN. NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS

OUR VIEW IS FROM OUTSIDE OF THE HOUSE.

George crosses to the liquor cabinet and grabs the bottle of scotch. There is only a drop left.

George puts down the bottle, takes off his glasses and goes out the front door.

EXT. CAMPHOR TREE LANE. NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS

As George leaves his driveway he hears someone behind him.

We see clearly the outline of Kennyʼs bike in the foreground but George doesnʼt see this.

He stops and looks around. Nothing. George continues his jog down the hill.

EXT. STARBOARD SIDE BAR. NIGHT -- MINUTES LATER

George approaches the bar. He opens the door and goes in.

The place is a faded version of its 1946 incarnation.
 
75.

INT. STARBOARD SIDE BAR. NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS

The bar now sports a jukebox in the corner and a television above it. A neon Budweiser sign/clock tells us it is 11:03.

Most of the patrons sit at the long bar, staring lazily at the television in a cow daze.

George heads to the bar and calls out to PATRICK the bartender.

GEORGE

Patrick, could I have a bottle of scotch and a pack of Lucky Strikes to go please?

As he says this he notices a young man who walks into the bar.

A slow steady smile crosses Georgeʼs face - itʼs Kenny.

George looks to the bartender.

GEORGE (CONTʼD)

Patrick. Cancel that.

He holds up two fingers and points to his regular booth.

Patrick nods.

George walks over to the booth.

Kenny slips onto the bench across from George. Kenny is slightly out of breath.

GEORGE (CONTʼD)

Well, hello Mr. Potter.

KENNY

Hello, sir.

The bartender places their drinks in front of them.

KENNY (CONTʼD)

What are we drinking?
 

76.

GEORGE

Scotch.

KENNY

OK.

They each take a sip.

GEORGE

I come here all the time. I live around the corner, but then you know that.

KENNY

On Camphor Tree Lane.

They smile at each other.

George reaches into his pants pocket, pulls out his pencil sharpener, and places it on the table with a smile.

KENNY (CONTʼD)

Youʼre still carrying that around.

GEORGE

One must always appreciate lifeʼs little gifts.

Kenny and George smile at each other.

GEORGE (CONTʼD)

So what are you doing here?

KENNY

Just out for a ride on my bike.

GEORGE

Is that all?

KENNY

I donʼt know.

GEORGE

Were you looking for me?
 
77.

KENNY

Maybe. I donʼt know. I feel like my headʼs stopped up with stuff, with crap.

GEORGE

Stuff like what?

KENNY

Like, the stuff you were talking about today in class.

GEORGE

That is definitely not important.

KENNY

No, it is important. Your class is great. But somehow we always seem to get stuck talking about the past. The past just doesnʼt matter to me.

GEORGE
And the present?

KENNY

I canʼt wait for the present to be over. Itʼs a total drag. Well, tonightʼs the exception...

George bursts into laughter.

KENNY (CONTʼD)
What?

GEORGE
Tonight - yes! The present - no!
Letʼs drink to tonight!

They clink glasses.

KENNY
Tonight!

They both take a sip.
 
78.

GEORGE

So if the past doesnʼt matter and the present is a “total drag”. What about the future?

KENNY

What future? I mean Cuba might just blow us up.

GEORGE

Death is the future.

KENNY

Iʼm sorry. I donʼt mean to be

depressing.

GEORGE

Itʼs not depressing, itʼs true. I mean, itʼs not necessarily your immediate future, but itʼs what we all share. Death is the future.

KENNY

Youʼre right I guess.

GEORGE

If one is not enjoying oneʼs present there isnʼt a great deal to suggest that the future should be any better.

KENNY

Yeah, Iʼve thought that before. But the thing is, you just never know. Look at tonight.

George looks intently at Kenny.

KENNY (CONTʼD)

Actually I feel really alone most

of the time.

GEORGE

You do?
 
79.

KENNY

Yeah. Iʼve always felt this way. I mean weʼre born alone, we die alone. And while weʼre here we are absolutely, completely sealed in our own bodies. Really weird. Kinda freaks me out to think about it. We can only experience the outside world through our own slanted perception of it. Who knows what youʼre really like. I just see what I think youʼre like.

GEORGE

Iʼm exactly what I seem to be, if you look closely. You know the only thing that has made the whole thing worthwhile has been those few times that I was able to truly connect with another person.

KENNY

I had a hunch about you, sir.

GEORGE

You did?

KENNY

Yes, sir. I had a hunch you might be a real romantic.

George smiles.

KENNY (CONTʼD)

You know, everyone keeps telling you that when youʼre older, that youʼll have all this experience - like itʼs some great thing.

GEORGE

Thatʼs a load of shit. I think Iʼve actually just gotten sillier and sillier.

KENNY

Really?
 
80.

GEORGE

Absolutely.

KENNY

So all your experience is useless?

GEORGE

No, I wouldnʼt say that. As our friend Mr. Huxley says: “Experience is not what happens to a man; it is what a man does with what happens to him.”

Kenny looks at George and then blurts out...

KENNY

Letʼs go swimming.

GEORGE

OK.

Kenny bursts into laughter. George is confused but grins anyway.

GEORGE (CONTʼD)

What?

KENNY

It was a test. I thought you were bluffing about being silly, so I said to myself, Iʼll suggest doing something completely outrageous and if he resists, if he even hesitates - then I know heʼs full of shit.

GEORGE

Well, I wasnʼt. Were you?

KENNY

Hell no!

They both jump up. George throws a few bills on the table and follows Kenny out of the bar.

EXT. STARBOARD SIDE BAR. NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS
 
81.

They break into a run as Kenny sprints across the highway without looking either way. George struggles to keep up.

EXT. SANTA MONICA STATE BEACH. NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS

As George runs across the highway - Kenny vaults over the railing and disappears.

George clambers over the guard rail and looks down at Kenny, the street lights shining on his grinning face.

KENNY

Come on sir. Iʼll help you down.

George drops to the sand.

KENNY (CONTʼD)

Letʼs go.

Kenny turns and runs, whooping and pulling off his clothes.

George follows. As he watches Kenny undress he hesitates momentarily and then begins to unbutton his shirt.

EXT. SURF LINE. NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS

A naked Kenny runs toward the surf and fearlessly dives into the waves.

Seeing Kenny, George toughens up. He slips off his pants, runs after Kenny and dives in.

A wave splashes over George and he stumbles. He finds his balance and continues out.

George makes his way out further, still laughing, as Kenny continues to plunge in and out of the waves.

Emboldened by Kennyʼs enthusiasm, George wades out further, his arms outstretched.

EXT. SANTA MONICA STATE BEACH. NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS

A naked George is way out and almost out of his depth as a towering wave pulls the surf away from him. George tries to brace himself against the giant wave but instead he is
 
82.

knocked flat and suddenly pulled underwater. He does not resurface. Kenny dives under water to look for George.

EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT --CONTINUOUS

George gasps for air as Kenny pulls him to the surface and drags him toward the beach.

KENNY

Thatʼs enough for now sir.

GEORGE

Iʼm fine.

KENNY

Well Iʼm not. Iʼm cold. Come on.

EXT. SANTA MONICA STATE BEACH - NIGHT --CONTINUOUS

Kenny gets George to their clothes and starts toweling himself off.

KENNY

Can we go back to your place sir?

GEORGE

Of course. Where else?

George begins dressing.

KENNY

Where else.

Kenny smiles and grabs the rest of his clothes, heading back toward the highway still naked.

GEORGE

Are you out of your mind?

KENNY

Whatʼs the matter?

GEORGE

You canʼt walk home like that!

George catches up with Kenny.
 
83.

KENNY

Weʼre invisible, donʼt you know that?

George stops dead in his tracks with this line from Kenny.

George is very cold, but Kenny seems in his element. He puts his arm around Georgeʼs shoulders.

KENNY (CONTʼD)

You know sir, they ought not to let you out on your own. Youʼre liable to get into real trouble.

GEORGE

Oh, I excel at it.

Kenny looks at George who has a small cut over his left eye.

KENNY

Your forehead is bleeding.

George reaches up and touches his brow. He looks at his hand and sees the blood on his fingers.

INT. GEORGEʼS HOUSE - LIVING ROOM. NIGHT -- LATER

They enter the house. Kenny is full of energy and George has sobered up a little from the walk back.

GEORGE

The bathroom is down the hall if you would like to take a shower.

KENNY

Arenʼt you taking a shower too, sir?

GEORGE

Iʼm fine. Iʼm English. We like to be cold and wet.

KENNY

First, I think that we need to take care of that cut sir. Do you have any band-aids?
 
84.

INT. GEORGEʼS HOUSE - BEDROOM. NIGHT -- MOMENTS LATER

Kenny and George walk into the bedroom.

Kenny looks at the sleeping bag.

KENNY

Going camping sir?

GEORGE

Really, Iʼm fine.

KENNY

Stay there. Iʼll be right back.

George sits down on the sleeping bag.

INT. GEORGEʼS HOUSE - BATHROOM. NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS

Kenny walks into the bathroom. He opens the drawer next to the sink and pulls out a cotton ball and a bottle of alcohol. He fi nds a tin of band-aids. As he lifts it up, something catches his eye. It is the nude photograph of Jim, taken in the desert.

Kenny stares at the picture a moment, looks towards the bedroom, and then quickly puts it back in the drawer.

INT. GEORGEʼS HOUSE - BEDROOM. NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS

Kenny returns to the bedroom where George is lying flat on the bed with his feet on the ground.

KENNY

Sit up.

George obeys much to his surprise, as Kenny seems suddenly in control.

KENNY (CONTʼD)

Tilt your head back.

Kenny gently cleans Georgeʼs forehead with a cotton ball soaked in alcohol. George winces slightly but his eyes are locked on his new friend. Kenny puts a band-aid across the
 
85.

cut over Georgeʼs brow and gently brushes his wet hair back with his fingers.

KENNY (CONTʼD)

Well sir, Iʼm afraid this time you donʼt have the excuse of mescaline to explain your bandage.

GEORGE

I think that we need to get you out of those wet clothes.

KENNY

Yes sir.

Kenny stands up and moves to the corner next to a chair. He kicks off his shoes and undresses very slowly. He carefully lays his clothes on the chair. Standing nude, Kenny turns towards George. He looks shy and nervous. George, who still sits on the edge of the bed, does not take his eyes off of Kenny.

Kenny smiles sweetly at George, but George does not react.

Suddenly embarrassed, Kenny turns and walks into the bathroom. He doesnʼt close the door after him but is out of Georgeʼs sight. The shower is turned on.

George is not sure what to do. Looking towards the bathroom, he contemplates going in but instead rushes to his closet and grabs his robe.

INT. GEORGEʼS HOUSE - LIVING ROOM. NIGHT -- MINUTES LATER

George lights a fire. He turns on the Hi-Fi and adjusts the lights. Kenny comes into the room, wrapped in a grey blanket.

GEORGE

Youʼre not too cold?

KENNY

Iʼm great.

GEORGE

Would you like a drink?
 
86.

KENNY

Iʼd love a beer sir, if you have one.

GEORGE

Iʼm afraid thatʼs all we have. Two beers, coming up.

Kenny is examining an architectural model next to the drafting table as George arrives and hands him his beer.

KENNY

You live here all by yourself, sir?

GEORGE

I do now. I used to share this place with a friend. He was an architect.

KENNY

Man, guys my age dream about the kind of setup youʼve got here. I mean, what more can you want? You get to be left alone and come and go as you please.

GEORGE

And thatʼs your idea of the perfect life?

KENNY

Whatʼs the matter, sir? You donʼt believe me?

GEORGE

If youʼre so keen on living by yourself, where does Lois fit into this plan?

KENNY

Lois? Whatʼs she got to do with anything?

GEORGE

I had the impression that you and she were together.
 
87.

KENNY

Not really. I mean sheʼs kind of cool and weʼre good friends, but I think what you really want to ask me is if we sleep together.

GEORGE

And do you?

KENNY

We did. Once.

GEORGE

Why only once?

KENNY

I didnʼt say only once, I said once. Come on, the last thing I want to talk about right now is Lois.

KENNY (CONTʼD)

What time is it?

George looks at his watch. The second hand is not moving and the case is clouded over.

GEORGE

I donʼt know. My watch seems to have stopped.

George bangs his watch on the table.

GEORGE (CONTʼD)

What does it matter anyway.

KENNY

Would you like me to go?

GEORGE

No, are you kidding? Get us both another beer.

Kenny jumps up and heads to the kitchen, then looks back.
 
88.

KENNY
Is that an order sir?

GEORGE
Youʼre damn right it is!

George tries to get up, but he struggles, quite drunk now and falls back into his chair.

GEORGE (CONTʼD)
(to himself)
Pathetic.

Kenny arrives with two bottles of beer.

KENNY
Were you saying something sir?

George gives Kenny a concentrated stare.

GEORGE

Why are you here? Why did you ask the secretary in the office for my address?

KENNY

I just wanted to see you someplace other than school.

GEORGE
Why?

KENNY

Sometimes I think Iʼm crazy because I see things so differently than everyone else does. I feel like I can talk to you. To be honest sir I was also worried about you today.

GEORGE

Me? Whatʼs to be worried about? Iʼm fine.

Georgeʼs vision begins to blur as Kenny moves toward us. Our image fades to a dusky brown.

GEORGE (CONTʼD)

Iʼm fine...
 
89.

EXT. UNDERWATER

We are underwater in Georgeʼs recurring dream. From the top of our screen drifts the nude body of George, arms outstretched, sinking slowly. He moves his legs in a slight struggle as he drops further and further underwater. George begins to toss and turn violently in the water searching for air. This time he suddenly rights himself and begins pushing toward the surface of the water. He climbs higher and higher and hits the surface with a loud gasp for air.

CUT TO:

INT. GEORGEʼS HOUSE - BEDROOM. NIGHT -- LATER

George wakes up in bed with a deep gasp for air.

He looks around the room for a moment. He is still dressed in his robe. The light is on.

He looks to the chair- Kennyʼs clothes are still there.

INT. GEORGEʼS HOUSE - STUDY. NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS

George walks into the study. In the faint light we see Kenny asleep on the sofa underneath the blanket.

George stands over Kenny a minute looking at him. The light is catching on Kennyʼs thick lashes. Kenny is breathing gently. He looks angelic, and very, very, young.

Kennyʼs hands are holding onto something under the blanket. George carefully pulls the blanket back to reveal Kenny loosely gripping Georgeʼs gun.

George reaches down and gently lifts the gun out of Kennyʼs hand and pulls the blanket up over Kennyʼs chest.

As George stares down at Kenny asleep, a warm smile creeps across his face.

George crosses the room and stares at the desk top. It has been disturbed. His perfect grid of papers is out of order. He opens the desk drawer and puts the gun carefully inside.

He lifts the key out of the drawer, locks the desk and slips the key into the pocket of his robe.

INT. GEORGEʼS BEDROOM NIGHT 1962--CONTINUOUS.

George walks towards the glass door that opens to his back yard. It is a beautiful night. We can hear the sound of the surf in the distance and the sounds of the crickets and frogs.

An enormous owl almost 2 feet tall is sitting perfectly still in a branch of the large pine tree directly outside of the glass door at eye level with George but George does not see this. As he opens the door the owl suddenly spreads itʼs wings and takes flight.

As this happens our sound stops abruptly and we are left in total silence.

George freezes, gazing at the full amber colored moon, and drinking in the feeling of the fresh air.

It is clear from his face that he is a different man. He is free. The cloud has lifted.

George bats his eyes and as he does our sound snaps back.

GEORGE V.O.

A few times in my life Iʼve had moments of absolute clarity.

George walks back into the study and stands over Kenny and smiles.

GEORGE V.O. (CONTʼD) When for a few brief seconds the silence drowns out the noise and I can feel rather than think...

George goes to the desk, gathers the note to Charley and one of the other letters.

GEORGE V.O. (CONTʼD) And things seem so sharp and the world seems so fresh.
 
91.

He turns out the lamp and quietly closes the double doors to the study leaving Kenny asleep on the sofa.

INT. GEORGEʼS HOUSE - LIVING ROOM. NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS

George slips down the hall to the living room which is still illuminated by the embers of the dying fire. He throws the letters into the fireplace and watches them flare up.

He puts his hands in the pockets of his robe and lets out a deep sigh.

GEORGE V.O.

I can never make these moments last. I cling to them, but like everything they fade.

The golden light from the fire rakes across Georgeʼs face as he beams.

INT. GEORGEʼS BEDROOM NIGHT 1962 -- MOMENTS LATER.

George sits on the edge of his bed. He is ecstatic.

GEORGE V.O.

I have lived my live on these

moments.

FLASHBACK OF GEORGE AND CHARLEY DOING THE TWIST EARLIER IN THE EVENING.

CUT BACK TO:

INT. GEORGEʼS BEDROOM NIGHT 1962--CONTINUOUS.

GEORGE V.O.

They pull me back to the present

George is sitting on his bed reveling in his new found peace.

GEORGE V.O. (CONTʼD) and I realize that everything is exactly the way it was meant to be.
 
92.

George, still smiling, reaches towards his bedside table to pour himself a glass of water from the carafe. As he does this his arm goes numb - he canʼt use his hand. He tries again and then grabs onto his wrist with his other hand.

We see a look of disbelief in Georgeʼs face as there is suddenly a sharp pain in his chest.

His face is contorted with panic. He tries to cry out but can only muster a slight moan.

George attempts to stand but falls to the floor. As he does he hits the night stand violently with his body.

The clock hits the floor breaking its face.

George lies silently on the floor. He begins to lose consciousness.

There is no sound except for the sound of the clock which ticks loudly for a few beats and then abruptly stops.

QUICK CUTS OF A COMPLETELY STILL GEORGE FROM ALL SIDES AND ANGLES.

FROM THE CEILING, WE PUSH IN SLOWLY UNTIL WE ARE JUST OVER GEORGEʼS BODY. WE ARE INTIMATE WITH HIM AND HEAR HIM BREATHING.

Into our warm brown screen moves slowly an EVER CLOSER SOFT FOCUS SHOT OF JIM. Jim moves toward us as FOCUS SHARPENS and he comes in for a very gentle kiss. Jimʼs face fills our screen and then he pulls away slowly and recedes into the darkness.

We settle, in an intimate way, close to Georgeʼs face. We quite literally feel him slip away from us.

The sounds of life grow increasingly faint. George lets out a deep but relaxed sigh as his jaw slackens and his eyes begin to glaze and lose focus. George is completely motionless but he now has the faintest smile on his face.

The room is warm and dark and pleasant.
 
93.

Shot from above, Georgeʼs face fills our screen as we slowly pull back.

GEORGE V.O. (CONTʼD)

And just like that it came.

We are now high above George and his outstretched body fills our screen as our image gradually begins to desaturate and then bleaches to white as we -

CUT TO BLACK.
