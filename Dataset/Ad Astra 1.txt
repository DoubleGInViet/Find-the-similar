SUPERIMPOSE THE LEGEND: ONE HUNDRED YEARS FROM NOW.


BLACK.

We TILT DOWN to REVEAL:

THE EARTH, AS VIEWED FROM ABOVE.

We HEAR MUSIC: a CHEERFUL PIECE, incongruous with the awesome image of our planet.

CUT TO:

A NEWS REPORT on PBS.

The introductory music accompanies the logo for the Public Broadcasting System.


EXT. SKY - DAY

The bright blue sky of EARTH. Then: THE LARGEST ANTENNA WE’VE EVER SEEN. A structure stretching inconceivably high in the sky, into the outer reaches of the atmosphere--around 100,000 feet in the air. A majestic lattice of multi-wire, high-voltage tethers, studded with hardware. Towering from earth, up through and above the cloud formations. Over THIS, an UPBEAT VOICE:

REPORTER’S VOICE
If this looks to you like something out of one of your children’s comic book adventures, then you’re not alone!

SERIES OF SHOTS of the ANTENNA UNDER CONSTRUCTION over which the reporter narrates:

REPORTER’S VOICE (CONT’D) But child’s play it isn’t. This represents the beginning of a new era in celestial communications. It’s called the Gravitational Interferometer Space Antenna, or “GISA,” to those of us who can’t remember that mouthful. Its goal?

SERIES OF SHOTS of WORKERS in what look like SPACESUITS. On scaffolding, hanging from wires, etc. OVER THESE IMAGES:
 
2.


REPORTER’S VOICE (CONT'D) To search throughout the universe for intelligent life. With the recent confirmation of so many planets capable of sustaining life throughout the galaxy, GISA may finally prove, once and for all, that we are not alone.

File footage of ASTRONAUTS on SPACEWALKS.

REPORTER’S VOICE (CONT’D) The antenna will allow us to listen in, across the galaxy, through gravitational waves--seen as the ultimate means of communication through space.

Now: footage of MACHINES going this way and that, spinning a lattice of tethers. They’re almost like spiders on a web. Or HYDRAS, with CYCLOPS-LIKE BRIGHT LIGHTS in their centers.

REPORTER’S VOICE (CONT’D) Self-replicators are used for its construction. And it’s not just machines; a select few highly-trained folks from the Army Corps of Engineers will have to check every inch of the carbon fiber for flaws. It has proven one of the most demanding jobs on Earth, but these men and women are up to the task. Engineer Major Roy McBride of Las Cruces, New Mexico, says he’s not afraid of the challenge:

IMAGE OF FOUR YOUNG MEN and TWO YOUNG WOMEN, seated on a SOFA, in a nondescript office environment with an Army Corps of Engineers logo/graphic on a screen behind them.

One of them is ROY MCBRIDE.

Roy McBride: forties, handsome. His eyes are light blue, seemingly friendly, but reveal little about the man himself. He is even-tempered, but one would not call him kind; there is an icy quality to him. Still, he is not overtly cruel or petty, and to talk to him, one could never question his intentions or his integrity.

Roy speaks slowly, formally, deliberately, as though he does not want ever to repeat himself. He seems guarded, sincere, precise, competent. His face is blank but prone to the occasional awkward joke, and those jokes are made almost for self-amusement. He does not seem morose.
 
3.


In fact, he smiles all the time, and his face often lights up with little motivation. He speaks with a very slight Midwestern/Western accent. Think Neil Armstrong.

As he speaks, on the screen appears the title “Maj. Roy C.
McBride”.

ROY MCBRIDE
The Army Corps of Engineers trains us to deal with our fears. And this team here is real inspiring-- Lt. Parsegian did a repair skywalk during an episode of pulmonary edema. Now when you see something like that, you just wanna get up there and do it as good as she did. Be part of that team. So we all feed on each other in that way.

REPORTER’S VOICE
McBride is only the latest in a
long line of aerospace pioneers.
His father, noted activist and
educator H. Clifford McBride, was
part of an astronaut colony
tragically lost in space eighteen
years ago.

It is CLIFFORD MCBRIDE whom we’re LOOKING AT. Looks somewhat like Bill Clinton in that old Georgetown photo--almost like a countercultural figure, a sharp contrast with Roy’s buttoned-down appearance.

ANGLE BACK ON ROY:

ROY MCBRIDE
My Dad was...he was certainly a different kind of astronaut. He was a free-thinker. He went all the way to Neptune. It didn’t end up going the way he wanted, but he’s the reason I do what I do. I just think you can’t worry too much about the past because you don’t have control over it. So I look forward. And like I said, we’ve certainly got ourselves a helluva team here.

REPORTER’S VOICE
(cheerful again)
That team is always on the go.
(MORE)
 
4.

REPORTER’S VOICE (CONT'D) In the clouds, it’s all about the work, and one gets the sense that Roy would rather be left alone to perform his duties than talk to this reporter:

ROY MCBRIDE
What I want...is to serve, to do my job as good as I can, away from the spotlight. It’s real critical to maintain control and not to be vulnerable to outside factors.

Roy flashes that smile.

REPORTER’S VOICE
With all of the risks, do you ever contemplate the larger meaning of what it is you’re trying to accomplish? How we may be able, for example, to detect intelligent life out there, and find out what they might have to say to us?

ROY MCBRIDE
No...not really... That’s not for me to comment on--I don’t consider that sort of thing.
(the smile returns)
But...I do thank you for your
interest in the program, and we
hope your continued support leads
to our success.

ANGLE ON ROY as we:

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:


EXT. GISA TETHER STATION - DAY

The ANTENNA STRETCHES HIGH INTO THE SKY. LOOKS LIKE IT’S ALMOST DONE.


INT. GISA TETHER STATION - DAY

We are inside a crowded, cramped place, where no attention is paid to aesthetics and a lot is paid to practicality. Exposed wires and computers and electronics. A circular logo of “GISA” (The Gravitational Interferometer Space Antenna).
 
5.


Video monitors are everywhere, but so are signs of recreation: a ping-pong table, board games, cards, etc are mixed with more high-tech gaming equipment.

HANK WILLIAMS’ MUSIC is PLAYING. It’s sort of like a party atmosphere here.

CLOSE ON: MEN AND WOMEN SMILING--and looking into the CAMERA. Waving, gesticulating, clapping, egging us on. But we can’t HEAR them; we HEAR MERELY the Hank Williams and the SOUND of WHIRRING: an AIRPACK, for a spacesuit of some kind.

It is Roy’s POINT-OF-VIEW. He walks in a SPACESUIT and HELMET, in his own world. A RADIO voice breaks in, over the Hank Williams:

RADIO
(OS VOICE, RADIO FILTER)
Let’s see, we got some scores for
ya, Roy...	It was Auburn over
Georgia Tech, 35-16...	Oklahoma
17, Syracuse 9...	And San Diego
State beat Oregon, 23-20.

SMILING WOMAN
(muffled; through radio
filter)

Skywalk 714! You go, boy!

Roy waves, gives the thumbs up.	Then:


INT. POD

Aided by three men in white jumpsuits (the back of which are stamped by corporate logos for RAYTHEON), Roy is positioned inside a small compartment with a LATCH. To a jumpsuited man named SAL:

ROY MCBRIDE
I guess there won’t be too many

more of these soon, huh Sal.

SAL
Yes sir, almost done!

Sal STARTS PUNCHING SOMETHING into a NEARBY COMPUTER. Roy REACHES AROUND SAL’S EAR, PULLS a GOLF BALL from behind his EAR.

Roy taps Sal, who smiles at the quite nerdy trick, nodding-- he’s seen it before. Roy GRINS WIDELY. The STEEL DOOR SLIDES OPEN, and SAL GENUFLECTS...
 
6.


Only now do we realize that we’ve been in a STATION floating inconceivably high in the sky. Not in space, certainly earthbound, but frighteningly high up--higher than any aircraft we’ve ever been inside of.

We move outside, above a small PLATFORM.


EXT. THE BRIGHT BLUE ATMOSPHERE

We’re in the outer reaches of the atmosphere--around 100 thousand feet in the air. The ground far below is both blue, where the waters are, and tawny, where the land is. The earth’s curvature is beginning to be apparent.

The air is frigid and thin, and the environment hostile. But there is no doubt it is beautiful. We aren’t in space; we are still connected to the earth, as Roy stands at the station’s exterior.

We cannot SEE his face, which is SHIELDED by his helmet’s dark visor. We go with Roy as he steps out of the pod and walks onto--


EXT. GISA PLATFORM

Roy BEGINS TO CLIMB DOWN a SMALL LADDER. HAIR-RAISING SILENCE. Roy looks UP. The EDGE OF SPACE ABOVE. Back down:

ROY MCBRIDE (RADIO FILTER) The earth sure is beautiful today. As always...

As he MOVES, we SEE, BELOW HIM, the TETHER CORDS, NEVER-ENDING, or so it seems. And, THOUSANDS OF FEET BELOW ROY, THE EARTH. It passes below his FEET, and it’s just the most spectacular vista. The CLOUD FORMATIONS are like Van Gogh’s “Starry Night,” magnificent swirls, vibrant.

Between Roy and the ground is much air activity. About a dozen shuttles (mostly unmanned) crisscross below us, carrying tethers, busses, tether-deployment spools, and other building blocks for modular architecture. Some tethers are dozens of miles long.

SELF-REPLICATING MACHINES, looking like HYDRAS made of GRAPHENE, maneuver up and down the antenna.

With the shuttles below him, and SATELLITES high above him, Roy is sandwiched--with a lot of space--in between.
 
7.


The project is visually exciting, but for Roy, it's business as usual. We HEAR STATIC. And out of the STATIC, ROY’S RADIO FILTERED VOICE:

ROY MCBRIDE (CONT’D) Control, I have established visual with tether oh-niner-four-five. Please confirm it is offline. Over.

CONTROL (RADIO FILTER) That’s affirmative, Roy. Tether oh-niner-four-five is offline.

ROY MCBRIDE
Roger that.

Roy floats down perpendicularly alongside a several-mile-long, multi-wire structure.

Roy appears small, like an ant on a tree. We HEAR HIS BREATHING...

He rappels down, rather gracefully. Turns some kind of a wheel that allows two parts of the tether to become attached.

ROY MCBRIDE (CONT’D)
Control, I am...closing the loop

now.	Over.

A POWER SURGE has HIT THE TETHER.	Roy is STARTLED:

ROY MCBRIDE (CONT’D)
(some concern)

Control, I just experienced some unusual power surges. They appear to be quite extreme.

CONTROL (RADIO FILTER)
(alarmed, but completely
under control)

Uh, yeah Roy, we picked that up too. We--we advise aborting here, we uh, repeat--we do advise aborting.

ROY MCBRIDE
Control--I have not yet completed

my tasks--

Suddenly: along the entire length of the tether to which Roy is attached, the busses’ ACTIVATION LIGHTS come on, one by one. (The lights are how we tell the structure is active.) The HYDRA MACHINES START UP AGAIN!
 
8.


Roy can see the tether is becoming active, section after section, at breakneck speed--and he pushes himself away from it at the last second, just as it ACTIVATES.

He REBOUNDS against another, parallel (ACTIVE!) tether, IS SHOCKED, as he RICOCHETS against it--changing directions--and begins to SPIN out of control.

He SPINS SO VERY FAST...	Is he DEAD...?

But remarkably, he’s able to speak--rather calmly, given the situation.

ROY MCBRIDE (CONT’D)
(through heavy breaths)

Control--

As Roy continues to tumble, the radio in his helmet squawks away--though never in a panicked tone:

ROY MCBRIDE (CONT’D)
Obviously a serious malfunction

here--I’ve lost balance, over.

ROY CONTINUES TO SPIN, CRAZILY, MADLY. VIOLENTLY. He barely avoids hitting more tethers...

ROY MCBRIDE (CONT’D)
I’m gonna try and level out as soon as this air thickens up.
(beat)
Control?
(beat)
Control, do you read?

NO ANSWER.

Then, as he descends: ROY STRETCHES HIS ARMS and LEGS OUT.
In the DENSER AIR, HE STOPS THE SPIN.

At last, Roy straightens himself out.	Like a great skydiver.

HE PULLS THE RIPCORD...

A PARACHUTE shoots out from the back of his suit and opens with tremendous force, YANKING HIM UP and AWAY FROM US.

He RIGHTS HIMSELF and begins to float safely to the earth...

CUT TO:
 
9.


EXT. COLORADO MOUNTAINS - PLATEAU

Roy sinks to the surface. A WIDE SHOT as we SEE: SCORES of PEOPLE RUNNING TO HELP HIM...

MAN’S VOICE (PRE-LAP)
I must say, you seem to be in

remarkably good shape, Major.


INT. HOSPITAL - COLORADO SPRINGS CAMPUS - NIGHT

A ROW of HOSPITAL BEDS. Roy is sitting up, on one of them. Each seat/bed has a SCREEN NEXT TO IT. Large WINDOWS LOOK OUT INTO THE COLORADO WILDERNESS.

A pair of MED TECHS are here, doing CHECKS on Roy.

Roy sits alongside a window as they check his heart, lungs, blood pressure, temperature, etc. Roy looks out the window. Earth, dusk. Beautiful, with cloud formations. He has trouble keeping eye contact with the Medical Officers. A MAN takes ROY’S PHOTOGRAPH.

MED TECH #1 (CONT’D)
How d’you feel?

ROY MCBRIDE
Well...my left shoulder’s a little sore. It was likely hyperextended at some point during descent.

MED TECH #1 (CONT’D) Yeah, you got yanked around pretty good. But you’re in one piece.
(beat)
Sad to say, some of your fellow
engineers weren’t so fortunate.

ROY MCBRIDE
(beat)

What’s that, sir?

MED TECH #1
We lost your support crew, on the
wire--and four hundred some odd
more here on earth, too.	Been

tragic.

ROY MCBRIDE
Gee...	That’s real unfortunate.
I’m real sorry to hear that...
 
10.


MED TECH #2
Would you like the shades down,

Major?

ROY MCBRIDE
No, it’s okay.	I like to observe
the, the cloud patterns and the

mountains.

The Med Tech hears this, nods, then TYPES something into a small iPad-type device, except it unscrolls. The CAMERA TILTS UP the ELECTRONIC DOCUMENT TO SEE: “MILD AUTISM”.

As the Med Techs pack up, Med Tech #1 holds an earplug-sized item.

MED TECH #1
(hands Roy the earplug)

You might want to put this in your ear, sleep with it overnight. Just to check for any head trauma. And try to stay put, if you can.

ROY MCBRIDE
Yessir. I would like to be able to return to my work.

MED TECH #1
[If] Your head checks out, you can be cleared to go back as soon as tomorrow.

ROY MCBRIDE
Okay. I’d like that very much. Given all that’s occurred, they’re probably pretty shorthanded up there.

MED TECH #1
(stares for a beat; then)

Of course.	Try to rest.

He packs up and leaves.


INT. DORMITORY - LATER

Roy is in bed, sitting up in hospital whites. A GREEN LIGHT and a BUZZ to his left. He PUSHES A BUTTON. PROJECTED in front of him, a very advanced form of FaceTime is showing:

His mother. LEANNE MCBRIDE. Late sixties. Seems older than her age; her face is lined, her mouth slightly downturned.
 
11.


She SEES him, EXPLODING WITH EMOTION. The sound is worse than the image, for some reason:

LEANNE MCBRIDE
Roy!

TEARS FLOW FORTH from HER:

LEANNE MCBRIDE (CONT’D) Thank the Good Lord! I couldn’t lose you up there too. You’re all I’ve got...

ROY MCBRIDE
Hello, Ma.	I’m all right.	I’m
gonna go back to work soon.

LEANNE MCBRIDE
I love you--so much. I was just so sick with worry--

ROY MCBRIDE
(smiles)

There’s no reason for any kind of concern. The fuss is unnecessary.

LEANNE MCBRIDE
Oh Lord...	I know you don’t
understand--you can’t.	Maybe
someday you will...	I’m sorry
you’re alone there...

ROY MCBRIDE
It’s okay.
(beat)

I prefer it.

LEANNE MCBRIDE
I love you, Roy. You’ll always be my little one. Maybe I can see you for Thanksgiving?

ROY MCBRIDE
It’s possible.	Goodbye, Ma.

LEANNE MCBRIDE
Goodbye, darling.

He PUSHES A BUTTON and it SHUTS OFF the image...

DISSOLVE TO:
 
12.


INT. DORMITORY - LATE NIGHT

The room is DARK.	ROY is prostrate, in bed, asleep.
RESTLESS.	We HEAR his PULSE, HIS HEART...

Roy’s EYES OPEN, and he is COVERED IN SWEAT. His EYES WIDEN-- like he’s SEEING A GHOST.

AWAKE, he has a VISION.	FLASHING:

An image appears to him, and to us: The striking eyes and most of the face of a YOUNG BOY. He seems around 8 years-old, looking off-screen at something. He's smiling and blinking, in EXTREME, STEP-PRINTED, SLOW MOTION.

But the image is very UNCLEAR. It’s BLURRY, almost like a reclaimed moment from the Zapruder footage.

WIDER SHOT -- again, EXTREME SLOW MOTION. A SMALL BOY (probably the same person as the one in the previous image) runs across what might be a wet, cobble-stoned street, on a cloudy day. This time:

A GIRL, an OLDER GIRL, is JOINING HIM. The image is haunting.

The final image: striking, mainly because it's so odd. A MEDIUM SHOT of what looks like a MEDIEVAL CASTLE (!) IRON GATE, COMING DOWN, in the same EXTREME, STEP-PRINTED, SLOW MOTION as in the other image.

ROY’S BREATHING BECOMES LABORED.

CLOSE SHOT on ROY as he then looks out the window. His panic abating somewhat, he allows his head to REST back, ON THE PILLOW. His EYES DART BACK AND FORTH, looking out to the ceiling--and to the heavens...

FADE OUT.

CUT IN:


INT. HALLWAY - MORNING

A YOUNG WOMAN IN ARMY FATIGUES comes down a hallway.


INT. DORMITORY

She approaches ROY, who is dressed and sitting up. Going through a “Scientific American” on-screen magazine.
 
13.


YOUNG WOMAN IN ARMY FATIGUES Morning, Major. I’m here to take you to SPACECOM Control. For

debriefing.	Is that okay?

ROY MCBRIDE
Course, Ma’am.


INT. FORT CARSON - CONTROL CENTER - MORNING

It’s the center of the base. A big “USSPACECOM” SIGN. Roy is being escorted by the woman.

A restaurant, a souvenir stand. MUZAK plays softly. Families are here, excited. There is a TOURISM BOARD desk (A

SIGN READS, “READY TO MEET AN ALIEN? GO TO SPACE!”). A LARGE ALIEN CHARACTER, meant to appeal to children, graces the painted board: ”Andy The Alien”. Two YOUNG CHILDREN get their PHOTOS TAKEN in ill-fitting army spacesuits in front of a powder-blue backdrop.


INT. FORT CARSON - CONTROL CENTER - CORRIDOR

Roy is led down a long, winding CORRIDOR until he reaches a closed door.

YOUNG WOMAN IN ARMY FATIGUES Would you like anything to eat or drink, Major?

ROY MCBRIDE
(friendly smile)
No, thank you.	The food’s real

good in the dorm.

YOUNG WOMAN IN ARMY FATIGUES
That’s wonderful to hear. We brought in a new caterer last month and I think it’s gotten a lot better.

And a LATCH OPENS:


INT. FORT CARSON - CONTROL CENTER - USSPACECOM HEADQUARTERS

This is USSPACECOM’s covert ops headquarters. Present are FIVE of Roy’s SUPERIORS. HE SALUTES THEM, mumbles cordial “HELLOS”.
 
14.


They are: BRIGADIER GENERAL FALLON, LIEUTENANT GENERAL SHARPE, COLONEL EPINGER, and a woman, ADJUTANT GENERAL AMELIA VOGEL, who refers to a PDA-type device.

Among the others here is an older man, seated SILENTLY in the corner. Observing. His name, we will learn, is DR. MARTIN PEDROSA. More on him later.

BRIGADIER GENERAL FALLON Major, I’m Brigadier General Fallon. This is Lieutenant General Sharpe, Director of SPACECOM Special Operations. And Adjutant General Vogel.

ROY MCBRIDE
(nods; then)

Sirs.	Ma’am.

The DOOR is CLOSED BEHIND THEM. Actually, more SEALED THAN CLOSED. Fallon motions for Roy to sit, and he does as well. As the others sit around him, he’s looking at a file:

BRIGADIER GENERAL FALLON Please--sit down. Your profile’s certainly very interesting. You’ve done exceptionally well on the assessment tests. Says here-- you’ve got a near-photographic memory. Basic combat...space training, too--just exceptional, ‘cross the board.

ROY MCBRIDE
(subtly prideful)

Thank you, sir.

BRIGADIER GENERAL FALLON
(looks up from dossier)
Your pulse’s never gone above 80
during any spacewalk or skywalk?
Even on this most recent fall?

That true?

ROY MCBRIDE
It’s what we’re trained for, sir.
I can’t take any personal credit

for that.

LIEUTENANT GENERAL SHARPE You know Major, generally we look for people like you, people who won’t let emotions or fears get in the way of a task.
(MORE)
 
15.

LIEUTENANT GENERAL SHARPE (CONT'D) People who might be called “on the spectrum,” if you will. I do say that with respect.
(beat)
So you must not be surprised that

we’ve reached out to you.

ROY MCBRIDE
No, sir...I expected a debriefing
on account of the accident.
(beat)

I am surprised that Ops is handling it, but it’s certainly not a problem of any kind.

BRIGADIER GENERAL FALLON Well, we’ve traveled a long way to see you here today. And it is not a coincidence.

The full-wall VIDEO SCREEN behind Roy plays real-time images of Fort Carson. Lieutenant General Sharpe consults his PDA device. Fallon stares at Roy for a moment, then:

ADJUTANT GENERAL VOGEL
General, we’re ready.

LIEUTENANT GENERAL SHARPE
(nods; then back to Roy)
Major, this is not about your
accident--at least, not directly.
(beat)
We have...something of a highly
classified nature to show you.

On the WALL-SCREEN, A VIDEO begins to play. LOOKS LIKE OUTER SPACE. Through a TELESCOPE.

No stars or anything visible. Until, tiny on the screen, a blue dot. But not the pale blue dot of Earth. CUT TO: CLOSER SHOT. We SEE that this is the magical, mysterious blue of:

NEPTUNE.

LIEUTENANT GENERAL SHARPE (CONT’D)
That is the planet Neptune you’re looking at, obviously. Images from the Shun-Barcelli Telescope. Two days ago.

This distant planet is almost all blue, with none of the organic brown of Earth.
 
16.


It's like a shiny marble jewel, its sheen a uniform hypnotic ultramarine, except for a few darker streaks and a few white smudges of elongated clouds. Unearthly, that’s for sure.

Then, our vantage point moves, and we CUT CLOSER, longer focal length. We find our view of Neptune momentarily obscured by a faint, partial RING of dust and ice. An arc of white.

And then, an oblong object comes into view between us and Neptune.

LARISSA.

LIEUTENANT GENERAL SHARPE (CONT’D)
This is one of Neptune’s closest

moons, Larissa.

The small moon is dark against the eighth planet, exhibiting a mild, azure glow, perhaps the reflection of the color of Neptune. It’s heavily cratered.

We gradually perceive that something odd is going on:

LIEUTENANT GENERAL SHARPE (CONT’D) The degradation begins here. Followed by--

The peaceful blue diorama is suddenly invaded by a faint greenish blush that starts small as a pinprick and grows slowly larger. All is not right with Larissa. Its blue complexion is overcome by a green blemish which spreads outwards and seems to utterly transform the moon's very substance, cracking and fissuring it...

LIEUTENANT GENERAL SHARPE (CONT’D)
Catastrophic destruction.

The moon formerly known as Larissa becomes a color that alternates between dark green... and dark yellow... and black... and then...

IT EXPLODES.	IN DEAFENING SILENCE.

Rock and dust scatter in every direction, as gravity fails to hold together the transformed matter, which now glows green and yellow.

CLOSE ON ROY’S EYES. Then we linger on this unsettling scenario, until we return our focus to the unblinking blue eye that is Neptune...
 
17.


LIEUTENANT GENERAL SHARPE (CONT’D)
That event was most likely the cause of the fluctuations we experienced here, on earth. The ones that almost killed you. And caused many other disasters on the ground as well.

ROY MCBRIDE
(nods)

I’d surely like to know what caused that, sir.

THE LIGHTS COME UP.	Beat.

COLONEL EPINGER
Major, what do you know about the

Lima Project?

A TURN.	Roy FREEZES for A SLIGHTLY PERCEPTIBLE MILLISECOND:

ROY MCBRIDE
It was a research expedition to
Neptune, sir.	From twenty--I’m

sorry, twenty-one--years ago.

COLONEL EPINGER
Mmm-hmm.	Anything else?

ROY MCBRIDE
Its objective was to construct a telescope in order to search for signs of extraterrestrial life. My father was director.
(beat)
All crew were lost.

As everyone takes notes, Adjutant General Vogel slides E-
PHOTOS to ROY.	THEY ARE OF HIS FATHER, H. CLIFFORD McBRIDE:

COLONEL EPINGER
Do you remember how his departure
affected you?	It WAS a one-way

mission, was it not?

ROY MCBRIDE
It was, sir.	But the family was
not told his absence would be
permanent.	He said at the time
only that it was top national
priority to gain knowledge of

extraterrestrial life.
 
18.


COLONEL EPINGER
And how did you handle that?

ROY MCBRIDE
My, my mother has often expressed her devastation by his abandonment.
(beat)
It’s the consensus that his

departure was unforgivable.

Roy lets loose a small laugh(!). An AWKWARD BEAT. He sobers:

ROY MCBRIDE (CONT’D) Sir, if you’re trying to test my loyalty or fitness here, it’s not necessary. I assure you, I’m in no need of any kind of support in this manner. I do accept my father’s mental illness. And I acknowledge it led to the mission failure.

The others look at each other.

COLONEL EPINGER
Roy, we have something that might
come as quite a shock to you.
(beat)

We’ve intercepted secret communications sent to Neptune, we believe from Mars. They lead us to conclude that your father and others from the Project are still alive and for reasons we do not understand, appear to be conducting some extremely dangerous experiments. About which we are deeply, deeply, concerned.

ADJUTANT GENERAL VOGEL The last intercepted communication revealed discovery on Neptune of large quantities of antimatter, Major. Enough when harnessed to destroy the entire solar system.

Roy is BLOWN AWAY; that slight smile disappears. A darkness overcomes his countenance, and he turns inward.

COLONEL EPINGER
Major?
 
19.


ROY MCBRIDE
(finally; clears throat)

My father is...alive, sir?

LIEUTENANT GENERAL SHARPE We believe so. The Lima Project’s A.I. is still online, and as you know, this would indicate crew has survived. We must ensure they can do no further harm. As such, your relationship to him is potentially invaluable to us.

ROY MCBRIDE
Yes sir...

LIEUTENANT GENERAL SHARPE We’d like you to try and contact whoever is communicating with the Lima Project. We’ve determined that the signal is coming from Mars. Presumably, any message sent there would ultimately reach your father, on Neptune. We’ve tried already without success. It’s a bit of a Hail Mary...but we’d like YOU to give it a shot, find out his location and any other information you can gather.
(beat)

You’ll have to go to a secure spot on the moon, of course--for a quantum connection that can’t be hacked.

ROY MCBRIDE
Sir, in the event that contact is
made, you will then...attempt to
apprehend him and bring him to

justice?

LIEUTENANT GENERAL SHARPE That is our intention, yes. Can we count on your participation?
(beat)

Roy?

ROY MCBRIDE
Well sir, I--I’m just trying to

understand--

BRIGADIER GENERAL FALLON
Major, have you not been
LISTENING?!?
(MORE)
 
20.

BRIGADIER GENERAL FALLON (CONT'D) Your father has threatened the destruction of our entire solar system. Does that not mean

ANYTHING to you?!?

ROY MCBRIDE
Yessir.	It surely does.

Beat.

DR. PEDROSA (O.C.)
Roy, I’m Dr. Joao Pedrosa.

About to answer, Roy turns. At that moment, the old man off to the side, Dr. Pedrosa. He speaks with a much kinder tone:

DR. PEDROSA (CONT’D) I am currently Commander of SPACECOM lunar operations, at Tycho. I knew your father very well--we studied neuroscience together, at Purdue University. He was a very brilliant man--a true legend in the department. He looked at things his own way and contemplated vast concepts. So I can understand well his struggles-- because keeping sanity in the face of the infinite can be a monumental challenge.

Pedrosa gets up, approaches:

DR. PEDROSA (CONT’D) Like you, I was skeptical of his survival. But after reviewing the Neptune transmissions, I am now convinced of their authenticity. Of course under usual circumstances, you would want no part of this. But if he is truly alive, we do not dare lose him twice. Will you help us try to find him?

ANGLE ON ROY. Roy looks down again, at the screen. It’s an electronic DOSSIER. (Like an old-fashioned bank file, that opens, but its papery surface is capable of displaying digital information. Such as photos, maps, graphs, etc.) They PUSH THE FILE GENTLY TOWARD ROY. He sees his FATHER’S IMAGE in a photograph. He STARES AT IT. Roy looks back up at the men:
 
21.


ROY MCBRIDE
I will, sir.

BRIGADIER GENERAL FALLON You depart for the moon in twenty-four hours.

Adjutant General Vogel SLIPS HIM a black leather folder:

ADJUTANT GENERAL AMELIA VOGEL All non-relevant information has

been redacted. Please familiarize yourself with its contents...

The sound FADES OUT as we:

CUT TO:


INT. PREP ROOM

A small, bright room dedicated to preparing for space travel. What looks like black leather Eames chairs, cases, men and women in white pants and shirts helping astronauts get ready. Roy is being fitted with his suit. Roy slides open a kind of foldable iPad and places EARBUDS into his ear. We HEAR a RADIO VOICE:

RADIO VOICE
Slate One-Niner-Four.	Transmission
Lima Project, 7/19/15.	Voice of H.
Clifford McBride.

He is listening to an FILE. We HEAR, with RADIO FILTER:

H. CLIFFORD MCBRIDE (V.O.)
(tone: banal, scientific) We’re coming to you now from our base of operations for the Lima Project. And we’re going to send you images in a bit from our new Ocular telescope. Sponsored by our good friends at Brookhaven Solar.

OVER THIS: ROY’S POV as: men and women prepare for spaceflight, finishing their attire--as Roy LISTENS, an IMAGE of CLIFFORD MCBRIDE comes up on his screen. It is like a Skype call gone wrong; the image is high-quality, but the feed is poor, vacillating between a still frame of Clifford McBride and a sped-up image. The AUDIO is constant.

H. CLIFFORD MCBRIDE (V.O.)
Now that we believe there are microorganisms on many extrasolar planets, and so many Goldilocks planets perfect for life, we ask the question, “How soon will it be before we find intelligent life in the universe?”

ROY’S SCREEN now features IMAGES of SPACE, then NEPTUNE’S MOONS and NEPTUNE’S SURFACES as the AUDIO CONTINUES:

H. CLIFFORD MCBRIDE (CONT’D) We are so excited about this prospect. And who really knows if

we haven’t been contacted already? Who knows if our cosmic friends haven’t tried to reach us through gravitational waves, or some other method we can’t fathom? We might be cockroaches walking along a chessboard, not knowing about the great game of chess! Now--I...AM a little surprised we don’t have anything yet. [Surprised by] The silence. But--I have confidence. So...thank you, Brookhaven Solar! We have many--

The SCREEN GOES BLACK. “PORTION REDACTED.”

A MAN IN WHITE PANTS AND SHIRT then checks with Roy. Roy CLOSES the SCREEN. Referring to his suit:

MAN IN WHITE PANTS AND SHIRT How’s that, Major? Not too snug?

ROY MCBRIDE
No, it’s fine, thank you.

MAN IN WHITE PANTS AND SHIRT The pre-breathe for the moon should take about fifteen minutes.

ROY MCBRIDE
Thank you.

The Man PLACES a BREATHING APPARATUS over Roy’s mouth and nose. He moves to another passenger.

INT. GALLEY

Roy ascends the narrow scaffolding, with Pedrosa right behind. It’s oddly primitive; the way to the shuttle entrance is a fifty-foot stepladder which goes straight up to where the LUNAR SHUTTLE awaits, nose-up. Harrowing climb for most of us, but there are several people on this ladder, looking surprisingly businesslike and quotidian.

A VOICE through a LOUDSPEAKER:

LOUDSPEAKER VOICE
Please use the safety straps for
your wrists as you ascend.	You
will find them located on the rails

on either side.


INT. LUNAR SHUTTLE

Roy and Pedrosa, on the shuttle. Both men LOOK into a small SCANNER on the side, near the seats, while stepping on a DEGAUSSING PAD. Then:

VOICE
Degauss complete.

The craft seems to be part of a consortium between the Army and a Southwest Airlines-type company. A hi-tech space. Little attempt at aesthetics--most everything is there for practicality, functionality. BANAL.

A dozen or so PASSENGERS are aboard. Roy finds his seat and snaps together his restraints.

ANNOUNCEMENTS are made in English and then in Mandarin and Spanish by a MALE FLIGHT ATTENDANT.

Another FLIGHT ATTENDANT (a stout, warm woman) is giving everybody pills and whispering into certain passengers’ ears. Then, aloud, a recording VOICE:

FLIGHT VOICE
As we exit the earth’s
gravitational field, please
remember: objects will float if not

properly stored or secured.

MALE FLIGHT ATTENDANT Guys--our rear passenger attendant, Michelle Grierson, was...MARRIED TODAY, EVERYBODY! GIVE HER A HAND!
 
24.


The passengers APPLAUD as ROY strains to see this Michelle person behind him.


EXT. EARTH - HIGH ANGLE

The shuttle takes off and begins its ascent to the moon.


INT. LUNAR SHUTTLE - LATER

At the moment when gravity is gone, things begin to float-- stray pens, paper, etc. Roy of course has followed the rules, but his NEIGHBOR, of Indian nationality and middle-aged and burly, LAUGHS at his own ineptitude as his things start to float away from him.

Roy SCANS the SCREEN in the SEAT IN FRONT of HIM: MAPS of the LUNAR SURFACE. CLOSE SHOT on HIS EYES as he PROCESSES the CONTOURS OF THE MOON’S VARIOUS CRATERS and other AREAS.

The Flight Attendant hands out packages of nuts. The pilot makes an announcement:

SHUTTLE PILOT'S VOICE On the left there, many of you can catch an excellent view of Petavius on the eastern limb. The moon’s gibbous period’s waning, so you can also see the Atlas, to the north.

Roy looks out the window, SEES the landmarks. But also lights, signs of mining and human development/habitation. Tracks and angular patterns. Snapping Roy out of his observing, with an accented voice:

A VOICE
Your first time to the moon?

Roy turns around. It’s his NEIGHBOR, across the aisle. The NEIGHBOR is of INDIAN DESCENT.

ROY MCBRIDE
No, sir. I’ve been a couple times before, as a child.

INDIAN NEIGHBOR
(trying to make
conversation)
A child!	Well, it’s my first time!

(laughs awkwardly; then) There's some good new restaurants I read, though.
(MORE)
 
25.

INDIAN NEIGHBOR (CONT'D) I’m staying near Copernicus--they tell me that’s safe. How about you?

ROY MCBRIDE
My visit will be very brief.

INDIAN NEIGHBOR
Oh...	I’m in artificial
intelligence.
(with enthusiasm; wanting
to talk)

It’s a very strange thing, you know, that we have so much technology and we keep all our systems without any real awareness. I understand why, but it’s...it’s strange, no?

ROY MCBRIDE
(that gentle smile again)
Sir--I’d really love to talk to
you, but I’m afraid I’m just not

allowed.	I’m real sorry.

INDIAN NEIGHBOR
Okay.	Okay, no problem!

The Neighbor acts like he’s not offended.	But he is.

The Flight Attendant then makes her way down the aisle and guides herself via a series of hoops and webbing overhead. She checks to make sure everyone is fastened and happy. She is handing out PILLS. Roy takes a pill and sips a drink she hands him from a straw.

SHUTTLE PILOT’S VOICE
(perfunctory)

As we begin our approach: in accordance with FASA regulations, we must remind you that many areas of the moon are in a state of extreme lawlessness. The United States government does not recommend travel to certain districts--please check your nearest USSPACECOM Outpost for a complete list. Thank you and safe travels.

Roy SECURES HIMSELF as the FLIGHT ATTENDANT hands out A CUSTOMS FORM CARD to FILL OUT. She HANDS the Neighbor a STYLUS:
 
26.


FLIGHT ATTENDANT
(with a laugh)

Don’t steal my pen!

Roy LOOKS OUT THE WINDOW to SEE:

As the craft gets closer to the surface: lots of SATELLITES of varying sizes. A tether-type system that may remind us of the GISA.

MINING SITES, GREENHOUSES, SPACE JUNK, DEPOTS, and LIVING QUARTERS that look like they could be housing complexes in Boulder, Colorado. There are also HOUSES OF WORSHIP: a large CHURCH with an open roof (centered by a giant CROSS).

LIT SIGNS ANNOUNCE CHAINS WE RECOGNIZE: McDonald's, Dunkin' Donuts, etc. MAG-LEV TRAINS link together various bases and neighborhoods, at extreme velocities.


EXT. MOON - LUNAR BASE

The ship adjusts its gyropscopes and turns over (e.g. in Elon Musk's rocket designs), making a gentle landing near the army’s TYCHO BASE. The base is heavily guarded.


INT. LUNAR HANGAR

The UNDERGROUND looks almost like New York’s Penn Station, combined with an enormous parking garage and the most banal of AIRPORTS. The SHUTTLE MOVES into position, closer to an entrance.
