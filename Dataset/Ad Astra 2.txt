INT. LUNAR HANGAR - CORRIDOR

Dr. Pedrosa leads Roy through the corridor, which is, weirdly, wood-panelled. Or is it fake wood?

There are FOUR MEN and TWO WOMEN who come from the OPPOSITE DIRECTION, all talking amongst themselves. When Roy and Pedrosa walk toward them, they stop talking.

Dogs roam about, smelling them and their belongings. Pedrosa moves to talk to some of the men and women. Roy face brightens at the sight of a dog:

ROY MCBRIDE
(to the dog, warmly)
Hey!	How you doin’ there, big

fella?
 
27.


DR. PEDROSA
This is Major Roy McBride. As you know, he is here to help us.

EVERYONE
(to Roy)

Good morning, Major.

ROY MCBRIDE
(looks up from the dog)

‘Morning.

A WOMAN, LESLIE CORTEZ, fifties, steps forward. A MAN stands near, holding a PIECE OF EQUIPMENT that looks like a small EKG machine.

LESLIE CORTEZ
We’ve kept a spot for you in the dormitory. An overnight stay will be necessary.

ROY MCBRIDE
Yes, Ma’am. But I’m just here to do what I need to. I have my duties on the antenna, and they’ll probably be needing me soon.

LESLIE CORTEZ
Of course...

Cortez leads Roy with her hand as we HEAR:

MAN’S VOICE (PRE-LAP)
Uplink should be ready to go in

just a moment.


INT. LUNAR BASE - COMMUNICATIONS CENTER - LATER

Roy and the others are in what looks like a recording studio.
A glass of water before him.	Roy is seated.	Dons a headset.

TECHNICIAN ONE (CONT’D)
We’re preparing the connection now.

Outside the booth, TWO TECHNICIANS make adjustments.

Roy looks at a MONITOR before him, which gives him cues, as well as technical info regarding high-rate pulse-position modulation and error-correcting codes. A RED LIGHT goes on.

Dr. Pedrosa approaches:
 
28.


DR. PEDROSA
Whatever you say into this
microphone will be transmitted to
Mars, and then hopefully on to
Neptune.	The first step is to try
to make contact.	And then perhaps
a negotiation of some kind.

ROY MCBRIDE
Yessir.

Interrupting: the CONTROL BOOTH CHIMES IN:

TECHNICIAN ONE
Point-to-point contact with the
Mars signal is now engaged.

Through the squawk box, Major.

ROY MCBRIDE
Roger that.

DR. PEDROSA
Depress the button in order to
speak.	Remember, your father may

be listening.

ROY MCBRIDE
Sir... What--what precisely is it that you’d like me to say, in order for us to achieve optimal results?

Dr. Pedrosa takes out a PIECE OF PAPER:

DR. PEDROSA
We have assembled a text for you, one that we believe is appropriate for eliciting a response. It is written using language consistent with your own, utilizing data from your profile.

Roy takes the piece of paper. He looks it over. Weak joke, but a broad smile nonetheless:

ROY MCBRIDE
Maybe I should’ve taken acting

classes!	Okay...here goes...

Roy MOVES to DEPRESS the BUTTON. FLICKS ON THE MIC. BEGINS TO SPEAK:

ROY MCBRIDE (CONT’D)
This is Major Roy McBride, I’m
currently on Tycho Base.
(MORE)
 
29.

ROY MCBRIDE (CONT’D)
(beat)
Repeat.	This is Major Roy McBride.

I am currently on Tycho Base.

ON THE MONITOR: as he speaks, there’s a voice print analysis.

CLOSE ON ROY. Roy’s emotions are deeply buried as he READS THE PREPARED SCRIPT:

ROY MCBRIDE (CONT’D)
Dr. McBride...	It’s your son, Roy.
(beat)

Prior to this message, I believed you were dead. Our family was informed of this approximately two decades ago. We were told the stress of deep space had altered your behavior. And...as a result, US SPACECOM was forced to terminate your life support systems. However, SPACECOM now believes you have survived. And attempted contact, without revealing yourself due to fear of hacking. If this is true, I’m very much looking forward to hearing from you. I’ve always felt that it’s very important to have a true bond between father and son. We could have this bond. I do recall we would watch motion pictures together, very old ones in black and white--funny ones. And I remember your laugh even more than your face. I would like very much to reconnect with you. I will surely be able to move past any feelings of abandonment your departure presented me with. Your loving son, Roy.

BEAT.	NOTHING.	These words have unlocked something in Roy.

He flicks off the MIC, stands.	Any warmth deserts him:

ROY MCBRIDE (CONT’D) Hopefully that achieves the desired result.

The PREPARED SPEECH is LIT ON FIRE by a MAN, its ashes placed in a wastebasket.
 
30.


DR. PEDROSA
Any transmission will take
approximately 36 minutes, due to

the distance.	So we must wait.


INT. HALL - LATER

Roy is standing outside, looks out the large window. OUTSIDE: A NEARBY SIGN WITH A NEON COWBOY, PUMPING a “THUMBS UP” GESTURE--just like the famous Neon Cowboy from Las Vegas’s Fremont Ave. Pedrosa EMERGES from the Communications Center. A grim look:

DR. PEDROSA
There is no response.	Thank you
for your participation.	You will
be returned to the earth tomorrow
morning.

ROY MCBRIDE
I understand.	Thank you, sir.
Sorry I was not of more help.

The men shake hands.

DISSOLVE TO:


INT. LUNAR BASE - BARRACKS - ROY’S ROOM - LATER

The room’s almost like an economy room in a hotel. With the exception being that, out the window, hangs Earth. The CAMERA DOLLIES OVER TO SEE: a half-eaten meal on a tray.

Roy SITS, near a speaker:

ROY MCBRIDE
Confirming--shuttle 4339, moon to
earth, reservation number EH77902.

Last name, McBride.

VOICE
Reservation confirmed, McBride, Roy

C.	Number EH77902.

He hangs up.

A beat.

A TV SCREEN is seamlessly embedded into a wall. Some programming (news... sports.... something animated...).
 
31.


The programming forms a low level of constant noise. And then:

The screen CHANGES--completely BLACK.

SILENCE.

A beat.	Roy LOOKS UP.

A light, STATIC NOISE.

FADING IN is the sound of:

A MAN SINGING: “Hello, I must be going./ I cannot stay,/ I came to say/ I must be going./ I'm glad I came/ but just the same/ I must be going...”

Roy looks at the SCREEN as GROUCHO MARX APPEARS. Groucho resumes singing after Margaret Dumont’s part: "I'll stay a week or two,/ I'll stay the summer through,/ but I am telling you,/ I must be going."

BEEP!	The SCREEN GOES BLACK.	SILENCE.

THEN TEXT, on the SCREEN:

“ARE YOU COMING?”

A SERIES OF NUMBERS AT THE BOTTOM of the SCREEN.

CLOSE SHOT: ROY’S EYES. Then we SEE that the screen GOES BLACK. We HEAR:

ROY MCBRIDE (PRE-LAP) They appeared to be coordinates of some kind, sir.


INT. LUNAR BASE - CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER

Roy stands as Dr. Pedrosa and TWO MEN and LESLIE CORTEZ sit around a conference table, with looseleaf binders in front of them. MOON PHOTOGRAPHS, illuminated from behind, line the walls. Chairs all around. Coffee. Roy is reluctant as he stands at attention. HE STARES STRAIGHT AHEAD, NO EYE CONTACT. The others seem STUNNED INTO SILENCE.

ROY MCBRIDE
I believe the proper first step would be to get me to Mars, to the specified coordinates. I would of course be willing, in order to help resolve this crisis.
 
32.


LESLIE CORTEZ
We are very grateful to you for
your service, Major.	We will
analyze the information you
received.	But you may return to

Colorado now.

ROY MCBRIDE
No Ma’am, I’m sorry, but I do feel I should continue to aid the mission. My father is the individual at issue here. And under the circumstances I feel I should remain involved in order to bring him appropriately to justice.

DR. PEDROSA
(leaning forward)

A personal connection is an unknown variable and represents serious risk.

ROY MCBRIDE
Yes sir. However, the task itself inherently involves risk, especially as it appears you will not have multiple chances. And if it really IS my father who is trying to reengage, obviously I would be anxious to confront him. But I’m also considering the task itself, and not merely my personal views.

None of them answers.	Roy steps forward:

ROY MCBRIDE (CONT’D)
A situation may arise that only I
am able to respond to.
(beat)
So for this reason, I believe I
should be part of any continuing
mission.

Pedrosa can tell that Roy’s serious, DETERMINED.

ROY MCBRIDE (CONT’D)
(beat)
Sirs?	Ma’am?	Do I have your
permission to continue on in this

manner?
 
33.


ANGLE ON PEDROSA as we:

CUT TO:


INT. LUNAR BASE - MAZELIKE CORRIDOR

SECURITY MEN all SURROUND ROY, like he’s the President. A POV SHOT of ROY as he WALKS toward:

AT THE END OF THE CORRIDOR is Dr. Pedrosa.	Over this:

DR. PEDROSA (V.O.)
You will travel on a United States military craft already designated for Mars. It contains a payload of a classified but routine nature, and the crew will know of you only as a passenger--a higher-ranking officer making a visitation to the outpost. It will depart from outside standard surveillance, on the Far Side of the moon. As your participation was unanticipated, the path from our current point will take us through only recently-settled territory. We will be escorted by the United States Army’s Space Division. And I will protect you as far as I am able.


INT. MEDICAL UNIT

Roy is sitting up on a medical table. We STILL HEAR DR. PEDROSA’S VOICE. A MEDIC approaches ROY. CLOSE SHOT on an injection into ROY’S ARM.

DR. PEDROSA (V.O.) Members of the crew were selected on the basis of skill and limited social needs, and as such should be no impediment.

CUT BACK TO:


INT. CORRIDOR

Dr. Pedrosa and Roy board a MONORAIL.	As they do, we HEAR:

DR. PEDROSA (V.O.)
You will be contacted by a Colonel
Lipset once you reach Mars.
(MORE)
 
34.

DR. PEDROSA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
He will assist you as you attempt to communicate with your father. Your stress levels will be monitored at all times. If psychological failure is indicated, you will be removed from the mission. This is necessary due to your relationship with the target.

ROY MCBRIDE (V.O.)
My focus is entirely on achieving a proper resolution, sir. You need not be concerned. He was emotionally unfit, and I am not.

They stop at a GATE.


INT. LARGE HANGAR

Several LUNAR ROVERS are lined up, in the distance. They aren’t SLOW, LUMBERING THINGS, however; they are durable and tough and fast and filled with artillery.

The ROVERS WHIR and WHINE with ferocity, their engines warming up and getting ready for the trip ahead.

Roy and Pedrosa enter, joining a host of MILITARY ASTRONAUTS. One of them, a cheerful, burly man named WILLY LEVANT, late forties, pulls up an interactive 3D MAP. It shows the LUNAR TERRITORIES in incredible detail. Roy listens intently as Levant checks his clipboard.

WILLY LEVANT
Should be fine, but... We’re gonna be going through what is still technically a war zone.

(looks up, w a laugh) Here we are, meant to tame the solar system, and instead seems like we’ve just brought our chaos. This your first time?

ROY MCBRIDE
(broad smile)
No, sir.	I’ve been to many Army-

Navy games.

WILLY LEVANT
(turns dark)

This is serious business, Major. There’s no real way to know how any man’ll react in combat. It’s always a surprise.
(MORE)
 
35.

WILLY LEVANT (CONT'D)
(louder; to everyone)

--Almost a full moon. The Far Side’s gonna be real black. Fortunately we should have a clean route from here to Veda. We’ve had a little problem since September with mining pirates, looking for helium-3. But our boys did a heckuva job and swept it all up a few days ago.

Roy notices that Pedrosa is fiddling with the CRUCIFIX around his neck. Pedrosa SEES Roy looking at him.

DR. PEDROSA
You wish to join us, Roy?	For a
prayer?

ROY MCBRIDE
(quietly; without any
condescension)
No thank you, sir.	It’s been my
experience that prayer doesn’t

affect outcomes.

Pedrosa eyes Roy for a moment, nods, then starts to pray with Levant and the others as Roy prepares his suit.

DR. PEDROSA
Almighty and merciful God, who hast commissioned Thy angels to guide and protect us, command them to be our companions from our setting out until our return...


MOMENTS LATER

Roy and the others--in full SPACESUITS--board a souped-up and unenclosed LUNAR ROVING VEHICLE (LRV).


INT. LRV

This rover is CRAMPED. Pedrosa has a smaller version of his mapping COMPUTER in front of him and he is next to Levant. Levant is driving, and he makes a final consultation of the route. ON THE TOP OF THE WINDSHIELD: photos of NUDE WOMEN. Like old PLAYBOY centerfolds...

Roy is in the back seat:
 
36.


WILLY LEVANT
Arright, let’s go.	Veda, Sea of
Moscoviensis.

RADIO VOICE
You should be clear to Veda, over.

WILLY LEVANT
Autodrive engaged.


EXT. LUNAR BASE

The LRV departs, bursting forward with ferocity.

NOTE: ALL DIALOG in this sequence will have a “RADIO FILTER” effect unless otherwise noted.


INT./EXT. LRV - MOVING

Levant is looking around with hi-tech BINOCULARS. Roy is hunched back, right behind him, watching and listening:

WILLY LEVANT
Setting two-niner-oh.

The LRV traverses the lunar surface. Occasionally, the lunar DUST kicks up, obscuring our vision. The SUN is SHINING, and yet the SKY IS JET-BLACK.

Roy turns back as the base recedes into the distance. THE EARTH IS IN THE SKY! PEDROSA POINTS TO IT, then DOWN TO THE SURFACE, FOR ROY. A TALL OBELISK, made of STEEL, in the LUNAR DIRT, near the LEGS OF THE LUNAR MODULE:

DR. PEDROSA
[That is] Tranquillity Base

Monument.

ROY MCBRIDE
Surely is a magnificent sight.

SERIES OF SHOTS of LUNAR SURFACE.


EXT. THE MOON - MOMENTS LATER

A CARAVAN OF ABOUT TEN BLACK, ARMOR-PLATED rovers that we'll call the Russian name of LUNOKHODS appear on the horizon, coming toward our GUYS. The Lunokhods are driven by mysterious ASTRONAUTS in DARK BLUE SPACESUITS and HELMETS with mirrored visors.
 
37.


WILLY LEVANT
(surprised)
What the fuck is this...?
(to radio)
Alpha, what do we got here?
(to radio)
Alpha, we have what looks like between ten and twelve mining Lunokhods approaching our position.

RADIO VOICE
Roger that, Willy.	We’ll see if
they’re certified, over.

WILLY LEVANT
I’m sorry, gentlemen. They said they’d cleared this zone out. I’m sure we’ll be on our way in just a minute.

AS THEY APPROACH, LEVANT LOOKS THROUGH BINOCULARS. He DARKENS CONSIDERABLY.

WILLY LEVANT (CONT’D)
(beat)
Uh...Alpha...we may have some
problems.
(beat; more heated)

They appear to be armed. Possibly with stilettos. Backup requested.

Roy STEELS HIMSELF.	The Lunokhods are closing in on our LRV.

WILLY LEVANT (CONT’D) Alpha, they are definitely assuming hostile formation--
(to computer)
Engage manual operation.

ROY BRACES HIMSELF. Dr. Pedrosa TURNS AROUND, points to a BOX next to Roy’s FEET. Roy opens the box: WEAPONS.

GRENADES and a GUN which looks ALMOST LIKE a ROCKET LAUNCHER.

(The BLUE ASTRONAUTS in the Lunokhods brandish a weapon called a STILETTO--an electromagnet-propelled jet of liquid metal resembling a solid bar of light.)

(VISUAL NOTE: LUNAR DUST PERIODICALLY OBSCURES the VISION.)
 
38.


EXT. THE MOON - THE PROMENADE DE LUNA

The LRV turns onto a route that runs adjacent to a POWER PLANT.

The Lunokhods open fire on our LRV:

WILLY LEVANT
(to radio)
Alpha, we’re now taking fire!	WE

NEED BACKUP ASAP!


INT. LRV

Everyone bounces forward in their seats, restrained by their seatbelts.

ROY ARMS HIMSELF. Ahead of them, he SEES three possible RAMPS: one to the right, one to the center, and one to the left.

A FORK IN THE ROAD--the left side of the fork is closed off, blocked by A BARRICADE. The LRV is headed right for it.

At the last second, LEVANT jerks the rover to the right. The Lunokhod’s driver can’t react in time. SLAMS INTO THE BARRICADE. The blue astronaut is hurled from his Lunokhod, CRASHES through the windshield, flies through the air. The Lunokhod flips over and over--no air resistance, so it seems like it won’t stop...

LEVANT struggles to control the rover, which is in a major SPIN.


INT./EXT. LRV - MOVING

OUR LRV stops SPINNING.	RESTARTING, they take the left.

A BULLET/SMALL ROCKET hits the back windshield, which CRACKS slightly.

The Lunokhods are out of view now, but they’re out there. A RADIO VOICE pipes in:

RADIO VOICE
COLONEL, WE DO CONFIRM YOU’RE
FACING PIRATE ACTIVITY.	Are you

all clear now, over?

Roy is LOOKING BEHIND HIM:
 
39.


ROY MCBRIDE
There’re at least two behind us--

WILLY LEVANT
(to radio)
That’s a negative, Hawk.	They’re
still out there, behind us at 140

and 220 degrees.

Roy leans out. His jaw jutting forward just a bit, he seems anxious to do DAMAGE, a strangely VIOLENT COLDNESS coming through here. He reaches down, takes out a WEAPON.

ROY MCBRIDE
(under his breath; to no
one)

I will handle these...

He AIMS his WEAPON at the HORIZON. Then it appears. It COMES CLOSER and CLOSER! The Lunokhod is almost upon them--

HE FIRES HIS WEAPON.

An EXPLOSION.	Another Lunokhod appears on the horizon.
Gains on them.	ROY AIMS, FIRES AGAIN.	ANOTHER PUFF of DUST.

WILLY LEVANT
(surprised)

Excellent shots, Major!	Excellent!

ROY MCBRIDE
Thank you, Colonel.

A DARKNESS OVERTAKES US. It is PERMANENT NIGHT: THE FAR SIDE OF THE MOON.


EXT. THE MOON - FAR SIDE

We now reach the Far Side (i.e. the side always facing away from Earth) and are weaving amongst Chinese thermonuclear REACTORS. ENORMOUS LIGHTS SWITCH ON in front of the ROVER.

WILLY LEVANT
(into radio)
SpaceCom, we’ve just entered the
Far Side.	We need a push in 2500

clicks!	240 degrees, 58 seconds!

ROY LOOKS OVER TO PEDROSA.

ANGLE ON PEDROSA, from ROY’S POV. HE IS SLUMPED FOR A BEAT! HE SITS BACK UP...
 
40.


EXT. THE MOON - FAR SIDE - ROAD

Multiple SPACESHIPS DESCEND and DROP ORDINANCE. “Daisy cutter”-esque MOABs do their thing. It’s gruesome, spectacular, and Roy SPOTS IT looking behind him.

It’s a ferocious scene, vicious and unforgiving, made all the more bizarre by the utter LACK OF SOUND. The silence and carnage is astonishing. The EXPLOSIONS are beautiful and ferocious. The sky’s lit up for miles.

MOONBASE VEDA is just ahead--it’s built over a massive crater and is underneath a DOME.

WILLY LEVANT
We are approaching Veda now, Major.
(beat)

Godspeed to you, gentlemen.

Pedrosa salutes. Levant and the rest of the crew depart, unsentimentally, leaving behind DR. PEDROSA and TWO FACELESS ASTRONAUTS to accompany ROY.


EXT. THE FLATTENED LUNAR LANDSCAPE

Roy disembarks from the LRV, flanked by the Faceless and Pedrosa. PEDROSA and the TWO MEN BOUND DOWN THE SIDE OF THE CRATER, with Roy.

They reach the bottom, a LAUNCH PAD for the fusion-powered craft, THE CEPHEUS.


INT. VEHICLE ASSEMBLY STRUCTURE

A mammoth hangar in a covert underground silo. Greenhouses, other life-sustaining structures inside, too. The SILO is IMPREGNABLE, surrounded by a kind of HEAT MOAT which forms a giant RED CIRCLE around the PAD...

ROY MOVES to a STEEL BAR. DR. PEDROSA PUTS HIS FOREARM under a BLUE LIGHT.

The SILO OPENS.


INT. LAUNCH PAD

The spacecraft--THE CEPHEUS--is poised on the pad, glowing in the beacon lights. Dr. Pedrosa REMOVES HIS HELMET and GLOVES. Roy does the same.
 
41.


We PULL BACK to reveal the massive nature of the spacecraft/rocket. A WOMAN, SERGEANT ROMANO, approaches:

SERGEANT ROMANO
Major, are you all right?	We’d
been told an officer would be
joining us, and we heard about your

trouble getting here--

ROY MCBRIDE
Yes, Ma’am. The chaos is real infuriating, no doubt. But we were able to engage them on their terms.

Pedrosa INTERRUPTS Roy, pulling him aside.	Something is
WRONG; he’s sweaty, white as a sheet.	Sotto:

DR. PEDROSA
Roy--please, take it--

He hands Roy a thin silver card. Roy looks at him, bewildered:

DR. PEDROSA (CONT’D)
(sotto)

It is the redacted section of your father’s profile. The password is “daisywheel”. Examine it only when you are off the grid. The hard drive will protect you from any viral interference.

Roy SPOTS BLOOD, CASCADING DOWN Dr. Pedrosa’s HAND. Looks around for help--

DR. PEDROSA (CONT’D)
Roy.

Roy spins back around.	Pedrosa grabs him, SMEARING BLOOD on
ROY’S SLEEVE:

DR. PEDROSA (CONT’D) SPACECOM does not trust you. Try to remain as alert as possible; do not allow them to cloud your perception. And you will be required at times to be less than completely honest--but you must, to preserve the mission and the broader truth.
(beat)
I have faith in you.
 
42.


ROY MCBRIDE
(ferociously; to others)

MEDIC!

PEDROSA CRUMPLES TO THE GROUND. MEDICS COLLAPSE on him as ROY BACKS AWAY. Roy is SURROUNDED by ARMY, among them SERGEANT ROMANO. They pull him away from the dying Pedrosa.

Roy holds the CARD in his hand, POCKETS IT.


INT. SILO ELEVATOR

The doors open, Roy exits.	OVER THIS, we HEAR:

A WOMAN’S VOICE (PRE-LAP)
Major McBride?


INT. SUIT ROOM

Sergeant Romano hands a spacesuit to Roy:

SERGEANT ROMANO
Your vitals are all here, on your sleeve. Standard. Pulse, oxygen, CO2, blood pressure, and so forth.
(beat)
This is your Mission Commander,
Captain Lawrence Blunt.
(to Blunt)
Captain Blunt, this is Major Roy
McBride, he’ll be hitching a ride
to Mars on the jump seat.

Nearby, three men are donning their suits and going through their EXHAUSTIVE CHECKLISTS. They eye Roy with varying degrees of trepidation.

Focus on LAWRENCE BLUNT--early 40s, dark wavy hair, dark eyes, powerful physical presence.

CAPTAIN LAWRENCE BLUNT
Right-o.	Welcome aboard.

Blunt shakes Roy’s hand.

CAPTAIN LAWRENCE BLUNT (CONT’D)
Sounds like you went through some

tough territory to get here, Major.

ROY MCBRIDE
We surely did.	Significant force
proved necessary.
 
43.


Blunt nods.	He looks through a clipboard, then:

CAPTAIN LAWRENCE BLUNT
You’re certified, I’m guessing.

ROY MCBRIDE
Yes.	In EVA and spacecraft
mechanics.

ROY NOTICES PEDROSA’S BLOOD ALL OVER HIS SUIT.

CAPTAIN LAWRENCE BLUNT
Terrific...	This’s First
Lieutenant Scobee--our Mission

Specialist.

He refers to DONALD SCOBEE--late thirties, brown hair in a comb-over. He’s in excellent physical condition. Looks like old Nixon aide John Dean. He stares at Roy with his piercing eyes as he extends a hand.

ROY MCBRIDE
How do you do.

A handshake.	Scobee is COURTEOUS but tough as NAILS.

DONALD SCOBEE
Major.

And FRANKLIN YOSHIDA. Mid-forties. Totally remote, taciturn, a man of science. Barely makes eye contact with Roy.


CAPTAIN LAWRENCE BLUNT Frank Yoshida’s our Medic. And Lt. Alan Tanner is on for navigation and payload.

Finally, ALAN TANNER. Early-30s. A firm handshake and muttered greeting. Roy responds:

ROY MCBRIDE
Good to meet all you.

Roy tries to turn his forearm to hide PEDROSA’S BLOOD.

A young CADET walks in with food. Blunt looks down at an illuminated SOLAR SYSTEM MAP.

ROY MCBRIDE (CONT’D)
I am headed to Helios South, on

Mars.
 
44.


CAPTAIN LAWRENCE BLUNT That’s pretty close to where we’re headed. We’ve got a payload for the North division, but you can shuttle South once we’re there.

ROY MCBRIDE
Will do.	Grateful for the ride.

CAPTAIN LAWRENCE BLUNT
(re: food plate)

Well all right then... Make yourself comfortable. Looks like there’s some ginger beer and farmed salmon for final meal...

Roy turns to Sergeant Romano.	Sotto:

ROY MCBRIDE
Sergeant--do we know the condition

of Dr. Pedrosa?

SERGEANT ROMANO
Yes.	Unfortunately, he passed,
Major.

Roy nods, then turns, looks through GLASS at the ROCKET THAT will TAKE HIM TO THE STARS... THE CEPHEUS... Here, as everywhere, ARMED MEN and WOMEN abound. Looks down at his hand: CLUTCHING THAT DOSSIER CARD.


EXT. LAUNCH PAD

Roy, in his SPACESUIT, walks with the others holding their airpacks into the top of the rocket.


INT. THE CEPHEUS - COCKPIT

The cockpit is aglow with instruments and screens. Roy moves past Blunt and Scobee as they are ensconced to perform final preparations and checks.

Roy STRAPS IN.

CAPTAIN LAWRENCE BLUNT
(into the radio)

Checklists complete. We are ready when you are, SpaceCom. Destination Helios Station North, Mars. Over.
 
45.


SPACECOM (RADIO FILTER) (V.O.) Affirmative, Captain. T-Minus 15 seconds. Ready to go.

SpaceCom commences COUNTDOWN.

ENGINES ROAR to life.	The ROCKET SHUDDERS from the force.

DONALD SCOBEE (V.O.)
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six...
ignition sequence begin.	We have

main engine start.


INT./EXT. THE CEPHEUS

The LIFTOFF TEAM scrambles to get away. The Cepheus, barely held to the gantry, is ready to go.


EXT. THE MOON

A great fire alights beneath The Cepheus.

DONALD SCOBEE (CONT’D)(V.O.)
Three, two, one.

The Cepheus rises, shaking off its tethers.

DONALD SCOBEE (V.O.)
We have lift off...

It explodes forward, hurtling around the Far Side.


INT. THE CEPHEUS - SEDATION AREA

Roy fights the G's.

SPACECOM (RADIO FILTER) (V.O.)
Cepheus, you are a go at throttle

up.	Stand by for separation.


EXT. THE MOON - CEPHEUS

The Cepheus fires its BOOSTERS and explodes forward, hurtling around the Far Side with increasing velocity. DARKNESS returns to the launch pad.
 
46.


INT. THE CEPHEUS

The group settles in just a bit. The distant sounds of the ENGINE are a soothing, rhythmic lullaby.

DONALD SCOBEE
SpaceCom, we are commencing CTP

ingestion.

Everyone TAKES A PILL which comes ejected from the console-- EXCEPT FOR ROY, who PALMS THE PILL and SLIPS it into his pocket.


INT. THE CEPHEUS - COCKPIT - LATER

Roy looks at his fellow travelers, all engaged in checklist tasks, other mundane activities:

DONALD SCOBEE
Pilot report A one-niner, Mars

trajectory... The burn was on time. The residuals before nulling--minus 0.1...

ROY MCBRIDE
Captain, I think my suit’s suffered an oxygen leak. It’s going to require an epoxy patch.

LAWRENCE BLUNT
Happy to assist, sir.

ROY MCBRIDE
That won’t be necessary, Captain.

Thank you.	I’ve got it.

As Roy gets up, we SEE, to his RIGHT: “CAUTION: MANUAL BOOSTER CONTROL”.


INT. CARGO AREA

Roy floats in to a SECLUDED PART of the ship. He pulls out what Pedrosa gave him. The DOSSIER/AMULET, a thin, silver card. He inserts it into a slot of a small computer that is in his sleeve. Inserts an earbud.

LASERS and OPTICS read his irises. SCREENS on his helmet inside display his biorhythms.

ROY MCBRIDE
Password DAISYWHEEL.	Slate 23.
 
47.


The password and bioscan activate the ELECTRONIC DOSSIER. The dossier opens up on a screen before him--in what looks like MID-AIR.

ON SCREEN: “LIMA TRANSMISSION INTERCEPT: 12/14/16. UNTELEVISED CANADIAN BROADCASTING CHANNEL INTERVIEW: H. CLIFFORD MCBRIDE”


INT. FIAT LUX - OCULUS BASE

PROFESSOR H. CLIFFORD MCBRIDE, looking into the camera. Unlike videos from today’s astronauts, these are HD, fluid images.

H. CLIFFORD MCBRIDE
Hello CBC...Toronto...

H. Clifford McBride is on a space station, but exactly where is unclear. He looks haggard and unkempt. UNHINGED.

H. CLIFFORD MCBRIDE (CONT’D) I’d like to use this opportunity to reach out directly. To my son. If you could get this to him...please...
(beat)

Roy... Solitude has increased my perception... I look so far into the universe here, and I see how cruel it is in its indifference...
So many planets potentially suitable for life, yet as of now we hear and see nothing... I’ve come to worry that our own long-term survival is in doubt. My death is not something I fear. But--the extinction of ALL ideas, of all human expression--that is the true terror. Our consciousness must extend into the future, past any force that renders us extinct. We must commit ourselves to this goal...
(beat)
And so I, I...	If you see this--
we’re, we’re real far away.	And
some people haven’t been able to
keep their composure...
(looks down, avoiding)

It’s been very difficult...
 
48.


ANGLE ON ROY. His FACE registers that this is his father, addressing him directly--and his father doesn’t look good. Roy looks down, at his SLEEVE. His VITALS. Over this:

H. CLIFFORD MCBRIDE (CONT’D) I’m sure you will have a lot of questions about the choices I’ve had to make. But... Perhaps
someday you’ll understand.	I do
miss you.	I’m sure you miss me,
too.

ROY’S PULSE STARTS CLIMBING... So he has to stop watching before the computer redflags his bioactivity...

INT. CEPHEUS - CARGO AREA

Roy takes the small stick given to him by Pedrosa and puts it in an airlock, adding the PILL they gave him to take. Releases the lever and sends the items into space...lost forever...

A VOICE, through radio earpiece, from another part of
Cepheus:

A	VOICE
Major!  MAJOR!

Roy turns, moves to


INT. ANOTHER SECTION OF CEPHEUS

SCOBEE and YOSHIDA seem to be in some kind of quiet panic. SILENTLY attending to the equipment around them. Then Yoshida comes to ROY/US (the camera is NOW SUBJECTIVE) as ROY settles back into the main area of the craft. Yoshida turns to Roy, with urgency:

FRANKLIN YOSHIDA
Major--we’re receiving a “mayday”
from a craft that’s in our zone.
Per regulation, it may require you
to accompany Captain Blunt on an

EVA.

ROY MCBRIDE
No--we can’t stop.
 
49.


FRANKLIN YOSHIDA
(surprised)

Major?

ROY MCBRIDE
We need to reach Mars.

FRANKLIN YOSHIDA
(smiles, an uncomfortable
laugh)

Major, this is protocol. We have a mayday--

ROY MCBRIDE
We can’t stop!

Roy moves past Yoshida into:


INT. THE CEPHEUS - CONTROL ROOM

Roy enters the CONTROL ROOM, sees that the other men have put on their helmets.

The ELECTRONIC BEEPING alert plays, and DATA flashes across the main MONITORS on the bridge. Lawrence Blunt to the radio, with RADIO FILTER:

LAWRENCE BLUNT
Ninety-seven hundred kilometers

away, on the proximity alert.

ROY LOOKS OVER THEIR SHOULDERS TO SEE: on a panel screen: the image of THE VESTA IX. A small, rotating station orbiting of “Earth’s second satellite,” the asteroid called TORO. Roy is agitated:

ROY MCBRIDE
The Helios Station is the
destination, Captain--why are you

stopping?

LAWRENCE BLUNT
We have a mayday, major--this is
standard--
(INTO COMMS)

Vesta Nine, this is Cepheus Seven, United States Armed Forces Space Division. Do you read, over?

Roy looks impatient, unsure how to press the case:
 
50.


ROY MCBRIDE
Other craft will be in the

vicinity.	We have our destination.

LAWRENCE BLUNT
(confused)

Major, with respect, we’re obligated to stop. As you are merely a passenger, I’m not sure I comprehend your position.

Unable to reveal anything, Roy turns away as Tanner looks through flight information:

ALAN TANNER
The craft is registered as Norwegian, the Vesta Nine, orbiting asteroid Toro. Registered for biomedical research.

On another screen: A scan of the Vesta IX appears. And on another SCREEN, ship schematics.

LAWRENCE BLUNT
(INTO COMMS)

Vesta Nine, do you read, over?

Still nothing. Roy looks at a screen for information. Eyes the SCHEMATICS for the VESTA NINE.

LAWRENCE BLUNT (V.O.) (CONT’D) Vesta Nine, according to the Outer Space Treaty we are responding to your distress call.
(beat)

Do you read?

ROY OVERHEARS:

ALAN TANNER
I just accessed their log.	Last
transmission was Sept. 17, 13:37

PM.

LAWRENCE BLUNT
(to Command)
Command, I’m going EVA.	Possible
forced entry required.
(to Roy)

You’re the only non-essential member of this craft. As you know, protocol is for you to come along.
(beat)

Will this be a problem?
 
51.


Roy thinks for a moment, then, with thinly-veiled anger, he starts to suit up.


INT. THE CEPHEUS - EQUIPMENT SECTION

Roy and Blunt strap on equipment and make final suit augmentations for their EVA. Roy SEES Blunt is ARMING A WEAPON, a GUNLIKE object.

LAWRENCE BLUNT
(stares at Roy for an
uncomfortable moment;
then:)
I’d advise you to arm yourself as
well.	You’re no longer in a
predictable environment.

ROY MCBRIDE
(curt)

I’m aware of that.

Frustrated, Roy turns, looks through GLASS to SEE: the Vesta IX, about the size of the Cepheus, slowly rolling in place. We hear Donald Scobee from the cockpit...

DONALD SCOBEE (RADIO FILTER) (V.O.)
Heading three-three-four. Cannot confirm live contact. Range three-zero-seven-zero meters and closing.
(beat)
Reactor is still hot.
(beat)
Optimum approach angle, thirteen
degrees.	Coming around to three-

three-four.

Blunt leads Roy towards the hatch...


INT. THE CEPHEUS - AIRLOCK

Roy and Blunt stand before the airlock doors... which open into space.

Out they go...


EXT. THE CEPHEUS

A few glittering LIGHTS distinguish the Cepheus from absolute darkness.

Roy and Blunt jet towards the Vesta IX.
 
52.


EXT. SPACE

They venture away from the Cepheus and frighteningly into deep space. The Vesta is still distressingly far...

And yet, the Vesta gets closer...

And closer...


EXT. VESTA IX

And then they are upon it! Roy reaches the airlock first. He PUNCHES BUTTONS on the DOORFRAME, to no avail. STATIC NOISE. Blunt motions to Roy, who uses a GATLING GUN to blow open the airlock. In SILENCE.


INT. VESTA IX - AIRLOCK

Roy and Blunt enter the craft, pulse weapons at the ready.
No one’s in sight.

DONALD SCOBEE (V.O.)
Gentlemen, one of you is required

to find the flight recorder box.

Blunt points to Roy, and he and Roy move in different directions...


INT. VESTA IX - DECK

Roy floats through the craft--it’s vacant, jammed with idle instruments, empty console chairs. It’s quiet, except for an electrical HUM. We HEAR:

CAPTAIN LAWRENCE BLUNT (V.O.)
Vesta, this is Cepheus, responding
to your mayday signal...	Do you

read...?

The ZERO GRAVITY renders a lot of things floating: PENCILS, NOTEBOOKS, EQUIPMENT, LIT FLASHLIGHTS. They spin in the craft.


INT. VESTA IX - LAB

Roy floats deeper into the craft. It’s dark. Roy scans his TRACKING DEVICE from side to side. The SPINNING FLASHLIGHTS illuminate spots for brief moments. Roy grabs one as it moves.
 
53.


By the looks of the LAB EQUIPMENT, it appears the craft performs research on viruses and diseases.

Roy continues...


INT. VESTA IX - PASSAGEWAY

Roy MOVES towards an OPENING that leads to a DECK. LIGHTS are coming from that area.


INT. VESTA IX - ANOTHER DECK

Much CLUTTER here, lots of ITEMS floating around.

Roy moves silently. A SCREEN COMES ON. A bearded man, grizzly and haunted. A NORWEGIAN ASTRONAUT:

NORWEGIAN ASTRONAUT
This is a eulogy for 12 good men... Men who came to space to advance scientific understanding of the universe. But... Our supply generator has failed... We can no longer see the earth--and it is not visible from our current perspective... No more earth. And we are adrift, without purpose... With no hope in sight, we have
decided to do the only logical

thing...

Then: something weird... CRIMSON ORBS are floating here and there. There must be at least a dozen. Most are baseball-sized, some are larger, some smaller.

ROY touches one. Liquid. He removes his finger, the orb divides into smaller orbs.

Then--

Something else is FLOATING TOWARDS US... A larger MASS... ROY backs up--

AND bumps into a BODY.

A dead body.	He is startled.	Roy pushes past them.

MORE DEAD bodies ahead.

One body leaks BLOOD, which bubbles out of the man's torn suit, up, down and around, in every direction, forming the crimson orbs.
 
54.


ROY MCBRIDE
Cepheus, I have one expired
individual here, no signs of anyone
alive.	I believe I’ve viewed a

suicide video file of some kind.

DONALD SCOBEE
Copy that, Major. Uh, Major, we’ve momentarily lost contact with Captain Blunt here.

ROY MCBRIDE
Appears I have as well.	Will
attempt eye contact.


INT. VESTA IX - B-DECK

Roy is in the aft of the ship and is DOWNLOADING information from a central computer shaft. PULLS OUT a BLACK BOX from the console.

A small LIGHT on Roy’s tracker FLASHES.

ROY MCBRIDE (RADIO FILTER)
Captain?

No ANSWER.

Roy tenses, looks around.	Starts to float in that direction.

Roy moves between cramped rows of SHADOWED EQUIPMENT.

There’s MOVEMENT in front of him. He hesitates. Then, another shadowy movement...

ROY MCBRIDE (CONT’D)
Captain Blunt?

Again, no answer! Roy RAISES HIS WEAPON. MOVES FORWARD TO REVEAL:


AROUND THE CORNER:

We SEE a truly GROTESQUE SIGHT: a BABOON DEVOURING CAPTAIN BLUNT’S FACE!

It’s a big one, a Chacma, close to 100 pounds. It’s insane and hungry.

Roy jumps back, beyond startled.
 
55.


ROY’S P.O.V. -- The baboon SEES ROY, SHRIEKS (LOUDLY--but SILENT TO US because of our helmeted P.O.V.). It knocks over some equipment as it swims toward us in the gravity-free space, floating towards ROY’S jugular.

BANG! ROY KILLS THE PRIMATE WITH HIS WEAPON.

It TUMBLES AWAY, dead.

Roy comes over to help. He looks in what remains of Blunt’s eyes. The pupils are not dilating. Roy PUNCHES a BUTTON on the SIDE OF HIS HELMET. OUT OF BREATH:

ROY MCBRIDE
Cepheus, a research primate has
attacked the captain.	He’s
critically injured.	Suggest
retrieving the VDR and moving the
Captain to the Cepheus as soon as
possible.	Please advise.

DONALD SCOBEE
We confirm, this is our view as

well.	Over.
