Just then: A RUSH OF MONKEYS APPEARS, CHARGING AT ROY. HE PULLS HIMSELF BACK, through an AIRLOCK, YANKING the SMALL BLACK DATA BOX as well as BLUNT inside. Just in time, too, as the MONKEYS SLAM into the AIRLOCK DOOR. Insanity.


INT. AIRLOCK - VESTA

Roy pulls out a HELMET from a ROW of them, inside the airlock. Locking it into place on Blunt, placing carefully it over Blunt’s BLOODIED FACE.


EXT. SPACE

Roy and his cord--pulling the black box as well as an inanimate Blunt--move back to the Cepheus.


EXT. CEPHEUS

As Roy approaches, the Cepheus is SPINNING. He gets to the surface of the craft, waits until the AIRLOCK DOOR approaches.


INT. THE CEPHEUS - AIRLOCK

The airlock doors whoosh open, and Roy rockets in with the
 
56.


equipment and Blunt’s body on a tether cord. The doors close behind him. He takes off his helmet. Yoshida helps him/them through the airlock; PULLING OFF BLUNT’S HELMET, he’s horrified to see what’s become of his Commander. Yoshida begins immediately to work on Blunt. Roy is out of breath.

FRANKLIN YOSHIDA
(to Roy)

What the hell happened in there?!?

ROY MCBRIDE
It was a scientific vessel--they
lost control somehow.
(with gritted teeth)

I tried to tell the Captain... ALL of you.

FRANKLIN YOSHIDA
Tell us what?

ROY MCBRIDE
That we have a task in front of us. And that to stop would be a waste of fucking time.

Yoshida goes back to work on the unresponsive Blunt. Leaning his HEAD IN through the corrugated arch, ALAN TANNER reaches for the BLACK BOX. He pulls it toward him. Then, sotto:

ALAN TANNER
(re: Blunt)

What’s his status?

Yoshida SIMPLY SHAKES HIS HEAD.	The CAPTAIN WON’T MAKE IT.

ALAN TANNER (CONT’D)
I’ll inform Don, he’ll have to be

certified for flight.

As Tanner PULLS the black box, Roy follows him into:


INT. COMMAND MODULE - MOMENTS LATER

Tanner begins to draw on the BLACK BOX data. Scobee is going through his checklist, comparing it the BLACK BOX DATA that is coming in on the computer. Roy moves closer.

The RADIO INTERRRUPTS:

SPACECOM VOICE
Cepheus, we received your message
concerning Captain Blunt.	We have
Cpt.
(MORE)
 
57.

SPACECOM VOICE (CONT'D) Scobee’s retinal scan on file, and he is now in control of the craft. Over.

DONALD SCOBEE
This is Cpt. Scobee, SpaceCom.

Roger that.	Over.

Sotto, to Scobee, Roy grabs Scobee’s arm:

ROY MCBRIDE
Mars is our assigned destination. That is what requires our complete focus.

DONALD SCOBEE
Understood, Major.	We’re on our
way to Helios Station.
(louder; to Tanner)

Prepare boosters D-6, D-9.

ALAN TANNER
Boosters D-6 and D-9, roger that.

Roy HEARS something.	Turns back to SEE:


INT. NEAR AIRLOCK

The life is leaving Blunt. ROY can SEE the BODY, ENTOMBED inside his SPACESUIT. Yoshida finishes reading LAST RITES:

FRANKLIN YOSHIDA
...I commend you to almighty God, and entrust you to your Creator. May the angels and the saints come to meet you, as you go forth from this life. May you see your Redeemer face to face and enjoy the vision of God for ever...
(to the men)

Airlock engaged.

DONALD SCOBEE
Airlock engaged, roger that.

The AIRLOCK opens.	A WHOOOSH!


EXT. SPACE

THE CEPHEUS RELEASES BLUNT’S BODY into the VOID...
 
58.


Their fallen commander tumbles away, into the darkness. The Cepheus’ BOOSTER ROCKETS FIRE, and the CRAFT speeds away-- leaving Blunt’s body to tumble. Forever...

DISSOLVE TO:


EXT. MARS - LATER

The RED PLANET, floating in space. A space elevator with a SPINNING DOCKING STATION is tethered to the planet.

The Cepheus ARRIVES into view, its retros thrusting.


INT. CEPHEUS

The men speak:

DONALD SCOBEE
(to radio)

SpaceCom, we are approaching Mars, Helios North. Over.


EXT. OUTSIDE THE SPACE ELEVATOR

It slows to a stop as it DOCKS with THE DOCKING BAY connected to MARS.


INT. THE CEPHEUS - CONTINUOUS

As Roy, Tanner, Scobee, and Yoshida ready themselves to leave: A DOWNLOAD COMMENCES.

SPACECOM VOICE
Cepheus, this is SpaceCom. We have a secure download for passenger Roy McBride.

DONALD SCOBEE
Send it through.	Over.

The FILE DOWNLOADS.	Roy takes the chip and:


INT. SECURE CORNER

Roy downloads the chip:
 
59.


SPACECOM VOICE
An additional message was sent to
the moon’s communications center,
approximately seven hours after

your departure.

ROY FOCUSES. On a SCREEN comes: THE IMAGES OF THE MEDIEVAL CASTLE THAT ROY has OBSESSED OVER! The MUSIC is odd, a strange “easy listening” tune...

ROY MOVES CLOSE TO THE SCREEN. Then, the IMAGERY CUTS OUT, leaving a TEXT SENTENCE, white TEXT on BLACK SCREEN:

“ARE YOU COMING?”

NEW LINE of TEXT:

“06:10:00”

ANGLE ON ROY as we:

CUT TO:


INT. DOCKING AREA - CEPHEUS

Roy SHAKES the hands of Scobee and Yoshida and Tanner:

ROY MCBRIDE
My condolences for Captain Blunt,
gentlemen.	I do appreciate the
ride and wish you the best on the

rest of your journeys.

DONALD SCOBEE
Thank you, Major. Glad we could be of service...

The HATCH OPENS for ROY, and he glides through.


INT. SHUTTLE

Roy is in the shuttle to Helios South.


INT. DOCKING BAY - MOMENTS LATER

He enters the docking bay of the space station. Nobody’s here to greet him, although there are cameras and active screens. BEEEEP! ROY SPEAKS:

ROY MCBRIDE
McBride, Roy C.	Submit.
 
60.


Steps forward and puts his eye in the scanner.

WOMAN ON A SCREEN
Approved.

A moment, then a WHOOSH!	A LARGE DOOR OPENS TO:


INT. SPACE ELEVATOR

The CREW, entering in the elevator. Roy looks out, SEEING THE RED PLANET’S SURFACE APPROACHING as the thing descends.

INT. HELIOS STATION - MARS SURFACE

The ELEVATOR “lands” on MARS. The LARGE STEEL DOOR UNLOCKS AUTOMATICALLY. ROY steps out.

We don’t see any people here yet. But several SIBERIAN HUSKIES walk up and down the halls of the installation. A couple of them come up to our men and sniff around.

A weird SCREECHING sound pervades--as if something large deep inside the station needs repair...or, at the very least, WD40.

THEN: A FEW SCIENTISTS staggering down the hall, too--SINGING some unknown song badly, somewhat drunkenly. A GUY IN ROLLER-SKATES speeds past in the background.

A SEEMINGLY INSANE MARS OFFICER, a woman of fifty, charges to
Roy:

MARS OFFICER
Did you bring us seeds?!?	What
about canned produce, did you do

THAT?

ROY MCBRIDE
No. I’m sorry. I don’t have any. Sorry... Is your commanding officer--

Roy looks past her. It’s MADNESS. More passersby, more revelry... and the return of the Roller-Skater.

Next comes an unctuous officer named SERGEANT PETER BELLO (fiftysomething, strangely tan) greets our man. He may not be drunk, but it’s unclear if he has his wits about him.

SGT. BELLO
(with a slightly mad grin,
too loud at times)
(MORE)
 
61.

SGT. BELLO (CONT'D) Good afternoon! Or evening--or whatever the fuck! WELCOME TO THE VERY LAST MANNED OUTPOST IN OUR SOLAR SYSTEM! [I’m] Sergeant Bello... You comin’ from earth, or the moon??? OR WHAT?!? Wait, whose retinal scan’d I approve?

ROY MCBRIDE
I’ve been sent by SpaceCom to conduct an inspection near Vallis Marineris and I need access to the location as soon as possible. I need to see a Colonel Lipset.

SGT. BELLO
Oh, I bet he’s at Shunga Show, brother! Where we should be! Keep ourselves right in the head--and down BELOW, if you get my meaning--

ROY INTERRUPTS him.

ROY MCBRIDE
I need to talk to him.	It’s
urgent.

SGT. BELLO
Okay, cowboy...	Okay...


INT. HELIOS STATION - SHUNGA PARLOR

An enormous dark space, almost like the Whale Room in New York’s American Museum of Natural History. It’s lit only by black light.

PROJECTED ALL OVER, we SEE...several physically perfect STRIPPERS (holographic--but also totally lifelike).

ROY joins the throng of SCIENTISTS & MILITARY. EVERYONE is SMOKING POT and doing a lot of other stuff.

Roy walks through some of the strippers.

SGT. BELLO
(excitedly)

They keep us company! Don’t misunderstand me, we’re not allowed’t make ‘em sentient, course. But our scientists here’ve tampered with ‘em--given ‘em a little more personality, we’ll say!
(MORE)
 
62.

SGT. BELLO (CONT'D)
They’re still well within legal
A.I. cognition limits, I promise

you!

Roy looks around him at a couple of gorgeous (fake) women, GYRATING IN UNISON to “TALKIN’ LOUD AND SAYIN’ NOTHING”.

Roy SEES a LARGE BUFFET TABLE with PROCESSED FOOD.

The virtual HOLO WOMEN move around Roy like ghosts.

It’s James Brown night, evidently. The Godfather of Soul is actually here in person, “on stage”--a perfect, life-like hologram.

Roy's sort of pushing the Holo Women away, like swatting flies. His hand just goes through them. Roy and the rest of the crew encounter:

Sitting on a cushion, smoking a BONG and working on God-knows-what with old-fashioned pencil and paper, is astrophysicist SAMIR MALIK--bearded, thirtysomething, bespectacled, hippyish. A shit-eating grin. HIS WIFE, CHERYL, is next to him. Projected around them is a WARM SPACE, almost like a high-end LOG CABIN. STANDING NEARBY: COLONEL LIPSET, a grizzled man, about forty-five years old. Lined face, gaunt. He STARES AT ROY...

SGT. BELLO (CONT’D)
Sam, this guy’s got orders, from
SpaceCom.	Looking for a Colonel

Lipset.

Malik smiles broadly, holds out a hand to shake Roy’s. COMPLETELY STONED. His hand is robotic, a metallic gold (for no explained reason).

SAMIR MALIK
Samir Malik--I’m superintendant. With National Institute of Sciences. Cal-Tech Mafia! This’s my wife, Cheryl.

CHERYL
Pleased to meet you.

SAMIR MALIK
(with a snort)

Well, it’s a pleasure to meet anybody this far out--’specially anybody with their heads screwed on straight! END of the LINE here!
 
63.


Awkward pause, the MEN LOOK AROUND at the surroundings.
COLONEL LIPSET is still staring. Then:

SAMIR MALIK (CONT’D)
(lets out a laugh)
Gotta maintain that human

connection somehow...

The OFFICER REACHES DOWN to a METAL PLANK below his feet and FLIPS a SWITCH. OFF GOES the HOLOGRAPHIC ROOM AROUND THEM, that “HIGH-END LOG CABIN”, revealing the real space around them. Stepping forward is Colonel Lipset:

COLONEL LIPSET
Major, I’m Colonel Lipset.

ROY MCBRIDE
Sir.	YES.

As COLONEL LIPSET MOVES to shake Roy’s hand, he LEANS IN, softly into Roy’s EAR:

COLONEL LIPSET
I’ve been fully briefed.

Straightening up, and louder:

ROY MCBRIDE
Yessir.

Roy turns, HANDS LIPSET A PRINTOUT.

ROY MCBRIDE (CONT’D)
My destination is these

coordinates.

COLONEL LIPSET
(looks, then to Malik)

Dr. Malik?

MALIK LOOKS AT IT, then UP AT THEM, LIKE ROY’S NUTS. Grows DEADLY SERIOUS. Turns to his wife:

SAMIR MALIK
Honey, I’ve gotta go back to work.
(back to Roy)

Why don’t you take a ride with me.


INT. HELIOS CORRIDOR - MONORAIL

ROY, SAMIR MALIK in a SPEEDING MONORAIL. A LIT MAP IS IN FRONT OF THEM. With Malik is his right-hand, a woman named KATHRYN COLLINS. COLONEL LIPSET is with them, SILENT.
 
64.


SAMIR MALIK
The spot is in the middle of our complex of fission reactors. It’s a Westinghouse design, built--I wanna say six earth years ago?

He looks to Collins:

KATHRYN COLLINS
That’s right.

SAMIR MALIK
Right. Well, there was a meltdown in reactor three a few months after completion. Likely a result of industrial sabotage.

ROY MCBRIDE
What’s its current status?

SAMIR MALIK
Kathryn knows more than I do here.

Roy TURNS TO THE MAP IN FRONT OF THEM as it scrolls up to the northern hemisphere, then stops. Like Google Maps’ “Street View”--a remote camera has captured the exterior of a Martian REACTOR. Roy studies the location.

Collins points to the map, which shows a “skeleton” of the reactor’s innards.

KATHRYN COLLINS (CONT’D) This area was walled-off after the disaster. They poured concrete to prevent further contamination. And many of the tunnels are still filled with cooling water.

Roy is studying images of a large TELESCOPE ARRAY near the reactor in Valles Marineris.

ROY MCBRIDE
What is that, to the right?

KATHRYN COLLINS
A radio telescope. Still active. Which is why we're continuing to pump electricity, water, and oxygen through the reactor. No one’ll spend the money to build a new telescope away from the contaminated area, and it needs those things to operate.
 
65.


ROY MCBRIDE
So this whole zone is deserted now-- but it still has power, that’s what I’m to understand?

COLONEL LIPSET
That is correct, major.

Everyone falls silent.	Lipset’s interjection is odd.	Then:

KATHRYN COLLINS
SPACECOM’s using Cornell University
to do an ongoing study of the
disaster.	One of their fellows’s
named Francesca DeSanctis.	She’s

their point person.

As Roy sifts through the reactor scans:

ROY MCBRIDE
I’d like to debrief her--if that’s okay with you.

COLONEL LIPSET
We’ll get her to you.

A TENSE BEAT.	Then:

SAMIR MALIK
Anything we should know here?

COLONEL LIPSET
I’m sorry, Doctor--how do you mean?

SAMIR MALIK
(looks to Collins, then)

Well...we had a power surge, couple of weeks ago, and we had a lot of repair work on our hands.

COLONEL LIPSET
I seem to recall reading that
quakes happen here from time to

time, maybe that was the cause.

SAMIR MALIK
They do, but...
(beat; shrugs)

Look, we’ve heard rumors. About an explosion, off Neptune.
(beat)
I guess I’m wondering--should

we...evacuate?
 
66.


Colonel Lipset looks to Roy, who responds “properly”:

ROY MCBRIDE
The mission’s classified, I’m

sorry.

Malik purses his lips.	Not the most encouraging answer.

ROY MCBRIDE (CONT’D)
Please find the woman.

CUT TO:


INT. THE HELIOS - CHAPEL/LAB - CONTINUOUS

What was once solely a chapel has been converted to a lab mixed with a weird version of a 1960’s hippy ashram. Blankets, lamps, etc. A WOMAN whose back is to us.

SAMIR MALIK
Her name is Francesca DeSanctis--
she was born here.	She’s part of
the Cornell Extension program and
had been working on the Mars
geology project.	So she’s been
researching the territory for
years.

A CLOSE SHOT on FRANCESCA DESANCTIS, early forties, as she turns around to us. Lovely but also fragile. Not physically delicate, but somehow, we can tell she’s emotionally vulnerable. She is whiter than white--as if her skin has never seen sunlight. Veins are visible beneath her temples.

She looks into the camera, then STANDS UP, walks toward us as ROY ENTERS.

FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
Hello.

ROY MCBRIDE
Good evening.

FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
(wide smile)

Or morning.

ROY MCBRIDE
(gentle smile in return)
Right, yes.
(beat)
I’m from USSPACECOM, and I have

some questions for you.
 
67.


FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
All right.

ROY MCBRIDE
I ask you not to be concerned, I

just need to know what you know--

FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
(interrupting)

I’m not concerned.

ROY MCBRIDE
Okay, that’s good...	Dr. Malik
informs me that you’ve been

studying the reactors?

FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
Yes.	For about four years now, for
a SPACECOM study.	I toured the
area myself before a series of
quakes hit the area.	I was the
last to enter.
(wry smile)
I guess I’m the lucky one.
(beat)

All my records are on file, and I have adhered most strictly to all regulations. My scientific work is very important. It’s, it’s what I have.

ROY MCBRIDE
(nods; then)
You haven’t noticed anything

unusual inside the reactors?

FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
Apart from the physical activity?

ROY MCBRIDE
What do you mean?

FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
I informed SPACECOM about signs of a physical disturbance inside the reactor. Didn’t they tell you?

ROY MCBRIDE
(thrown)
No...I, I have no information on

that matter...
 
68.


FRANCESCA DESANCTIS Well, it’s my feeling that a person has been inside the core. I’ve noticed what I think are some very obvious signs.

ROY IS STUNNED.

FRANCESCA DESANCTIS (CONT’D) I can take you down there--if, if that’s where you need to go. I know the routes and I can help.

ROY MCBRIDE
(cutting her off)

Thank you. I think I have enough information for now. I’ll contact you.

CUT TO:


INT. HELIOS CONFERENCE ROOM

Roy and Colonel Lipset are huddling. Lipset looks at DATA PAPERS. In medias res:

ROY MCBRIDE
I do believe now it’s possible that my father escaped from Neptune, yes. In a craft of some sort, perhaps--something of 3-D fabrication. We’d have to find out where he’s hiding here on Mars, course.

COLONEL LIPSET
Either that, or it’s not him.

ROY MCBRIDE
Sir, with respect, there’s no one
else who had knowledge of the
things that have been sent to me.

It is him.

Lipset looks up.	A beat.	Then:

COLONEL LIPSET
No one’s been inside there for
years.	We don’t know what’s down
there.
(MORE)
 
69.

COLONEL LIPSET (CONT'D)
It could be extremely dangerous--
the radiation, the, the self-
replicators may still be active.
And you don’t know the

way--

ROY MCBRIDE
I would go with Ms. DeSanctis. She would guide me to the location and I could then initiate the contact with my father. I would set her free and convince him to surrender. You’d have continued access to my data, and you could speak with me directly through my MMU.
(beat)
This is the necessary mission, sir.
And time is critical.

Lipset begins to BURN the DATA PAPERS.

COLONEL LIPSET
We’ll have to follow you close
behind, ready to move and hopefully
obtain intel on the Lima Project’s

precise location off Neptune.

Roy LOOKS TROUBLED.	DOES NOT SPEAK UP.

COLONEL LIPSET (CONT’D)
Is this a problem for you?

ROY MCBRIDE
(beat)

No sir...

COLONEL LIPSET
Good.	Because we’re only here to
help.

ANGLE ON ROY as we:

CUT TO:


INT. HELIOS PREPARATION ROOM

Francesca is getting a SPACESUIT put on her. She’s rarely had one on before; it looks awkward, almost preposterous, on her. She’s older than Roy; she is lovely in her vulnerability. Incredibly aware and sensitive eyes--as well as a seemingly easygoing manner:
 
70.


ROY MCBRIDE
Are you uncomfortable with the

unit, Ma’am?

FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
I’ve grown up with these but I’ve

never liked them.

ROY MCBRIDE
This one’s considerably better than the earlier models. I’ve noticed increased flexibility with the newer MMUs. They have all our vitals here. And you can release all the nitrogen fuel at once, if you need to, from the pack or even from your boots, here.
(beat; senses her stress)

If you breathe normally, there’s no cause for panic.

FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
That’s what I try to do.
(smiles)
“Breathe,” I tell myself.	It
should be easy.	It probably is,

for you.

She accepts that. Roy REACHES for a SMALL ELECTRONIC FLAT SCREEN, which he unfolds:

ROY MCBRIDE
Is this map accurate?

FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
(nods; then)

Yes. But when we get there, there’s also a guide rope that we installed through the tunnels right after meltdown. It leads to the center of the core.

ROY MCBRIDE
Okay...
(beat)

And--and thank you, Ma’am. You can rest assured that this is of great importance, what you’re doing. For the Earth.

FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
(nods; then)
I’ve only been to earth once,
actually.	As a child.
(MORE)
 
71.

FRANCESCA DESANCTIS (CONT'D) I have a tissue disorder because I was born here. They said I’d die

if I tried going back, through the radiation belt. But they’re working on new medications.

Unexpectedly, she stops speaking. Looks at Roy. Her EYES WELL UP:

FRANCESCA DESANCTIS (CONT’D) I remember it very well--I remember, it was extremely beautiful.

ROY MCBRIDE
Some parts, yes.
(lets out a laugh)

Other parts...not so much.

FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
(interior)
I wish I could be there...I wish,
more than anything else...
(louder; eases)
A lot of people here get lonely.
And they break down.	The mental
hospital at Helios is always full
of patients.
(sotto; looks at the map)
It’s why I always thought the
reactor crew itself caused the
meltdown.	I think they just lost
it...

A beat.	She seems to get an idea:

FRANCESCA DESANCTIS (CONT’D)
Hey, I think I saw a news program

on you, from a few years back. I just realized, I think I know you!

ROY IS MOMENTARILY CONFUSED:

FRANCESCA DESANCTIS (CONT’D) It was--it was about the Space Antenna!

ROY MCBRIDE
Oh yes, the gravitational wave antenna. It’s almost finished now. It’s going to be an excellent project. We’ll be able to hear any intelligent life, possibly even respond.
 
72.


FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
Maybe I’ll be able to go to the

Earth and see it someday...

ROY MCBRIDE
Yes, it will be completed soon. Our team was really working toward that. All of us, back home. It’s a very worthy endeavor-- communication with other potential lifeforms.

DeSanctis looks at her suit.	Then:

ROY MCBRIDE (CONT’D)
I think you’re ready.

A BUTTON on Francesca’s SUIT is PUSHED and it COLLAPSES AROUND HER, SNUG. She looks uncomfortable--but ready. Roy SMILES at her; he’s comfortable. There’s even a level of sexual attraction, maybe. Maybe. Roy talks to his sleeve:

ROY MCBRIDE (CONT’D) Doctor, Colonel--I think we’re good to go here.

ANGLE ON ROY as he LOOKS UP. THROUGH GLASS, we SEE: SAMIR MALIK and COLONEL LIPSET looking at them.

CUT TO:


INT. UNDERGROUND STATION

A maze-like installation.	A ROVER about to depart.


INT. ROVER

In the ROVER are Roy and Francesca. With KATHRYN COLLINS driving.


EXT. MARS - SHUTTLE PORT - DAY

The ground opens up and the rover emerges onto the strikingly bright Martian terrain.


EXT. MARS - VALLES MARINERIS - LATER

The rover drives alongside one of Mars's monumental canyons, VALLES MARINERIS. It's amazing.
 
73.


INT. ROVER

A wonder to behold.	ALL DIALOG IS RADIO FILTER:

FRANCESCA DESANCTIS That is Valles Marineris, over to your right--it’s a thousand times bigger than the Grand Canyon on earth. And just about every other month an earthsick person throws himself off it.


INT./EXT. FRONT ROVER - CONTINUOUS

Francesca DeSanctis gestures to a large structure that they’re about to pass.

FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
The area we’re entering was self-
sufficient at one time, with a
greenhouse and self-replicating
units for maintenance and repair.
(to Collins)
You can take us right to that white circle, Kathryn.

KATHRYN COLLINS
Will do.

Collins pulls the rover over to the side of the road, near a WHITE STEEL CIRCLE TUBE in the dirt--about 10 feet in diameter. Roy leans forward. To Collins:

ROY MCBRIDE
I have activated GPS so you can find us. When we’re done. It reports that we have twenty-six minutes until we need to be inside.

KATHRYN COLLINS
Roger that.	We’ll be more than
happy to come pick you up on our
Mars Taxi service!
(no answer from Roy, so)

Good luck, both of you!


EXT. MARS - VALLES MARINERIS - CONTINUOUS

The rover’s doors open.	Roy steps out.

Roy and Francesca are left all alone as the Rover leaves behind a trail of dust.
 
74.


It’s silent. The landscape is mostly barren--the greenhouse, the radio telescope, and a few other structures are in the distance.

A purple DUST STORM materializes, gathers, grows, approaches.

The atmosphere is obscured.

Luckily, the atmosphere is so thin that these twisters are harmless--they just leave a RED/VIOLET HUE over Roy’s and Francesca’s spacesuit and helmet.

Francesca finds a HATCH, covered in dust and dirt. POINTS TO ROY. Roy bends down, shoves the dirt away and find a metal protuberance. After removing more dirt, he is ABLE TO LIFT UP THE HATCH.

DOWN THEY GO, INTO AN UNDERGROUND CHAMBER.


INT. UNDERGROUND CHAMBER

A CONCRETE SARCOPHAGUS. A WALL. With a CIRCULAR WHEEL, leading DOWNWARD. FRANCESCA GESTURES.

ROY TURNS THE WHEEL.	It opens, and they descend into the
DARK WATER:


INT. TUNNELS

THEY ARE NOW SWIMMING in a TUNNEL of DARKNESS. Roy and Francesca have HELMET LIGHTS which illuminate a few feet in front of them.

They PULL THEMSELVES ALONG by the GUIDE ROPE.

ROY’S SLEEVE BLINKS: “EXCESSIVE RADIATION”


INT. DEEPER INTO THE TUNNELS

They are dark.

Only a few feet in front of Roy is illuminated.

THE TWO PULL THEMSELVES ALONG THE ROPE SLOWLY and CAREFULLY.
INTO THE DARKNESS.

But then we see the movement of particulate in the air.
Something is causing dust to disperse in that DARK TUNNEL...

ROY MCBRIDE
Something appears to be moving.
 
75.


The breaths quicken.

TERROR on her face. He looks down the pipeway; he can focus on nothing else...

SOMETHING begins to appear in the darkness...

FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
I just received a text message,
imploring us not to proceed.	It
says if we do we will be

destroyed...

SLOWLY BUT SURELY we begin to make it out...

It is a creaturelike SELF-REPLICATING MACHINE.

We’ve SEEN SOMETHING LIKE IT before; they were working on the tether, in the beginning of our story. But this one is larger, somehow more unforgiving. Its HEAD is ONE HEADLIGHT; the head looks like Odilon Redon’s portrait of the CYCLOPS...

It charges at them in silence, through the dense water. It appears to be WELDING--it has TENDRILS, like a HYDRA, which it uses to push itself down the TUNNEL.

It gets CLOSER AND CLOSER!

ROY MCBRIDE
Please send it code, tell it that
we’ll proceed no further and it

need not be concerned.

She is typing into her sleeve. A TENDRIL REACHES OUT about to GRAB FRANCESCA.

AND THEN IT STOPS.	STOPS PROCEEDING.

Roy steps forward. Approaches the enormous hydra, which seems frozen and no longer threatening.

AT INCREDIBLE SPEED, he withdraws his PULSE WEAPON, FIRES AT IT. DIRECT HIT!

It moves spasmodically for a moment after it is hit--almost as if in physical pain.

ROY APPROACHES IT, CLOSE, FIRING THE PULSE WEAPON to the CENTER of the EYE of the HEAD...

THE HYDRA JERKS SPASMODICALLY AGAIN.

ROY then GRABS FRANCESCA’S ARM; REACHES OVER and PULLS on what LOOKS LIKE A RIPCORD of sorts from his MMU.
 
76.


THE MMU on ROY’S BACK RELEASES ALL THE NITROGEN in the PACK, YANKING HER and ROY with TREMENDOUS SPEED PAST THE DESTROYED HYDRA; they TUMBLE THROUGH THE WATER, BLOWING away from the HYDRA and toward relative safety.

ROY finds the CABLE, and, holding onto FRANCESCA, he uses her own MMU for power.


INT. TUNNEL AIRLOCK

The TWO ENTER:

Francesca leads him.

ROY MCBRIDE
(to radio)

Command, it appears we encountered a self-replicator of some kind, perhaps one meant to secure the structure.

COMMAND VOICE
Copy that, Major.	Is it still
active?

ROY MCBRIDE
Negative.	It has been disabled.

COMMAND VOICE
All right, proceed to the core.
You have twelve minutes until you

reach the time indicated.


INT. DIFFERENT TUNNEL

The two enter a long, BLUE-LIGHT TUNNEL.	After a few steps,
Roy stops.	Something’s wrong:

FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
Major?	Are you all right?

A beat.

ROY MCBRIDE
My pulse is getting a little more

rapid here.

FRANCESCA DESANCTIS Mine is as well. We didn’t expect to encounter that.
(MORE)
 
77.

FRANCESCA DESANCTIS (CONT'D)
The unit was perhaps agitated by
the recent quake--disoriented by

having to operate alone.

ROY MCBRIDE
No...Ma’am--that’s, that’s not it.
Situations of that nature don’t
present difficulties for me.
(checks his numbers)

And this is indicating that my metabolic levels are increasing only now, as we approach the core.
(beat; to himself)
I, I have to address this...

FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
Should we wait to enter?
(beat)
Perhaps you’re getting anxious

about what you’ll find there--

ROY MCBRIDE
(interrupts)

No.	We must enter the core.


INT. UNDERGROUND CORRIDOR

They MOVE THROUGH the corridor to:


INT. UNDERGROUND CHAMBER - THE CORE

A massive chamber. Roy and Francesca come ACROSS THE ENORMOUS BASE of the REACTOR. A FLICKERING SERIES of FLUORESCENT LIGHTS illuminate HALF the ROOM. It looks almost lived-in, frozen in time. Like there should be half-drunk cups of coffee on the consoles.

Francesca DeSanctis’s back is to ROY.

ROY MCBRIDE
Is this it, Ma’am?

FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
Yes.

ROY MCBRIDE
All right. Ma’am, I have to inform you, I’ve got an operation I need to conduct shortly, and it’s classified. So...you’re not going to be able to remain here.
(MORE)
 
78.

ROY MCBRIDE (CONT'D)
(beat)

I’m sorry.

She LIFTS THE HELMET OFF HER HEAD. We STARE FOR A BEAT at the BACK OF HER HEAD. Then:

ROY MCBRIDE (CONT’D)
Ma’am?	Did you hear what I said?

FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
Did it--ever seem possible that you might find out something about yourself? Something that might-- change you?

ROY MCBRIDE
I don’t know exactly what you’re
referring to.	As I said, I have
some objectives, and our
conversation has to be terminated

now.

FRANCESCA REACHES OVER, HITS a LARGE KEY on a console. A RECTANGULAR MONITOR begins to PLAY IMAGES WE’VE SEEN, of the boy and girl at THE CLOISTERS!

FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
It always felt like we were
destined to meet again.	Like it

was fate.

THIS TIME, we SEE the ENTIRE SET OF IMAGES. A LARGE FAMILY, at THE CLOISTERS. THE YOUNG BOY is DRAWING for a somewhat older GIRL. A SMALL PICNIC, or PARTY... AND the GIRL MOVES to SIT ON...

H. CLIFFORD McBRIDE’S LAP. The BOY HANDS A DRAWING TO THE GIRL.

FRANCESCA DESANCTIS (CONT’D) It’s the only time I saw you, the only time I was on earth. But--I feel as though I know you so well. Your father photographed you a lot

as a child. And I still look at the pictures and the videos all the time. So...I feel very connected to you.
(beat)
I wish you knew about me.

ROY IS FLUSTERED. FOR THE FIRST TIME in our STORY, HE IS TRULY THROWN.
 
79.


The RADIO begins to SOUND in ROY’S HEAD:

COMMAND RADIO
Major, we are registering her non-compliance. We are within ten meters, ready to engage.

She TURNS TOWARD HIM and US, HOLDING a BLACK FOLDER in HER HANDS. She takes a step toward him. He reaches down, toward his PULSE WEAPON.

FRANCESCA DESANCTIS Your father was so lonely in his travels. He had another life here, on Mars. Another family.

She smiles to him, gently--a genuine though somehow melancholy smile.

FRANCESCA DESANCTIS (CONT’D)
He is my father, too.

FRANCESCA DESANCTIS then PUSHES THE BLACK FOLDER toward ROY.
She FLIPS IT OPEN.

IT IS THE DRAWING THAT THE BOY GAVE THE GIRL in the VIDEO.

ROY LOOKS AT THE DRAWING. It’s incontrovertible. HE REALIZES. It’s TRUE.

FRANCESCA DESANCTIS (CONT’D)
He wanted me to reach out to you. I was afraid you couldn’t be trusted at first. But then I lost touch with him and when I saw you, I knew it was the right thing to do.
(beat)
I called for you, Roy.	The
messages were from me.

HE APPROACHES the SCREEN. NOW IT IS FOOTAGE OF ROY through the YEARS, beyond the IMAGES we’ve seen. HIM AS A TODDLER, AS A TEEN, AS A CADET. FRANCESCA is NOW BEHIND HIM AGAIN.

COMMAND RADIO
Major, we are ready to intercede.

ROY MCBRIDE
What...is it you want from me...?

HIS EYES BEGIN TO WATER. YES, WE ARE SEEING TEARS BEGIN TO FORM IN HIS EYES!
 
80.


FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
He needs our help.

ROY MCBRIDE
(for himself)

Dr. McBride...abandoned me...

FRANCESCA DESANCTIS Your father went to Neptune to try and save us.

Now Francesca, emotional as well, her back to us again:

FRANCESCA DESANCTIS (CONT’D) The mission went too far from the Earth, and many in the crew went insane...
(over her shoulder, to
Roy)
You’ve seen for yourself how hard
it becomes when the Earth is no
longer visible.	When they
attempted their sabotage, he did
what he had to do to continue on.
(eyes back down to the
floor)

He is a truly great man. He told me they found antimatter, that he wanted to make it all anew. But he’s gone silent now. All his findings have stopped being sent to Earth. I am concerned--I worry for him so much...
(she turns to Roy)
He needs our help.	I can locate
him.	I will give that to you.

Roy STARES AT HER for a MOMENT. Lost, almost as if he’s short circuited:

ROY MCBRIDE
I have...my own...directives.

She approaches him:

FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
We’re his family.	He had no way
back, but maybe you will.
(beat)

Please. He needs our help! He cared about you, he did. HE LOVED YOU, all this time. I know he did--
 
81.


HE IS SHAKING. A BEEPING BEGINS; it’s his VITALS, on his SLEEVE. THEY’RE OUT OF CONTROL!

She touches his arm with tenderness.

ALL OF A SUDDEN:

The DUCTS SLIDE OPEN. STEPPING IN: TANNER and YOSHIDA, in their suits. POINTING WEAPONS RIGHT AT HER. The THREAT is clear. FRANCESCA is startled. To her:

ALAN TANNER
Down!	On your knees!	Right now!

Roy begins to approach Francesca. The others intervene. A CHAOS BUILDS. AS TANNER PULLS OUT a STRANGE CORD:

ALAN TANNER (CONT’D) We’ll handle the interrogation from this point forward, Major.

ROY MCBRIDE
She--she may well have information only I can access here!

ALAN TANNER
Major, you are currently under no
condition to continue this

interview.

ROY MCRIDE
That’s incorrect. It’s imperative that you interrogate her with me present--

AS TANNER ATTACHES IT TO HER:

ALAN TANNER
Orders are now that you are to
retrieve all relevant data and
return to the Cepheus.	There is a
shuttle waiting for you.	She’ll be

processed appropriately.

TANNER PULLS HER AWAY. SHE IS YANKED OUT OF THE SPACE, and as she IS, SHE STARES AT ROY as the two EXIT. Yoshida remains, with Roy.

Roy MOVES to the CONSOLE, where his FAMILY HISTORY CONTINUES TO PLAY OUT IN FRONT OF HIM:

FRANKLIN YOSHIDA
Major, we have to proceed now.
 
82.


Roy does not move.	LIKE A SHORT CIRCUIT.

FRANKLIN YOSHIDA (CONT’D)
Major.
(beat)
MAJOR.
(beat)
YOUR ORDERS ARE TO RETRIEVE THE
DATA CELLS AND RETURN TO THE
CEPHEUS.

YOSHIDA DEPARTS. ROY MOVES TO THE CONSOLE and BEGINS TO REMOVE THE DATA CARD FROM THE BOARD, UNSCREWING THE CARDS.

THE IMAGES OF HIM DISAPPEAR FROM THE SCREEN as he TAKES ALL THE INTEL HE CAN.


EXT. MARS SURFACE - LATER

ROY EMERGES, boards the automated, driverless GPS-guided ROVER THAT IS WAITING FOR HIM.


INT. SPACE ELEVATOR

CLOSE ON ROY...in the silent elevator car as it lifts up, away from Mars.


INT./EXT. DOCKING PLATFORM

Roy ENTERS/FLOATS INTO the DECK, returning from the elevator.
Roy retreats inward at the sight of Colonel Lipset:

ROY MCBRIDE
(distant)

The tasks are completed. Everything from the core’s system’s been obtained...

COLONEL LIPSET
I’m sorry, Roy. SPACECOM and I felt it necessary to contact your associates from your trip to Mars. Your behavior with them did cause concern. We have fully briefed them now.

ROY MCBRIDE
Concern...?
 
83.


ALAN TANNER
You sent data into space. You also neglected to take your sedative capsule, and you protested the response to a standard mayday call.

ROY MCBRIDE
(sotto)

You know why I resisted now...

A WARNING LIGHT GOES OFF on the console.

FRANKLIN YOSHIDA
I’d recommend a sedative for you,

Major.

ROY MCBRIDE
NO. My metabolics will return to normal in just a moment. The environment on Mars was high-stress, and it was a standard reaction. I just need to do this--

Roy ATTACHES the DATA BOX to the Cepheus. DATA BEGINS TO FLOW from it into the craft’s computer.

Yoshida tries to hand Roy a pill and a cup of water.

FRANKLIN YOSHIDA
Major--

COLONEL LIPSET
Major, take the sedative--

ROY MCBRIDE
I HAVE TO DO THIS RIGHT NOW.	THIS
IS MY TASK.

Roy PUSHES THEM AWAY.	Alan Tanner looks to Donald Scobee.

Scobee moves to speak into the console as the Cepheus DECOUPLES FROM the elevator’s docking platform:

DONALD SCOBEE
SpaceCom, we are ready to proceed.

ANGLE ON ROY as he is turned inward. No eye contact with the rest of the crew.

FRANKLIN YOSHIDA
Major, I’m going to have to insist.
 
84.


ROY MCBRIDE
(to Colonel Lipset)
What--was the result of your

interrogation of Ms. DeSanctis?

The men have no reaction at first.

ROY MCBRIDE (CONT’D)
Did you gain any further

information from her?

Then, without a word, LIPSET REACHES OVER and PRESSES a BUTTON ON the CRAFT’S CONSOLE MONITOR. He types in something, and on comes a SURVEILLANCE CAMERA IMAGE:

THE SURVEILLANCE IMAGE is of Francesca DeSanctis, seated, in what looks like a small white room with a dropped ceiling and fluorescent light. We hear some MURMURING, which is UNINTELLIGIBLE from her, and from the others who surround her.

ROY WATCHES, IN TURMOIL.

The MEN who surround her are our team: Lipset, Tanner, Scobee, Yoshida. They are at moments on, and offscreen, their backs to us. They appear to be interrogating her. We HEAR SNIPPETS.

“What were you doing there...?”

“You are sitting there, without any...”

She isn’t looking at them.	Entering the FRAME is LIPSET:

COLONEL LIPSET
LOOK AT US.

After a BEAT:

FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
I won’t speak to you until Major
McBride is here.	He needs to be

present.

COLONEL LIPSET
Major McBride is not part of this
particular operation.	So you’re
going to need to respond to us--

right now, Ma’am.

FRANCESCA DESANCTIS You don’t understand. I am not your enemy. You’re talking to me like I’m your enemy--and I am not.
 
85.


COLONEL LIPSET
You are admitting that Clifford McBride is your father, and you’ve been in contact with him. That’s correct, is it not?

She stares at Lipset.

COLONEL LIPSET (CONT’D)
You’re aware he is posing a

potentially catastrophic threat?

FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
I need to see my brother.	Major
McBride.

COLONEL LIPSET
WHAT IS THE PRECISE LOCATION OF THE

LIMA PROJECT?

FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
I need to see my brother.

She STANDS UP. TANNER MOVES BEHIND HER with INCREDIBLE SPEED. As this is happening--

LIPSET THROWS her BACK, to the CHAIR. VIOLENTLY. But she still TRIES TO GET UP, so LIPSET SLAPS HER, HARD, ACROSS THE FACE.

She FLAILS. The MEN CHARGE AT HER, and TANNER PUTS her in a CHOKEHOLD. Francesca starts to GASP. And SHAKE.

FRANCESCA DESANCTIS (CONT’D)
I--I need help--

DONALD SCOBEE
If you want help, you’ll tell us--

Francesca SHAKES VIOLENTLY NOW.	Is it a SEIZURE...?

FRANKLIN YOSHIDA
Hold it, hold on there--whoa--

SHE CRUMPLES TO THE GROUND, her body VIBRATING with uncontrollable force. WEIRDLY QUIET, FAST...

TANNER PUTS HIS KNEE ON HER BACK.	We HEAR the men through
MUFFLED SOUND:

THE IMAGE ENDS.	BACK TO:
 
86.


INT. THE CEPHEUS - COCKPIT

Where the men are now ominously surrounding Roy. Tanner at the controls, initiating STAGE-1 liftoff away from the dock:

ALAN TANNER
...Booster looking good at 4 minutes. Level sense arm at 8 plus 17; outboard cut-off at 9 plus 11...

ROY MCBRIDE
(disturbed)

Where--where is she?

COLONEL LIPSET
The subject is dead. She stopped breathing and couldn’t be revived. But we extracted the coordinates of the Lima Project transmissions. From the Mars reactor data. We

know where to go.

ROY MCBRIDE
(interior)

You...killed her?

FRANKLIN YOSHIDA
It was likely some kind of

congenital disorder.

ROY’S RAGE is building.

COLONEL LIPSET
Major, your contribution to this

mission has come to a close.

The ship’s STAGE-1 thrusters (minor, low-velocity) are FIRING, powering the ship away from the Helios’s upper station (the top of the space elevator).

ROY MCBRIDE
(reverts to form)
What’s--what’s important here

is...the mission.

COLONEL LIPSET
We’re appreciative of your

contributions.

ROY MCBRIDE
I have followed orders and accomplished my objective. I need to brief SpaceCom.
 
87.


FRANKLIN YOSHIDA
SpaceCom’s already fully aware of
the situation.	You failed your

last two psych-evals.

Roy stops himself. He sees them surrounding him. Scobee is in front of a control panel.

The Cepheus has reached a safe radius, about a mile away... So the STAGE-2, high-power rocket thrusters now have room to fire safely. Tanner initiates Stage-2 procedure, a COUNTDOWN begins.

The suspense intensifies, and it’s eerie, as everyone’s just floating, suspended, waiting...

Roy’s FACE GOES WHITE.

COLONEL LIPSET
Major.	We don't want to have to
eliminate you.

Yoshida moves towards Roy.

Yoshida continues forward, towards Roy--Roy’s eyes burn with intensity. Tanner GRASPS his PULSE WEAPON.

It’s clear they do want him DEAD. Scobee APPROACHES Roy, too. Lipset stays back. Just as Scobee is near Roy--

Roy IGNITES his MMU's BOOT JETS, which blow Scobee back against the opposite wall with such force that Scobee’s KILLED instantly, and he CRUSHES AND KILLS Lipset--behind him--as well by the force of his body.

The OTHERS MOVE TO ROY, who--PULLS DOWN on a THRUSTER on the CONSOLE of the CRAFT.

The ENTIRE CRAFT BEGINS TO REVOLVE, MAKING A FULL REVOLUTION every SECOND.

The CENTRIFUGAL FORCE PUSHES EVERYTHING to the SIDES of the craft--all the CLIPBOARDS, FLIGHT PLANS, PENS, PROCEDURE BOARDS, etc. STICK TO THE WALLS.

The MEN are all SHAKEN up. Completely DISORIENTED for a moment.

Tanner is shaken loose and hit hard, but he’s only stunned.

By this point, Yoshida ATTACKS Roy with vicious BLOWS.

Roy LURCHES TOWARD the WALL of the CAPSULE; HE PULLS a small, metal CANNISTER that is strapped to the wall near him.
 
88.


He swings the cannister at Yoshida and connects with Yoshida’s skull. Yoshida tumbles away.

Now, it's just Roy and Tanner. Roy is bleeding. Tanner is holding a PULSE WEAPON. All Roy has is the cannister. But with the CRAFT SPINNING, it’s virtually impossible to AIM.

Tanner pulls the trigger--the weapon BLASTS.

Roy manages to twist out of the way of what was bad aim due to the spinning. The BLAST barely misses him.

ROY GRABS a PEN from the SIDE OF THE CRAFT.

He STABS YOSHIDA in the NECK. YOSHIDA’S BLOOD BLOOMS. This FORMS GLOBULES of BLOOD in the WEIGHTLESSNESS!

Roy uses the moment to EVADE Tanner. Utilizing the NETTING/WIRING along the side of the ship, Roy scrambles away.

The SUNLIGHT COMES THROUGH the WINDOWS FLASHES AS FAST AS A STROBE LIGHT...


INT. THE CEPHEUS - ANOTHER AREA - CONTINUOUS

Roy moves around a CORNER, disappearing into a DARKER area of the ship...


INT. THE CEPHEUS - COCKPIT -

Tanner PULLS the REENTRY LEVER over his head. The CRAFT STOPS SPINNING. HE wraps YOSHIDA’S WOUND with a TOWEL, to stop the blood. He TURNS BACK AROUND to FOLLOW/KILL ROY.


INT. THE CEPHEUS - ANOTHER AREA - CONTINUOUS

Tanner pursues Roy.

Tanner presses a BUTTON to OPEN the fairing door, and leans into that section, when...

Suddenly, Roy emerges from the tangle of WIRES AND OTHER MATERIAL against the wall where he’d been hiding, and SHOVES Tanner deep into the fairing section.

And Roy presses the button to CLOSE the fairing section door. He’s trapped Tanner in this part of the ship.
 
89.


The Stage-2 COUNTDOWN approaches liftoff, and Roy hurries to the safety of a harness just in time. He holds onto the harness as the Cepheus EXPLODES FORWARD.

As the STAGING occurs, and the INTER-STAGE FAIRING SECTION and ROCKET ENGINE beneath it can be seen through the window below Roy, falling away into the void.

NOTE: The physical environment in the ship is now especially CHAOTIC and MESSY: Wiring, equipment, debris, balls of blood and sweat... all criss-crossing this way and that in the zero-g...


INT. THE CEPHEUS - COCKPIT

Roy moves into the cockpit.

He check’s Yoshida’s pulse. Nothing. Yoshida is now DEAD. Roy eyes the floating CORPSES of former crewmates Scobee and Yoshida.


INT. THE CEPHEUS - AIRLOCK

Roy prepares the two bodies with none of the ceremony or religion that were afforded to Blunt. He leaves them in the airlock and steps out, back into--


INT. THE CEPHEUS - OUTSIDE AIRLOCK

He presses a button to open the airlock to the void.


EXT. SPACE - THE CEPHEUS

THE SHIP RELEASES THE TWO BODIES as the Cepheus speeds away...


INT. COCKPIT

Roy grabs a fresh helmet and moves into the cockpit. A man ALONE. He PAUSES FOR A MOMENT; his HANDS are BLOTCHY and BLEEDING...

ROCKET COMPUTER VOICE
Significant damage to rocket
staging capability... Reentry
protection in section THREE

DESTROYED...
 
90.


EXT. THE CEPHEUS - SPACE

The spaceship is moving at such a terrific velocity that there’s PERCEPTIBLE MOVEMENT in the surrounding field of stars: APPROACHING STARS appear blue, RECEDING STARS become amber. (This is the “red shift” effect.)


INT. COCKPIT

Roy is seated at the fore of the ship. He’s still BLEEDING PROFUSELY. He goes through a MEDICAL KIT, applies GELS to his wound. He’s trying to stem the seeping tide of blood.

He is ghostly and alone in the ship’s DARKNESS. And outside of the ship’s darkness: INFINITE PITCH BLACK.

But... finally... a slight GLOW appears from the COCKPIT MONITOR...

ROY MCBRIDE
Destination, Neptune Moon Galatea

coordinates.

COMPUTER VOICE
Length of journey: 19 days, 4
hours, 8 minutes.	Sedation is

advised.

Roy HOOKS HIMSELF UP to a FEED TUBE, into his arm. He BUCKLES HIMSELF IN, and straps start sending ELECTRICAL PULSES to his body, to keep his muscles in some sort of tone.

Roy SETTLES IN, and the ROCKETS ALIGHT... He is on his way...

DISSOLVE TO:


EXT. SPACE

The craft PASSES an UNMANNED SPACE PROBE...

A distant ASTEROID FIELD...	JUPITER, distant...


INT. CEPHEUS

Roy examines the view outside his window.	He grows AGITATED.

ALL OF A SUDDEN, BLOOD STARTS POURING INTO THE CRAFT, from EVERY WALL!

It FILLS THE CAPSULE!
 
91.


YOSHIDA and SCOBEE are BACK, INSIDE. They ARE ASSAULTING ROY!

THE CAPSULE BEGINS SPINNING AGAIN!

WHAT IS HAPPENING?

And then--

THROUGH THE SPINNING--he REACHES over to the console and injects something into his arm.

Within moments, the craft is no longer spinning. THE ASTRONAUTS ARE GONE.

HE WAS HALLUCINATING...

DISSOLVE TO:


EXT. SPACE - SATURN - LATER

The giant gas planet SATURN looms magnificently against the black backdrop. Its RINGS look like thin ribbons encircling the planet. So perfect is this gas giant, so symmetrical and flawless in its geometry... it almost looks UNREAL.

We TILT DOWN to SEE the Cepheus PASS US BY.


INT. CEPHEUS

Roy’s EYES ARE HALF-MAST. His P.O.V.: A WATERY surface over his eyes causes a slight oblong, double-vision VIEW of the CAPSULE CONSOLE.

COMPUTER VOICE
Now passing final unmanned outpost, Trojan QF99. Conserve oxygen and food supply if possible--

ROY CLOSES HIS EYES.

DISSOLVE TO:


EXT. SPACE - URANUS

The planet, in the distance.	Roy’s spacecraft passes it...

DISSOLVE TO:
 
92.


INT. CEPHEUS

SOUNDS. It’s a 1930’s RADIO SHOW that somehow his craft has picked up. ROY’S EYES OPEN.

A STRANGE and NATURAL and UNEXPLAINED SPACE PHENOMENON OCCURS.

What looks like FIREFLIES FLOWS through the CAPSULE. It’s HALLUCINATORY and ROY SEES THEM through SEDATED EYES.

He REACHES UP to TOUCH THEM; the SPARKS SEEM TO FLOAT RIGHT THROUGH his HANDS. (These unexplained phenomena do exist.)

His BODY BEGINS TO LIFT UP, OUT OF THE SEAT. He STAYS in PLACE because of the seatbelts.

His BREATHING BECOMES HEAVIER.	Close to some kind of panic.

Roy starts to HYPERVENTILATE, STRUGGLING. He INJECTS something into his arm. As we:

CUT TO:


EXT. SPACE - NEPTUNE

The BLUE PLANET.	STILL.	EERIE.


INT. CEPHEUS

A CHIME:

COMPUTER VOICE
Task Load Index completed.

ROY UNBUCKLES HIMSELF.

MOVES back to the PILOT’S SEAT.


EXT. SPACE - NEAR NEPTUNE

Now: Roy’s spaceship, the Cepheus, comes into view, its RETRO-THRUSTERS firing on full blast (in utter silence) to slow its velocity.

NEW ANGLE

More prominently now, THE RINGS OF NEPTUNE.

CLOSER ANGLE
 
93.


On one of the OUTER RINGS. The Cepheus is tiny against the magnificent vista.


INT. CEPHEUS

Roy PILOTS the CRAFT as it nears the EDGE of the rings, and keeps pace with the speed of the rings’ orbit.

Roy LOOKS DOWN at the CONSOLE.	BLINKING:

“CRAFT OXYGEN LEVEL: 12 PERCENT”

He LOOKS OUT HIS WINDOW and is momentarily energized by Neptune’s BLUE GLOW. The rings are more visible now. They are magnificent, comprised of various-sized ROCKS of dirt and ice that circle around us, almost like cars on a racetrack.

Roy looks at the control panels, the monitors.

ROY MCBRIDE
Locate signal source.

COMPUTER VOICE
The source is [scientifically

correct location, tbd].

He PULLS a LARGE SWITCH.

The cockpit board flashes: “AUTOPILOT ENGAGED”.

ROY PUNCHES THE GALATEA COORDINATES into his SPACESUIT SLEEVE.

A BLINKING RED LIGHT on the CONSOLE.

He REACHES OVER, TOGGLES THE SWITCH:


EXT. THE CEPHEUS - CONTINUOUS

Roy EMERGES from the craft, in his suit. He REMAINS TETHERED TO THE CRAFT. The CRAFT, moving along with the orbiting rings of detritus, begins to move closer to the rings...

CLOSER TO THE RINGS

He maneuvers his way BEHIND THE COCKPIT SECTION of the craft, so he is protected FROM the DETRITUS of NEPTUNE’S RINGS by the CRAFT’S BODY ITSELF.

He REMOVES a SMALL SOLAR PANEL--ABOUT FIVE FEET IN LENGTH, and about THREE FEET IN WIDTH--from the SIDE OF THE CEPHEUS.
 
94.


He CLIMBS to the ROTATING ARTIFICIAL GRAVITY WHEEL.

He GRABS ONTO ONE OF THE SPINNING WINDMILL-LIKE BLADES.

HE UNHOOKS HIS TETHER.

HE HOLDS ON.

SPINNING AND SPINNING. DIZZYING.

HE LOOKS AT HIS SLEEVE. A COMPASS NUMBER KEEPS SCANNING different DIRECTIONAL COORDINATES.

AND THEN--at JUST THE RIGHT MOMENT--

HE LETS GO.

HE IS PROPELLED THROUGH SPACE, without his TETHER.


EXT. THROUGH THE RINGS

He enters the rings. Miniscule particles begin to hit the SOLAR PANEL that ROY USES AS HIS SHIELD.

Some come insanely close to ROY, to his HEAD, to puncturing his SUIT.

The SOLAR PANEL is GETTING NICKED and DAMAGED by the PARTICULATE, but it protects Roy.


EXT. CLOUDS OF NEPTUNE

He TUMBLES FURTHER, now ENTERING THE CLOUDS OF NEPTUNE.

The CLOUDS are DENSE, like bad CLOUD COVER during an airplane flight. EXCEPT--THEY ARE A RICH, INTENSE BLUE.

As Roy TUMBLES, the SHADE OF THE CLOUDS goes from that BLUE to a BEAUTIFUL and BEYOND-THIS-EARTH PINK, then to a DEEP MAGENTA.

AND THEN IT BEGINS TO APPEAR, EVER SO FAINTLY.

A SPACECRAFT.

It is TETHERED to the slowly ROTATING MOON CALLED GALATEA which orbits NEPTUNE inside Neptune’s atmosphere.

It is THE LIMA PROJECT.

CLOSER AND CLOSER it comes to us. ROY SEEMS SPINNING TOWARD IT, OUT OF CONTROL.
 
95.


And then he THROWS the THRUSTER in his PACK. His tumbling GRADUALLY GETS UNDER CONTROL.

He STOPS. OUTSIDE THE LIMA PROJECT STATION. IN the DISTANCE: a SYMMETRICAL SERIES of SCANNING MIRROR TELESCOPES. In a LATTICE.

NEW ANGLE OF ROY - behind him, in the deep distance, is Earth, a tiny pinprick of light 900 million miles away. (See recent Cassini photograph.) Then, CUT TO WHAT HE SEES:

Hovering over the station, still far away from Roy, are:

ASTRONAUTS. Appearing as figures on the dark blue horizon, levitating over NEPTUNE.

THE LINE OF ASTRONAUTS FLOATS, STILL.

ROY PUSHES a BUTTON on his WRIST.	We HEAR STATIC.

ROY MCBRIDE
LIMA PROJECT.	This is Major Roy
McBride.	I have taken control of
the Cepheus, United States Armed
Forces Space Division.	I am
attempting to reach Dr. Clifford

McBride.	Over.

Static.	No movement.

ROY MCBRIDE (CONT’D) Repeat: Lima Project, this is the Cepheus, of the United States Armed Forces Space Division. I am attempting to reach Dr. McBride. Do you read.

NO RESPONSE.

ROY TURNS his RIGHT WRIST OVER.

“MMU OXYGEN LEVEL: 21 PERCENT”

“THRUST LEVEL: 39 PERCENT”

HE MOVES toward the SURFACE of the LIMA PROJECT STATION. As HE DOES, he LOOKS to his RIGHT to SEE, maybe a mile away (hard to tell relative direction here), the very BEGINNINGS of a graphene arc.
 
96.


EXT./INT. LIMA PROJECT STATION

Roy “floats” inside. The Craft/Station has a kind of LARGE A-FRAME.

Roy VENTURES through the CENTER of the STATION.

HUGE SPACES filled with SELF-REPLICATORS that do not resemble anything anthropormorphic, but rather look like the kind of machines which make AUTOMOBILES. WE HEAR Roy’s BREATHING.

ROY’S P.O.V. - The robots are in repose, ready to be awakened. WE CONTINUE TO HEAR Roy’s BREATHING...

He passes the anthropoid robots, and enters another, even larger, area.

ROY’S P.O.V. - A flurry of automated activity, as we pass EVERY SPECIES OF ROBOT, from giant vehicles to small, squat machines, gliding to and fro. Some are fitted with grabs and manipulators and cutting/welding equipment.

Again, no sign of humans. The robots move slowly, with secret purpose, WARNING LIGHTS whirling for the benefit of the unseen humans.


INT. INNER SANCTUM

ROY now ventures to SEE, on both sides:

WINDOWS, through which we can spot the INTERIOR of the LIMA PROJECT.

As Roy makes some final adjustments to his equipment, we notice one of the very small robots on the side of the A-Frame. A CAMERA mounted on it silently ROTATES towards Roy, and a RED LIGHT blinks on next to the camera. It knows Roy is here. Roy LOOKS RIGHT INTO IT:

ROY MCBRIDE
I am Major Roy McBride. Do you read. I am attempting to reach Dr. McBride.

AGAIN, no ANSWER. ROY PLACES EXPLOSIVE CHARGES on the DOORFRAME of the LIMA STATION.

They BLOW.

Just then, an APERTURE on the station opens up. ROY VENTURES INSIDE. LIKE HE IS ENTERING A DREAM.
 
97.


INT. LIMA PROJECT - DORMITORIES

HUMAN BODIES are FLOATING, gravity-free. The FLUORESCENT LIGHTS FLICKER.

We STILL HEAR ONLY ROY’S BREATHING. LOUD, PRESENT. We ARE COMPLETELY INSIDE HIS HEAD.

Roy finds himself inside a KITCHEN-TYPE area, which is housed somewhere within a laboratory. There are machines and equipment and tables and sinks, but no people besides Roy.

There’s ZERO GRAVITY here.

ROY’S POINT-OF-VIEW:

A DOOR IS OPEN, revealing a dark PASSAGEWAY lit only by BLUE LIGHT.


INT. PASSAGEWAY

Roy enters/floats into it. ALL OF A SUDDEN, ALL THE MONITORS on each side--and there are several--switch on. THE LIGHTS BRIGHTEN. ON THE SCREENS: ROY’S FATHER! DR. H. CLIFFORD MCBRIDE. Roy HALTS:

H. CLIFFORD MCBRIDE This will be the final message recorded by the Lima Project. Our efforts have come to an end, and its entire story must be told in the hopes that someday it will be known.

ROY MOVES CLOSER TO THE SCREEN. It is his FATHER, virtually seeming to speak from the dead:

H. CLIFFORD MCBRIDE (CONT’D) We came here to pursue mankind’s most noble goal: the search for intelligent life beyond the Earth.

But our telescope has repeatedly confirmed only the singular importance--and ephemerality--of our moon, oceans, and magnetic field. After extensive analysis, we now confirm that we are entirely alone in the reachable universe. We shall no longer honor false gods; there is no intelligent life elsewhere, and the rage of the cosmos will destroy us in time.
(MORE)
 
98.

H. CLIFFORD MCBRIDE (CONT’D) For this reason, we on the Lima Project had begun to devise a plan for a new system--with galaxies, stars, and planets. We dreamed to be the first lifeform to make the

universe anew.

CLOSE ANGLE ON ROY MCBRIDE.

CUT TO:


INT. NARROW STAIRWELL

Roy CLIMBS the STEPS.	We STILL HEAR, CONTINUING:

H. CLIFFORD MCBRIDE (V.O) With the vast stores of antimatter we have discovered here, our research focused on the creation of a new big bang. Such a project would take perhaps several thousand years to develop. But only such a bold, long-term endeavor would untether us from the earth and ensure the permanent survival of our species.


INT. CONTROL CENTER - STATION

Roy FLOATS TOWARD the Control Center. Like the Control Tower of a large airport, it’s somewhat dark--but everything is ON. Multiple MONITORS, SCREENS, GAUGES, etc., all like a symphony of blinking, fluttering color and light.

H. CLIFFORD MCBRIDE (V.O) Our research is contained on the onboard VD recorder. It is the most extensive set of data ever assembled about the visible universe. This must be brought back to Earth so that our scientists can be convinced to act. However, our computer system is currently preventing all outside communication. As it is charged only with the continued pursuit of intelligent life, it has been unable to adapt to our changed prerogatives. All attempts to reprogram it have failed. With no alternatives, we sought to return to the Earth.

Roy looks around at the many screens in front of him; they are like SECURITY CAMERAS, constantly cutting from one angle to another. ONE ANGLE REVEALS:

A SPACECRAFT, with a GANTRY. MODEST SIZE. CLOSE SHOT ON ROY. THEN CLOSE SHOT ON IMAGE OF SPACECRAFT. THEN:

ROY SCANS THROUGH BASIC BLUEPRINT PLANS of the LIMA PROJECT’s CRAFT.


INT. DATABANKS - LIMA PROJECT

It is ROWS of DATA, stored. A CLOUD for all the information collected by the Project.

Roy FLOATS THROUGH IT, approaching TWO LARGE ORANGE STEEL CANNISTERS: “VOYAGE DATA RECORDER” He PULLS THEM OUT FROM THE FRAME. Over this, we STILL HEAR:

H. CLIFFORD MCBRIDE (CONT’D) A craft was assembled from 3-D-printed parts, piece by piece, out

of view of the onboard system. But it was recognized upon completion, and our nuclear fuel has been intentionally destroyed by the system. This resulted in the catastrophic destruction of moon Larissa. All of us have suffered severe radiation poisoning. Brain death is imminent. The onboard system will likely maintain only our organ function in order for it to remain operational.


INT. LIVING QUARTERS

CLOSE SHOT: “DR. CLIFF MCBRIDE”.	A PAPER TAB, HANDWRITTEN.
On the DOOR of his LIVING QUARTERS.

Roy FLOATS INTO/ENTERS the LIVING QUARTERS.

H. CLIFFORD MCBRIDE (V.O.) We hope we will be mourned by a Mother Earth that dared send so many of her sons and daughters into the unknown. In ancient days, human beings looked at stars and saw their heroes in the constellations. In modern times, our heroes have become creatures of flesh and blood.

100.

H. CLIFFORD MCBRIDE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Others will follow us, and surely
find their way home.	Our mission

must not be denied.

HE LOOKS AROUND. He SEES the SPACE. It is MODEST, with SCIENCE BOOKS, and DIARIES, and FAMILY PHOTOS everywhere, pinned on the WALLS. Then we HEAR Francesca’s VOICE, more PRESENT than CLIFFORD McBRIDE’S had been:

FRANCESCA’S VOICE
“The brain is wider than the sky,
for, put them side by side, the
other will include, with ease, and
you beside...”
(beat)
It’s so beautiful...	Do you want
to hear another one...?

Then, APPEARING: FRANCESCA! SEATED, SOMEHOW STILL OBEYING GRAVITY as ROY FLOATS! She STARES, saying nothing.

Roy doesn’t know what to do, or say.	He STOPS HIS MOVEMENT.
He lifts his ARM toward her...

She GETS UP, begins to WALK TOWARD ROY!!

NEAR HIM NOW, HE REACHES OUT, and...

HIS HAND AND ARM GO RIGHT THROUGH HER!!!! SHE WALKS RIGHT THROUGH HIM, sits down at the other end.

Roy LOOKS AROUND THE SPACE and SEES NOW that it’s like his home where he grew up, his home from pictures. PROJECTED.

IT’S ALL HOLOGRAMS.

He SEES: HIMSELF, as a CHILD, on the FLOOR, PLAYING WITH TRUCKS. And his MOTHER, LEANNE, YOUNGER. His HAND can go right through them, too.

(As ROY FLOATS, these HOLOGRAMS remain “earthbound”; that is, they seem to have “gravity”.)

Roy TURNS BACK to LOOK AT FRANCESCA. She is in conversation with someone “offscreen,” smiling, looking lovely and warm and everything an idealized version of her would be.


CLOSE ANGLE ON ROY.

We HEAR the PITTER-PATTER of RAIN. RAIN? ALL OTHER SOUND DROPS OUT. And we:

CUT TO:
 
101.


EXT. NEW YORK - THE CLOISTERS - RAINY DAY

A lowered gray sky. Deserted. A monastery on the UPPER WEST SIDE of NEW YORK’S MANHATTAN ISLAND. A PORTCULLIS. COBBLESTONES. The VIDEO we saw, yes, but now we are “here,” in the space.

A GROUP of children PLAY. ADULTS speak to each other, standing behind the children, watching them play, making small talk. The scene has a strange, dare we say, unearthly quality to it. There is a distance to it; not an emotional distance, but a visual distance. A haze, almost. A dreamlike quality.

A SMALLER GROUP of adults, and two children, are here, too.
They are nearby and yet somehow apart.

We SEE: ROY’S MOTHER, LEANNE. Much YOUNGER. She seems PREOCCUPIED, though she smiles a lot as she attends to the children. Also here is some other woman we don’t know, about Leanne’s age. She is completely quiet, almost nervous, as she watches the children play.

Then there is H. CLIFFORD MCBRIDE, who is involved with the children, making hats for them, drawing for them, joking with them.

AMONG THE CHILDREN: the young ROY. And the young FRANCESCA (though she is older than Roy--she seems around 16 or 17, he around 8). She has a grin from ear to ear; Roy does not, instead dedicated to whatever he seems to be DRAWING.

H. Clifford McBride stops clowning with another child and moves to Roy’s side. Warmly:

H. CLIFFORD MCBRIDE
Roy?
(beat)
Roy?
(to Young Francesca)

He gets very involved in what he’s doing.

YOUNG FRANCESCA
(a laugh; a smile)

It’s okay.

H. CLIFFORD MCBRIDE Sweetheart, I need you to listen to me for just a moment--you can go back to your drawing very soon.

Roy finally looks up--for just a brief beat.
 
102.


H. CLIFFORD MCBRIDE (CONT’D)
This is Francesca.

YOUNG FRANCESCA
(ebullient)

Hello!

ROY MCBRIDE
(back to his drawing)

Hi.

H. CLIFFORD MCBRIDE She’s someone...very close to me, someone I really care for. I want you to meet her--I think you’ll really like her.

Roy keeps drawing--AND THEN TURNS HIS BACK TO HER A BIT.

H. CLIFFORD MCBRIDE (CONT’D)
It’s not so easy for Roy to meet
new people.	It’s something we’re
trying to work on with him.
(quieter)

We’re hoping he’ll break through it someday...

Clifford approaches Roy. Not unsympathetically, he touches his son and attempts to communicate an important lesson about human interaction:

H. CLIFFORD MCBRIDE (CONT’D)
(to Roy)

When someone talks to you, you say hello, you look them in the eye. You listen, and you ask how they are--you don’t want them to think you don’t care about them.

Roy REACTS IMMEDIATELY. He starts to get teary out of embarrassment and awkwardness. Sensing this, she moves to comfort him:

YOUNG FRANCESCA
It’s okay, you can go back to your drawing. He just wanted us to meet.

Roy then eyes her directly, and without a word. She looks at his drawing. Warmly:

YOUNG FRANCESCA (CONT’D) That’s a wonderful picture. Is that a rocket?
 
103.


ROY MCBRIDE
(nods; then)

My father goes into space.

YOUNG FRANCESCA
That’s where I’m from.

ROY MCBRIDE
(looks up, interested now)

Where?

YOUNG FRANCESCA
I’m from Mars.	Which is really,
really far.

ROY MCBRIDE
Yeah. Sometimes it’s more than 140 million miles away. But right now it’s only 80 million miles.

YOUNG FRANCESCA
(again with a laugh)

I didn’t know that!

ROY MCBRIDE
Are you by yourself there?

YOUNG FRANCESCA
No, but it feels like that
sometimes.	That’s why I’m so glad

I met you.

UNEXPECTEDLY, responding to her kindness to such a degree he can overcome his shyness, he hands his drawing to her. Francesca looks at the drawing and she is very moved. TEARS OF HAPPINESS come to her eyes. Roy STARES at the tears as though they are foreign objects. The SWELL OF EMOTION from her is as strange as anything he has seen.

YOUNG FRANCESCA (CONT’D) Oh--thank you so much! That’s so sweet of you! It’s beautiful!

She gives him a BIG, TENDER HUG. Roy ALLOWS HIMSELF to be “crushed” by the hug.

Roy’s FATHER BEAMS...

DISSOLVE TO:
 
104.


INT. HULL OF CRAFT - CORNER OF MCBRIDE RESIDENTIAL QUARTERS

A chamber that appears almost like an old “Iron Lung” machine. Roy APPROACHES IT.

CLOSE SHOT: “MCBRIDE, CLIFFORD, 788919-0323”

It’s a small, illuminated medical identification card. WIDEN TO REVEAL:

ROY, COMING UPON his FATHER’S BODY, inside what looks like a kind of ELECTRONIC SARCOPHAGUS.

Dr. H. Clifford McBride exists in a vegetative state, resting in a large silver CASE. Through glass, we can SEE that his EYES ARE slightly OPEN, his BODY HOOKED UP to LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEMS.

MONITORS around the case MEASURE his PULSE and other VITAL SIGNS. He is KEPT COLD.

ROY moves to it, OPENS THE SARCOPHAGUS. STARES AT HIS FATHER’S LOBOTOMIZED FACE.

He LIFTS his FATHER’S STIFF, LIFELESS BODY out of its electronic SARCOPHAGUS, pulling off the DIODES and IVs which keep him “alive”.

When the body EMERGES from the SARCOPHAGUS, it seems almost to FLOAT STANDING STIFFLY UPRIGHT. It starts SPINNING IN THE WEIGHTLESSNESS.

ROY GRABS the SPINNING BODY, in a way that becomes an EMBRACE. PULLING THE BODY WITH HIM, he FLOATS BACK OUT...

CUT TO:


EXT. OUTSIDE THE LIMA PROJECT STATION - IN SPACE

ROY releases his FATHER’S BODY INTO SPACE, PUSHING IT TOWARD the SURFACE of NEPTUNE.

IN the DISTANCE, WE SEE H. CLIFFORD McBRIDE’S BODY drift TOWARD a RING AROUND NEPTUNE.

The BODY comes in contact with a SMALL ICE ROCK. It SHATTERS INTO A MILLION PIECES. LIKE BROKEN WINDSHIELD GLASS.

Almost at the VERY INSTANT that H. CLIFFORD McBRIDE’s BODY is destroyed, LIGHTS COME ON in a formerly DARKENED SECTION of the LIMA CRAFT.
 
105.


EXT. SPACE - NEAR THE LIMA CRAFT - OUTSIDE 3-D PRINTED CRAFT

A spacecraft which remains DOCKED. It has been constructed for Dr. Clifford McBride’s return, presumably. It NOW HUMS WITH LIFE.


INT. 3-D PRINTED CRAFT

Roy enters the cockpit, HOLDING the ORANGE VDR (”VOYAGE DATA RECORDER”) CANNISTERS.

Examining the craft’s SYSTEMS, he and we recognize that it is astonishingly similar to the Cepheus. (The spacecraft are all constructed by 3-D PRINTER, and there is a uniformity to their design and construction.)

The entire SYSTEM of the CRAFT COMES TO LIFE, ONLINE.

AS DOES: RADIO STATIC FROM THE EARTH! Communication has been restored:

ROY PRESSES THE RADIO BUTTON, TURNS DIALS FOR A CERTAIN CODE:

ROY MCBRIDE
SpaceCom.	This is Major Roy
McBride.	I have taken it upon
myself and have reached the Lima
Project; all crew are deceased.	I
have recovered significant material
for analysis, which I am now in the
process of forwarding to you.	The
self-replicators here malfunctioned
and must be destroyed to prevent
any unforseen further catastrophe.
Therefore, I’m inputting target
coordinates 34.34 North, 81.92 West
from Earth standard vector 100.
(beat)

I’m going to attempt a return to the earth now. The onboard system indicates I’ll be arriving in approximately 41 days and 9 hours. My journey will have kept me in an isolated state for a considerable period by that time. I...I am very much looking forward to the day that solitude ends. Over.

He FLIPS OFF THE RADIO.

He PULLS DOWN on a LARGE LEVER which looks almost like the kind of control switch for a 747 airplane.
 
106.


He moves around the CAPSULE, OBSERVING a PRINTED CHECKLIST.
Adjusts SEVERAL SWITCHES.

MOMENTS LATER

Roy is SETTLING IN to his COCKPIT SEAT. He is about to PUT an OXYGEN MASK ON. He activates the CRAFT’s GYROSCOPES and CONTROL STICK.

Then:

ROY MCBRIDE (CONT’D)
Outgoing mail.	McBride, Roy M.
Send to Leanne McBride.

He SEES an IMAGE of HIS MOTHER. It’s a photo of her, with him as a little boy. A little ANIMATED BEE flies around the picture, making a PUTT-PUTT SOUND.

ROY MCBRIDE (CONT’D)
Record voice message.

After a BEEP--Roy begins to record his message. As we know, he’s not much one for communicating--especially when emotions are concerned. But here...

ROY MCBRIDE (CONT’D) Mother, I’m on a classified mission right now.
(beat)
I am by myself.

THE CAMERA SLOWLY--almost imperceptively so--PUSHES INTO HIM:

ROY MCBRIDE (CONT’D)
(equivocating; then he
steels himself)

I am attempting now to return to the earth. In the event I cannot, I don’t want you to wonder about me.
(beat)
I’d like to express to you that I realize that you gave me an excellent childhood. I am grateful to you now for attempting to nurture friendships and other relationships. Perhaps you don’t think I remember much, but I do. Sometimes the smell of certain foods will bring back exceedingly pleasant memories... On this mission I’ve encountered people who knew father.
(MORE)
 
107.

ROY MCBRIDE (CONT’D) I don’t know how much you know about this, but it appears he had another child, a daughter named Francesca. We both met her once. She and I talked. She informed me that father acted out of the noblest principles. And that he sacrificed himself in the name of science.

He stops. TEARS WELL UP AGAIN. He CLOSES HIS EYES and BOWS HIS HEAD. Then begins to speak again:

ROY MCBRIDE (CONT’D) Mother, I, I was unable to protect her. I regret this--terribly. Even worse than I regret any negative feelings toward father. It’s led me to commit acts that you would condemn--but were required by circumstance. It has forced me to be alone, a situation I now find unacceptable.
(exhales; regroups)
But I have succeeded in my mission. I want to say goodbye now, and whatever occurs on my return, I am forever your loving son.

He SHUTS OFF the RECORDER. ANGLE ON THE FROZEN IMAGE of ROY’S MOTHER.


EXT. SPACE - 3-D PRINTED CRAFT

The Craft’s GANTRY RELEASES the ship.	Slowly.

The CRAFT begins to move, its ROCKETS FIRING.

Almost at the same time: A BEAM, HIGH-INTENSITY, HITS A PART OF THE STATION.

It EXPLODES! In SILENCE. The colors of the explosion, set against the DEEP BLACKNESS of SPACE.

Then another SILENT and COLORFUL EXPLOSION.


INT. 3-D PRINTED CRAFT

Roy looks through his windows to SEE:

A SERIES OF LASERS HITTING VARIOUS PARTS of the STATION and TELESCOPE.
 
108.


In SILENCE, the EXPLOSIONS ARE VAST, FEROCIOUS, and somehow oddly BEAUTIFUL.

They ILLUMINATE the dead BLACKNESS of SPACE even as they are utterly destructive, devastatingly so.


EXT. SPACE - 3-D PRINTED CRAFT

Roy’s ROCKET starts to STAGE, AFTER its initial BURST. It leaves the CONTINUED DEVASTATION of the LIMA PROJECT in its wake as it PROPELS FORWARD.


INT. 3-D PRINTED CRAFT

Roy’s HEAD SHAKES TO AND FRO; the ROCKET’S FORCE is ASTONISHING.


EXT. SPACE - 3-D PRINTED CRAFT

The CRAFT FIRES a NEW SET OF ROCKETS. It moves on, deeper and deeper and deeper toward the earth. The RADIO PIPES UP, and it’s in the most straightforward, almost banal, tone imaginable:

SPACECOM VOICE
Major McBride, this is SpaceCom. We have verified the authenticity of your coordinates and have begun to target sites accordingly. Upon reentry to earth’s orbit, we will intercept your craft and you will be debriefed. However, we do acknowledge the potential of your data files to transform rather radically our view of what the universe may hold.
(beat)

We wish you godspeed on your journey homeward. US SPACECOM out.

Finally, Roy’s ROCKET disappears from our view, hurtling back toward the EARTH.
