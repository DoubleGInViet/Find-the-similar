EXT. AN ANT MOUND - DAY

The camera swoops towards the entrance, then dives inside, past a couple of tough-looking soldier ants who stand at the gates of the ant colony like insect bouncers...into an access tunnel that snakes this way and that, past a row of ants plodding along...

...and into the MAIN CHAMBER of the colony, a huge, teeming vista that seems to stretch away forever, filled with ants rushing here and there on their business. We see -- a "traffic cop" directing foot traffic, waving his arms like
 

crazy so both sides move at once -- a column of soldier ants marching along in formation -- a chain of ants letting down a matchbox elevator filled with workers.


...which is kind of a problem, since I've always felt uncomfortably in crowds.

INT. MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR'S OFFICE - DAY

We join Z, a worker ant with issues. He's lying on a couch, recounting his woes.

Z

I feel...isolated. Different. I've got abandonment issues. My father flew away when I was just a larva. My mother didn't have much time for me...when you have five million siblings, it's difficult to get attention.

(pause)

I feel physically inadequate -- I've never been able to lift more than ten times my own weight. Sometimes I think I'm just not cut out to be a worker. But I don't have any other options. I was assigned to trade school when I was just a grub. The whole system just...makes me feel...insignificant.

MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR

(enthusiastic)
Terrific!	You should feel
insignificant!

For the first time, we see the ant MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR. He's a mixture of Tony Robbins and Ron Popiel (the hyperactive late-night TV huckster, and founder of "Ronco").

Z

...I should?

MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR

(hopping around
enthusiastically)
YES!!!	You know, people ask me,
"Doctor, why are you always happy?"
And I tell them it's mind over
matter.	I don't mind that I don't
 
matter!	Do you get it?	Do you get

it?

Z gives a fake smile.

MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR

(incredibly "up")

Z, we're part of the fastest growing species in the whole world!

The counsellor rolls down a chart from the wall. An arrow shows ant population going up, up, up.

MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR

Ask me why we're so successful.

Z

Why are we so successful?

MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR

I'm glad you asked me that question!

The motivational counsellor opens some blinds...and we see a vista of the ant-filled chamber below.

MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR

What do you see out there?

Z
...Ants...

MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR

Right! Ants! Millions of creatures, each with his assigned task, all pulling together!

Down below, we see a group of ants carrying a boulder up an incline. One worker ants slips, and the boulder rolls down, crushing his leg. The other ants rush over -- it looks like they're going to help their fallen comrade, but instead, they climb right over him, and pick up the boulder, continuing with their task.

MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR

You see? Being an ant is being able to say, "Hey -- I'm meaningless, you're meaningless."

Z

But -- but I've always felt life was about finding meaning...and then sharing it with someone special,
 
someone you love.

The motivational counsellor puts his arm on Z's shoulder...he seems to understand...

MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR

Z...you need help.
(looking at a clock)
Whoops!	We're gonna have to stop
there.	Your minute is up!

The counsellor ushers Z out of his seat and towards the door.

MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR

Now back to work!	We've made real

progress!	Remember -- let's be
best superorganism we can be!

INT. EARLY MEGA-TUNNEL - DAY

A gigantic tunnel, with the size and scale of the "Chunnel". A banner strung overhead reads: "The Mega-Tunnel -- Tunneling Our Way to a Bright Future!" Along the walls hang 50's work-incentive style posters with messages like, "You asked for it, you got it -- more work!" and "TWO MEALS A WEEK IS ENOUGH!!!" Line after line of ants is working on the tunnel, digging, passing clumps of dirt from ant to ant, everyone synchronized.

CLOSE on a clump of DIRT being passed from hand to hand.
PULL OUT TO REVEAL

AZTECA, a feisty, cynical, female worker ant, who stands there, waiting to pass the dirt on. Z is daydreaming behind her, with clumps of dirt starting to pile up in front of him.

AZTECA

Hello?! Earth to Z! You better snap out of it, or there's gonna be a lot of pissed off ants!

Z looks back, and sees the ants behind staring at him angrily.

Z

(snapping out of it)
Sorry Azteca.	Here you go, fellas!
Fresh dirt!	Alley oop!
(looking at the dirt)
Shouldn't we be wearing gloves?	I
mean this dirt is very...dirty.
Doesn't anyone think of hygiene?
(Z's stomach growls)
 

Boy am I hungry. I'm so hungry I'm seeing double. It looks like there's two million ants in here. When's lunch? Tomorrow, or the day after?

AZTECA

(sweetly)
Z, old pal...
(shouts)
SHUT UP!!!	It's bad enough there's
a food shortage without you
complaining about it every day.

Z

The squeaky wheel gets the oil.

AZTECA

No, Z. The squeaky wheel gets thrown away, alright? You're a good ant, Z, even though you are a pain in my rear-segment. I don't wanna see anything happen to you. So quit mouthing off, before you get in trouble.


A WHISTLE BLOWS.

Z

Thank goodness.	Breaktime.

All the ants put down their tools. A beat. Then the WHISTLE BLOWS AGAIN. All the ants pick up their tools again.

AZTECA

(resigned)
Break's over.

Z

(getting back to work)

This colony needs another tunnel like a hole in the ground. Why are we even digging this thing?

AZTECA

Who cares, Z.	All I know is, we
gotta dig.	We're not the ones in
charge.

INT. TOWN CENTER - DAY

The huge, spacious main chamber of the colony. Looming over the scene is the royal palace, which seems to be
 
inaccessible, perched on top of a hill-like pedestal.

Around the base of the pedestal, a crew of workers loiters, seemingly aimlessly...can these be the only unemployed ants in the place?

GENERAL FORMICA
STAIRS!

The workers look up and GROAN. Then they start forming a stairway with their own bodies, linking arms, stepping on each other's shoulders. It's extremely unpleasant work. One ant is a little tardy, and just manages to get in place before...

GENERAL FORMICA, the Pattonesque military leader of the colony, STEPS ON HIS HEAD, using it as the first step as he ascends to the palace, his aide-de-camp Carpenter in tow. As Formica mounts the "stairs" we can hear the workers going, "OUCH! OOF! YIKES!" etc.

GENERAL FORMICA

Cut the chit-chat down there!
(turning to Carpenter)
We've spoiled these workers,
Carpenter.	They've never had it so
good, and listen to them -- always
grumbling and complaining...

Formica steps on the foot of one of the "stairway" ants, who muffles a yelp.

CARPENTER

...Yes, sir.

GENERAL FORMICA

What have they got to complain about?
Three square meals a day...

CARPENTER

Actually, sir, we've cut them down to three roughly rectangular meals a week.

FORMICA

Don't give me statistics, Carpenter.
I know what I'm talking about.	DOORS!

Formica and Carpenter have reached the top of the staircase. There, the two guard ants on either side of the massive throne room doors pull them open -- and one door hinge
SQUEAKS.
 

FORMICA

(to guard ant, while
passing)
Oil that, soldier.

INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY

The QUEEN is on her throne, her huge abdomen sprawled behind her.

QUEEN

Ah!	General Formica.

Formica salutes and marches to her, Carpenter behind him.

Note: Throughout this scene, the Queen is giving birth repeatedly. Each birth is accompanied by a herald playing a short "Happy Birthday" fanfare on his trumpet. Mid-wife ants bring each baby to the Queen for inspection, who COOS a few words. The midwives put the babies on a moving bassinet-line, powered by ants on a treadmill.

QUEEN

General, the severe food shortage
that faces the colony...pains me.
The thought of any of my children
going hungry...
(she shudders; then,
to baby)

Who's the cutest widdle worker? You are! Yes, you! Don't forget to brush your teeth!

(to mid-wife)
Ship 'er out.
(back to Formica)
What steps are you taking to remedy
the situation?

FORMICA

We are launching a major offensive to
expand our foraging territory...

QUEEN

Yes, what else?

FORMICA

Please don't worry, your majesty. Leave the worrying to me. As you know, I'm not an ant of half-measures. I don't pussyfoot around. This crisis is my number one
 
priority, and I promise you it's

being dealt with swiftly, and
decisively.

The Queen's attention is interrupted by another baby being put in her arms.

QUEEN

(to baby)
No snacking between meals!	Off you
go!
(to Formica)
Now -- what were we saying?

FORMICA

(Oliver North-style)
I do not recollect, your majesty.
Will that be all?

QUEEN

Yes, General Formica. Carry on, my good man! I don't know what we would do without you.

Formica clicks his heels and bows his head. Carpenter bows low. Formica smartly about faces --

BALA (O.S.)

General Formica!

PRINCESS BALA hurries through a second doorway, carrying a swatch book. Something about her sets her apart from the HANDMAIDEN ANTS with her. Her tiara, probably.

Formica tilts his head quizzically to Carpenter behind him.

CARPENTER

(sotto)
Princess Bala, sir.	Your fiancee.

FORMICA
Princess!	You look -- outstanding.
Is there anything I can do for you?

BALA

Well -- I thought -- since we're getting married...it might be nice if we...got to know one another.

Formica looks confused.

QUEEN
 
Bala has always been a hopeless

romantic, General.

BALA

It's just that -- well, I'm honored that you selected me, and everything, I just thought the marriage might go a little more smoothly if -- we had a conversation?

FORMICA

(uncomfortable)
Conversation...yes...well...
(to Carpenter)
Wasn't she briefed?

QUEEN

(holding up a baby)
Look, General!	A darling baby
soldier!
(emotionally, to baby)
Don't try to be a hero!	Just make
sure you come back in one piece!
(handing it off)
Next!

FORMICA

(using the
interruption)
I'll take your suggestion under

advisement, Princess.	In the
meanwhile --

Formica turns to go.

BALA

General -- we have to talk sometime!

FORMICA

Very well.	Carpenter, is there a
convenient time to talk vis-a-vis:
relationship?

CARPENTER

Actually, sir, we're ahead of schedule. We have thirty-six seconds available right now.

FORMICA

Outstanding.	Princess...?

Bala's a little fazed...but grabs her chance.
 

BALA

So, um...how was your day? What did you do?

FORMICA

(scouring his mind)
Well...
(that's it!)
I declared war!

BALA

(sadly)

Oh...and I was afraid we had nothing in common...

CARPENTER

(under his breath)
Fourteen-fifty hours, sir.

FORMICA

Duty calls!

He strides across the floor. Bala watches him go, her antennae drooping unhappily.

FORMICA

No squeak.	Outstanding!

We see through the now-open doors into the throne-room as Formica and Carpenter double-time out of the frame.

The Queen sees that Bala is unhappy.

QUEEN
(sympathetically)
I felt the same way before I got
married.	Confused.	Scared.

BALA

(hopefully)
You did?

QUEEN

Yes -- but I did my duty and sorted
out all those messy feelings.	The
wonderful thing about ant life is
that everything is arranged.	Even
marriage.	You're lucky -- General
Formica is a paragon of anthood.

BALA
 
(unconvinced)

Yes...he's wonderful...

The doors swing shut on them -- revealing the two guard ants who were CRUSHED in the wake of Formica's exit.

INT. BALA'S QUARTERS - DAY

Bala enters, followed by her handmaidens, who are in a state of giggling infatuation over Formica. Bala is scowling as she leafs through a wedding catalogue.

HANDMAIDEN #1

(swooning over
General Formica)

The General's body segments are
so...symmetrical.

HANDMAIDEN #2

(giggling)
I'd let him order me into battle
anyday.

Bala hurls the swatch book against the wall.

HANDMAIDEN #1

Princess?	What's wrong?

BALA

Wrong? How could anything be wrong? I'm going to marry General Formica and be a queen and have millions of babies, just like my mom.

(concerned)
Do I look fat to you?

HANDMAIDEN #2

(knowingly, to
Handmaiden #2)
Pre-wedding jitters.

HANDMAIDEN #1

You just need to blow off some steam.
Let's go to the bar at the Royal Club!

BALA

The Club's so stuffy. I want to try someplace different.

HANDMAIDEN #2

There isn't anyplace else --
(making a joke)
 
Except the worker bar.

BALA

The worker bar!	Yes!	That's where
I want to go!

The handmaidens look shocked.

HANDMAIDEN #1

But -- we can't -- there'll be
workers there.

INT. ANT BAR - NIGHT

A long bar filled with ants. The bar itself seems to stretch for miles, and there are hundreds of ants trying to get a drink...unfortunately, there's only one bartender. Z is at the bar with WEAVER, a burly ant soldier.

Z

We declared war again?
(off Weaver's nod)
Are you scared?

WEAVER

(shrugs)
I'll be back.

The BARTENDER, a grizzled veteran, slaps down what looks like a couple of large green beer mugs. Actually, they're aphids, little green critters he fills up from a number of kegs hanging from the ceiling. The kegs are specialized ants with hugely distended stomachs, which spray liquid into the aphids.

APHIDS
(as they're slapped
on bar)
Ouch!	Ouch!

BARTENDER

Two aphid beers.

Z

(as Bartender leaves)

Did you see that? How he gave you the beers, not me? I'm telling you, he's got something against workers.

WEAVER

I don't know what you're talking
about, Z.
 
Z

Come on -- everybody dumps on us workers. You soldiers get all the glory. Plus you get to go out into the world, meet interesting insects, and kill them.

WEAVER

Yeah, but you get to spend all day
with those fabulous worker babes.

We can see that Weaver is eyeing a nearby table of "Worker Babes", including Z's friend Azteca.

Z

Weaver, they're career girls.
They're obsessed with digging.
(sighs)

No, I'll probably never meet the girl for me.

WEAVER

Who said there was a girl for you?
I was talking about a girl for me.
(quaffing his aphid
beer)
Don't you want your aphid beer?

Z
I can't help it.	I have a thing
about drinking from the anus of
another creature.	Call me crazy.

WEAVER

Z, we've known each other a long
time, right?

Z

Of course. You were born two seconds after me.

WEAVER

And all the time I've known you,
you've been grumping and groaning.
You should quit making waves.	Go
with the flow.

Z
Weaver, I'm an insect, not a liquid.

Down the bar, there's a commotion. A grizzled old SCOUT ant has had too much to drink.
 

DRUNK SCOUT

Have you been to Insectopia?	Have
you?	No, ya goddam larvas!	But I
have...
(becoming emotional)
...Mosquitos n' caterpillars n'
beetles -- all livin' in peace,
stuffin their guts with food...No
rules, no regulations...you can be
your own ant there...
(howling drunkenly)
It's Insectopia!	Insectopia!

Z

Hey, Weaver, listen!

DRUNK SCOUT

I was cut off from my unit -- found
it by mistake --
(slurring)
It changed my life!
(spraying another
soldier with saliva)

You see -- ya follow the great yellow egg, and you come to the land of red and white --

SOLDIERS
You've had enough for one night!
Come on, Gramps, before you get in
trouble.

The soldiers pull him from the bar, carrying him out.

Z

(excited)
Hey, did you hear what he said?!

WEAVER

Poor guy's had one too many scouting missions.

MUSIC STARTS UP.

INT. ANT BAR ENTRANCE - NIGHT

Princess Bala is peering in at the entrance to the ant bar, accompanied by her worried-looking handmaidens.

HANDMAIDEN #2

We shouldn't be doing this -- it
 
isn't proper!

BALA

I'm the Princess, aren't I?

HANDMAIDEN #2

Of course --

BALA

And do Princesses do improper things?

HANDMAIDEN #2

Of course not --

BALA

Then if I go to the worker bar, it isn't improper. Anyway, don't worry. No one will recognize us in our disguises.

She adjusts her "disguise", a hardhat, tied down Jackie O.-style with an ant's version of a Chanel scarf.

BALA

I'm just a common worker, cooling off after a rough day!

Music starts. An ant BARKER takes the mic at one end of the dance floor.

BARKER

(on loudspeaker)
Okay, folks.	It's six-fifteen, and
that means it's time to dance.

Every ant gets up to dance.	Weaver turns to Z.

WEAVER

(draining his beer)
Time to cut a rug, Z!

Z

I'm not in the mood.
(disgusted)
Even when they're off work, they
follow orders.

WEAVER
Well, you just sit here and be a
party-pooper.

Weaver joins the rest of the ants who are lining up for the
 

dance. The Barker calls out the steps in a bored monotone -- all the ants already know the steps. Everyone dances in perfect synch.

BARKER

(southern twang)
And a left-right-quarterstep-back
step-halfstep -- a left-right-
quarterstep-backstep-halfstep --

a	left-right-quarterstep-backstep halfstep --

AT THE ENTRANCE, Bala smiles mischievously at her handmaidens.

BALA

I'm going to ask one of these
mindless, primitive worker-types to
dance with me!

HANDMAIDEN #1

But General Formica would be furious!

BALA
(enjoying the idea)
I know.

The handmaidens are appalled. Bala whirls away from them, sets her sights and searches the crowd -- zeroing in on --

Z, who's watching the other ants dance.

Z

What a bunch of losers. Mindless zombies capitulating to an oppressive system --

BALA

Wanna dance?

Bala's standing right there.	Z is instantly smitten.

Z

Me?!	Yes!!!	I mean --
(regaining suavosity)
Just let me finish my beer.

Not breaking eye contact with Bala, Z smiles suavely. Reaches suavely for a beer. Suavely grabs the candle in a glass jar off the bar. Suavely singes his face.

He plays it off with a rakish little laugh. A bit apprehensive, Bala heads onto the floor. Z follows her.
 

Z

So uh -- how come I haven't seen you around here before?

BALA

(covering up)

I work in the palace, I don't get out much.

Z

The palace, hunh? I bet those royals really live it up. Of course they're all a little, you know, from inbreeding --

BALA

(shocked)
What?

Z and Bala step onto the dance floor with the rest of the ants, but Z can't do any of the steps.

Z

Now, let's see, I -- it's been a
while since I -- I think you --

Bala watches Z, trying to follow along. It's the blind leading the blind, as Z tries in vain to follow the barker's rapid instructions.

Z

Here, I'll lead.

Z starts doing his own, individual dance. With a suave expression on his face, he leads Bala in a helter-skelter mixture-of Tango, Charleston, and hand-jive.

BALA

Are you sure this is a real dance?

Z

Well, actually, uh -- I'm sort of
making it up --

BALA

(surprised)
Really?

Z

Why should everyone dance the same
way?	It's as exciting as watching
 
fungus grow.

BALA

You're right!

Z

(surprised)
You -- you think I'm right?

BALA
Why can't I just do whatever I want
to do?	Why can't I just go wild?!
Yahoo!

Bala starts to get into it, making up her own steps in reply to Z's, loosening up, having fun. For a moment, the two of them are actually sexy together. Then they get a little too wild -- and the other ants, who are still doing their intricate dance, start to collide with Bala and Z. Z almost knocks over a big soldier ant. We can only see the ant's back at the moment.

SOLDIER
Hey!	Watch your step, worker.

Z has turned around to see the soldier ant, MAJOR MANDIBLE, glaring at him. Mandible is about twice Z's size. He's got one eye missing, and half of his left antenna his been chewed off.

BALA

You watch yours, soldier, or my
worker friend will beat you up!

Z
(terrified)
Oh, that's okay, I'll let him off
this time.
(whispering to Bala)

Are you crazy? This guy's built like a pebble!
(ineptly trying to

placate the soldier)
You know they do great prosthetic
antennas nowadays --

BALA

Aren't you gonna stand up for
yourself?

Z's caught between a rock and a hard place. He doesn't want to get beaten up, but on the other hand, he doesn't want to
 

lose face in front of Bala. More soldiers have gathered around, looking hostile.

SOLDIER
How come you don't dance like the
rest of us?

Z glances over at Bala. Then, shaking with nervousness, he says defiantly...

Z

Because -- because I'm an individual!

SOLDIER #2

An individual?	Never heard of it.

MANDIBLE

You look like a worker to me.

WEAVER

Hey, lay off my little buddy!

Z, meanwhile, looks far away, ecstatic, as if he's just realized something very important. Unfortunately, just at this moment, A soldier pushes Weaver...Weaver pushes him back...somebody makes a dive for Z -- and before you know it, there's a regular bar brawl going on, with Weaver in the middle of it, cracking heads together, punching ants in the face, having a great time. Just then, the Princess' handmaidens hurries over.

HANDMAIDEN #1

Princess Bala!	Princess Bala!

Z, who's scrabbling around on the floor, overhears.

Z

Princess?	You're a Princess?

HANDMAIDEN #2

The police are coming!

BALA

Uh oh.
(to Z)
Goodbye!	Gotta run!

Z
Wait!	When can I see you again?

BALA

Let me think.	Hmmnn...
 
(thinks)

Never.	Bye!

Bala rushes off with her handmaiden, just before a squad of whistle-blowing POLICE wade into the crowd.

Z

Wait!	Princess!	Wait!

But she's already gone, leaving Z holding her scarf.

CUT TO:

INT. DORMITORY - THE NEXT DAY

Z is talking to Weaver, who's getting ready to go off to war.
Nearby, columns of ant soldiers march by.

WEAVER

Get real, Z!	She just dropped the
scarf by accident!

Z
Are you kidding?	There were sparks
between us!	This scarf is a sign!

WEAVER

It's a sign that you're crazy!	Do
you know what the penalty for
impersonating a soldier is?

Z

What's gonna go wrong?! I take your place for the royal inspection. Bala comes strolling down the line, she sees me -- bingo! Love is rekindled, and she takes me up to the palace for a little...

(wags his eyebrows
suggestively)

tea and crumpets... and you take your place again, and go march around to your heart's content!

Weaver looks unconvinced.

Z

You have to help me. Please, Weaver. Think of all the things I've done for you!

WEAVER
 
(thinks)

I can't think of any.

Z
(pause)

Well I'm gonna start doing things for you...

WEAVER

Will you introduce me to some worker girls?

Z

You bet!	They'll really go for a
sensitive guy like you!

WEAVER

Maybe I'll get lucky.
(Weaver thinks about
it)
You know, Z, I wouldn't do this
for anyone but you...

Weaver hands Z has helmet.

WEAVER

Wear this.

Z
(overjoyed)
You're a real buddy.

WEAVER

(sourly)
Yeah, I know.

Z

What do I do?

WEAVER

Don't tell anyone you're a worker. Follow that column over there. And come right back after the inspection!

Weaver points to a bunch of soldiers hurrying by in formation.

Z

(overjoyed)
Thanks!	I owe you!

Z skips off and joins the column, marching in time with the soldiers but too excited to keep from jazzing it up a little.
 

INT. TOWN CENTER - NIGHT

The ant army has gathered in a huge HALL in front of a reviewing stand. We can hear the murmuring of thousands of soldiers -- but all we can see is a HUGE POSTER of an ant General pointing right at the camera. The poster reads, "GENERAL FORMICA WANTS YOU -- to obey".

Z turns to some of the soldiers near him.

Z

Any of you guys know when the Princess will show up? She's kind of a personal friend.

The soldiers look at Z like he's nuts.

LOUD VOICE

ATTEN-SHUN!

MARTIAL MUSIC sounds, and we hear thousands of ant feet as they snap to attention. Z imitates the soldiers awkwardly.

GENERAL FORMICA struts to the middle 6f the screen, slapping his thigh with a swagger stick (the antenna of some unfortunate insect)

FORMICA

First of all, let me make one thing clear. Nobody ever won a battle by thinking for himself. All this "thinking" stuff is a load of crap. If the almighty had wanted you boys to think, he wouldn't have given you huge mandibles and a brain so small you'd misplace it if it wasn't trapped inside your head.

In the audience, Z starts laughing -- he thinks Formica's just made a joke.

Z

(slapping his thigh) "Trapped inside your head" -- that's a good one --

Z notices nobody else is laughing.	He stops.

Z

Geez -- tough room.
 

From the stage, Formica is squinting at the audience, trying to make out who was laughing, but there are just too many ants. He continues.

FORMICA

(striding back and
forth)

We ants survive as a species because we do what we're told. We survive because we work together, as one, we get the job done, we do whatever it takes to persevere!

(dramatic pause)
Hell, we're not an army of
ants...we're one giant ant, with

giant fists, and giant jaws!

The soldiers CHEER!	Z CHEERS along with the rest of them.

Z

(to the soldier ant
next to him)
Lays it on a little thick, doesn't
he?	If you ask me, he's one giant
bore.

FORMICA

Now I've heard a lot of scuttlebutt about a food shortage. Well you boys are gonna be taken care of. But in the meantime we're gonna eat the enemy for breakfast, we are gonna eat the enemy for lunch, and we are gonna eat the enemy for dinner!

Z

Geez, and I forgot my toothbrush.

FORMICA

(reflective moment)
Dammit, I'm proud to be an ant.
(he looks out at his

army)

And I know each and every one of you boys will do your duty. Dismissed.

Z applauds and whistles as the other ants look at him in confusion.

Z

(clapping)
Bravo!	Bring on the Princess!
 

COLONEL

Stow the gab there, soldier!	Let's
move 'em out!

The soldiers turn to the right and start to march out past the reviewing stand.

A COLONEL marches at the head of Z's column as Z looks around for the Princess.

COLONEL

Eyes...left!

Finally, as Z's part of the army marches past the end of the reviewing stand, he sees her, looking bored, standing next to the Queen, who is giving the royal wave.

Z

(waving)

Princess! Princess Bala! Hey! It's me! Z! I've got your scarf!

ON THE REVIEWING STAND, Bala sees Z -- that is to say, she sees one of the thousands upon thousands of ants marching by...

BALA

(peering out)
Who is that idiot?

QUEEN

Darling, you must encourage the
troops -- wave!

Bala waves unenthusiastically, little more than flopping her hand back and forth on her wrist.

Down below, Z takes this as a sign that Bala has seen him.

Z
(excited)
Excuse me, guys -- That's my date.
Well, it's been fun.	Have a great
war!

Z tries to squeeze his way back towards the royals, but he's surrounded by a solid wall of soldiers -- and they're carrying him along with them.

Z

Hey!	Wait!
 

Z loses sight of the Princess as he's carried away. BARBATUS, a hard-as-nails "grunt" soldier ant, taps Z on the shoulder.

BARBATUS

You new, kid?

Z

I just joined up.	But I'm quitting!
I got a trial membership!

BARBATUS

Trial membership? Kid, when you join this ant's army, you're in for the full hitch.

At that moment, Z is swept out of the cramped corridor they've been marching along, as the army emerges into the OPEN AIR outside of the colony.

EXT. ANT MOUND - NIGHT

It's a starry, moonlit night. The shadows crowd around the panicked Z, who looks up at the sky as we see the army on the march...

Z

Wait a minute, there's been a mistake! I've got to get back to the colony!

Z starts to fall out of line, but Barbatus, looking concerned, stops him.

BARBATUS

Are you crazy, kid?	They shoot
deserters!

Z swallows hard.

BARBATUS

You just stick by old Barbatus.
He'll watch out for you.
(off Z's look)
Whatsamatter, kid?	Leave a girl
behind?

Z

Yeah. Well -- no. She's kind of playing hard to get. As a matter of fact, she's playing completely
 
unattainable.

(nervously)

So, what's on the schedule? A brisk walk? a foraging expedition?

BARBATUS

No -- we're going to attack the
termites!

Z
(alarmed)
Attack?	But -- I hate attacking!
It's so hostile!

Around Z and Barbatus, the ants start up a marching song, which we intersperse with dialogue between Barbatus and Z to form a montage/time-cut as the ant army marches on to the termite capital.

ANT SOLDIERS

(to the tune of "When
Johnny Comes
Marching Home")
We ants go marching one by
one, hurrah, hurrah!	We slaughter
termites just for fun, Hurrah!
Hurrah!

Z

So -- these termites, they're little, shy, retiring insects?

BARBATUS

(grim smile)

No such luck. Those dirty terms are five times bigger than us, and they shoot acid from their foreheads!

SOLDIER ANTS

We ants go marching two by two, hurrah! Hurrah! We'll all be dead before we're through, hurrah! Hurrah!

Montage shots of an ant column marching diagonally across the screen, fading into another column marching diagonally downwards across the screen...

Z
Well, what exactly does our platoon
do?	Serve beverages?	Process
paperwork?
 
BARBATUS

Our platoon has the best assignment of all. We're the first into battle!

ANT SOLDIERS

We ants are marching three by three, hurrah! Hurrah! Dead ants is what we soon will be, hurrah! Hurrah!

...montage shot of Z's column crossing a bridge composed of living ants -- all of whom look extremely uncomfortable as they're getting stepped on...

Z

So we're going back for more armor,

right?	I mean, these guys are from
outer space, how are we supposed to
beat them?!

BARBATUS

Superior numbers, kid!

EXT. TERRAIN NEAR TERMITE STUMP - NIGHT

Z looks up to see...looming high above them...the TERMITE CITY, which is built in the stump of a dead tree. From here it looks like a demonic Mount Fuji. The COLONEL ANT shouts an order.

COLONEL
ATTAAAAAAAAACK!!!

The front line of ants starts rushing towards the termite colony...Z is swept along...

BARBATUS

Over the TOOOOOOOOOOOOO-OP!!!

Z is swept along and up the side of the stump as thousands of
ants invade the colony through every possible entrance.
Up...over the lip of the stump...and down inside, to the very
middle of the termite colony...

Into a disquietingly peaceful scene. They're in the middle of the hollowed-out trunk, and ants keep pouring in -- but there's not a termite to be seen. Barbatus looks around suspiciously.

BARBATUS

It's too damn quiet.

Then we hear a strange tapping noise.	Barbatus looks over,
 
and sees that Z's teeth are chattering with fear.

BARBATUS

Don't be scared, kid.	Barbatus's
got yer back.

Z

(petrified)

Maybe they went out for the evening. Let's leave them a message and head home.

COLONEL

(ignoring him)
Light it up!

A nearby soldier ant take a firefly out of his knapsack and pinches him. The firefly, yelling "Yipe! Yipe! Yipe!", shoots into the air like a flare, lighting up the interior of the stump with eery, shifting luminescence.

Then we notice, hollowed into the inside of the stump like innumerable pockmarks, termite holes staring out upon the stump...and, with an unearthly ROAR, we see the first of hundreds of termites emerging to pour into the center of the tree, right onto the ant army.

COLONEL

They're here!!!

BARBATUS

(to Z)
Keep your head down!

Within moments, Z finds himself in the middle of a BLOODBATH. The ants have broken into the colony, but are taking heavy losses from the gigantic, blind, acid-spewing termites. The battle scene is as sprawling and chaotic as something out of Braveheart. In a few QUICK SHOTS from Z's perspective, we see:

--	A squad of ants rushes towards a termite soldier, but are literally melted into smoking heaps of flesh by a jet of acid from its forehead...

--	A termite warrior is overwhelmed by a crowd of ants and is pulled to pieces with hideous ripping sounds...

--	Another termite warrior takes on an ant soldier one on one and slowly crushes his head in his huge jaws...

Z
 
(looking around)

Guys!	Guys!	It isn't too late for
all of us to just talk this over!

Just then, a termite burst up from the ground and turns to face Z. Z is dwarfed by this hulking, roaring, drooling monstrosity.

Z

Wait! Please! Acid makes me come out in spots! -- Could I just say I have always had the greatest respect for your species? I mean, eating wood -- why didn't I think of that?

I --

The termite rears, getting ready to melt Z, when OOF! he's knocked backwards by...

Z

BARBATUS!	You -- you saved my life!

BARBATUS
Don't get all sappy about it!

As Barbatus and some other soldiers kill the termite, the Colonel strides up to Z, puffing on a cigar.

COLONEL
I love the smell of formic acid in
the morning.

Z

Look out!

A stream of termite acid engulfs the colonel, instantly burning him to a cinder clutching a still-burning cigar; Z's paratroop buddies turn in terror to see a herd of termites rumbling towards them. Z, terrified, dives into the hole that the huge termite made...

INT. TERMITE TUNNEL - NIGHT

...and tumbles headlong into a corridor of the termite mound. The corridors here are primitive, caveman-like, pocked with jagged access holes.

No sooner has Z landed in the tunnel than a termite comes burrowing out from one of the side walls, snapping at Z's head. Z just avoids getting decapitated, and digs straight through the wall in order to escape...
 
INT. TERMITE QUEEN'S CHAMBER - NIGHT

...straight into the hub of the entire termite complex -- the Queen's chamber. This is nothing like the civilized court of the ant colony -- it's a huge, stinking, fetid dungeon whose walls are held up by one massive (to Z) column of piled stones.

The termite queen, a repulsive, slimy, squirming, foot-long monster, is attended by a crew of diminutive, blind termite nurses. The queen turns to look Z right in the eye.

Z

Excuse me. I seem to be lost, and I was wondering if you could give me --

Before Z can say, "directions", the queen gives out a piercing, blood-curdling shriek. The nurses start shrieking too.

Z

(backing away)
I'll let myself out.

But the queen's shriek has summoned a soldier termite -- the biggest one we've seen yet -- who is charging headlong at Z, jaws snapping open and shut like huge scissors.

Z
(backing away)
Shoo! -- Torro!	Torro!

At the last moment, Z jumps out of the way -- and the termite runs headfirst into the supporting column of the chamber. As if on a spring release, the termite's jaws clamp shut -- and shatter the base of the column. The walls of the room begin to rumble...

The termite turns to eat Z...but is crushed by a stone falling from the ceiling, which gives a final shudder and collapses, raining earth and stones down on the queen.

As the walls of the chamber crumble, melees of ants and termites pour into the room from the corridors around and above...they keep struggling until...

ANT OFFICER

(points at Z)
He's killed their Queen!

Z

Hey, I'm sorry, it was a mistake --
 

ANT OFFICER
VICTORY!!!

We can see that the termite warriors, deprived of their leader, are suddenly confused and directionless, easy prey for the ants.

Z

(facetious)

This is terrific! Let's exact crippling war reparations! Let's set up a puppet government!

ANT OFFICER

Let's slaughter them all!

The ants set about killing the disoriented termites when...we hear another rumble coming from the outside...the ants look up confusedly...

...And a (from the ant's point of view) five-hundred foot long tongue bursts through the top of the chamber with a CRASH. The ten or so ants standing directly below are smashed by the tongue, which squirts out a spray of saliva around the crater. As quick as it appeared, the tongue retracts, with a hideous SLUUURPING sound. We can now see the end of the snout of an ant-eater poking through a hole in the ceiling high above...
