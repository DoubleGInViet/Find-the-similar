INT. MEDICAL OFFICE AT UCLA - DAY
DAVID SHEFF - in his 40’s and still a great looking guy - is seated with DR. BROWN (62), a passionate amiable man.
We stay close on David.
DR BROWN (O.S.)
So this is for The New York Times
Magazine?
DAVID
No. I’m sorry...  I freelance, I
write for different magazines but
this is a personal matter.
DR BROWN (O.S.)
A personal matter?
DAVID
Yes. I’m sorry, is that okay?
DR BROWN (O.S.)
That’s absolutely okay. May I ask
what this is regarding?
DAVID
It’s about my son.
DR BROWN (O.S.)
Okay how can I help?
DAVID
There are moments that I look at him, this kid that I raised who I thought that I knew inside and out, and I wonder who he is? He’s been doing all sorts of drugs, but he’s addicted to crystal meth, which seems to be the worst of all of them. And I guess I am here because I just want to know all that I can about all of it. Know your enemies right? So...  my two big questions are, what is it doing to him and what can I do to help him?
FADE TO BLACK.
TEXT ON SCREEN: one year earlier
FADE IN:
2.
INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY, SHEFF HOUSE - NIGHT
David is walking in the hallway and peeks inside his son NIC’s (18) room. The bed is made, Nic is not there. David turns off the light and closes the door.
INT. BEDROOM, SHEFF HOUSE - NIGHT
David can’t sleep. He looks at the clock, it’s 1 am. Silently he gets out of bed to not wake his wife.
INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY, SHEFF HOUSE - NIGHT
Restless, David walks downstairs.
EXT. SHEFF HOUSE - NIGHT
From the surrounding woods, we see a light on the first floor turn on.
INT. DAVID'S STUDY, SHEFF HOUSE - DAY
David is on the phone in his workspace. It’s ringing.
HOSPITAL FRONT DESK (O.S.) Marin General Hospital, how may I help you?
David’s study is the kind of space you’d love to live a creative life. David is a senior writer for Rolling Stone, Playboy, Wired, Vanity Fair. On the walls, artwork mixed with family photos - Nic at various ages - mixed with framed magazine covers, including David’s own holy grail, the Playboy-cover featuring John Lennon’s final interview from 1980.
DAVID
Hi, my son went missing and I
wanted to check if he was maybe
brought in. Maybe an accident
happened or... 
HOSPITAL FRONT DESK (O.S.) Can I have name and a description, sir?
DAVID
Nicholas Sheff. S-H-E-F-F. He‘s 18 years old, just over six feet tall. About 130 pounds.
(MORE)
3.
DAVID (CONT'D)
Maybe less, I’m not sure. He has
shoulder length brown hair and
green eyes.
HOSPITAL FRONT DESK (O.S.)
Thank you, please hold.
DAVID
Okay.
As he waits it is excruciating. He looks around the room. At the old photos of Nic. It takes forever.
HOSPITAL FRONT DESK (O.S.)
Mr. Sheff?
DAVID
Yes.
HOSPITAL FRONT DESK (O.S.)
There is no one by that name, sir.
DAVID
Okay. Thank you.
David hangs up.
INT. NIC’S BEDROOM, SHEFF HOUSE - NIGHT
David enters Nic’s room. Turns on the light. What is he looking for? He doesn’t really know.
A little nervous he goes through some stuff, opens the drawers and checks them.
He sits at Nic’s desk and studies his drawings and writing tacked to the wall.
On Nic’s desk he sees a couple of books. He takes one, ‘The Beautiful And The Damned’, by Fitzgerald. He takes the book and flips it open at some random places, reads snippets here and there.
EXT. BACK YARD, SHEFF HOUSE - DAY
David is walking around with his phone in the garden.
DAVID
He... 
(a beat)
He’s been gone for two days.
4.
He is speaking to VICKI, Nic’s mom.
They separated a long time ago, and Vicki is always a little uneasy when confronted with David.
VICKI (O.S.)
What?! What do you mean, he’s gone?
What’s going on?
DAVID
Well, I don’t know.
VICKI (O.S.)
Two days? Why didn’t you tell me
sooner?
DAVID
I didn’t want to worry you I guess.
I just--
VICKI (O.S.)
I’m his mother, David.
(a beat)
Didn’t you see this coming?
DAVID
Uh, no.
VICKI (O.S.)
What?
DAVID
(a little upset)
No. I didn’t see it coming.
(even more)
If I had seen it coming I would
have done something.
VICKI (O.S.)
It was just a question David. You, know I haven’t been talking a lot with him lately.
In a split-second this conversation has turned into a fight, as many times before, probably.
DAVID
Well, maybe that’s why you shouldn’t be giving me advice on parenting, right? Fuck, Vicki. Could we just not blame each other right now? Thanks.
5.
VICKI
Who’s blaming who here? If I hardly ever see him, it’s because he’s supposed to come to LA for the holidays, but always finds a reason not to come.
DAVID
Well that’s not my fault, is it?
They both hang up.
David watches his wife KAREN through the windows of her studio. She is the mother of their 2 younger kids, JASPER (7) and DAISY (5), and the stepmother of Nic. Together they also have two dogs, BRUTUS and MOONDOG.
She is a beautiful and artistic woman, self assured and a little neurotic at the same time. She’s wearing a colorful paint stained overall.
Karen notices David, they look at each other. Karen stops painting and walks to David. They hug.
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY (FLASHBACK)
A younger David hands Nic (12) little wrapped-in- BABY JASPER. Nic stares at his little brother. A younger Karen watches Nic and Jasper.
DAVID
Nic. Here’s your brother.
NIC
Hi Jasper. This is amazing, dad.
Nic touches Jasper’s little hands. Karen and David watch them.
CUT TO:
David takes his jacket. He and Nic have to go. Karen and Nic hug and say goodbye.
KAREN
Bye mister. I’ll miss you this
summer. Write me.
NIC
Write me back.
KAREN
And work on your french.
6.
NIC
Oui madame.
A little laugh.
INT. DEPARTURES, SF AIRPORT - DAY (FLASHBACK CONTINUED)
David and Nic are in the departures hall, among other MINORS that will fly unaccompanied and their PARENTS, dropping them off. The minors are wearing pink paper badges with names written in Magic Marker. A couple of FLIGHT ATTENDANTS usher the kids to board the plane.
DAVID
Have a great summer. Say hi to your
Mom.
David is a little nervous. He kisses Nic on the forehead.
They hug.
DAVID (CONT’D)
Everything.
NIC
Everything.
CUT TO:
David watches through the glass, as the plane pulls back. He looks sadder than before. (he was putting on a show for Nic)
The plane takes off. David walks away.
I/E. FAMILY CAR / ROADS TO INVERNESS/ DRIVEWAY, SHEFF HOUSE - DAY
Present time.
David is driving the family car, the kids are in the back.
David watches them being goofy but his mind is somewhere else.
They come home, David sees a Volvo parked on the driveway.
He parks behind it, gets out and takes a closer look at the Volvo. Nobody in the car. The front headlight is cracked.
Daisy and Jasper get out of the car too, but don’t notice the car being home as something special.
They enter the house.
7.
INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY, SHEFF HOUSE - DAY
David approaches Nic’s bedroom door. It’s closed. He opens it.
INT. NIC’S BEDROOM, SHEFF HOUSE - DAY
David sees Nic curled up in his bed. A moment of relief. He watches him, goes nearby, sits down next to him. Nic looks pretty bad. He’s shivering.
DAVID
Hey. Where have you been?
Nic opens his eyes.
NIC
I just need to sleep.
DAVID
What have you been doing?
NIC
I just need to sleep, alright?
Leave me alone.
David notices Jasper and Daisy standing in the door and watching. They see Nic who looks really wasted.
DAVID
Guys, could you go downstairs? I’ll be there in a minute.
They hesitate a little, want to see what is going on.
DAVID (CONT’D)
Please.
They back off. David looks at Nic again, his eyes are closed again. Nic is calmer now.
David looks at him for a moment... 
I/E. VOLVO / INVERNESS ROADS - DAY
A tiny Volvo in a wide landscape. The car drives towards us.
David is driving.
Nic feels sick. David pulls over. We stay close on David.
From outside the car we hear the sounds of throwing up.
8.
Nic reenters the car. David gently rubs his back.
INT. VOLVO / GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE - DAY
David and Nic are driving. Nic watches the road and the clouds. He still feels sick. They cross the Golden Gate bridge.
INT. VOLVO / ENTERING SAN FRANCISCO - DAY
David and Nic enter San Francisco, they drive up a typical steep hill.
I/E. VOLVO / OHLHOFF REHAB - DAY
They arrive at a driveway to the rehab centre. David parks.
NIC
Dad I’m sorry. I fucked up and it was a mistake but it was a one time mistake. I learned my lesson. I don’t want to go through this shit again.
David looks at Nic, feels for him.
DAVID
Let’s just go inside.
NIC
No.
DAVID
They are professionals. Let’s just listen to what they have to say.
In a split-second Nic just changes and becomes angry and aggressive. He screams out of frustration.
NIC
Look I’m 18! You can’t force me.
David is taken aback. Nic’s right, he no longer has a legal right to force Nic into rehab.
DAVID
This got out of hand, right? Don’t you think? Come on.
NIC
Okay. I’m doing it for you.
9.
He looks at David one more time and exits the car.
EXT. OHLHOFF REHAB - DAY
They walk towards the building. SOME GUYS - presumable addicts or ex-addicts - are smoking on the stairs leading to the entrance. Nic looks at them. They look back.
INT. WAITING ROOM, OHLHOFF REHAB - DAY
Nic sits in an austere waiting room.
INT. ADMISSIONS OFFICE, OHLHOFF REHAB - DAY
David is seated with the DIRECTOR of the program, an imposing woman.
DIRECTOR
He needs treatment and fast. There are still a lot of drugs in his system and worst of all, he is in denial.
David is watching Nic through the glass of the door.
DAVID
Can you help him?
DIRECTOR
Oh yeah. A lot of the people here
are not here by choice and they
have just as much a chance as
anybody.
DAVID
OK.
Although all of this is alarming, David stays cool. ‘We will fix this’.
DIRECTOR
We have one free bed, so if you want I can check him in for our 28 day treatment. Then we evaluate.
DAVID
Um. What is your success rate?
DIRECTOR
On the high end, 80 percent. On the low end 25 percent?
10.
David nods.
DIRECTOR (CONT’D)
Look, he will have daily
consultations with staff physicians
and a psychiatrist. We have daily
AA	and NA meetings. He’ll be monitored very closely, ok?
David thinks, nods.
CUT TO:
Papers need to be filled in / Social security numbers / Credit card information / Nic enters, he needs to sign too.
CUT TO:
David takes Nic in his arms, looks him straight in the eyes:
DAVID
Everything.
Clearly some reference loaded with history - though we don’t know what it means.
Nic looks at David. A little grumpy, ashamed too.
NIC
Everything.
Nic looks away, and walks off with a NURSE. The director and David watch them walk away.
INT. DINING ROOM, OHLHOFF REHAB - MORNING
Nic, in PJ’s, looking really bad and down, steps into the rehab dining room and kitchen. 15 or so other Ohlhoff CLIENTS are serving themselves breakfast. All kinds of different people. Men, boys, women, girls. Some look as down as Nic, others are pretty up. It’s a mixed atmosphere.
Nic sits at a table and pours himself a glass of orange juice. He takes a sip and looks up at the man eating next to him, JOHNNY, 40-ish, who has lost most of his teeth.
Nic studies him and then looks back down.
DAVID (PRE-LAP)
Why are you always in this room?
You hardly ever come out of here.
It’s like you’re a vampire.
11.
INT. NIC’S BEDROOM, SHEFF HOUSE - DAY (FLASHBACK)
Nic is on the floor writing in his notebook.
NIC
I read. I draw.
David is standing at Nic’s desk.
DAVID
You know what we should do? We
should go surfing.
Nic looks up from his notebook and smiles at David.
NIC
Yeah?
DAVID
Does that sound good?
NIC
Yeah, well. I’m into other things
now.
DAVID
Reading misanthropes and seriously depressed writers... 
NIC
Ah, cmon. They’re kinda great
though, right?
David smiles, he is reminded of his own young years.
DAVID
I get it. It’ll pass, though.
Silence.
DAVID (CONT’D)
It always does.
Nic looks back down at his notebook.
NIC
What does?
DAVID
The feeling of being alienated and isolated.
Nic chuckles.
12.
NIC
That really helps. Thanks for the
advice.
David understands Nic wants to be alone.
DAVID
OK.
He exits Nic’s room.
NIC
Sorry, dad, that was stupid. It
came out wrong, I’m sorry.
A little smile. He closes the door.
INT. OFFICE, OHLHOFF - DAY
Present time.
David and Karen sit with the director.
The door opens. VINCE - one of the Ohlhoff counselors - and Nic enter. He looks a little better.
DAVID
Hey.
NIC
Hi dad.
David and Karen stand up and hug Nic. It’s a little awkward. Vince takes some chairs, they all have a seat. Vince starts talking to break the ice.
VINCE
So, we feel he’s made great
progress. Right Nic?
NIC
Yes.
DAVID
That’s great.
KAREN
That’s great, Nic.
David pats Nic on the shoulder and leaves his hand there.
13.
VINCE
So we should maybe talk about the
coming weeks. Nic?
NIC
Yes.
David is surprised: where is this leading to? Nic takes a moment, then turns to David and Karen.
NIC (CONT’D)
I think I need a little bit more time in rehab. So if it was alright with you guys I was wondering if I could stay in the halfway house here.
David and Karen look to Vince.
VINCE
The halfway house is an open living facility, with follow-up every night. And we would help him find a job.
A beat. David is trying to figure out what this means...  He looks at Nic.
NIC
I don’t want to go to college right now, dad.
David didn’t see this one coming, doesn’t understand. Takes his time to let it sink in.
DAVID
Oh. OK. And do what?
NIC
(takes his time, soft)
I think I need to be independent.
Dad, I’m telling you this is... 
it’s going to be good.
David doesn’t know what to say. A long silence.
INT. VOLVO - DAY
David is angry. He and Karen sit in the front.
DAVID
What is he gonna do? Make coffees
the rest of his life?
14.
Outside a strong wind plays with the branches of the trees aligning the street.
KAREN
Frederic told me they have friends that have a son who did a 4 week program, but it wasn’t enough. He’s doing a year program now.
David thinks about it...  Knows she’s right, but can’t admit it.
DAVID
(stung)
I wish you wouldn’t talk to
everybody about it.
KAREN
What’s that got to do with it?
DAVID
To protect Nic you know. At some point he’s gonna want to get on with his life, and maybe it’s best that not everybody knows about this.
Karen thinks about it, OK, point taken.
KAREN
OK.
But can we not make this about me?
(back to the issue at
hand)
Look, Nic needs some more time. And that’s fine. OK?
David nods.
DAVID
OK.
KAREN
OK?
DAVID
Yeah. OK.
He takes her hand. A beat. She lays her hand on his hand.
15.
EXT. BACK YARD, SHEFF HOUSE - DAY
In the backyard Karen is body painting Daisy as an Indian. Jasper is running around in red socks and red underpants and already bodypainted as SPIDERMAN.
INT. KITCHEN, SHEFF HOUSE - DAY
David is preparing food. The phone rings, and immediately the dogs start barking very loud. David, a bit annoyed, looks around but cannot find the portable phone, so it keeps on ringing, and the dogs keep on barking. Finally he finds the phone and answers.
DAVID
David Sheff.
One last bark by Moondog.
DAVID (CONT’D)
Shhht.
DIRECTOR (O.S.)
Hi Mr. Sheff. This is Annie
Goldblum from the Ohlhoff Center.
DAVID
Oh, yes. Hi, hello.
DIRECTOR (O.S.)
I’m sorry to disturb you, but I
need to inform you about Nic.
DAVID
OK?
DIRECTOR (O.S.)
He left the facility today, during some free time, and he has not returned since.
DAVID
Oh no.
DIRECTOR (O.S.)
I’m sorry Mr. Sheff. But please
don’t despair, this happens.
DAVID
But, I thought you said he was
doing so well?
16.
DIRECTOR (O.S.)
You should think of this as part of the process. Relapse is a part of recovery.
DAVID
Relapse is part of recovery?
DIRECTOR (O.S.)
It’s part of Nic’s learning
process.
DAVID
That’s...  that’s like saying crashing is part of pilot training.
DIRECTOR (O.S.)
Look, he’ll be back. Probably
really quick.
DAVID
Is somebody out looking for him?
DIRECTOR (O.S.)
It’s not our responsibility once he leaves the facility. But he’s welcome to come back.
Of course. David hangs up angry. He watches the rest of his family outside for a while, who are still oblivious.
CUT TO:
I/E. VOLVO / PARKING AND ALLEYWAYS, SAN RAFAEL - DAY
David is driving through San Rafael. The rain is pouring down. David has opened his window and is looking left and right, then turns and drives up on a parking lot... 
INTERCUT WITH:
E/I. ROADS NEAR THE OCEAN/ VOLVO - DAY (FLASHBACK)
Younger David is driving with younger Nic.
The intro to “Territorial Pissings” by Nirvana is playing:
very wild drums, very wild guitar.
Nic knows it by heart and shouts along.
KURT COBAIN + NIC
When I was an alien...  !!!
17.
David watches Nic, it’s funny.
Nic continues to head-bang and scream along with the song. It’s really wild. David is having fun, Nic too...  (although he’s screaming along so wild, it becomes a little scary).
E/I. MIDDLE SCHOOL / VOLVO - DAY (FLASHBACK CONT’D)
The song continues over young people exiting middle school.
David is waiting near his Volvo for Nic. Surfboards in the back of the car. David spots Nic. 12-year-old Nic looks like a typical nineties teen: grungy, a Primus T-shirt that is way too big, long hair covering his eyes, some pimples.
Nic stands out, because the guys who are walking next to him all seem just a little older, they all have short hair, everybody is dressed the same.
BACK TO:
I/E. VOLVO / PARKING AND ALLEYWAYS, SAN RAFAEL - DAY
David pulls up to a KITCHEN HELP smoking outside at the back door of a restaurant under an umbrella. The music softens.
DAVID
Excuse me, have you seen a kid
hanging around here?
The guy shakes his head.
DAVID (CONT’D)
No? OK. Thank you.
David closes his window. He can’t see a lot because of the rain. He drives towards an alley.
CUT TO:
E/I. MIDDLE SCHOOL / VOLVO - DAY (FLASHBACK CONT’D)
Nic and David walk through the parking lot. Nirvana now blaring, drowning out their conversation so we can’t hear.
DAVID
Hey...  how ‘d it go?
NIC
OK, I guess.
18.
DAVID
Yeah? Tell me.
NIC
Well, just different compared to San Francisco. The kids there were more into drawing and art and reading and stuff. It’s not really cool here to be smart. But that’s ok. I’ll just get worse grades.
David laughs as they get into the car.
BACK TO:
I/E. VOLVO / PARKING AND ALLEYWAYS, SAN RAFAEL - DAY
David looks left and right, then slows down as he sees a shape appear.
It’s Nic. He’s in jeans and T-shirt and is soaking wet. He looks bad, has bruises on his face.
David walks over to Nic and when he reaches him, Nic almost goes limp in David’s arms. He half carries him, opens the passenger door, drops him in the seat, closes the door.
David gets in at the other side, looks at Nic for a moment - he’s shivering, almost passed out. What to do, what to say?
Nic turns and vomits, soiling himself and the seat.
The music STOPS.
CUT TO:
INT. CAR/ GROCERY STORE - DAY (FLASHBACK)
David and late teen’s Nic just got some groceries in the local grocery store. The atmosphere is good, Nic’s talking freely, David is enjoying. David is about to start the car, and reverse... 
NIC
Hey dad, do you want to smoke this?
Nic takes out a joint.
DAVID
Hey! Woah, wait. What? Stop.
David nervously laughs.
19.
DAVID (CONT’D)
Put that away.
NIC
I think we should smoke this
together.
Nic keeps eyeing David.
DAVID
This is crazy. No.
NIC
I know you smoke.
DAVID
Yeah...  No, no... 
NIC
You know what? You’re right, I’ll
just light it here alone.
Nic doesn’t get a yes or a no, as David is too surprised, so Nic puts it to his lips and takes out a lighter.
DAVID
Don’t! Stop it. Occasionally from
time to time I will have a hit or
two at a party but it has been
awhile... 
NIC
Just have a celebratory joint with your son.
They laugh and David starts the car, backs up.
DAVID
Oh, god. Come on.
EXT. ROAD LEADING TO POINT REYES LIGHTHOUSE - DAY (FLASHBACK CONTINUED)
The car is parked at a road with a spectacular view over the ocean and magnificent windswept trees. They sit on the hood of the car. Sunset. Nic takes a hit from the joint... 
DAVID
You’re amazing, Nic. You applied to 6 colleges and were accepted to all of them! Stop doubting yourself? Look at you. Gimme that.
20.
Passes it to David. He takes a couple of hits. Nic laughs.
DAVID (CONT’D)
What?
NIC
That was a nice hit.
David exhales and they laugh together. He hands the joint back to Nic.
NIC (CONT’D)
Thank you, this is nice...  thing to do.
(intrigued, asking
something he never asked
before)
You did a lot of drugs, right?
DAVID
I did my share. Sure. I experimented with different kinds of drugs. And had fun sometimes. I did.
David chuckles.
DAVID (CONT’D)
But not harmless, I had a friend
that... 
NIC
Is this the lecture part?
It makes David smile.
NIC (CONT’D)
You worry too much. Everyone does
it.
DAVID
Yeah, well...  Just be careful.
NIC
It's just pot. It's just once in a while. I'm just partying a little. I worked hard this year...  I deserve to party a little now.
Nic is laughing, a bit stoned. David watches Nic with a smile. He’s also a bit stoned, we notice now.
DAVID
Deserve to party... 
21.
Nic takes a last hit of the joint, throws the butt away.
NIC
It just takes the edge off things, you know. Of stupid all day reality.
David thinks about this. All of a sudden changes his attitude. Instead of the pot-smoking buddy, he’s the worrying father again (but also, slightly stoned).
DAVID
What is stupid about reality?
Nic looks at David, wants to argue... 
NIC
Well you know, like daily stupid
things, that don’t matter... 
DAVID
Come on Nic, you cannot say dumb
shit like that or you’ll start
believing it.
INT. DAVID'S STUDY, SHEFF HOUSE - DAY
Back to present time.
David is at his computer. He’s pulling up websites, gathering information, writing.
On the screen: “Crystal meth - is a very addictive stimulant drug... ”
Another website: “Meth can make a person’s mood change quickly. For example, someone using meth might become angry and violent.”
David stops writing. He stares at the computer. He looks exhausted.
INT. NIC’S BEDROOM, ST. CELINE REHAB - DAY
Nic enters his bedroom followed by David and Karen. It’s a simple, clean, white room with twin single beds and night-stands. David and Karen look around. Nic puts down a pile of folded clothes in a laundry bag.
NIC
Thanks for bringing this, Karen.
22.
Nic puts up his arms.
NIC (CONT’D)
This is my home.
David looks at Nic, then looks out of the window, vineyard view. Karen notices an ‘Alcoholics Anonymous Big Book’ on Nic’s bedside table.
CUT TO:
David and Nic sit on the beds and face each other. David watches Nic for a moment.
DAVID
A couple of weeks ago you told me that you had only done crystal meth once but the story has to be bigger than that, right?
Nic nods.
DAVID (CONT’D)
There’s more to it?
David’s mood changes.
DAVID (CONT’D)
(firm)
Yeah?
KAREN
David.
DAVID
We need to know.
A beat. Nic is thinking, where to start?
NIC
I think I always liked it.
DAVID
What?
NIC
Anything.
Karen takes a seat next to Nic on the bed. He’s opening up.
NIC (CONT’D)
Pot. Alcohol. Ecstasy. Cocaine.
LSD.
23.
A beat.
DAVID
And you’ve been doing all that, for what, years?
NIC
A couple of years, yeah.
DAVID
And crystal meth?
NIC
Just a couple months.
DAVID
But why?
NIC
I don’t know...  When I tried it, I felt, I felt better than I ever had...  So I kept on doing it.
DAVID
I was worried that you were smoking too much pot meanwhile you’re out doing every drug on the planet?
Nic doesn’t know what to answer. David is coming a little too strong at him. David goes on.
DAVID (CONT’D)
And hiding it and lying. And why?
Tell me.
NIC
I don’t know.
DAVID
Why? Tell me why!
KAREN
Ease up.
NIC
I don’t know!
Nic starts crying. Karen is comforting Nic.
DAVID
I thought we were close. Closer
than most fathers and sons.
Nic tries to defend himself... 
24.
NIC
I feel like you’re just always disappointed in me. You’re disappointed I don’t go to college, you’re... 
... but this makes David really angry.
DAVID
Well can you blame me? Not too long ago you were reading and you were writing and you were on the waterpolo team. And look at us now! This isn’t us. This is not who we are!
KAREN
Guys, please stop this. Dave, calm down! Stop it.
Nic starts sobbing.
David does calm down. He takes a moment to reset himself.
Silence.
NIC
Dad, I’m really sorry about
everything.
Another silence.
NIC (CONT’D)
I’m really sorry, dad.
DAVID
Nic, what you have you are going to find it again. You’re going to get it back.
Nic looks up. They look at each other. David takes Nic half in his arms. Nic lets it happen. Karen takes Nic’s hand, strokes it.
EXT. BACK YARD, SHEFF HOUSE - DAY
David sits in the yard playing catch with the dogs but his mind is clearly somewhere else.
EXT. REMOTE BEACH - LATE AFTERNOON (FLASHBACK)
David and Nic paddle out into the ocean with surfboards into a pretty wild ocean. It’s a bit foggy.
25.
In the distance we see rocks and big cliffs.
Nic paddles away as David gets hit by a big wave. David struggles to get back onto his board and starts paddling as fast as he can, but gets hit by another big wave. He gets thrown towards the beach.
A bit out of breath, David stands up and grabs his board. He watches over the ocean. We see his POV: big breaking waves, no Nic. David panics a little. He looks left and right.
DAVID
Nic? Nic?!
In the distance we see a surfboard? Or something? A wave crashes onto it. David steps further into the ocean, knee-deep, waist-deep, holding his surfboard, challenging big walls of whitewater coming in. More panic.
David starts paddling again. Again paddling hard, fighting against the waves coming in.
DAVID (CONT’D)
Fuck.
Finally he paddles and gets behind the point where the wave breaks. He sighs. Looks around again, still breathing hard. Meanwhile it’s darker, and there’s more fog. He pushes himself up his board to try and spot Nic again.
And all of a sudden there is Nic, standing atop a wave, and carving up and down. Coming into David’s direction and hooting for joy.
NIC
Woo-hoo!
David watches Nic. Wow, he looks amazing.
INT. DINING ROOM, OHLHOFF REHAB - NIGHT
Back to the present.
Nic on his cell phone.
NIC
Hey dad. How’s New York?
DAVID (O.S.)
Fine. Good interview today. How are you?
26.
NIC
Oh I’m doing good.
Nic fidgets with a glass of water.
CUT TO:
INT. AMBASSADOR HOTEL - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
David is sitting in a fancy hotel room on the other end of the phone.
DAVID
Yeah? You sure?
David stands. He paces.
NIC (O.S.)
Yes I am.. It’s just...  Uhm... 
DAVID
What’s going on?
David becomes a little nervous. He stares through the large window overlooking the NY skyline.
NIC (O.S.)
We had this great group session and one of the guys here was saying he would do anything for a chance to go to college but he can’t.
DAVID
OK.
NIC
And we were talking later and he
said you can still go to college.
Don’t be an idiot. Go to college.
David walks up to the window.
INTERCUT BETWEEN DAVID AND NIC FROM HERE ON
NIC (CONT’D)
I don’t know. It’s just crazy. I
realized I don’t think I should
stay behind. I love writing and I
feel like I’m good at it and I do
it a lot but obviously there’s
still a lot for me to learn.
David smiles.
27.
NIC (CONT’D)
Anyway, I would love to give it a
go...  if it’s alright with you
guys.
A beat. We see David’s excitement reflected in the window, which he doesn’t express audibly to Nic.
DAVID
Yeah. I’ll talk to Karen. And to
your mom.
INT. PLANE - DAY
Nic takes a seat in a crowded plane. David stands in the aisle, looks at his boarding pass.
DAVID
Oh, I’m further down. I’ll ask to
switch.
A STEWARD comes by in a rush, closing the overhead bins.
NIC
I’ll be fine.
David walks further and takes his seat. Nic waves and smiles.
David smiles back and settles in his seat.
Between the seats he sees Nic, he watches him for a while, he looks way better. Nic is talking enthusiastically to the person next to him.
INT. NIC’S BEDROOM, EAST HAMPSHIRE COLLEGE - DAY
Nic is getting settled in his room, unpacking. In the HALLWAY we sense other FRESHMEN KIDS and their FAMILIES. David sits at a desk, takes the space in, looks at Nic. Silence for a while. Nic sits at the other desk.
DAVID
Have you met your roommate yet?
NIC
Yeah, he seems nice. He was just in the hall.
DAVID
I feel for you, though.
David is looking through a stack of CD’s. We notice George Michael, Celine Dion, Steve Miller Band.
28.
DAVID (CONT’D)
Ouch.
They both laugh.
NIC
No worries, I’ll educate him.
Before you know it he’ll be
listening to John Zorn.
David puts the CD’s back.
DAVID
You know, I better get going.
David gets up. They look at each other for a moment. Big moment. They hug.
NIC
Everything.
DAVID
Everything.
MUSIC RISES
David walks out.
EXT. EAST HAMPSHIRE COLLEGE GROUNDS - DAY
Nic - backpack over his shoulders - is gliding on a skateboard across the lovely campus grounds. Pale autumn sunlight. He seems carefree and confident.
INT. TUTORIAL ROOM, EAST HAMPSHIRE COLLEGE - MONTAGE
20 STUDENTS (19, 20) and a PROFESSOR (woman, 40) around a table. Nic is a little shy amidst all these new people.
NIC
So, this is a poem by Charles
Bukowski. This man saved my life
multiple times.
Some laugh. As Nic begins to read
INTERCUT WITH:
29.
INT. ROLLING STONE MAGAZINE - MEETING ROOM - DAY
David in a meeting room talking and laughing with a couple of editors.
NIC (O.S.)
I changed jobs and cities,
I hated holidays, babies... 
EXT. BACK YARD, SHEFF HOUSE - DAY
Karen painting a tree in their garden in very uplifting colors.
NIC (O.S.)
History, newspapers, museums... 
INT. TUTORIAL ROOM, EAST HAMPSHIRE COLLEGE
Eyes on Nic as he continues.
NIC
Grandmothers, marriage, movies,
spiders... 
EXT. BACK YARD, SHEFF HOUSE - DAY
The kids and David throwing balloons with paint towards a canvas. With every word of the poem another balloon splash.
NIC (O.S.)
Garbagemen, English accents, Spain, France, Italy, walnuts, and the color of range.
Karen joins in on the family fun.
BACK TO:
INT. TUTORIAL ROOM, EAST HAMPSHIRE COLLEGE
People are listening, sometimes chuckling. JULIA (18, a sweet girl) thinks Nic is cool. Nic notices, goes on.
NIC
Algebra angered me, opera sickened me, Charlie Chaplin was a fake and flowers were for
pansies.
30.
EXT. EAST HAMPSHIRE COLLEGE GROUNDS - DAY
Nic and Julia sit on the lawn, they’re talking, Nic is wildly explaining things to Julia. They seem in love and to only have eyes for each other, while masses of people stream by them, going from one class to the next.
INT. LIBRARY, EAST HAMPSHIRE COLLEGE - DAY
Nic sits at a computer. Typing. Focused.
EXT. EAST HAMPSHIRE COLLEGE GROUNDS - DAY
Julia runs her hands through Nic’s hair. They kiss and playfully roll on the lawn.
INT. LIBRARY, EAST HAMPSHIRE COLLEGE - DAY
Nic and Julia sit in the library. As they have to be silent, they write little notes to each other. They giggle.
INT. LIVING ROOM, JULIA’S HOUSE - DUSK
They’re sitting at the table, having dinner. JULIA’S MOTHER and FATHER and 2 younger BROTHERS, an OLDER SISTER and JULIA’S UNCLE.
They’re all really nice and the atmosphere is pretty relaxed, yet we get the sense Nic doesn’t fit 100% in this average middle class family, with his wild hair, torn jeans, worn sneakers.
Julia’s family is chit-chatting away, going back and forth, LOUDER and LOUDER.
Nic is trying to follow the conversation and wants to make a good impression, but it all makes him pretty nervous actually.
NIC
(to Julia)
Can I use the bathroom?
(she didn’t catch it)
Hey is there a bathroom I can use?
Julia’s mother heard it.
JULIA’S MOTHER
Of course honey. Come, I’ll show
you.
31.
Nic gets up.
INT. BATHROOM, JULIA’S HOUSE - DUSK
Nic enters a bathroom. He takes a moment for himself, then takes a piss.
While he is slowly washing his hands he sees a couple of medication bottles in the bathroom cabinet. He goes through them, sees a bottle of Percocet. He stares at it.
He dries his hands. He closes the cabinet.
INT. LIVING ROOM, JULIA’S HOUSE - LATER
Back at the table. It’s after dinner, everybody still chatting quite loud, Nic is more relaxed.
INT. NIC’S DORM ROOM, EAST HAMPSHIRE COLLEGE - DAY
Nic is on his bed on campus, a little passed out. His cell phone rings, it says ‘DAD’. Nic wakes up, and quickly gets up.
He takes a moment to gather himself before answering the phone.
NIC
Hey dad!
DAVID (O.S.)
Hey Nic. How you doing? What’s
going on?
NIC
Everything is going great. Hey, thanks for sending me that money. I really appreciate that.
INT. LIBRARY, COLLEGE - DAY
Nic sits at a computer and is surfing the web. We see a website that shows how to shoot yourself up.
He looks over his shoulder to make sure no one is watching.
INT. NIC’S DORM ROOM, EAST HAMPSHIRE COLLEGE - DAY
Nic is fighting with Julia.
32.
INT. NIC’S DORM ROOM, EAST HAMPSHIRE COLLEGE - DAY
Nic is preparing the drugs, making it liquid, getting it in the syringe, prepping his arm. It’s all a bit clumsy as he’s never done this.
EXT. EAST HAMPSHIRE COLLEGE GROUNDS - NIGHT
It’s cold outside, people are wearing warm winter jackets and caps. We spot Nic, zoned out, only wearing a T-shirt. He’s really high. He stops, stands still.
Closes his eyes.
