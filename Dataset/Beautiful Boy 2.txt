INT. LIVING ROOM, SHEFF HOUSE - DAY
Some time later. Nic is arriving back home for the holidays. He is carrying a bag and enters the living room. David is behind him and talking.
DAVID
And Patrick and Phil are going hiking tomorrow. I told them we might join. They definitely want to see you.
They hear gentle shrieks of laughter. Nic looks around the living room, nobody there. David and Nic pretend to keep on talking while looking for the kids who’ve hidden themselves.
Nic discovers banners made by the kids to welcome him. One is a hedgehog saying ‘BOOHOO I MISS NIC’. Nic is moved by it and expresses that to David inaudibly.
Nic then discovers where the kids are hiding but continues to play it cool.
NIC
Are Jasper and Daisy here?
DAVID
They’re not here.
NIC
No? Oh they didn’t want to see me?
DAVID
Nope, they didn’t want to see you.
33.
NIC
Oh that’s tough to hear. I’ll just have a seat on this couch and think about that.
Nic sits down and then rips off the cover revealing the kids. They now jump on Nic, he takes ’em both in his arms. They kinda crawl all over him. He holds them tight.
Karen enters the living room too, and smiles.
NIC (CONT’D)
You’ve grown so big guys! This is
amazing!!! I can hardly hold you.
But he does hold them and then starts turning around his axis, like a human merry-go-round. Nic starts going faster and faster as the kids are cheering. David and Karen don’t know whether to laugh, because it’s so funny, or to try and stop them, because it does look a little dangerous. But they’re all laughing so loud. When Nic slows down he almost starts losing balance, he’s a little dizzy.
Nic smiles and hugs and kisses Karen.
EXT. BACK YARD - DUSK
The Sheffs are having a nice dinner outside. Enjoying great food. So much to talk about.
After dinner they play a wordgame. When someone snaps the other person has to tell the next line of the story.
Nic starts.
NIC
(storytelling voice)
Denmark, 1632.
Snap.
DAVID
We like to look back at the history of hula hoops.
Snap. The little ones laughing uncontrollably.
NIC
So important to the culture of
peace and wisdom.
Snap. More laughter.
34.
DAVID
A man named George--
A quick snap.
NIC
Hoop Hula was--
Snap.
DAVID
Thought I’m going to develop
something... 
The family loses it. The kids barely containing their joy.
INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY, SHEFF HOUSE - NIGHT
Nic turns out the light in Jaspers bedroom. He closes the door. Alone in the hallway, he scratches his skin.
DAVID (O.S.)
Hey.
NIC
Oh hey.
Suddenly David is there.
NIC (CONT’D)
Hey, um, I was wondering if I could use the car? I still want to go to a meeting tonight.
DAVID
You have a meeting tonight? Yeah,
sure.
David leans on the banister. He takes a long look at Nic.
DAVID (CONT’D)
You good?
Nic motions towards the kid’s door and laughs to dodge the question.
NIC
Yeah...  They’re crazy.
DAVID
They’re really excited you are
home.
35.
Nic puts his hands in his pockets.
NIC
I’ll see you in the morning I
guess.
DAVID
OK.
INT. VOLVO/ROADS HOME TO INVERNESS - NIGHT
Nic is driving. He’s shivering. Feels bad. He puffs a joint.
While he is driving, he dials a number. A car passes.
Muffled sounds. Image becomes blurry. Music blasts.
Headlights on the winding roads.
INT. NIC’S BEDROOM, SHEFF HOUSE - DAY
Nic wakes up with a huge hangover. It takes a while before he realizes where he is, in his bed. He hears the kids fighting in the room next door.
JASPER (O.S.)
Where is it? Where is it?
We hear Daisy crying.
INT. KID'S BEDROOM, SHEFF HOUSE - DAY
Big drama.
JASPER
Give it back!
DAISY
I don’t have it!
They push each other around a little. More crying. David enters the room.
DAVID
What is going on here?
JASPER
I had 8 dollars. Daisy took it.
Jasper holds his plastic mini-vault in his hands. It’s empty.
36.
DAISY
I didn’t!!
DAVID
Calm down guys. Please calm down. Daisy, can you go down to your mom please?
DAISY
I didn’t take it, daddy.
DAVID
OK, please go down.
Daisy goes down. David turns to Jasper.
DAVID (CONT’D)
Are you sure it was in there?
JASPER
Yes. I had it yesterday.
INT. KITCHEN, SHEFF HOUSE - DAY
Nic sits at the table and does not look great. David stares hard at him, and sees his trembling hands, his gyrating jaw. It looks like David hasn’t slept a lot either.
DAVID
Jasper’s savings disappeared.
NIC
Yeah? That’s weird.
DAVID
Did you take his 8 dollars?
NIC
What?
DAVID
You heard me.
NIC
Why would I?
DAVID
Well, it disappeared, so someone
must have done it.
NIC
Right, so it’s me?
37.
Nic slams down his juice.
NIC (CONT’D)
This is fucking ridiculous!
He stands up.
DAVID
Nic, are you using again?
NIC
Am I using again?? No.
David examines him.
DAVID
Are you high right now?
NIC
What the fu...  No...  fuck you.
David is boiling.
DAVID
Fuck you? Don’t talk to me that
way.
(a beat)
Are you high right now?
NIC
No.
DAVID
You’re not using right now? Are you using??
NIC
No Dad I’m not fucking high right
now!
DAVID
OK.
He looks down. This is hard.
DAVID (CONT’D)
Listen it was a gamble to send you to college. Everybody supported it. I’m glad that you went. Relapse is a part of recov--
He can barely get the words out.
38.
DAVID (CONT’D)
Relapse is a part of recovery. So--
NIC
I’d better leave.
Nic heads off to his room. David doesn’t know what to do.
INT. NIC’S BEDROOM, SHEFF HOUSE - DAY
Nic sits on his bed motionless, thinking for a moment.
Suddenly he starts filling a suitcase and his duffel-bag with clothes. Grabs some stuff that is lying on his desk. He takes his guitar and walks out.
INT. HALLWAY, SHEFF HOUSE - DAY
Nic - with suitcase, duffel bag and guitar - sees David and Karen standing in the doorway.
DAVID
Hey, just...  where are you going to go? You can’t just leave. This is ridiculous. Come on.
KAREN
Can you talk to us? We just want to talk to you.
She takes a step towards him.
DAVID
Please, try to help us understand.
KAREN
Or just let us help you.
This makes Nic freak out.
NIC
(screaming)
I don’t want your fucking help. Don’t you understand that? No you don’t? Jesus Christ, what the fuck is wrong with you then, huh? What the hell is wrong with you people?
Very aggressively he pushes David away.
39.
NIC (CONT’D)
You people suffocate me!! You
fucking suffocate me!!
And now David loses it. He not only panics, but becomes furious.
DAVID
Oh, it’s us? We’re the problem?
No!!
Nic runs out.
EXT. DRIVEWAY, SHEFF HOUSE - DAY
David chases out after him.
DAVID
You are the one who is doing it!!! You're the one causing it and you're the only one who can stop it and FUCKING solve it!!!
David closes his eyes. Fuck, so stupid.
INT. NIC’S BEDROOM, SHEFF HOUSE - NIGHT
David enters Nic’s room. Everything is still the way it was when Nic left in a fury.
Some clothes scattered around. He sits on the bed, takes the room in. He turns on a lamp on Nic’s night-stand as we
CUT TO:
INT. NIC’S BEDROOM, SHEFF HOUSE - (FLASHBACK)
Just earlier.
Nic storms into his room right after the 8 dollar fight in the kitchen. He wildly knocks books off of his desk, pounds the wall and screams, before grabbing his bags to pack and leave.
BACK TO:
40.
INT. NIC’S BEDROOM, SHEFF HOUSE - NIGHT
David sees a notebook laying on the ground. He picks it up and flips through it. We see it’s a journal, with short, and longer very personal writings.
Close on David as he starts to read. He flips another page. Scribbles, hard to read what is there. Another page. We read what he reads:
1 1/2 grams speed / Klonopin /
Codeine / Valium / Hard to find
meth here. Scored some heroin
instead.
He flips to the next page, which is filled with chaotic small written text.
David looks closer at the nervous, crazy handwriting. This is the Disease talking. As if he can experience his son being changed by the drugs.
He reads a last sentence:
So all I can do is move forward... 
and don’t look back.
He closes the notebook. David looks terrified.
INT. VOLVO / GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE - DAY
David drives by himself back to Los Angeles.
INT. MEDICAL OFFICE AT UCLA - DAY
David is seated with DR. BROWN.
We have arrived back at the opening scene.
DR BROWN
So this is for the New York Times
Magazine?
DAVID
No. I’m sorry...  I write, I
freelance for different magazines
but this is a personal matter.
DR BROWN (O.S.)
A personal matter?
41.
DAVID
Yes. I’m sorry, is that okay?
DR BROWN (O.S.)
That’s absolutely okay. May I ask
what this is regarding?
DAVID
It’s about my son.
DR BROWN
Okay... 
As David begins to talk we
INTERCUT WITH:
INT. HAIGHT STREET - DUSK
David on the famous Haight Street in San Francisco, looking for Nic. We see the colorful shops. Kids with dreadlocks and dogs. Tourists with dyed hair. Tattoos. Older hippies.
DAVID (O.S.)
He has been doing all sorts of
drugs but is addicted to crystal
meth, which seems to be the worst
of all of them. And I guess I am
here because I just want to know
all that I can about all of it.
Dr. Brown is now extremely precise in his use of language.
DR BROWN
So crystal meth gives the user a feeling of instant euphoria, at least when he takes it. But when it wears off with a depletion of as much as 60 percent of the dopamine the user has to up the doses.
David walking on Haight Street. Still looking.
DR BROWN (O.S.) (CONT’D) Double it, triple it. Just to feel something.
Back at UCLA.
42.
DR BROWN (CONT’D)
Causing even more nerve damage
which increases the compulsion to
use. Horrible cycle.
CUT TO:
INT. DAVID’S STUDY, SHEFF HOUSE - NIGHT
David sitting in the dark at the computer. Karen walks in.
KAREN
What’s up?
She rests her hands on his shoulders. His eyes stay fixed on the screen.
DAVID
Just doing some research.
BACK TO:
INT. HAIGHT STREET - DUSK
David hesitates then walks up to a girl DIANE (19), she shields her eyes, takes him in. He looks closely at Diane, she’s still really young, but has clearly been damaged by the drug abuse too.
DAVID
Hey, I...  Are you hungry? You want to get something?
DIANE
Most guys just ask me for a
blowjob.
DAVID
Yeah, well, I just want to offer
you something to eat. And talk a
little. If you’re up for it.
INT. MEDICAL OFFICE AT UCLA - DAY
Dr. Brown and David are now watching a screen with brain scans. We see a lateral cross-section of a brain, with blue patches and yellow and red areas. The doctor points out the red areas.
43.
DR BROWN
The meth changes the brain physically. Here we see the loss of dopamine receptors in a meth user’s brain. Now I want to show you something else here. Do you see these two large red spots right here? What that shows is hyperactivity in the amygdala. The amygdala is a region of the brain that is linked with anxiety and fear. Here, the amygdala is screaming. What this shows us is that there is a biological basis that meth users may be unable, not un-willing, but unable to participate in normal treatment plans.
INT. OLD DINER - DUSK
David and Diane are sitting in a booth. Diane slurps her Sprite.
DIANE
I was in rehab too. 3 times. Ran
away every time.
A waiter brings two burgers. Diane starts eating.
DAVID
Why?
DIANE
It was hell, I wanted to die.
DAVID
Why was it hell?
DIANE
All that God shit. Also, you just don’t know how good it gets when it gets good.
David is listening intently.
DIANE (CONT’D)
It’s hard to explain. It feels like cocaine but multiply it by 1000...  Or like a million.
44.
INT. MEDICAL OFFICE AT UCLA
David and Dr Brown are still at the computer.
DAVID
What does this mean for Nic?
DR BROWN
Look Mr. Sheff, I don’t know who promised you what, but success percentage is in the single digits.
David looks down.
DAVID
OK.
INT. OLD DINER
DAVID
What about your parents?
No reaction.
DIANE
What about ‘em?
DAVID
Don’t you think they’re worried
about you? Shouldn’t you let them
know... 
DIANE
They don’t care... 
DAVID
I think they do.
DIANE
What the fuck do you know?
She stares at him. He stares back. It becomes uncomfortable. David realizes that she’s right, what does he know?
Diane stands up.
DIANE (CONT’D)
I gotta go.
DAVID
Oh. Ok. I’m... 
And before he can say... 
45.
DAVID (CONT’D)
Thanks.
... she’s off.
David looks at his untouched burger.
I/E. VOLVO / SAN FRANCISCO STREET/TENDERLOIN - NIGHT
It’s dark now. David drives through the Tenderloin, an area with strip clubs and cheap monthly hotel rooms, homeless people, hustlers, dealers and junkies. He cruises the streets and looks left and right. Heavy. He can’t believe his son might be here? Hard to grasp it.
David parks his car and exits. He approaches to some junkies huddled on the sidewalk.
INT. DAVID'S STUDY, SHEFF HOUSE - NIGHT
David sits at his desk for a while.
He stares at his wallet. He opens it up and takes out: crystalline powder. He watches it for a long time. His adversary. What is it with that shit?
He takes a credit card out of his wallet. Clumsy he cuts the drug a little. He takes a dollar bill and rolls it up.
He snorts the meth, stares in front of him.
We stay on his face. For a long time. He closes his eyes and tries to feel and understand what this drugs is doing to him.
His HEART is BEATING like hell. He feels as if Roman candles have been lit in his skull. We hear bits and pieces of MUSIC. And SOUNDS everywhere in the house. He hears a CAR PASSING by the house. He opens his eyes. He starts typing some thoughts.
Another sound. A garden light equipped with a motion detector flashes on. David gets up. Looks outside. Nothing.
David back at his desk. It’s a mess. Papers and pictures and books all over. The sun rises outside.
David is on his back on the floor in his study. He opens his eyes, feels miserable, tries to get back to his senses, crawls up.
46.
INT. KITCHEN, SHEFF HOUSE - MORNING
Birds are chirping. David looks out the window. He was awake the entire night.
INT. CAFFE TRIESTE - AFTERNOON
David alone at the window seat at Caffe Trieste in San Francisco (landmark coffee shop in North Beach). The empty coffee cup and glass of water suggest he’s been there a while. David looks outside.
CUT TO:
INT. CAFFE TRIESTE - AFTERNOON (FLASHBACK)
A younger David and Nic (6 years old) settle in at a table. Nic is asking questions all the time. David lavishes his full attention on Nic. He answers Nic with great dedication.
DAVID
I’m going to try some Klingon on
you.
He speaks in Klingon. Nic interprets.
NIC
Can I have a Coca-Cola?
DAVID
Exactly! That’s exactly what I
asked.
NIC
Can I have a Coca-Cola?
DAVID
If you ask me in Klingon maybe I’ll get you a Coke.
Nic tries but it mostly sounds like gibberish. It’s cute.
BACK TO:
INT. CAFFE TRIESTE - AFTERNOON
At length Nic appears, chalk-white, like a ghostly Egon Schiele self-portrait, debauched, wasted. They hug. Nic sits. His fingers tremble, his jaw gyrates, he grinds his teeth.
47.
David looks at Nic. Nic can’t look David in the eyes so he looks anywhere else.
NIC
This place hasn’t changed at all.
David gets right to it.
DAVID
So how ya doing?
NIC
I’m doing great. OK. I’m just doing what needs to be done.
A pause. David doesn’t believe it’s true, it just can’t be.
DAVID
What does that mean?
NIC
Being responsible for myself. I’ve quit on my own. I’ve got five days now.
(pause)
I feel like I’m doing well but I
just need a few hundred bucks
though.
It breaks David’s heart. Ok, so that’s why he called. But David swallows his pride, needs to find a way to get through to Nic. He stares at Nic, who can’t seem to look in David’s eyes. Nic now stares outside. David fiddles with his cutlery.
DAVID
Nic, I can’t give you any money.
NIC
It’s just a few hundred bucks. I just need to get some shit together. I want to go to New York.
DAVID
New York?
NIC
I need to get out of San Francisco, too many bad vibes here.
(beat)
I just need a few hundred bucks.
DAVID
Why don’t we just have lunch. And
talk. We can do that, can’t we?
48.
This makes Nic a little mad and fidgety. He calms down. He switches between being the old sweet Nic, and this unreasonable junkie.
NIC
How are Karen...  and the kids?
DAVID
OK. They ask about you.
(pause)
Next week is their step-up ceremony. I’m sure they‘d love you to be there. I’d love you to be there... 
NIC
See, you’re guilt-tripping me...  Look, dad, I already feel horrible about myself.
DAVID
I know they wanted you to be there.
That’s all.
NIC
I’m sorry, dad, I just need some fucking money alright. So please... 
DAVID
And then what? Where does this end?
NIC
I don’t know. It's kinda working out for me right now. You know, I gotta see this through. I got five days sober... 
DAVID
It doesn’t look like it’s working.
NIC
Oh it doesn’t look like it’s working out? So what then? Therapy?
DAVID
You can come home. We’ll make it
work. Please Nic. Please.
NIC
That wouldn’t...  No.
DAVID
I’ve been doing some research.
49.
NIC
Been doing fucking research?!
You’ve gotta be kidding me, dad!
DAVID
You think you have this under control and I understand how scared you are.
Nic gets mad.
NIC
I understand why I do things. It doesn’t make me any different. I’m attracted to craziness and you’re just embarrassed because I was like this amazing thing, like your special creation or something, and you don’t like who I am now.
David looks at Nic...  wondering where Nic is heading... 
DAVID
Yeah? And who are you Nic?
NIC
(defiant)
This is me. Here. This is who I am.
You don’t like what you see?
(a long pause)
You know, the more I think about it, Mom should have gotten custody. Because you always got to be fucking controlling everything all the time.
DAVID
Nic, you’re allowed to be mad at me. I made mistakes. I wish I hadn’t, but I did. But what you are saying right now...  it doesn’t make any sense.
NIC
You’re doing it right now!!!
You are controlling me right now!!!
David stayed calm until now, but loses his cool here... 
DAVID
This is not you. This is not you
Nic. This is the drugs talking.
50.
NIC
What does that even fucking mean?
DAVID
Psychological terror! It’s what
addicts do.
NIC
Yeah? And what the fuck are you doing right now, huh? What is this? What are you doing?
A pause. David looks at Nic, Nic doesn’t dare to look back.
NIC (CONT'D)
I didn’t want it to go like this.
(another beat)
Alright. I should go dad.
David puts his hands up. A peace offering, ‘please wait’.
DAVID
Let me book you a room at a hotel
for a couple of nights?
NIC
No dad. No.
DAVID
Why don’t we just go get some food?
Nic puts on his hat.
NIC
I gotta go.
He turns away from David... 
DAVID
Will you say goodbye at least?
NIC
Bye, dad.
Nic rushes out of the cafe. David stays behind. Suddenly aware that a lot of people are watching him.
INT. KID’S BEDROOM, SHEFF HOUSE - NIGHT
David and Jasper lay on the floor. Jasper’s head resting on David’s chest.
51.
JASPER
Where does he sleep?
DAVID
Don’t worry about that sweetie.
He’s fine.
JASPER
Maybe he has a friend and he sleeps there?
DAVID
Maybe.
On the couch Karen stops reading to Daisy and looks over to the boys.
JASPER
Can I call him?
DAVID
I tried. His phone is disconnected.
JASPER
Can I send him a message? Maybe
he’ll get it when he turns his
phone back on.
DAVID
Yes. That’s a great idea. Let’s try that.
David takes out his phone.
INT. DAVID’S STUDY, SHEFF HOUSE - NIGHT
David sits at the computer. Karen is there too, sipping tea.
She offers it to him. He declines. Starts reading.
CUT TO:
The next day.
David types into a word document, filling the page. He pauses for a moment to take a sip of coffee and review his work.
INT. LIVING ROOM, SHEFF HOUSE - NIGHT
David stands by the fireplace. He hears the sound of a car nearby. He looks out the window. The car passes by without stopping.
52.
INT. LIVING ROOM, SHEFF HOUSE - DAY
David sits on the couch, stares blankly in front of him.
KAREN (O.S.)
Dave, we’re coming out. Close your eyes!
DAVID
OK!
He closes his eyes. We hear some noises, Karen and the kids are entering the living room.
KAREN
OK! You can open them!
He opens his eyes and sees his kids, all dressed up. Jasper in white oxford, Daisy in a cute little dress.
DAVID
Oh wow...  Amazing guys!
He smiles, while the kids make funny poses.
INT. AUDITORIUM, ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY
We’re mid-ceremony of the “step-up” ceremony, a long-standing tradition at Jasper and Daisy’s elementary school.
All the CHILDREN are dressed up and standing in front of their chairs. The kids are singing and depicting the lyrics to “Catch a Falling Star” with simple movements. It’s beautiful.
David stares straight ahead. He’s emotional - struggling not to break down.
INT. DAVID AND KAREN’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
The phone rings, louder and louder. It’s deep in the night. David slowly rolls over, awake, confused. He looks at the phone on the bedside table - ringing, glowing - like it’s the most evil thing in the world. He knows what this call is, of course. He answers.
DAVID
Hello.
53.
VOICE ON PHONE (O.S.)
This is Julie Ford. I’m the
admissions nurse at Bellevue
Hospital, New York. Is Nic Sheff
your son?
E/I. DRIVEWAY / LIVING ROOM, SHEFF HOUSE - DAY
David drives off in a hurry. Karen - from the living room - watches him drive away.
INT. DEPARTURES, SF AIRPORT - NIGHT
David sits at the gate with his arms crossed. Still staring straight ahead. There’s hardly anyone there at this time.
INT. PLANE BEFORE TAKEOFF - SOON AFTER
David is in his seat, the plane almost fully boarded. He is on the phone.
BELLEVUE DOCTOR (O.S.) Mr. Sheff, sorry we missed each other earlier. So Nic is still experiencing some respiratory depression but his vital signs are returning.
A flight attendant comes to reprimand David, as the doors are closed.
FLIGHT ATTENDANT
Sir? Sir! We are ready for
departure.
DAVID
OK. Okay... 
(to the Doctor)
May I talk to him?
BELLEVUE DOCTOR (O.S.)
No I’m sorry but that won’t be
possible. He’s sleeping right now
and we shouldn’t wake him up. Try
again in a few hours.
FLIGHT ATTENDANT
Sir I need you to turn off your
phone.
David holds his hand up... 
54.
DAVID
Okay.
FLIGHT ATTENDANT
Sir!
DAVID
(to the Doctor)
Would you please let him know that
I’m on my way.
INT. NY ST. AUGUSTUS HOSPITAL, NEW YORK -	HOURS LATER (DAY)
Nervous David walks to a NURSE at a busy nurses’ station.
NURSE
I’m sorry sir. He checked out.
Against doctors orders.
DAVID
What? No. No! He OD’ed.
NURSE
I’m sorry sir. He pulled out the IV and catheter and left.
DAVID
How long ago?
NURSE
Ten, fifteen minutes. I’m sorry
sir.
Damn. David sighs. What now?
INT. JFK - DUSK
David is waiting at a nearly empty gate. Again. His phone rings. He answers.
DAVID
Yes... ?
All we hear on the other end is a quivering voice.
INT. DONUT SHOP - NIGHT
David enters a rundown donut shop. He sees Nic sitting at a table inside, almost falling asleep, unaware of David. He looks the worst we’ve ever seen him. David watches him for a moment, then takes a seat opposite Nic, who opens his eyes.
55.
David doesn’t know what to say. Tears come down on Nic’s cheek. David feels for him, he looks sad and vulnerable.
NIC
Look, I’ve thought about it and I’m done with drugs. Finished. This is it. I’m telling you dad, I’m done.
David thinks it’s bullshit, but doesn’t show it. He pauses.
Instead he tries to find a way to get through to Nic.
DAVID
And how would that work? I mean,
after what just happened.
Nic thinks about it, realizes his fantasy, starts crying.
INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
A bland hotel room. The TV on local news. David on the phone with Vicki. Meanwhile Nic lays on the floor in his underwear. The rest of his clothes scattered across the room.
On the desk we see remnants of a pizza ordered in the room.
DAVID
So at 3 there is a conference call with the intake people of Mississippi. And 3:30 one in New Mexico. At 4 the one in Oregon.
VICKI (O.S.)
I did some research on the New
Mexico one.
DAVID
Yeah?
VICKI (O.S.)
They charge $40,000 a month.
DAVID
You know, it’s not even that well
rated. We’ll just skip that one.
VICKI (O.S.)
Listen, if a spot opens up here in Los Angeles maybe that’s the best solution for now. I’ll hear back from them in an hour.
David looks over at Nic on the floor.
56.
VICKI (O.S.) (CONT’D) Give it a rest David. Why don’t you let me take over for now.
The phone call now over, David covers Nic with a blanket.
He looks at him on the floor. His thin and frail body. The marks on his arms. He rubs his hair, ‘good night’.
MATCH CUT TO:
INT. NIC’S OLD BEDROOM - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
A younger David rubbing 4-year-old Nic’s hair as he lies in his bed and is almost sleeping. David closes a book, just finished telling a story. Nic’s eyelids are dropping.
NIC
Daddy?
DAVID
Yes?
NIC
Will you check on me every 15
minutes?
David smiles, tucks Nic in.
DAVID
Yes.
Nic - perfectly safe - closes his eyes, drifts away in his sleep.
Then, in his beautiful, slightly off-key, imperfect singing voice, David sings the John Lennon song “Beautiful Boy” -
DAVID (CONT’D)
Close your eyes,
Have no fear,
The monster’s gone,
He's on the run
And your daddy's here.
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful -
Beautiful Boy
Before you cross the street,
Take my hand,
Life is just what happens to you
While you‘re busy making other
plans.
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful -
Beautiful Boy. [etc.]
57.
David’s singing continues as we
CUT TO:
INT. NIC’S OLD BEDROOM - DAY (FLASHBACK, CONT.)
Where he and Nic are now packing a Hello Kitty suitcase. Clothes and toys. Now Nic is silent, and David is talking all the time.
DAVID
Didn’t you want to take your
trolls?
Nic shakes his head.
(in the background, David’s singing is now backed by the original John Lennon track)
David walks to Nic’s bookcase.
DAVID (CONT’D)
How about a book?
Nic is pretty quiet. He shakes his head no.
INT. DEPARTURES, SF AIRPORT - DAY (FLASHBACK CONT’D)
David and Nic are at the gate. Nic is wearing a pink paper badge with his name written in Magic Marker.
A Delta flight attendant is waiting while David is saying goodbye to Nic. Other UNACCOMPANIED MINORS start to board.
David kneels to say goodbye to Nic. Nic is sulking.
The song softens in the background.
DAVID
Can I get a hug?
Nic shakes his head.
DAVID (CONT’D)
What, no? No hug? Why not?
Indeed, no hug.
DAVID (CONT’D)
Are you mad at me? Cos you have to go?
58.
An angry yes. The music fades.
DAVID (CONT’D)
OK. But you’ll be happy to see your mommy, right?
Also a yes. But also close to tears.
DAVID (CONT’D)
I want you to know something, when you come back I’m going to be here. I’m going to be right here for you. OK? And call me when you miss me and I’ll call you.
Nic nods.
DAVID (CONT’D)
Do you know how much I love you?
Nic shakes his head hesitantly.
The airline attendant is watching, a little nervous, they need to go, but she doesn’t want to come in between.
DAVID (CONT’D)
If you could take all the words in the language, it still wouldn’t describe how much I love you. And even if I could gather all those words together, that still wouldn’t describe what I feel for you. What I feel for you means everything. I love you more than everything.
NIC
Everything?
DAVID
Everything.
Nic hugs David now. Then gets up. The airline attendant takes Nic’s hand.
David nods. Nic walks away with the airline attendant.
INT. REHAB 3 - DAY
Vicki walks into a new rehab. Less fancy this time. She finds Nic - looking just a little better - having breakfast with a couple of timid YOUNGER GUYS. Nic is a rehab sophomore now.
59.
He looks up, sees Vicki standing there. She smiles when he sees her.
NIC
Hey! That’s my mom.
INT. LIVING ROOM, REHAB 3 - DAY
Nic and Vicki sit in sofas and are drinking tea. They’re both pretty relaxed actually, considering the circumstances.
VICKI
I’m really glad you came to LA. You know that right?
She looks Nic straight in the eyes before speaking through sobs.
VICKI (CONT’D)
You just don’t know what it is to
be a parent.
Nic stares straight ahead.
NIC
Please don’t do this mom.
She fights to hold back her tears and pull it together.
VICKI
All I could think about was you.
NIC
I know this must sound meaningless, but I’m sorry. I really am.
VICKI
Oh Nicky... 
She puts her arm around him and pulls him in closer.
VICKI (CONT’D)
You’re such a darling. You know
that, right?
Nic shakes his head. He doesn’t believe it.
She kisses his forehead 3 times, short, longer, longest.
MUSIC RISES.
60.
EXT. ROADS, TOPANGA CANYON - DAY
Nic appears in the distance, riding his 10-speed through Topanga Canyon. Although he is drenched in sweat and grunting he looks pretty great actually.
MUSIC is BIG now.
Changing gears, up a hill, down a hill.
We now see he is chasing SPENCER (40’s), his sponsor. He’s pushing it 200%.
As they arrive at a steep hill, Nic, younger and lighter, overtakes Spencer.
NIC
Come on old man!
SPENCER
(playful)
You are being so disrespectful!
Spencer catches up to him.
SPENCER (CONT’D)
I’m coming for ya! You about to
look at my ass!
NIC
Motherfucker!
CLOSE on Nic who’s in pain but does not give up. PRIMAL AGONY, pedalling HARD:
NIC (CONT’D)
Aaaaaarrrrgggghhhhhhhhh!!
Nic reaches the top. In the background Spencer falls over in defeat. Nic wins. They stop, laugh at each other.
Nic rides back to Spencer and helps him up.
SPENCER
So that’s what I get for helping
you out? Thanks man.
NIC
Sorry old man. I’m ruthless!
Puffing. They enjoy the view.
61.
EXT. GARDEN NIC’S STUDIO - DAY
Vicki and Nic are carrying Nic’s stuff towards his studio, which is located above a garage in the back of a garden of a large house.
INT. STUDIO NIC - DAY
They enter the studio. Drop the stuff. Nic looks at his new place. It’s not huge, but his own. Nic opens a window and looks outside.
When done, Nic sits down and watches his shelf with all his stuff. Vicki watches him.
VICKI
How does this feel?
He smiles.
NIC
Like I’m a real human being.
INT. CHURCH - DAY
A 12-step meeting. Quite a lot of people. Lots of young and hip people in LA.
Nic looks good. He takes in the space and speaks to the group.
NIC
One day I tried methamphetamine and I thought, this is what’s been missing. I felt complete. And I’ve been chasing that high ever since. No matter how much meth or whatever else I can find to shoot up into my body, I knew it’s never enough. I went to a couple of rehabs, a detox, we would talk about disease. Sure. But it never clicked. Until one day I woke up in a hospital and someone asked me, what’s your problem? I said I’m an alcoholic and an addict and he said no that’s how you’ve been treating your problem.
People nod ‘that’s right’. We see Vicki and Spencer seated together in the back. Vicki watching. Spencer nodding.
62.
NIC (CONT’D)
I know now I need to find a way to fill this big black hole in me. Anyway. I’m 14 months clean. I have a job at a rehab, and it’s fulfilling to help other people get sober. I have a sponsor, Spencer, he shows me how great my life can be sober. I still have a family. My mom has been amazing. My dad has been amazing too...  I want them to be proud of me.
I/E. MAZDA / VARIOUS LOCATIONS - DAY
Nic is driving a $500 Mazda on Inverness roads. “Heart of Gold” by Neil Young plays. He opens the window and hangs his arm outside. Enjoys this so so much.
INT. ROOM, HOUSE KAREN’S PARENTS - DAY (FLASHBACK)
A younger David is getting dressed, suit and bowtie. Nic, 8 years old here, sits on the bed, he is wearing a shirt that is slightly too big, blue trousers and All Stars.
Nic is dangling his legs up and down.
DAVID
You alright? What’s wrong? Are you nervous.
NIC
Yeah.
EXT. TERRACE, HOUSE KAREN’S PARENTS - DUSK (FLASHBACK CONT’D)
David, Karen and Nic stand on a terrace, where they have gathered with some friends and family for a cosy wedding. The terrace has a great view of hills and trees. It’s a beautiful day.
Karen wears a simple white dress.
KAREN
(to David)
Thank you for marrying me. Thank you for being a perfect partner in an imperfect world. Thank you for introducing me to your amazing son. I’m here for you and I’m here to stay.
63.
People cheer.
DAVID
(to Karen)
Karen, thank you for loving me.
David looks at Nic.
DAVID (CONT’D)
And thank you for loving him.
They kiss. Karen gestures Nic to come in between them. Nic holds hands with both of them. He smiles, although still nervous. They kiss again.
Cheering!
CUT TO:
Drinks afterwards. It’s joyful and informal. A couple of musicians are playing music on their acoustic instruments. Talking, laughing.
David is talking to a friend about Nic who stands a few feet away dancing to the music.
The friend laughs. David and Karen look over at Nic. Still dancing.
EXT. DRIVEWAY, SHEFF HOUSE - DAY
Back to the present.
Nic arrives home. He parks on the driveway. Steps out of the car.
David appears. Then Jasper, Daisy, Karen. Everybody is excited but also nervous. The dogs are BARKING LOUD, a little aggressive.
