Nic hugs everybody separately.
NIC
Dad. Good to see you.
CUT TO:
NIC (CONT’D)
Dayze.
CUT TO:
64.
NIC (CONT’D)
Jazzy Jeff. I missed you more than the sun misses the moon at night.
Jasper hugs him back, but is a little silent. They haven’t seen each other for such a long time.
NIC (CONT’D)
Hi Karen.
KAREN
Hey.
Somehow it’s really tense when Nic and Karen hug. They both have tiny tears.
NIC
Thank you for inviting me.
Seriously.
INT. NIC’S OLD BEDROOM, SHEFF HOUSE -	DUSK
Nic enters his bedroom, which has been transformed into an adjunct playroom with lots of LEGO-creations, easels, and art projects.
He puts his bag on the floor, sits on his bed, looks at all the toys.
Nic takes his laptop out of his backpack, and opens it. He starts typing hesitantly, sometimes going back, correcting, then continuing.
EXT. BACK YARD, SHEFF HOUSE - DAY
A glorious, sunny day. A lush green garden.
A garden sprinkler starts spraying water up in the air. It moves from left to right. Nic, Jasper, and Daisy run and play around it. They come close to it, yet try to avoid to get wet. Laughter. Shrieks. Of course they get wet. Bright colors, sunlight piercing the ropes of water splashing through the air, the children’s skin glistening.
David sits in a deck chair. He is trying to read the New Yorker, but keeps looking up at his kids with a big smile.
Nic picks up Jasper in one arm and then Daisy in the other. He spins them both through the sprinkler, the kids laugh as hard as they can. David calls out.
65.
DAVID
Hey! Easy.
But he can’t help but laugh too.
INT. DAVID’S STUDY, SHEFF HOUSE - DAY
David is reading an e-mail to Karen.
DAVID
‘...  If the marker is depleted in meth addicts’ brains, it’s likely that there is a loss of nerve terminals, and the brain damage is irreversible. However, when I tested for V-MAT2, I found normal levels.’
KAREN
So there is cause for optimism?
DAVID
Normal levels is optimistic. Yes.
Karen looks at him.
KAREN
I was just checking!
He continues.
DAVID
Basically Nic’s ‘fried’ nerve endings can grow back. They say it can take two years.
KAREN
Two years. Well, that’s great
David.
Tiny smile from David.
INT. LIVING ROOM, SHEFF HOUSE - NIGHT
David sits at the fire place. He has a book in his hands but isn’t really reading. He hears a car stopping in front of the house. He looks up.
CUT TO:
Nic walks in. Takes a seat. Watches David.
66.
DAVID
You’re pretty late.
NIC
Yeah. It was a great meeting. After we went to this speaker’s house and watched a video. Some of my sober sponsoring bro’s were there.
David puts his book down.
DAVID
No phone?
NIC
My cell was dead.
DAVID
(hates to ask)
Would you be OK to do a drug test?
Nic becomes silent and angry too, but swallows his pride.
NIC
Yeah. Sure dad.
David stands up, goes to the kitchen, takes a plastic cup, gives it to Nic.
DAVID
You understand why, right?
NIC
I should’ve called to let you know.
So... 
DAVID
I trust you, but we just need to
have some kind of proof, ok?
Nic is a little down.
NIC
That’s about as contradictory as it gets. But I know. I’ll do it, no worries, nothing to hide.
A beat.
DAVID
Hey. You’re doing great.
NIC
Yeah... 
67.
DAVID
You really are. By my count you’re at 485 days clean.
Nic nods.
NIC
I’ll just leave it in the bathroom.
Nic walks away waving his plastic cup in his hands. He stops and hugs David.
NIC (CONT’D)
Goodnight dad. I love you.
DAVID
I love you too.
Nic disappears in the dark.
INT. BATHROOM, SHEFF HOUSE - NIGHT
David checks the drug test. He turns off the light.
EXT. REMOTE BEACH - DAY
The family is walking on a path that leads to a beautiful remote beach. Everybody is carrying something, stuff they brought to spend a couple of hours there. Jasper and Nic are carrying a surfboard. They’re both really excited and teasing each other as they walk.
They arrive at the beautiful beach, look at the pretty big waves out there. Jasper and Nic run towards the water and play a little in the water in the incoming waves.
Meanwhile, David and Karen install themselves on the beach.
Karen looks a little worried.
Nic and Jasper are strapping the leg ropes of their surfboards on and making their way to go in the water and surf.
NIC
Alright Jasper, you ready?
JASPER
Yep.
NIC
Let’s go, let’s go, let’s go!
68.
They run towards the water. Karen chases after them.
KAREN
Hey no, no, wait! Jasper I don’t
want you to go out there.
JASPER
Mom, we won’t go far. I swear!
KAREN
The waves are too big. It’s too
dangerous.
JASPER
But I’m a great swimmer. I’ve been in waves that were way bigger than this.
KAREN
Yes I know that but--
Nic joins the conversation, he is sweet.
NIC
I’ll stay close... 
JASPER
Nic will stay close, you see?
Karen is emotional about it, primal fear kicks in. David is watching and senses it. He gets up from his seat.
NIC
Karen, I’m going to stay close.
KAREN
Nic can go in. That’s fine, but
you, no. And that is final.
JASPER
(jokingly)
We’ll see about that!
KAREN
Hey!
David takes a few step closer towards the boys. Nic tries to stay positive.
NIC
Ok, it’s fine. It’s fine.
They all just stand there and look at the waves. They are indeed quite big.
69.
NIC (CONT’D)
(to Jasper)
Shall we play a game instead? Yeah?
Jasper is taken aback a little. He nods.
JASPER
Yeah.
Nic playfully bumps his head into Jasper’s chest to cheer him up. They head back up the beach.
CUT TO:
A little later. Karen, Daisy and David are building a castle. Jasper and Nic are laying on the beach, face to face, playing a wordgame.
NIC
Are you a hurfboard? No? Are you a hicycle?
It makes Jasper laugh. He shakes his head.
NIC (CONT’D)
OK, uhm, are you edible?
JASPER
Not really.
NIC
Not really?
JASPER
Not really.
NIC
So sort of...  Are you a house?
JASPER
Yes. How did you know?
NIC
Just, you know, I can read your
mind.
Jasper laughs. Nic sees David is following their conversation.
NIC (CONT’D)
Hey...  I know you’re a great
swimmer. I’m going to be there to
cheer for you at your next swim
meet. How does that sound?
70.
Jasper smiles. A silence. Nic looks at Jasper.
NIC (CONT’D)
Hey is it weird to see me after
such a long time or no?
JASPER
I guess it was at first. I thought maybe you might be different. But you’re the same old Nic.
Now Nic smiles.
MUSIC RISES.
INT. KITCHEN, SHEFF HOUSE - DAY
Next morning. Bright sun through the windows. Nic walks in and hugs David.
NIC
Thanks. It was a great weekend.
DAVID
Take care.
Nic nods.
EXT. DRIVEWAY, SHEFF HOUSE - DAY
Nic steps into his Mazda. The family gathers at the door.
While Nic drives off, they wave.
David is watching Nic drive off. And, isn’t there a sad look on Nic’s face?
I/E. MAZDA / INVERNESS ROADS - DAY
Nic is driving on the Inverness roads.
EXT. MARIN VALLEY SCHOOL, SAN RAFAEL - DAY (FLASHBACK)
It’s Nic’s graduating class on the lovely grounds of Marin Valley School. A BRASS BAND starts playing. YOUNG STUDENTS start to walk up the grounds in a row. PARENTS, FRIENDS, LOVED ONES are taking seats on the bleachers.
Amongst them the whole Sheff-family. David, Karen, Jasper, Daisy.
71.
David is talking to the FATHER of one of Nic’s fellow students. Karen, Daisy and Jasper are trying to spot Nic among the students.
David and the whole family cheer now as Nic goes towards the stage. Even other people are cheering for Nic. Little Daisy is enraptured. David is really really proud.
DAVID
Go get’em!
Nic steps up - kisses the Principal - looks out and grins wickedly to his family. David laughs.
While making his way down the stage, Nic shakes hands with teachers standing in line with a big smile, he even hugs one of them, the teacher is surprised.
As other student’s names are called, OTHER FAMILIES are cheering too. For David it feels like everybody is cheering for Nic.
Before he steps off the stage, Nic waves to his family one more time.
EXT. DRIVEWAY, SHEFF HOUSE - DAY
And we cut back to the moment when Nic gets in his Mazda and drives off from the Sheff house.
Nic does look a little sad. He watches the family wave in his rearview mirror.
I/E. MAZDA / FREEWAY - DAY
Nic is driving on the freeway. He’s nervous. He takes an exit.
I/E. MAZDA / PARKING - DAY
Nic sits in his car, close to the freeway, cars passing by in the background.
He’s out of sorts. He takes his phone and dials a number.
SPENCER (O.S.)
One day at a time, man.
Congratulations. Welcome to the
real world, I’m glad you made it.
72.
NIC
I don’t want to live in the real world. I’m so sick of living in the real world.
SPENCER (O.S.)
Bullshit. That's your disease
talking, man. Wanting to isolate
you, so it can kill you.
NIC
I don't feel like I have a disease, Spencer. This is not like fucking cancer. This is my fucking choice. I put myself here.
SPENCER (O.S.)
Yeah you did. You did put yourself here. Now are you going to let me talk? Or what?
A beat.
SPENCER (O.S.) (CONT’D)
OK. You’re a writer, right? So
write. You’re good at it. This is
your day--
Nic puts down the phone. He is struggling. He picks it back up.
SPENCER (O.S.) (CONT’D) Once you get high though, you lose everything. So you’ve gotta keep choosing the right way.
Nic exits the car. He stands hunched over the open door.
NIC
Right.
He clenches his teeth.
SPENCER (O.S.)
That’s right. Choose the right way.
Nic seems relieved.
NIC
Hey listen, I’m going to give you a call a little later, alright? I feel like I’m going to do alright.
73.
SPENCER (O.S.)
You blowing me off now? Don’t waste my time. I’m here for you man. You know what, I’m having some steaks tonight. Why don’t you come over for dinner?
NIC
That sounds great. I’ll see you
then. Yessir. I’ll see you then.
Nic’s lips start quivering, as if he’s about to cry. Spencer can feel him teetering in the silence on the phone.
SPENCER (O.S.)
Nic. Nic! Nic--
NIC
Alright, bye-bye.
Nic hangs up, but starts crying again. He closes the car door and paces back and forth, swaying in every direction.
We now see where he is, he’s at a parking lot overlooking the Golden Gate Bridge and San Francisco.
EXT. MAZDA / HAIGHT STREET - NIGHT
Nic sits on the hood of his Mazda, parked in the colorful Haight Street. A sixpack on the passenger seat, Nic takes a can of beer and opens it. His eyes are on fire. He drinks. He’s smoking a cigarette. This is obviously just the beginning, the beast is loose.
He downs the can of beer. Opens the next. He is looking at his arms, making a fist, making his veins stand out.
He notices LAUREN walking by on the sidewalk (19, thin, fragile girl). He knows her, but where from? She notices him, and recognizes him too. She comes towards him.
LAUREN
Nic Sheff!
NIC
Hi... 
Lauren... !
There’s something strange about her, but she’s also really cute.
74.
LAUREN
God it’s been a long time. What are you doing here?
NIC
Well... 
Nic is thinking. Should he tell the truth?
LAUREN
What?
NIC
I’ve been sober for a while, but
I’m seriously looking to party
right now.
I/E. MAZDA / SAN FRANCISCO STREETS - MONTAGE
Nic drives while Lauren drinks a beer in the passenger.
They cruise through the shady Tenderloin. Nic parks. He takes out another cigarette as two DEALERS walk over to the car.
He rolls down the window.
DEALER
I got what you need!
The dealer shakes two baggies. Nic reaches for both.
INT. LIVING ROOM, LAUREN’S PARENTS HOUSE	-	NIGHT
Nic and Lauren enter Lauren’s house. A fancy place overlooking Baker Beach. Nic sits on the couch and immediately throws two syringes onto a glass coffee table.
NIC
Can you get me a cup of water and a spoon?
LAUREN
Mmmhmm.
She exits. Nic sits and looks around the room, fiddling with a baggie in his hand. She returns. He smiles.
LAUREN (CONT’D)
Here you go.
She hands him the water and puts the spoon on the table.
75.
Nic prepares the drugs like a pro. Crushing the meth, heating it up. Pulling it up a syringe. And another one, with a little less. Lauren is watching, a little nervous.
Nic finds a vein and shoots up. He coughs, almost choking. (happens when the chemicals reach the brain). His eyes water up. His breathing intensifies.
NIC
Goddamn... . Godddamn.
CUT TO:
Now Nic shoots up Lauren.
NIC (CONT’D)
There it is. That’s it.
She coughs too. A lot. Hard breathing.
LAUREN
Wow.
Nic smiles at her.
NIC
You see? I told ya.
They sit there staring at each other. Not saying a word. He starts kissing her. She kisses him back. He kisses her harder.
INT. BATHROOM, LAUREN’S PARENTS HOUSE - NIGHT
They have sex in the shower. It’s wild and sexy. Nic looks cool. They go on for a long time. Kissing, moaning, fucking.
Lauren comes. Nic keeps on going.
CUT TO:
INT. LIVING ROOM, LAUREN’S PARENTS HOUSE - DAY
Nic is sitting on the couch in his underwear next to his belt still tied in a loop for his arm. He looks bad. He’s been throwing up.
He looks out at the coffee table. It’s a huge mess. Bottles of wine. Drug paraphernalia layed out. Crystal meth. Heroin. Not much left.
76.
He starts to cry. He curls into the fetal position and grabs hold of the nearest pillow.
While he cries we hear David leaving him a voice-mail.
DAVID (O.S.)
It’s dad again. I feel like you might have been a little down when you left, Nic. So I’m here to talk if you need to.
CUT TO:
INT. DAVID’S STUDY, SHEFF HOUSE - DAY
David hangs up the phone. He sits in his study. Thinking.
EXT. BACK YARD, SHEFF HOUSE - DAY
David is on the phone. Making another call.
DAVID
So you have no idea where he is?
VICKI (O.S.)
Spencer told me he heard from him. He was having a difficult time but was pulling through. But, yeah, he’s not at work. Not at home. Unreachable on his cell.
DAVID
Damn, Vicki. He left here two days ago...  Why haven’t you checked on him since? You’re supposed to be taking care of him, right?
[INTERCUT WITH VICKI IN HER OFFICE IN LA]
Vicki looks out of sorts.
VICKI
What the fuck, David. Who’s been
taking care of him the last year?
DAVID
You could’ve checked on him! What
the fuck is your problem?
77.
VICKI
What do you think I do all day? And besides that, we can't run surveillance on him 24/7.
DAVID
(not listening to Vicki) I think you need to go to the police right now and file a missing persons report. OK?!
VICKI (O.S.)
Stop YELLING at me!!
DAVID
No I’m not going to stop yelling at you! Because you are just...  what are you even doing there!
VICKI (O.S.)
You’re being unfair David.
DAVID
Listen to me!
Vicki is grasping for air, it’s too much for her. She starts crying. She hangs up.
ON DAVID: his eyes like black saucers of rage.
All of a sudden he flings his phone across the lawn, into the trees beyond the yard.
DAVID (CONT’D)
FUCK.
CUT TO:
David angrily rummages around in the foliage, looking for his phone. Karen finds him.
KAREN
Dave?
David turns and sees her.
DAVID
(anguished)
Can you call my phone, please?
KAREN
What’s going on?
78.
DAVID
He’s gone.
David is shaking his head. Karen too. What now? David starts looking for his phone again. Karen too.
INT. BEDROOM DAVID & KAREN, SHEFF HOUSE - NIGHT
David is throwing UNDERWEAR, SHIRTS, a TOILETRIES POUCH and other items into a TRAVEL BAG. Karen enters, giving David the a ‘what’s-going-on’-look.
KAREN
How do we even know he’s in LA? I mean he could be in San Francisco. He could be in fucking Mexico for all we know.
DAVID
I need to go.
KAREN
And I need you to stay.
DAVID
I told you, Vicki can’t handle it.
KAREN
I don’t care about Vicki. This
isn’t about Vicki!!
DAVID
Why don’t you just relax and try to be reasonable.
KAREN
What? You be reasonable!
DAVID
I am being reasonable.
KAREN
IS THIS REASONABLE?
DAVID
NO IT’S NOT! How can I be? My son is out there somewhere and I don’t know what he’s doing. I don’t know how to help him!
KAREN
YOU CAN’T!
79.
David lets that sink in. It hurts but it might be true.
Karen is silent for a moment. Then sits on the bed.
Jasper enters their room in his PJ’s, still sleepy.
KAREN (CONT’D)
Hey big man. What’s up?
JASPER
I can’t sleep.
She picks him up and carries him out of the room.
JASPER (O.S.) (CONT’D)
Good night daddy.
DAVID
Good night.

David in a meeting room with a couple of editors. David is trying his best to not constantly check his phone.
EXT. PATHWAY LEADING TO INVERNESS AQUATICS CENTER - DAY
David, Karen, Daisy and Jasper just parked the car and walk to the entrance of the swimming pool. A lot of kids and parents are arriving and entering.
Both Daisy and Jasper have a bag with their bathing suits.
JASPER
I thought Nic was gonna be here
today.
DAVID
Something came up.
JASPER
Can I call him?
DAVID
That’s not going to be possible.
JASPER
Why not?
DAVID
Because it’s not.
Silence. Jasper hesitates.
JASPER
Is Nic back on drugs again?
Wow. Karen looks at David. They both don’t know what to say.
A long silence. Karen is honest.
KAREN
We don’t know, honey.
Jasper nods. He walks off, takes Daisy along.
INT. KITCHEN, SHEFF HOUSE - DAY
The phone rings throughout the house. No answer. It clicks through to an answer machine.
81.
EXT. DRIVEWAY, SHEFF HOUSE - DAY
Nic and Lauren arrive at the front door, Nic lifts a pot plant, nothing there. He tries another pot, again nothing.
It makes him angry. He throws the pot to the floor. He kicks the solid door, nothing happens.
EXT. BACK YARD - DAY
Nic goes around the back. He creeps along different doors and windows, and checks if one of them is open.
He starts banging and pounding on a back door, until it breaks open and he slams to the ground. He bounces right back up. If he weren’t high, his limbs would hurt after this.
INT. SHEFF HOUSE - DAY
We follow Nic who walks through the house and gathers stuff he can take along.
In a storage he takes a jacket, a Nintendo console, some bottles of wine. An old laptop. From the kitchen a bottle of Vodka. He dumps some stuff into a woven laundry basket.
Meanwhile Lauren is looking at art books, etc.
INT. DAVID'S STUDY, SHEFF HOUSE - DAY
Nic enters David’s study. He opens drawers of his desk, looking for stuff he can take. He’s progressively angrier and angrier.
On David’s desk Nic sees print-outs of stuff David is writing. He looks at it, his own name appears quite a few times.
He reads the top line: Nic didn’t come home last night.
Then the last: Have you seen my son? Have you seen my beautiful boy? Tell him I miss him.
INT. INVERNESS AQUATICS CENTER - DAY
The competition is on. BOYS and GIRLS of all ages in their bathing suits. Different TEAMS, amongst them Jasper’s team ‘Angry Tuna’. Jasper is just about to get on a starting block, while David and Karen stand to the side of the pool. Karen waves, but Jasper doesn’t see her.
82.
Behind Jasper we notice a large banner from the local swim team that says: ‘Nothing in life is so complicated that it cannot be achieved by discipline and hard work’.
And GOOOOOOOO! Jasper dives into the water, and swims as fast as he can. Karen is watching and cheering. David looks pretty stressed out.
A little later, David walks out checking his phone. Karen sees him walking out. She’s angry. She focuses on Jasper again.
INT. LIVING ROOM, SHEFF HOUSE - DAY
Nic is watching the basket and the stuff he wanted to take with him . . . What a stupid idea.
At that moment we hear a car pull up in the driveway.
He rushes to a window. It’s the family arriving. Nic, instant panic mode.
NIC
Oh fuck.
(loud whisper)
Hey Lauren.
LAUREN
What’s going on?
NIC
Let’s go. We gotta go.
They rush out of the back.
EXT. DRIVEWAY, SHEFF HOUSE - DAY
In the driveway David, Karen, and the kids all get out of the car. Jasper is wearing a medal around his neck. The back of the car is filled with bags of groceries. David and Karen pick them up and carry them.
KAREN
Honeys, can you help us out here?
They all take something - David the bulk. They walk to the front door, Karen opens it. They enter.
INT. LIVING ROOM AND KITCHEN, SHEFF HOUSE - DAY
They pass the living room.
83.
Dump the groceries in the kitchen.
Karen starts unpacking. Jasper takes a banana and starts eating it, just hanging a little in the kitchen.
Daisy goes up the stairs to her room.
David heads back outside.
EXT. DRIVEWAY, SHEFF HOUSE - DAY
As David enters the house again with the last groceries, he notices the broken plant pot at the entrance.
INT. LIVING ROOM AND KITCHEN, SHEFF HOUSE - DAY
David enters again with the last groceries.
JASPER
I think I just saw Nic... 
KAREN
What hon?
JASPER
I think I just saw Nic and a girl.
Running away.
Dumbstruck for a moment...  David rushes outside.
EXT. DRIVEWAY, SHEFF HOUSE / AND STREETS SURROUNDING- DAY
David runs onto the street, sees Nic and Lauren, but they’re pretty far away. They’re running.
DAVID
Nic, Nic!
CUT TO:
Nic, white as a sheet, sprinting. Lauren beside him. They go around a corner into a bush.
NIC
Fuck! Fuck!
CUT TO:
David runs on the street now, but doesn’t see Nic anymore.
84.
Karen, Daisy and Jasper run to the front door. Daisy calls out.
DAISY
Nic!
Karen spins around.
KAREN
No! Stay inside. I am not kidding.
She shuts the door.
CUT TO:
Nic and Lauren clamber into the Mazda, try to be as quiet as possible, though they’re gasping for breath.
LAUREN
What do we do?
He kisses her and tries to calm her down.
NIC
It’s alright. It’s alright.
Through the bush they see David running past them.
NIC (CONT’D)
Oh fuck.
They wait just a little more until David is further along. Nic starts the engine, hits the gas and rushes into the other direction.
CUT TO:
David turns around as he sees and hears the Mazda drive off in the other direction.
DAVID
Oh no... 
Nic has to drive past the house. Nic sees Karen. She is distraught. She looks at Nic, wild and scared at the same time.
Close on Karen: what now? She jumps in the car, starts the engine.
JASPER
(from inside)
Mom?
85.
Karen simply gestures again - Stay there! - as she reverses it onto the street, takes off, disappears. It’s wild and loud and scary.
CUT TO:
Back to David, who is walking back - out of breath - and now sees Karen in the car speeding off, going after Nic... 
DAVID
No! No!
David loses it, everything just seems to slip out of his hands.
I/E. MAZDA / STREETS OF INVERNESS - DAY
Nic driving, looking behind him. And then there’s Karen in the distance gaining ground.
NIC
Ah, no!
He floors it.
Nic turns a corner. Karen not far behind it.
I/E. MAZDA / STREETS AROUND INVERNESS - DAY
On a stretch of Marin County road, Nic powers along.
LAUREN
(looking behind)
I think we’re losing her... 
Karen way back there.
I/E. CAR, STREETS AROUND INVERNESS - DAY
Karen is slowing down. Suddenly realizing this is crazy. She comes to a stop in the middle of the road.
She watches the Mazda ahead in the distance. Stares blankly.
Motionless.
And suddenly: she’s weeping. It all comes out, floods of tears, huge gulping sobs.
86.
EXT. DRIVEWAY, SHEFF HOUSE - DAY
David walks up to the driveway. Daisy is crying.
Jasper is consoling her.
DAVID
I’m sorry guys.
David looks at them...  doesn’t know what to do anymore. He comes closer to his kids. Sits on the ground near them.
DAVID (CONT’D)
I’m so sorry.
EXT. PORTRERO HILL, SF - NIGHT
Nic is taking a walk and smoking a cigarette by himself. He drops the butt and walks over to his Mazda on a quiet street on a hill. In the distance we see the city of San Francisco.
INT. MAZDA - NIGHT
Nic steps into his Mazda. As the light turns on, we see Lauren is lying in the passenger seat, passed out.
Nic watches her a little closer, is she OK? He shakes her.
NIC
Lauren?
She actually looks a little blue.
NIC (CONT’D)
Lauren?!
He checks a pulse. None. He slaps her face.
NIC (CONT’D)
Lauren!
He panics, searches her phone, finds it, dials 911. Meanwhile tilts the backseat, and starts to do some CPR. Mouth to mouth. Chest compressions.
NIC (CONT’D)
(in phone)
Hello. Yeah, I’m with a friend. She just OD’d. I need an ambulance. We need some help!
87.
911 VOICE (O.S.)
Sir, do you know CPR?
NIC
I’m doing it. Please come quick.
You have to send an ambulance.
911 VOICE (O.S.)
What is your location?
NIC
I don’t know. Trace the call.
Nic drops the phone, keeps on doing chest compressions. All of a sudden:
Lauren gasps, and jerks awake. She blinks twice and bursts into tears.
Nic is relieved. He holds her.
EXT. PORTRERO HILL, SF - NIGHT
An ambulance has now arrived and routine examinations have been done.
EMT
We need to take you to the ER.
LAUREN
I don’t want to. I’m fine.
EMT
(firm)
We need to take you to the ER.
NIC
Can’t you hear what she’s saying?
She doesn’t want to go.
EMT
Otherwise I need to inform the
police. Up to you.
NIC
Godammit.
Nic and Lauren look at each other. They don’t want police.
LAUREN
You’re going to come meet me right?
You promise?
88.
NIC
Yes.
Nic nods. Lauren is crying.
LAUREN
I love you. Come get me, Nic.
NIC
I love you too.
LAUREN
Please come get me. You promise?
Nic gets angry.
NIC
Yes I said I will! What do you
fucking want from me?
Nic can’t look Lauren in the eyes. This is the end, but Lauren is too fucked up to see that.
CUT TO:
The ambulance drives off. Nic feels miserable. Worn out, fucked up, done. Nic still has Lauren’s phone. He dials a number. It’s ringing.
DAVID (O.S.)
David Sheff... 
NIC
Hey dad. It’s me.
DAVID (O.S.)
Nic.
Nic is crying. Standing in the middle of the street.
NIC
Please don’t hate me, dad. I know what I did wrong. I...  Listen, I want to stop. But please, please, please no rehab. Let me come home. I realized I actually need to be home. You guys will give me the strength to stop. Alright?
A beat.
DAVID (O.S.)
That’s not going to happen.
89.
INTERCUT WITH INT. LIVING ROOM, SHEFF HOUSE - NIGHT
David is seated on the edge of the couch.
This breaks David’s heart.
DAVID
I wish I could help, but I can't do that. I can’t.
NIC
Please help me dad. I just need a
little bit of help.
(crying, pleading)
Please help me. I want to come
home.
DAVID
All I can tell you is what you
already know. Call your sponsor.
NIC
I don’t want to talk to my sponsor.
I want to talk to you.
DAVID
Get help. I love you and I hope you get your life together.
NIC
I love you too.
David hangs up.
We stay on David’s face for a while.
EXT. PORTRERO HILL, SF - NIGHT
Nic looks out at the city. Alone.
INT. DAVID'S STUDY, SHEFF HOUSE - NIGHT
David enters his study. It’s a mess, papers everywhere. Books, printouts, etc. He starts cleaning up his desk. Makes it all neat and tidy.
He looks around and watches the pictures hanging on the wall. We’ve seen them a couple of times now. David walks to the wall.
Looks at the picture of him and Nic, 12 years old, both in wetsuits.
90.
He takes it down. He then takes down a couple of other pictures with Nic in them too. He steps to his desk, opens a lower-down desk drawer. He puts the photos in there. He closes the drawer.
He walks out and switches the light off.
EXT. BEAR VALLEY TRAIL, ARCH ROCK - DAY
David, Karen, Daisy and Jasper together with ANOTHER FAMILY WITH KIDS are walking over the Bear Valley Trail.
They arrive near the ocean. It’s really beautiful. Daisy, Jasper and the other kids are playing pretty wild, running and jumping. As they arrive closer to the edge of the cliffs Karen is a little worried about it, but she let’s them be. David too.
David’s phone buzzes. Caller ID says ‘Vicki’.
David distances himself a little from the rest of the gang and takes the call.
INTERCUT WITH INT. HOUSE VICKI LA - DAY
DAVID
Hello?
VICKI
Nicolas called. He sounds desperate. He is going to die if we don’t do anything.
David takes a deep breath.
DAVID
And he’s going to die even if we
do. Nothing we do has any
effect on him.
A beat. Karen looks back at David.
DAVID (CONT’D)
I failed.
VICKI
I know you feel ashamed. OK? So do
I.
Silence.
91.
Vicki takes a deep breath and starts talking, takes her time to make her point.
VICKI (CONT’D)
But you have done great, David. And Karen too. So thank you for that. You were up for it, when I wasn’t. And I’m not giving up now. Never. But I can’t do this alone. I need your help.
David thinks about it. It hurts.
DAVID
I don’t think you can save people,
Vicki.
A beat.
VICKI
No, but you can be there for them.
Can’t you?
David let’s it sink in, breathes heavily. He watches Karen and the other couple. He watches the cliffs and the rocks and the ocean.
DAVID
I’m done. OK?
Vicki is crying. Crushed. She hangs up.
INT. CAFFE TRIESTE - DUSK
Nic sits in Caffe Trieste, again. He is writing some stuff in a notebook. His eyes look like he has cried for hours.
INT. AL-ANON MEETING, CHURCH BASEMENT - NIGHT
David and Karen enter a dingy room. Neon tubes flicker, a fan is ticking in a corner. A dozen people are there, serving themselves coffee and donuts.
The meeting is called to order, people take seats in plastic chairs set in a circle. David and Karen too.
We see people talking, but don’t hear them. David and Karen are listening while also checking out the people. What to think of this? Do they belong there?
92.
David reads an AL ANON sign that reads the AL ANON THREE C’s: ‘You didn’t cause it, you can’t cure it, you can’t control it.’
CUT TO:
Mid-meeting.
MEETING LEADER
Rose, would you like to share?
A woman, clearly distraught, sits up straighter in her seat.
ROSE
Thank you. I’m Rose.
THE GROUP
Hi, Rose.
ROSE
I, well...  I had a rough week. Some of you know, some of you don’t. I lost my Frances this week -
- a real gasp of dismay in the room -
ROSE (CONT’D)
-	she died of an overdose on Sunday.
She herself alternates between being very matter-of-fact and having great trouble holding it together.
ROSE (CONT’D)
I guess that means I’m in mourning. But I realized something else. I’ve actually been in mourning for years. Cos even when she was alive, she wasn’t there.
Her friends continue to stroke her. Some PEOPLE are in tears.
David is listening but not looking. Karen closes her eyes.
INTERCUT WITH:
INT. CAFFE TRIESTE - NIGHT
Nic stops writing, gets up and walks to the bathroom. He leaves his notebook on the table.
93.
INT. AL-ANON MEETING, CHURCH BASEMENT - NIGHT
Rose continues.
ROSE
You mourn for the living. That’s a hard way to live. So in a way, it’s better, I guess. She was a dear, dear young woman. I always felt I needed to stay strong. There’d be some future event, and I’d need all my strength for it. But there are no events after this one. I hope she’s not in pain now. Oh, my Frances.
And now Rose weeps, and weeps. It’s a full-fledged weeping, the kind you don’t often see, even in meetings. But the room just lets it happen. Lets it flow. Lets her be.
David takes Karen’s hand. Karen let’s it happen. She’s cried, she doesn’t look at David.
INT. CAFFE TRIESTE
Nic’s injecting himself in the bathroom.
As it comes on it’s not slow motion, but it might as well be.
Nic, jaws slack, eyes closed, unfurls backwards in his own SLOW-MO. In a beautiful, haunted arc of ballet he fully reclines, until his head slowly touches the ground as if it’s a feather-down mattress. PEACE descends. His lips are turning blue.
INT. CAR / WINDING ROADS INVERNESS - DAWN
David is driving the winding roads. As he drives through the woods it’s pretty dark outside. Focusing on the road, he looks blank-faced. Frozen. Conflicted.
As he takes a turn, and exits the woods, he arrives in an open valley, where the sun manages to shine its first rays of light. He watches the gentle hills of Marin.
INT. HALLWAY, RECOVERY HOUSE - DAY
David walks into a white hallway.
94.
INT. WAITING ROOM, RECOVERY HOUSE - DAY
David sees Vicki sitting in a chair.
DAVID
Hey.
VICKI
Hi.
They hug. Holding on for an extra beat before letting go.
DAVID
How is he doing?
VICKI
The doctor is with him right now.
She chuckles.
VICKI (CONT’D)
He said it’s close to a miracle
that Nic survived, with all the
drugs in his body.
David breathes deep in, and out again. Looks at Vicki. Takes her hand and holds it for a moment.
INT. CORRIDOR, RECOVERY HOUSE - DAY
David supports Nic under one arm as they trundle along a corridor.
Nic holding onto David with one arm. From behind, it looks like the way a younger man would support his frail, doddering father. But it’s the opposite.
EXT. COURTYARD - DAY
David and Nic sit on plastic chairs in a nondescript empty inner courtyard with a view onto the back of a blank wall that’s evidently not been painted in twenty years.
Side-by-side, looking at the small pebbled courtyard with its sickly potted palms.
They look at each other. Nic tries to smile. But starts crying. A little later David too. David hugs Nic.
FADE TO BLACK.
