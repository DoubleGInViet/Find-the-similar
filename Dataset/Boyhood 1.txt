EXT.	OUTSIDE SCHOOL - DAY

MASON waits outside his elementary school, laying in the grass staring up at the clouds. In the distance, the school door opens and Mason's MOM, Olivia, walks toward him.

MOM
Hey, love bug.	You ready?

He is quickly on his feet and they are walking toward the car.

MASON
Yeah.	Hey, guess what, Mom?

MOM
What?

MASON
I figured out where wasps come from.

MOM
Oh, yeah?	Where?

MASON
Well, I think it must be if you flick a rock into the air just right, it'll turn into a wasp.

MOM
Dang...

MASON
Yep.

MOM
That's cool.

INT. CAR - DAY

Driving...

MOM
So how was your day at school?

MASON
Fine.

MOM
Hey, I had a good meeting with Miss Butler this time. I kinda liked her.

MASON
What did she say?
 
2.

MOM
Well... she said that you weren't turning in your homework assignments. And I told her, "I know he does them, 'cause I check them every night." She said she found a big chunk of them crumpled up at the bottom of your backpack.

MASON
She didn't ask for 'em.

MOM
Well, baby, she doesn't have to.
You're supposed to turn them in.
And she said you're still staring

out the window all day.

MASON
Not all day.

MOM
And she said that you destroyed her pencil sharpener.

MASON
Not on purpose.

MOM
Wait, she said that you crammed a

bunch of rocks in it.

MASON
I thought if it could sharpen pencils, maybe we could sharpen rocks.

MOM
(stifling laugh)

Well, what were you gonna do with a bunch of sharpened rocks?

MASON
I was trying to make arrowheads for my rock collection.

MOM
Hm.

She glances back at him, with an understanding sigh.

EXT. HOUSE/DITCH - DAY

Mason rides his bike across the front yard and heads down the street. Soon he and his friend TOMMY are riding down the embankment of a large drainage ditch.
 
3.

EXT. DITCH - DAY

Mason runs up, as Tommy is spray-painting a drawing on the concrete wall of the drainage ditch.

MASON
Dude, when's my turn?

TOMMY
I don't know.

Tommy hands Mason the can of spray paint. Mason begins to spray-paint a letter on the wall.

SAMANTHA (O.S.)
(calling out)

...Maaason.

TOMMY
Samantha!

SAMANTHA
Oh!	Tommy!	Is Mason down there?

TOMMY
Yeah.

SAMANTHA
Well, tell him he has to come home for dinner.

TOMMY	(O.S.)
Okay.

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Mason lays on the floor watching a cartoon.

There's a knock at the door, and Mom comes out to answer it.
It's TED.

MOM
Hey.

TED
Hey, sweetie.	Why aren't you ready?
Hey, Mason.

MASON
Hey, Ted.

TED
Come on, come on, hurry up. Let's go.
 
4.

MOM
What time is it?

TED
It's nine.	Let's go, let's go.

MOM
Okay, I meant to call you, 'cause
Janice flaked out. I don't have a

sitter.

TED
Why didn't you call somebody else?

MOM
Well, I can't get a baby-sitter now, it's nine o'clock. But you're welcome to hang out with us.

TED
Well, no.	I mean we have plans.
The guys are expecting me.

MOM
Well... you can go.

TED	(O.S.)
All right. Yeah, well, I'll come back in a couple of hours. Is that okay?

MOM
Yeah.	Yes.

TED
All right.

MOM
It's okay.

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

The kids lie on either side of Mom, as she reads a story aloud to them.

MOM
(Reading)

"Turn back! Turn back! I don't wanna talk to Moaning Myrtle." "Who?" said Harry as they backtracked quickly. "She haunts one of the toilets in the girls bathroom on the first floor," said Hermione. "She haunts a toilet?"

(MORE)
 
5.

MOM (CONT'D)
"Yes, it's been out of order all year because she keeps having tantrums and flooding the place."

"I never went in there anyway if I could avoid it. It's awful trying to have a pee with her wailing at you."

INT. BEDROOM - LATER

Mason lies awake in bed listening to his mother argue with Ted.

TED	(O.S.)
Why can't you just say that?

MOM	(O.S.)
I'm sorry. I don't want to go with you.

TED	(O.S.)
You're sorry, that's bullshit!

MOM	(O.S.)
That's right, I wanna stay here with my kids. That's what I'd rather do.

TED	(O.S.)
All right.	Would you stop using
your kids as an excuse?!

MOM	(O.S.)
I'm not using my kids as an excuse!

You don't even know--

TED (O.S.)
I know you have to stay here with

your kids!	You're acting--

MOM	(O.S.)
You have this immature life--

TED	(O.S.)
And why do I always-- Why--

MOM	(O.S.)
You have no responsibility.

TED (O.S.)
I have an immature life! I have an immature life?
 
6.

MOM	(O.S.)
And I have responsibilities, okay, you don't know what it's like to be a parent.

TED	(O.S.)
No, I don't! And why am I responsible for your mistakes in life?

MOM	(O.S.)
If you had any idea.	You don't think
I	wouldn't--

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Mason peeks around the corner to watch as the argument continues.

MOM
Don't call my kids mistakes!	Don't!

TED
I'm not responsible for your life choic-- I didn't call your kids--

MOM
You said, "Your respons-- your mistakes in your life," pointing at my kids.

TED
I know what I said, you know what, and immediately you use your kids again.

Mason peeks through the doorway.

MOM	(O.S.)
This is the reality: I'm a parent!

TED	(O.S.)
That's, that's hysterical.

MOM	(O.S.)
That means responsibility.

TED	(O.S.)
I know you're a parent.

MOM	(O.S.)
I would love to have some time to myself! I would love to just go to a fuckin' movie! You don't think I'd like that?

(MORE)
 
7.

MOM	(O.S.) (CONT'D)
Go have some dinner, go to a bar! I don't even know what that's like. I was someone's daughter, then I was somebody's fucking mother! Okay, I don't know what that's like.

INT. KID'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

Mason is comfortably asleep. Samantha slowly pulls the pillow out from underneath his head and smacks him with it.

SAMANTHA
(singing)

"Oops, I did it again... I played with your heart. Got lost in the game. Oh baby, baby..."

Mason throws a stuffed animal at her that she deflects.

SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
"Oops, you think I'm in love.	I'm
sent from above.	I'm not that
innocent."

Another stuffed animal.	She continues to sing.

MASON (O.S.)
Stop! Quit it!

SAMANTHA
"You see my problem is this. I'm dreaming away. Wishing that heroes truly exist. I cry watching the day. Can't you see I'm a fool in so many ways..."

MASON
Quit!	Mom!

SAMANTHA
"But to lose all my senses-- that

is..."

He tries to drown out this last bit with a sustained scream.
Soon the door flies open and Mom enters, angry.

MOM
What the hell is going on in here?!

Samantha has instantaneously shifted from singing to crying.

MOM	(O.S.) (CONT'D)
Do you guys know what time it is?
 
8.

SAMANTHA
(through tears/sobs)

He's throwing things at me...

MOM
Mason! Do not throw things at your sister!

MASON
She's faking, she hit me first!!

MOM
Listen, both of you! I am going back to bed. I don't wanna hear another peep out of here for an hour. Go to sleep.

Mom slams the door behind her. Samantha is suddenly fine, almost cheerful.

MASON
(to Samantha)

Faker!

MOM	(O.S.)
Hey!

EXT. HOUSE - DAY

Mason swings on a large outdoor swing, while Tommy sits thumbing through a catalog. Immediately after, we see Mason and Tommy looking through the lingerie section of the catalog together.

MASON
(laughs)

Ohh!

TOMMY
(pointing, giggling)

Look what I found in the street!

MASON
Dude!

TOMMY
I know, right?
(turns page)

Look at those.

MASON
Hm, look at those!
 
9.

BOYS
(giggling)

Ohh!!

EXT. BACKYARD - DAY

Moments later we see Mason having an introspective moment as he gazes upon a deceased bird's carcass in the dirt.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Mom, Samantha, and Mason eat lunch.

MOM
So listen, guys, I wanna talk to you about something, and you might not like this idea at first but... we're moving to Houston.

MASON
When?

MOM
Well, soon. We should be out by the first, so we don't have to pay two rents next month.

SAMANTHA
No, Mother, we're not moving. Nope, nope, sorry Mom. Nope. Nope.

Smack, smack, smack...

MOM
Samantha, I have to go back to college so I can make us a better living.

Smack.

MOM (O.S.) (CONT'D) With this job I can't take care of us the way I'd like to. I can't keep going this way. And Grandma said she'd help us out... and it would be nice to be near her.

SAMANTHA
Fine, Mother. You can do whatever you want but
(shrugs)
We're not moving.

(Smacks)

Mason moves his fork around in his bowl.
 
10.

MASON
What about our friends?

MOM
Oh, baby, we can e-mail them or write. We can come back to visit. And guess what?

She reaches out to touch Samantha's arm.

MOM (CONT'D)
This place that Grandma found us,
you'll each have your own room.

Right?

Samantha shrugs.

MOM (CONT'D)
And there's a pool.

Samantha shrugs again, clearly not sold on the idea.

INT.	BEDROOM - NIGHT

Mason and Mom are lying on his bed together.

MASON
Mom, do you still love Dad?

MOM
I still love your father... but that doesn't mean it was healthy for us to stay together.

MASON
What if after we move he's trying to find us and he can't?

MOM
Oh, that won't be a problem. He can call Grandma and she'll tell him or he can call Information. We won't be hard to find.

She pushes back his hair lovingly.

MASON
Is he still in Alaska?

MOM
Well, that's what your uncle says.

MASON
Probably taming polar bears or

something.
 
11.

MOM
Yeah... well, I hope they're taming him.

EXT. HOUSE - DAY

The moving van drives off as mom puts another item in the pile of stuff to be left at the curb.

INT. HOUSE - DAY

Mom and Mason are getting ready to paint in the empty bedroom. They're looking at the two lone murals, which look a little odd without the bunk bed in front of them.

MOM
Here, wanna help me out?

MASON
Sure.

MOM
Okay. Take this paint... very carefully... and paint any little smudge or mark or anything on the baseboard there, behind the door, and all around the doorways on the inside.

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

Meanwhile, Samantha is talking on the phone.

SAMANTHA
(on phone)

She says we're gonna come visit and I'm gonna write and call you. Oh, wait, hold on a second. I'm getting another call.
(Pushes Flash)
Hello? Sorry, Tommy, Mason can't come over today. We're moving. And I'm on the other line. Bye.
(Pushes Button)

Althea? I'm gonna be sending Sailor Scout instructions. Email, and write back telling me how the other scouts are doing. Well, because you're the leader now.

During the last bit of this conversation, Mason slowly paints over the "growth chart" lines on the bedroom door jamb.
 
12.

EXT. OUTSIDE FRONT DOOR - DAY

Carrying their final belongings from inside the house, they slowly exit the front door and head over to the car.

MOM
Okay, let's go, 'cause I wanna get there before it gets dark.

SAMANTHA
Goodbye yard, goodbye crepe myrtle, goodbye mailbox. Goodbye box of stuff Mommy won't let us take with us but we don't wanna throw away. Goodbye house, I'll never like mommy as much for making us move.

MOM
Samantha! Why don't you say goodbye to that little horse shit attitude? Okay? 'Cause we're not taking that in the car.

Just before he gets in the car, Mason is looking out at the neighborhood.

MASON
Goodbye old lady who listens to rock music and rides a motorcycle.

Soon the car is pulling away. As they drive off, Mason notices out his side of the car, Tommy approaching on a bike in the distance, gesturing toward the car. Mason watches him out the window, but says nothing as Tommy recedes into the distance.

INT. CAR - DAY

Mason and Samantha are restless and energetic, letting their childish energy get the best of them as they wrestle, hit, and squeal at each other in the back seat of the car. It is all well-intentioned though, as the two share a laugh after Mom tells them to quiet down.

SAMANTHA
Eeeee!	Don't!

MOM
Hey!	Hey, what's happening back
there?	Stop, put the barrier up.

SAMANTHA
Ahh!	Stop!	No!
 
13.

Mason punches the pillow barrier between himself and Samantha, while his Mom speaks.

MOM
Hey, put the pillow between you. Make a barrier, come on. Stop. We're gonna play a game called The Game of Silence. Whoever can stay quiet for the longest period of time wins. You guys think you can do that? Okay, go!

The family's car moves on toward the Houston skyline just as dusk arrives.

INT. BEDROOM - DAY

Mason appears grumpy, trying to shove what he needs for the day into his backpack quickly.

MOM	(O.S.)
The bus'll be here in ten minutes.

MOM (CONT'D)
(steps into doorway)

Put that homework in your backpack!

MOM	(O.S.) (CONT'D)
Go eat!	Baby, go eat!

MASON
I	am!

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Samantha places pancakes on their plates while talking to Mason in a cryptic language, reminiscent of pig latin.

SAMANTHA
...I affatay servay yoohay.

MASON
Speak English! Shut up. Mom! She's speaking that stupid language again!

MOM
Samantha!

SAMANTHA
I was speaking perfectly clear English, Mother. You know, he's a little slow in the head. He did officially flunk first grade.
 
14.

MOM
Sit your butt down.

SAMANTHA
Yes sir, Mother sir!

She salutes.

MOM
All right, listen up guys. Grandma's gonna pick you up after school.

Your dad is in town for the day so you're gonna spend the afternoon with him.

SAMANTHA
Hmm.

MASON
Is he moving back?

MOM
I don't know.

SAMANTHA
We haven't seen him in about eighty years.

MOM
Like... a year and a half.

MASON
(points to Samantha)

Ha-ha.

SAMANTHA
Oh please...

MOM
Can we please eat, here? The bus is coming. Who wants syrup?

INT.	CLASSROOM - DAY

Mason plays Oregon Trail on a classroom computer, while his TEACHER speaks in the background.

TEACHER	(O.S.)
All right, nice cursive. Okay, Mason, when I check the mobiles, am I gonna find yours?

MASON
No.
 
15.

TEACHER
And why not?

MASON
'Cause I didn't finish it.

TEACHER
Well, it's time to finish it.

MASON
Just a minute.

TEACHER
No, let's do Apple Quit.

Mason cuts a sheet of construction paper in the shape of the state of Texas, presumably to finish his mobile. He sits across from a female classmate, GIRL IN RED, who teases him.

GIRL IN RED
Time to finish your work, Mason.

"Apple Quit."

INT.	GRANDMA'S HOUSE - LATER

Samantha sits with her GRANDMA, Catherine, showing off her good grades on various school reports. Mason sits in his own chair, playing with a Gameboy.

SAMANTHA	(O.S.)
So this is my history test...

GRANDMA	(O.S.)
Mm-hm.	A+, very good.

SAMANTHA	(O.S.)
And that's another history test.

GRANDMA	(O.S.)
Mm-hm, and another A.

SAMANTHA
Yeah, well, it doesn't have a plus but... oh well.

GRANDMA
Oh.

Grandma strokes Samantha's hair proudly.

SAMANTHA
And then um, that's my report on

lizards...
 
16.

GRANDMA
Oh, let me see your pictures.

SAMANTHA
And then, um... Oh yeah, these are my pictures.

GRANDMA
What is that?

SAMANTHA
Well, that's called a dewlap.

GRANDMA
A dewlap, okay.

SAMANTHA
Oh yeah, this is a math test.

GRANDMA
Oh, "A" again.

Mason reaches into candy dish on the table.

GRANDMA (CONT'D)
Mase, that's the last candy, okay?

MASON
Okay.

GRANDMA	(O.S.)
Okay.	We need to put this stuff up.

EXT.	STREET/FRONT PORCH - DAY

A Pontiac GTO pulls up outside.

GRANDMA	(O.S.)
That's him.

DAD gets out of the car and hurries to the door. Samantha squeals, as she runs out to greet him.

SAMANTHA
Daddy!	Hi!

DAD
Oh my!	Look at you, you're so big!

He hugs them both.

DAD (CONT'D)
Hey, MJ!	What's happening, buddy?
Are you guys ready to have some fun?
 
17.

MASON AND SAMANTHA
Yeah!!

DAD
Yeah! Alright. Hey, Catherine, how are you?

GRANDMA
Mase.	I'm good.

DAD
Good to see you.

GRANDMA	(O.S.)
Yeah.

DAD
What time should I have these rascals back?

GRANDMA	(O.S.)
Oh, I don't know, around 7:30, I guess. I gotta get 'em home by 8:00.

DAD
Aw, you know what, why don't I take them over to their mom's?

A moment of tension passes between them.

GRANDMA
No, that's okay.	She's expecting
me.

DAD
Oh no, that's alright.	You guys
know where it is, don't you?

SAMANTHA
Mm.	Yeah.

DAD
All right, I'll do it.	It's no
problem.

GRANDMA
I don't think that's such a good

idea.

DAD
Look, it's no problem.	Alright?

GRANDMA
(rolls her eyes)

Okay...
 
18.

DAD
You guys ready to go?

MASON AND SAMANTHA
Yeah!

DAD
Let's do it, go!

GRANDMA	(O.S.)
Whoa. Wait a minute, you gotta get your stuff.

SAMANTHA
Oh yeah.

GRANDMA
You got backpacks, your purse.

Homework.	Go to the bathroom.

DAD
Can't believe how big they are.

GRANDMA
Yeah.	Time is goin' by.

DAD
Mm.	Must be nice for you, having
'em here in Houston.

GRANDMA
I love it, yeah. I'm volunteering at their school.

DAD
Oh yeah?	What you doin' over there?

GRANDMA
I'm in the library. You know, reading to the little ones.

DAD
Huh.	Great.

GRANDMA
So -- Alaska, huh?

DAD
Yeah.

GRANDMA
Are you back?

DAD
We'll see.	How's Liv?
 
19.

GRANDMA
She's a busy girl. Yeah. She's back in school. But she's working, and single parenting... a lot to juggle.

DAD
You guys got everything, huh?

MASON AND SAMANTHA
Yeah.

DAD
Alright, say goodbye to your

grandmother.

MASON (O.S.)
Bye!

SAMANTHA	(O.S.)
Bye grandma!

DAD
Alright, let's roll. Now wait a second. You're not the type of kids who like presents, are ya?

SAMANTHA
Yes!

DAD
Naw, you don't --

MASON
Yeah!

SAMANTHA
'Course we are!

DAD
Really?	Let's do it!

MASON AND SAMANTHA
Yeah!	Yay!

MASON
I call front seat!

SAMANTHA
I wanted the front seat, though.

DAD
Alright. Well, Mason gets it on the way there and Samantha gets it on the way back, huh? Hop in there.
 
20.

GRANDMA	(O.S.)
Seat belts!

DAD
Seat belts.	Alright.

He motions to Grandma that he's got it covered.

DAD (CONT'D)
Seat belts. Not like this car has any seat belts.

INT.	BOWLING ALLEY - LATER

Samantha is bowling, her pink ball hurdling down the lane toward the pins.

DAD (O.S.)
Nice...	Nice...	Nice...

Strike!

SAMANTHA
Yay!

DAD
Yeah!	Alright!

Dad is clearly impressed and excited for Samantha, as he stands to embrace her.

DAD (CONT'D)
Come here, come here, yes! That was awesome! Get up there Mason, get up there!

SAMANTHA
Daddy!

DAD
(to Samantha)
It was so good!
(to Mason)

Come on. Let 'em know who you are, buddy. Let 'em know who you are.

Dad kisses Samantha.	Mason throws his bowling ball.

DAD (CONT'D)
Yes!	Yes!	Yes!	Alright, alright...

Gutter ball.

DAD (CONT'D)
Don't worry about it.
 
21.

MASON
Wish we could use the bumpers.

DAD
Bumpers are for kids. You know, what're you, two years old? You don't want the bumpers. Life doesn't give you bumpers.

Mason tosses the ball again.

DAD (CONT'D)
There we, there we go, there we go! We got something there! We got something! We got something! Ooooh!

Another gutter ball.

MASON
Last time I went bowling we had bumpers and it was a lot more fun!

Dad gets up to bowl.

DAD
You don't want the bumpers, alright? You bowl a strike with the bumpers and it doesn't mean anything. Trust me. Just lay it out on the lane. One, two, three and...

Samantha mimes smoking, points to Dad, as if to say that he smells of cigarettes. It's Dad's turn to bowl.

DAD (CONT'D)
Ka-blam!	Let's hear it for the
father!	Whoo!
(To Samantha)
Get up there, get in there...

SAMANTHA
Yay!	Great job!

DAD
Get out there, girl, get out there!

Score-keeping screen flashes an animated alligator that reads:
STRIKE

EXT. Street as car burns (on TV screen)

TV NEWSMAN	(V.O.)
Four Blackwater operatives have been viciously attacked in their cars in
(MORE)
 
22.

TV NEWSMAN	(V.O.) (CONT'D)
Fallujah. The bodies and cars were set on fire, after insurgents started shooting, killing American citizens.

DAD	(O.S.)
Look at this.	It's a disaster.

TV NEWSMAN	(V.O.)
But the ambush didn’t end there.
The bodies of the four men were

savagely ripped apart...

INT. BOWLING ALLEY CAFE - EVENING

The family sits around a table enjoying their snacks, while Dad smokes a cigarette.

DAD	(O.S.)
Alright, let me tell you what's
happening in Iraq, alright?	Exactly
what every thinking person in the
world knew was gonna happen before
they got started.	Bush and his little
numb-nut fanatics he's got around
him, they don't give a rat's ass.

SAMANTHA
That's a quarter.

DAD
What's a quarter?

SAMANTHA
You said a-s-s.

DAD
Oh, sorry.	My bad.

SAMANTHA
And my teacher says it's a good war, because it's better to be safe than sorry.

DAD
That's what they're teaching you in school? Alright, listen to me. Listen to your father, okay? That is the lie. That's the big lie. Iraq had nothing to do with what happened at the World Trade Center. You know that, right?

SAMANTHA
I guess.
 
23.

DAD
Alright. Who are you gonna vote for next fall, MJ?

MASON
I don't know.

SAMANTHA
He can't vote.	He's not eighteen.

DAD
Yeah, oh -- alright, who would you vote for?

MASON
Kerry?

DAD
Anybody but Bush!	Okay?

SAMANTHA
Are you gonna move back?

DAD
Uh... I'm plannin' on it.	You know,
I gotta find a job.

MASON
Are you and mom gonna get back

together?

DAD
I don't know.	That's not, uh...
entirely up to me, you know?

SAMANTHA
I remember when I was six, you and mom were fighting like mad. You were yelling so loud and she was crying.

DAD
That's what you remember, huh?

SAMANTHA
Yep.

DAD
You don't remember the trips to Galveston, camping in Big Bend, all the fun we had?

SAMANTHA
Nope.
 
24.

DAD
You ever get mad at your mother?

SAMANTHA
Yeah.

DAD	(O.S.)
You ever get mad at your brother?

SAMANTHA
Yeah.

DAD
Yeah.	You ever yell at him?

SAMANTHA
Oh yeah.

DAD
Yeah. Doesn't mean you don't love him, right?

SAMANTHA
Mmm...

DAD
Look, the same thing happens when
you're grown up, alright?	You...
You know, you get mad at people.

You know, it's not a big deal.

MASON
What'd you do in Alaska?

DAD
I worked on a boat for a while.	Um,

I tried to write some music.

MASON
Did you see any polar bears?

DAD	(O.S.)
No, but I saw a Kodiak bear. It was fuckin' huge.

SAMAMTHA	(O.S.)
Dad! That's fifty cents for the F-word!

Dad reaches into his wallet.

DAD
I'm sorry.	Here, take a dollar,
alright?	Keep the change.
(MORE)
 
25.

DAD (CONT'D)
You guys are gonna be seein' a lot more of me. Okay? I missed you two real bad, while I was gone. Okay, I want you to know that. I just needed to take some time. You know, to... Just... Your mom and me, okay...

Well, your mother, okay, is a piece of work. Alright, I think, I think you know that by now. Alright? And I'm just, I'm so happy to be with the two of you. Okay. And I'm sorry about that bumper business. Alright. I'm gonna get better at stuff like that, okay?

As a token of reconciliation, Dad high fives them both, smiling.

INT.	MASON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Mason shows Dad his collection of arrowheads and a long feather, all laid out on top of a skateboard. Mason describes each of the pieces to his Dad.

MASON
I got that one at Dripping Springs...

DAD	(O.S.)
Mmhmm.

MASON
And um, my friend Rodney gave me

that one.

DAD	(O.S.)
Yeah?

MASON
And I bought that one.

DAD
You bought this one?

MASON
Yeah.

DAD
You found this at Dripping Springs?

MASON
Uh-huh!

DAD
Wow!	What else do you got?
 
26.

MASON
Well, um, these are snake vertebrae.

DAD
Snake vertebrae? That's disgusting. Huh? Mason, I don't want you collecting snake vertebrae anymore.

They both share a laugh.

DAD (CONT'D)
Is this the feather I sent you?

MASON
Yeah!	Yeah, yeah, yeah, it is.

Samantha enters the room carrying photos and a stuffed animal.
She sits down next to Dad, interrupting Mason.

SAMAMTHA
Oh, Dad! Um, I forgot to show you these, um, these basketball pictures.

DAD
You're on a basketball team?

SAMAMTHA
Yeah!

DAD
Wow!	Check you out!

MASON
Yeah, and these are-- these are beaver claws.

DAD
Beaver claws?

SAMANTHA	(O.S.)
I know.	That's me.

DAD	(O.S.)
What, you hunting beaver, huh?

MASON (O.S.)
(laughs)

No.

SAMANTHA
You see, that's McKinney, that's Meg, and that Gem. They're all my friends --
 
27.

MASON
...And this is dried Canadian grass...

DAD
Uh-huh.	What position do you play?

SAMANTHA
Um, guard.

MASON
This is dried Canadian grass... And, and uh...

DAD
Uh-huh.	Wait, you scoring any points?

SAMANTHA
Well, about eight or ten a game.

DAD
Eight or ten a game?	That is awesome!

SAMANTHA
Yeah!

MASON
Once she didn't score any and she

cried!

DAD
You cried?

SAMANTHA
Well, only a little bit.

DAD
Awww.

Dad kisses Samantha's forehead.

INT.	FRONT ENTRY - MOMENTS LATER

MOM
Hello!

SAMANTHA
Oh, Mason, Mom's home!

MASON
Mom's home!

Dad quickly shifts from playful to nervous.

DAD
Hey, Mom's home.
 
28.

SAMANTHA
Mom, hi!

MOM
Hey.

SAMANTHA
Oh, look at this owl Daddy gave me! Isn't it cool? See, its head spins! And look at this bracelet! It was made by Indians in Alaska.

MASON
And Mom, Daddy made this cool hand carved grizzly bear and this tiki.

MOM
It's a totem.	Wow.

SAMANTHA
And guess what else? We went bowling and I made four strikes!

MASON
Yeah, and we got to ride around in

Dad's car!

MOM	(O.S.)
Wow.

DAD
Hey, Liv.

MOM
Hey.

DAD
I know you wanted me to drop them off at your mom's. I just thought it'd be easier if I brought 'em over here.

MOM
Well, it really screwed up my plans.

MASON
Well, we just wanted to show him our rooms.

SAMANTHA
Yeah.

MOM
Did you guys eat anything?
 
29.

SAMANTHA
Well, we had some french fries at

the bowling alley.

MOM
Did you do your homework or...

MASON
No.

SAMANTHA
Not yet.

MOM
Okay. Can I talk to you outside for a second?

DAD
Yeah.	Sure.
(as he exits)

They had more than french fries.

The children scramble to find a suitable spot for eavesdropping but their parents are inaudible.

INT.	UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Samantha and Mason look out the window, down at their parents having an argument below.

MASON
Do you think he's gonna spend the

night?

SAMANTHA	(O.S.)
Doesn't look like it.

Mom walks away from Dad. He stands there for a beat, then saunters off. The kids are visibly disappointed.

EXT.	COLLEGE - DAY

Mason and Mom walk across the campus lawn.

INT. COLLEGE CLASSROOM - DAY

A professor, BILL, lectures to the class. Mason and Mom are seated in the classroom audience.

BILL	(V.O.)
Okay. An unconditioned stimulus, something that produces an unlearned, involuntary, unconditioned response.
(MORE)
 
30.

BILL (V.O.) (CONT'D) Now in Pavlov's experiment, what was the stimulus, that he used? Come on now, people! Tough weekend? What's the deal, here? Meat. Right? Meat. Meat powder, actually. Whatever meat powder is, it worked on this dog. Okay. He put the meat powder in there and it produced an unconditioned response in the dog, which was? Salivation. Alright. Now, who can give me another example of an unconditioned stimulus-response pair that happens to you everyday. It's probably happening to some of you right now.
(pause)

How about sex? Sure, you know. You see an attractive member of the opposite gender, you have an automatic response. You don't have to think about it. Mick Jagger wrote a song about... Oh, when they call your name, I salivate like a Pavlov dog.

Class laughs.

BILL (CONT'D)
Thank you very much.	Class dismissed.

Students leave, as Mason and Mom approach the professor.

MOM	(O.S.)
Doctor Welbrock, this is my son Mason.

BILL
Ohh.

MOM
Mason, this is Dr. Welbrock.

BILL
Your son. Now see, I thought this was a boy genius who was taking my college course.

Mason laughs.	He and Bill shake hands.

MOM
He wasn't feeling well today, so I thought I'd bring him with me.

Bill touches Mason's forehead.
 
31.

BILL
Ah! No fever. It's a con job. I can tell because I have a nine year old son, he pulls this all the time. Same kind of deal. Hey, you play soccer?

MASON
Mm, no.

BILL
Neither does my boy. He hates soccer. He likes computers. My 11-year-old daughter, loves soccer. Who can figure? Hey, maybe we can get all you guys together sometime, huh?

MOM
Maybe, yeah.	Well, you ready to go?

MASON
Yeah.

BILL
Nice to meet you, Mason.

MASON
Nice to meet you, too.

BILL
And thanks for coming to my class.

Mason walks ahead of them as Olivia and Bill speak a little more intimately. It's clear that they have more than just a professor-student relationship. Mason notices a bit of this and looks on, confused.

BILL (CONT'D)
Olivia.

MOM
Hm?

BILL
Nice kid.

MOM
Thanks.

BILL
So you think, uh, Grandma might be available for a little baby-sitting?
 
32.

MOM	(O.S.)
(giggles)

Maybe.

BILL
Really?	Well, great.

EXT.	BACKYARD - DAY

Mason and Samantha play an outdoor trampoline game with Randy and Mindy, their new stepbrother and stepsister. They are in the big backyard of their new home, where Dr. Welbrock and his children have lived.

GRANDMA
Hey kids, they're here!

KIDS
Oh, they're home, they're home!

GRANDMA
Hurry!	Hurry!

They all scramble inside and quickly assemble for a big welcome home ceremony in the front entryway. A sign reads, "Welcome Home Honeymooners, We Love You Mom & Dad". Olivia and Bill open the door to enter the house.

MOM
Hey!

KIDS
Mom!	Daddy!

BILL
Oh!	We're here!	Hey, we've returned!

Hugs all around. The family talks over one another. Bill notices the "Welcome Home" sign the kids made.

SAMANTHA AND MASON
Hi Dad!

BILL
Samantha, Mason, look -- Thank you.

That's very nice.

MOM
(to Randy and Mindy)

Hey guys!

The group all speaks at once.
 
33.

BILL
(To Grandma)

Hi, Mom.	How are you?

SAMANTHA	(O.S.)
Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom!	Look at the
sign we made!

BILL
(To Grandma)

They give you any trouble?

MINDY
Samantha and I made it all ourselves.

BILL	(O.S.)
I know the boys helped you with that a lot.

MINDY
No, not at all!

The group continues to speak at once.

BILL
That's good...	Oh, pass out the
goodies.

Mom passes out a bag of presents to each of the kids.

MOM
This is for the girls, this is for the girls...

BILL
(to Grandma)

Don't worry, we got you some absinthe or something.

GRANDMA
Oh, let's pour it.

INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

The family sits around the table, swapping fun stories and pictures from their time apart.

MOM
You take this big elevator up, and when we got to the top, we flew a paper airplane off.

RANDY (O.S.)
And what happened?
 
34.

MOM	(O.S.)
It flew!

BILL	(O.S.)
It flew away.	It went for miles.
Went onto the Arctic Trail.

They laugh.

SAMANTHA
Oh, did you guys kiss under the Bridge of Sighs?

MOM
Yes.

BILL
Yes, we did.

Bill leans in to kiss Olivia.

MINDY
Hey, Mom, can we see your wedding

ring?

MOM	(O.S.)
Oh, sure.

Mom hands over her wedding ring. The boys look at a 20 Questions game.

MINDY	(O.S.)
(Eyeing the ring)

Wow.

SAMANTHA	(O.S.)
(Holding the ring)

Technically that's a fancy step cut surrounded by miniature brilliant.

MASON
I wish we could've gone to Europe.

RANDY
Yeah.

BILL
Yeah, we'll go as a family next time.

But you didn't miss much, really. We just stayed in the hotel room the whole time playing video games.

Mom laughs.
 
35.

MASON
Really?

BILL
And the hotels are really small and really old. Squeaky.

The WAITER comes over.

WAITER
Can I get you anything else? Would you like to see a dessert menu?

BILL
(To Randy)
Listen, I told you to put that away.
(To Mom)

Would you put that in your purse, please? Computer games at the table.
(To Waiter)

Yes, uh, please, another bottle of wine.

MASON
(to Waiter)

Um, Coke.

MOM
Um, you know what?	Mason, you're
okay with water.	No more Cokes.
(to Waiter)
Thank you.

BILL	(O.S.)
(To Randy)

Now how 'bout you? Did you finish your science project?

RANDY
Not quite yet.

BILL
Well, did you work on it? I mean, did you build anything, or plan anything, or..?

RANDY
A little.

BILL
(to Mindy)

Did he work on it at all, Mindy?

MINDY
No.
 
36.

BILL
(to Mindy)

Did he sit around playing video games with Mason the whole time?

MINDY
(laughs)

Yeah.

BILL
Mm.	You were supposed to finish
that by the time I got back.

Remember?	Hey.

EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - DAY

Our gang of kids, plus two more (NEIGHBORHOOD BOY and NEIGHBORHOOD GIRL) walk home from school together. The boys walk in a pack slightly in front of the girls.

NEIGHBORHOOD BOY
Grievous is the best, man.

MASON
Yoda!	Yoda, man.

RANDY
No, Yoda is!

MASON AND RANDY
Yoda!

NEIGHBORHOOD BOY
He has four arms.

MASON
Yoda!	Represent.

MINDY
I hate Ms. Billingsly. Everybody's been saying she's lesbian.

NEIGHBORHOOD GIRL
She is.	She hit on Stacy.

MINDY
Man, that's gross.

SAMANTHA
Think it's true?

NEIGHBORHOOD GIRL
She's always walking in the locker

room.
 
37.

RANDY
I think I still have a couple of

those--

PAUL, overly large/mentally impaired neighborhood teen they seem familiar with, walks by awkwardly bouncing a basketball.

NEIGHBORHOOD BOY (O.S.)
Hey, Paul.	Tell us a joke.

PAUL
Damn.	Fuck.	Go to hell.	Ass.

The kids look at him quizzically and keep walking.

INT. BEDROOM - LATER

Mason and Randy are playing a video game.

MASON
Uh!	Blew you up.

RANDY
Aw heck, man.	That was not fair.

MASON
No, actually it was.	That's like
the fairest thing ever.

RANDY
Ugh.

MASON
Oh, once again I take you down.

INT. FAMILY ROOM - DAY

Samantha and Mindy sit with Mom on the sofa, laughing, while Mason and Randy sit opposite them. Bill is up first, as the whole family plays charades.

Chicken?	Bird?

Mom and the girls laugh.

BOYS
Second word.
 
38.

RANDY
Um... hood?

MASON
Big hair?	Uh.	Robin Hood!

BILL
(tapping his nose)

Ah!

Mom applauds.

Brilliant child!

Samantha stands to take her turn.

MOM AND MINDY	(O.S.)
Second word.

MINDY	(O.S.)
Blanket?

MASON
Hey, you can't use props!

Samantha turns to smack mason with the blanket.

BILL
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Cut it out. Hey, uh-- Judges speak: No props. No props. Can't use props. You can do it without that. Think, think, think.

MOM (O.S.)
Um, bunch!

MINDY	(O.S.)
Folding?	Is it like...

MOM
The gathered?	Folded.

MINDY
Uh...

The boys laugh.

MINDY (CONT'D)
Messing around with a blanket...

Wrinkling it, uh...
 
39.

MOM
Wrinkling clothes... A Wrinkle In

Time!

Mom and Mindy clap and cheer at their victory.

INT. BOOK RELEASE PARTY - NIGHT

Sign reads: "7-15: Harry Potter and the Half-blood Prince. Magical Midnight Release Party 9PM." The kids are all present, dressed in Harry Potter costumes. They participate in a variety of Harry Potter festivities, beginning with a trivia contest.

BOOK TRIVIA JUDGE
What are the guards at Azkaban?

Samantha rings the bell first, as Mason fumbles for the correct answer.

SAMANTHA
Dementors!

Samantha got it right.
