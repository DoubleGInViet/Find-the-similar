How 'bout the dusting, Sam?

SAMANTHA
I haven't done that yet.

BILL
Well, I saw you working on your art project. You mean you had time to finish your little art project but you didn't have time to finish your chores? I thought we talked about that.

MINDY
Dad, it's fine.	I can finish the

The biological father who I spend every other week with and I make polite conversation, you know, while he drives me places and buys me shit. No! Talk to me.

He turns to Samantha in the passenger seat.

DAD (CONT'D)
Samantha, how was your week? Uh, I don't know Dad, it was kind of tough. Billy and Ellen broke up, and Ellen's kind of mad at me because she saw me talking to Billy in the cafeteria. And you remember that sculpture I was working on? Well, it was a unicorn and the horn broke off. So, now it's zebra. Okay? But I still think I'm going to get an 'A'. Alright?

Dad turns around to address Mason in the back seat.

DAD (CONT'D)
Mason, uh, how was your week? Well Dad, you know it was kind of tough. Joe, he's kind of a jerk, actually. He stole some cigarettes from his mom and he wanted me to smoke 'em. But I said no, cause I knew what a hard time you had quittin' smokin', Dad. How 'bout that? Is that so hard?
 
48.

SAMANTHA
Dad, these questions are kind of

hard to answer.

DAD
What is so hard to answer about what sculpture are you making?

SAMANTHA
It's abstract.

DAD
Okay. Okay, that's good. See, that's, I didn't know that. I didn't know you were even interested in abstract art.

SAMANTHA
I'm not.	They make us do it.

MASON
But Dad, I mean why is it all on us though? You know, what about you? How was your week? You know, who do hang out with? Do you have a girlfriend? What have you been up to?

DAD
I see your point.

Mason smiles.

DAD (CONT'D)
So we should just let it happen more natural, right? That's what you're sayin', right?

Okay. That's what we'll do. Starting now.

BILL
Where the hell have you been?

MOM
I'm leaving you, Bill. We're moving out.

BILL

MOM
Samantha and Mason!	Come down!

BILL
No, mm-mm, don't think so. Oh, who's this?

CAROL
I'm not here for you!

BILL
Oh, really? Oh, I know, you're here to protect my wife from me. Well, thank you so much, you two.

He reaches towards her.

Okay, stay back!	Now behave!

BILL
Why don't you come inside here, huh?
Come inside here.
(To Samantha and Mason)

Where the hell are you goin'? Get your ass upstairs, you're not goin' anywhere.

MOM
Stop!
(to Samantha and Mason)

Come on!

BILL
Where the hell do you think you're going?

Bill notices Randy and Mindy listening.

BILL (CONT'D)
Get upstairs!	What the hell--

MOM
Hey!

BILL
Nobody's going anywhere, goddamnit.

MOM
Stop it!

BILL
No, goddamnit!

Bill moves to block them from leaving the house with his arm.

MOM
Don't touch my kids!

BILL
Alright, take 'em.	Go on, go on.

MOM
Don't touch them!

BILL
Take 'em!

CAROL
Come on. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

SAMANTHA
Where are we going?

We're going to stay with Carol and her family for a while.

CAROL (O.S.)
It's gonna be okay.

INT.	CAROL'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Mason and Carol's son, LEE, play a boxing game on Nintendo Wii, while her daughter, ABBY, sings in the background. Mom brings the boys a snack.

MOM
Hey, Lee and Mason.	Take a break.
Here's a snack.

Abby continues to sing.	The room is tense.

CAROL
Hey, Abby, why don't you come help me with this, huh?

SAMANTHA
Why couldn't Randy and Mindy come

with us?
 
69.

MOM
I'm not their legal guardian, honey. That would be kidnapping. I can't just...

SAMANTHA
Well, what's gonna happen to them? What happens when their legal guardian is dangerous and abusive?

MOM
You know, I don't know honey. I called their mom. I called the Child Protective Services. You know, I have you and your brother. We were in a dangerous situation. You're my responsibility.

SAMANTHA
Are we ever gonna see them again?

MOM
I don't know.	And I hope so.

SAMANTHA
How much longer are we gonna be here?

Mom fights back tears.

MOM
Not long.	We're...
(starts crying)

Oh, I don't -- I don't know. I don't have the answer to everything.

CAROL
Hey, listen. We are happy to have you here as long as you want. As long as you need. This is fun for us, isn't it?

ABBY
Mm-hmm.

CAROL
Yeah, it's like having a big sister?

Like having a brother.

MOM
We're gonna help out, right? You're not even gonna know we're here.

CAROL
Okay.
 
70.

EXT.	SCHOOL - DAY

Mom pulls up to drop Samantha off at the front doors of her new Junior High School.

SAMANTHA
Mom, this is awful. You're dumping me in some parking lot of this school where I don't even know anyone! I'm leaving all my friends and I didn't even get to say goodbye! I don't know where to go!

MOM
Okay, Samantha. You go right through that door. The office is right there. They're expecting you, they're gonna give you your schedule. Here's your lunch money. I will pick you up right here at 3:30.

SAMANTHA
I'm wearing dirty clothes! Because you wouldn't even let us get our stuff! We don't even have a place to live! This sucks!

Samantha gets out of the car, slamming the door behind her.
Mom screams out of the window as she walks away.

MOM
Samantha... I'm doing the best I can! And you're right, it sucks! But it doesn't suck half as much as having a drunk fool slam your head against a wall! So cut your horseshit attitude.

Mom turns to Mason in the back as he climbs toward the front seat.

MOM (CONT'D)
Put your seat belt on!

INT.	SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

Mom is walking Mason to his class.

MOM
You know if you need anything I'm in room 112, right?

Mason nods.

MOM (CONT'D)
Okay.	This is Mrs. Darby's room.
Oh, honey, it's gonna be okay.	Okay?

Mom...

Mason walks away, embarrassed at her public affection.

Hi!	Are you Mason?

Yeah.

MRS. DARBY
Hi. I'm Mrs. Darby. I'm glad to meet you. Why don't you sit here?
(to Kenny)

Kenny!	Off!

Kenny climbs down from on top of his desk and takes his seat.

KENNY
Yes ma'am.

MRS. DARBY
Kenny. This is Mason and I want you to show him around today, okay?

KENNY
Got it.

MRS. DARBY
Okay.

KENNY
Hey dude.	Welcome to the suck.

The boys trade a casual low five and exchange a smile.

MRS. DARBY	(O.S.)
Everybody, listen up.	We have a new

row.

(MORE)

EXT.	NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - DAY

Mason pushes an Obama/Biden campaign sign into the ground, before he and Samantha walk across the street. Samantha waits in the street with more signs, while Mason knocks on the RESIDENT's front door.

RESIDENT	(O.S.)
What?

The white-haired Resident is standing to Mason's right, beneath his carport.

MASON
Oh, hi. Can I put an Obama sign in your yard?

RESIDENT
Do I look like a Barack Hussein Obama supporter?

Mason shrugs.

RESIDENT (CONT'D)
No.

Mason turns to leave.

RESIDENT (CONT'D)
This is private property.	Get off.
I could shoot you!

He rejoins Samantha at the street.

house.

EXT.	NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - MOMENTS LATER

Samantha is now talking to a young, BLONDE HOUSEWIFE.

BLONDE HOUSEWIFE
I love it!

(MORE)

BLONDE HOUSEWIFE (CONT'D) Young Obama supporters out on the trail. This is great! Are you doing this through your school?

SAMANTHA
Um.	Our dad's a big supporter.

BLONDE HOUSEWIFE
Oh, that's great.	I mean, we've
just got to pull together to get

this win, right?

SAMANTHA
Yeah.

BLONDE HOUSEWIFE
Oh, I just love him so much. I mean I have these dreams where I'm just kissing him because I just love him so much! He's so cute, isn't he?

SAMANTHA
(laughs)

Yeah.

BLONDE HOUSEWIFE
Do you know, I made these t-shirts for my kids. "My Momma's for Obama!" Do you like it? It's good, right? Yeah.

Samantha turns to walk towards the street.

BLONDE HOUSEWIFE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
Thanks for the sign!

SAMANTHA (O.S.)
No problem.

Dad pulls up in his car, arriving to pick them up.

DAD
Hey, alright! Looks good! How many you got left, two? Alright, alright, we're done. Let's get out of here. Come on, Sam.

Dad spots a McCain sign in the front yard across the street.

DAD (CONT'D)
(to Mason)

Go get that McCain sign, would you?
 
74.

MASON
(hesitating)

What?

DAD
Get the McCain sign! Go rip it up, come on! Get it, get it, get it... Go! Go! Go!

Mason runs across the street to grab the sign.

DAD (CONT'D)
Good job, buddy.	Yeah.	Proud of
you, son.

Dad closes the stolen sign into the trunk of his car, before the three of them drive off down the street.

SAMANTHA
You guys are gonna get us arrested.

DAD
Hey, look. I'm a patriot, alright? Sometimes in this life, you gotta fight.

INT.	BOWLING ALLEY CAFE - EVENING

They sit around a table talking.

DAD	(O.S.)
And what is it that you do at these parties?

SAMANTHA
I don't know... talk, dance, listen to music.

DAD
Uh-huh.	And that's more fun to you
than going camping with your brother

and your father who love you?

SAMANTHA
Yes.	Sorry.

DAD
Wow.	Is there gonna be alcohol there?

SAMANTHA
Probably not.	Maybe some of the
seniors.
 
75.

DAD
Mm-hmm.	I know what this party is.
The parents are out of town, right?

Somebody's uh, scored a keg, right... You guys are gonna have a good time, trash the whole house... Right? Am I right?

SAMANTHA
No.

DAD	(O.S.)
No?	No?

SAMANTHA
No, Dad.	Amy's really responsible.

DAD
Mm-hmm.	Who's gonna be there?

SAMANTHA
Marie, Christine, Amy... Everyone.

DAD
Is uh, is that guy on your Facebook page, is he gonna be there? Hm?

SAMANTHA
Who?

DAD
Come on, the guy that has got his arm wrapped around you with his hair over his eyes and --

SAMANTHA
Garrett?

DAD
Garrett, is that his name? Alright, is Garrett gonna be there?

SAMANTHA
Probably?

DAD
Probably.
(to Mason)

Uh-huh, you see? I learn more about her from her Facebook page than I do from our scintillating conversation.
(to Samantha)
Is he your boyfriend?
 
76.

SAMANTHA
Kind of.

Dad turns to Mason for further information.

DAD
Have you met him? Has he been around the house?

MASON
Sometimes.

DAD
Sometime-zz?	Zzz?

Dad turns his attention back to Samantha.

DAD (CONT'D)
You have a boyfriend... Wow. Have you heard of Sarah Palin?

SAMANTHA
Yes.

DAD
What's the one thing that you know about Sarah Palin's seventeen year old daughter?

SAMANTHA
She's pregnant?

DAD
That's right. And what is the one thing that you are not going to be in a couple of years when you turn seventeen?

SAMANTHA
Pregnant?

DAD
That's right! Alright, now what are the, the two ways that you can achieve that goal? The first is... not have any sex. Okay? That's the first way. Okay? Just not engage in that. That did not work out very well for your mother and me. And what's the second way?

Mason stands to leave the table.

DAD (CONT'D)
Where are you going?
