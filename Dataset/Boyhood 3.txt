MASON
Bathroom.

DAD
You don't have to go to the bathroom. Sit down, Mason. Just... Just sit down. What's the second way? Alright? Has your mother talked to you guys about this stuff?

SAMANTHA
Oh, Dad.	Dad.

DAD
No, come on. Has she talked to you about... contraception?

The kids are visibly uncomfortable with the conversation. DAD  (CONT'D)

Huh? What has she -- condoms? Has she talked about that?

SAMANTHA (O.S.)
Oh, Dad.	Please!

DAD
What?	What?

SAMANTHA
That's enough.

DAD
Well.	Does Garret have a condom?

SAMANTHA
Ohh!	God!	Dad!

DAD
What? What, come on Sam. We have to be able to talk about this. Alright? Come on, we do. We can do it. We can do it. Just stay with me here. Alright? It's as hard for me as it is for you. But, seriously though, alright, I read an article in the paper the other day... that said that although U.S. teenagers are not the most sexually active, we have the highest rate of teenage pregnancy. Okay?

A woman, TAMMY, walks up to the table, interrupting their conversation.
 
78.

TAMMY
Hey.	What's goin' on?

DAD
Oh, hey.	Hey, Tammy.	How you doin'?

Dad stands to greet Tammy.

TAMMY
Nice to see you.

DAD
Wow, yeah, good to see you. Um, Tammy, this is my daughter Samantha.

TAMMY
Hey.

DAD
And this is Mason Junior right here.

Tammy.

TAMMY	(O.S.)
Mason Junior.

DAD	(O.S.)
Say hi.

MASON
Hi.

TAMMY
Hi, Mason. Nice to meet you. Heard a lot about you guys.

DAD
Yeah, yeah.	What're you doin' here?
You uh...

TAMMY
Oh, I'm just here with some friends.

DAD
Oh, well, uh....

TAMMY
Yeah.	What are you guys up to?

Dad sits back down at the table.

DAD
Um, we're going camping. Well no, this one is not going camping. This one is going to a party.
 
79.

TAMMY
(to Samantha)

Ohh... Fun.

DAD
We, the men, are going camping.

TAMMY
Boys are going camping. Alright, very nice. Well uh, we still on for tomorrow or...?

DAD	(O.S.)
Yeah --

TAMMY
Yeah?

DAD
Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I'll drop him off at seven and then I'll just call you, alright?

TAMMY
Okay.	Great.	It was really nice
meeting you both.	Take care.

DAD
I'll see you.

TAMMY
Talk to you soon.	Bye.

Tammy walks away. Mason smirks at his dad.

DAD
Don't -- don't, don't look at me like that, alright? I just -- look, just to finish the point -- okay? I was twenty-three when your mom had you, alright? So was she, alright? And we didn't put ourselves in the best position to be great parents, and I wish that -- I wish I were a better parent to you guys. Alright? And I, I hope that you can learn from my mistakes. Okay? So, wear a condom. Or get Garrett to -- I don't know. Whatever.

Samantha cringes, as Dad laughs. Mason can't help but smile.
 
80.

INT. MOVING CAR - DAY

Dad and Mason are driving along the open road, listening to a song by Wilco.

DAD
Now... listen to this song, alright?

Sings along:

DAD (CONT'D)
"I try to stay busy" It's just straight up, the lyrics... it's a straight up old school country song.

SONG
"I do the dishes, I mow the lawn..."

DAD
Listen to the production of this.
Production's like uh, like "Abbey

Road" or something.

SONG
"I try to keep myself occupied"

Dad sings along.

DAD
"Even though I know you're not comin' home." You know, his old woman's gone... straight up. Nothin' fancy.

DAD AND SONG
"I try to keep the house nice and
neat.	Make my bed.	I change the

sheets."

EXT. RIVERBED - DAY

Mason and Dad walk along the rocks, mid-conversation. They sit down near the water and begin taking off socks and shoes.

MASON
Yeah, I think she's about to get her master's degree.

DAD
Well, then she's gonna start applying for teaching jobs?

MASON
I think she already has.
 
81.

DAD
Really?	Where?

MASON
(shrugs)

All over.

DAD
All over Texas?

MASON
Yeah.

DAD
Well, if you gotta move, you gotta move, you know? It's no big deal. We can handle that. I'll still come get you every other weekend. I mean, unless she moves 500 miles away or something, it'll just be a little more car time. No big deal.

MASON
I'm just kinda sick of moving.

DAD
Well, I bet you are. But you know, you never know. I mean, I might have to move, right? I'm working for this insurance company now. These places get bought and sold all the time. You know? We'll just roll with it.

They take off pants, walk up to the water in boxer shorts.

MASON
I thought you were a musician?

DAD
I am but... life is expensive, you know. Guy's got to be responsible. What do you think?

Mason pushes his Dad into the water, then dives in himself. DAD (CONT'D)

Hey, hey, you bast -- Oh you, punk kid! You got no respect!

Dad splashes his son and they both begin to swim.

CUT TO:
 
82.

EXT. FOREST - DAY

Mason and Dad are now hiking through the woods.

MASON
You know that redhead at the bowling alley?

DAD
Sure.	What about her?

MASON
Do you know her well?

DAD
Ahhh, you know, we've hung out a

little bit.

MASON
Is she your girlfriend?

DAD
How do you mean?

MASON
Like... have you kissed her?

DAD
Um... Yeah.	Yeah.	I've kissed her.
What about you?	You got a girlfriend?

MASON
Sort of.

DAD
Really. Have you uh, have you kissed her?

MASON
Not really.

DAD
Yeah.	Well, what have you done?

MASON
Well, we talked on the phone.

DAD
Oh yeah?	How'd that go?

MASON
Pretty terrible.

DAD
Oh yeah?

(MORE)
 
83.

DAD (CONT'D)
(Laughs)

Why?

MASON
Well, when we're at school, we got plenty to talk about, but when we're alone or on the phone, it's like we have nothing in common.

DAD
Nothing?

MASON
Uh, she's not interested in music or video games or... the three best movies this summer...

DAD
All right.	What?

MASON
Tropic Thunder, Dark Knight and

Pineapple Express.

DAD
Yeah, what about 'em?

MASON
She said they all sucked.

DAD
Okay, well what's she interested in?

MASON
I don't know.	Goin' to the mall
with her stupid friends.

DAD
Alright. Well, is she cute? Watch your step there.

MASON
Yeah.

DAD
Yeah? Alright. Well, here's what you do. Alright. First off, you gotta ask her a lot of questions. Then you have to listen to the answers, alright, actually be interested in her. Alright, if you can do those things, you're gonna be light years ahead of all the other guys.
 
84.

EXT.	CAMPSITE - NIGHT

Dad and Mason sit around the campfire, making s'mores.

DAD
Okay, this is the best s'more I ever made in my life, alright.

MASON
Dad...

DAD
This is absolute peak.	Look at this.

MASON
Ah, that's just perfect.

DAD
Honey brown, no burn... look at that, huh?

Mason laughs.

DAD (CONT'D)
Sell that in the store.	Mmm.

MASON
That's like advertisement worthy.

DAD
Mm-hm.	Advertisement quality.

MASON
Yeah.

Dad laughs.

DAD
You think they ever will make another "Star Wars"?

MASON
I don't know. I mean, I think if they were to make another one that the period where the game is set is where it would have to be, 'cause there's nothin' after, really. At the end --

DAD
Yeah, no, "Return of the Jedi" it's over. There's nothin' --
 
85.

MASON
Yeah, there's nothing else to do

there.	But --

DAD
You know, you can turn Han Solo into a Sith lord. I mean --

MASON
Yeah, what are you gonna do?

They share a laugh.

EXT. CAMPSITE - LATER

Dad is singing and playing guitar -- "L.A. Freeway." -- from inside the tent.

EXT.	CAMPSITE - DAY

Dad is standing over the campfire, peeing on it. Mason steps out of the tent.

DAD
Good mornin'.

MASON
Mornin'.

DAD
You gotta pee?

MASON
Sure.

DAD
Ah. Hit the campfire. Ancient, uh, Native American custom. You're gonna give back to the Earth what you take from it and you don't burn the forest down.

Mason pees onto the fire.

EXT.	SCHOOL - DAY

Mom pulls up to drop the kids off at school.

MOM
Okay guys, you have a good day. Mason, don't forget, I have to teach late today. Sam's gonna pick you up. Right, Sam?
 
86.

SAMANTHA
Yeah.

MASON
Alright.

MOM
Okay.	Bye, guys.

MASON
See ya.

Mason exits the car and walks toward the school building.

INT. SCHOOL - DAY

Mason walks down the hall with his classmate TONY.

TONY
Hey.	That's who I was talking to
you about.

MASON
Yeah.	Good luck with that.

TONY
See you, man.

Mason stops to get new books out of his locker.

INT.	REST ROOM - DAY

Mason fixes his hair in the mirror. Two BULLIES are vandalizing the walls. Bully #1 turns and wanders over to Mason, suddenly bumping into him.

BULLY #1
Don't bump into me!	Little bitch!

MASON
I didn't!

BULLY #1
You callin' me a liar?

MASON
No.

BULLY #1
Don't act like you're tough shit,

motherfucker.

Bully #2 walks over to join the altercation.
 
87.

BULLY #2
I don't think pretty boy's hair's

good enough.

Bully #2 tries to mess with Mason's hair. Mason blocks his hand.

BULLY #2 (CONT'D)
Hey!	Don't touch me, faggot!

Another student enters.	The two bullies start to walk away.
Bully #1 shoves Mason and flips him off, as they exit.

BULLY #1
You're a fuckin' asshole.

EXT. SCHOOL - AFTERNOON

Mason leans against the wall of the school, waiting for Samantha to pick him up. When he realizes she isn't coming, he starts to walk away.

EXT. DOWNTOWN SAN MARCOS - MOMENTS LATER

Mason is now passing through an alley with JILL, who walks her bike alongside him.

JILL	(O.S.)
Hey, Mason!

MASON
Hi Jill.

JILL
So, where are you going?

MASON
Over to the college.

JILL
What's going on there?

MASON
My mom's a teacher.

JILL
Oh, cool!	What does she teach?

MASON
Psychology... I think. What are you up to?

JILL
Oh, my mom owns Needleworks.

(MORE)
 
88.

JILL (CONT'D)
The arts and crafts store over there?

So I'm just kind of hanging out. But I'm supposed to be going to the hospital soon.

MASON
How come?

JILL
You know Courtney? Girl with the dyed black hair and the nose ring? Wears Hot Topic every day?

MASON
I... think so.

JILL
We used to be best friends growing up, but we've kinda grown apart. She sorta got all emo. She thinks I'm a prep. But, I still consider her a friend! Anyway, she cut one of her wrists. I don't know how bad, but I think I should go visit.

Jill glances down at the book in Mason's hand.

JILL (CONT'D)
So what are you reading?

MASON
Oh, it's uh, "Breakfast of Champions".

Kurt Vonnegut.

JILL
I think my older brother likes him. I'm reading "To Kill a Mockingbird" for the third time. My friends make fun of me. I think I'm the only girl in the whole school who doesn't like the "Twilight" books. Have you read them?

MASON
Sure haven't.

JILL
I tried... but it was so cheesy! So how do you like San Marcos?

MASON
I like it alright. It's a lot smaller than Houston, but it seems pretty cool. Have you always lived here?
 
89.

JILL
Yeah. If you want the big city around here, you have to drive to San Antonio or Austin. Have you been there yet?

MASON
I went to San Antonio for a day, but... I haven't been to Austin yet.

JILL
That's where all the high school kids go, on weekends, for shows and stuff.

MASON
That's what I've heard.

JILL
So are you going to Shauna's party next weekend?

MASON
Um... I think I heard about it. I'm not really sure, though.

JILL
Well you should!

MASON
Why's that?

JILL
Well -- LeeAnn has a big crush on
you and I know she was hoping you
would go.	You don't have a

girlfriend, do you?

MASON
Not currently.

JILL
Well then, you should come. I'll tell Chase to make sure you're there.

MASON
Okay.

JILL
But don't tell LeeAnn I told you

that.	She'd kill me.

MASON
I won't.
 
90.

JILL
Well, I better get going. See you later.

MASON
Bye.

INT. COLLEGE CLASSROOM - DAY

Mason walks into his mother's classroom. He takes a seat to observe from the back, while she lectures.

MOM (O.S.)
His cognitive series, his interviews with orphans, Ethology theorists' work... And then he in turn was supported strongly by Harry Harlow's rhesus monkey study. Now you guys, you gotta think, this is the 1950's, this was radical! This flew in the face of traditional learning theory, of B.F. Skinner's classical and instrumental conditioning. Now, Bowlby is going to argue that human survival depends on us falling in love. It depends on me falling in love with my mother, and my mother falling in love with me. And if that doesn't happen, we're pretty much doomed. Now think about it. A tiger chases our tribe out of a cave. Now an ideal mother goes, "Huh! My baby! I love you! I'll protect you!" Or... "Well you, why am I going to pick you up? You're going to slow me down. You... are... tiger kibble!"

The class laughs.

MOM (CONT'D)
So next week we are gonna get into Bowlby's four stages of attachment -- oh oh, uh, Professor Douglas and I -- some of you might have classes with Elena -- she and I are hosting a little pre-Thanksgiving get-together at my place, so if anyone wants to come, please stop by.
(pause)

I'm not the greatest cook...

The class laughs again.
 
91.

INT. APARTMENT - DAY

Mason opens the door as he and his mother enter the house.

MOM
Thanks.

Mom drops her purse on the table and then walks down the hallway to Samantha's bedroom. She knocks on the door before walking inside.

MOM (CONT'D)
Samantha!

Samantha is sitting on her bed, listening to music with a friend, GABY.

SAMANTHA
Okay!	Mom...

MOM
Why in the hell didn't you pick up your brother like you said you would?

SAMANTHA
Mom, I know what you're gonna say. She was running late and we couldn't turn around.

MOM
No, no! No excuses! The bottom line is you didn't do what you said you were gonna do. You stranded your brother!

SAMANTHA
It's embarrassing to ask my friend to turn around and go get some kid at the middle school.

MOM
What do you mean "some kid"? He's your brother! And you know what? We've helped Janie out before. I mean, she lives right around the corner. It's no big deal.

SAMANTHA
Sorry.

MOM
You know what, Samantha? You need to start thinking long and hard about who you want to be.

(MORE)
 
92.

MOM (CONT'D)
Do you want to be a cooperative person, who is compassionate and helps people out? Or do you want to be a self-centered narcissist?

SAMANTHA
You know what? You're right. I am this horrible person... But honestly, he's not a baby anymore. You don't have to treat him like one. He's in eighth grade and he can find his way home if he wants to.

MOM
You know what?	When Gaby leaves,
you and me are gonna have a chat.

Mom leaves the room.

SAMANTHA
(to Gaby)

Awkward...

Gaby and Samantha laugh together.

GABY
Dude, that sucks.

EXT.	APARTMENT - DAY

CHASE approaches Mason's front door and knocks. Mason answers the door.

MASON
Hey man.	What's up?

CHASE
Hey, we're going camping tonight.

You in?

MASON
Uh, who's goin'?

CHASE
My brother, one of his friends, and

Tony... Maybe.

MASON
Yeah, let me check with my mom.

INT.	MOM'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Mom is sitting on her bed grading papers.
 
93.

MASON
Hey, Mom.	Can I go camping with
Chase tonight?

MOM
Camping?	Where?

MASON
Uh, at that house that his family's building. It's pretty much finished.

MOM
Well, will any adults be there?

MASON
(shrugs)

His brother's a senior.

MOM
You have your cell phone?

MASON
Yeah.

MOM	(O.S.)
Is it charged?

MASON
Mm-hmm.

MOM
Okay, do me a favor. Leave his parents' number and the address on the counter.

MASON
Okay.

INT.	CAMPING HOUSE - NIGHT

Mason, Chase, and Tony are now with two older guys, CHARLIE (Chase's older brother) and his friend (SENIOR GUY). The boys are drinking beer and breaking wooden boards with their feet.

SENIOR GUY
Yeah!	That's what I'm talkin' about!

The boys murmur indistinctly.

SENIOR GUY (CONT'D) You ready? Check this shit out. That was alright, but this is gonna be badass.
 
94.

CHARLIE
Alright, let me see, let me see what you can do.

SENIOR GUY
Alright. This -- is your face. I'm about to break his face, right here...

Senior Guy kicks through the wooden board.

BOYS
Ohh shit, alright.	Nice.

CHARLIE
Alright, alright.

CHASE
Alright, alright.	Now check this
out.	You might want to move.

Chase picks up a circular saw blade and throws it into a large piece of sheet-rock with the outline of a body on it.

CHASE (CONT'D)
Oww, that'd be painful. That's like the liver, stomach, something --

TONY
That's like the belly button --

MASON
Check this out, man.

Mason also heaves the blade into the human outline.

TONY
Whoa!	Pancreas!

MASON
That shit's lethal.

CHASE
Yeah, that would be painful.

CHARLIE
(To Mason)
Man, have a beer, man.	That was

awesome.	Here.

Mason takes the beer and opens it, winning the boys' approval.

SENIOR GUY
It's beer-30, children.
 
95.

CHASE
Nice.

Chase offers a beer to Tony.

TONY
Aw, no thanks.

CHASE
Come on, man.

CHARLIE
What, are you a pussy?

TONY
No, I just don't feel like drinking a beer right now.

CHARLIE
Man, if you're too chicken shit to even have a beer, I know for a fact that you have never gotten any pussy.

TONY
Like you guys have.

CHASE
Sure have.

TONY
When?

CHASE
Last summer.

MASON
With who?

CHARLIE
It was awesome. Chase went down easy street and fucked this whore Nancy. At least that's what he said.

CHASE
I did.	Would I lie?

SENIOR GUY
Bullshit.	Quick, where were you?

CHASE
At Tobler's house. And, she fucked a couple other guys, too.
 
96.

CHARLIE
Oh man, his first piece of ass was sloppy seconds.

The boys all laugh.

CHARLIE	(CONT'D)
What about you, Mason? You ever got any?

SENIOR GUY
Yeah, you ever made her, uh, howl

into the night?

MASON
A few times.

TONY
(skeptical)

Really?

SENIOR GUY
Yeah, right.	What was her name,
Lucky?

MASON
Nooo. Jennifer. She doesn't live here, though. She's back in Houston.

CHARLIE
You're fucking lying.

MASON
I don't care if you assholes believe me or not.

SENIOR GUY
Let me guess -- you were pulling all kinds of ass back home, but once you got down here... lefty.

Senior Guy motions with his left hand.

MASON
Hey, fuck you. I would, but none of the girls here want to.

CHARLIE
Dude, it's not what they want, man.

It's what you want.

SENIOR GUY
True dat.

Senior Guy toasts, as Mason rolls his eyes.
 
97.

CHARLIE
You know what you should do? Join a band. That's all it takes, man.

MASON
Oh yeah?

CHARLIE
Fuck yeah, dude. You don't even have to play that well. I mean, you start playing your instrument, and they line up to give you blow jobs.
(Points to Tony)
Except for you. It doesn't impress the ladies so much when you play flute for the marching band.

TONY
I'm not in the fucking marching band.

SENIOR GUY
Ah dude, you sure? I heard you play the skin flute.

TONY
Alright, I got a question for you guys. If you think you're so cool, why are you hanging out with a bunch of eighth graders on a Friday night?

SENIOR GUY
Hey, fuck you, you little penis wrinkle. You know, you're lucky to even be here. This is our camp out. The only reason you little cum gums are here is because fucking Charlie's mom made him bring his little asshole brother, and then he drags along you little dice danglers. Fucking fuzz nut, talking shit!

Senior Guy throws a beer just past Tony.

CHARLIE
It's all good, man.	These little
fuzz nuts are going to get their
chance soon enough.	We got some
whores coming by later.

CHASE
Yeah?

SENIOR GUY
Hell yeah!
 
98.

CHARLIE
Now, I know Chase will fuck anything. I mean, I've seen this kid mount boulders before. But what about you guys? You in?

MASON
Whatever.

CHARLIE
Alright.

SENIOR GUY
Alright, good man.	What about you,
Peter Puffer?

TONY
I don't know.	Maybe.

SENIOR GUY
Dude, it's okay to be gay. We understand. Just, you know, sleep over there.

TONY
I'm not gay.

CHARLIE
Give it some time, man.	You'll
realize.

TONY
Fuck y'all.

CHARLIE
See, that's exactly my point, man. Nah, but we don't have whores coming over, we were just fucking with you to see what you'd say.

SENIOR GUY
Yeah, and you just earned your Vag

Badge.

CHARLIE
Put it next to your bitch card.

SENIOR GUY
Yeah, 'cause you know, you're a bitch. Now hold this, like the bitch you are, bitch.

The boys return to breaking boards.
 
99.

SENIOR GUY (CONT'D)
Alright, this shit is called the

Death Punch.

Senior Guy breaks the board in half with one direct punch.

BOYS
Ohh!	Jesus!

INT.	MOM'S HOUSE - DAY

Mom is hosting a pre-Thanksgiving get-together with 10-15 people all drinking wine and talking

MOM
(to Mason and Samantha)

Hey, you guys made it!	Good.

Mom places a cheese plate on the living room table.

MOM (CONT'D)
Oh, there you are.

PROFESSOR DOUGLAS hands Olivia a glass of wine.

PROFESSOR DOUGLAS
And here you go, hostess.

MOM
Oh, thank you. Hey, can I get you a bite?

INT.	MASON'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Mason sits on his bed, chatting with a COLLEGE GIRL, who looks around his room. There is a large graffiti mural on the wall behind him.

COLLEGE GIRL
(points to the mural)

Oh, that's cool.

MASON
Thanks.

COLLEGE GIRL
You did that?

MASON
Yeah.

COLLEGE GIRL
Wow. How long have you been doing that for?
 
100.

MASON
Not very long. Um, I went to this camp thing just this past summer.

COLLEGE GIRL
They have a camp for graffiti?

MASON
Well, they call it "urban art".

COLLEGE GIRL
Oh.

MASON
So it sounds, you know, less illegal, but... it was really just a way to get free spray paint.

COLLEGE GIRL
Cool. So is this your tag? Is that -- do they still call it...?

MASON
Yeah, but you know, it's just letters that I'm good at writing.

COLLEGE GIRL
Oh.	K...

MASON
E.

COLLEGE GIRL
E.	Z.	J.	O.	Kezjo.	That's cool.

MASON
It doesn't really mean anything,

though.

The College Girl notices a picture of Mason and his Dad leaning against the GTO.

COLLEGE GIRL
Is that your dad?

MASON
Yeah.

COLLEGE GIRL
Where's he live?

MASON
In Houston.
 
101.

COLLEGE GIRL
Get to see him much?

MASON
Yeah, yeah. Some weekends, and over the summer.

COLLEGE GIRL
Cool.

MASON
So you're a student of my mom's,

right?

COLLEGE GIRL
Mm-hm.	Yeah, she's uh, I got one
class with her.	Yeah, she's cool.

MASON
How's she doing? You know, is she -- is she a good teacher and everything?

COLLEGE GIRL
Yeah! She's great. She's super smart and she cares, you know, she makes it interesting. She's probably even my favorite teacher.

Mason nods.

INT. DINING AREA - MOMENTS LATER

One of Mom's students, JIM, tells a story while the group sits around the table eating.

JIM
...So anyway, we figured out a way to rig up our iPods to the external speakers on the ASV. So every time we come rolling into town, you knew the 456 was there, 'cause we were bumping House of Pain. It was like, "Jump around, Jump around." And the whole family's coming outside, and you got the kids and the mom and the dad, and they're all bouncing up and down. We're throwing out candies for the kids, and soccer balls, and Beanie Babies, and Frisbees... Um, like, smokes for the adults. And they loved, they absolutely loved, Gatorade. But for some reason, you know, they hated the lemon-lime flavor. I don't know what it was. Yeah. Couldn't give it away.
 
102.

The group laughs.

MOM
How long were you over there?

JIM
Uhh... I did two tours in Iraq and one in Bosnia.

MOM
Wow.

MASON
Did you enlist?

JIM
Mm-hmm.	Yeah.	I was, um, Army
National Guard.	And, uh, you know
coming straight out of high school.
Needed money for college.	Seemed
like a decent paying job.	And, uh,
did my tour.	And whenever I got
done, I told them if there's, you
know, a world-changing event, I'll
come back.	And, uh, 3 months later
9/11 happened.	And I was back 9/12.
And I'm proud to say the 456, the
whole time we were there, we never
lost a guy.	Not one casualty.

MOM
But is that odd?	Is that unusual?

JIM
Yeah. Almost impossible. Like the guys that came along after us and replaced us, they didn't listen to any of our advice. They, you know, did basically the polar opposite of what we did, and they lost seven guys in the first month.

MOM
Wow.	What did you guys do
differently?

JIM
Well, I'd like to think it's just a matter of mutual respect, you know. I mean, all the time we spent over there building trust, I mean these guys basically destroyed it in three days.
 
103.

PROFESSOR DOUGLAS
So, what did the locals think about why we were there?

JIM
Oil.	Plain and simple.

INT.	LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

The College Girl is now playing guitar and singing "Wish You Were Here" along with others in the living room. At some point, Mason notices Mom talking with Jim outside on the porch.

EXT. CAR - NIGHT

A station wagon pulls up in front of Mason's house. The teenagers inside are listening to music, about to drop Mason off at home.

INT.	CAR - NIGHT

Mason is in the far back of the station wagon, making out with a BLONDE GIRL.

CHASE
Hey, Mason.
(hands Mason a joint)

One last hit.

Mason takes a hit of the joint.

CHARLIE
(in the driver's seat)

Hey! Mickey Mouse Club. Get the fuck out of my car. Just crawl out the back window or something, man.

Mason climbs out the back window of the station wagon.

BLONDE GIRL
I'm gonna miss you.

MASON
I'll see you on Sunday night.

BLONDE GIRL
Alright.	You better text me.

MASON
Mm.	Do you have any gum?

BLONDE GIRL
Um... yeah, I do, actually.	Here
you go.
 
104.

MASON
Thanks.	See ya.

Mason kisses her good-night.

INT.	JIM'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Mom is hosting a small get-together, and is currently talking with Professor Douglas.

MOM
...And they're buying this party line that they're supposed to feel bad and trade off their own pension, as if that's what's corrupting this nation.

PROFESSOR DOUGLAS
Yeah, because those who hear Fox, in

my opinion, are being lied to.

MOM
Yeah, thank God for Wisconsin. I mean, we have to follow that example.

PROFESSOR DOUGLAS
You're right.

Mason enters the front door.

JIM
Hey, Mason.	What time is it?

MASON
Uh, like 12:15.

JIM
Happy birthday.

Mason smiles.

MOM
Huh!	Happy birthday!

Mom kisses Mason. Professor Douglas walks over to join them, taking an interest.

PROFESSOR DOUGLAS
Mason, it's your birthday?

MASON
Uh, just now, I guess.

PROFESSOR DOUGLAS
Yeah, how old are you?
 
105.

MASON
Fifteen.

PROFESSOR DOUGLAS
Fifteen!	Give me a hug.

Professor Douglas hugs Mason.

PROFESSOR DOUGLAS (CONT'D)
Happy birthday.	Oh my goodness!

Professor Douglas rejoins the party.

MOM
(to Mason)

Have you been drinking?

MASON
Have you?

MOM
Yeah, a little.	Have you?

MASON
A little bit.

MOM
Have you been...?

Mom mimes smoking reefer.

MASON
A little bit.

MOM
Oh... okay.

MASON
I'm gonna go to sleep.

MOM
Talk in the morning, huh?

EXT. JIM'S FRONT YARD - DAY

Dad and Jim stand around in front of the house. ANNIE opens the doors to the new mini-van, so the kids can load their overnight bags.

SAMANTHA
Hey, Dad!

DAD
Hey!	How you doing?
 
106.

Dad kisses Samantha on the cheek.

SAMANTHA
Good!	Whose car is that?

DAD
That's our car.	Hop on in there.

SAMANTHA
(to Annie)

Hey!

ANNIE
Hey, sweetie.

Annie give Samantha a hug. Samantha peeks in the side door of the mini-van, finding baby COOPER in a car seat.

SAMANTHA
Hey Cooper!	Hey, how's it goin'?
Hello little brother!
(to Annie)

He's so cute.

EXT. JIM'S SIDE YARD - CONTINUOUS

Mom talks with two workers about an exposed pipe in the yard.

MOM
Can we just replace that part of the pipe?

WORKER
No, no it's no good. Everything is no good.

MOM
(attempting Spanish)

Todo...	Total?

WORKER
Everything, yes... Mira.

He shows the broken pipe with his shovel. He asks the other worker to demonstrate the strength of the replacement pipe by standing on it.

WORKER (CONT'D)
See this one is...

MOM
Gusto... it's stronger?

WORKER
Yes.	It's better.	Yes, yes, yes.
 
107.

EXT. JIM'S FRONT YARD - CONTINUOUS

DAD
(to Jim)

Hey listen, uh, thanks for that camera you got Mason.

JIM
Oh,	yeah... Mason's --

DAD
He's loving that thing.

JIM
He's all into the photography thing right now.

DAD
Yeah, I know.

JIM
He's actually talking about turning his, uh, his closet into a dark room. The red light and developing, the whole nine...

DAD
Yeah?	You alright with that?

JIM
I probably won't see him for a week...

DAD
Yeah... Right... Well...

JIM
But, you know. He's having a good time.

DAD
At least he's focusing on something.

JIM
Yeah, yeah.

DAD
You know?	That's what I like.

JIM
Yeah, he's all about it.
 
108.

EXT.	JIM'S SIDE YARD - CONTINUOUS

MOM
(pointing to the pipe)

Okay... Let's go grande.

WORKER
It's good?

MOM
It's good.

WORKER
It's good.	It's better.	Yes.

He instructs the other worker on how to get started. Mom turns to join the others in front yard.

MOM
Hey, you know, you're smart.	You
should be in school.

WORKER
I like school, I need school, but

it's hard.	I work all day...

MOM
Go to night school.	At community
college.	It's -- It's pretty
affordable.

EXT. JIM'S FRONT YARD - CONTINUOUS

DAD
You're doing a nice job with the house though, it's looking great... really great.

JIM
Thanks. Yeah, you know, some fix-its here and there, you know. We got a good deal on the foreclosure... So, now I'm finding out why. You

know?

DAD
(laughs)

Yeah.	Right?

Mason walks outside, carrying a duffel bag.

DAD (CONT'D)
Hey bud!	Hey, Happy Birthday!

The mini-van catches Mason's attention.
 
109.

MASON
What's that?

DAD
What's that?	That's our new car!
Get in it.

Dad gives Mason a hug.	Jim shakes Mason's hand.

JIM
Alright, have a good weekend.

Mom arrives at the front yard and greets Dad with a hug.

MOM
Hi.

DAD
Hey, how you doing?	Good to see
you.

MOM
You too.
(to Annie)

Hey!

ANNIE
Hey, how are you?

Mom gives Annie a hug.

MOM
You look great.

ANNIE
Oh, thanks.

MOM
Aww, look at him!	Ooh.	He's got
Mason's nose.

SAMANTHA
Yeah, isn't he cute?

MOM
Yeah.

Dad gets into the van, as the family closes all the doors.

DAD
Alright!

MASON
Love you guys.
 
110.

DAD
We got a big drive ahead of us.

MOM
Bye, Sam.

JIM
You guys drive safe.

DAD
Alright. Well, we'll be back tomorrow night.

MOM
Bye, honey.	I'm so glad you were
born!

Dad, Annie, and the kids drive off for Houston. Mom and Jim are left standing in the front yard, as they watch the van drive away.

INT.	MINI-VAN - DAY

MASON
So, this is like Annie's car and... and you drive the GTO? I guess you can't really put a baby seat in that thing.

DAD
Yeah, no... But I had to sell that anyway.

MASON
You what?

DAD
Yeah, I had to sell that.

MASON
So... so it's gone?

DAD
Yeah, some sucker collector from California paid twenty-two grand for it, which is great 'cause I basically got to pay for this in cash. I only paid eighty-five hundred for that thing way back when. I mean, you know, cars are generally a terrible investment. You know? Soon as you drive them off the lot you got a used car on your hands, and the value's only dropping from there.

(MORE)
 
111.

DAD (CONT'D)
But... if you take care of it, you know, and you get lucky and it's a classic, you know, the value starts going up again. I mean shit, you got guys paying hundreds of thousands of dollars for some Shelby Cobra.

After a long silence, Dad notices Mason is unusually quiet. DAD (CONT'D)

What?

MASON
You don't remember?

DAD
Remember what?

MASON
Really? You said that was going to be my car when I turned sixteen.

DAD
(laughs)

What? No, I didn't. I never said that.

MASON
I remember.	I was in third grade
and you were taking me over to Anthony Nagar's house for his birthday...
and we were there early, so we gave him a ride around the block. And he was talking about how much he loved your car and so you were all like "Oh. This is going to be Mason's when he turns 16."

DAD
What are you..? Alright, first off, I have no memory of that, alright? Second of all, I would never say that. Never.

MASON
Yeah.	You did though.

DAD
What? Mason. Come on, what about your sister? I'm just gonna forget about her? Come on, how's that fair? Huh? Anthony Nagar, what the?

(MORE)
 
112.

DAD (CONT'D)
(laughs)

Are you...? Oh, come on! I mean, you're not... Ughh.

Look, you can sit there like there's a death in the family, alright, but bottom line is that was my car.
Alright? I paid for it, I took care of it, and I can do whatever I want with it. Alright? I'm sorry if you had other ideas about it but when you get older you can save up and buy a car of your own. And be cool like I used to be. Or... you can get a mini-van.

Annie and Samantha watch a Lady Gaga music video on Samantha's cell phone in the back seat.

ANNIE
Does your mom actually let you watch this?

SAMANTHA
Yeah.	She likes it too.

ANNIE
(laughing)

Oh, my god...	Okay, well.

SAMANTHA
Yeah.

ANNIE
Have you ever seen her in concert?

SAMANTHA
No.	But she's coming to Houston in
April.

ANNIE
She's coming to Houston?

SAMANTHA
Mm-hmm.

ANNIE
Oh you know, your dad and I could get you tickets, and you could stay with us.

SAMANTHA
That'd be great.
 
113.

ANNIE
Yeah.

DAD
Hey, hey, Annie? Will you get me the, the little birthday present for Mason?

ANNIE
Yeah, babe.

Annie hands a small wrapped present to Dad. Mason unwraps the gift to reveal a CD set.

DAD
Alright. This one, this one needs a little explanation, okay? Open it up. I call that "The Beatles' Black Album". Alright, what it is, is the best of John, Paul, George, and Ringo solo, post-break up.

MASON
Thanks.

DAD
Yeah, basically, I put the band back together for you.

Annie Laughs.

DAD (CONT'D)
You know, whenever you listen to too much of the solo stuff, it kind of becomes a drag, you know? But you put 'em next to each other, alright, and they start to elevate each other... and then you can hear it. Huh! It's The Beatles. You know?

MASON
I don't know. I think I always just liked Paul the best.

DAD
It doesn't matter, you know, you're missing the point. There is no favorite Beatle! That's what I'm saying. It's in the balance. That's what made them the greatest fucking rock band in the world. Okay? You know, and there's this decade of music out there that's been scattered. Alright?

(MORE)
 
114.

DAD (CONT'D)
And now it has been carefully found, arranged, and ordered for you, by your loving father.

ANNIE
Very arranged and very organized, over and over again by your loving father.

DAD
Yes, yes, yes. So, I mean, look at that-- look at that, uh, top of Volume II, first four tracks... You've got "Band on the Run" into "My Sweet Lord", into "Jealous Guy", into "Photograph". I mean, come on.

It's like the perfect segue. You got Paul, who takes you to the party, George who talks to you about God, John who says no, it's about love and pain, and then Ringo who just says hey, can't we enjoy what we have while we have it? It's a good record. I shit you not.

MASON
Cool.

EXT. RANCH HOUSE - DAY

The mini-van drives along a dirt road lined with trees and parks outside of a small ranch home. GRANDPA CLIFF and NANA come outside to greet their guests.

DAD
Hey there, Cliff.

GRANDPA CLIFF
Hey, how you doin'?

DAD
Oh, good.	How you doin'?

NANA
(to Mason)

Oh, hi, birthday boy! It's good to see you.

GRANDPA CLIFF
Good.	Good to see you.

DAD
Ah, it's great to see you.
 
115.

GRANDPA CLIFF
You made it alright, huh?

DAD
Yeah, we sure did.	We sure did.

GRANDPA CLIFF
(to Annie)

How are you, darling?

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Annie and Nana quietly light the candles on Mason's birthday cake.

DAD
Alright, we ready?

ANNIE
Yeah, yeah, get started --

NANA
Wait, wait, wait...

INT.	LIVING ROOM - DAY

DAD
Hey, Sam.

He subtly indicates for her to get off her laptop and join the family. They take their seats in the living room.

DAD (CONT'D)
Hey, still sleeping here?

GRANDPA CLIFF
Oh, yeah, sawin' logs.

DAD
You ready?

The family sings happy birthday to Mason. Nana brings in the birthday cake, complete with lit candles.

ALL
(singing)

Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday, dear Mason... Happy birthday to you!

DAD
Make a wish, make a wish.

Mason blows out the candles. The family cheers.
 
116.

NANA
Real good! Presents! Wait, wait, wait. Here, sweetie.

Nana hands Mason a wrapped gift.

DAD
Hey Sam, would you get us a knife so we can cut this up? Hey? Alright.

Sam walks into the kitchen to grab a knife.

NANA
I hope you like it.	I heard you
didn't have one, so.

He unwraps the gift.

NANA (CONT'D)
It's a Bible.	Is this your first
Bible?	Look, there's your name...

MASON
Wow.

NANA
...In gold. And wait-wait-wait-wait. Look at this. It's a Red Letter edition, and that means that everything Jesus said is in red.

MASON
Thank you.

NANA
Like it?	Alright.	I love you,
sweetie.	Happy Birthday.

ANNIE
And this one's from us.

Annie hands Mason a large gift box.

DAD
It's not going to make all your dreams come true, here, you know. Just keep your expectations low. No, no, no, no, you need it. It's...

Dad pulls a blue dress shirt, blazer, and tie out of the box.

DAD (CONT'D)
It's -- hey! Come, on right? You gotta have it. You need this.
 
117.

NANA
Wow!

DAD
You've got life ahead of you. You know --

ANNIE
And the shirt is blue, and I know

you like blue.

DAD
You've got dances --

NANA
It's beautiful!

DAD
--	And job interviews. Here, I'm going to get it all wrinkled here.

Grandpa comes out of the kitchen with a covered gun.

GRANDPA CLIFF
Mason?

DAD
(whispers)

The Black Album was from me.

NANA
Uh-oh.

GRANDPA CLIFF
Come here, son.	Pull	that off.

Mason walks over and pulls the case off to reveal a shotgun.

GRANDPA CLIFF (CONT'D)
There's a 20 gauge shotgun.

MASON
Wow.

GRANDPA CLIFF
Yeah. My dad gave it to me when I was a little younger than you, and his dad gave it to him, and well, you're fifteen and I'd like for you to have it. Alright? Here, you hold it. Yeah.

MASON
(taking the gun)

Thank you.
 
118.

GRANDPA CLIFF
Congratulations, son.	I'll teach
you how to clean it, teach you how
to fire it.	I'll teach you a little
bit of safety.

The family laughs, as Mason holds the gun pointing precariously across the room.

EXT. RANCH HOUSE - DAY

Samantha holds a pistol, ready to shoot. Dad is helping her aim. There are bottles and cans lined up as targets.

DAD
Now cock it. Alright, there you go. Now, what you want to do is line up the front sight with the back sight, here, you see this little V right here --

SAMANTHA
Mm-hm.

DAD
Now which one you aiming at?

SAMANTHA
Ah, the middle can.

DAD
The middle can?	Alright, alright.
Now fire at will, alright?

SAMANTHA
Okay.

Samantha shoots the can.

DAD
Ho.	Whoa!

Dad claps as Samantha lowers the pistol.

SAMANTHA
Yeah!

GRANDPA CLIFF
Howdy!

DAD
Alright, watch out, watch out.	Whoa.

Be careful.	Alright.
 
119.

Mason holds the shotgun, taking aim.
Grandpa Cliff throws a chunk of wood up into the air as a target.

GRANDPA CLIFF
Ready?	Pull!

Mason misses the fist shot.

GRANDPA CLIFF (CONT'D) You uh, you uh, hit a little low. Wait until it gets up high and then shoot. Alright? Cause then it's a better aim coming down. Remember, second trigger.

MASON
Mm-hm.

GRANDPA CLIFF
Ready?

MASON
Mm-hm.

GRANDPA CLIFF
Pull!

Grandpa Cliff throws another piece of wood into the air.
This time, Mason hits it.

GRANDPA CLIFF (CONT'D) Hah! Hah! Look what you did! Well, you nailed it, didn't you? How's that feel?

MASON
Felt good.

GRANDPA CLIFF
Yeah, it felt good.	Good.

EXT. RANCH HOUSE - NIGHT

The family sits out on the porch in a circle. Dad plays guitar as the family sings along.

DAD
(singing)

Well, I want for us to be together forever.

ANNIE
(singing)

But to wander wherever I may.
 
120.

DAD
(singing)

I want you to be easy and casual.

ANNIE
(singing)

But still demand I stay.

SAMANTHA
(singing)

I want for you to know me completely, but still remain mysterious.

MASON
(singing)

Consider everything deeply, but still remain fearless.

DAD AND ANNIE
(singing)

Climb to the top, look over the ledge. Dance barefoot on a razor's edge. Reach for the stars, grab the tiger by the tail.

MASON
(singing)

If I don't try, I'll never fail.

DAD
Good!

DAD AND ANNIE
(singing)

If you go home, you're rolling the dice. Can't step in the same river twice. If you love too much it'll turn to hate. If you never leave home you'll never be late. If you eat too much, you're gonna get fat. If you buy a dog, you'll piss off your cat.
