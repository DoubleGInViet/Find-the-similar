Grandpa Cliff and Nana both laugh.

DAD AND ANNIE (CONT'D) Take a deep breath, and enjoy the ride. Cause arrivals and departures run side by side...

Annie's parents cheer as the song concludes.
 
121.

DAD (O.S.)
Alright, you're our first audience, you know? Mason demanded we work on it the whole drive.

GRANDPA CLIFF
It was really wonderful.	That's
sweet.	Sweet.

NANA
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

GRANDPA CLIFF
Impressive.

DAD
It's a work in progress.

EXT. CHURCH - DAY

A small country church.

PREACHER (O.S.)
A week later -- we don't know why Thomas wasn't there the first time -- but a week later, Thomas comes back and joins the other disciples. They say, "Hey, the Lord's alive, we saw him!"

INT. CHURCH - DAY

The preacher stands at the front of the church holding an open bible. The family sits among the congregation. Mason is wearing his new suit.

PREACHER
"I won't believe it until I put my finger into his side and I'm gonna see those nail prints in his hands." Poof! About that time, here comes Jesus, standing right next to him. Okay? And he turns to Thomas. Don't you know Thomas felt some shame?

And he turns to Thomas and says, "Thomas, here, stick your finger in my side. Look at these nail prints. It's me." And Thomas says, "My Lord, and my God, I believe."

Annie's parents nod in agreement.

PREACHER (CONT'D)
And Jesus said, "Well, that's good.

(MORE)
 
122.

PREACHER (CONT'D)
But blessed are those who can believe without seeing." It's a lot easier when you can see, and feel, and touch. But like us, we haven't seen him in the flesh. We haven't felt him in the flesh. But we have experienced him in the spirit. At least I have, and I hope y'all have too.

EXT. WOODS - DAY

The family walks through the woods. Annie holds Cooper to her chest in a cloth carrier. Mason has his camera in hand. Dad chews on a piece of straw.

ANNIE
The pond's right up here. Ooh, it's low.

DAD
Yeah.

ANNIE
You know, my dad could take you fishing next time you're here if you want.

MASON
Nice.

ANNIE
(to Cooper)

Hi, baby.	What's goin' on?

Mason and Samantha walk down to the pond. Annie sits on a picnic bench with Cooper.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
You know, I think we're just gonna hang out here for a minute.

DAD
Want me to stay with you?

ANNIE
No, it's okay.

DAD
You sure?

ANNIE
Yeah, thanks.
 
123.

Samantha pushes a stick into the mud. Mason photographs pond.

SAMANTHA
Mason, why are you such a stick-in-the-mud?

MASON
What are you even talking about?

DAD
Hey, you guys don't mind coming back here on the 20th, do you, for Cooper's baptism?

MASON
No, it's fine.

DAD
Sam?

SAMANTHA
Okay.

DAD
I appreciate it.	It means a lot to
Annie and her folks, you know.

MASON
Were we baptized?

They share a look and laugh.

DAD
I wasn't the least bit concerned with the state of your soul. We can do it now, though, if you want.

MASON
No, nah, I think I'm alright.

DAD
You and Cooper together, you know.

Dunk your heads.

SAMANTHA
You're not becoming one of those God people, are you, Dad?

DAD
And what's that supposed to mean,

hm?

ANNIE
I can hear you!
 
124.

DAD
Well, I think that shotgun should live at my house, huh. I don't think your mom would love that.

Dad picks up a rock.

DAD (CONT'D)
Hey, look out, Sam. Let me show you how it's done.

Dad skips the rock across the pond.	Mason photographs it.

SAMANTHA
Nice, Dad.

She laughs.

DAD
Still got the goods, hmm?

INT. DARKROOM - DAY

Mason is developing a picture in the darkroom. His teacher, MR. TURLINGTON, wanders in.

TURLINGTON
How long you been in here, Mason?

MASON
I'm not sure.

TURLINGTON
I'm sure.	All class.	Did you
complete your image diary?

MASON
Not yet.

TURLINGTON
Completed your, uh, digital contact sheet?

MASON
Not quite, but... I mean, it's not gonna take me long.

TURLINGTON
Not yet. Not quite. Darkroom time is extra-curricular. I mean technically, you don't ever have to be in here these days, and certainly not until you've completed your assignments. That's the deal.
 
125.

MASON
Sorry.

TURLINGTON
I'm worried about you, Mason.

MASON
Why is that?

TURLINGTON
I'll tell you why. The images you're turning in, they're cool. You're looking at things in a really unique way. Got a lot of natural talent.

MASON
Thanks.

TURLINGTON
Yeah, but, that and fifty cents will just get you a cup of coffee in this old world. I've met a lot of talented people over the years. How many of them made it professionally without discipline, commitment, and a really good work ethic?

Mason shrugs and shakes his head, unsure. TURLINGTON (CONT'D)

I can tell you. I can count it on two fingers. Zero. It's not gonna happen for you, Mason. The world is too competitive. There are too many talented people who are willing to work hard. And a butt-load of morons who are untalented, who are more than willing to surpass you. As a matter of fact, a lot of them are sitting in that classroom out there right now. Hm? You know what they're doing? They're doing their assignments, which is what you're supposed to be doing, but you're not. You're in here. Why is that? Are you special, Mason?

MASON
No, but I mean the things you're talking about, like work ethic or whatever, I feel like I do work pretty hard. I spend the whole weekend taking pictures a lot of times.
 
126.

TURLINGTON
You like football, Mason?

MASON
Not really.

TURLINGTON
Yeah, I know you don't. That's why I've just assigned you to shoot the football game tonight. Okay? It starts at 7:30. I want you to get there early. I want you to shoot a full card, three hundred images, and I want 'em downloaded, I want 'em sorted, and I want to see them very first thing Monday. Okay? You want to know why I'm doing this?

MASON
I guess.

TURLINGTON
Who do you want to be, Mason? What do you want to do?

MASON
I want to take pictures.	Make art.

TURLINGTON
Any dip-shit can take pictures, Mason. Art, that's special. What can you bring to it that nobody else can?

MASON
That's what I'm trying to find out.

TURLINGTON
Try harder. Hey, maybe in twenty years you can call old Mr. Turlington and you can say, "Thank you, sir, for that terrific dark room chat we had that day."
(walking away)
Get back to class and do your work.

INT. CLASSROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Mason walks back to his computer. NICK sits at the neighboring computer.

NICK
Hey man.	You're walkin' a little
funny.
 
127.

MASON
Fuck you.

NICK
I'm just saying, you guys were in there for a long time. Just hope he bought you dinner first.

Mason playfully jabs Nick in the arm.

INT. JIM'S HOUSE - DAY

Jim sits at the kitchen table, opening a beer. Mom and Samantha prepare dinner in the kitchen. Mom walks over to the stairs to call up to Mason.

MOM
Mason!	Honey, come down for dinner.

On her way back to the kitchen, Mom notices the screen on an open laptop.

MOM (CONT'D)
Samantha! You didn't post these pictures and their descriptions? Come on, this auction is going to end on Sunday, honey. You've got to get those posted.

SAMANTHA
Why are we even doing this? It's like an online junk shop. I thought you had a good job?

MOM
I do. We're what you call house poor. Everyone's got to do their part. Your brother took the pictures. You have to help.

SAMANTHA
Who even buys this shit?

JIM
Hey, Sam, watch your mouth, alright? Don't disrespect your mother. You like a roof over your head, don't you?

MOM
Yeah, and you like having electricity so that you can charge your cell phone?
 
128.

SAMANTHA
I'm not even gonna be here next year. I'm a senior. I should be having fun.

Mason enters. He sits down at the table. He has blue nail polish on his fingernails.

JIM
Nice nails.

MASON
Yeah, some girl did that in sixth

period.

JIM
You planning on keeping them?

MASON
Until it comes off, I guess.

JIM
Last summer it was the earrings, and now the nails. You got a, uh, you got a purse to go with all that?

SAMANTHA
A lot of guys do that.	He's just
trying to be cool.

JIM
When I was in high school, having a job, being responsible, being able to afford a car, that was cool.

MOM
Mason, honey, why don't you get you and your sister some water.

Mason gets up to help set the table.

EXT. FOOTBALL GAME - NIGHT

An announcer comments on the game over the loud speaker. The crowd cheers and the band plays. Mason is on the sidelines, photographing details he finds interesting. He scrolls through the images on his camera.

NICK
Hey man, Turlington says to cut the artsy crap and shoot the game. So take your lens and point it that way.
 
129.

MASON
Jesus Christ.

NICK
Also, we got a ride tonight.

CHASE
McCormick gonna take us to the party.
We're gonna head out after the game.

You're goin', okay?

MASON
Okay.

NICK
Shoot the game.

A player catches the ball and is tackled.

EXT. PARTY - NIGHT

"She's Long Gone" by the Black Keys plays over the party. Mason fills a cup at the keg. Samantha takes a shot with a boy. Kids play beer bong.

BEER PONG GUY
Kobe...

It goes in - guests react.

GABY
Oh!	First one.	What was that?
What was that?	What is up?

Nick plays drums with teen band.	Mason approaches SHEENA.
He nudges her shoulder.

SHEENA
Hey, what's up?

MASON
Hey.	How's it goin'?

SHEENA
Pretty good. How long have you been here?

MASON
I don't know.	Awhile, I guess.

SHEENA
Awhile?	Yeah.
 
130.

EXT. QUIET SPOT - MOMENTS LATER

Mason and Sheena sit and talk.

MASON
I just feel like there are so many things that I could be doing and probably want to be doing that I'm just not.

SHEENA
Why aren't you?

MASON
I mean, I guess it's... just being afraid of what people would think. You know, judgment.

SHEENA
Yeah. I guess it's really easy to say, like, I don't care what anyone else thinks, but, everyone does, you know? Deep down.

MASON
Exactly. I find myself so furious at all these people that I'm in contact with just for controlling me or whatever, but you know, they're not even aware they're doing it.

SHEENA
Yeah. So... in this perfect world where no one's controlling you, what's different? What changes?

MASON
Everything. I mean, I just wanna be able to do anything I want, because it makes me feel alive. As opposed to giving me the appearance of normality.

SHEENA
Whatever that means.

MASON
I don't think it means much.

SHEENA
You're kinda weird, you know that?

MASON
Yeah?

(MORE)
 
131.

MASON (CONT'D)
(Laughing)

Is that a compliment?

SHEENA
I don't know.	Do you wanna be weird?

MASON
I mean, I don't want to like... scare kids at the park, or anything like that.

Sheena laughs.

MASON (CONT'D)
I really like talking with you. I don't usually even try to like vocalize my thoughts or feelings or anything. Just, I don't know, it just never sounds right. Words are stupid.

SHEENA
So, why're you trying with me?

MASON
I don't know.	I guess I feel
comfortable.

SHEENA
I'm glad.

EXT. JIM'S HOUSE - LATER

Mason comes home late. Jim sits outside on a chair surrounded by empty beer cans and one in hand.

MASON
Hey, Jim.	I'm sorry I'm so late.

JIM
What time were you supposed to be

home?

MASON
I don't know.	Awhile ago.

JIM
Awhile ago like, thirty minutes ago, an hour ago? Cause, truthfully, nobody even knew where you were until your sister told us. She's been home for awhile.
 
132.

MASON
I'm sorry.

JIM
Yeah, been hearin' a lot of that lately. See, but you don't actually care. You just kinda... kinda come and go as you please and you don't care if your mom's upset or what time you gotta be home... Is that what's up?

MASON
I don't know what to tell you.

JIM
Stop mumbling! You know, speak up! I can't understand a word comin' outta your mouth. It's just like, "uh uhh nuhh" and I ask you questions and you just--

MASON
Man, can I just have one day where everyone isn't all over my ass!?

Jim gets up abruptly and advances on Mason.

JIM
I'm up your ass? This is my house. Now, if you wanna live in my house then you get home when you say you're gonna be home.

MASON
You know, Jim, you're not my dad.

JIM
No, I'm not your dad! You know how I know that? Cause I'm actually here. I'm the guy with the job, paying the bills, taking care of you, your mom, your sister... Huh?! Huh?!

Mason goes inside.

JIM (CONT'D)
I'm that guy...

Jim sits down.
 
133.

INT. MOM'S HOUSE - DAY

Mom sits at the kitchen table surrounded by bills and papers.
Mason comes down the stairs.

MASON
Morning.

MOM
Morning. Hey, which one of you guys used the downstairs bathroom last night?

MASON
I don't know.	I didn't.

MOM
That tall guy, what's his name?

MASON
Phillip?

MOM
Yeah, Phillip. He did it. Can Phillip read? I mean, there's a big sign on the door, it says, "Do not use this bathroom, it's broken." I mean, how difficult is that?

MASON
I don't know.	I'm sorry.

Mason prepares cereal.

MOM
I think I'm gonna put the house on the market.

MASON
Why?

MOM
This house is too big for us.	I
mean, you're going to school
eventually... It's too expensive.

I'm done.

MASON
Well why did you even buy it in the first place, then?

MOM
Because I really enjoy making poor life decisions, keeping us on the
(MORE)
 
134.

MOM (CONT'D)
brink of poverty. I mean, I've spent the first half of my life acquiring all this crap and now I'm gonna spend the second half of my life getting rid of all this stuff.

MASON
Really?	Like what?

MOM
Like - Well, I got rid of a couple
husbands, now I'm gonna get rid of a
mortgage, some maintenance, the
tchotchkes, the, the homeowner's
insurance, the property tax, the
plumbing... Ahhh.	You know what?
From now on I am gonna be Mommy Monk.
Simple.	Celibate.

MASON
Don't be gross, Mom.

MOM
Fine. I'll be a poor whore with a big house.
(Laughs)

Is that better?

MASON
Okay.

Mason starts to walk away.

MOM
Mason -- Mason, please, don't leave me that dirty dish to wash.

MASON
I do dishes all day.

MOM
Well, great honey, then you're a professional. Come on, you could do one or two more for you poor old mom.

Mason walks over to the sink.

MASON
Okay.

MOM
Thank you.
 
135.

EXT. MOM'S HOUSE

Mason gets in truck, drives away.

INT. RESTAURANT KITCHEN

Music plays in the background. Mason is in uniform, he carries in a bus tub of dirty dishes, one with uneaten battered shrimp on it. He sticks one in his mouth and flirts with APRIL, a waitress.

MASON
You want one?

APRIL
Ugh. God --

MASON
(Laughing)
She didn't even touch them, seriously.

I watched her the whole time.

April takes one.

APRIL
Yeah, I bet you did watch her, you little pervert.
(Laughing)

It's like we're on a date.	Cheers.

They clink battered shrimp.

MASON
It's a night of romance.

APRIL
Yeah, except I'm not gonna kiss you.

She heads back out to the restaurant floor.

APRIL (CONT'D)
I will blow you, though.

Mason brings the dishes over to the industrial washers. His boss, MR. WOOD, storms in.

MR. WOOD
Mason!	We are in the weeds out here!

MASON
I'm goin' as fast as I can.

MR. WOOD
Oh!

(MORE)
 
136.

MR. WOOD (CONT'D)
Then I must be confused then, cause I just saw you chattin it up with April when I gotta salad bar that needs a refill, I gotta six top, two four tops I can't use, because they haven't been bused.

MASON
Enrique is not here.	I'm tryin'.

MR. WOOD
Well, while you're tryin', we're dyin'! What am I supposed to tell my customers? "Oh, I'm sorry that your table's got dirty plates on it, but Mason's tryin'. Least that's what he told me, after he was flirtin' with April and eatin' your leftover shrimp." Now it is a challenge out there today, I know, but I wanna share somethin' with you, I got you pegged for fry cook this summer, now that's a lot more responsibility. It's also more money. How's that sound?

MASON
Good.

MR. WOOD
I know you can handle that money... but can you take the responsibility? I think you can, because I believe in you. But I need you on the floor. Now leave the dishes. Giddyup. Right, come on, don't let me down!

Mason exits.

INT. MOM'S HOUSE - DAY

Mason sits on the stairs video chatting with Dad on his phone.

DAD
Well, so it's -- it's runnin' okay? That alternator's not messin' up anymore?

MASON
(Holding Phone)
No , it's fine.	It's up for the

trip.
 
137.

DAD
(Laughing)

Well, you gonna see your sister when you guys are in Austin?

MASON
Yeah, she said I can stay at her dorm, which is cool, and I guess her roommate's out of town so it's no big deal.

DAD
Alright, well, did you apply there yet? Did you get that application in to UT?

MASON
Not yet, but Sheena's pretty much

in, though.

DAD
Yeah, right. Well, if you know that's where you wanna go, you should probably do that early acceptance thing. You know? I mean seriously, let 'em know you're a man who knows what he wants.

MASON
Yeah.

DAD
A bit of decisiveness goes a long

way in this life, alright?

MASON
Yeah.

DAD
Great.	And uh, what about work?
How's that goin'?

MASON
Uh, I don't know. It's, it's alright. Today kind of sucked, this guy didn't show up. But it's definitely an interesting perspective on the world. People are slobs.

DAD
(Laughing)

Well, when people ask me about you I say, "Oh, Mason, he's doing great. He's got a job, he's really cleanin' up."
 
138.

Mason laughs.

DAD (CONT'D)
(From Phone)

Alright, hey, hey, say hi to Annie and Cooper, will you?

Dad pans the phone to Annie and baby.

ANNIE
Say hi to your big brother.	Hey,
big brother.

MASON
Hey, Annie.	Hey, kiddo.

ANNIE
Can you say bye-bye?

BABY
Bye-buh!

ANNIE
(Laughs)

We'll see you soon.

DAD
(From phone)

Alright, alright, well, be careful when you're driving, alright? Don't be texting, don't be doing any of that. Alright? Just, you're Obi Wan. You're centered, patient, right? You watch three cars ahead, two behind. It takes two bad drivers to have an accident okay?

MASON
Okay.

DAD
(From phone)

Right, and listen, tell your sister to pick up her phone or call me back or something.

Mom comes down the stairs and drops a bag at Mason's feet.

MASON
Okay.

DAD
Alright, buddy!	You have a good
one.
 
139.

MASON
Bye, Dad.

MOM
(Motioning to the bag)
Hey, honey, take this to your sister.

Throw it in the truck, okay?

MASON
Okay, I will.

MOM
So where is Sheena staying?

MASON
At her friend Emily's.

MOM
Is Emily a real person?

MASON
(Laughing)

Yeah. Yeah, she's a sophomore. She has an apartment.

MOM
(Holding out money)
Okay, this is in case of emergency.

Don't spend it.	I want it back.

MASON
Okay.	Thanks.

MOM
Did you do your homework?

MASON
Most of it, but... I can finish

tomorrow night.

MOM
Honey! Eleventh grade is really important for college. Don't blow it.

MASON
I know! I know. I mean, we're going to UT and everything.

MOM
I know, and don't you want me to
come?	Come on, Sheena, road trip

with Mom! I'll pay for gas.
 
140.

MASON
Umm...

MOM
I'm just kidding.	I have work.

She kisses his forehead.

MOM (CONT'D)
Call me when you get there.

MASON
I will.

MOM
Have fun!

Mason exits.

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY/ INT. TRUCK

"Suburban Wars" plays. Mason drives, Sheena is in the passenger seat.

SHEENA
... That sounds to me like just
another extreme Mason view of

everything.

MASON
Not at all! I finally figured it out. It's like when they realized it was gonna be too expensive to actually build cyborgs and robots...
I mean, the costs of that were impossible. They decided to just let humans turn themselves into robots. That's what's going on right now.

SHEENA
Oh, right now?

MASON
Yeah! I mean, why not? There are billions of us just laying around, not really doing anything. We don't cost anything. I mean we're even pretty good at self-maintenance and reproducing constantly. And as it turns out, we're already biologically programmed for our little cyborg upgrades.
 
141.

SHEENA
How?

MASON
Seriously. I read this thing other day about how, like, when you hear that ding on your inbox you get a, like a dopamine rush in your brain. It's like we're being chemically rewarded for allowing ourselves to be brainwashed. How evil is that? We're fucked.

SHEENA
So you deleting your Facebook page is gonna change all that? Remember when Trevor deleted his Facebook page last year and everyone just hated him? You made more fun of him than anyone.

MASON
I still make fun of Trevor, though.

SHEENA
But it looked like he was so pathetically desperate for attention. Or to be different, or something.

MASON
That's just 'cause they did that
lame story about it in the school

paper.

SHEENA
And then he had to make a big announcement about it when he came back a month later.

MASON
That's the thing though, I'm not doing it for attention. I just want to try and not live my life through a screen. I want, like, some kind

of actual interaction. A real person, not just the profile they put up.

Sheena's looking at her phone.

SHEENA
Oh, I'm sorry.	Were you saying
something?

She laughs.
 
142.

MASON
Yeah, okay, I know you're joking, but, I mean, it's kinda true you have been, you know, checking your phone this whole time, and so what are you really doing? You don't care what your friends are up to on Saturday afternoon but you're also obviously not fully experiencing my profound bitching so... it's like everyone's just stuck in, like, an in-between state. Not really experiencing anything.

SHEENA
It's not an experience, it's just information. Look, for example, I just got the address of the club where we're meeting them later, so we won't be wandering the streets of Austin lost for an hour tonight. Thank you very much, Facebook. And I just texted my mom back.

MASON
Oh, that's -- that's groundbreaking. She hasn't seen you in, like, 55 minutes?

SHEENA
Oh!	Oh my god, most importantly,
Meg's family just got a miniature

pet pig.

Sheena hands him the phone.

MASON
(looks at phone photo)
Hm!
(Laughs)

Okay, you're right.	That is a --

SHEENA
Right?

MASON
That is a really cute, tiny pig.

Our lives can go on.

SHEENA
I want one.
 
143.

INT. POOL HALL

Gotye's "Somebody That I Used To Know" plays. Patrons chatter. Mason plays pool with Samantha's BOYFRIEND. Samantha and Sheena sit and talk.

BOYFRIEND
Nice shot.

SAMANTHA
Yeah, just give the lady at the front y'all's I.D.s and, uh, she should let you in.

SHEENA
I see.	Cool.

SAMANTHA
Yeah.

SHEENA
It's room 2-0-6, right?

SAMANTHA
Mm-hm.

SHEENA
Awesome. It's not like weird that

we're staying there?

SAMANTHA
No, it's fine.	Have fun.
(Laughs)

SHEENA (O.S.)
Thank you.	So how long have you
guys been dating?

SAMANTHA
About three months. Yeah, we met at a party and it's been, ya know, chill.

SHEENA
Yeah, he seems cool.

SAMANTHA
Yeah.	He is.

The guys are shooting pool.

SHEENA (O.S.)
Does he go to UT too?

SAMANTHA (O.S.)
Yeah.
 
144.

SHEENA
Cool.	What is he studying?

SAMANTHA
He's studying history and uh, Italian,

I	think?

The girls laugh.

SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
His minor, yeah.

SHEENA
Does he wanna... does he wanna teach?

SAMANTHA
I don't know, I think, I think he's
still figuring stuff out.	Yeah,
he'll figure it out, he's smart,
he's smart.	So where are you thinking

about living when you come here?

SHEENA
Um, I'm not really sure yet. We're gonna look at apartments tomorrow, um, but I know my parents sorta were expecting me to live in a dorm.

SAMANTHA
Yeah.

SHEENA
Yeah. But I mean, I'm paying my way through college, so it doesn't really matter that much.

SAMANTHA
Yeah, you don't have to listen to your parents after you turn eighteen. I mean, especially if they're not helping you financially.

They laugh.

SHEENA
That's what I figured.

SAMANTHA
But I mean, living in a dorm isn't so bad.

SHEENA
Yeah.
 
145.

SAMANTHA
I mean especially if it's a coed dorm. I mean, I've never been around like, so many cute guys at once. Like, college is really fun.

They laugh.

SHEENA
I'm excited.

SAMANTHA
It's great, yeah.

EXT. SIDEWALK - NIGHT

The sidewalk is populated with college students. The teens walk together in couples and pass a street musician and a woman hoola-hooping.

BOYFRIEND
Watch out.

SAMANTHA
Oh!

They laugh.

INT. CONTINENTAL CLUB - NIGHT

A four man band plays as our guys watch from the audience.

MUSICIANS
(singing)

"On the day that I was born I started growin' old. No one told you life would be so lonesome and cold. I had a grey hair by the age of 23, this hard-luck livin's gonna be the end of me. The old black crow leaving tracks all across my face, and everywhere I go I seem to be in the same damn place. Hard livin's gonna be the end of me."

EXT. CONTINENTAL CLUB - NIGHT

Sheena and Mason wander out of the club and walk up the street.

INT. CAFE - NIGHT

Sheena and Mason are seated at a table at a late-night diner, full of a variety of people.
 
146.

MAN ALONE IN BOOTH
The last death at the Hoover Dam
construction site was his son, Patrick
Tierny, who died on December 20th,
1935, exactly thirteen years to the

day.

Sheena notices a table of sorority girls and practically whispers to Mason.

SHEENA
See those sorority girls over there? I've just decided, if you delete your Facebook page, I'm pledging.

MASON
Yeah, in just a few years that's you (Indicates Girls)

And that's gonna be me.

He subtly indicates the Man Alone guy, still sitting at his booth, giving a lecture of some kind, with data, etc.

MAN ALONE IN BOOTH
...Also inlaid into the terrazzo
floors was a star map, a celestial

(Continuing Indistinct

Under)

SHEENA (O.S.)
I wonder what his deal is. I mean, he obviously has money to eat here.

MASON (O.S.)
He just said. He's a UT professor, tenure and everything.

SHEENA
Look at all these people. What are they even doing here at 3:00 in the morning?

MASON
What are WE even doing here at 3:00 in the morning?

SHEENA
We know what we're doing here.

She dips a chip into a bowl of queso.
 
147.

SHEENA (CONT'D)
Queso.	We have a purpose.

MASON
Hell yeah.

SHEENA
HELL yeah.

MASON
You know, by, like, next summer

this'll just be our lives.

SHEENA
Mm-hm.

MASON
Stayin' out all night and goin' to shows... whatever we want.

SHEENA
We ever gonna go to class?

MASON
Sometimes.

SHEENA
When it feels right.	When the
inspiration hits.

MASON
Only then.

A WAITRESS comes by their table.

WAITRESS
Anything else?

SHEENA
Uhhh... more queso?

MASON
(nodding)

Yeah.

WAITRESS
Mm-hm.

She leaves, and Mason just takes it all in.

MASON
Ah, Jesus.

SHEENA
What?
 
148.

MASON
I don't know, doesn't it all seem a little overwhelming? I mean, college? I mean, I like the idea of being away from home and gaining skills and getting better at photography.

I just, I don't know, I'm not counting on it being some big transformative experience.

SHEENA
I don't think it's that
transformative.	I just see it as

the next step.

MASON
But it's like a pre-ordained slot that's already got your name and number on it. I don't think it's the key to my future. Cause, like, I mean, look at my mom. She got her degree, and got a pretty good job, she can pay her bills...

SHEENA
Well, I like your mom.

MASON
Well, I like my mom, too. I just mean, basically, she's still just as fucking confused as I am.

Waitress drops off more queso.

SHEENA
(to Waitress)

Thank you.

MASON
Thanks.

Mason and Sheena dip chips into the bowl of queso.

EXT. SIDEWALK - NIGHT

Mason and Sheena walk on the sidewalk.

EXT. PARKING GARAGE - SUNRISE

Mason and Sheena walk across a parking garage rooftop.

They watch the sunrise. Mason stands behind her and wraps his arms around her. She turns to him and they kiss.
 
149.

INT. DORM ROOM - DAY

Mason and Sheena lie in bed under the sheets. Sam's roommate comes in.

ROOMMATE
Hello?

MASON
Hey. Um, did uh, did Sam tell you we were gonna stay here?

ROOMMATE
(laughs)

Uh -- no.

MASON
(laughs)
Sorry.	Um, she uh, she said you

were out of town for the weekend.

ROOMMATE
Yeah, I was. I just got back. Are you her... brother?

MASON
Yeah, I'm, I'm Mason.

Awkward laugh.

ROOMMATE
Right.

MASON
Um, this is Sheena.

ROOMMATE
Hello.	Uh, great.	Alright.	I'm...
gonna leave my stuff here, if it's

okay, and get something to eat and...

MASON
Okay.

ROOMMATE
... I'll just come back in a little bit...

MASON
Yeah, yeah we have to, we have to

get outta here soon anyway, so...

ROOMMATE
Alright.	It's nice meeting you.
 
150.

She turns to go.

MASON
Yeah.	You, too.

SHEENA
(under sheet)

Sorry!

The roommate exits.	Sheena and Mason hide under the sheets.

MASON
That was so awkward.

INT. SCHOOL PHOTO EXHIBIT - DAY

There is an exhibit of various art works set up. Mason enters and walks over to a series of photographs he took of Sheena. He starts to take them down. One of the school's teachers comes over.

TEACHER
Mason... silver medal winner.

Congratulations!

MASON
Thank you.

TEACHER
Heard you got a scholarship.

MASON
Yeah. Yeah, every little bit helps, you know.

TEACHER
Yeah.	When you gonna go out there?

MASON
End of the summer I think. You know, work some more before then, try to save up some money, at least.

TEACHER
Yeah, before you have to fend for

yourself.

MASON
Yeah, yeah, that's the idea.

TEACHER
Yeah.	Well how're feeling about it?
 
151.

MASON
Excited, you know. But kind of half-excited, half-terrified.

TEACHER
Yeah, kind of that voluptuous panic.

MASON
Yeah.	Exactly.

TEACHER
Well, it's gonna be good. It's gonna be crazy good. I liked college a lot better than high school. You kinda find your people in college, you know?

MASON
Exactly.

TEACHER
Well you'll be fine, you've got a good heart. Just follow your heart, yeah?

MASON
Thanks.

TEACHER
Good luck.	Don't forget to floss.

Mason's phone dings.	He takes it out.

Cell phone text message graphic:

Mason - Can't, I'll just see you tomorrow. Sheena - What's your deal? Meet me at the tree.

EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

Sheena and Mason are sitting on bleachers outside the school, under a tree overlooking a practice field. They are in mid-argument.

SHEENA
I just don't get why you're being so fucking childish.

MASON
I'm not being childish. You're the one who made it into this big thing by telling everyone.

SHEENA
I haven't told anyone.
 
152.

MASON
So Cynthia just magically knows you're going to the prom with this loser even though you're not dating him anymore?

SHEENA
She's my best friend.

MASON
Well, your best friend has a big

fucking mouth.

SHEENA
Take it up with her, then.

MASON
Why don't you just tell Miss Fuckin' Rubber Jaws she can keep on talking as long as she includes the truth, which is that we wouldn't be having this conversation if your college boyfriend weren't out of town this weekend.

SHEENA
You had already bought the tickets. It's just prom, it's not like it matters. I'm just tryin' to be friends with you.

MASON
Now it's just humiliating.	I can't...
I can't do that.

SHEENA
Mister I-Don't-Care-What-Anyone-Else-

Thinks-Of-Me.

MASON
Fuck anyone else. I care what I think of me. Which isn't much right now. King of the Pity Prom.

SHEENA
Fine.	We're not going.

MASON
Great.

A long pause.
 
153.

SHEENA
Why are we even... I mean, we both knew this was coming. I'm just the one who did something about it.

MASON
Yeah, fucking some college guy...

SHEENA
Oh, fuck you!
(a beat)

I don't regret anything.

MASON
(Bitter Laugh)

Of course you don't.

SHEENA
You know, it's actually kind of a relief not to have to be around someone who's so gloomy all the time. The world's not so horrible. Not everything's some big conspiracy against humanity.

MASON (O.S.)
It's great that you can think that way. And you know, I'm sure dating a jock really helps to clear the mind.

SHEENA
He's not a jock, okay? He just happens to be on the lacrosse team. We're all going to other schools next year anyway, it's not some super serious relationship.

MASON
Great.	I feel so much better now.

SHEENA
We're just having fun.

MASON
I bet he's having fun.

SHEENA
Grow up, Mason.

MASON
It's not like I haven't been with

anyone else.
 
154.

SHEENA
Who?

MASON
What do you care?

SHEENA
Who?

MASON
Does it matter?

SHEENA
You're the one who brought it up.

A pause.

SHEENA (CONT'D)
This is pointless.

She gets up and starts to walk away.

SHEENA (CONT'D)
Now you're just trying to be an

asshole.

EXT./INT. NICK'S CAR

Nick drives Mason home from graduation.

NICK
Holy Crap, I would rather have my balls clawed off than ever sit through anything like that ever again!

MASON
Well, we never, ever have to.

NICK
Oh my god, thank you.

MASON
Gimme that.

Nick hands him a flask.

NICK
Dude, it's all you. Drink up. So you coming out with me tonight, brother? Should be some pretty awesome stuff happening.
 
155.

MASON
Naw, dude, I'm goin' to this like, show with my dad in Austin. His friend's playing.

NICK
Gosh, have fun with that, I guess.

Nick pulls into Mason's driveway and parks.

MASON
Fuck, there's so many cars here. I don't wanna go in there.

NICK
(sarcastic)

Dude, you will have so much fun. Your family loves you. You'll have a swell time.

MASON
Fuck you.	You're coming in with me.

NICK
Oh, no.	Shit no.	No.

MASON
Yes!	Yes, you are.	My mom loves
you.	You have to say hi.

NICK
Just --

MASON
Do you want to hurt her feelings?

NICK
Mm-mm.

(Shakes head slightly)

MASON
Well then, let's go get 'em.

NICK
Just for a second. Just a second, seriously.

Nick "tests" his breath in his hand. They get out of the car.

INT. MOM'S HOUSE - GRADUATION PARTY - DAY

Family and friends chit chat throughout the house. Mom prepares snacks, while Dad and Annie talk with UNCLE STEVE.
 
156.

UNCLE STEVE
You know you're in sort of in enemy territory here.

DAD
(laughing)

We're aware.

INT. KITCHEN - GRADUATION PARTY - CONTINUOUS Cake graphic: "Congratulations Mason!"

DAD
Uh, look who's here!

ALL
(cheer, applause)

...Whooo!

MOM
Hey!

She hugs Mason.

UNCLE STEVE
Get a job!

Mason takes off his graduation cap.

MOM
No-no-no-no, wait.	We're gonna take
pictures.	Put it back on.
(To Carol)
Hey, can you get a camera?
(To Nick)

Hey Nick!

Grandma comes over and hugs Mason.

GRANDMA
Oh! Back on. Oh... Congratulations, baby.
(to Nick)

I don't know you, but congratulations!

She hugs him too.

GRANDMA (CONT'D)
Oh, pictures, pictures, Carol.
 
157.

MOM (O.S.)
Quick, put your hat on.

CAROL
Alright, look here...

They pose and Carol takes the picture with a phone.

MOM
Smile.

CAROL
Here we go.	Oh, that's a good one.
And... good!	Got it.

GRANDMA (O.S.)
Oh, we need -- Sam, where are you?

Samantha!

MOM
Sam!

GRANDMA
And where's Mason senior? I'm feeling generous.
(to Dad)

Come here.

Another picture is taken.

CAROL
Great. And... beautiful! I'll email these to everyone.

Uncle Steve stands up and points his finger at Dad.

DAD
(to Uncle Steve)

No, don't even start, don't start, don't start.

INT. LIVING ROOM - GRADUATION PARTY - CONTINUOUS

The guests help themselves to the array of dishes and appetizers on the table. Buffet style. Mason drifts into a conversation with Carol and her daughter Abbey.

MASON
Can't believe you guys came all this way. It means a lot to me.

CAROL
We wouldn't have missed it for
anything!	I'm so proud of you.

(MORE)
 
158.

CAROL (CONT'D)
Congratulations.	I'm really sorry
that Lee couldn't be here.	He's on
his Senior Trip.

MASON
No, no.	Tell him I said hi.

CAROL
I will.

SAMANTHA
Abby, I didn't even recognize you.

How old are you now?

ABBY
I'm thirteen.

SAMANTHA
Wow.

Mason's boss, Mr. Wood, enters.

INT. KITCHEN - GRADUATION PARTY - CONTINUOUS

Across the room, Professor Douglas has her ever-present wine glass.

PROFESSOR DOUGLAS
(Pouring wine)
Alright, let's top her off.	You

want some, doll?

WOMAN AT PARTY
Um... Sure, whatever.	Yeah, totally.

PROFESSOR DOUGLAS
Yeah, sure why not.

MR. WOOD
(To Mason)

I got you something.

MASON
What is it?

MR. WOOD
That is a savings bond. That is worth something. It's better than money - you'd just spend that.

MASON
Yeah.
 
159.

MR. WOOD
God - is that your mom?

MASON
Yeah, yeah.	That's her.

MR. WOOD
Wow.

One of the little cousins drops fruit.

UNCLE STEVE
It'll be -- three second rule. Put it on your plate.

WOMAN AT PARTY
(laughing)

Such a good dad.	Really.

UNCLE STEVE
I know, I'm trying to help.

MOM (O.S.)
Come here, you guys. I want to make a little toast to Mason.

She holds up her glass of wine.

GUESTS
(reacting)

Whoo!	Yeah!	Alright!

MOM
Now Mason, I know you really didn't want to have a party today but... we did.

Laughter.

MOM (CONT'D)
And you only graduate high school once in your life... So I want to celebrate you and this next phase.
And you're going to learn so much in college. You're going to have so much fun. You're going to have inspiring teachers. You're going to learn more about your art. I love you babe. I'm so proud of you... To Mason.

ALL
To Mason!

(MORE)
 
160.

ALL (CONT'D)
(indistinguishable
chatter)

Hear!	Hear!

UNCLE STEVE
(to Dad)

Alright, you're up, kid.

DAD
Oh, uh... Alright, uh, well... Mason, I'll make a toast to the future. To your future. You know, it's been a little sketchy this... end of the school year here, trying to figure out what school to go to. Mason told me that, uh, he wanted...to get as far away from home as possible. But still honor our agreement that we pay in-state tuition, which I do appreciate. He's a prudent man, and uh, he's going to have a great future. So, here's to you buddy.

GUESTS
(reacting)

Whoo!	Future!

DAD
Congratulations.

UNCLE STEVE
Mason Junior! High school graduate, eighteen and straight! Ha-ha-ha!

Dad subtly puts his hand over his brother's mouth and pats his chest.

DAD
Alright, that's enough. Just ignore him. My brother needs to learn to pace himself.

MR. WOOD
Well, I've not known you as long as everybody here, but uh, since I have known you, you've grown a lot. And uh, I don't know, I'm proud of you. So if this photography thing doesn't work out, you know you always got a job. Lose that earring. But, uh, you know, maybe I can get you in front of house. Alright, to you buddy!
 
161.

MOM
Sam, say something!

DAD (O.S.)
Come on, Samantha.

GRANDMA
Come on, darlin'.

SAMANTHA
(hesitating)

Good luck?

Mom and Mason embrace. A little later, Professor Douglas has Mason cornered.

PROFESSOR DOUGLAS
So you broke up with your girlfriend?

MASON
Yeah, yeah, just recently.

PROFESSOR DOUGLAS
What was her name?

MASON
Sheena.

PROFESSOR DOUGLAS
Sheena.	She's... gonna go to college
with you?

MASON
No.

PROFESSOR DOUGLAS
No, oh.

MASON
She's staying in this part of Texas.

PROFESSOR DOUGLAS
Oh, okay.	You need a ride to college?

INT. LIVING ROOM - GRADUATION PARTY - CONTINUOUS

Dad and Annie talk to Grandma.

GRANDMA
I just wanted to say hello before

you got out of here. I haven't gotten a chance --
 
162.

DAD
You guys met before, haven't you?

Annie, Catherine...

ANNIE
Yeah, yeah, we met at uh--

GRANDMA
Sam's graduation.

DAD
Oh yeah.

ANNIE
Yes, that's right.

GRANDMA
And with your little one. Where is he?

ANNIE
Oh, he's at home.

DAD
Yeah, yeah. Remember, he was such a pain at Sam's thing that, you know...

GRANDMA
Oh, I would love to see him.

ANNIE
Well, we have a special weekend this weekend, so...

GRANDMA
I'm so glad you found her. I really am.
(to Annie)

You, you've got him at a good time, I think.

ANNIE
I think so, too.

GRANDMA
Yeah.	It's good to see you two.

DAD
Nice to see you, too, Catherine.

GRANDMA
I'm so proud of your boy.

DAD
Yeah, yeah we all are.
 
163.

Grandma walks off.	Dad whispers to Annie.

DAD (CONT'D)
If you think she's a bitch now, you should have seen her fucking twenty years ago.

They laugh.

INT. DEN - GRADUATION PARTY - CONTINUOUS

Later, Uncle Steve, Dad, and Mason have a manly discussion.

UNCLE STEVE
You got to remember, you're going to college, though, alright? And if you're anything like me or your old man, you're gonna be pulling down some serious wool. You're gonna be tapping some masterful gap.

DAD
Steven...

UNCLE STEVE
You're gonna be doing some good work out there. Think about it, awful lot of flowers in that bouquet.
But, you gotta do me a favor. You're going to be vulnerable this summer, alright. Remember to use protection during breakup sex.

He puts his hand on Dad.

UNCLE STEVE (CONT'D) This guy knows exactly of which I speak. Look what happened to him. Viola'.

Uncle Steve gestures to Mason.

DAD
Steven...

UNCLE STEVE
(laughing)

Cheers.

DAD
It's not that simple.
 
164.

UNCLE STEVE
(chanting)
Four more years.	Four more years.

I'm just saying.

INT. KITCHEN - GRADUATION PARTY - CONTINUOUS

Later Dad enters the kitchen where Mom happens to be.

DAD
Do y'all recycle?	Should I --

MOM
I have one started there.

DAD
Oh, yeah, right. Okay, great. Okay. Am I, uh, am I your only ex at this party?

MOM
Yes, but I'm not your only wife here, though.

DAD
Yeah.

MOM
Can you believe they're both out of high school?

DAD
No.	No, I can't.
(a beat)
You did a great job with both of

them, by the way.

MOM
Thanks for saying that.	I never
thought I'd hear you say that.

DAD
Well, it's true.	Thank you.

MOM
And you're doing it all over again, huh?

DAD
I know, I know, right? It's gonna be uh, fifteen years till I have an empty nest. But hey, I'd love to pitch in, help with this, if I could.
(MORE)
 
165.

DAD (CONT'D)
I mean, it's so great that you did this. I was just going to give you a little. I'd appreciate it if I could.

He pulls out his wallet.

MOM
Sure.	Yeah.

DAD
Yeah. But I don't have any cash. It's in Annie's purse. I'll be right back.

INT. ANTONE'S - EVENING

Mason and Dad are wandering through the green room area while the band is doing a sound check.

DAD
...So it sucks. I mean, the guy's a college lacrosse player. I mean, what are you gonna do?

MASON
She didn't even like sports.

An iced-down bucket of drinks beckons.

DAD
You want a beer?

MASON
No, that's alright.

DAD
You can have one.

MASON
It's okay.

They continue their conversation out of the green room to a little area overlooking the stage.

DAD
Yeah, well, for what it's worth, we've all been through the exact same thing, at one point or another.

MASON
It's not the same, though. I mean, you never got to know her.
 
166.

DAD
No, I know, I know.	It's not the
same.

MASON
I just don't know what I did wrong.

At this point Dad yells down to Jimmy, his roommate from years before, briefly interrupting the sound check.

DAD
Hey, Jimmy.	Hey, man.	Hey --

JIMMY
Hey, Mason.

DAD
We're up here raiding the green room.

Hope that's okay.

JIMMY
That's totally cool.

DAD
Alright.

JIMMY
Wow!	Is that M.J.?

DAD
Uh-huh.	Right?

JIMMY
Unbelievable.

DAD
Well, we just decided to come a little early, check you out.

JIMMY
That's cool man, let me finish up,

I'll be up in a minute.

DAD
Alright, alright.

He and Mason slowly start to drift around the venue.

DAD (CONT'D)
(back to Mason)

I guarantee you, you didn't do anything wrong. These high school love things, they never work out. Here, come here.

(MORE)
 
167.

DAD (CONT'D)
I mean, everyone's just changing so much. The odds of two young people staying on the same wavelength are...

MASON
Yeah, but still --

DAD
Look, and I also guarantee you that every day of your life that you spend crying over some silly girl is a complete waste of time.

MASON
She wasn't a silly girl, though. I mean, she's a serious person. I really thought we were --

DAD
What?

MASON
I don't know.

DAD
Here's the truth. Women are never satisfied. Ok? They're always looking to potentially trade up and that's, I'm sorry to say, what I think has happened to you my fine feathered friend.

MASON
What does that even mean?

DAD
It means don't hand over the controls to your self-esteem to Sheila.

MASON
Sheena.

DAD
Alright. It means you are responsible for you, not your girlfriend, not your mom, not me. You. And if you truly take care of you, you will be amazed at how much girls like Sheena start lining up at your front door.

MASON
Great.
 
168.

DAD
Yeah, you know, you just gotta separate yourself from the pack in some way. Excel at something, you know, and then you have your pick of the litter when them front-running hussies start sniffing around.

MASON
So what you're saying is, I should take up lacrosse.

DAD
Exactly. Or you could, you know, start a band. Worked for me a long time ago. I think it's still working for Jimmy. Or you just keep taking pictures.

MASON
She hated the pictures I took of

her.

DAD
Alright. I'm sick to death of her, okay? I only met her a few times and yes she was cute, alright. But, truth be told I always thought she was a little bit, you know, a little bit too square for you. Y'know, not quite the same vibe.

MASON
You really thought that?

DAD
On some subtle, lower level. I mean, uh, I wasn't surprised when it turned out she was interested in some knucklehead lacrosse player, okay?
I mean, bottom line is, it's all timing with these things. Y'know. I mean, uh, take your mom and me. Y'know I think I probably turned into the boring castrated guy she wanted me to be fifteen or twenty years ago, y'know? And man I'm not saying she was wrong to be pissed. I'm not, I'm just saying that, y'know, she could have been a little more patient... a little more forgiving.

MASON
Would've saved me that parade of

drunken assholes.
 
169.

Dad gestures zipping his lip, saying nothing.

MASON (CONT'D)
So what's the point?

DAD
Of what?

MASON
I don't know, any of this.

Everything.

DAD
Everything? What's the point? I mean I sure as shit don't know. I mean, but, neither does anybody else. Okay, we're all just winging it, you know? I mean the good news is you're feeling stuff. You know? And you got to hold onto that. You do. I mean you get older and you don't feel as much. You're skin gets tougher. The point is those pictures you took. Thousands of submissions from all over the state and you won.

MASON
Well, I got silver. And nine other people did, too.

DAD
I'm gonna kill you. I'm tryin' to tell you that I believe in you, Mason. I think you're really special, and if some girl doesn't see that, then fuck her, y'know?

Jimmy's at the mic.

JIMMY (O.S.)
Hey, this next one goes out to a

young man in the house --

DAD
Woo-oho!

JIMMY
Known him since he was just a small boy, now he's all graduated from high school, making me feel old. Happy high school graduation, Mason.

He plays his guitar, and the band kicks in... sounding pretty great.
 
170.

INT. CAFE - DAY

Mom, Mason and Samantha sit down at a table. A waitress places menus.

MOM
Thank you.	Okay guys, let's be clear.
I'm going to break this into four
categories.	One.	Anything you wanna
keep from your childhood and your
taking with you.	Two.	Throwing
away.	Three.	Donating.	Four.
Whatever you wanna try to sell at
the garage sell next weekend, whatever

we don't sell, we're donating.

MASON
Doesn't the apartment have like an attic, or storage or something?

MOM
No. You're missing the point. We're not going to drag a bunch of crap to mom's tiny apartment.

SAMANTHA
Can't believe we're moving again.

MOM
No, I'm moving! You moved two years ago. You have an apartment in Austin. Mason is moving the fall. I'm done. This will be great for me. I'll have all these options. I could take a sabbatical. I could get some writing done and try to get published.

MASON
What about Christmas, though? What are we gonna do?

SAMANTHA
I'm not sharing a room with him.

MOM
One of you will sleep on the couch, and we'll use that blow-up mattress.

SAMANTHA
How am I supposed to do my laundry?

MOM
Sam, I'm gently pushing you out of the nest.

(MORE)
 
171.

MOM (CONT'D)
And on your way down you may magically find some quarters that you use to
do laundry in your own apartment. Come on! You guys are adults. You need to take some responsibility! And what do you want?

Mom puts her glasses on.

MASON
I'm gonna get the veggie burger.

SAMANTHA
I'm not having anything, not hungry.

Mom takes her glasses off.

MOM
What's wrong with you?

SAMANTHA
I'm sick.

MOM
What is it, your head? Do you have a fever?

MASON
She's pregnant.

SAMANTHA
(weak laugh)

No. To be honest, I drank way too much last night.

MOM
You weren't driving, were you?

SAMANTHA
No. No. Carrie's back home, too, and we just hung out. You know, peach Smirnoffs, they just go down so easy.

MOM
No, no. Hey - that's not an excuse. You can still pack boxes. These people want to move in as soon as possible.

The assistant restaurant manager, who'll we'll come to know as ERNESTO, approaches the table.
 
172.

ERNESTO
Hi guys.	I'm Ernesto, how are you?
(to Mom)

Uh, you probably don't remember me, but I worked on your septic line years ago.

MOM
Oh, yeah.

ERNESTO
Believe it or not, you changed my life. Yeah, you told me that day that I was smart and that I should go to school. I took your advice! I signed up for English classes and then a year later I went to community college and I got my associates degree. And I'm working on my bachelors now at Texas State. And I'm also one of the managers here.

MOM
That's great.

ERNESTO
Uh, it's good to see you. Because I really wanted a chance to thank you for that. Gracias. It really meant a lot to me. Don't worry about lunch. It's on me. It's the least I can do.

MOM
Thanks.

ERNESTO
You guys should listen to her. She's a smart lady.

MOM
Thank you.

Ernesto walks back toward the kitchen, leaving the three seated at the table.

EXT. APARTMENT - MORNING

Mason, now with a scruffy beard, is wedging a duffel bag and bin into the bed of his truck. He walks back toward Mom's new apartment.
 
173.

INT. APARTMENT - MORNING

Mason is packing a box, in mid-conversation with Mom, who is seated in another room.

MASON
...Isn't that kind of crazy though, that a computer knows who you are from just twenty questions off a form? I guess there are really only like eight types of people in the world.

Mom goes to the kitchen and pours coffee into a mug.

MASON (CONT'D)
I mean there are subsets, like male and female, but apparently we're not as unique as we want to think we are.

MOM
Have you even talked to this guy

yet?

MASON
No, but we've been trading emails. He seems pretty cool. He's studying literature, and uh, anthropology, and he's way into Bright Eyes... so that's not so bad. But anyways, he was telling me about how the system they use for assigning roommates is kind of spooky. Like, the Freshmen satisfaction rate for new roommates used to be like 60%, and now it's 100%. Just cause of the computer.

MOM
Well. Sounds like he'll be a good roommate, then.

MASON
Yeah. But we've pretty much decided that soon they won't even need a questionnaire. Because they'll just let the NSA scan your digital ghost, and they'll tell you who your roommate is, based on everything you've ever said, written, or clicked.

Mason walks back into the living room, carrying a box. He holds up a framed picture.
 
174.

MASON (CONT'D)
Did you -- Did you put this in here again?

Mom laughs.

MASON (CONT'D)
I don't want it.

MOM
Come on, it's the first picture you ever took.

MASON
Well, I mean, all the more reason to leave it behind, right?

Mason goes to put the picture back in his room, while Mom suddenly breaks into quiet sobs.

He comes back out, wearing a backpack, and notices Mom crying.

MASON (CONT'D)
What?

MOM
(crying)

Nothing.

MASON
No, what is it?

MOM
Nothing!

MASON
Mom...

MOM
This is the worst day of my life.

MASON
What are you talking about?

MOM
I knew this day was coming. I just -- I didn't know you were gonna be so fuckin' happy to be leaving.

MASON
I mean, it's not that I'm that happy.

What do you, what do you expect?
 
175.

MOM
You know what I'm realizing? My life is just gonna go, like that! This series of milestones. Getting married, having kids, getting divorced, the time that we thought you were dyslexic, when I taught you how to ride a bike, getting divorced AGAIN, getting my masters degree, finally getting the job I wanted, sending Samantha off to college, sending YOU off the college... You know what's next? Huh? It's my fuckin' funeral!

A beat.

MOM (CONT'D)
Just go, and leave my picture!

Stunned, Mason doesn't know what to say.

MASON
Aren't you jumping ahead by like,

forty years or something?

MOM
I just thought there would be more.

Mom sits at the table crying. Mason does not know how to comfort her.

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

Mason drives his pick-up truck through the open roads and mountains of West Texas.

EXT. GAS STATION - DAY

Mason stops at a gas station to fill up. While he waits, he takes pictures.

EXT. UNIVERSITY - DAY

Mason pulls into the parking lot of his University and parks.

INT. DORM - AFTERNOON

Mason walks through a hallway area and finds his dorm room. He enters to find it half decorated with music going. He throws his bag up on the available bed and starts to unpack and get situated. DALTON enters.

DALTON
Hey, you must be Mason.
 
176.

MASON
Yeah.	Dalton, right?

DALTON
Yeah, man, it's nice to finally meet you.

MASON
Definitely.

DALTON
Are you cool with this side of the room?

MASON
Yeah.

DALTON
Got in this morning, just moved my shit in, man.

MASON
(laughs)
Well, yeah.	I don't- I don't care.

No worries.

He unzips his bag, but keeps the conversation going.

DALTON
Cool. Can I help with anything, man? Any bags? Any last stuff you need brought in?

MASON
I just got like one... box left, I packed pretty light. But I appreciate it.

DALTON
My pleasure, man.	Of course.

MASON
Um, are you goin' to the orientation mixer thing?

DALTON
Orientation mixer thing? Fuck no, man! I'm not goin' to that and neither are you, by the way. We got way better stuff to be doin', dude.

BARB, Dalton's girlfriend, drifts into the room.

BARB
You ready?
 
177.

DALTON
Yeah.	Hey, Barb, this' my roommate
Mason.	Mason, Barb.

They shake.

MASON
Hi.

BARB
Hey.	You comin' with us?

MASON
Where're you going?

BARB
Hiking.

DALTON
Yeah, man, you should come. If we leave now we can catch the late afternoon at Big Bend. You ever been before, man?

MASON
Yeah.	But not since I was really
little.

DALTON
Oh, well then all the more reason to come now, man. That's why we're here, dude.

Barb's roommate, NICOLE, is now hanging out by the door.

DALTON (CONT'D)
Oh, Mason. This is Nicole, Barb's roommate.

NICOLE
Hey, what's up?

MASON
Hi.

Barb is reaching in her bag for something.

DALTON
Mason, Nicole.

BARB
(to Mason)

So, you game?
 
178.

MASON
Sure.

She has produced a chunk of brownie that she hands to Mason.

BARB
Here. Have the rest of this. Got it timed perfectly. It'll kick in when we get to the mountains.

Mason takes it, a little amused, looks at the others (confirmation), then starts to consume.

MASON
Awesome.

DALTON (O.S.)
Let's go.

They roll out of there.

EXT. BIG BEND - LATE AFTERNOON

Mason, Nicole, Dalton and Barb hike through a BIG canyon.
Nicole talks to Mason about teaching dance.

MASON
Do they let you major in that here?

NICOLE
Well, it's not that serious here, so I kinda like train outside the university, but I'm taking all my basics like History of Dance and all that.

MASON
Nice.

NICOLE
Yeah.

MASON
What do you teach?

NICOLE
Oh, gosh. Ballet, tap, jazz, lyrical, hip-hop...

MASON
Wow.	Which one's your favorite?

NICOLE
Tap.
 
179.

MASON
Yeah?

NICOLE
Yeah. You can make up all your own sounds and there's no rules.

MASON
Right...

NICOLE
Just, like, creative freedom.

MASON
That's great.

NICOLE
Yeah.

MASON
Right.

NICOLE
... So to be a part of bringing it back to the kids...

MASON
Right, keep it going.

NICOLE
... Is really rewarding.	Yeah.

MASON
How old are they?

NICOLE
Six to eight.

MASON
(laughs)

Wow.

NICOLE
(laughing)

Yeah. They have like no fear, and they're not self-conscious at all.

MASON
They haven't reached the awkward

years yet.

NICOLE
Yeah, not yet.	It's coming.
 
180.

The group continues walking over a ridge as the sun is setting.

EXT. HIKE - LATER

As Barb and Dalton coyote call on the rocks, Mason joins Nicole sitting on a rock overlooking the river and sunset.

NICOLE
Hey.

Dalton and Barb continue like coyotes, much to Nicole and Mason's amusement.

NICOLE (CONT'D)
Dalton can be crazy sometimes.

MASON
He seems cool, though.

NICOLE
Yeah.	Yeah, they're both really
cool.	How are you feeling?

They both laugh.

MASON
Great.	Really great, to be honest.

NICOLE
Good. I'm really happy that you're hangin' out with us.

MASON
Yeah.	Me too.

Meanwhile, over on a big rock, the coyotes are now yelling words.

DALTON (O.S.)
This moment's having a multiple orgasm! It's like as if all of time has unfolded before us so we can stand here and look out and scream - Fuck yea!! Wooo!

Back with Nicole and Mason laughing.

NICOLE
You know how everyone's always saying, "Seize the moment"?

Mason nods yes.
 
181.

NICOLE (CONT'D)
I don't know, I'm kinda thinkin' it's the other way around. You know, like, the moment seizes us.

MASON
Yeah. Yeah, I know. It's constant, the moments, it's just... it's like always right now, you know?

NICOLE
Yeah.

They trade smiles.

FADE OUT
