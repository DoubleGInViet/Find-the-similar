INT.	WARD’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY

SCOTT WARD can’t sleep. He scowls in defiance at the golden midday sun scorching through the blinds. Plain but handsome, with an ‘I’m in charge here’ buzzcut. A thoughtful man, but no genius, he’s stymied by the daylight. We note the ANGRY BRUISING on his 200-pushups-a-day chest.

Ward tries to fall back asleep. No dice. He shifts his weight and peels his Glock off his sweaty back. Sighs and starts counting the cracks in his bedroom ceiling...

SMASH TO:


EXT.	LIQUOR STORE - WARD’S FLASHBACK	- DAY

A GANGBANGER in a black hoodie bursts out the door with a shotgun! WARD stands there in LAPD uniform. Reaches for his holster -- Breaks leather. Steps into a textbook shooting stance. Muzzle coming on target. Too Late...

The GANGBANGER spins aims fires -- KABOOM!


INT.	WARD’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY

Ward gasps awake. His fingertips skim the ugly green and purple bruises on his chest. I’m still alive...


INT.	WARD’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

Ward shuffles into the kitchen -- Sees SHERRI, his age, inspecting dishes in the sink, looking for the easiest one to wash. Pretty in a champagne room kind of way. She has an air of entitlement, things should’ve been easier for her.

The tension between them is palpable. Ward grabs a huge box of Cheerios, fills a plastic bowl. Without looking up:

SHERRI
There’s a fairy in the bird feeder again.

Ward sighs.	Gets the milk from the fridge.	Smells it.
Expired.	Pours it anyway.

SHERRI (CONT’D)
It’s the same fuckin’ one, too. Isn’t it? Cause you didn’t kill it last time.
 
2.


Ward steels himself as he tamps cornflakes into sour milk. He’s been over her shit for a long time -- His tone immediately counters her aggression, mellow, even...

WARD
I thought you were out looking for a job.

SHERRI
Oh. Right. Of course. Of course you’d bring that up.

WARD
Yesterday you indicated you would be actively looking for employment. We had a plan, a timeline. And I’m concerned--

SHERRI
--Don’t.	Don’t do that.

WARD
Do what?

SHERRI
Your Zen cop ‘I’m talking to a

crazy person’ voice you do.

WARD
...I’m trying to not escalate...

SHERRI
For your information, I had an

interview this morning.

WARD
Okay.	That’s good.

SHERRI
I don’t need you to tell me it’s

good.	I won’t fuckin’ get it.

WARD
How do you know?

SHERRI
Because I can tell.	Okay?	The
woman was a snotty bitch.

WARD
Keep at it. Your next interviewer might be a man. You can shake your six thousand dollar bolt-on-tits at him.
 
3.


SHERRI
Way to de-escalate asshole. We all know I can make more money than your broke ass ever will dancing. So fuck you. Sophie’s staying at mom’s tonight. You gotta give her a ride. And get the fuckin’ fairy. Kill it this time. Pussy.

She grabs her keys and charges out of there.


EXT.	WARD’S HOUSE - FRONT YARD - DAY

Ward peers through the bars of his shitty Craftsman in South Central LA. Gangster THUMP emanates from the house next door. Two Low Riders on the lawn, cabled together. HOMIES solemnly gathered around open hoods.

Ward slides the Glock in his pocket. Grabs a broom. Steps out into the sunlight -- His neighbor MIGUEL clocks him.

MIGUEL
Good afternoon officer. We didn’t wake you up?

He salutes. Ward salutes back, on a mission, not slowing down...

WARD
No, never. Because bass doesn’t carry at all. You know that’s bad for the grass. The cars.

MIGUEL
Grass grows back.	How’s your old
lady?

WARD
Save up your lunch money and ask

her yourself.

The Homies sense his venom and wince -- Damnnnn.

MIGUEL
Yo, that fairy in your bird feeder’s been up in my pad eating my dog food. I’m a call the city.

WARD
I am the city.	Motherfucker’s
about to go to Fairy Heaven.
 
4.


Ward approaches the bird feeder slowly. A dead pigeon lays beneath it -- Badly burnt. Ward stops and thinks. He doesn’t need this shit. Raises the broom...

The Homies look on, expectant, as they slowly back up...

Ward gently pokes the bird feeder.	Nothing.

THEN: The FAIRY bursts out SCREECHING at him! A sparrow-sized hybrid of lemur and insect. It HISSES like vermin...

MIGUEL
Aw shit.	Ring the bell.	It’s on.

Ward jabs it with the broom -- It flings a handful of sparks at him!

WARD
Ah!	Fuck!

The Homies erupt into laughter. Ward ignores them, locked onto his enemy. He fakes left, spins, swats it against the house with a thud -- The Fairy drops to the ground, HISSING, helpless, injured...

MIGUEL
That’s it right there. LAPD style. Now watch him finish off the little homie.

Ward advancing slowly, clearly pitying the fairy -- It throws sparks again -- Ward looks away and brings down the broom with finality -- He’s sprayed with purple blood.

This gets the expected eruption from the onlookers...


INT.	WARD’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

Ward returns and regards his forgotten bowl of soggy cereal. His mind tumbles, something washes over his face. He’s suddenly somewhere else...


EXT.	LIQUOR STORE - WARD’S FLASHBACK - DAY

Ward is on his back next to the front tire of his black and white. He’s stunned. The buckshot in his vest smoking. The Gangbanger steps around the corner of the vehicle. Presses the shotgun to Ward’s forehead -- His eyes locked onto the face of holy motherfucking death itself. A face we don’t get to see yet...
 
5.


CLICK. The shotgun is jammed. The Gangbanger takes off running. ECU WARD -- Gritting his teeth in rage...


INT.	WARD’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

He shakes his head, wiping his face...

SOPHIA (O.S.)
Daddy!


INT.	WARD’S HOUSE - SOPHIA’S BEDROOM - DAY

Ward's little daughter SOPHIA tries to cram a mound of stuffed animals into her backpack. Ward sits on her bed, eating a banana.

SOPHIA
They don’t fit.

WARD
So just take a couple. You’re only going to Grandma’s for one night.

SOPHIA
If I only take two the rest will

miss them.

WARD
You’re very considerate. But what about like clothes and toothbrushes and socks and stuff?

SOPHIA
Daddy I’m only going for one night.

Ward laughs.	Then...

SOPHIA (CONT’D)
Are you in trouble?

WARD
Am I in trouble?	Did mom say
something?

SOPHIA
Mom said you and Nick are in trouble because Nick did something dumb.

Ward makes a mental note -- Total information lockdown time with Sherry. Before he can craft a response...
 
6.


SOPHIA (CONT’D)
Kayla at school says orcs do dumb stuff because they’re not as smart as people. Did Nick get you in trouble? I don’t want you be in trouble.

Ward speaks carefully.

WARD
Orcs aren’t dumb.	Okay?	All the
races are different than us.	And
being different doesn’t make them
smarter or dumber.	They’re just
like us.	Okay?	Everyone just
wants to get along and be happy.

SOPHIA
Can elves really talk to dragons?

WARD
Not unless they go to the zoo.

SOPHIA
Kayla says--

WARD
--you gotta stop listening to Kayla. Kayla sounds like trouble.

SOPHIA
No, Kayla never gets in trouble.

WARD
Not yet. Being so judgemental won’t do Kayla any favors in life. Look. Don’t let anyone tell you what to think. Treat everyone nice and they’ll treat you nice.

Suddenly a crash outside -- KATHUNK! -- Ward reacts, quickly gets up...


EXT.	WARD’S HOUSE - DAY

Ward exits and sees an LAPD Black and White on his lawn.

WARD
Aw come on.	What the actual fuck?

NICK JAKOBY, early 30s, exits from the driver’s side with a grin -- By the way -- JAKOBY’S AN ORC...
 
7.


Like most orcs, he’s bald with green skin, orange eyes and slightly animalistic facial features. He’s friendly and easy going, but right now he’s gently on the defensive.

JAKOBY
What?	They put new shocks in.	I
was testing them on your curb.

WARD
On my curb?	That makes no sense.

JAKOBY
Your driveway’s full?

From next door...

MIGUEL
Hey officer, that’s bad for the

grass.

WARD
Yes.	Thank you.	It grows back.
(to Jakoby)

Why are you here in our car?

JAKOBY
I had that diversity training thing up at Elysian. Thought you were going.

WARD
I did it. You can’t run errands in a city car.

JAKOBY
Your house is on the way to the

barn.	Hop in.	Let’s go to work.

SOPHIA
Hi Nick!

Sophia exits with a big smile for Jakoby...

JAKOBY
Hey Sophia, what’s up rockstar?

SOPHIA
We’re packing for grandma’s.

JAKOBY
That’s cool.
 
8.


WARD
Will you shut up, bro?	I don’t
want you catching days over a

stupid mileage beef.

SOPHIA
Don’t tell Nick to shut up, he’s a person too!

JAKOBY
Enlightened kid there, Scott.


EXT./INT.	SOUTH LA/COP CAR (MOVING) - DAY

Jakoby drives. Sophia in back listening to headphones. Ward quietly seethes...

JAKOBY
What?

WARD
This is stupid. I’m in soft clothes with my kid in the car. If we get popped.

JAKOBY
Right. Because maybe Internal Affairs is running integrity stings on vehicle mileage this week.

WARD
You suck at sarcasm.	You’re
supposed to use a sarcastic tone

when you’re being sarcastic.

JAKOBY
I put what, five extras miles on the car? A buck of gas. That’s a criminal violation. Bro we gotta deny everything. Delete Facebook and lawyer up.

WARD
Exactly like that.	A sarcastic
tone.

JAKOBY
Dude. Is it your man-period? Did you sleep?

WARD
No. Yes. Sort of. I keep seeing that asshole who blasted me.
 
9.


JAKOBY
You gotta try melatonin. I gotta bottle in my warbag I’ll flip you. Pop one an hour before bed and stay off the laptop. The screen fucks up your circadian rhythm.

WARD
Yeah, okay mom.

A beat of silence. What Ward really wants to talk about bubbles agonizingly to the surface.

WARD (CONT’D)
Nick, did you let that asshole go?

JAKOBY
Yeah I let him go. Because that’s what I do. Dude’s who shoot my partner get a pass.

WARD
It’s me and you brother.	Just me
and you talking.

JAKOBY
It’s fucked up you’d ask me that.

WARD
I saw his face, okay?	He was an
orc.	He was clan-blood.

JAKOBY
I don’t give a shit about clan-blood. I don’t. You’ve never came at me racial. Not once. You think I’d kick the dude who shot you loose because he’s green? Scott?

Ward sighs checks his texts.	Then...

WARD
I know you didn’t. But the guys on our Watch are talking mad shit. So it’s out there. Just know it’s out there.
(then)
If you came out on front street
about it I totally wouldn’t care.

Jakoby looks at Ward, with that intense open honesty he has.

JAKOBY
You would.	Scott, you would.
 
10.


EXT.	GRANDMA’S HOUSE - DAY

Ward hugs Sophia goodbye. SHERRI’S MOTHER looks on, while Jakoby waits with the car. Ward SEES Sophia’s crying.

WARD
Hey, Sophia, don’t cry, don’t cry.

SOPHIA
I don’t want you to die.

WARD
Honey.	I’m not going to die.	I
promise.	Go with Grandma.

SOPHIA
But mommy said Nick is going to get you killed.

Ward can barely contain his anger.

WARD
Mommy’s kidding.	She says silly
things sometime.

SOPHIA
I don’t want you to be dead.	I
hate you being a policeman.

Everybody hates policemen!

Sophia twists away. Runs crying towards the house. Ward absorbs the blow for a moment. When he returns to the car, Jakoby is gentle with this...

JAKOBY
Remind me, partner, why Sherri’s

not watching her tonight?

WARD
She’s got a date.

JAKOBY
Bro. Why are you still letting her live with you?

WARD
You know why.

JAKOBY
Sophia’s not your daughter.

WARD
Funny. Cause it sure fucking feels like she is, Nick.
 
11.


JAKOBY
I’m sorry. You know what I mean. I don’t know how to be on your side when you’re not on your side.

Ward angrily gets in the car...

WARD
Save me, Nick.	Save me from all
the ex-strippers of the world.


EXT.	LAPD STATION - DAY

Solidly in the hood. A black SUV pulls up. Two Federal Agents step out in black suits. One is human, he’s all about Gracie Ju-Jitsu and fine tailoring -- This is MONTEHUGH.

The taller Agent is lithe with striking dark skin and dazzling teal eyes. LIKE MOST ELVES his features are nearly human, if perhaps slightly stretched. Almost too perfect, barring of course, his pointed ears -- This is KANDOMERE.

MONTEHUGH
It’s, um, rustic here. I’m sure the inhabitants of this outpost have priceless knowledge to aid us on our quest.

Kandomere cocks an eyebrow at him.

KANDOMERE
I apologize there are no local shops with artisanal kale smoothies and organic chicken breast in ten pound servings. Stay on task.

Montehugh glares at Kandomere as they enter the station.

MONTEHUGH
My gains, bruh.	Never mock my
gains.


INT.	LAPD STATION - DAY

Crammed and with lead paint and peeling asbestos. Kandomere and Montehugh check in at the front desk.

CAMERA FINDS JAKOBY -- In a nearby hallway, watching the Agents from the shadows. Nervous.

Kandomere feels Jakoby’s gaze. Looks over. Jakoby is already gone.
 
12.


INT.	LAPD STATION - LOCKER ROOM - DAY

Cops suit up to protect and serve. Ward peels the dry cleaning bag off a fresh uniform.

WARD
Hey, any of you seen my partner?

HICKS, a middle aged bulldog of a man, laughs thickly.

HICKS
Big green dude? Orange eyes? Not exactly a Rhodes Scholar? Why yes. I have seen your partner.

BROWN, 20s, with fratboy excitability, jumps in...

BROWN
Hah.	You said partner with
airquotes.

HICKS
See, Ward’s partner is a peace

officer.

BROWN
Fucking outstanding.	Airquotes
again.

HICKS
(announces loudly)
Anyone have a location on our
diversity hire?	He likes to

wander.

Ward fumes. POLLARD, late 30s, with the bitter cold demeanor of a broken street cop, mutters this:

POLLARD
Cops don’t wander.	Pets wander.
Ward, you wanna ride with a dog,

work K9.

They laugh in that stupid, self congratulatory way racists always do. Ward about to explode...

POLLARD (CONT’D)
If I get smoked, gentlemen.	Let
the asshole go.

BROWN
Dude.	I so got you.	Done.
 
13.


WARD
And now I say fuck you to you.

You.	And you.

HICKS
You know what they say about clan
blood.
(ominously)

Once for the Dark Lord, always for the Dark Lord.

WARD
How can dumb-asses like you who can’t remember your wife's birthday still have beef against a whole race of people for some shit that went down thousands of years ago?

HICKS
Race of people.

BROWN
Bam!	Airquotes!	You are the
fucking master.

Ward spins to about to break Brown’s neck...

BANG-BANG-BANG! SERGEANT CHING, a badass intelligent female, is pounding on a locker...

SERGEANT CHING
Hi guys. If we’re done handing Ward ammo for his inevitable lawsuit against the Department, it’s time to drink in the Captain’s wisdom.


INT.	LAPD STATION - ROLL CALL ROOM - DAY

The Cops we met sit at tables. Jakoby and Ward noticeably isolated from the “cool kids”. Jakoby whispers to Ward:

JAKOBY
I saw feds in the building.	They
had an elf and everything.	Think
they’re here for me?

WARD
You’d be suspended already if
something was up.	Lay off the

energy drinks.
 
14.


JAKOBY
Right, man, yeah.

CAPTAIN PEREZ enters...

CAPTAIN PEREZ
I’d like to welcome everyone to the latest episode of “We Are All Fucked” starring the PM Watch.

Mock cheers and real laughs from the boys and girls.

CAPTAIN PEREZ (CONT’D) Tonight we got the trifecta. Full moon on a Friday night in a Summer heatwave. The streets will be seriously assholed-up and we’re spread thin as Royce’s comb-over.

One of the officers, ROYCE, chuckles.

CAPTAIN PEREZ (CONT’D)
That means clear your calls fast
and help your colleagues clear
theirs.	Get me outta this
reporting period without another

murder, I’ll buy you all coffee.

This gets a positive, serious response. As he rushes off to the next thing...

CAPTAIN PEREZ (CONT’D)
Sergeant Ching, all yours.

SERGEANT CHING
Yessir!

A former Marine, she snaps to with her clipboard...

SERGEANT CHING (CONT’D) After I call your name, get your shotguns and radios and deploy. I don’t want to see you here unless there’s badguys under the desks. Pollard. Brown. You’re working Three-A-Four.

POLLARD
Shotguns and radios?	When do we
get the graham crackers and apple

juice?
 
15.


SERGEANT CHING
I will fuck you up, Pollard. I give zero fucks how much time in grade you got. Zero fucks. Ward, Jakoby. Three-A-Nine. Gomez and the rookie with the unpronounceable Thai surname. Three-A-Six.

Jakoby and Ward can’t get out of there fast enough...


EXT./INT.	SOUTH LA/COP CAR (MOVING) - DAY

Ward grinds his teeth as Jakoby drives. Jakoby cranks his bluetooth speakers to fill the silence.

WARD
Bro.	No.	We’re not listening to
Orkish folk music.

JAKOBY
You gonna act like a little bitch all watch? I thought Orcs were supposed to be dark motherfuckers. You need to get laid. Get a Sancha like every other cop working South Central. You got all the hoodrats chasing you.

WARD
I don’t need to get laid.

JAKOBY
Yes you do. Humans are easy to read. Like you guys have all these little tells.

WARD
Little tells like what?

JAKOBY
Like when you make this face...

Jakoby makes a bizarre face. Ward can’t help it, starts chuckling.

WARD
What face is that?	That’s not a
face.

JAKOBY
It’s the face you’re making right
now.	It’s a human who needs some

pussy face.
 
16.


WARD
Sure.	I see it now.	Show me
another human face.

Jakoby makes a bizarre pouting expression.

JAKOBY
This is when a human finds out he

isn’t getting any pancakes.

WARD
(laughing now)

It’s true, we do love pancakes.

Ward changes the music -- A BANGING TRACK starts. The boys laugh, rolling through the hood. Its modest homes and palm trees splashed with golden late afternoon sunlight...


EXT./INT.	SOUTH LA/COP CAR (MOVING) - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY

WE SEE brief, beautiful images of the view from their car.

MUCH IS FAMILIAR -- KIDS playing football in the street. HOMELESS PEOPLE in tent cities. HISPANIC FAMILIES buying from push carts. HOOKERS selling their souls.

SOME LESS SO -- A tough looking group of ORCS glares AT CAMERA from the porch. An OGRE loads an Engine Block into a pick-up. A LIZARD MAN sorts bottles and cans. A dwarf woman hurries along with her groceries, walking a small dog.

South Central’s as South Central always was, and is as South Central’s never been...

DISPATCH (V.O.)
Three-Adam-Nine.	Four fifteen man.
Alameda and Jefferson.	Code two.
Incident two eight zero six two.

WARD
Three-Adam-Nine.	Roger, show us
enroute.

Jakoby busts a U as Ward checks the computer for deets on the call.


EXT.	SOUTH LA - INTERSECTION - DAY

A bearded HOMELESS MAN, shirtless, dirty and emaciated, wildly swings a broadsword in the middle of the intersection. Screaming his head off...
 
17.


HOMELESS MAN
A great cloud is coming, a great black cloud of fire! The Dark Lord grows closer every day! We may have forgotten about magic, but magic has not forgotten about us!

Jakoby and Ward's cruiser glides to a stop alongside an LA Sheriff’s car. Alone behind the wheel is RODRIGUEZ. A good dude and a good cop, he gives Jakoby and Ward a “wassup” head tilt. The three nonplussed cops watch the show...

HOMELESS MAN (CONT’D)
The Dark Lord’s eyes are opening!

They are opening!

WARD
Suspect’s nine feet tall, burning red eyes, black armor, flaming ax, got it.

RODRIGUEZ
It’s the full moon, dude.

WARD
Yep.	What’s your plan Rodriguez?

RODRIGUEZ
My plan? Nothing. He’s on your side of the street. But he crosses that yellow line, I’m dumping him with the crowd pleaser.

Rodriguez grabs his shotgun. Jakoby sighs. Grabs the microphone. Flips the console to PA mode...

JAKOBY
(booming over the PA)
Sir.	Sir.	Drop the sword.	Drop.

The.	Sword.

HOMELESS MAN
YOU!

The homeless man points his sword directly at Jakoby...

HOMELESS MAN (CONT’D) Two thousand years ago we fought him with swords and arrows! Now he rises again. We will fight him with bullets and bombs!

JAKOBY
Why’re Orcs always the bad guys?
 
18.


RODRIGUEZ
Don’t look at me, man.	Mexicans
still get shit for the Alamo.

Ward's had enough -- Pops out with his Glock...

WARD
Yo. Unless you wanna die, drop the sword. Right. Fucking. Now.

Wow.	Ward can be a real asshole.	The Man tosses the sword.
Drops to his knees.	Shows his hands -- He knows the drill...

JAKOBY
I got him, partner.

Jakoby snaps on his gloves.	Approaches.	Cuffs the Man.
Walking him back to the cars.	Rodriguez about to bail...

RODRIGUEZ
Real quick, eh. Gang Intel guys are sayin’ Fogteeth activity’s off the chain. And Altamira’s gangbanging like it’s 1999. Watch your backs tonight.

He takes off as Jakoby stuffs the Man in back. The second he’s in the car he VOMITS...


EXT./INT.	SOUTH LA/COP CAR (MOVING) - DAY

Jakoby and Ward endure the puke smell as the Man rants.

HOMELESS MAN
The army of 9 races fought shoulder to shoulder to give you the world you take for granted now! Remember the old ways before the darkness returns! The clock ticks! The minute hand moves towards midnight!

WARD
Can you just chill for a sec?

The Man bores into Ward's eyes with his.	Low and quiet:

HOMELESS MAN
The Blood Moon is nigh and your test begins. Remember, the only truth is in your heart. Pass the test and thirty three seconds will be your reward.
 
19.


Ward looks at him entranced. Snaps out of it. Looks at Jakoby -- Who’s feeling the creepiness too...


INT.	LAPD STATION - PARKING GARAGE - DAY

Ward hoses the vomit out of the back. Captain Perez and two scary Internal Affairs Detectives -- ARKASHIAN and YAMAHARA approach. All duly grim...

CAPTAIN PEREZ
Where’s Jakoby?

WARD
Booking our body, sir.

The IA Detectives get in Ward's space. Eye him head to toe. Pure intimidation. Perez looks around. Leans on the car. He can be pretty scary himself. Quietly:

CAPTAIN PEREZ
The Department’s always been cutting edge. First radio cars. Helicopters. SWAT team. First to hire Orcs. We’re committed to diversity. As is Sacramento and Washington. But the politicians haven’t worked the ghetto. They’re not boots on the ground like we are.

WARD
Where’s this going, sir?

CAPTAIN PEREZ
The Orc who shot you is on the

street because of Jakoby.

WARD
Respectfully I disagree.	Jakoby
did no wrong.

ARKASHIAN
Do Orcs have mad hops?	How many
Orcs are ballers?

WARD
Excuse me?

YAMAHARA
You fucking heard the Detective.

How many Orcs play pro basketball?
 
20.


ARKASHIAN
None.	They’re slow.	They’re
heavy.	That’s why half the NFL
linebackers are Orcish.	It’s
simple physics.

WARD
I’m sorry.	Who are you?

ARKASHIAN
Fuck you.	That’s who we are.

YAMAHARA
Okay, let’s review kids.


EXT.	LIQUOR STORE - WARD’S FLASHBACK - DAY

Resuming the backstory here -- Ward, flat on his back, stares into the angry orange eyes of the Orc Gangbanger -- CLICK! The Orc tosses the jammed shotgun and runs into a crowded SWAP MEET. Jakoby takes off after him...

YAMAHARA (V.O.)
You respond to a silent ringer and some Orc lays you out with buckshot. Jakoby foot pursues and corners shithead in a dead end alley. Then it gets mysterious.

IN THE DEAD END ALLEY -- The Gangbanger charges. Knocks Jakoby down. His Glock SKITTERS across piss-soaked asphalt...

ARKASHIAN (V.O.)
Jakoby stated dude tackles him.
Disarms him.	Jumps up, grabs a

fire escape ladder.	Evades arrest.

ON THE FIRE ESCAPE -- Gangbanger kicks in a window, dives in.


INT.	LAPD STATION - PARKING GARAGE - DAY

Arkashian and Yamahara glaring at Ward...

ARKASHIAN
Jakoby’s on record saying this.

Signed, sealed, witnessed.

YAMAHARA
Ladder’s thirteen feet off the ground. Thirteen. We measured it. No Orc has a six foot vertical.
 
21.


WARD
Suspect was light on his feet, sir.

ARKASHIAN
Your boy kicked loose the green fuck who blasted you. Do the math.

Ward doing the math...

CAPTAIN PEREZ
Jakoby was a social experiment
mandated by outsiders.	Clan Blood
isn’t compatible with law
enforcement.	Problem is we can’t

fire him without cause.

YAMAHARA
You’re going to tie the noose that hangs him. Get him to admit it. Record him on this.

Yamahara proffers a small digital recorder...

WARD
This guy’s my brother.	He’s the
best street cop I’ve worked with.

I can’t fuck him like that.

CAPTAIN PEREZ
Then you’re fired.	I want your
badge, gun and ID.

Ward REACTS...

ARKASHIAN
You got a house in the hood you can’t sell. Student loans up the ass. Shacked up with a stripper and her kid. Have fun looking for work as a disgraced ex-cop.

Ward stares at the recorder. At his antagonists. If looks could kill they’d all be dead...


EXT./INT.	SOUTH LA/COP CAR (MOVING) - DAY

Ward driving.	Tense.	He’s palming the recorder.

WARD
Hey partner?

JAKOBY
What’s up buddy?
 
22.


Jakoby looks up from the logbook -- With that open, honest energy he has. Ward is pole axed. He can’t betray him. Surreptitiously tosses the recorder out his window.

WARD
Where you wanna eat, partner?

DISPATCH (V.O.)
Three-Adam-Nine.	Unknown
disturbance.	341 Abrams Street.
Code two.	Incident two eight one
one five.

JAKOBY
Three-Adam-Nine.	Show us enroute.
KMA.


EXT./INT.	SOUTH LA - DEAD END STREET/COP CAR (MOVING) - DAY

Isolated. High walls everywhere. Barbed wire. Black iron spikes. This is Altamira Locos country. Their graffiti everywhere. Ward and Jakoby cruise slowly. Jakoby clocks a LITTLE HOMIE watching them from a porch...

JAKOBY
Spotter.	There.

WARD
Hiii buddy.	How old do you think
he is, fifteen?

JAKOBY
If that.	This is it on the right.


EXT.	SOUTH LA - 341 ABRAMS - DAY

They pull up to the house. It’s a 2 storey death trap. The overgrown yard filled with junk cars garbage. Scary as fuck.

WARD
They should fire their landscaper.

JAKOBY
(into mic)
Three-Adam-Nine.	Show me Code Six

at Three Four One Abrams.

Jakoby staring at the house, spooked...

WARD
What’s up?	What do you see?
 
23.


JAKOBY
Nothin.

They exit the car -- The Little Homie has drifted over to watch them...

JAKOBY (CONT’D)
Why’s always kids doing the dirty

work out here?

WARD
Altamira jumps ‘em in at twelve.
They don’t have Hair One but

they’re down for life.

Crossing to the house...

JAKOBY
Sucks.	Even Orc clans wait till
you’re fifteen before you get

blooded.

WARD
Different strokes.

JAKOBY
I don’t see it, man.	Must be a
California thing.

WARD
(laughing)
That’s so you.	That’s your

catchphrase.

JAKOBY
I don’t have a catchphrase.

WARD
Anything you don’t agree with, it’s always like “must be a California thing.”

JAKOBY
Partner!

KABOOM! -- SHOTGUN FIRE ERUPTS FROM AN UPSTAIRS WINDOW!

WARD
Fuck me!	Holy shit!

They scramble back to their car -- Wards sliding over the hood, Jakoby over the trunk. KABOOM! KABOOM! Shotgun fire shredding their black and white!
 
24.


WARD (CONT’D)
(into radio)
Three-Adam-Nine.	Shots fired.
Officer needs help.	Three Forty

One Abrams.

JAKOBY
What the fuck, man?	This is bad,
this is so bad.

WARD
Easy partner.	Stay in cover.

KABOOM! -- The windows above them explode, spraying them with glass! Ward calculates the next move...

JAKOBY
Holy fuck!	Holy shit!

WARD
Okay. Be cool. On three we’re dumping on this asshole. Just empty your mag. I’ll do the rest. One. Two...

KABOOM! -- The hood is shredded. KABOOM! -- The light bar explodes...

WARD (CONT’D)
Three!

They pop up and return fire on the darkened window...

BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM! -- Jakoby sprays. Ward takes careful aimed shots -- They drop back into cover. Breathing hard.

WARD (CONT’D)
You okay?

JAKOBY
No holes.	I’m good.	You okay?

Ward's fine.	They trade nods.	Pop up again and SEE...

An arm hangs from the window.	Blood drips off fingertips.
They got him.	Now they hear a CHILD CRYING inside the house.

JAKOBY (CONT’D)
There’s a kid in there.

Ward doesn’t hesitate.	Breaks cover, running...
 
25.


JAKOBY (CONT’D)
Wait for the cavalry.	Scott?
Fine.	Fuck it.

Jakoby runs to join him...


INT.	341 ABRAMS - DAY

WHAM! -- The front door is kicked open -- Ward and Jakoby charge in.

WARD
Police Officers!	Stay where you
are, we’ll find you!

No reponse.	Ward and Jakoby ease further in.

JAKOBY
I smell blood.

They ease forward. Tactical. Careful. Through a gloomy darkness of ratty furniture and exposed walls...

JAKOBY (CONT’D)
Body.

Legs poke from a door frame leading into the kitchen. The partners advance and REACT...

WARD
Wh...oh shit. What is that? What is that bro?

The entire top half of the dead man has been BLASTED INTO ASH, he’s a blackened, charred, skeleton from the waist up. A massive scorch mark on the wall...

Ward stares, blinking, trying to snap himself out of shock.
Jakoby isn’t doing as well.

JAKOBY
Look.	Shit dude, look.

Ward turns, SEES a hole blown in the wall, into the back yard. Like a bomb went off...

An ORC dead in the yard, half of him turned to stone, his other half gruesomely dead, a pistol next to him. Another dead man, blown in half, is in the kitchen. The two cops stare in awe.

JAKOBY (CONT’D)
Wh- what the fuck happened here?
 
26.


WARD
(into radio)
Three-Adam-Nine.	Possible Bright

on scene.

Nothing back from the radio...

WARD (CONT’D)
Three-Adam-Nine.	Three Four One
Abrams.	Possible Magic User at our
location.	Request additional units
for a perimeter and a supervisor.

His radio replies with an eerie HISS. The hair stands up on the back of their necks...

JAKOBY
Where’s the troops?	Where is
everyone.

Then ... a noise. Both men startle. Then push further into the dark house...

WARD
Door.

JAKOBY
Got it.

Jakoby gently pushes the cracked door, it drifts open...


INT.	341 ABRAMS - SHOOTER’S ROOM - DAY

The SHOOTER is slumped against the window, breathing shallow, shotgun on the floor. Bloody. His eyes follow the cops...

WARD
Do not move.	Do not move.

Ward advances, kicks the gun away, eyes his wounds.

JAKOBY
Is he staying or going dude?

WARD
Hey can you hear me? Can you hear me, man, can you..?

The Shooter mutters something with his dying breath...

SHOOTER
T’rein...Oter...T’lias o’ter...
 
27.


WARD
What’s he saying?	That Elvish?

JAKOBY
Yeah, it’s Old Elvish.

Suddenly a FIGURE bursts out of hiding, scrambles out the door!

WARD
Shit.	Grab em.	Grab em.

Jakoby takes off...


EXT.	SOUTH LA - 341 ABRAMS - DAY

The figure bursts out the front door at a full run with Jakoby in hot pursuit -- Jakoby dives and tackles the figure, knocking it to the ground...

WE SEE it’s a young ELF GIRL, screaming, frantic. Fighting like a banshee. Clutching something to her chest -- She snaps at Jakoby...

JAKOBY
Fuck, she’s trying to bite me! Get her hands she’s got something!

Ward rushes out to help restrain the kid. She’s clearly trying to keep something away from them.

WARD
What’s she got?	What’s she
holding!?

Ward and Jakoby pin her down -- AN ARC OF PURPLE ELECTRICITY BLASTS UP AND STRIKES THE POWER LINES -- IGNITING THEM!

Jakoby and Ward jump back, drawing their guns. The little girl cowers, drops what she’s holding...

WARD (CONT’D)
Shit! ... Shit!

Both cops stare in shock -- At the reedy white piece of wood, with a black handle and gold detailing...

JAKOBY
Is that...that’s not...is that a...
 

Yes...it’s a WAND!
 
28.


CAMERA FINDS the LITTLE HOMIE. Now across the street, he saw everything. He turns and runs up the block at full speed...

INT.	341 ABRAMS - KITCHEN - DAY

Pollard, the dick cop from earlier, Hicks and Ward all stare at the wand on the kitchen table. Sergeant Ching enters...

SERGEANT CHING
There’s a blood trail leaving the
property.	Smells weird like

gasoline.

WARD
Gasoline? Jesus Christ, what bleeds gasoline, what’s that mean?

POLLARD
The blood trail belongs to our
bright.	Whatever went down, he
gets shot and bailed out back

without his wand.

WARD
Why aren’t we evacuating the neighborhood? Remember how all those people died when the kids in Philly found a wand?

SERGEANT CHING
That was before Twitter. We don’t want to start a panic. You said the elf kid used the wand?

WARD
The kid’s not a bright.	The wand
just went off or something.

SERGEANT CHING
What’s the kid saying?

WARD
The kid isn’t saying shit, she’s
freaked out.	Plus she doesn’t

speak English, only Elvish.

HICKS
Ever seen a wand in person?

WARD
What? Sure ... yeah. That broken one in the Smithsonian.
 
29.


POLLARD
So what are we gonna do about this?

WARD
Secure the scene until the feds
show up.	This is way above our

paygrades.

HICKS
I didn’t call the feds.	Pollard,
you call the feds?

POLLARD
Nope.

Pollard, Sgt. Ching and Hicks exchange looks. Ward beginning to clock something’s wrong.

WARD
What are we talking about here,

guys.	C’mon.	Sarge?

Sgt. Ching just stares with her cold black eyes.

POLLARD
Wands royally fuck up radio reception. Dispatch never heard you. We did ‘cause we were close by. But the Department knows fuck all about the wand. If they did the whole world would be here. The wand doesn’t exist. The wand was never here.
(finally...)

We’re taking the wand.

WARD
What the fuck are you even saying?

You don’t know how to use a wand.

POLLARD
Don’t worry.	I know people who
know people.

WARD
Come the fuck on, this isn’t

happening, this is a joke.

Then...

POLLARD
That’s magic.	On the table.
That’s whatever you want.	Want a
million bucks?	Ten million?

(MORE)
 
30.

POLLARD (CONT'D)
You got it. Wanna be taller? Shorter? You want a bigger dick? You want fame? Power? Eternal health? That wand is anything you want. Follow your heart, Ward.

A beat as Ward looks in his heart...

WARD
You’re not stealing a wand.

HICKS
No one’s coming Ward.

SERGEANT CHING
Hicks back off.	Scott, you need
this just as much we do.	Maybe
more. People depend on you. People care about you. You want to be there for them, right?

Fuck she’s scary.

HICKS
...what about Jakoby..?

Boom.	There it is...


EXT.	SOUTH LA - 341 ABRAMS - DAY

Two more cop cars outside. The little elf girl sits on Pollard’s hood, her purple eyes stare through long white blond hair hanging down over pale skin. Wrapped in a blanket, Jakoby comforts her in halting, imperfect Elvish.

JAKOBY
(subtitled)
I will keep you safe.	On my honor.

Can you tell me your name?

The little girl speaks quietly, through tears.

TIKKA
(subtitled)

Tikka. My name is Tikka. We have to leave before they come back.

JAKOBY
(subtitled)

Before who comes back?
 

Tikka’s eyes say it all -- Someone utterly terrifying...
 
31.


INT.	SOUTH LA - 341 ABRAMS - DAY

Ward is sweating now. Pacing. The three corrupt cops are anxious, impatient...

WARD
This isn’t happening, this isn’t fucking happening, this is a dream, man. This is a bad dream.

SERGEANT CHING
Pollard, he’s spinning.

POLLARD
He’s fine.	Let him catch up to it.

WARD
I’m not catchin’ up to shit. You don’t know magic! People will die!

Ward shoves Pollard.	Sgt. Ching gets in between them...

SERGEANT CHING
Whoa.	Easy.	Bring it down.

POLLARD
Fuck this. Ward, lemme reframe this. Want your little girl to not have a father AND Jakoby dies? Or just Jakoby dies? Because you’re in fuckin fantasy land if you think you’re walking outta here with life as you know it intact.

WARD
You threatening me motherfucker?

HICKS
I think he just caught up to it.

POLLARD
Who means more to you? Your little girl or your pet monster? We’re leaving with the wand. You wanna go home tonight? The orc dies either way. End of story.

There’s a brutal silence.	We hear the flies buzzing.	The
whine of the old light bulbs.	Hicks is smooth as Satan...
