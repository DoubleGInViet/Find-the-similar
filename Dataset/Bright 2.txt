HICKS
Use your gun. The kid got your gun away from you. And shot Jakoby with it. Right out front there.
 
32.


WARD
How’s a little elf girl gonna

disarm me?

HICKS
The kid was the bright.	The kid
got away.	The kid disappeared.

WARD
No ... come on...

POLLARD
We got people coming to help.
People who know how to fix things.

This will work out good for you.

Pollard puts a brotherly arm around Ward...

POLLARD (CONT’D)
You’re not making the decision,
okay?	The situation is making the
decision for you.	It’s not your
fault.	It’s just how things worked

out.

SGT. CHING
Enough bullshit.	You or him.

WARD
Fuck!	Shit!

Ward takes a deep breath. We see him slowly realize there’s no way out...

HICKS
Perfect storm, bro. It’s a perfect storm.


EXT.	SOUTH LA - 341 ABRAMS - DAY

Ward bursts out door, walking with purpose towards Jakoby.

JAKOBY
Hey man, where the fuck is everyone? We don’t have a perimeter. I think that pee-wee gangster saw the wand. And the Elf kid’s hell’a spooked. Saying someone’s coming back and shit.

Jakoby notices Ward can’t face him...
 
33.


JAKOBY (CONT’D)
What’s wrong?

WARD
You let that kid go because he was clan blood. Admit it.

JAKOBY
What the fuck are you doing right

now?	What is this?

WARD
Tell me now!

Ward shoves Jakoby, who snarls.

JAKOBY
Don’t put your hands on me.

ON THE HOUSE -- Sgt. Ching, Hicks, Pollard drift outside.
Watching from a distance.	Hicks holds the wand...

WARD
You fucked me!	You fucked us both!
You stupid piece of green shit!

Ward shoves him again. Jakoby growls at him, menacing like a Doberman, frightening and animalistic. Ward gets in his face, pressing foreheads...

WARD (CONT’D)
You fucked my fucking life for some thugged out punk ass Orc fuck.

JAKOBY
Fuck you.	Fuck off.

Jakoby snarls. Now clearly dangerous. He doesn’t notice Ward flip the release on his holster...

WARD
You fucked yourself more. Shit comes back, motherfucker. Ready you fucking pigface piece of shit? Here it comes...

JAKOBY
(snapping)

Okay! I let him go! Is that what you fucking wanted to hear?
 
34.


WARD
I knew it, I fucking KNEW it you
lying sack of shit.	Blood’s

thicker than water, right?

JAKOBY
I don’t give a shit about clan-blood! I’m not blooded! My father’s not blooded. His father’s not blooded. We’re not all caught up in that ignorant antiquated shit. My whole life I’ve caught shit from Orcs for it. Look dumbass. I have my teeth filed!
(then, deflated)
It’s not blood.	It was the wrong

kid.

WARD
(faltering)

Wha...What?


EXT.	SOUTH LA - SWAP MEET - JAKOBY’S FLASHBACK - DAY

BLACK HOODIE runs through the stalls.	Jakoby chases him.
People wiping past as he runs.	Jakoby exits the back.
Realizes he lost the suspect -- Then SEES him in the alley...

JAKOBY (V.O.)
He ran through the swap meet. Into the crowd. Then I saw him again.


EXT.	SOUTH LA - DEAD END ALLEY - JAKOBY’S FLASHBACK - DAY

Jakoby running.	Stops pulls his gun.	Black Hoodie stops.
His back to us.	Cornered...

JAKOBY (V.O.)
I had the motherfucker dead to

rights.	But it wasn’t him.

Black Hoodie turns.	This is a younger Orc.	SIRENS approach.

JAKOBY (V.O.)
The troops were coming. Responding to an assault on a peace officer. And here’s a kid matching the description. He’s fucked. A bunch of jacked up humans with guns. And an Orc kid? We know how it ends. So I did the right thing.
 
35.


CLOSE ON BLACK HOODIE’S HAND as it grasps the fire escape ladder. WIDER TO REVEAL Jakoby helping him up...

A beat later two black and whites scream into the alley.
Pollard, Hicks, Brown and Ching pop out with guns...


EXT.	SOUTH LA - 341 ABRAMS - DAY

Ward reeling...

WARD
How do you know it was the wrong

guy?	You see his face?

JAKOBY
No. Smell. Evolution never took our sense of smell away. He smelled different. What jury would believe that?

WARD
So why the fuck was he running?

JAKOBY
History. Cops and Orcs? I’d run too. I’m sorry the Orc who shot you’s in the wind. I lost him in the swap meet. I didn’t help him escape. I helped some kid climb a ladder to avoid a lifetime of hell. The worst part’s been lying to you.

Jakoby shakes his head, trying to calm himself down.

JAKOBY (CONT’D)
And you know what, fuck you for

making me tell you.

Ward staring at Jakoby. A weirdly dead look of calm passes over Ward’s face. The situation is making the decision...

WARD
(quietly)

I need you to stay calm, okay?

JAKOBY
What?

Pollard steps forward.

POLLARD
Time’s up, Ward.	Do it.
 
36.


JAKOBY
Do what--?

This happens so fast you can’t catch your breath -- Ward draws his gun, spins:

BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM! Fires textbook LAPD ‘accelerated pairs’ into center mass -- Tikka recoils screaming --

Pollard, Hicks and Ching falling!	HOLY SHIT!

JAKOBY (CONT’D)
Wha...what the fuck?

Jakoby blinks, looks at Ward thinking -- “I can’t believe you did that you idiot.” Jakoby quickdraws. Aims at Ward...

JAKOBY (CONT’D)
Drop it. Drop it now. I will kill you. I will fucking kill you.

Ward tosses his gun, slowly drops to his knees...

JAKOBY (CONT’D)
What the fuck?	What the fuck?

WARD
Listen to me, Nick, I need you to-

JAKOBY
Shut up and show me your hands!

Ward does, Jakoby shoves him down, knee in his back. Cuffs him. All business...

WARD
Nick?

JAKOBY
Shut up!

WARD
Stop telling me to shut up, just

fucking listen to me!

JAKOBY
SHUT UP!

Jakoby hauls Ward to his feet, stuffs him in the cruiser.
SLAMS the door.

WARD
Jakoby!	I can explain!

Jakoby grabs Tikka.	Puts her in the passenger seat...
 
37.


JAKOBY
(subtitled)

Stay here, don’t move.

WARD
Nick!	Hear me out!

Jakoby crosses to the bodies -- Tikka turns to Ward. And smiles -- Grateful. It means the World to Ward...

ON JAKOBY -- SEES Ching and Hicks are motionless. Pollard crawling towards the house, leaving a wide swath of blood. Jakoby turns him over -- Pollard looks at Jakoby in terror. Tries to pulls his gun, but his hand slick with blood.

JAKOBY
Hey Pollard, shit man, I’m getting you medical. Gimme your hand. Keep pressure on this, don’t let go. I got you, brother.

Jakoby helps him staunch the wound. Next Jakoby checks Ching and Hicks. Both are dead.

JAKOBY (CONT’D)
(into radio)
Three-Adam-Nine.	Officer down.
Conscious and breathing.	Two more
officer’s down.	Not conscious not
breathing.	One in custody.	Send
me additional units.	Get me an RA
and a supervisor.

No reply from dispatch -- Just eerie distortion...

Now Jakoby notices the wand -- He grabs it. Returns to the car. Tosses it on the dash...

WARD
Nick!	Heads up!	We got looky-
loos!

Jakoby turns and REACTS -- Seven yoked and tatted VETERANOS from Altamira approach in a phalanx. Backlit by the setting sun. The menace palpable...

Jakoby stares a beat -- “I don’t need this shit.” Then grabs the shotgun and racks it -- KERCHACK!

JAKOBY
Sir.	Stay back.

POISON, the shotcaller, smiles, shows his hands. Ever so friendly. Ever so cunning. Easing forward...
 
38.


POISON
You need some help officer?

JAKOBY
Sir.	This is an active crime
scene.	Cross the street.

POISON
So why are all the cops blasting on each other?

JAKOBY
Get the fuck back.

POISON
And sabes que, homie? Word on the street’s there’s a wand in the hood.

Jakoby REACTS.	The Veteranos slowly encircling him...

WARD
Nick, unless you’re down to smoke these dude and twenty more we have to un-ass this place right now.

JAKOBY
(whispering)

Shut up, just shut up.

POISON
When the little homie told me, I’m like ‘hell no’. A wand? In this motherfucker? Naw. Then I hear all these cops are blasting each other. Now that’s worthy of exploration.

Jakoby, noting how close they are, gets behind the driver’s door...

JAKOBY
(subtitled)
Tikka, we’re gonna be fine, stay

calm.

Jakoby is now surrounded. SEES hands in pockets, hidden behind backs. These fuckers are armed. Now Poison SEES the wand on the dash...

POISON
That’s it, huh?	That shit don’t
belong to the Government.

(MORE)
 
39.

POISON (CONT'D)
It belongs to the Community.	To
the people.	We’ll take it now.

Jakoby aims the shotgun at Poison...

JAKOBY
Anyone makes a move, I’m shooting

you in the face.	You.	Not them.

Poison just smiles.	Jakoby slowly sits in the driver’s seat.
Still aiming at Poison.	Jakoby keys his radio:

JAKOBY (CONT’D)
(into mic)
Three-Adam-Nine.	I’m Code Six
George at Three Four One Abrams.

Get me back-up and an airship.

Just more creepy HISSING in response...

WARD
It’s the wand.	Radios don’t work.

JAKOBY
Shut up, man.	I got this.

WARD
We have to go!	Jakoby!

JAKOBY
I’m not leaving Pollard!

WARD
Pollard wanted me to kill you!

He’s not the victim here!

WHAM! -- The windshield is hit with a CROWBAR! Veteranos jump on the hood and trunk. Attacking from all sides...

WARD (CONT’D)
They’re gonna kill us!	Go!	Go!

Jakoby starts the car and stomps the gas. Throws it in reverse. Sending Veteranos tumbling. He does an E-brake turn. Then guns it up the street, siren blaring...


EXT./INT.	SOUTH LA/COP CAR (MOVING) - DAY

Jakoby barrels up the street.	Tikka screaming in fear.
Jakoby breathing hard.	It feels so good to get away...
 
40.


WARD
Slow down.	Dude.	Slow the fuck
down!

The wand starts to GLOW...

WARD (CONT’D)
Nick!	Snap out of it!	Slow d...

The wand floats into the air, vibrating with energy...

KA-WHAM! -- The car plows into ... nothing. The front end crushes in like it just hit an invisible brick wall!

Then silence. The wand stops glowing. The smashed vehicle steams, bleeding oil and water in the middle of the street.

Night has begun to fall over South LA...


INT.	LAPD STATION - OFFICE - NIGHT

Kandomere, the Elf Fed we met earlier, flips through boxes of arrest forms. His photographic memory drinking in the info fast as he turns the page. Montehugh, his human partner, enters in a rush...

MONTEHUGH
Something’s going down.

Kandomere looks up and cocks an eyebrow: “Go on.”

MONTEHUGH (CONT’D) Tech services flagged some weird ass cellphone intercepts. Bunch’a cops talking about a bright-

KANDOMERE
I’ve heard nothing on the scanner.

MONTEHUGH
-and talking about a wand.

KANDOMERE
Where?

He has Kandomere’s full attention...

MONTEHUGH
Guess.
 

They can’t get out of there fast enough...
 
41.


EXT.	SOUTH LA - 341 ABRAMS - NIGHT

The sky is hesitant to release the day, its final soft blue glow recedes from the darkness. It’s unnaturally quiet on this evil isolated little street...

HIDDEN ON THE PORCH -- Pollard, in agony, trying to dial his iPhone. It’s maddening to work a touch screen through so much blood. He hears an SUV pull up. FOOTSTEPS approach. He sets down his cell. Grabs his gun...

GIBSON crosses to the house. Stops to pick up WARD’S GUN. She could be 20 or 40. Her age and gender are a mystery. But she’s clearly an apex predator. Everything she does is weighted with thought, meaning and intent, down to the smallest movement.

She steps over the bodies of Sergeant Ching and Hicks. Behind her are SLASHER and COWBOY, with carbines and body armor. They have that Special Forces vibe, a couple hundred confirmed kills between them.

Gibson stepping, Pollard slumps with relief...

POLLARD
Gibson?	Thank fuck.

She turns to her muscle...

GIBSON
Get him inside.


INT.	341 ABRAMS - KITCHEN - NIGHT

Pollard sits at the kitchen table. Slasher and Cowboy regard the hole blown in the wall. Pollard groans in pain. Gibson studies him silently for a time. Then sits across from him.

GIBSON
You going to be all right?

POLLARD
What?	Fuck no, I’m ... help me.

GIBSON
Of course.	Help is coming.
(beat)

Where’s the wand?

POLLARD
They took it ... they took it ...

fuckers shot me!
 
42.


GIBSON
Describe it.

POLLARD
What?

GIBSON
The wand.	Describe it.

POLLARD
S’white ... gold ... black handle.

GIBSON
“They” who took it are...
(reading off her phone)

Scott Ward and Jakoby the Orc? Is that correct?

POLLARD
That’s...that’s right...Local

gangsters chased them off.

GIBSON
Humans?

POLLARD
Yeah.	Hispanic gang.

GIBSON
Do they know about the wand?

Pollard just groans.	Gibson turns to Slasher and Cowboy.

GIBSON (CONT’D)
Priority one is to secure that
wand.	It might be with the gang.

It might be with the cops.

Gibson thinking as Pollard bleeds on the floor.	Drip.	Drip.
Drip...

GIBSON (CONT’D)
Are there GPS units in your patrol vehicles?

POLLARD
Yes.

GIBSON
We’ll find him that way.
(to Cowboy and Slasher)

Get on the bodies.
 
43.


Cowboy and Slasher quickly exit. She shows Ward’s Glock to Pollard...

GIBSON (CONT’D)
Is this the weapon Ward used?

POLLARD
Yeah.

BAM! -- Gibson shoots Pollard in the head.


EXT.	SOUTH LA - 341 ABRAMS - NIGHT

Slasher rolls Ching’s body in a carpet. Another rolled up carpet presumably contains Hicks. Cowboy uses a metal detector to locate shell casings from Ward's gun...

Gibson exits. Looking around. Scanning for prey. Feels someone watching her. Spins to SEE SOMEONE duck behind the curtains of the little house across the street...


EXT.	SOUTH LA - OLD MAN’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Gibson KNOCKS -- Holds an LAPD badge to the window.

GIBSON
Police!	LAPD!

The door opens.	Still chained.	An OLD MAN peers at her...

GIBSON (SPANISH) (CONT’D) I need to ask you some questions. You can talk to me here, or talk to me downtown.

The door closes.	The chain is removed.	It opens again.


INT.	OLD MAN’S HOUSE - 5 MINUTES LATER - NIGHT

The OLD MAN and OLD WOMAN clearly want no part of this. But are cooperating. Gibson takes notes...

GIBSON (SPANISH)
The police were shooting at each

other?

OLD MAN (SPANISH)
We’ve lived here for thirty years, and never seen that.
 
44.


GIBSON (SPANISH)
Who shot the other police?	The
Orc?

OLD MAN (SPANISH)
No the white man. The Orc took him away in handcuffs.

GIBSON (SPANISH)
The Orc handcuffed him?

OLD WOMAN (SPANISH) Yes. The Orc was mad at the other one for all the killing.
(then)
They have a wand.

GIBSON (SPANISH)
Do they?	Who have you told?

OLD MAN (SPANISH)
Nobody.

GIBSON
Good.

BLAM-BLAM! BLAM-BLAM! Gibson kills them. This person is not a police officer. There’s blood in the air -- And the animals have come out to hunt...


EXT.	SOUTH LA - INTERSECTION - NIGHT

The wrecked cop car still smoking. No movement inside -- Two cars slowly approach. Stop at a distance. Doors open. Poison and six Veteranos get out. SHADOW starts toward the cop car. Poison grabs his collar, stopping him.

POISON
Kick back, fool.

Poison pulls a Mac 10 from his back -- BRDDDDDDDDDT! Punches a couple dozen holes in the wreck. Dogs bark. Lights burn in houses. No one dares come out.

POISON (CONT’D)
Alright, let’s do this.

They advance on the wreck -- Find it empty. Poison reaches in. His fingers come out wet -- Blood. He shows his homies.

SHADOW
Poison, let’s jam outta here before the rollers show up.
 
45.


POISON
Tranquilo, ese. No one’s coming for them or they’d be here. These fools got no ride, no back-up and they’re leaking blood.

SHADOW
So what’s up then?

POISON
I want every homie in the Hood
going door to door like Avon.

These dudes are close.

The Veteranos start texting the world on their cells. Poison squats in the street. Smells the night air. Looks around with a hunter’s eye...


EXT.	SOUTH LA - ALLEY BETWEEN APARTMENTS - NIGHT

BEHIND A DUMPSTER -- Jakoby holds Tikka, one hand over her mouth, the other grips the shotgun. Ward next to them. A bloody cut on his forehead from the crash. The wand is tucked into Jakoby’s belt. Jakoby leans out. SEES Poison and his homies spreading out. Searching.

WARD
Don’t do anything.

JAKOBY
Shut up, man.

WARD
I’m serious.	Be cool.

JAKOBY
I’m not doing shit. They’re gonna fucking hear you. Shut up.

WARD
Uncuff me bro.	Uncuff me.

JAKOBY
Hell no.	Shut up dude.

His teddy-bear personality isn’t built for this intensity.

JAKOBY (CONT’D)
What the fuck did the car hit?

WARD
It’s the wand, man, it went nuts
and we crashed.

(MORE)
 
46.

WARD (CONT'D)
Bet it’s a binding spell, stops it from getting too far from its owner. Nick you have to uncuff me, there’s blood in my eyes.

JAKOBY
Get up. Move. Tikka, stay behind me.

Jakoby roughly pulls Ward to his feet, frog marches him away from the cholos...


EXT.	SOUTH LA - DARK STREET - NIGHT

If you ain’t from here, stay out.	Sad little houses.
Peeling paint.	Iron fences.	Pitbulls.

WARD
We got to get off the street.

JAKOBY
(whispering)

Stop fucking talking!

Two Cholos appear up the street--

JAKOBY (CONT’D)
Shit...

--start running towards towards them! Jakoby decides to stand his ground. Aims the shotgun. Ward pulls away and disappears up a driveway. Tikka looks at Jakoby like he’s crazy and votes with her feet, runs after Ward...


EXT.	SOUTH LA - GARAGE HOUSE - NIGHT

Ward kicks off a padlock then leans on the garage door, using his weight to roll it up. Tikka dives under it. Then Ward drops and rolls inside...


INT.	GARAGE - NIGHT (SAME TIME)

Ward closes it with his boot. Then it rolls back up. Revealing Jakoby -- He had second thoughts. Jakoby closes the door behind him. Tikka cowers in the corner. Ward looks at Jakoby, yell whispers:

WARD
You uncuff me right fuckin’ now
Nick.	I swear to God I’m gonna

lose my shit.
 
47.


Jakoby paces, nervous, shaking his head. They go back and forth in hushed tones...

WARD (CONT’D)
If you ever trusted me, I need you to trust me right now.

JAKOBY
You shot three cops. You whacked out our Sergeant. You’re a fucking psycho. Why dude? Why’d you snap?

WARD
I’ll explain.	It’s me, partner.
It’s still me.	I can explain but
you gotta unhook me.

TIKKA
Shhhhh.

Both men go quiet, listen -- HEAR approaching VOICES. Jakoby looks at Ward. Ward looks at Jakoby. THEN...

Jakoby uncuffs him.	Pulls his Glock.	Hands it to Ward.
They aim their gun at the door.

WARD
Fuck, man, the lock.

JAKOBY
What?

WARD
Lock’s on the ground out there.

The VOICES are close.	Very close.	They wait.	Guns ready.
Tikka says an Elvish prayer to herself.	The VOICES pass.
And fade.	Jakoby lets out a shuddery exhale.


EXT.	SOUTH LA - DARK STREET - NIGHT

Ten Homeboys the block, one with a pair of pitbulls, enter yards and check cars like a Sheriff's posse...


INT.	GARAGE - NIGHT (5 MINUTES LATER)

Tikka draws odd runes in the dust on an old mirror. Jakoby cleans Ward's forehead wound. Ward has been explaining.

WARD
They just turned, man.	They were
like wolves, like fuckin animals.

(MORE)
 
48.

WARD (CONT'D)
I could kill them. Or I could kill you. And I’d never hurt you.

Jakoby lowers his head, sad, weary...

JAKOBY
‘Real Orcs’ don’t give me any respect, I ain’t blooded so they treat me like I’m nothing. Since I was a little kid. And humans hate me cause I’m green.

WARD
That’s not true.

JAKOBY
Stop. We know who likes us and who doesn’t. We picked the wrong side a long time ago and have been paying for it since.
(tearing up)
Shit dude, you’re the only
motherfucker who didn’t look down
on me.	And then you come tearing
outta that house with a look in

your eye like you hated me.

WARD
...I don’t hate you...

JAKOBY
I’m sorry I lied to you.

They are still brothers.	It feels good.

WARD
Nick, what the fuck are we gonna

do?	What’s our gameplan here?

JAKOBY
We’re not calling anyone in the department. That’s for sure. Let’s take someone’s car. And get out of this neighborhood.

WARD
The wand will just stop us again.

JAKOBY
Then we leave the wand.

WARD
No way.	Even without a bright,
dude, you took History.

(MORE)
 
49.

WARD (CONT'D)
In the wrong hands it’s bodies in
the streets.	It’s all of LA on

fire.

JAKOBY
The Feds are the obvious play here.

WARD
I’m not in a good spot, bro. With three dead cops on my gun.

JAKOBY
I...shit.	Bro you need to say
something positive right now.

WARD
Can’t lie, you look pretty bad ass with the shotgun.

Jakoby laughs -- Then bingo...

WARD (CONT’D)
I got it. Rodriguez. Dude’s solid as fuck. We call Rodriguez, he’s still working. He can--

--Tikka speaks up, startling them both...

TIKKA
(subtitled)

She’s coming for her wand. We must go.

WARD
What’d she say?

JAKOBY
(subtitled, to Tikka)

Who will come looking?

She points at the wand in Jakoby’s belt and whispers...

TIKKA
(subtitled)

The witch.

Jakoby REACTS...

WARD
Nick?	Translate please.

There’s a NOISE OUTSIDE -- They freeze...
 
50.


EXT.	SOUTH LA - GARAGE HOUSE - NIGHT

The Pitbulls strain against their chains as ten armed VETERANOS stare at the garage door. Poison picks up the lock. Turns to the others with a finger over his lips.

POISON
...shhhh...

Nods for a Veterano to open the door.	Guns are raised...


INT.	GARAGE HOUSE - NIGHT (SAME TIME)

Jakoby and Ward enter the connected house from the back of the garage with Tikka in tow and silently clear the dark house. They startle a Latina SINGLE MOM in her pajamas...

SINGLE MOM
Por favor, no me hagan daño.

WARD
Calmate.	No le vamos a hacer nada.

In a carseat on the table, her Baby starts CRYING. Ward and Jakoby exchange a look. Tikka alert with fear.

WARD (CONT’D)
Que callas al bebe por favor.

The gangsters outside circle like jackals -- Their menacing SHADOWS sweeping across the curtains. They are being surrounded -- Now the Baby starts SCREAMING.

WARD (CONT’D)
Muevate.

The woman grabs her baby from the carseat. The Baby SCREAMS EVEN LOUDER...

WARD (CONT’D)
Que callas al bebe. Shut your fucking baby up right now, shut it up right now.

SINGLE MOM
Lo siento.	Perdoname.

WARD
Don’t fucking apologize, lady.

Shut your fucking kid up right now.

She frantically shushes the baby. Impossibly the baby HOWLS louder and LOUDER. The tension unbearable.
 
51.


Jakoby looks to Ward, frantic. Acting on pure instinct, Ward pushes the woman to the ground...

WARD (CONT’D)
Stay low, don’t m--

BRDDDDDDT! BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM! The gangsters open fire on the house. Windows explode. Bullets rip through the walls.

WARD (CONT’D)
We’re not stayin here and getting

them killed.	Move!	Move!

With bullets SMASHING all around them, Ward and Jakoby make a break for the back door with Tikka in tow...


EXT.	GARAGE HOUSE - BACKYARD - NIGHT (SAME TIME)

Jakoby nearly takes the back door off its hinges. A VETERANO is right there! He opens fire -- POP-POP-POP!

KABOOM! -- Jakoby fires the shotgun. Shredding the fucker. Ward covers Tikka’s eyes so she doesn’t see the body. Jakoby jumps a fence. Ward hands him Tikka and follows...


EXT.	SOUTH LA - LONG ALLEY - NIGHT (SAME TIME)

Veteranos YELLING. WHISTLING. Ward and Jakoby running. Jakoby holding Tikka. Two Veteranos vault the fence into the alley and open fire -- POP-POP-POP-POP!

Ward stops.	Draws and aims.	Bullets ZIP past his head.
Ward focuses on breathing.	Sight picture.	Trigger squeeze.

BAM-BAM! -- The two Veteranos drop with headshots. Say what you want about Ward but the dude’s a natural born gunfighter. He runs to catch up to Jakoby...


EXT.	SOUTH LA - ANOTHER STREET - NIGHT (SAME TIME)

Jakoby and Ward running. Tikka in Jakoby’s arms. We hear the WHISTLES and SHOUTS of the angry storm of Gangsters intercepting them...

UP THE STREET -- Is a raucous HOUSE PARTY. Bass THUMPS. Vapes glow. 40’s are drained. Girls in underwear are hosed down. Fun and games to escape the heat.

WARD
There, go go!
 
52.


They cut towards the party.	Tikka SCREAMS in warning...

BEHIND THEM -- Ten Altamira Soldiers explode out of the alley behind them. Sprinting like cheetahs on the Serengeti. Cheetahs with guns -- POP-POP-POP-POP!

Ward stops and turns to return fire -- THWAP! -- HE’S IMMEDIATELY SPUN BY A BULLET HITTING HIS LEFT ARM.

WARD (CONT’D)
Arghhhh.	Fuck!	Fuck!

He drops to a knee. Aims one handed -- BLAM-BLAM-BLAM! Drops another asshole. Scattering the Gangsters, buying precious seconds. Ward keeps running...

JAKOBY
Scott!?

WARD
Keep going!


INT.	FOGTEETH PARTY HOUSE - NIGHT

PARTYGOERS react to the gunfire. Squatting down as one does in the Hood. They’re mostly ORCS, many in Fogteeth Gang colors -- Black and orange. They aren’t happy to see the cops...

WHACK! -- An Altamira bullet hits the porch. Now the Orcs pull guns and RETURN FIRE!

ORC VOICES
... Fogteeth motherfuckers! ...
... This is Fogteeth’s Hood! ...

... Fogteeth for life! ...

Ward and Jakoby run straight past them into:


INT.	FOGTEETH PARTY HOUSE - NIGHT (SAME TIME)

Claustrophobic, dark and way too loud. Crowded with dancing bodies. Mostly Orcs. A few Humans. With no clue about the drama outside. Jakoby and Ward plowing through them. Ward's blood-slick arm smears a HOTTIE. She starts SCREAMING.

Getting them noticed...

Orcs close around Ward. Shoving him roughly. Jakoby sees one draw a knife! Jakoby covers Tikka’s eyes and PEPPER SPRAYS THE ENTIRE ROOM! The fucking Red Sea parts and Jakoby grabs Ward by his belt...
 
53.


EXT.	SOUTH LA - FOGTEETH PARTY HOUSE - BACKYARD - NIGHT

Jakoby crashes out the back door dragging a blinded and bloodied Ward and a screaming Tikka. Livid pepper sprayed Orcs following him out...

KABOOM! -- Jakoby fires the shotgun in the air and growls something in ORKISH. Stalling their pursuers. He scoops up Tikka and hauls Ward through the back gate into another alley. They disappear into the night...


EXT.	SOUTH LA - INTERSECTION - NIGHT

Cowboy and Slasher regarding the wrecked black and white. Gibsons circling it in silence. She looks up, studies the houses. Measuring time and distance in her mind. She notices something on the ground. Crosses to it...

Footprints -- In black iridescent blood, like gasoline.

SLASHER
What’s up, Gibson?

GIBSON
The bright.	Looking for the wand.

SLASHER
This change anything?

GIBSON
Yes. We’re not the biggest shark in the water. So we have to be the smartest.


EXT.	SOUTH LA - DEAD END STREET - NIGHT

Kandomere KNOCKS on the back of an old plumbing van hidden in the shadows. Nothing. Grabs door handle. The door falls off CLATTERING to the street...

Revealing two OBLITERATED BODIES inside! The first has been blasted into what looks like red spider-webs. The other is shattered like glass. It’s clear from the equipment racks it’s a SURVEILLANCE VAN. Montehugh joins Kandomere, holding two assault rifles...

KANDOMERE
The bright was here.

Montehugh tosses Kandomere a rifle. The hair stands up on the back of his neck when he SEES his colleagues are now modern art displays...
 
54.


MONTEHUGH
Lemme get local PD down here to

contain the area.

KANDOMERE
Take a beat on that. Until we know who’s who and what’s what.

They’re a few houses up 341 Abrams -- Kandomere steps out into the street and SEES parked black and white just visible. Nods for Montehugh to follow...


EXT.	SOUTH LA - 341 ABRAMS - NIGHT

Kandomere and Montehugh approach on foot, cautious, rifles in low ready position. They SEE BROWN, the fratboy cop from the station. Talking on his cell. He quickly hangs up...

KANDOMERE
What do you got?

BROWN
Sir this is LAPD business, we have an active crime scene.

KANDOMERE
(flashing badge)
Homeland Security Magic Task Force.

It’s my crime scene now.

BROWN
Sorry, sir. Uh. Yes. Sure. But look, it’s all fucked.

KANDOMERE
Mind if we drill down a bit on what you mean by ‘fucked’?

BROWN
There was a shooting between the
responding officers.	I got three
dead cops.	Two more missing.	A
dead couple with gunshot wounds
across the street.	Four bodies
inside.	And someone staging and
cleaning the crime scene.	That’s
what I meant by fucked, sir.

KANDOMERE
Where’s the bright come into this?
 
55.


BROWN
The four bodies from the original
call are magicked the fuck up.
(then)

Who called you?

KANDOMERE
This is a Shield Of Light safehouse. An extremist group convinced the Dark Lord will return and initiate a second Age of Magic.

BROWN
The crazy ass conspiracy theorists? They just hand out fliers on the corner. It’s bullshit.

KANDOMERE
Right. Until someone kills four of them and the two Agents surveilling them with a magic wand. Then, I’m not so sure.

BROWN
You guys been watching this place?

MONTEHUGH
Agent Kandomere?

He nods for him to join him. Out of earshot. For all of Kandomere’s Elvish wisdom and intellect, he’s not streetsmart like Montehugh.

MONTEHUGH (CONT’D) Hey. We gotta get Vance’s people down here right the fuck now and lock this place down. Local PD’s got some dirty ass Rampart shit going down. There’s a wand on the streets. All bets are off.

Kandomere processing. He’s right. The two Agents fading back to the street...

KANDOMERE
Pull the hard drive from the van.
Right now.	We need those

recordings safe.

Kandomere dials his cell...

INTERCUT:
 
56.


INT.	TASK FORCE LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT (SAME TIME)

A dozen Federal Swat Operators towel off, overdo Axe body spray, comb their hair carefully. It’s Friday night and time to slay it in the bars after a long training day. GORDON VANCE, Alpha of these Alphas, grabs his RINGING cell...

GORDON VANCE
Vance.

KANDOMERE
Where are you?

GORDON VANCE
Up at the facility. We’re punching out for the day.

KANDOMERE
No you’re not. Shit went down at the Shield of Light House we’ve been watching. The bright killed everyone inside and killed my men monitoring the place. The bright’s here. Here in LA.

GORDON VANCE
Aw fuck, man.

KANDOMERE
LAPD’s all twisted up in this. I’m behind enemy lines with no back-up. You’re it. Get down here. At the speed of light.

GORDON VANCE
We’re in fucking Lancaster, boss. It’s gonna be while. Stay safe and hang on.

Vance hangs up.	SIGHS.	Turns to the boys...

GORDON VANCE (CONT’D) Suit back up! We got a magic user on the street. Grab your gear and get on the road!

Their REACTIONS say it all. A bright? Magic user? They know people are going to die tonight...

END INTERCUT:

Kandomere hangs up.	Worry etched on his face.
 
57.


INT.	341 ABRAMS - NIGHT

Kandomere and Montehugh looking through the mess...

MONTEHUGH
We got the two bodies in the
kitchen and the one in back the
bright wanded.	The guy the first
responders shot.	We know the Elf

Girl was taken.

KANDOMERE
Someone’s missing.

Kandomere charges upstairs with Montehugh in tow...


INT.	341 ABRAMS - UPSTAIRS HALL - NIGHT

Kandomere studies the walls...

MONTEHUGH
We searched up here.

KANDOMERE
I hear a candle burning.

He pulls down a bookcase revealing a hidden door. He draws a pistol open it. Revealing...


INT.	341 ABRAMS - SHRINE ROOM - NIGHT

A single candle burns on an altar. Various magic relics and scrolls. On the floor is a dead human -- His upper body has been turned to solid gold! Montehugh blinks...

KANDOMERE
They’re training a bright.

BEHIND THEM -- Is Brown.	Gold fever in his greedy eyes...

MONTEHUGH
Get the fuck outta here.	That’s
evidence.

BROWN
Evidence?	Looks like a house in
Big Bear and a new Tesla to me.

Kandomere and Montehugh give him withering looks. Brown just smiles and backs away...

WE FOLLOW BROWN -- As he pulls his cell and dials...
 
58.


BROWN (CONT’D)
(into phone)
Get down here right now.	I found

something interesting.


INT.	GAS STATION - NIGHT

Jakoby sets water bottles on the counter. Looking just beat to shit. Smiles at the CLERK, a hardass Korean man behind Plexiglas. Jakoby grabs a handful of candybars.

CLERK
Are you a real cop?

JAKOBY
Yeah.	I’m a real cop.

CLERK
But you’re green.

JAKOBY
I’m blue.	Cops are blue.

Jakoby pays the man.


INT.	SHERRI’S MOM’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Ward's daughter Sophia lays under a blanket with a flashlight. Drawing a picture with crayons. Her grandmother pulls the blanket aside.

SHERRI’S MOTHER
You’re supposed to be sleeping

young lady.

SOPHIA
I’m making daddy a card.

She shows grandma a crude drawing of Ward, Jakoby and herself under a smiling sun. It reads: “SORRY I WAS MEAN DADDY I LOVE YOU SO MUCH EVERYTHING WILL BE OK!”


EXT.	GAS STATION - ROUND BACK - NIGHT

Jakoby gives Ward a water.	Tikka curled up, asleep.

JAKOBY
How the fuck is she sleeping?
 
59.


WARD
Adrenaline dump.	She shut right
down.	Sophia does it too.

Jakoby sits.	He and Ward tap waters -- “Cheers”

JAKOBY
Your arm okay?

WARD
My arm’s fucked.

JAKOBY
Can you move it?

WARD
I can move it.

JAKOBY
Bro.	Running into a Fogteeth
party?	Man, I don’t know about
that.	That was a bad move.

WARD
I didn’t deploy pepper spray.

JAKOBY
I’m just saying, Orcs hold grudges.
(then)

That crazy homeless fucker we hooked this afternoon? Remember what all he was saying? Like you think there’s a chance we’re ... in a prophecy right now?

WARD
It was just a coincidence.	Shit
happens.	Shit is happening.
(a beat, sadly)
You know there’s no way we’re still cops after this.

JAKOBY
...are you sure..?

Yeah.	He’s sure.	Jakoby visibly sags.	He needs hope.

JAKOBY (CONT’D)
Why choose me as your partner?	I
mean, no one wanted to work with

me.	But you did.

WARD
I dunno man.	You seemed cool.
 
60.


JAKOBY
I couldn’t believe it ‘cause to me you were like, you know. You’re the guy on the poster. You’re fearless. You always know what to do.

WARD
Except for the dating thing.

JAKOBY
That’s how you get blooded as an Orc. You do an act of great bravery. And what you did back there ... I mean the way I see it, you’re a blooded human now. You’re who I want be.

WARD
Nick. You’re a good cop and a good guy. It’s just that everyone’s really hard on you. So you are too.

Jakoby can see that.	Then...

WARD (CONT’D)
Why’d you to lie to me, man?	I’m
not saying shit would’a gone down

different, but it might have.

JAKOBY
Dunno. I just lied. And then with humans, everything’s so fucking definite. You know? You say one thing and then it’s like law and you can’t walk it back. I got confused.

WARD
Okay.	We make it through the
night: just clue me in next time,

dumbass.

JAKOBY
Sorry, man.	You’re right.

A siren WHOOPS -- A BLACK AND WHITE PULLS UP -- Jakoby and Ward grab their weapons. On high alert. Tikka stirs...

RODRIGUEZ
Drop your fucking guns!	Right now!
 
61.


It’s Rodriguez in his Sheriff’s car -- He pops out with his pistol aimed at them -- Ward protectively guards Tikka. Jakoby lays his shotgun on the ground. Then Ward his pistol.

WARD
Not you too, man.

RODRIGUEZ
“Not me too” what? There’s a shit-load of radio traffic about you guys. Shooting cops? Evading?

WARD
It’s complicated.

RODRIGUEZ
I’m taking you into custody.

WARD
We got a wand with us. It was at a call with this kid. Everything went sideways. The guys on our watch lost their shit and were gonna do us over the wand.

RODRIGUEZ
Show me the wand.

Jakoby looks at Ward -- Who shakes his head: No. Jakoby takes the wand from his belt, shows Rodriquez anyway...

RODRIGUEZ (CONT’D) Aw shit. Just put it down. Please. We gotta evacuate this neighborhood. Look. I’m calling my supervisor. I’ll blow you outta your socks if you make a move.

WARD
Rodriguez. Don’t call it in man. There’s major forces at play here. We don’t know who’s dirty and who’s not. This is a fucking magic wand, dude.

RODRIGUEZ
Shut up.

Ward turns to Jakoby and smiles -- A callback to earlier...

WARD
See how it feels?
(as Jakoby)

Shut up shut up shut up.
 
62.


JAKOBY
Shut up.

RODRIGUEZ
I’ll call the Magic Taskforce, We’ll get the feds here, the big guns. I’ll keep you guys safe. But priority one is to keep the wand out of the wrong hands. Right now I don’t trust anybody but the feds.

Rodriguez is one of the good guys. No doubt. Ward sighs, nearly collapsing onto Jakoby, who lets out a sob-like noise of relief. Rodriguez dialing his cell...


EXT.	SOUTH LA - BEHIND A BUILDING - NIGHT (SAME TIME)

Gibson watches Slasher swing an axe at a bundle of cables on a steel pole -- THWACK! -- There’s a shower of sparks...

TILT UP TO REVEAL -- He’s just disabled a CELLPHONE TOWER...


EXT.	GAS STATION - ROUND BACK - NIGHT

Rodriguez looks at his phone. He lost signal. The significance isn’t lost on him...

RODRIGUEZ
Ward, I need you to cuff Jakoby.
For my safety and your safety.

Then I’m going to cuff you.

Ward not a fan of that...

JAKOBY
Just do it, Scott.	It is what is.
I’m tired of running.

Ward cuffs Jakoby. It’s hateful. Rodriguez approaches Ward. Cuffs him. Searches him, tossing away his knives and back-up gun. Searches Jakoby, tossing away his weapons, his keys.

RODRIGUEZ
It doesn’t look good. A green cop and three dead humans?

WARD
The fuck is that supposed to mean?
 
63.


RODRIGUEZ
I’m not being a dick. I’m being real as fuck. They’re gonna want it to be Jakoby. Even if it’s not.

JAKOBY
I can’t go to prison.	Big Orc
Family runs that shit.	They’ll
fucking skin me alive.

WARD
You’re not going to prison. I did it. I shot everyone.

RODRIGUEZ
Both you guys need to shut up and lawyer up. I’m gonna Mirandize you. Then you’re getting counsel. Promise me. Whatever went down, the truth always comes out. No matter how painful--

--THWACK! Rodriguez’s chest explodes! He pitches forward and hits the ground...

REVEALING GIBSON BEHIND HIM! -- Stalking forward with an automatic weapon...

WARD
No no no!

He tries to protect Tikka -- But Tikka isn’t having it -- She runs out, grabs Jakoby’s keys and throws them to Ward. Smart girl. Jakoby snatches up the wand. The three of them bolt for the front of the Gas Station...
