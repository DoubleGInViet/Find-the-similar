BRDDDDDDDT! -- Gibson chases them with a burst -- Hitting Rodriguez’s car -- Spraying them with glass and plastic...

INT.	GAS STATION - NIGHT (SAME TIME)

Jakoby and Ward hug the floor, uncuffing each other with the keys Tikka recovered...

WARD
Who the fuck is that?

Now the Apocalypse starts -- BRDDDDDDDDDDDDDDT!

Bullets shatter windows and rip apart shelves, filling the air with Slim Jims and Flamin Hot Fritos. Wall coolers explode with rainbow bursts of colored soda. A pause in the gunfire -- The Clerk pops up with a magnum and a scowl...
 
64.


JAKOBY
Sir!	Stay down!

THWAP! -- The Clerk is cored out with a slug, blood paints the inside of his Plexiglas security window...


EXT.	SOUTH LA - GAS STATION - NIGHT (SAME TIME)

Slasher jacks a fresh round into his sniper rifle. His weapon lays across the hood of a random parked car.

SLASHER
(into radio)

Target down.	You’re clear.

ON GIBSON -- She shoulders her weapon and scans the shattered windows for movement.


INT.	GAS STATION - NIGHT

It’s quiet. Just the sound of leaking soda. Ward nods at the back door. Jakoby shakily nods back. To Tikka...

WARD
Sweetheart I need you to run. As fast as you can. We have to cross the street. Run and don’t look back. Okay Tikka?

Tikka looks up and nods once.	Ward turns to Jakoby:

WARD (CONT’D)
On three.	One--

--Jakoby is already up and moving. Shit. Ward and Tikka follow, staying low...

BRDDDDDDT! -- Gunfire rakes the walls. Jakoby is first through the back door...


EXT.	SOUTH LA - GAS STATION - NIGHT (SAME TIME)

Ward, Jakoby and Tikka exit -- BRDDDDDT! -- Cowboy is right there and opens fire! Tikka balks, Ward scoops her up with his good arm...

It’s Jakoby’s turn to shine -- He scoops up the shotgun, turns and fires -- KABOOM! -- The blast flooring Cowboy!

Now Slasher appears from the side -- BRDDDT! His burst crashes into Jakoby’s shotgun, smashing the receiver.
 
65.


In a fit of rage Jakoby hurls the shotgun Slasher with all his considerable might...

Slasher just blocks it from smashing his skull, but is sent tumbling ass over tea kettle. Ward, Jakoby and Tikka make it across the street. Vanishing between a row of shops...

Gibson arrives to find Slasher staggering to his feet. And Cowboy laying in an expanding pool of blood, already slapping on a bandage. He’s one tough motherfucker...

COWBOY
I’m fine.	I got it.

Gibson doesn’t wait for them. She stalks her prey across the street...


EXT.	SOUTH LA - FREEWAY UNDERPASS - NIGHT

Ward, Jakoby and Tikka running. Suddenly wand in Jakoby’s belt begins GLOWING -- He’s YANKED BACKWARDS -- Lands hard on his back, the wand falling free:

Once again they went too far and too fast and triggered the spell binding the wand to its owner -- Whoever or whatever that may be...

Jarred loose, the wand lays in the street, next to Jakoby. Ward rushes back to help his partner. Finds Jakoby is stunned. His uniform smoking from the wand.

WARD
Nick, you okay?	Shit, you gotta
get up, dude.

A black Escalade screams into the underpass. Onto the sidewalk next to them -- Ward sits up Jakoby...

WARD (CONT’D)
We’re moving.	Now.

Jakoby staggers to his feet. SCREECH! -- A second Escalade screams up, boxing them in. Ward reaches for his gun. Remembers it’s not there.

JAKOBY
This night’s gettin’ better and

better.

Ten FOGTEETH ORCS pop out in unison. Big, bad, scary and pissed off. We may recognize them from the party. Ward knows they’re fucked. But he can’t help smiling...
 
66.


WARD
Hey guys. Look. I’m going to give you a pass for the reckless driving. I need you to return to your vehicles. And drive away. Safely.

Jakoby drops his head in his hands -- Oh God did he just do that? Even the Fogteeth Orcs pause. DORGHU, the pack leader, cocks his massive gnarled head...

DORGHU
You think it’s funny to trash our
home and disrespect our

celebration?	Pinkskin?

WARD
Guys. Seriously. I’m not in the mood. This is your last chance to walk away or you’re all going to jail.

The Orcs trade looks -- ‘The balls on this guy!’ They close in so Ward throws the first punch! He’s hurled to the ground and the beating begins. They just pummel Ward and Jakoby.

Tikka screams in fear!

NEW ANGLE -- Gibson is just visible down the block. Frowning at this new development...


INT.	FOGTEETH SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT

The windows are boarded, the furniture torn. Orc black velvet paintings and Orc kitsch decorate the place. The room is packed with FOGTEETH ORCS of various shapes and sizes, all repping their gang with black and orange.

Kneeling among them on the floor are Jakoby and Ward. Tikka between them, crying silently. Dorghu kneels in front of Jakoby. He smiles. Fatherly.

DORGHU
You know I’m not from here. I grew up in Miami. Great orc communities there, strong orc communities.

We’d have block parties with dwarves, humans, it was fun. I wasn’t in the game then. I was a bus driver. Then I move to LA. City of Angels, right? I see these kids, I see how broken the system you got here is.

(MORE)
 
67.

DORGHU (CONT'D)
Orcs caught between the police and the gangsters. I see I need to change. And I do. I organize things. We have our own thing now. I know what I am. And I still give back to the community. Not just Orcs. Every month I throw a big house-party, get people drunk. Feed them. Whole neighborhood’s invited, black, brown, yellow, green. Partying together. With one rule - No guns, no fights inside. It’s sanctuary. Three years of peace. And who breaks sanctuary? Who’s first to bring in guns? The motherfucking police.

He sighs, runs a curious finger across Jakoby’s filed teeth.
Time to teach the youngsters...

DORGHU (CONT’D)
An unblooded orc. And a cop. Grew up with humans. Never had a claw raised for him in his life. Playing the “nice guy” the “sweet guy.” Your buddies so happy to say they have an “orc friend.” Here’s your opportunity to give back.

He switches to orkish, suddenly animalistic, he snarls:

DORGHU (CONT’D)
(subtitled)

Where is the wand?

Jakoby is silent, breathing hard. Dorghu nods to a couple BIG ORCS -- They begin WHIPPING JAKOBY AND WARD WITH STEEL CHAINS! The Two men scream in agony.

WARD
Fuck!	You!

Tikka SHRIEKS in a panic, her whole body shaking convulsively. Dorghu suddenly grabs her by the face.

DORGHU
(subtitled)

Where is the wand?

Eyes wide with fear, Tikka speaks in shaky English...

TIKKA
There is no wand.
 
68.


Dorghu stares at Tikka, then nods to Jakoby, who is pulled up to his knees. He grabs Jakoby’s face.

DORGHU
Roundtooth. False orc. Unblooded coward.

The other Orcs murmur in agreement, Jakoby stares at Dorghu.

DORGHU (CONT’D)
Where is the wand?

Jakoby sneers -- WHAM! -- Dorghu PUNCHES HIM IN THE FACE, grabs his ear...

DORGHU (CONT’D)
Where is the wand, boy?

WARD
There’s no wand, dude.

DORGHU
Was I talking to you pinkface!?

JAKOBY
There is no wand.

Dorghu pulls an Orkish ceremonial dagger.	Ornate.	Ancient.

DORGHU
Where is the wand?

JAKOBY
What wand?

Dorghu grins. Predatory. Stabs down into the top of Jakoby’s shoulder. Jakoby ROARS in pain. Dorghu drives him to the floor with a knee in the chest. And twists the knife.

WARD
You motherfucker! Stop it! Leave him alone you piece of shit.

A Big Orc loops a chain around Ward’s neck. Hauls back making his eyes bulge. Ward claws the air. Dorghu will kill Jakoby if he doesn’t stop. Each word a knife twist...

DORGHU
Where.	Is.	The.	Wand?

JAKOBY
(agony)

There’s no wand!	Arggh!
 
69.


DORGHU
Altamira thinks there’s a wand.

The Orc choking Ward loosens his grip.	Ward coughs this out:

WARD
First, you seriously need to pop a gum. Second, there never was a fuckin wand. Altamira’s a bunch of crackheads. It’s ghetto rumors, dude. Just ghetto rumors.

DORGHU
The police think there’s a wand.
The feds think there’s a wand.
(roars)

I think there’s a wand!

WHACK! -- A Fogteeth Orc PUNCHES WARD in the jaw, knocking him to the floor. Dorghu rips his dagger from Jakoby. And grabs Tikka by her hair. Ward gets deliberate and quiet...

WARD
Please leave her alone. She’s just a little girl. She’s going home. Let her go home.

He’s WHIPPED WITH A CHAIN, screams in pain.

JAKOBY
We’re police officers!	You can’t
do this!

An orc kicks Jakoby down, stomps his face into the floor.
Again and again.	Breaking his nose...

Now both of the cops lay defeated, broken, rasping in pain.
Dorghu presses his dagger to Tikka’s throat...

DORGHU
I’ll cover you with her hot blood.

Where is the wand?

The cops just moan in pain. Dorghu wrenches Tikka’s tiny, fragile arm. She cries out in pain...

Ward looks at her. She looks at him -- Telling him to STAY STRONG with her eyes -- A flicker of respect and awe roll across Ward’s face -- This little girl is someone special.

WARD
I don’t know! I don’t know where the wand is, I don’t fucking know!
 
70.


Dorghu senses he’s been bested but doesn’t understand how. It’s over -- He nods to his subordinates. Ward, Jakoby and Tikka are dragged down the hallway into...


INT.	FOGTEETH SAFE HOUSE - PIT ROOM - NIGHT (SAME TIME)

THE FLOOR HAS BEEN RIPPED OUT -- Above an incredibly deep pit, dug deep beneath the house, vanishing into darkness.

Ward and Jakoby are laid face down so their heads hang over the edge. The Big Orcs stand over them, a boot on their backs. Ward and Jakoby staring into the abyss. They trade looks and sad little smiles -- Each saying to the other “I’m with you my brother, I’m with you.”

Dorghu’s huge paw clasping Tikka’s throat...

DORGHU
Watch your friends.

Ward fights back tears...

WARD
I’m sorry, Sophia. I’m so sorry. Please forgive me! I didn’t say goodbye. I didn’t say I love you.

The Orcs are all business now. Ward and Jakoby are just objects to be disposed of. Both men now stoic. Tikka sobbing. Dorghu tries one last time...

DORGHU
Where is the wand?

JAKOBY
There is no fucking wand, stupid.

Dorghu stares at them, and then:

DORGHU
Kill them.

A Big Orc presses a shotgun to the back of Jakoby’s head. An ORC GANGSTER steps up with a fucking big bolt action deer rifle. CLACK-CLACKS a round in the chamber. Holds the muzzle to the back of Ward’s head. The Gangster hesitates...

ORC GANGSTER
(subtitled)

Wait.

All the Orcs look at him.
 
71.


ORC GANGSTER (CONT’D)
Turn over.

Ward slowly turns over.

ORC GANGSTER (CONT’D)
You too.

Jakoby turns over, his smashed nose bleeds into his eyes...

DORGHU
(subtitled)

What are you doing?

ORC GANGSTER
(subtitled)
Father, I am sorry, I know these

men.

All of the Orcs wait expectantly.

ORC GANGSTER (CONT’D)
(subtitled)
I was in the swap meet going to
school when an Orc from another
Clan lit up a liquor store.
(re: Jakoby)
He saw me and chased me. I was trapped. And he saw I was the wrong Orc. He helped me escape the police. The human police.

Dorghu processing this...

ORC GANGSTER (CONT’D)
(subtitled)

I owe him an honor debt. We cannot kill them.

DORGHU
(subtitled)

They mock us.

ORC GANGSTER
(subtitled)

Maybe there is no wand.

Father and son stare at each other. The father nods, releases Tikka. Kneels by Jakoby.

DORGHU
What did you call me roundtooth?

“Stupid?”
 
72.


Dorghu pulls him up by the shirt -- WHAM! Punches his face, now he stomps his ribs, his legs. The Orc Gangster cringes.

DORGHU (CONT’D)
(subtitled)

False orc!	Unblooded coward!

He stomps and stomps. Ward’s heart breaking as Nick’s blood spatters his face...


INT.	SURVEILLANCE VAN - NIGHT

Montehugh’s laptop connected to the server rack...

KANDOMERE
Any luck?

MONTEHUGH
Drive’s fried. The wand cooked it. If there’s video of our bright, it’ll take a forensic lab to recover it.

Kandomere frowns.

KANDOMERE
Pull the drive and bag it.

Then Kandomere sees something...

KANDOMERE (CONT’D)
Shit.	We got company.


EXT.	341 ABRAMS - NIGHT

A couple cars of LAPD SWAT COPS has pulled up. Brown talking to them excitedly. Kandomere and Montehugh rapidly approach the knot of cops. Wearing body armor over civilian clothes.

KANDOMERE
Evening. Can I help you? Who are you?

BROWN
Easy, sir. I called them. We’re a little short handed.

Kandomere turns to the SWAT SERGEANT...
 
73.


KANDOMERE
Fine. Gimme a perimeter. Take the corners of the block. And stay out of sight.

SWAT SERGEANT
You’re not in charge here.

KANDOMERE
What the fuck did you say to me?

BROWN
I think you heard him.	This is
LAPD’s jurisdiction.

KANDOMERE
I’m a federal agent. It’s your jurisdiction but it’s my country. Now all of you get the fuck off my crime scene.

SWAT SERGEANT
We’re not debating this.	Elf.

Kandomere grinds his jaw in disbelief. Montehugh gripping is carbine. Thumb on the safety. The tension is very real.

KANDOMERE
(quietly)

Don’t let them out of your sight. When the Strike Team gets here, we’re arresting all these assholes.

Kandomere turns and heads for the house. A SWAT COP blocks him. Montehugh scanning the big men with scary faces.

KANDOMERE (CONT’D)
Step aside.

SWAT COP
I will put you in handcuffs,

compadre.

KANDOMERE
Get the fuck out of my way.

The SWAT COP shoves him.	Kandomere stares at him, intense.
The moment hangs pregnant in time.	With eerie calm...

KANDOMERE (CONT’D) What’s your plan? You know I’m an elf, right? I can hear your heart speeding up. I can smell the adrenaline in your sweat.
 
74.


Brown is right there.	Menacing...

BROWN
Can you dodge a bullet?

MONTEHUGH
Kandomere.	We’re going.

BRDDDDDDT! -- Brown and the SWAT Cops open fire. Montehugh falls dead -- But Kandomere flips backwards. Repeatedly, weaving and spinning as bullets hit all around him. Insanely agile. Moving as only an Elf can. He dives in his SUV. Punches the gas and tears out of there.

TICK-TICK-POCK! -- Bullets smashing into the back as he goes.
He disappears up the block.	The SWAT Cops about to pursue.
Brown WHISTLES piercingly...

BROWN
Hey! No, no! Stay on mission. We grab the gold and find the wand.


EXT.	SOUTH LA - EMPTY LOT - NIGHT

The neighborhood illegal trash dump. Ward and Jakoby are shoved out of a truck. Then Tikka is pushed out as well. Both of them are virtually pulped at this point. But Jakoby is in truly dire shape. Ward crawls to him...

WARD
Nick?	Nick?	Can you hear me?

JAKOBY
... my leg’s broken ... my ribs ...

I can’t breathe ... I’m done ...

WARD
No you’re not. Hold on. I’ll get you help. Don’t leave me, brother.

Jakoby fading -- The beating broke something important inside. Ward grabs his arm, tries to drag him to the street. But Jakoby’s too big and Ward is too weak. Ward collapses, screams at the dark houses, clutching Jakoby in his arms.

WARD (CONT’D)
Somebody help us!	This is a good
man here!	Help this man!	He’s a
good man.	Help him!

Tikka slowly approaches. Ward notices her. She has a steely look in her eye. The with a flick of her wrist -- THE WAND APPEARS FROM NOWHERE RIGHT IN HER HAND! Ward stunned...
 
75.


WARD (CONT’D)
Holy shit.	You’re a bright.
You’re a fucking bright.	You had
the wand the whole time.

Tikka speaks quietly, nervously...

TIKKA
(subtitled)

My job was to learn magic to keep a wand safe. The Dark Lord will return and I am meant to fight him. But I have no wand of my own. A witch came to kill me and the Brothers of Light saved me. The witch left her wand behind.

WARD
I don’t understand you. I have no idea what you’re saying. I’m sorry.

TIKKA
(subtitled)

I can’t fix him.

WARD
I don’t know what that means.	I
don’t know what you’re saying.

TIKKA
(broken English)

If I use this ...	Witch find us.

WARD
Fuck the witch.	If you can help
him, then help him.	He was ready
to die for you.

Tikka sees the desperation in Ward’ face. She motions for him to get back. Tikka centers herself. Rubs her hands. Then points the wand at Jakoby and whispers:

TIKKA
Mendovia.

A beautiful, rippling pulse of “energy” drifts off the wand and passes over Jakoby’s limp form -- Instantaneously we hear CLICKS and SNAPS as Jakoby’s body repairs itself!

WARD
Oh holy shit.	Oh wow.
 
76.


Jakoby suddenly sits up, spitting out blood and sucking in air. Ward rushes in to help him, but Jakoby pushes him away. He’s not dying, but not a 100%. We can feel Ward’s relief.

Tikka passes out cold. Bleeding from her ear. Dangerously drained...

WARD (CONT’D)
You okay?	Tikka?	You gonna be
okay?

Jakoby scoops her up like a ragdoll. Slides the wand back into his belt. Helps Ward up.

JAKOBY
C’mon partner. I got you. We have to keep moving.

They start walking -- An odd little family: A big Orc, a broken man, a tiny Elf Girl. Tikka leads the way. A little warrior, who has been called to fight much too soon.


EXT.	SOUTH LA - DARK ALLEY - NIGHT (SAME TIME)

CAMERA FOLLOWS gloppy footprints of black, shiny blood. They lead to bare feet which drag, shuffle and twitch ... WE TILT UP and SEE a veiny woman’s body in a ratty dress. This is THE WITCH. The wand’s owner...

Tikka’s voice rolls in like a distant echo -- “Mendovia.”

The Witch’s face whips toward us -- Stringy black hair on a patchy scalp framing her sunken pink eyes. Her face a well of darkness as she sniffs the air...

THE WITCH
....Mine...


EXT.	SOUTH LA - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

GIBSON’S SUV parked in the shadows. Cowboy in back. He’s breathing slow. But still in the game. Slasher listens to RADIO INTERCEPT equipment, rapt. Gibson drums her fingernails on the steering wheel.

GIBSON
What’s so interesting?

SLASHER
Bunch’a LAPD SWAT guys racing balls out to the bright house.
 
77.


GIBSON
You sure? I haven’t heard anything on their Tac Channels.

SLASHER
They’re not on department Icoms.
They’re running encrypted
satphones.	This is eight or so
SWAT operators working off the

books.

COWBOY
Sounds like they’re bad pennies.

SLASHER
Indeed.	And let’s just say they
sound, um, excited.

GIBSON
Might be our wand.	Let’s go.
Maybe we can have a gunfight with

some real players for once.

She takes off fast...

SLASHER
What’s our limit here, Gibson?

Gibson just stares at him.	Cowboy smirks as he pulls a
grenade out of his pack and cuts off its safety tape...


EXT.	SOUTH LA - USED CAR LOT - NIGHT

A bright oasis in the darkness. With lots of good deals. Ward and Jakoby settle down behind a row of minivans. Tikka stands guard. Jakoby and Ward are hurting, exhausted, raw. Jakoby regards the giant blood red full moon rising...

JAKOBY
That kid, man.	The Orc kid I let
go.

WARD
The one who was gonna shoot me in
the head and throw me in a pit?

Great kid.

JAKOBY
Listen to me. Listen. He was there. What are the odds of that? What are the fucking odds?
 
78.


WARD
Sure, it was a little unexpected.

JAKOBY
No.	It was impossible, Scott.

Jakoby fishes a smashed candy bar from his pocket. Shares half with Ward.

JAKOBY (CONT’D)
This is a prophecy.	We’re living
prophecy right now.	We’re just
little people man, people they
don’t write about.	But tonight’s
like the old days of the Heroes.

Like Jirak doing epic shit.

WARD
Just stay awake, keep talking.

A cop car with LIGHTS AND SIRENS blows blindly past the lot.

JAKOBY
Jirak was unblooded. Like me. He was just a farmer. But when he found out the Dark Lord was going to destroy the World. He raised a sword against him and led an army.

WARD
Homeboy earned his baller status.

Tikka cocks her head SEES SHADOWS among the vehicles...

JAKOBY
Before the deed is the word. A farmer was called by prophesy and united the Nine Races against the Dark Lord. He turned the Orcs from evil and they all raised their blades to him. He was blooded right there. Fulfilling the Great Prophecy.
(beat)
That’s what we’re in, a prophecy.
This all means something.	It’s

important.

Ward is losing faith in the world.	He looks at Jakoby.

WARD
It’s not prophecy, bro. It’s just one bad fuckin’ night and it’s almost over.
 
79.


Tikka spins on them, scared, eyes like saucers...

TIKKA
(subtitled)

She’s coming.	She’s coming.

Ward hauls Jakoby to his feet.

WARD
Lunchbreak’s over.	We’re moving.

A WHISTLE behind them.	They freeze.	Turn.	It’s Poison!

POISON
Hey.

Ward and Jakoby look around -- Altamira Veteranos have taken up positions all around the car lot. They’re surrounded and unarmed. It’s over.

POISON (CONT’D)
My pops bought lottery tickets every week. Wanted to get us out of the hood. To put us through college. His number never hit. Dude dropped dead mowing someone else’s fucking lawn. So I learned you only bet on sure things. The wand’s a sure thing.

A long, empty beat.	You can feel the sweat in the air.

WARD
My old man was a fucking underwater welder and drowned. You don’t see me shitting on the world and blaming The Man so I can get mine.

POISON
Fuck you. Here’s what’s up. Elf girl gets a pass to grow up and do whatever she’s gonna do with her life. But you two putos are dead. And I get the wand. Because dreams do come true. My dreams.

Jakoby stares at Ward, Ward stares at Jakoby. Tikka steps forward and holds out the wand...

WARD
Tikka!	No!

Poison and his homies stare at the wand.	Victory.
 
80.


POISON
Is... Is that it?

THE LIGHTS FLICKER.	Several go out.	Tikka REACTS.

TIKKA
...no...no...no...

The wand starts glowing, shedding heat ripples -- We’ve seen this before...

POISON
Hey little homegirl.	Why’s that
shit glowing?

TIKKA
(subtitled)

She’s here.

Jakoby looks at Ward -- Shit!

POISON
Fuck this. We’re killing everyone right now.

...silence... Poison looks over to his men. SEES a splatter of blood here. A torn piece of flesh there. They’re all gone...

POISON (CONT’D)
What the f--

--THWICK! -- A pallid veiny hand RIPS HIS THROAT OUT! Poison falls facedown on the asphalt -- And there she is!

JAKOBY
What is that?	What is that?

WARD
...it’s a witch...

Yes it is. The owner of the wand has returned for her property and she is TERRIFYING -- Greasy black hair falls around a sickly white face, tremendously old and misshapen, forced onto a young, lithe body. She bears a shotgun wound from her initial fight at the house.

A weird, long beat. It’s not even clear if the witch is aware of them. Her body sways gently in the night breeze.

JAKOBY
Scott?	Are we about to die, bro?

Ward exhales shakily.
 
81.


WARD
If that’s what it takes. You with me?

SCHWACK! -- Snaps out his collapsible baton and grins. His tired eyes burn with madness...

WARD (CONT’D)
We’re arresting this bitch.

Jakoby stares at him.	Then understands.	It’s the only move.
They’re still cops.	And they’ll die with their boots on.

SCHWACK! -- Jakoby snaps out his baton. They trade determined nods. Although barely able to stand, they square off against the Witch...

WARD (CONT’D)
LAPD. Turn the fuck around and get on your knees. Put your hands behind your head and interlace your fingers.

The Witch HISSES exposing black gums.

JAKOBY
She seems noncompliant.

WARD
I’m getting that too.

The Witch HISSES AGAIN. The two brave cops raise their batons to strike...

Tikka steps between them and raises the wand...

TIKKA
(screaming)

TALIOS!

BLUE FIRE ERUPTS FROM THE WAND TOWARDS THE WITCH! She swats it away like a tennis ball and makes a yanking motion...

Pulling her wand towards her, jerking Tikka towards the Witch. Jakoby and Ward grab Tikka...

WARD
The wand!	Get the wand!

Both men grab for the wand with frantic hands. Jakoby gets his hands around it just as Tikka loses her grip and falls to the side...
 
82.


JAKOBY
I got it I got it!

Ward gets a hand on it too. Now the two of them go for a ride, as if pulled by a tractor...

WARD
She gets it we’re dead!

They hold on for life. Their boots sliding over the pavement. An insane game of tug of war. Blood drips down Ward’s gunshot arm. Jakoby’s battered body creaks. He GROANS in pain...

Their hands wrapped tightly around the wand -- The wand cutting into their palms, blood leaks out over their knuckles...

WARD (CONT’D)
Bro, don’t let go. We go and we’re dead!

Jakoby ROARS like a lion at the Witch, blood streaming down his face...

The Witch laughs as she drags them closer and closer. FUCK! THEY ARE FUCKED! Ward slides a hand towards his gunbelt. Pivots his tazer in its holster...

BAM! -- Fires blind from the hip -- Tazer darts hit the witch in the neck. Her body goes RIGID as the tazer pumps high voltage into her...

She releases the wand from her spell -- Ward and Jakoby tumble backwards to the ground in a jumble. Jakoby finds himself staring at Poison’s dropped machine gun -- “Yes!”

Jakoby grabs the ugly black weapon and comes up firing...

BRDDDDDT! -- His shots go wide, shredding cars. CAR ALARMS scream out in the night...

WARD (CONT’D)
KILL HER NICK KILL HER!

Jakoby aiming carefully -- BRDDDDDT! -- Slugs smash into the Witch. Splattering black blood in all directions! The Witch drops. Jakoby out of ammo...

Now the Witch slowly stands.	HOLY SHIT SHE’S STILL ALIVE!
She SHRIEKS and summons her wand!

JAKOBY
The wand, the wand!
 
83.


Ward, on the ground, is brutally dragged across the pavement towards her. Metal on his belt throwing sparks...

Jakoby thinks fast. He grabs a heavy steel truck rim from a pile of tires. Hurls it with all his heart and might...

ON THE WITCH -- Grinning with evil delight -- Here comes her prize, her wand. She’s winning...

K-TANG! -- The rim crushes her head against an old truck with a burst of black goo. She drops lifeless...

The wand instantly goes slack to Ward’s relief. Jakoby falls against a car. Slumped there in a symphony of car alarms.

WARD
Good looking out, partner.

They reach out pathetically to bump fists and give up. Ward flops over. His uniform torn, road-rash over half his body. He lifts the wand in his hand, stares at it, then looks over to the dead witch, then to Jakoby...

WARD (CONT’D)
Where’s Tikka?

Jakoby and Ward look around -- THEY REALIZE TIKKA IS GONE!

JAKOBY
Why would she run? Where would she go?

WARD
She’s just a kid.	Only one place
she’d go.

Ward pulls himself up against a car, wincing...

WARD (CONT’D)
She’s going home, Nick.

The silence hangs.	Jakoby speaks quietly.

JAKOBY
We could leave. The binding spell’s off the wand right? ‘Cause the witch is dead? We can’t run and can’t hide. Consequences or not, we gotta get to a hospital, man. And get out of this fucking neighborhood.

WARD
Yeah.	But we’re not gonna.
 
84.


Ward spits blood, wipes his drawn, pallid face.

WARD (CONT’D)
My dad ran out on me. And Sophia’s dad ran out on her. Everywhere you look it’s people giving up and running away.
(beat)
Someone’s gotta do it.	Someone’s
gotta be the good guy.

A long pause. Then Jakoby nods. He’s in. Both men haul themselves to their feet. One last time...


EXT.	SOUTH LA - 341 ABRAMS - NIGHT

It’s quiet.	Dead quiet...

CAMERA SLOWLY REVEALS -- A dead SWAT COP. Then another. And another. And another. All the SWAT Cops are dead, shot to pieces. All killed in a vicious gunfight.

CAMERA FINDS BROWN -- Crawling to his car, dying from gunshots. He SEES two figures approaching. Ward and Jakoby emerge from the night mist like zombies...

BROWN
...not you assholes...

He tries to draw his pistol. Ward easily takes it away. Now Jakoby and Ward watch in total silence as Brown dies.

THEN A NOISE FROM THE HOUSE -- Ward nods for Jakoby to pick up a SWAT shotgun. He does. Ward and Jakoby approach the house. Limping up the porch stairs, Ward motions for Jakoby to go around the side...

As Jakoby slips along the side, WE SEE something he doesn’t:

Slasher, holding a rifle, watching him from the shadows...


INT.	341 ABRAMS - NIGHT (SAME TIME)

Ward moves very slowly, clearing the house. Now in the living room -- There’s Cowboy dead in a pool of blood...

A NOISE from the kitchen.	Ward heads toward it...

NEW ANGLE -- Gibson standing there breathing softly. Hidden by a bookcase. She’s looking at Cowboy. Who looks back. He’s not dead. Despite heavy injuries, he rises to his feet.
 
85.


Together they close in on Ward...


EXT.	SOUTH LA - 341 ABRAMS - NIGHT (SAME TIME)

Jakoby moves toward the back yard.	Quiet deliberate steps.
Slasher starting to follow...


INT.	341 ABRAMS - NIGHT (SAME TIME)

FROM A LOW ANGLE -- We watch Ward enter the kitchen...

REVERSE -- Tikka’s curled up under the sink, hidden by soup pots. She waves gently. Trying to get Ward’s attention. He doesn’t see her...

ON GIBSON -- Moving almost spectrally as she glides forward.
Trying to get an angle on Ward...

CLOSE ON WARD -- He can’t see her. But he pauses. Biting his lip. Maybe he feels a change in air pressure or something. Ward suddenly spins around -- Cowboy is right there!

POP-POP! -- Ward hits Cowboy in the face. Dropping him. Now Ward spots Gibson! But she has the drop on him. Her carbine aimed at his face...

But Ward has skills -- He jukes, spins and fires -- POP-POP!

BAM! -- GIBSON FIRES AT THE SAME TIME

Ward is hit in the chest. Gibson once in the face. Both of them fall. Tikka SCREAMS and bursts from her hiding place with a CLATTER of pots...

BAM! -- Gibson shoots Tikka in the back! -- Sending her spinning into the cupboards...

WARD
Nooooo!

Tikka writhes in pain on the linoleum -- Ward raises his gun at Gibson. And hesitates...

Because Gibson has her carbine trained on Tikka...

GIBSON
Don’t.

Jakoby appears in the big hole in the wall -- Shotgun aimed at Gibson...
 
86.


WARD
Wait wait wait!	Nick wait!

Jakoby SEES the jeopardy that Tikka is in. Sees the state of Ward, he’s bad. Real bad. Gibson slowly pushing herself to her feet, keeping her gun on Tikka...

JAKOBY
She just shot a kid Scott.

WARD
Yeah.	And she’ll do it again.

Gibson SEES Slasher sneak past the kitchen window, moving to flank Jakoby. Her eyes flick to Ward...

GIBSON
Drop your weapon.

No way Ward will do that. Gibson looks at Tikka, finger on the trigger...

GIBSON (CONT’D)
This trigger has a four pound
break.	Maybe you’ll destroy my
brain stem with a perfect shot.

But the girl will still die.

Ward glares at her -- She’s being covered by Jakoby -- So he tosses his gun away...

JAKOBY
Bro.	Don’t.	Shit.

GIBSON
Get up.	Go to the table.

Ward, in excruciating pain, plants his feet and drives himself slowly up the wall...

WARD
You’re crazy.	You’re a fucking
animal.

Jakoby staring down his sights at Gibson.	Hyper focused.

GIBSON
Please.	Sit down.	Take a moment
to think about what you’re doing.

Ward staggers to the table, slowly sinks into a chair.

GIBSON (CONT’D)
Where is the wand?
 
87.


WARD
What the fuck are you?

GIBSON
(after a long beat)

I represent a larger interest. One that watches. And waits. For opportunities and capitalizes on them. The wand is an opportunity.
(beat)
You’re going to give me the wand.

WARD
And then what?

GIBSON
I’m going to kill you and your orc friend. I’m going to walk out of this house. I’m going to work out and train and wait for my next assignment.

WARD
Right.

Suddenly they hear a storm of TRUCK ENGINES AND SCREECHING TIRES out front...


EXT.	SOUTH LA - 341 ABRAMS - NIGHT (SAME TIME)

SIX BLACK SUVs swarm the property. Kandomere and Gordon Vance pop out with a dozen hi-tech SPECIAL OPERATORS, everyone armored and tooled up for a firefight...

Kandomere regards the house a beat.	His eyes go wide.

KANDOMERE
There’s a bright in the house.

GORDON VANCE
You sure?	How do you know?

KANDOMERE
Have I been wrong yet?

Vance turns to his men as they form assault teams...

GORDON VANCE
It’s confirmed a bright’s in there.

Kill everything that moves.

An Assault Team heads for the back of the house.
 
88.


INT.	341 ABRAMS - KITCHEN - NIGHT (SAME TIME)

Ward heard them.	Gibson heard them...

WARD
So ... do you have a new plan?

Gibson doesn’t waver. Tikka moaning in pain on the floor. Ward slides a hand towards the pocket on his thigh where the wand is stashed...

WARD (CONT’D)
The second she lowers that gun even an inch you kill her Nick.

JAKOBY
Roger that, partner.

Gibson regards Jakoby. Looks back at Ward. SEES Ward now holds the wand...

GIBSON
Interesting.	Now put it down.

WARD
No.

GIBSON
You’re either born a bright or you study for years. Are you a bright? No. Do you know any spells? No. Try to use that wand and it will

kill you.

WARD
Shut up.

GIBSON
There’s no way out. Give me the wand while this little creature is still breathing.

WARD
Nick.	Get Tikka out of here.

GIBSON
No, Orc.	You don’t move.

Jakoby, still aiming his gun at Gibson, slowly moves into the kitchen, towards Tikka...

GIBSON (CONT’D)
Don’t move another fucking inch.
 
89.


Jakoby stops.	The shotgun shakes in his hands...

WARD
Nick.	It’s okay.	Get Tikka.

JAKOBY
What are you doing, Scott?

WARD
It’s gonna be okay.

GIBSON
Listen to your Orc.

JAKOBY
What are you doing?

Ward smiles at his friend.	Quietly...

WARD
It’s like you said.	It’s a
prophecy.	It’s all a prophecy.

JAKOBY
You really believe that?

WARD
No.	So I need you to believe it
for me.
(then)

Get Tikka out of here.

GIBSON
You’ll do no such thing.
(to Ward)

Imagine sitting in front of a candle day and night for years. Learning the stillness of mind a wand requires. Years of repeating the same spells. Precise articulations of ancient word forms.

Tikka, looking at Gibson, realizes something. At the same time Ward does...

WARD
...you’re a bright...

NEW ANGLE -- Slasher steps through the hole into the kitchen.
Weapon trained on Jakoby.	Softly whispers...
 
90.


SLASHER
Easy friend.	I got the drop on
you.	Let’s not have any mistakes
here.	I need you to slowly lower
your weapon.

Jakoby knows he fucked up...

JAKOBY
What do I do?

WARD
Don’t you dare lower that shotgun.

Gibson takes a step towards Ward...

WARD (CONT’D)
Stop.

JAKOBY
...Scott..?


EXT.	SOUTH LA - 341 ABRAMS - BACK YARD - NIGHT (SAME TIME)

The Assault Team creeps up -- THEY SEE Slasher in the kitchen through the hole in the wall...


INT.	341 ABRAMS - KITCHEN - NIGHT (SAME TIME)

Gibson’s eyes bore in on Ward...

GIBSON
It’s over.	It’s hopeless.

WARD
SHUT THE FUCK UP!

NOW.	EVERYTHING.	HAPPENS.	AT.	ONCE...

POP-POP! -- Slasher is shot in the back by the Assaulters...

Jakoby fires his shotgun at Gibson -- KABOOM!

...just as Slasher falls onto him, knocking his aim askew...

...so he only blows out a chunk of wall by Gibson’s head.
Who swings her carbine from Tikka to Ward...

WARD SPRINGS TO HIS FEET AND SCREAMS:

WARD (CONT’D)
 
TALIOS!
 
91.


THE FUCKING ROOM EXPLODES INTO LIGHT. The wand BLOWS APART INTO A FOUNTAIN OF FIRE, VIOLENTLY LAUNCHING WARD BACKWARDS INTO THE WALL...

A LIQUID INFERNO OF LIGHT splashing in all directions.

BLOWING APART GIBSON INTO A SCREAMING FLAMING SKELETON!


EXT.	341 ABRAMS - NIGHT (SAME TIME)

LIGHT AND FIRE EXPLODE OUT THE WINDOWS -- Vance and the other operators dive to the ground.

ON KANDOMERE -- He doesn’t flinch. Even as the shockwave blows back his clothes...


INT.	341 ABRAMS - KITCHEN - NIGHT (SAME TIME)

THE KITCHEN LOOKS LIKE LITERAL HELL -- Everything engulfed in fire...

Jakoby sees Slasher is still alive.	Taking aim at him.
Jakoby fires -- Buckshot knocks Slasher into the flames.

JAKOBY
Scott!	Scott where are you!?

Nothing. He SEES Tikka unconscious on the floor. Jakoby lifts her, he staggers to the front door...


EXT.	SOUTH LA - 341 ABRAMS - NIGHT (SAME TIME)

Jakoby stumbles out of the house with Tikka in his arms. Towards a jittery firing squad of Special Operators!

GORDON VANCE
ORC!

BRDDDDT! -- Gordon opens fire, Kandomere with his Elvin reflexes shoves his gun down just in time...

Jakoby stumbles and drops to his knees...

KANDOMERE
Help the child!

Jakoby is surrounded. Tikka is immediately taken away from him, rushed to the PARAMEDICS. FIRE ENGINES arrive...

Jakoby is clearly dazed, barely able to stand, but he manages to get up -- He’s headed back towards the house...
 
92.


Across the street -- The intimidating Orcs of the Fogteeth Gang have gathered to watch...

Kandomere blocks Jakoby’s path...

KANDOMERE (CONT’D)
Stop.	We got you.	It’s safe now.

JAKOBY
You don’t understand, there’s a
prophecy.	This is part of

something bigger...

KANDOMERE
Calm down. I know it’s something bigger. But you need to calm down.

The house is now a complete inferno -- And Jakoby is willing to walk right back in. Kandomere won’t allow that...

Jakoby looks around, dazed. PEOPLE have finally come out of their homes. Now liberated from the predations of the Altamira Gang. Sensing something special has happened...

JAKOBY
Please listen, listen to me.	He
saved me and the girl, you can’t

just let him burn.

Gordon Vance helps out...

GORDON VANCE
Sir, you need you need medical

help.

JAKOBY
He’s my best friend! My best friend, let me in there! Scott! Hey Scott! That’s my best friend!

Jakoby collapses. Kandomere and Vance trying to keep him seated. Quietly now:

JAKOBY (CONT’D)
... my best friend.	Please.
That’s my best friend....

KANDOMERE
It’s over.	You have to accept it.
It’s over.

Jakoby stares at the house and shudders in anguish.
Heartbroken.	Tears roll down his face...
 
93.


KANDOMERE (CONT’D)
Breathe.	You need to breathe.

JAKOBY
You’re an elf you can hear in there. Tell me he’s dead. Tell me he’s really dead.

Kandomere turns and looks back at the house, focusing. Then falters. And Jakoby sees it...

JAKOBY (CONT’D)
What did you hear?

KANDOMERE
He’s dead.

Jakoby stares at him, searching his face.	Then:

JAKOBY
You’re lying!

Tapping into some reserve of incredible strength, Jakoby shoves Kandomere off him! He’s up and stumbling into the burning house before anyone can stop him -- Kandomere can only watch. So brave. So pointless...


INT. 341 ABRAMS - NIGHT (SAME TIME)

Jakoby enters, coughing, choking on dense smoke. EVERYTHING BURNS. The ceiling falling around him. Glass breaking...

He searches fruitlessly for Ward -- EVERYTHING IS JUST FIRE. Too disorienting and bright. He’s being cooked alive!

A SECTION OF WALL COLLAPSES -- Revealing Ward curled up in a corner. Jakoby staggers to him, throws an arm around, hefts him over his shoulder...


EXT.	SOUTH LA - 341 ABRAMS - NIGHT (SAME TIME)

Jakoby and Ward COME CRASHING out the window, slamming into the ground as fire erupts from the doors and windows!

The CROWD GASPS -- Now yelling and cheering...

Jakoby drags Ward across the yard. Finally collapsing next to him. Ward looks ... dead.

JAKOBY
You’re out, you’re out of there, I got you. I got you. You’re okay..

(MORE)
 
94.

JAKOBY (CONT'D)
Be okay.	Just be okay.	Breathe.
Please breathe!	C’mon Scott say
something, say...

Ward’s eyes are fixed in the distance, past Jakoby. Ward weakly points...

WARD
... Nick ... look ...

Jakoby does. And SEES the Fogteeth Orcs standing behind police lines. He just stares at them, uncomprehending...

Then Dorghu steps forward and draws his ceremonial dagger. He cuts his own paw and raises his clawed hand high. Then all the Orcs behind him raise their hands too...

Jakoby watching this -- HE’S BEEN BLOODED -- Overcome with emotion, he starts to cry...

JAKOBY
Hey, Scott, we’re gonna be okay.

Everything’s ... Scott?

Ward is done.

FADE TO WHITE

CLOSE ON SOMETHING BROWN -- Unclear what. A vortex of some kind. A spiral. WE SLOWLY REALIZE IT’S HAIR. We’re in a POV shot of someone’s hair. There’s FAINT BEEPING...


INT.	HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

Ward is in a hospital bed with someone else’s hair next to his face. It’s SOPHIA! She’s crawled into the hospital bed with him. She’s asleep.

Ward is heavily bandaged, pale, hooked up to machines. Everything’s blurry and confusing. He looks down at Sophia and buries his face in her hair, tears streaming down his face. He didn’t believe he’d get this moment...

Sophia hugs a piece of paper. Ward reaches for it. Slides it out of her arms. Looks at it. Chokes with emotion...

It’s her crayon drawing of Ward and Jakoby...

An ELVEN NURSE enters. Checks numbers on machines. SEES He’s conscious. Checks his pulse. All business...

WARD
...where’s my partner..?
 
95.


ELVEN NURSE
Please don’t talk.

WARD
...where is he..?

She SNICKS back the curtain between the beds...

REVEALING JAKOBY in the adjacent bed -- Equally beat to hell.
Ward smiles...

Jakoby looks over at him. His broken face smiles back. They try to bump fists -- CLACK-CLANG -- They’re handcuffed to their beds! Now Ward SEES the FEDERAL MARSHALS in SWAT gear guarding them...

WARD (CONT’D)
How fucked are we?

Jakoby just shakes his head gravely -- It’s really bad...


INT.	HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY

Outside their room Kandomere talks to a Marshall. He gets a call and steps aside to take it...

KANDOMERE
Any luck?

INTERCUT:


INT.	COMPUTER FORENSICS LAB - DAY

Three TECHNICIANS cluster around a monitor. The Drive from the Surveillance Van on their table...

TECHNICIAN
We got something. Not much but we got something.

KANDOMERE
How much is something?

TECHNICIAN
Thirty three seconds.

KANDOMERE
What value is thirty three seconds?

TECHNICIAN
You’d be surprised.
 
96.


He pushes play and holds the phone to the speaker as video from INSIDE THE KITCHEN AT 341 ABRAMS plays...

POLLARD
... the Department knows fuck all about the wand. If they did the whole world would be here. The wand doesn’t exist. The wand was never here. We’re taking the wand.

Kandomere listening to the rest.	Amazed...


INT.	HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

Kandomere enters. Looks at the Jakoby and Ward. At these two incredible brave men. He’s proud to know them...

Kandomere unlocks Ward’s cuffs. Then frees Jakoby. The Marshall’s see that...

US MARSHALL
Whoa.	What the hell are you doing?
Those guys are cop killers.

KANDOMERE
No. They’re not. They’re the good guys.

Ward and Jakoby trade looks. Not fully understanding, but they know everything will somehow be okay. They reach out to each other and shake...

SLAM TO BLACK.


INT.	SHRINE - NIGHT

Tikka sits staring at a candle. Reciting magical incantations -- Training for what’s to come...
