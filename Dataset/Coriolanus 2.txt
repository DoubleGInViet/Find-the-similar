EXT. SENATE - DAY

The Roman Senate is constructed with classical symmetry and clean, square lines. Probably the most striking and
beautiful
building in Rome.

INT. SENATE-CORRIDOR - DAY

Volumnia, Virgilia and Menenius are hurrying down a
corridor,

excited. All are well-dressed, for an important public
event.











30.

VOLUMNIA

Honorable Menenius, my boy Martius approaches! For the love of Juno, let's go.

MENENIUS

Is he not wounded? He was wont to come home wounded.
 
VIRGILIA

0, no, no, no...

VOLUMNIA

(VICTORIOUSLY)

0, he is wounded! I thank the gods for it.

MENENIUS

So do I too -- if it be not too much. Brings a victory in his pocket, the wounds become him. Has he disciplined Aufidius soundly?

VOLUMNIA

Titus Lartius says they fought together, but Aufidius got off.

VIRGILIA

In truth, there's wondrous things spoke of him. Gods grant them true.

VOLUMNIA

(an exhalation of scorn)
True?!

MENENIUS

I'll be sworn they are true. Where is he wounded?

Volumnia and Menenius now gleefully add up her son's wounds like accountants -- or campaign managers.

VOLUMNIA

In the shoulder and in the left arm. There will be large scars to show the people, when he shall stand for his place He received in the repulse of Tarquin seven hurts in the body.

MENENIUS

One in the neck, and two in the thigh - there's nine that I know.
 
31

VOLUMNIA

He had, before this last expedition, twenty-five wounds upon him.

MENENIUS

Now it's twenty-seven. Every gash was an enemy's grave.
We focus on Volumnia's face as she thinks about her son.

VOLUMNIA

BEFORE HIM

He carries noise, and behind him he

leaves tears.
Death, that dark spirit, in his nervy arm

DOTH LIE;

Which, being advanced, declines, and then men die.

They hurry to the stop of a grand staircase, where there are people waiting...

INT. SENATE-STAIRS - DAY

They join Cominius and other dignitaries at the top of a majestic stairway.

An honor guard of Roman soldiers in dress uniforms are waiting. Roman flags flutter. All very ceremonial. Martius enters below. The honor guard snaps to attention. Martius -- hereafter called Coriolanus -- slowly begins to cross to the steps. We see that walking is very difficult for him. His wounds are severe and every movement is agony. He has paid a steep price for his victory.

Photographers flash photos and a TV crew film the ceremony. Coriolanus finally reaches the steps leading up. He takes a breath and slowly begins to climb the stairs, each step a challenge.

Volumnia looks down on him. Unmoved by his pain.
Virgilia is distraught.

As Coriolanus slowly hauls himself up the last few steps, General Cominius speaks into a cluster of microphones and addresses the press:
 

32.

COMINIUS
Be it known,
As to us, to all the world, that Caius

MARTIUS

Wears this war's garland And from
this time,

For what he did before Corioles, call him,

With all the applause and clamor of the host,
"Caius Martius Coriolanus!"

(TO MARTIUS)

Bear the addition nobly ever!
The soldiers salute in a grim sort of chant:

SOLDIERS

Caius Martius Coriolanus!

Coriolanus has reached the podium. An awkward beat. Cominius gestures for him to speak into the microphones. He tersely does so:

CORIOLANUS

No more of this; it does offend my heart.
Pray now, no more.
An awkward silence. Cominius elegantly tries to covers the

MOMENT:

COMINIUS

Look, sir, your mother.

CORIOLANUS

0,

You have, I know, petitioned all the gods For my prosperity.
He kneels to her -- slowly, with great difficulty -- she

lets
him.

VOLUMNIA

Nay, my good soldier, up.
(he slowly rises)

My gentle Martius, worthy Caius, and By deed-achieving honor newly named - What is it? - Coriolanus must I call thee?
 
She laughs coquettishly, thoroughly upstaging her son.

Then, almost an afterthought:











33.

VOLUMNIA

But, 0, thy wife...

Coriolanus greets Virgilia with the clumsy and stiff formality that marks their marriage.

CORIOLANUS

My gracious silence, hail.

An awkwardly tender kiss. He notes her tears. Reacts coldly.

CORIOLANUS
Would thou have laughed had I come
coffined home,

That weeps to see me triumph? Ay, my dear,

Such eyes the widows in Corioles wear, And mothers that lack sons.

MENENIUS

Now, the gods crown thee!

CORIOLANUS

(greets him warmly)
And live you yet?

VOLUMNIA

(LAUGHS)

I know not where to turn. 0, welcome home!

And welcome, general. And you're welcome all!

MENENIUS

A hundred thousand welcomes!

Coriolanus is surrounded by well-wishers and political admirers. Volumnia and Menenius usher him along.

We see the image from TV: The noble warrior returned home.
Devoted family. Flags waving. The future golden.
 
INT. VILLA-BATHROOM - EVENING

And then the hard reality.

Coriolanus' body is a battleground of scars. Some are livid and red, fresh and still oozing blood. Others are pale and blue, discolored and dead.

His body is something monstrous. Stitched up. Patched together. Slashed around. Frankenstein's monster.











34.

He is leaning against a sink, stripped naked. His muscular
if
shattered body exposed.
Volumnia sits and dresses her son's wounds. As she always
has
done. As she always will.
It is a disturbing, intimate image.

CORIOLANUS

The good Senators must be visited;
From whom I have received not only
greetings,

But with them change of honors.

He shifts painfully as she continues to treat one of his wounds.

VOLUMNIA
I have lived
To see inherited my very wishes
And the buildings of my fancy. Only
There's one thing wanting, which I doubt

NOT BUT
Our Rome will cast upon thee.
He catches her eye in the mirror, very firm:

CORIOLANUS

Know, good mother,
I had rather be their servant in my way,
Than sway with them in theirs.
They stop when--
Virgilia enters.

She stops in the doorway. It is embarrassing for her, as if she has interrupted two lovers. A long moment.
 
She looks to her husband.

To Volumnia.
They stare back.
There is no way she can compete with their intimacy.
Surrendering, she silently goes.

INT. VILLA -- HALLWAY - EVENING

Virgilia wanders a long hallway, past a fine collection of antique Roman weaponry. She seems lost.











35.

She stops and opens a door, glances into her son's bedroom:
Young Martius is asleep.

Her eyes move across his room. The military toys. The little cadet uniform carefully hung. The polished boots waiting. All stern and joyless. Not like a child's room at all. Virgilia closes the door and continues down the long

hallway,
disappearing into darkness.

INT. SENATE-OFFICE - DAY

Darkened office. Brutus and Sicinius sit, heads together, focused.

SICINIUS
He cannot temperately transport his
honors, but will
Lose those he hath won.

BRUTUS

I heard him swear,
Were he to stand for Consul, never would

HE

Appear in the marketplace nor Showing, as the manner is, his wounds To the people, beg "their stinking breaths."

SICINIUS

It was his word.
 
INT. SENATE-CORRIDOR - DAY

Brutus and Sicinius continue as they hurry to the Senate

CHAMBER:

BRUTUS

So it must fall out with him,
Or our authorities at an end.

SICINIUS

We must suggest to the people in what

HATRED

He still hath held them.

BRUTUS

(SHUSHING HIM)

Peace...











36.

They enter the Senate Chamber...

INT. SENATE CHAMBER - DAY

Brutus and Sicinius make their way to their seats as we
hear:

MENENIUS (V.0.)

It remains,

As the main point of this our after-meeting,
To gratify his noble service that

Hath thus stood for his country...
The interior of the grand Senate is an airy, sweeping
chamber

that suggests the Israeli Knesset or U.N. General Assembly. Again, classical symmetry is the rule with tiers of seats facing a central dais. An imposing piece of outdated modern art suggesting the might of Rome looms over the chamber like a bird of prey.

Network TV cameras purr quietly from a corner.
Menenius, Cominius, Coriolanus and several other politicos
 

are seating at a central table on the dais, facing the rows of SENATORS.

Menenius is standing at a podium, speaking into a microphone:

MENENIUS

Therefore, please you,
Most reverend and grave elders, to desire
The present Consul, and last general
In our well-found successes, to report
A little of that worthy work performed
By Caius Martius Coriolanus.

SENATOR

Speak, good Cominius.

General Cominius rises and moves to the podium.
But then Coriolanus abruptly stands--

MENENIUS

Nay, keep your place.

SENATOR

Sit, Coriolanus. Never shame to hear
What you have nobly done.











37.

CORIOLANUS

Your honors' pardon.
I had rather have my wounds to heal again
Than hear say how I got them.

MENENIUS
Pray now, sit down.

CORIOLANUS

I had rather have one scratch my head in

THE SUN

When the alarum were struck than idly sit To hear my nothings monstered.

Coriolanus moves across the dais and exits into a hallway.
The door shuts after him.
Menenius sighs. Nods to Cominius.
 

Cominius moves to the podium and begins to read his speech from a Teleprompter. This all has the rehearsed quality of a campaign nomination speech.

COMINIUS

The deeds of Coriolanus
Should not be uttered feebly. It is held
That valor is the chiefest virtue, and
Most dignifies the haver. Alone he

ENTERED

The mortal gate of the city,
And struck Corioles like a planet,
From face to foot
He was a thing of blood...

Brutus and Sicinius exchange a glance, bored by the
political
boilerplate.

INT. SENATE-SERVICE CORRIDOR - DAY

Meanwhile, Coriolanus stands in the service corridor beyond the chamber. Green industrial walls. Ugly fluorescent lights above.

He leans against a wall, alone with his thoughts.
Cominius' voice can be heard droning inside.

Then Coriolanus glances up. A CUSTODIAN is pushing a garbage can down the long corridor. He stops when he sees
Coriolanus.

Coriolanus' cool, uncompromising stare makes the Custodian uneasy. He turns around and goes back.











38.
Coriolanus waits. His face strangely vacant.
He flexes his wounded arm. It hurts.

He hears Cominius finish. A good round of applause. He hears his name being cheered: "Coriolanus!"

Coriolanus closes his eyes, steels himself, and then re-enters the chamber...

INT. SENATE CHAMBER - DAY

Menenius greets him and escorts him to the podium for his "acceptance speech."
 

MENENIUS

The Senate, Coriolanus, are well pleased To make thee Consul! Menenius steps back.

A beat.
Coriolanus stares at the Senators. At the TV cameras.
He leans awkwardly into the podium microphone:

CORIOLANUS
I do owe them still
My life and services.
A beat.

For an acceptance speech, rather terse. Menenius jumps in to salvage the moment:

MENENIUS

It then remains
That you do speak to the people.

CORIOLANUS

I do beseech you,
Let me overleap that custom, for I cannot

ENTREAT THEM

For my wounds' sake to give their
suffrage.
Please you that I may pass this doing.
From the Senate floor, Sicinius jumps on this:

SICINIUS

Sir, the people
Must have their voices!











39.

The Senators, led by Brutus, clamor their agreement.
Tradition must be obeyed.

MENENIUS

(calming, to Coriolanus)
Pray you, go fit you to the custom.

CORIOLANUS

It is a part
 
That I shall blush in acting, and might

WELL

Be taken from the people.
Menenius quickly turns off Coriolanus' microphone.

BRUTUS

(TO SICINIUS)

Mark you that?

CORIOLANUS

To brag unto them "Thus I did, and thus!" Show them the unaching scars which I should hide,

As if I had received them for the hire Of their breath only!

Menenius sees Coriolanus is getting angry, this could be disastrous.

He elegantly gestures for Cominius to escort Coriolanus out immediately -- as he addresses the Senators and TV cameras:

MENENIUS
To our noble Consul
Wish we all joy and honor!

He applauds. The applause is taken up by the Senators. Some cheering as well for the hero of Rome The two Tribunes, however, are already whispering maliciously to other Senators.

Menenius seems pleased with the general response. So far, so good.

INT. VILLA -- LIVING ROOM - DAY

Volumnia is pleased as well.
She sits, watching the events unfold on TV.
The sound of the cheering fades as we go to...











40.

INT. MENENIUS' LIMO - DAY

The limousine winds through the pedestrian traffic toward
the
 
Roman marketplace.

Coriolanus sits with Menenius. Coriolanus is both angry and embarrassed. He is wearing a sharp business suit.

MENENIUS

Have you not known
The worthiest men have done it?

CORIOLANUS

(AGREES)

Custom calls me to it.

What custom wills, in all things should we do...
What must I say?

"Look, sir, my wounds.
I got them in my country's service."

MENENIUS

O me, the gods!
You must not speak like that. You must

DESIRE THEM
To think upon you--

CORIOLANUS

"Think upon me"? Hang 'em!
I would they would forget me.

MENENIUS

You'll mar all!

The limo stops. They are at the marketplace. The moment has come.
Menenius takes a breath. Urges calm:

MENENIUS

Pray you, speak to them, I pray you,
In wholesome manner.

CORIOLANUS

(SOURLY)

Bid them wash their faces
And keep their teeth clean.
He leaves the car.
 


41.

EXT. MARKETPLACE - DAY

The commercial heart of Rome. A large town square, since antiquity used as a marketplace.

But now it is filled with tatty stalls selling cheap purses and knock-off watches. Paltry fruit stands alongside shabby souvenir stalls.

Advertising billboards surround and pollute the square -- SONY. COKE. NIKE. MCDONALDS -- obscuring any classical architecture that might have survived.

Tamora and Cassius, the political activists, are in the crowd. They watch closely.

Coriolanus slowly walks to the center of the marketplace. He stands, feeling ridiculous and not at all humble. He looks around.

Waiting for something to happen.
The CUSTOMERS and SHOPKEEPERS just look back at him. Some
are

curious. Some are amused. Some hostile and most indifferent.
But no one approaches.

Then Coriolanus understands. He must g to them: beg for votes.
He prepares himself and then slowly moves through the
various

stalls, weaving in and out. Trying to maintain his dignity. He sees the Citizens from before and goes to them. We

glimpse
Brutus and Sicinius amongst the crowd.

CORIOLANUS

(TO CASSIUS)

You know the cause, sir, of my standing here.

CASSIUS

We do, sir. Tell us what hath brought you to it.

CORIOLANUS

Mine own desert.

TAMORA

Your own desert?

CORIOLANUS

Ay, but not mine own desire.
 









42.

TAMORA

How not your own desire?

CORIOLANUS

No, it was never my desire yet to trouble the poor with begging.

CASSIUS

You must think, if we give you anything, we hope to gain by you.

CORIOLANUS

Well then, I pray, your price of the
Consulship?

WAR VET

The price is to ask it kindly.

CORIOLANUS

Kindly, sir, I pray, let me have it. I have wounds to show you, which shall be yours in private Your good voice, sir. What say you?

WAR VET

(IMPRESSED)

You shall have it, worthy sir.

CORIOLANUS

A match, sir. There's in all two worthy voices begged. I have your alms. Adieu.

Business done, so he thinks, Coriolanus crisply moves on.
Cassius is not convinced.

CASSIUS

But this is something odd.

Coriolanus continues on. He sees a large JAMAICAN WOMAN with her CHILDREN, carrying plastic grocery bags, talking to a SHOPKEEPER. He goes to them:

CORIOLANUS
 

Pray you now, if it may stand with the tune of your voices that I may be Consul.

JAMAICAN WOMAN

You have deserved nobly of your country, and you have not deserved nobly.

CORIOLANUS

Your enigma?











43.

JAMAICAN WOMAN

You have been a scourge to her enemies; you have been a rod to her friends You have not indeed loved the common people.

CORIOLANUS

You should account me the more virtuous that I have not been common in my love Therefore, beseech you, I may be Consul.

SHOPKEEPER

We hope to find you our friend, and therefore give you our voices heartily.

JAMAICAN WOMAN

You have received many wounds for your country.

CORIOLANUS

I will not seal your knowledge with showing them. I will make much of your voices, and so trouble you no farther.

JAMAICAN WOMAN

The gods give you joy, sir, heartily!

Coriolanus is warming to the task, it's easier than he thought. He moves to a central, open area and declares

PUBLICLY:
 
CORIOLANUS

Your voices! For your voices I have

FOUGHT;
Watched for your voices; for your voices

BEAR

Of wounds two dozen odd; battles thrice

SIX
I have seen and heard of!

A crowd is gathering. We note Brutus and Sicinius in the crowd. Menenius, too, has moved in.

CORIOLANUS

For your voices

Have done many things, some less, some more.
Your voices! Indeed, I would be Consul.

WAR VET

He has done nobly, and cannot go without any honest man's voice!











44.

RACE TRACK TOUT
Therefore let him be Consul!

JAMAICAN WOMAN

The gods give him joy, and make him good friend to the people!
The Citizens applaud and give their support:

CITIZENS

Amen, amen. God save thee, noble Consul!

CORIOLANUS

Worthy voices!
Menenius, with Brutus and Sicinius, goes to him:

MENENIUS

You have stood your limitation, and the
 
TRIBUNES

Endue you with the people's voice.

CORIOLANUS
Is this done?

SICINIUS

The custom of request you have
discharged.

The people do admit you, and are summoned To meet anon upon your approbation.

CORIOLANUS

Where? At the Senate?

SICINIUS
There, Coriolanus.

MENENIUS

I'll keep you company.

(TO BRUTUS)

Will you along?

BRUTUS

(DECLINES)

We stay here for the people.

Coriolanus and Menenius go, relieved the trial is over. Brutus and Sicinius, however, have work to do. This has not gone as they wanted. They are urgent:

SICINIUS

How now, my masters! Have you chose this man?











45.

CASSIUS

(RUEFULLY)

He has our voices, sir.

BRUTUS
 

We pray the gods he may deserve your loves.

TAMORA

Amen, sir. To my poor unworthy notice, He mocked us when he begged our voices.

CASSIUS

CERTAINLY

He flouted us downright.

JAMAICAN WOMAN

No, it is his kind of speech; he did not mock us.

TAMORA

(SHARPLY)

He should have showed us

His marks of merit, wounds received for's country.

SICINIUS

Why, so he did, I am sure.

TAMORA

No, no! No one saw them!

CASSIUS

(inciting the crowd)
Was not this mockery?
Brutus presses hard:

BRUTUS
When he had no power,

But was a petty servant to the state, He was your enemy, ever spake against Your liberties.

SICINIUS
Did you perceive

He did solicit you in free contempt When he did need your loves, and do you

THINK

That his contempt shall not be bruising

TO YOU

When he hath power to crush?
 








46.

Cassius and Tamora carefully lead the crowd in expressing growing alarm and resistance to Coriolanus:

CASSIUS

He's not confirmed; we may deny him yet!

TAMORA

And will deny him!

I'll have five hundred voices of that sound.

CASSIUS

I twice five hundred and their friends!
The crowd roars approval. A frightening, animal sound.

SICINIUS

Let them assemble,
And on a safer judgment all revoke
Your ignorant election.

BRUTUS
Enforce his pride,
And his old hate unto you!

SICINIUS

And presently, when you have drawn your number,
Repair to the Capitol.

CASSIUS

We will so!

TAMORA
We will so! All
Repent in their election!

Cassius and Tamora lead the crowd. It is a terrifying spectacle of sudden mob rage, only a razor-thin edge to violence.

Brutus and Sicinius watch, satisfied, like Robespierre and Saint Just looking over the bloody guillotine.

INT. SENATE-CORRIDOR - DAY

Coriolanus, dressed again in his familiar uniform, emerges
 
from an antechamber with his comrade Titus.

Menenius, General Cominius and several pro-Coriolanus Senators follow them. They stride down the corridor.











47.

CORIOLANUS

(TO TITUS)

Tullus Aufidius then has assembled a new army?

TITUS

He has, my lord.

CORIOLANUS

Saw you Aufidius?

TITUS

He is retired to Antium.

CORIOLANUS

Spoke he of me?

TITUS

He did, my lord.

CORIOLANUS

How? What?

TITUS

How often he had met you, sword to sword; That of all things upon the earth he

HATED

Your person most.

CORIOLANUS

At Antium lives he?

TITUS

At Antium.

CORIOLANUS
 

I wish I had a cause to seek him there, To oppose his hatred fully.

They hear the growing rumble of a crowd. Curious.
They continue on and turn a corner to...

INT. SENATE-CENTRAL LOBBY - DAY

The central lobby of the Senate is an open, airy space. Through the glass doors at the front of the lobby an unruly crowd can be seen gathering. Police. Barricades. Sicinius and Brutus are waiting to intercept them.











48.

CORIOLANUS

(TO TITUS)

Behold, these are the Tribunes of the people,
The tongues of the common mouth.

SICINIUS

Pass no further.

CORIOLANUS

Ha! What is that?

BRUTUS

It will be dangerous to go on. No
further.

CORIOLANUS

What makes this change?

MENENIUS

The matter?

COMINIUS

Hath he not passed the nobles and the commons?

BRUTUS

Cominius, no.

Coriolanus steps closer to Brutus. The mob sees him through
 
the glass doors. The tension immediately increases.

CORIOLANUS

Have I had children's voices?

TITUS

Tribunes, give way.

BRUTUS

The people are incensed against him.

CORIOLANUS

(glancing to the growing

CROWD)

Are these your herd?

MENENIUS

Be calm, be calm.

BRUTUS

The people cry you mocked them, and of
late called them
Time-pleasers, flatterers, foes to
nobleness.











49.

CORIOLANUS

But this was known before.

SICINIUS

You show too much of that
For which the people stir. If you will

PASS

To where you are bound, you must inquire your way.

The crowd outside is growing restless, sensing and responding

to the building tension. The police try to hold them back, keeping them away from the doors. The crowd presses in.

We see Cassius and Tamora at the forefront, urging the crowd on.
 

MENENIUS

Let's be calm--

COMINIUS

The people are abused, set on--

MENENIUS

Not now, not now--

TITUS

Not in this heat, sir--

Coriolanus strides angrily toward the doors and exits-- The others follow--

EXT. SENATE-COURTYARD - DAY

Coriolanus launches himself into the crowd with blistering

ANGER:

CORIOLANUS

My nobler friends, I crave their pardons. For the mutable, rank-scented crowd, Let them regard me as I do not flatter, And therein behold themselves. I say again,

In soothing them, we nourish against our

SENATE

The cockle of rebellion, insolence,
sedition,

Which we ourselves have ploughed for, sowed, and scattered,
By mingling them with us!











50.

MENENIUS

Well, no more!

TITUS

No more words, we beseech you--
The mob has surrounded them all by now.
 

The police are getting nervous, eyes darting uneasily from the unruly crowd to the volatile men.

This all has the potential of sparking to violence.

We note a TV news crew moving into position, covering the action. Others film with cell phone cameras. We intercut

some
of this footage.

BRUTUS

(to Coriolanus, provoking)
You speak of the people
As if you were a god to punish, not
A man of their infirmity.

SICINIUS

It were well we let the people know it.

CORIOLANUS

Were I as patient as the midnight sleep,
By Jove, it would be my mind!

SICINIUS

It is a mind
That shall remain a poison where it is,
Not poison any further.

CORIOLANUS

(EXPLODES)
"Shall remain"!
Hear you this Triton of the minnows? Mark

YOU

His absolute "shall"?

BRUTUS

Why, should the people give
One that speaks thus their voice?

CORIOLANUS

I'll give my reasons,
More worthier than their voices!

Menenius tries to pull him away, Coriolanus shakes free and continues the attack:
 

51

CORIOLANUS
By Jove himself,
It makes the consuls base; and my soul

ACHES

To know, when two authorities are up,
Neither supreme, how soon confusion,
May enter 'twixt the gap of both and take
The one by the other.
The crowd roars angrily -- Coriolanus spins on them:

CORIOLANUS

Thus we debase the nature of our seats, and make the rabble

Call our cares fears; which will in time Break ope the locks of the Senate, and

BRING IN

The crows to peck the eagles!

MENENIUS

Come, enough!

BRUTUS

Enough, with over-measure.

SICINIUS

(calls to the mob)
He has spoken like a traitor, and shall

ANSWER

As traitors do!
At the word "traitor" Coriolanus loses all reason, he is

FIRE:

CORIOLANUS

Thou wretch, despite overwhelm thee!

BRUTUS

Manifest treason!

SICINIUS

This is a Consul? No!

CORIOLANUS

Hence, old goat!
Coriolanus grabs Sicinius roughly and flings him aside--

At this -- the crowd ROARS in outrage -- the TV crews hustle
 

FOR POSITION--

Menenius pulls Coriolanus off:











52.

MENENIUS

On both sides more respect!

SICINIUS

(calling to the crowd)

Here's he that would take from you all your power!

The crowd reacts angrily -- surging forward against the restraint of the police.

We see grim RIOT POLICE marching into position. The crowd is not intimidated, they are spoiling for a fight.

The Tribunes provoke the crowd even more, escalating and building the fever:

BRUTUS
You are at point to lose your liberties!
Martius would have all from you, Martius,
Whom late you have named for Consul.

SICINIUS

What is the city but the people?!

TAMORA

True! The people are the city!

SICINIUS

We do here pronounce, upon the part of the people,

Martius is worthy of present DEATH!
A huge roar from the mob. Panic and violence building. Fast

AND OVERLAPPING:

BRUTUS
Guards, seize him!

CORIOLANUS

No, I'll die here!
 

BRUTUS

Lay hands upon him!

SICINIUS

(to the crowd)

HELP, YE CITIZENS!

At his cue--

The civil violence threatened from the opening moments of this story finally EXPLODES--











53.

With Cassius and Tamora in the forefront, the crowd attacks

THE POLICE--

Riot Police march in, slamming ahead with riot shields and

TRUNCHEONS--

The mob fights back with anything at hand -- some are armed with clubs and knives, others snatch up garbage cans and newspaper vending machines, throwing them, smashing windows, battling the police, kicking and punching and screaming-- It is civil disobedience. But it is also drunken, thug violence. Terrifying in its intensity--

Menenius gets Titus and Cominius to hustle Coriolanus away--

MENENIUS

Go, get you to your house! Be gone, away!
All will be naught else--

COMINIUS

Come, sir, along with us--
They hurry Coriolanus away--

The Riot Police, outnumbered, start firing TEAR GAS into the

CROWD--

SCREAMS--

TV news crew filming--
Chaotic, flurried violence--
Shaky TV images, cell phone video--
Choking, acrid gas--
It is a terrifying descent into public madness as all order
 
breaks down.

Rome is bloody.

INT. SENATE-OFFICE - DUSK

Menenius and the Tribunes are gathered in a darkened office for some high-stakes politicking.

Tamora, her face bloody from the riot, is with them. So too some supporters on either side.











54.

MENENIUS

(URGENTLY)
As I do know the Consul's worthiness,
So can I name his faults--

SICINIUS

Consul! What Consul?

MENENIUS

The Consul Coriolanus.

BRUTUS

He Consul?!

SICINIUS

It is decreed
He dies tonight.

TAMORA

He's a disease that must be cut away.

MENENIUS

0, he's a limb that has but a disease: Mortal, to cut it off; to cure it, easy. What has he done to Rome that's worth his death? Eh?

Killing our enemies?!
He sees that his words are having some effect, he presses
the

POINT:
 

MENENIUS

The blood he hath lost --
He dropped it for his country.
Some in the room murmur agreement.

BRUTUS

We'll hear no more--

MENENIUS
Consider this: he has been bred in the

WARS

Since he could draw a sword, and is ill

SCHOOLED

In graceful language Give me leave, I'll go to him, and undertake to bring

HIM

Where he shall answer by a lawful form, In peace, to his utmost peril.

PRO-CORIOLANUS SENATOR

Noble tribunes,
It is the humane way.











55.

ANOTHER SENATOR

The other course

Will prove too bloody, and the end of it Unknown to the beginning.

Sicinius is about to retort when Brutus stops him.

Brutus assents, assuming the voice of reason:

BRUTUS

Be you then as the people's officer.
Menenius and Coriolanus' supporters are relieved.

BRUTUS

If you bring not Martius, we'll proceed In our first way.
 
MENENIUS

I'll bring him to you.
He goes quickly.

Brutus turns to Sicinius and Tamora and begins to quietly explain his plan.

INT. MARTIUS VILLA-CORRIDOR - DAY

Coriolanus strides angrily down a long corridor, in and out of shafts of light, seething to Titus:

CORIOLANUS

Let them pull all about mine ears,

PRESENT ME

Death on the wheel or at wild horses' heels,

Yet will I still be thus to them--!

TITUS

MARTIUS--

CORIOLANUS

(CONTINUING UNABATED)

I muse my mother
Does not approve me further!
He slams through a door to the living room...

INT. VILLA -- LIVING ROOM - DAY

And stomps to confront his mother, who is currently conspiring with Menenius and a few Senators.











56.

CORIOLANUS

(to Volumnia, angrily)
I talk of you!

Why did you wish me milder? Would you

HAVE ME

False to my nature? Rather say I play
 
The man I am!

She is equally tough with him, not giving an inch, snapping

RIGHT BACK:

VOLUMNIA

0, sir, sir, sir,

I would have had you put your power well on,
Before you had worn it out.

CORIOLANUS

Let go!

VOLUMNIA

You might have been enough the man you are,

With striving less to be so!

CORIOLANUS

Let them hang!

VOLUMNIA
Av, and burn too!
Her outraged fury matches his. Overpowers his.

MENENIUS

(TO CORIOLANUS)

Come, come, you have been too rough, something too rough.
You must return and mend it.
Coriolanus turns away.

VOLUMNIA
Pray, be counseled.
I have a heart as little apt as yours,
But yet a brain that leads my use of

ANGER

To better vantage.

MENENIUS

Well said, noble woman!

CORIOLANUS

What must I do?
 




57.

MENENIUS

Return to the Tribunes.

CORIOLANUS
Well, what then? What then?

MENENIUS

Repent what you have spoke.

CORIOLANUS
For them? I cannot do it to the gods.
Must I then do it to them?

VOLUMNIA

You are too absolute,
Though therein you can never be too
noble.

CORIOLANUS

(upset, walking away)
Why force you this?
She pursues him:

VOLUMNIA

Because that now it lies you on to speak To the people, not by your own instruction,

Nor by the matter which your heart
prompts you,
But with such words that are but

REHEARSED IN

Your tongue, though but bastards and

SYLLABLES

Of no allowance to your bosom's truth...

She moves closer to him. Her voice lower. A sort of seduction.

VOLUMNIA

I would dissemble with my nature where
My fortunes and my friends at stake

REQUIRED

I should do so in honor...
She is very close now. Whispering. She touches him gently,
 
like a lover.

VOLUMNIA

I am in this your wife, your son,
These senators, the nobles
And you.
A long beat. All are silent, watching her spin her web.











58.

VOLUMNIA

I prithee now, my son,
Go and say to them
Thou art their soldier, and being bred in

BROILS

Has not the soft way
In asking their good loves; but thou wilt

FRAME

Thyself, forsooth, hereafter theirs.

MENENIUS

This but done, even as she speaks,
Why their hearts were yours.

VOLUMNIA
Prithee now,
Go, and be ruled...
(laughing to him)
Although I know thou hadst rather
Follow thine enemy in a fiery gulf
Than flatter him in a bower.

Coriolanus smiles. A genuinely sweet moment between them.

Cominius enters with several other political supporters.

COMINIUS

Sir, it is fit

You make strong party, or defend yourself By calmness or by absence. All's in anger.

MENENIUS

Only fair speech.
 

COMINIUS

I think it will serve, if he
Can thereto frame his spirit.

VOLUMNIA

He must -- and will.

(TO CORIOLANUS)

Prithee now, say you will, and go about it.

CORIOLANUS

MUST I

With base tongue give my noble heart

A lie that it must bear? . Well, I will do it.

But he is still agitated. Volumnia shares a concerned glance with Menenius.











59.

CORIOLANUS

(BITTERLY)

Away, my disposition, and possess me Some harlot's spirit. A beggar's tongue Make motion through my lips, and my armed knees,

Who bowed but in my stirrup, bend like

HIS
That hath charity received!
The thought of begging is too much, he rejects it, breaking

AWAY:

CORIOLANUS

I will not do it!
Lest I cease to honor mine own truth
And by my body's action teach my mind
A most inherent baseness.
Volumnia snarls at him, exasperated, building to a thunder
 
that dwarfs his:

VOLUMNIA

At thy choice, then!
To beg of thee, it is my more dishonor
Than thou of them. Come all to ruin! Let
Thy mother rather feel thy pride than

FEAR

Thy dangerous stoutness, for I mock at

DEATH

With as biq heart as thou! Do as you like!
The words echo.

It is as if he has been slapped. His resolve vanishes.

CORIOLANUS

Pray, be content...
Mother, I am going, chide me no more.
He awaits her approval.
She will not yet grant it.

CORIOLANUS

Look, I am going...
Commend me to my wife. I'll return
Consul,
Or never trust to what my tongue can do
In the way of flattery further.
She graciously bows to him.











60.

VOLUMNIA

Do your will.
Then she kisses him.
And she goes.
Like a queen. Volumnia triumphant. Always.
Then a shocking hard cut to:

INT. TELEVISION STUDIO - DAY

A crowded TV studio. The audience stands are filling up.
Television cameras. Lights. Heavy security.
 

On the stage: the set for a chat show. Translight of a city skyline behind the set. Two standing microphones.

At the side of the set, Sicinius and Brutus are conspiring with the two citizen activists, Cassius and Tamora:

BRUTUS

(TO SICINIUS)

In this point charge him home: that he

AFFECTS

Tyrannical power. If he evade us there,
Enforce him with his envy to the people.

SICINIUS

(TO TAMORA)

Have you a catalogue
Of all the voices that we have procured
Set down by the poll?

TAMORA

I have; it's ready.

SICINIUS

When the people hear me say "It shall be

SO

In the right and strength of the
Commons," be it either

For death, for fine, or banishment, then let them,
If I say "Fine," cry "Fine!" - if
"Death," cry "Death!"

TAMORA

We shall inform them.











61

Cassius and Tamora hurry off to instruct and manipulate the crowd as best they can. They mix with the audience in the stands.

MEANWHILE--
 

A gloomy but resolved Coriolanus walks with Cominius and Menenius between the tiers of audience, on the way to the set.

COMINIUS

ARM YOURSELF

To answer mildly, for they are prepared
With accusations, as I hear, more strong
Than are upon you yet.

CORIOLANUS

The word is "mildly." Pray you, let us go.
Let them accuse me by invention, I

Will answer in mine honor.

MENENIUS

Ay, but mildly.

CORIOLANUS

Well, mildly be it then. Mildly!

Coriolanus steels himself as they emerge from between the stands and head toward the set.

TV news crews are waiting. Blinding lights snap on.

The crowd, on seeing Coriolanus, lets out a ROAR. Deafening and savage.

We see Cassius and Tamora moving through the crowd, instigating, convincing, imploring.
Coriolanus ignores it all. Imperious to the end.

Brutus and Sicinius wait on the set.

BRUTUS

(whispers to Sicinius)
Put him to choler straight.

Coriolanus and his supporters move to the stage. Coriolanus glares at the Tribunes. The TV crews take up position. Menenius gestures for Coriolanus to step to the microphone, whispering to him:











62.

MENENIUS

Calmly, I do beseech you.
 
Coriolanus steps to the microphone.

Brutus gestures for the crowd to quiet down.

We see bits of this scene through the monitors on the TV cameras.
When the crowd is silent, Coriolanus begins to make a

REHEARSED SPEECH:

CORIOLANUS

The honored gods--

But his voice echoes badly with reverb. Menenius adjusts the microphone. Coriolanus begins again, quickly and by rote:

CORIOLANUS

The honored gods

Keep Rome in safety, and the chairs of

JUSTICE

Supplied with worthy men. Plant love among us.

Throng our large temples with the shows of peace,
And not our streets with war.

COMINIUS

Amen, amen.

MENENIUS

A noble wish.
His boilerplate speech over, Coriolanus turns to Sicinius

who
is at the other standing microphone:

CORIOLANUS

Shall I be charged no further than this present?

Must all determine here?

SICINIUS

I do demand,
If you submit you to the people's voices.

CORIOLANUS

I am content.
