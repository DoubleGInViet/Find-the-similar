He clicks a button on his phone. The children each have ear buds in one ear.

CHILD 1
When I was a small child on a family safari I watched my parents be eaten by a Tiger.
 
37.


CHILD 2
For some reason after hours of
devouring my Mother Linda and
Father Ted, the massive beast
simply walked right past me and

back into the jungle.

CHILD 3
Ever since the day when that bloody faced tiger walked calmly past me...

PETER ISHERWELL
... I have struggled with human
interaction. So I thank these
children from my Wishing Well
Foundation for helping me to
express myself. Each of them has
also lost their family from
traumatic events.

CHILD 2
And because of the struggles I have with communication from my terrible experience I never got to have one thing you all take for granted:


PETER ISHERWELL
...a friend to blow out the candles on my birthday cake with.

Voice recognition appears on the screen: “I want a birthday cake.”

BASH PHONE VOICE (V.O.)
Peter Isherwell wants a birthday

cake.

PETER ISHERWELL
All of my work has been driven by the want of a friend to understand me and sooth me.

And finally my years of work have come to fruition... with BASH Liif. Our new BASH 14 point three phone is fully integrated into your every feeling and desire.

Peter and the children hold up the new cell phone.

PETER ISHERWELL (CONT'D)
If I feel...
 
38.


CHILD 1
Sad.

CHILD 2
Afraid.

CHILD 3
Or alone.

PETER ISHERWELL
...my BASH phone when set to Liif setting, instantly senses my mood through blood pressure, heart rate and search preferences...

PHONE VOICE (V.O.)
Your vitals show that you are sad.

This will cheer you up Peter.

“Here, this will cheer you up...” appears on the screen and a VT of a CUTE LITTLE GIRL singing a song comes up.

It then posts the video on Vroom Vroom social media and orders the original song for purchase.

PETER ISHERWELL
...It also schedules a therapy session with a nearby professional so we can make sure this sad feeling doesn’t return.

CHILD 1
And orders Mr. Isherwell a Whip
ride to take him to the

appointment.

All of these functions play out on the screen behind him.

PETER ISHERWELL
And to support BASH Liif I would like to officially announce that we have just made over 400 billion dollars in major acquisitions of...

CHILD 1/CHILD 2/CHILD 3 ...news, media, private hospitals, retail outlets, pet stores, book stores and delivery services.

Logos for companies appear on the screen behind him. Dozens and dozens.

A DELIVERY MAN in a blue polo holding a cake with a lit candle on it enters.
 
39.


DELIVERY MAN
Excuse me! Did someone order a

birthday cake?!

Peter walks up to the edge of the stage and smiles and giggles at his cake.

CHILD 2
Happy.

CHILD 1
Happy.

CHILD 3
Happy.

He blows out the candle. The crowd breaks into thunderous applause.

SMASH CUT:


INT. BACKSTAGE - 20 MINUTES LATER

Isherwell and the children exit to the backstage. A HANDLER ushers the children off.

EXECUTIVE
That was stellar Peter. And truly

moving.

HANDLER
Come on kids. Let’s get you back in the van.

A Junior Executive takes their phones.

JUNIOR EXECUTIVE
Give me the phones. They’re not

yours.

KIDS
Bye Mr. Isherwell... Bye Peter...

We love you.

PETER ISHERWELL
(ignores the children)

Are we sure the video of the little girl singing is optimizing our pre-pubescent sense memory consumer sector? I find her eyes disconcerting.
 
40.


EXECUTIVE
We’ll cross check the data on that for sure.

JUNIOR EXECUTIVE
I’ve never cared for her.

TECH JOURNALIST APPROACHES ISHERWELL.

TECH JOURNALIST
Peter, hi. Kendra Drake from
Download. Are you concerned about
the costs of materials for the new
14.3? At 1900 dollars a phone how
can BASH sell enough to support the
Liif platform?

PETER ISHERWELL
Who is this? There are no questions scheduled for the backstage moment.

The Executive forcefully ushers the Journalist away.

EXECUTIVE
This is not aggressive... I am

handling this well.

TECH JOURNALIST
Just because you’re saying it

doesn’t mean it’s true.

A JUNIOR EXECUTIVE in stylish glasses pulls Isherwell aside.

JUNIOR EXECUTIVE
Mr. Isherwell, Paul Debent wanted me to give you this. He got it from an astronomer friend of his in Mexico.

She hands him a PICTURE OF THE BLURRY COMET with “Direct hit” handwritten on it.

PETER ISHERWELL
Oh my.


INT. BALTHAZAR RESTAURANT - AFTERNOON

Kate, Randall and journalist ADUL GRELIO, 47, handsome and international, sit eating fries and salads. THE PICTURES OF THE COMET ARE ON THE TABLE.
 
41.


ADUL GRELIO
You’ll have to give me a second...
This is a lot to take in. This

can’t be real. It just can’t.

RANDALL
It’s absolutely true. These photographs and our data have been verified by NASA high ranking officials.

Kate hands Adul a thumb drive.

KATE
Here’s a thumb drive with all the calculations on it. I don’t know how sharp your celestial mechanics are, but it’s basically the most terrifying shit I’ve ever seen.

Randall opens a FedEx envelope and takes out a single Xanax and bites off a quarter of it. Kate snatches the rest of the pill and downs it.

RANDALL
Please stop doing that.

KATE
No.

ADUL GRELIO
Can I contact this NASA official?

RANDALL
Yes, of course. His encrypted
contact information is on the zip

drive.

ADUL GRELIO
And I’ll need to verify this with

an outside scientist.

RANDALL
Of course.

ADUL GRELIO
(looking at the pictures)
I just don’t get it. How is the
whole world not screaming about

this?
 
42.


INT. NEW YORK HERALD OFFICE - 90 MINUTES LATER

Now Randall and Kate are in a conference room at the Herald with the CHIEF EDITOR PAULA WOODS, 51, two of the OWNERS and Adul Grelio.

RANDALL
A few scientists are aware but the highly specialized equipment needed to observe it have kept the circle tight.

CHIEF EDITOR PAULA WOODS What other confirmation do we have on this Adul?

ADUL GRELIO
I’ve spoken to Dr. Oglethorpe in
DC. He confirmed it and all the

math. Plus I showed it to Dr. Franks at Columbia and he almost fell out of his chair. I was very skeptical at first but this is all quite credible.

CHIEF EDITOR PAULA WOODS Jesus. And the President really said to sit tight?

RANDALL
That’s correct.

MRS. TANKEN
Of course she did. Probably worried about the midterms.

Everyone’s CELLS BUZZ.

ADUL GRELIO
What is this?

CHIEF EDITOR PAULA WOODS
We’ve been bought by BASH cellular?

One of the owners MRS. TANKEN, patrician with a hearing aid, is clearly caught off guard.

MRS. TANKEN
We did not want you to find out this way Paula. But revenue was not sustainable. Isherwell guaranteed us editorial control.
 
43.


CHIEF EDITOR PAULA WOODS And no one felt the need to confer with me?

The other owner BENJAMIN, 38, chimes in.

BENJAMIN
You know how these things go Paula. If it had leaked we would have looked desperate. Which we are.

ADUL GRELIO
Hey. We’ve got the biggest story since the Pentagon Papers in front of us. Can’t this boardroom BS wait?

CHIEF EDITOR PAULA WOODS Okay, okay. Adul’s right. We need to move fast. The Feds will claim breach of security so make sure these two get a pro bono attorney.

MRS. TANKEN
You can use my attorney.

CHIEF EDITOR PAULA WOODS You can certainly afford it now.

ADUL GRELIO
Stop it Paula.

RANDALL
Excuse me. How is it criminal to

just tell people what we saw?

BENJAMIN
(re: Randall)
Make sure this one gets some kind
of media training before he hits

the shows. He seems a step slow.


EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - 20 MINUTES LATER

Kate and Randall followed by Phillip, Kate’s boyfriend, are pulling their bags and looking for the Westin Hotel.

PHILLIP
I just don’t understand why you
can’t tell me what this is about?

(MORE)
 
44.

PHILLIP (CONT'D)
I mean you haven’t read my piece on Conlon getting hard in front of the art classes, it featured on Diddly for an hour this morning by the way, and now Adul Grelio has come down from his mountain top for your thing and you won’t even give me a lousy pronoun.

Kate stops suddenly.

KATE
A comet bigger than the asteroid that killed the dinosaurs is headed directly at earth. If it isn’t deflected the entire planet dies.

Phillip is stunned. A PASSERBY stops.

PASSERBY
What did you just say?

KATE
It’s for a video game.

Passerby moves on.

PHILLIP
Oh my God... You’re serious aren’t you? But that can’t be... Oh my God... Oh God...

Phillip hyperventilates and starts to walk into the street where he is almost hit by a car. Kate pulls him back.

KATE
Phillip!!

Randall’s phone buzzes.

RANDALL
(reading his texts)
They want us on a show called The
Daily Rip first thing in the
morning tomorrow when the article

comes out. What is the Daily Rip?

Phillip is now hunched over and hyperventilating.

PHILLIP
It’s the show. It’s the one everyone wants to be on... Brie and Jack... they have legendary chemistry...

(MORE)
 
45.

PHILLIP (CONT'D)
I almost went on once and I
couldn’t sleep for two nights I was
so excited... But they cut me for
time... It still hurts to think

about it.

Phillip almost gets hit by a car again but Kate pulls him aside.

RANDALL
(on his phone)
Hey buddy. It’s Dad. Can you tell
your Mother to send me two pills

this time?


EXT. SPACE - SAME TIME

TOTAL BLACKNESS. THERE IS A BLINKING LIGHT IN THE DISTANCE growing larger at an astonishing rate. Suddenly the light is upon us in a BLINDING MASSIVE FLASH.


EXT. MIDTOWN MANHATTAN - THE NEXT DAY

A 30 Rock type building. “The Daily Rip” T-shirts for sale in the gift store window. People bustling everywhere. A TOWN CAR pulls up and Randall and Kate get out. They are greeted by a TALENT P.A.

TALENT P.A.
You must be Dr. Mindy and Ms. Dibiasky. This way please. Jack and Brie are so excited to have you on the show.

RANDALL
Really? They know who we are?

TALENT P.A.
(after a beat)
I’m sorry. I was raised super
religious and I don’t ever lie.
Jack and Brie don’t know who you

are.

KATE
Well praise Jesus.


INT. THE DAILY RIP STUDIO - SAME TIME

Randall and Kate are led to the makeup room. A young GROOMER covered in tattoos meets them.
 
46.


GROOMER THALIA
Hi I’m Thalia. The Herald sent me

to help with your wardrobe.

She holds up two fashionable outfits.

RANDALL
Hi. I’m Randall. This is Kate.

KATE
No. I’m not wearing that.

They sit in the hair and makeup chairs.

HAIR PERSON
(to Randall)

You actually have a great facial structure. Do you mind if I trim this beard? And maybe put a little product in your hair?

RANDALL
Sure. If you think it looks nice.

He’s opening another FedEx package and takes a nibble of a pill.

KATE
So I’ll start by describing the comet discovery and then you talk about what it means and how urgent it is to take action.

RANDALL
But how do we... you know, how do
we say it?	Shouldn’t we practice

it... or write it out beforehand?

KATE
What do you mean? We just say it.

Kate reaches for the pill but Randall puts it in his shirt pocket first.

RANDALL
We’re basically delivering the most devastating and traumatic news possible.

KATE
Screw it. I’ll just say it.

HAIR PERSON
What are you on the show for again?
 
47.


KATE
We found a cure for hair loss.


INT. LANSING MICHIGAN - SAME TIME

June Mindy, Randall’s wife and his two sons are up early eating eggs and waiting for the Daily Rip to start.

JUNE
He just needs to breathe. Breathe

and sit up straight...

MARSHALL
He’s going to be fine Mom.

EVAN
How serious is this comet?

JUNE
He said it’s a potentially very

significant event.


INT. STUDIO BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Randall is in the bathroom with his outfit taking deliberate deep breaths trying to calm down.

RANDALL
You are here now... You are here

now...


INT. AUTOPSY OFFICES - SAME TIME

Phillip, eating a Danish, watching the TV in the packed office.

PHILLIP
(to someone across the
room)

My girlfriend is going to be on the Daily Rip... Yeah, it’s a pretty big story... Kate, her name is Kate... Is she hot? What are you a frat guy from 1990?..... But yes, she is.


INT. NEW YORK HERALD OFFICE - SAME TIME

The Chief Editor Paula Woods is on the phone. Adul Grelio sits in his office.
 
48.


CHIEF EDITOR PAULA WOODS
Okay then... If that’s your

statement that’s your statement.

She hangs up.

CHIEF EDITOR PAULA WOODS (CONT'D)
White House is denying they even
met with them. Says Mindy and the
PHD student aren’t credible and
Oglethorpe is looking for some

publicity to boost his career.

ADUL GRELIO
Assholes.


INT. THE DAILY RIP STUDIO - CONTINUOUS

OPENING VT PACKAGE FOR THE DAILY RIP PLAYS and we meet our hosts: JACK BREMMER, 48, in the know but also a bit charmingly dumb and BRIE EVANTEE, 45.

JACK BREMMER
President Orlean’s Supreme Court
nominee Sheriff Conlon has now been
identified as appearing in a soft
core porn cable show from the early
90s called “Satin Sheet Nights.”
This story just keeps going and
going doesn’t it Brie?

BRIE EVANTEE
It’s certainly got stamina. And have I seen Satin Sheet Nights? No comment. Do I think President Orlean’s nominee is toast? Yes comment. And the comment is “you’re damn right I do.”

JACK BREMMER
Not so fast. Party support is still strong. In fact, a recent Pranlassen poll shows Sheriff Conlon went up a point since yesterday...

BRIE EVANTEE
Which is pathetic.

JACK BREMMER
So it looks like President Orlean’s Sheriff may make it to high noon yet.
 
49.


INT. CRAPPY APARTMENT - WASHINGTON DC - SAME TIME

Teddy is having coffee with the Daily Rip on the TV while working on his laptop. Lots of pictures of his kids and one framed game photo of an Eagles player are the only decoration in his apartment. He talks to his CAT who walks across the back of the couch.

DR. OGLETHORPE
You hear that Re-run? That’s the
calm before the storm of all

storms.


INT. GREEN ROOM - SAME TIME

Randall, groomed and in his new stylish clothes, and Kate are seated and waiting their turn. There’s a YOUNG SINGER WITH AN ENTOURAGE also in the room. This is RILEY BINA, 25.

KATE
You actually look good Dr. Mindy.

RANDALL
What? Oh, thanks.

A STAGE MANAGER pops in.

STAGE MANAGER
So Jack and Brie are doing 10 on
the SCOTUS nominee. Then Riley

Bina, you come on...

RILEY BINA
Okay. And I can talk about my new
single right? A portion of the
profits goes to manatee

sanctuaries.

STAGE MANAGER
Yes, but the break up first.

RANDALL
Is that Riley Bina?

KATE
I think so.

STAGE MANAGER
And then Dr. Mindy and Ms. Dibiasky you both come on to talk about the planet you discovered.
 
50.


RANDALL
Comet. We found a comet.

KATE
Excuse me. Do the hosts know what

we’re here to talk about?

STAGE MANAGER
Of course. Jack and Brie love doing science segments.

Stage Manager exits.

RILEY BINA
You guys found a comet? That’s dope. I have a tattoo of a shooting star on my back.

RANDALL
That’s terrific. I’m sorry about your break up by the way. You seem like a wonderful person.

RILEY BINA
Well maybe you should mind your own business you old fuck.

RANDALL
Oh. Okay.


INT. THE DAILY RIP STUDIO - 30 MINUTES LATER

Jack and Brie are interviewing Riley Bina.

BRIE EVANTEE
I know you’ve been through a lot...

RILEY BINA
It’s been hard. My friends and my
Vroom Vroom Army have picked me
up... but still... I’m not gonna

lie, I’ve been down.

BRIE EVANTEE
Is there any message you want to

send to your ex DJ Chello?

RILEY BINA
Yes there is... Chell... I still love you... and after a lot of sleepless nights... I want to take you back.
 
51.


BRIE EVANTEE
Wait a minute! He cheated on you

and you want him back?

JACK BREMMER
Whoah! DJ Chello, I hope you’re
watching. You’re a very, very lucky

man!


INT. THE MINDY HOME - LANSING MICHIGAN - SAME TIME

June and her sons are watching. One of the sons is on Social media.

EVAN
Oh my God, Diddly just exploded. So did Vroom Vroom.

MARSHALL
BASH News just gave me 8 push
notifications. And my phone
purchased DJ Chello’s latest
single... What the hell? It just

did that without asking...

JUNE
Who are these people again?


INT. TEDDY OGELTHORPE’S APARTMENT - SAME TIME

Teddy sips his coffee as he watches Riley Bina.

DR. OGLETHORPE
Good for you little lady.

Forgiveness is the whole damn game.

JACK BREMMER (SOT)
I’ve just been told we have DJ

Chello live on a Mugg link!

DJ CHELLO 26 is on a Skype type link.

DJ CHELLO (SOT)
(tearing up)
Hey baby doll, your kid messed up
bad. Lady Baroque wasn’t wearing
panties that night at the club...
and I got stupid. But it’s always
been you girl. Always
 
52.


INT. AUTOPSY OFFICES - SAME TIME

Autopsy already has a full staff meeting as the show keeps playing.

RILEY BINA (SOT)
Aw Chell, I know how that girl works it. I hooked up with her at the Music Globes last year. Right before I ran off with that power forward from the Nuggets. It’s all just drama. But I want you to be my happy ending.

AUTOPSY EDITOR IN CHARGE Sonya you see if you can get a quote from Lady Boutique... Damain, get a list going: ”Celebs who got it right the second time.”

DJ CHELLO (SOT)
Hey my little bumble bee... will

you marry me?

RILEY BINA
Aw Chell. Yes. Hell yes.

PHILLIP
And hey, I hear there’s another big story coming up.

DAMAIN
What about “Forget break up sex,

try a break up relationship?”

PHILLIP
(can’t help himself)
10 Famous Second Chances for Two

Timers?

Phillip glances nervously at the TV.


INT. THE DAILY RIP STUDIO - 10 MINUTES LATER

Brie and Jack come back from commercial.

BRIE EVANTEE
Wow. The fireworks have certainly

gone off today...

JACK BREMMER
This show has been intense. I need a temple rub and a Martini.
 
53.


BRIE EVANTEE
Well, our last guests...

STAGE MANAGER cues Randall and Kate to take their seats.

STAGE MANAGER
(whispering)

Go, go, go!

BRIE EVANTEE
...have made a pretty big discovery in space. Astronomer Dr. Randall Mindy and PHD candidate Ms. Kate Dibiasky are here. Welcome.

RANDALL
Hello. Hi.

KATE
Thank you for having us.

JACK BREMMER
Can I just ask one thing before we go any further: is there life out there? Yes or no? Final answer.

RANDALL
Well that’s not really my field of study. But there have been hundreds of exo-planets discovered lately.
(being playful)
So sure. Why not. Aliens are real.

Kate gives Randall a quick sideways glance.

JACK BREMMER
I knew it! I knew it! I like this

guy!

BRIE EVANTEE
Please don’t encourage him Dr.

Mindy. You’ll regret it!


INT. THE MINDY HOME - LANSING MICHIGAN - SAME TIME

June and their sons watch their Dad.

EVAN
Dad looks good. Doesn’t he look

good?

Keith Ollens enters the house.
 
54.


KEITH OLLENS
Sorry I’m late! Wow. Randall looks great!


INT. THE DAILY RIP STUDIO - CONTINUOUS

BRIE EVANTEE
Now Jack was having some fun about the aliens but I’m told there’s a New York Herald story that has just come out that talks about a very serious discovery you two have made.

RANDALL
That’s right Brie. Kate was observing supernovas on the Subaru optical telescope when she made a breathtaking and once in a career discovery.

JACK BREMMER
That sounds very exciting. Please
tell us what you saw Ms.

Dibiasky...

KATE
(a little awkward) Well, I was monitoring for exploding stars... to improve the measurement of the expansion of the universe... but I saw something I didn’t recognize. It was a comet. A big one. And it’s… headed right at Earth. It’s really likely to hit.

JACK BREMMER
Now how big is this thing? Could it damage say, someone’s house?

RANDALL
Comet Dibiasky, which is what it’ll be named officially, is somewhere between 6 and 9 kilometers across. So, it’ll damage much more than a house.

JACK BREMMER
Can I somehow get it to just hit my ex-wife’s house? Would that be possible?

Brie hits his arm playfully.
 
55.


BRIE EVANTEE
Stop it! You and Shelly have a

great friendship!

JACK BREMMER
In fairness I did pay for the house the comet would hit!

BRIE EVANTEE
I apologize for him. He’s terrible!

KATE
(interrupting)

I’m sorry... But do you understand what we’re talking about?... We’re talking about the entire planet being destroyed.

Brie and Jack freeze. So does PHILLIP WATCHING AT AUTOPSY.

BRIE EVANTEE
We’re just having a little fun. It’s something we do around here to keep the bad news light.

JACK BREMMER
Helps the medicine go down. And
speaking of medicine we’ve got a

two part-

KATE
Well maybe the destruction of the entire planet isn’t supposed to be fun.

Everyone stops.

KATE (CONT'D)
Maybe it’s supposed to be
incredibly terrifying... and
upsetting...and maybe we’re
supposed to stay up all night every
night crying... when we’re all 100%
for sure going to fucking die!

She storms off. There is a long silence.

BRIE EVANTEE
Is she always like that?

Randall is totally on the spot. Finally after a painful beat he opens his mouth...
 
56.


RANDALL
What’s that commercial, where the guy is put on the spot? You know... Meow?
(alt)

I guess I should have let her have that Xanax.

Jack, Brie and the crew ERUPT INTO LAUGHTER.

JACK BREMMER
I knew I liked him! I knew it!

Brie gives Randall a quick intrigued glance.

BRIE EVANTEE
The handsome astronomer can come back anytime. Yelling lady, not so much.

JACK BREMMER
Join us tomorrow when our guest
will be the man who many say will
challenge President Orlean in two
years, Senator Jeff Lerner. And
word is he’s going to show us how
to make his legendary risotto.

BRIE EVANTEE
Yummm. And wrongly convicted
murderer Michelle Weems talks to us
about her third place finish on

Celebrity Dance Off.

JACK BREMMER
I thought she should have won. I

really did.

STAGE MANAGER
And we’re out!

Everyone stands up and pulls off their mics.

JACK BREMMER
You were great. And don’t worry about your friend cursing. We’ve got tape delay. She was a piece of work though!

BRIE EVANTEE
We usually get drinks after our 5
o’clock staff meeting at Aundrine

if you want to stop by...
 
57.


RANDALL
Thank you... I’ll have to see.

She gives him a hard look and then exits. The Groomer from the Herald is there.

GROOMER THALIA
You were awesome. Can I take a

picture of you for my portfolio?

RANDALL
Of course.

She takes his picture. Brie is back.

BRIE EVANTEE
I just had that terrible feeling that I was too subtle for my own good. Did it come across I’d sleep with you?

RANDALL
Um, now that you’re saying it now I guess it did.

BRIE EVANTEE
Good.

She walks away.

RANDALL
Wait, did you see where the young

lady I was with went?!


EXT. MANHATTAN BUILDING - 20 MINUTES LATER

Randall is chasing down Kate.

RANDALL
Please slow down Kate! Just hold

up.

She keeps walking but slows.

KATE
This is deranged. We have an actual scientific warning that can save billions of lives and I just had to try and impress the popular kids at the local mall.
 
58.


RANDALL
We said it though. The message is
out there! The article is

published. We did the show.

KATE
No one heard what we said!

PASSERBY gives Randall the thumbs up.

PASSERBY
Loved you on the Rip Doc!

RANDALL
Thank you!
(back to Kate)
People did hear us. And hey, they

certainly heard you!

Kate considers this.

KATE
Really?


INT. NEW YORK HERALD OFFICE - AN HOUR LATER - AFTERNOON

Randall, Kate, Adul, Chief Editor Paula Woods and the Herald’s MEDIA QUANT go through the numbers on a giant computer screen.

MEDIA QUANT
You can see this spike here is when Riley Bina asked to take DJ Chello back on the segment before you. We saw engagement across all social media platforms.

RANDALL
What about our story?

MEDIA QUANT
I apologize. In my business you
don’t see “bomb engagements” like
this very often. That’s what we
call them: bomb engagements. And

that one... is a beaut.

Beat as he admires it.

CHIEF EDITOR PAULA WOODS Erin, let’s move on.

He moves to the next page with various graphs and stats.
 
59.


MEDIA QUANT
Okay, the Herald article did get some pick up in certain scientific circles... And in some religious and fringe end times sites.

ADUL GRELIO
Nothing says journalism like “End

times sites.”

MEDIA QUANT
Randall and Kate your TV appearance got some nice traffic when Ms. Dibiasky cursed. But unfortunately there was an immediate backlash that quickly became a meme...

Screen shows VT of Kate cursing and then Michael Jordan crying. Another meme “The winner of craziest bitch on the internet goes to...”

KATE
Jesus. They just think I’m crazy.

MEDIA QUANT
Views on Ms. Dibiasky’s appearance were definitely polarizing. Negative comments ranged from “This white bitch is cancelled!” from YOL9 and “Miss Dye job’s shitty dye is melting her brain.” from DaKween438

RANDALL
I like your hair...

KATE
Stop it.

MEDIA QUANT
Other more positive comments were “She’s nuts but I’d smash that.” from Proud2BProud483 and “If we’re all gonna die can I do her in a tub?” from TricksAre4Me, quite a popular influencer. Someone started a parody account called “Crazy Freak Out Chick” that immediately got 8 thousand followers-

CHIEF EDITOR PAULA WOODS You can move on.
 
60.


MEDIA QUANT
Dr. Mindy on the other hand had very high favorables. VeganBabe wrote “Meooow. Me likey hunky Star Man” Some accounts called him “The Bedroom Eyes Doomsday Prophet” and “A.I.L.F.” which means “Astronomer I’d Like to Fuck.” Pardon my language. Annnd that’s everything. We did not feature or push on any sites. And clicks overall were below basic weather and traffic stories.

Beat.

RANDALL
That’s it?

KATE
I knew it.

CHIEF EDITOR PAULA WOODS Thank you Erin.

The Media Quant packs up. They all wait until she leaves.

RANDALL
So people didn’t really hear what

we said.

CHIEF EDITOR PAULA WOODS Scientists in Mexico and Spain are currently going through the data. And South Korea has expressed

concern.

ADUL GRELIO
Let’s not bullshit each other. Bottom line is you told us the science was 100% and it’s not. And now we look like idiots.

RANDALL
But the science is solid.

ADUL GRELIO
Dr. Jocelyn Calder the head of NASA just came out calling it “more near miss astronomy hysteria.”
 
61.


KATE
She’s the one who told us not to
tell anyone. Is she even an

astronomer?

RANDALL
(off his phone)

She’s a former anesthesiologist and a President Orlean super donor.

CHIEF EDITOR PAULA WOODS The point is, Adul’s right, there’s still serious debate. And now the Herald has egg on its face.

ADUL GRELIO
Autopsy just called me Chicken
Little with a jawline. Which is
mostly very insulting. We’ve taken

this story as far as it goes.

Adul leaves.

CHIEF EDITOR PAULA WOODS The only good news is the story fell so flat the White House isn’t crying breach of national security. And you were quite charming Dr. Mindy.

He leaves as well. Kate and Randall are alone. Randall wipes makeup off his face with a tissue.

KATE
As of right now we have exactly six months, ten days, two hours, 11 minutes and 41 seconds...


EXT. SPACE - SAME TIME

We pan up from EARTH and see a twinkling in the distance.

KATE
... until a comet the size of downtown Denver rips through our atmosphere and extincts all life on earth.


INT. NEW YORK HERALD OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

RANDALL
When did you do those calculations?
 
62.


Holds out her phone.

KATE
I just put the impact moment on a diet app. So impact is when my diet ends. Except I’m not dieting. I’m crying five times a day.

A BASH push notification comes on her phone.

KATE (CONT'D)
That prick.

EXT. PORT IN SHANGHAI - DAY - A WEEK LATER

Shipping containers are lifted and moved from massive stacks. One container with a BASH logo on it is lifted revealing Peter Isherwell, his CFO, A TRANSLATOR and Junior Executive mid stride.

A Mercedes speeds towards them and a CHINESE TELE-COM EXEC and one CHINESE GENERAL exit the vehicle with two armed GUARDS.

PETER ISHERWELL
Hello. I appreciate you keeping

this meeting private.

TRANSLATOR
(repeats in Mandarin)

CHINESE GENERAL
(in Mandarin)
Why is he looking away from us? I

do not trust this man.

CHINESE TELE-COM EXECUTIVE Why do you not make eye contact with us?

TRANSLATOR
(in Mandarin)

Mr. Isherwell watched his twin drown in front mere inches away from him when he was a teen. The trauma is still with him everyday.
 
63.


CHINESE GENERAL
(in Mandarin to the Exec)

CHINESE TELE-COM EXEC
The General says you may proceed.

PETER ISHERWELL
Tell them I want a partnership.
BASH now owns 21 percent of the US
media. That includes news,

streaming and films...

TRANSLATOR
(repeats in Mandarin)

CHINESE TELE-COM EXEC
(in English)

And you want part ownership in our Brazilian yttrium, terbium and dysprosium mines for your cell phones? And the African cobalt mines?

PETER ISHERWELL
That’s correct. Our Liif platform
will disrupt a minimum of seven
industries. With access to your
mines we could have half the planet

on it within five years.

CHINESE GENERAL
(gives a fairly long

answer in Mandarin)

TRANSLATOR
He says they want 185 billion cash, four board seats and editorial control over all BASH media.

PETER ISHERWELL
That’s absurd.

TRANSLATOR
(tells General in

Mandarin)

CHINESE GENERAL
(responds in Mandarin)

CHINESE TELE-COM EXEC
He says you forget who has the
advantage. Your country betrayed
its workers so that the very few
may be very wealthy.

(MORE)
 
64.

CHINESE TELE-COM EXEC (CONT'D)
Now we make your phones, your
cooking utensils even the silky
clothes your women wear when you
make love to them. We do not need

you. Because we already own you.

They walk away.

PETER ISHERWELL
That is very disappointing.

BASH CFO
Sorry to pile on, but news of the Chinese’s rejection of our partnership offer leaked. Our stock is already down six percent.

PETER ISHERWELL
How could it have leaked? It just

happened right now.

The sound of the little girl singing is heard on Peter’s phone.

INT. CVN CABLE NEWS STUDIO

BLACK.

WE HEAR THE AUDIO OF A MAJOR NEWS STORY FADING IN.

ANCHOR 2
It started with a photo many
thought was an armpit or the chin
of a man with a strange beard...
But what’s emerging now is a
scandal that may rock the Orlean
administration to its core as
Midterms approach... Dalia
Hensfield is live from the White

House...

CELL PHONE PHOTO PIXELATED AND SHADOWY.


EXT. WHITE HOUSE LAWN - NIGHT

A reporter DALIA HENSFIELD, 43, in front of the White House fence.
 
65.


DALIA HENSFIELD (SOT) Darren, just minutes ago an unnamed administration official told me, “Yes, it’s true. President Orlean sent her Supreme Court nominee Sheriff Conlon a cell phone picture of her privates. They’ve been having an affair for years and just had sex yesterday in the Situation Room.” Many believe this could hurt the President with the evangelical vote and cost her party the House. This is Dalia Hensfield with your BASH Cellular Scandal of the day.

BASH graphics whoosh across the screen.


EXT. DC HOTEL - NIGHT

SENATOR LERNER getting into a car addresses the press in a white collared shirt.

SENATOR LERNER
Members of my party are currently
drawing up a formal censure of the
President. It is time we restored
dignity to the White House.
Now if you’ll excuse me I have a
costume party fundraiser at a
haunted house I have to attend.

REVEAL that he is dressed as a pirate and holding a pirate hat.


INT. DR. MINDY HOME - DAY

Randall is on his home computer arguing with people on Diddly (Twitter). He has grown into his Daily Rip look nicely.

RANDALL
Oh my God sweetie, this guy doesn’t even know what a heliocentric orbit is and he’s calling me a crackpot. He says Jewish billionaires made up the comet to steal everyone’s guns..

June passes by the doorway.

JUNE MINDY
You’ve been on that site a lot

lately.
 
66.


RANDALL
I’ve got over two hundred thousand subscribers. I have to use my voice to get the word out.
(talks while typing)
It’s called “the scientific
method.” It’s what made the
computer you’re typing your half
formed ideas into right now.

JUNE MINDY (O.C.)
Randall!

RANDALL
Yes?

JUNE MINDY
Someone is here to see you!


INT. THE MINDY LIVING ROOM - SECONDS LATER

Randall enters and there are SEVEN FBI AGENTS in his living room and TWO BLACK SEDANS WITH HOOD LIGHTS FLASHING ON HIS FRONT LAWN.

RANDALL
Hello.


EXT. MICHIGAN STATE CAMPUS - SAME DAY, SAME TIME

Kate is jogging across campus. A COLLEGE GIRL hanging out with friends yells at her as she passes.

COLLEGE GIRL
(mocking)

“We’re all going to die!!”

KATE
(like she’s said it a 100
times)

Fuck off please!

Suddenly A PASSING STUDENT, A BLIND MAN WITH A CANE, A COFFEE VENDOR reveal they are undercover FBI, tackle her and draw guns on her.

FBI AGENTS
FBI! You are under arrest for
breach of national security

secrets!
 
67.


KATE
(getting on the ground)
Jesus Christ! You could have just
called me!
(sees more agents)

You pretended to be a blind guy? Was that exciting for you? You got to play dress up?


EXT. “OFFICE 4 YOU” OFFICE BUILDING - D.C. - 1 HOUR LATER

Teddy Oglethorpe exits a rent by the day office space building holding his briefcase.

Suddenly THREE BLACK SEDANS screech up to the curb and FBI AGENTS point guns at him.

FBI AGENTS
FBI! Get down on the ground!

DR. OGLETHORPE
Okay... Be cool... I just have more skin pigmentation than you because your ancestors migrated to northern Europe and developed lighter skin so as not to get vitamin D poisoning... That’s all... Otherwise we’re exactly the same...

He slowly gets on the ground.


INT. BLACK SEDAN - SAME TIME

Kate is in the back seat of a black sedan driven by TWO FEDS.
She has a HOOD OVER HER HEAD.

KATE
Unless you two assholes are taking me to the Bat Cave fuck you for putting this hood on me!


EXT. WHITE HOUSE - SIX HOURS LATER - NIGHT


INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE THE OVAL OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Teddy Oglethorpe, Randall and Kate are seated in the hallway outside the Oval Office. Two SECRET SERVICE AGENTS stand guard.
 
68.


RANDALL
What’s this about?

DR. OGLETHORPE
No idea. But that flash mob of G-Men they hit us all with makes me think they’re trying to leverage us into something.

Air Force General Themes, the General from their first White House visit walks by with TWO CONTRACTORS.

KATE
Watch out for him. He’ll charge you for free shit.

Jason, President Orlean’s son, peaks out of the Oval Office.

JASON
Guys. You can come in.


INT. OVAL OFFICE - TEN MINUTES LATER

President Orlean and Jason speak to Randall, Teddy and Kate.
Dr. Calder is also there.

PRESIDENT ORLEAN
Look there are times as a leader
when one must admit that they’ve
made a mistake... and pride must be

put aside.

She exhales a plume of smoke and dies out a cigarette.

JASON
We’ve had several scientists from Harvard and Princeton confirm your data. This is an official Presidential apology. And we are prepared to mobilize in an historic fashion to save this planet.

KATE
So basically, what you’re saying is-

DR. OGLETHORPE
Hey. There’s no need. We all get-
 
69.


KATE
-	you’re about to lose the midterms because you got caught sending pictures of your cooch to your porn star Sheriff and now suddenly it’s to your advantage to act on the comet?

Beat.
