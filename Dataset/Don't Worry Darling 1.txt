EXT. CALIFORNIA DESERT - DAY

We SOAR over the seemingly endless California desert.

FRANK (V.O.)
Are you ready to live the life you deserve?

Suddenly...houses, green lawns, swimming pools. An idyllic 50’s development, isolated within the barren landscape like a colony on Mars. A man’s BOOMING VOICE narrates...

FRANK (V.O.)
As an employee of the Oasis Project, you’re invited to live in Oasis, our private community nestled in the middle of the California desert.


EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY

1950’s Americana. PALM TREES line the streets. A MAN drives a SKY BLUE TWO-SEATER THUNDERBIRD, his happy WIFE in the passenger seat next to him. She leans over to light his CIGAR as they cruise through town.

FRANK (V.O.)
We know how hard you work and we want to provide you with the life you deserve outside of the office.


EXT. GOLF COURSE - DAY

A MAN whacks a golf ball on a bright green golf course dotted with palm trees. FRIENDS cheer him on between swigs of beer.

FRANK (V.O.)
Spend your evenings and weekends

relaxing with friends...


EXT. TENNIS COURT - DAY

Four shirtless, very tan MEN play doubles in the sunshine.

FRANK (V.O.)
Taking advantage of our many

recreational sports...
 
2.


EXT. HIKING TRAILS - DAY

A couple HIKES a dusty trail. Despite the elevation she’s in a dress, heels, and full hair and makeup.

FRANK (V.O.)
Or enjoying the breathtaking scenery of this sunbaked paradise.


EXT. THE CLUB - POOL - DAY

A row of beautiful WOMEN in stylish bathing suits and swim caps sunbathe next to the glittering COUNTRY CLUB POOL.

FRANK (V.O.)
Although you might find the best

scenery at the club pool...


EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY

Three WIVES link arms as they window-shop.

FRANK (V.O.)
While you’re hard at work, there’s plenty for your wife to do in town.

One of them stops, pointing at a DRESS in the window.

FRANK (V.O.)
Maybe too much...

Her friend drags her away.


EXT. BACKYARD - DUSK

Two kids play on a SWING SET in the shadow of the mountains.

FRANK (V.O.)
Oasis is safe and secure. Everyone is welcome here. It’s a perfect place to raise the family who depends on you...


INT. “DOLL HOUSE" NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

Dozens of couples in TUXEDOES and GOWNS dance to a LIVE BAND.
Everyone looks beautiful, happy, impossibly glamorous.
 
3.


FRANK (V.O.)
And to enjoy the wonders of a true brotherhood of intrepid pioneers.


EXT. BACKYARD POOL - DAY

A group of FRIENDS barbecue and lounge by the pool, drinking and laughing, living the life. FRANK, the narrator, walks towards us, grinning.

FRANK
It may be remote, but we have a
feeling that once you arrive,

you’ll never want to--

SMASH CUT TO:


TIGHT ON A WOMAN’S FACE

Looking straight at us, and trying so hard not to laugh it looks almost painful. This is ALICE CHAMBERS - 32, bold, equally warm and sharp.

[We’re no longer in the controlled, almost stereotypically 1950’s tone of the promotional video -- this room is loud and raucous and full of music and energy.]

WIDER reveals BUNNY (bawdy, whip-smart) and PEG (pregnant, a little thirsty) beside Alice. They’re balancing TRAYS of GLASSES on their heads and all performing the same dance. They’re drunk and can’t stop laughing and we realize...


INT. LIVING ROOM - PETER AND PEG’S HOUSE - NIGHT

It’s the end of a dinner party, and this is a boozy parlor game. These women are dancing for the HUSBANDS -- Alice’s JACK, Bunny’s DEAN, and Peg’s PETER -- who watch appreciatively from the couch, equally drunk.

Peg’s not very good at the game, frowning as she tries to keep up. Her husband PETER encourages her as he watches the rest of the room with a competitive, nervous energy--

PETER
That-- keep it straight, honey--

Bunny’s amazing at it, sipping from her own cocktail as she dances. Her husband DEAN, a boisterous jock, teases her:
 
4.


DEAN
You’re wearing too much clothing, Bunny. It’s weighing you down. If you take your shirt off...

Alice and JACK barely break eye contact as he watches her, mesmerized, totally in love. Jack is the dream partner: sexy, charming, fun, supportive, and obsessed with his wife.

The tray slips off Peg’s head and glass SHATTERS. Alice jumps, which just makes her laugh harder, and her tray falls.

ALICE
No!	Let me go again!	Let me--

She grabs the drink from Jack’s hand, downs the rest of it, and puts it on her head just as the song ends. The women end their dance with a flourish, trying to hold in laughter.

Jack jumps to his feet, wraps his arms around Alice--

JACK
You’re such a cheater!	You’re an
egregious cheater--
 

ALICE
It was quick-thinking, I’m a problem solver--
 


JACK (CONT'D)
And it was with my drink, you
made me an accomplice--

 
She laughs as he pulls her on to his lap. She slings her legs over his, very comfortable there, like it’s home base.

PEG
My balance was off, because of the baby...

BUNNY
(innocently)

What baby?

Peter hands Peg a DUSTPAN and she kneels to clean up the broken glass without question. Bunny pours Dean a drink.

BUNNY (CONT'D)
Chop chop, gentlemen.	Let’s see
some tricks.

JACK
There’s no way we could follow

that.

DEAN
Speak for yourself.
 
5.


Dean grabs three glasses and starts JUGGLING. He immediately drops all of them and they SMASH on the ground.

DEAN (CONT'D)
Peg, there’s some here, too.

Alice stands.	Jack grabs at her, pulling her back down--

JACK
No, you can’t leave...

ALICE
(amused)

I’ll be right back!

JACK
Don’t do it...

She kisses him and goes. He grins as he watches her walk away. Peter walks up to Jack, offering him a drink.

PETER
How do you do that?

He tries to say it teasingly, but there’s a jealous undercurrent.

JACK
Do what?

They both watch Alice walk into the bathroom.

PETER
That.


INT. BATHROOM - PETER AND PEG’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Alice washes her hands, swaying a little-- that moment of not realizing how drunk you are until you’re alone in a bathroom.

She dries her hands, then pours herself a glass of TAP WATER and chugs it. As she puts the glass away she notices a FRAMED PHOTO: Peter and Peg posing in front of Niagara Falls. Alice picks it up. They’re cute.


INT. LIVING ROOM - PETER AND PEG’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Alice walks in as Bunny’s dancing on a footstool, a drink in each hand. Peg’s still on her knees, cleaning up the glass. Dean starts handing out CIGARS. Peter takes one, asking--
 
6.


PETER
With the promotion, do they automatically move you to a bigger place?

BUNNY
The house will be ready by the end of the month.

PEG
Oh, Dean, will you smoke outside?

DEAN
(lighting his cigar)
Peter, your wife is drunk.	She’s

babbling nonsense.

PEG
Peter doesn’t like the sm--

PETER
Honey.

Peg quiets. Dean winks at her and balances an ASH TRAY on her back. Peg jokingly starts crawling around on the ground like an animal. Everyone laughs, until--

PEG’S SON (O.S.)
Mommy?

They all turn -- a sleepy BOY in pajamas stands on the stairs, rubbing his eyes.

PEG
Go to bed, Billy.

PEG’S SON (O.S.)
You’re being too loud.

DEAN
BOO!	Go back upstairs, you wet
blanket!	We’re praying!

The adults burst out laughing.


EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

A BIRD’S EYE VIEW of Jack’s CAR snaking through the streets of the edge of the development. His headlights are the only lights on the road.
 
7.


INT./EXT. JACK’S CAR - NIGHT

Jack drives, Alice draped over him, kissing him. They’re drunk and happy.

ALICE
I have a real question: is Peg ever not pregnant?

JACK
There have to be a few hours, at
least, when she’s actively giving

birth.

ALICE
I feel like they have 17 children.

JACK
And Peter’s always trying to

impregnate you.

ALICE
No he’s not...

JACK
I wouldn’t leave you alone with him without a very sharp weapon.

ALICE
You don’t think I could handle

Peter?

JACK
I know you could handle Peter. I didn’t say the weapon was for you.

Alice laughs just as Jack SWERVES the car off the road, squealing into the desert. Alice laughs, startled but not surprised, this is clearly something he’s done before--

ALICE
Jack!

He grins at her as makes wild turns, going faster and faster. He floors it, neither noticing as his headlights catch--

A figure standing in the middle of the desert.

They’re speeding towards it, getting closer and closer. Jack notices it the last second-- Alice SCREAMS as he swerves, just missing it, t, the car fishtailing to a stop.

Jack grips the steering wheel, adrenaline through the roof--
 
8.


JACK
Jesus CHRIST!

Alice turns to look behind her. The figure is a WOMAN in a disheveled nightgown. She’s still standing there, in the red glow of Jack’s brake lights. She never even flinched. Alice squints, realizing--

ALICE
Is that Margaret?

The woman, MARGARET, locks eyes with Alice. Alice holds her gaze, startled at the intensity but unable to look away.

JACK
Of course it is--

ALICE
What is she doing out here?

JACK
She’s a lunatic.	Oh my God.

Alice starts to open her door--

ALICE
She’s alone out there--

JACK
I’ll call Ted when we get home.

Jack floors it, speeding away. Alice looks over her shoulder: Margaret’s still standing there, getting smaller as the pull away, until finally it’s just--


A BLACK VOID

Just blackness.	Then, from overhead:

A row of beautiful DANCERS [in BLACK AND WHITE] stream into view. It’s a parade of identical women in matching outfits, practically anonymous in their uniformity.

The dancers burst into a KALEIDOSCOPE of Busby-Berkeley-style choreography, creating geometric shapes with their bodies, twirling and bending and jumping like they’re one organism.

The women dance towards each other, closer and closer, until they each hold up a FAN which creates a single image:

Alice’s terrified, screaming face. We FALL through one of her EYES like a black hole--
 
9.


INT. BEDROOM - ALICE AND JACK’S HOUSE - DAY

WHAM. Alice hits the floor of her bedroom with a sickening CRACK-- she’s flung herself out of the bed in her sleep.

She sits up, still in shock from the nightmare and the hard fall. She moves stiffly, wincing, and glances at Jack-- but he’s still asleep. She quietly gets up to start her day.


INT. KITCHEN - ALICE AND JACK'S HOUSE - DAY

Alice prepares a perfect breakfast. It’s a flawlessly coordinated routine, and she takes real pleasure in it: EGGS cracked, BACON frying, a TOMATO sliced, sliced, sliced, unnervingly close to her fingers, COFFEE poured into a cup--

Jack, in a sharp suit, hair still wet from the shower, picks the cup up to take a sip as Alice puts hot bacon on his plate. He watches her adoringly.

JACK
You remember there’s the thing at

Frank’s house tomorrow for--

ALICE
The new couple.	Yes.	I’m making
tuna noodle salad.
(off Jack’s look)

What?

JACK
It’s just, he doesn’t like tuna.

ALICE
Frank?

JACK
I know it seems small but I think
these things add up when he’s

making decisions...

ALICE
I’ll make deviled eggs.

Suddenly a small TREMOR starts shaking the house. Alice reaches behind her to hold the cabinet steady as Jack holds their coffee cups. When it stops, Alice gives Jack a look:

ALICE (CONT'D)
That’s the third one this week.

Jack is just beaming at her.
 
10.


ALICE (CONT'D)
What?

JACK
Nothing.	You’re just...the best.
I’m so lucky.

Alice kisses him, then straightens his tie, hands him his
LUNCH, and gives him a playful smack on the ass as he leaves.
He turns back to grab her, but she laughs and shoves him off--

ALICE
You’re gonna be late! These things add up!

He kisses her once more and hurries out the door. Alice watches him go, then takes a deep breath and turns back to the house, ready to tackle her day.


EXT. ALICE AND JACK'S HOUSE - DAY

Jack’s car pulls out of the driveway as all the men on the block head in the same direction toward Oasis.


INT. VARIOUS - ALICE AND JACK’S HOUSE - DAY

--	Alice WASHES her hands like a surgeon, both hands in the air, cleaning hard between each finger.

--	She SCRUBS every surface of the kitchen with an efficiency that would impress the most intense germaphobe. The original Peter Pan cartoon movie plays on the TV, keeping her company.

--	She DUSTS a row of romantic PHOTOS of her and Jack: the two of them on their wedding day, laughing on the beach on their honeymoon, posing in black tie at a town dance.

--	She SNAPS laundry straight, then folds it nicely, setting it next to a CALENDAR where four days a month are “X-ed” out.

--	She IRONS.  She SWEEPS.  She VACUUMS.


INT. KITCHEN - ALICE AND JACK'S HOUSE - DAY

Done with her work, Alice just...waits. She sits in silence, totally still. We PUSH IN slowly as a SHARP SOUND gets increasingly louder, until finally, Alice looks up:

Out her window, she can see her backyard, separated from their neighbor’s front yard by a WHITE PICKET FENCE.
 
11.


On the other side of the fence, Margaret tends to her ROSE BUSH. The ground is covered in the heads of severed white roses.


INT. BUS/EXT. STREET - DAY

Alice and other HOUSEWIVES ride the NEIGHBORHOOD TROLLEY BUS. They’re all SINGING a call-and-response song, clapping along to the rhythm.

With the men at work, during the day, Oasis is all women.
The population’s surprisingly diverse.

The jolly DRIVER pulls over at a stop and a few more WOMEN board. They immediately start singing as well.


INT. TOWN MARKET - DAY

From overhead, Alice and other HOUSEWIVES stream into view, gliding their shopping carts through the aisles like ants through an ant farm.

-- A SAMPLE GIRL is handing out free APPETIZERS.

SAMPLE GIRL
Pineapple fingers and ham?

Alice takes one, nodding her thanks without stopping.

-- She charms the BUTCHER as he cuts her a slab of meat:
 

MARKET BUTCHER ALICE When will I finally get to You never come over! see what you do with these always teasing me! beautiful cuts I give you?
 


You’re

 
-- The CHECKOUT LADY bags Alice’s food, hands it to her:

MARKET CHECKOUT LADY
Eight dollars has been added to

Jack’s account.

ALICE
Thank you so much.

In the next lane, an EMBARRASSED HOUSEWIFE is trying to quietly plead with the CHECKOUT MAN, who shakes his head.

MARKET CHECKOUT MAN
I’m sorry, ma’am, but your husband

has capped the credit at $5.
 
12.


The Housewife glances behind her, embarrassed, as she takes a few items off the counter. Alice leans over to the Checkout Lady as she leaves--

ALICE
Will you put the rest of hers on

Jack’s account, too?

The Checkout Lady nods discreetly as Alice exits.


EXT. ALICE AND JACK’S HOUSE - DAY

Alice, arms full of groceries, stands at the hedge between her front yard and Bunny’s. Bunny hangs LAUNDRY on a clothesline as her rambunctious KIDS (son HANK, 7, son FRED, 5, and daughter JANE, 3) play with the HOSE behind her.

BUNNY
Don’t point the hose at the
laundry!
(back to Alice)

Was she drunk?

ALICE
I have no idea.	She didn’t even
move.	We almost killed her.

BUNNY
You’re sure it was Margaret?

ALICE
Who else would be standing in the
middle of the desert in her

pajamas?

BUNNY
(to her kids)

Unwrap it from her neck, Hank!

Alice gestures to an Oasis-branded MOVING TRUCK parked at the end of their street.

ALICE
Have you heard anything about them?

BUNNY
They’re young, apparently.	Bill
and something.

ALICE
I guess she’ll be my new best

friend, since you’re leaving.
 
13.


BUNNY
Don’t worry.	Dean said Jack’s
gonna get promoted and you’ll be
right behind us.	What are you
making for the party tomorrow?

ALICE
Deviled eggs.

BUNNY
Oh, Jack’s gonna be CEO--

She senses chaos behind her and turns to her kids on a dime:

BUNNY (CONT'D)
That’s it.	I’m calling him.

Hank immediately drops the hose.

BUNNY’S SON HANK
DON’T!

BUNNY
I have to. This is why Santa gave me his phone number.
 

BUNNY’S SON FRED
(frantic)

WE’RE NOT DOING IT ANYMORE!
 


BUNNY (CONT'D)
He said I had to let him know
if you’re being bad--

 
BUNNY (CONT'D)
I wish it were up to me. I wish I had a choice--

She picks up the hose and starts SPRAYING the kids. They shriek, delighted, sprinting around, as Bunny chases them. They hide behind Alice, who jokingly protects them--

BUNNY (CONT'D)
You think I won’t spray her?


INT. KITCHEN - ALICE AND JACK’S HOUSE - DAY

Alice, still a little wet from the hose, cooks the same way she cleans: like she’s preparing for battle. She CHUGS a glass of water-- WASHES her hands-- WIPES clean the surfaces-- then SLAPS a thick cut of meat on a cutting board.

Alice WHISTLES a tune as she lays out her materials: twine, a needle, scissors, a MASSIVE KNIFE. She starts to hack at the meat. Slicing, slicing, slicing, until she stops with a guttural moan.
 
14.


She’s cut through the meat of her thumb, nearly severing it.
It’s dangling off of her hand like a loose tooth.

Alice’s stunned. She stares at her hand for a beat-- then reaches up and slowly pushes her thumb back where it belongs.

Something about that snaps her into TRIAGE MODE. She moves quickly and purposefully, almost like a sense memory--

She washes the wound, WINCING as the water hits the cut, then lays her hand on the counter like it’s another piece of meat.

With one hand, she lights the stove-- fishes a pair of SCISSORS out of a drawer-- then picks up the needle and twine with the scissors and holds them both over the open flame.

Once they’re sterilized, she uses the scissors to pierce the skin of the wound, then the other side, pulling tight. She twists the string, then pulls it through the cut again.

She’s suturing her own wound. Pierce, wince, swoop, bite, tie. Over and over. She flips her hand over, then sutures the other side. Finished.

Alice stares at her trembling hand, more startled by what she just did than by the cut itself. How did she do that?

Then she registers the mess in front of her. She gathers the bloody evidence, wiping up the counter--


EXT. BACKYARD - ALICE AND JACK’S HOUSE - DUSK

Alice glances around furtively as she throws the bloody evidence in the garbage. She turns to sneak back inside--

And sees Fred, Bunny’s son, watching her from the yard next door. Alice freezes.

ALICE
Hi, honey.	What are you doing?

Fred holds up a stick to answer.	Then:

FRED
What are you doing?

ALICE
My chores.	I need my allowance so
I can split it with you.

Fred grins.	Alice waves him back inside.
 
15.


INT. KITCHEN - ALICE AND JACK’S HOUSE - DUSK

Her hand wrapped in a bandage, Alice continues to cook dinner as if nothing happened.


INT. DINING ROOM - ALICE AND JACK'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Alice finishes lighting the CANDLES on a beautifully-set dining room table when HEADLIGHTS flood through the windows.

BY THE FRONT DOOR

Jack walks in to find Alice waiting in the foyer, holding a COCKTAIL in a HIGHBALL GLASS for him. He grins at the image.

ALICE
Hi.

JACK
Hi.

They say it like they really missed each other, even though it’s just been a few hours. Alice hands him the drink and takes his briefcase, then helps him pull his jacket off. There’s a heightened, sexy energy to this evening routine.

ALICE
How was your day?

JACK
Boring.	Much better now.

He notices her bandage and grabs it, immediately concerned.

JACK (CONT'D)
What happened to your hand?

Alice waves it off, trying to seem casual.

ALICE
Nothing.	I cut myself cooking.

Jack searches her face, but she looks fine. He kisses the bandage. She starts backing up, pulling him with her.

ALICE (CONT'D)
I made a roast.

JACK
It smells amazing.
 
16.


He’s backed her up against the dining table. This also seems like part of the evening routine.

ALICE
And some green beans.

JACK
What else?

He reaches up under her dress.

ALICE
Mashed potatoes...

Jack finally kisses her. She wraps her legs around him and Jack turns her around and bends her over the table as they start to have passionate, spirited sex.

Her head is inches from the lit candles and the rattling steak knives-- it feels slightly dangerous, but she doesn’t notice or care. It’s animalistic and hot and we CUT TO:

FRANK
Jack, you came!


EXT. FRANK’S HOUSE - DAY

FRANK, Oasis’s CEO and de-facto Mayor, and his wife, SHELLEY, stand in the doorway of their INSANELY GORGEOUS MANSION. It’s all clean lines and glass, practically twinkling in the sun. The sounds of a PARTY float from the backyard.

Alice (carrying a tray of APPETIZERS, and wearing white GLOVES) and Jack wave as they approach the house.

Frank is the definition of quiet power: brilliant, confident, disarming. Shelley, Oasis’s “first lady,” is warm and gracious, the ideal host.

Jack shakes Frank’s hand, still starstruck by his boss, as Alice and Shelley hug--

JACK
It’s an honor to visit your house, sir.
 

SHELLEY
Alice, welcome!	You look
wonderful.
 


ALICE
Are you kidding me?
dress--
 


This

 
SHELLEY (CONT'D)
Frank, look at her, she’s glowing.
(teasing, re: her belly)

(MORE)
 
17.

SHELLEY (CONT'D)
Is this glow due to any particular reason?

ALICE
Just general happiness, I think.

Shelley notices the edge of the bandage peeking out from Alice’s glove. Shelley reaches for it--

SHELLEY
What happened, honey?

ALICE
(pulling her glove down)

Oh, just a kitchen wound.

SHELLEY
Our battle scars.

ALICE
We’re so excited to meet the new

couple.

FRANK
They’re lovely.	Bill and Violet.
Painfully young.

ALICE
You’re hiring so often, it feels
like there’s a new couple here

every week.

JACK
(quickly)

Which, we love.

FRANK
We’re lucky to be growing. And as our best employees keep moving up, we’ll have more entry-level positions to fill.

He claps Jack on the shoulder.	Jack beams.


EXT. FRANK’S BACKYARD - DAY

Jack and Alice walk out, awed-- the back is even more gorgeous than the front. COUPLES roam around the manicured lawn and beautiful pool, past a SCALE MODEL of the town of Oasis on display. Everyone’s having fun, pouring drinks.
 
18.


Alice squeezes Jack’s hand. He kisses her cheek. Frank and Shelley’s KENNEDY-ESQUE KIDS walk around with platters of appetizers, serving in adorable outfits.

Jack sees Dean at the bar and kisses Alice before he walks over to him. Alice spots Bunny, holding a cocktail and talking to a CHATTY HOUSEWIFE. Bunny catches Alice’s eye and gives her a “thank God” look.

BUNNY
(to Chatty Housewife)

You know what, will you excuse me? I just saw Alice, and it looks like she needs help. With...her leg.

Bunny hurries over to Alice.

BUNNY (CONT'D)
Thank Christ.

ALICE
You having fun over there?

BUNNY
How long would you think she could talk about her son’s art projects? Multiply it by your entire life.

She gestures to Frank and Shelley’s kids.

BUNNY (CONT'D)
Do they wear matching outfits every day? I find them terrifying.
(takes a sip, then)

But that little one makes maybe the best Manhattan I’ve ever had.

JUMP CUT TO:


Alice, Jack, Bunny and Dean talk to the new couple, BILL and VIOLET. Bill’s sweet and anxious, like he’s always worried he’s about to screw something up. Violet’s young and eager. The women chat off to one side:

VIOLET
And then we honeymooned in Sea

Island.

ALICE
We honeymooned in Sea Island!	So
did Carol.	Did you eat at
Dominick’s?
 
19.


As Bill talks with Jack and Dean, like an eager freshmen hanging out with the cool seniors:

BILL
We’re just-- so excited to be here. Really excited. Can’t believe it, honestly.

DEAN
All right, you got the job.	Calm
down.

Back with Violet, Alice lowers her voice, kindly:

ALICE
How are you actually doing?

(off Violet’s surprise) This is a lot. You’ve met a hundred new people and are probably drowning in casseroles.

VIOLET
It’s wonderful.	We’re just
unpacking and adjusting...
(admitting)

It is kind of a lot.

Alice touches Jack, speaking loudly enough for the men:

ALICE
Why don’t you come shopping in town with us tomorrow? And Bill can golf with the boys. It’s our little Sunday tradition.

BUNNY
They exercise their bodies and we

go exercise their wallets.

DEAN
Bunny’s practically an Olympic

athlete at this point.

Violet looks to Bill for permission.	Bill glances at Jack.

BILL
Is that-- okay?	Can I do that?

JACK
(amused)

Yeah, Bill.	If you want to.

Bill can’t hide how thrilled he is.
 
20.


BILL
Okay, yeah, great.	Count me in.
Sunday golf.	With the boys.

He squeezes Violet’s hand and beams at her. Alice and Jack catch eyes, sharing a smile. He takes her hand, when--

GLASS TINKS. Everyone turns-- Shelley’s standing with Frank, tapping a glass to get everyone’s attention.

SHELLEY
Thank you for coming out to help us give a warm welcome to Bill and Violet. If you’re here, it’s because we believe you’re the best and the future of Oasis.

Some claps.	Bill flushes.	Shelley looks at Frank adoringly.

SHELLEY (CONT'D)
Bill, Violet, you don’t yet know
how lucky you are to learn from my
husband, and be a part of this
community that he created, but soon

you will.

MARGARET (O.S.)
(loudly)

We’re not alone!

Everyone turns, startled. Margaret’s standing in the middle of the crowd. TED, her mortified husband, tries to quiet her without making a scene, but Margaret doesn’t move.

MARGARET (CONT'D)
You all know it.	Something’s out
there.	And we’re hiding here.

Violet looks to Bunny and Alice, concerned:

VIOLET
Who is that?

BUNNY
Margaret.
(sotto, to Alice)

She’s gonna get Ted fired.

MARGARET
They’re out there...

Ted starts dragging her away, as--
 
21.


Frank clears his throat. Everyone immediately turns back to him, quiet. They watch him with reverence.

FRANK
Part of what makes us a family is that we support each other even in the most difficult times.
(then)

This is a special place. Shelley sometimes teases me and says I’ve created our own little world out here, but the truth is, it’s one we’ve created. And it’s one I’m so proud of. Not just because of the extraordinary and brave work you gentleman do at Oasis... but because this is a community that accepts everyone.

The crowd nods, roused.

FRANK (CONT'D)
This is what the world should look like and should feel like. Out there, arbitrary regulations and rules stop us from being as innovative as we know we can be. And if we have to create our own universe out here until everybody else catches up, so be it.

Alice glances around, realizing that Jack is gone.

FRANK (CONT'D)
We’re having a pretty good time.

Everyone CHEERS and WHOOPS, raising their glasses.


INT. FRANK’S HOUSE - DAY

Alice tiptoes down the pristine, stylish hallway, her footsteps echoing in the empty house. She whispers:

ALICE
Jack?

She walks around the corner--

MARGARET
Are you lost?

Margaret is standing right there.	Alice jumps a mile.
 
22.


ALICE
Oh my God.

MARGARET
I can’t find my way out either.

Alice studies her face, concerned.

ALICE
Are you okay, Margaret?

Margaret looks at Alice like that question is insane.

MARGARET
No.	None of us are.

ALICE
If you ever want to talk, or need
anything, you know I’m right next

door.	Last night--

MARGARET
I don’t sleep well.	I have bad
dreams.	Like you.

Alice blinks, startled.

ALICE
I don’t have bad dreams.

MARGARET
Yes you do. You see them too. And now it’s too late for both of us. We don’t belong here.

ALICE
(disturbed)

I need to find my husband...

Alice quickly walks away, leaving Margaret alone in the hallway. She rounds the corner and passes by an open door, stopping when she sees--


INT. BEDROOM - FRANK’S HOUSE - DAY

Jack is standing in Frank’s beautiful, light-filled BEDROOM.

ALICE
What are you doing?

Jack looks up, delighted to see her.
 
23.


JACK
Look at this.

She walks over Jack, who’s standing at a beautiful DRESSER. It’s covered in private details: cuff links, scattered jewelry, framed photos of Frank and Shelley. Alice picks one up: Frank and Shelley, posing in front of Niagara Falls.

JACK (CONT'D)
This is where he sleeps.	This is
crazy.

Jack’s genuinely awed by the intimate space. He touches a NECKTIE left on the dresser, admiring it, studying it.

JACK (CONT'D)
I wonder why he chose this tie.

Alice watches him lovingly. His adoration is cute, if a little obsessive. She leans into him.

ALICE
I like your ties.

Jack kisses her-- then reaches under her dress. Alice looks at him, surprised but game.

ALICE (CONT'D)
Everyone’s outside...

Jack doesn’t care. Just being in this room is a turn-on. He presses her up against the wall, unbuckling his pants as she wraps her legs around him. They start to have sex as silently as they can. Alice moans and Jack covers her mouth to keep them quiet. She grabs at him, then sees--

Frank is standing in the doorway.

Watching them. Staring at Alice. They lock eyes for a beat too long. It’s like she’s in a trance. Jack clocks it and follows her eyes-- he sees Frank, jumps, and pulls up his pants, scrambling away from Alice, caught.

FRANK
You two all right?

JACK
Yeah.	Yes sir.

Another beat. Frank just keeps staring at them. Then he grabs a pair of SUNGLASSES from the dresser, gives Jack a tiny, almost proud smirk.
 
24.


FRANK
I should’ve knocked.

Frank walks out. Jack is a buzzed combination of embarrassed and thrilled. He kisses Alice quickly before hurrying out after Frank.

Alice stands there, totally thrown, alone in Frank’s bedroom. She smooths down her dress, putting herself together, and looks down at the dresser to a FRAMED PICTURE: the whole community posing in black tie, like a class photo.

Alice finds herself in the crowd, beaming in black and white. We PUSH IN on her face until suddenly--

It cracks apart like pieces of glass.	We’re back in the...


BLACK VOID

And back in BLACK AND WHITE. The Busby Berkeley DANCERS had been holding the pieces of her face together.

They toss them aside and begin a choreography: one dancer grabs another from behind, holding her face.

It’s beautiful, but then it morphs from choreography to what seems like real violence. The first dancer covers the other’s mouth, smothering her-- she can’t breathe-- she kicks and flails, scared, and tries to SCREAM as we CUT TO--


INT. BEDROOM - ALICE AND JACK'S HOUSE - DAY

Alice’s eyes pop open-- her back is arched halfway off the bed, her body contorted, one hand smothering herself. She can’t breath. She struggles to pry her own hand off, finally getting free with a painful GASP. She catches her breath, stunned, while Jack sleeps next to her.


INT. BOUTIQUE - DAY

Alice, Bunny and Violet walk through a CLOTHING BOUTIQUE, checking out different dresses. Violet looks around, amazed--

VIOLET
We can just charge at all these

stores?

ALICE
It goes right to their Oasis

accounts.
 
25.


Alice starts WHISTLING the same tune she was whistling before.

BUNNY
They can put a limit, though, so
don’t let yourself go.
(to Alice)

What is that song?

ALICE
I was hoping you would know. It’s been in my head for days, I can’t figure out what it’s from.

BUNNY
I hate that.

Just then a TREMOR runs through the store -- everything shakes gently, the clothing racks rattling. Violet’s eyes go wide, but Alice and Bunny barely register it. It’s over as quickly as it started.

BUNNY (CONT'D)
The joys of desert living.	Soon
you’ll barely notice them.

ALICE
We never have to drive. The bus runs from morning til six and takes you everywhere you need to go.

VIOLET
Do you ever bring the boys their

lunch?

ALICE
To Oasis?

Bunny almost laughs.

BUNNY
No.	Of course not.

Violet gives them an impish look.

VIOLET
You guys have really never been? I mean, I know we’re not supposed to, but just to sneak a peek?

ALICE	BUNNY
No.	Never.
 
26.


ALICE (CONT'D)
Only employees are allowed near the headquarters.

BUNNY
It’s way too dangerous.

ALICE
And why would we?	We have
everything here.

VIOLET
What do you think they’re doing? Bill says it’s technology to create a better world--

BUNNY
(a little too sharp)
We don’t really talk about it,

honey.

Violet shrinks, self-conscious.	Bunny softens.

BUNNY (CONT'D)
Honestly, even if they tried to

explain it I couldn’t understand.

ALICE
They’re doing important work but
our work back here is just as
vital.	We have to take care of
them and support them so they can

go change the world.

VIOLET
Absolutely.	And I’m ready to do
that for Bill.	I just...
(admitting)
I’m worried I’ll get a little stir crazy.

Alice and Bunny exchange a look.	Violet clocks it.

VIOLET (CONT'D)
What?

ALICE
Margaret went out to Oasis once.

BUNNY
(”don’t do this”)

Alice--
 
27.


VIOLET
That weird woman from the party?

BUNNY
(giving in to the story)

She used to be normal.

ALICE
She went out there with her son--

BUNNY
She walked.

ALICE
Trying to get to the Oasis headquarters, they think. But she never made it. They found her alone two days later, wandering and dehydrated, totally out of it.

VIOLET
Alone, like--

BUNNY
They never found her son.

Violet’s stunned.

VIOLET
What did...

ALICE
So we can’t just go wandering

around.

BUNNY
But you won’t go stir crazy.

She says the next part for Alice’s benefit as much as
Violet’s:

BUNNY (CONT'D)
We just have to play by the rules
and then we get to enjoy all of
this.	Being a good sport is how
you get what you want.	So let’s
move on to more pressing business
and find you a dress for the
Anniversary Party.

VIOLET
What’s that?
 
28.


BUNNY
It’s the best night of the year.

It’s like our own private July 4th.

ALICE
Frank throws a blowout to celebrate the anniversary of Oasis’s incorporation.

Bunny holds up a dress.

BUNNY
The question is, how soon do you
want to have a baby?	Because if
you wear this dress, Bill will

impregnate you immediately.

VIOLET
(laughing)

Bill wants one yesterday. I gotta do my job while he does his.

CUT TO:

CLOSE ON a lawn-mower blade shredding grass.

WIDEN OUT to see a LANDSCAPER mowing the lawn of a bright green golf course at the edge of the barren, cracked desert.

EXT. COUNTRY CLUB POOL - DAY

Alice, Bunny and Violet eat lunch by the pool of a CLASSIC COUNTRY CLUB: women tanning in stylish bathing suits and swim caps, KIDS sticky with popsicles, MEN in golf clothes or tennis whites wandering around the edges.

WAITERS bring the women more drinks. One offers Violet COCONUT OIL, which she happily accepts. Bunny’s daughter Jane is curled up on Alice’s lap, explaining how her toy works. Alice listens warmly.

BUNNY
Jane!	Go find your brothers.	Let
Alice eat.

Violet watches as Jane kisses Alice and climbs awkwardly out of her lap, scurrying after the boys.

VIOLET
How many kids do you have?

ALICE
I don’t have children.
 
29.


Violet reacts as if Alice just admitted to occasional murder.

VIOLET
Oh.

BUNNY
Don’t get me started.

VIOLET
I’m so sorry.

ALICE
Don’t apologize.	It’s just not
what Jack and I want.

VIOLET
(even more surprised)
It’s on purpose?	How?
(a little embarrassed)
I mean, he’s so handsome, and he
adores you, how do you stop
yourself--

BUNNY
They don’t. I’m next door, I hear everything. She and Jack just want each other for themselves. It’s nauseating.

ALICE
Bunny’s kids like me more than they like her, anyway.

BUNNY
That’s true, and infuriating.

Alice laughs as she watches Jane and Bunny’s sons playing by the side of the pool. Behind them, a row of LADIES swim laps in matching SWIM CAPS with smiling faces on them.

VIOLET
I think three is the perfect

number.	Bill wants four.

BUNNY
Once they outnumber you, it’s all
the same.	Having a second kid is
like you’re drowning and someone

throws you a baby.
