As their heads dip in and out of the water, the faces on the swim caps MORPH into PAINED or SCREAMING faces.
 
30.


Alice blinks, startled-- but as the ladies come up for air one last time, the caps are back to normal.

BUNNY (CONT'D)
Alice, how many babies should

Violet have?

Alice shakes off that moment, turning back to the women:

ALICE
At least five.


INT. KITCHEN - ALICE AND JACK'S HOUSE - THE NEXT DAY

TIGHT SHOTS of Alice’s breakfast routine: EGG cracked, BACON fried, COFFEE poured, JACK kissed. She hands him his LUNCH.

INT. VARIOUS - ALICE AND JACK'S HOUSE - DAY

Jack gone, Alice tackles her day. She WASHES her hands like a surgeon again, careful to work around her BANDAGE.

-- She SCRUBS-- DUSTS-- VACUUMS-- SNAPS-- FOLDS--


INT. KITCHEN - ALICE AND JACK'S HOUSE - DAY

Alice wraps SARAN WRAP around leftovers, organizing the fridge. She pulls a big piece, then stares at it for a beat. Almost hypnotically, she wraps it around her face, smothering herself.

She struggles to breathe against the clear plastic, mouth open, gasping-- she leaves it on a beat too long, then quickly frees herself. She stands there, rattled.


INT. BUS/EXT. STREET - DAY

Alice rides the bus. It pulls to a stop, but she doesn’t get off. The Driver waits a beat, but she doesn’t move. He pulls back on to the road.

BUS DRIVER
No shopping today?

ALICE
I’m just here for a joyride.	Get
some fresh air, get out of the

house for a bit.

The Driver winks at her.
 
31.


INT. BUS/EXT. STREET - DAY

A HOUSEWIFE steps off at the last stop, at the very the edge of town. Alice is the only passenger left as the bus turns to make its way back into the heart of downtown.

She stares out into empty desert beyond their little village. A single road leads out to the OASIS HEADQUARTERS, barely visible in the distance. Then she spots--

There’s a plane in the sky above the Oasis Headquarters that’s starting to falter. It dips, struggling to keep its nose up, dropping dangerously. It looks like it’s out of control. She calls out without taking her eyes off of it--

ALICE
Sir?	Do you see...

It dips again, then suddenly plunges toward the ground, disappearing behind the Oasis building just as it would CRASH into the earth. Alice CRIES OUT--

ALICE (CONT'D)
OH MY GOD!

BUS DRIVER
You alright, miss?

Alice jumps to her feet and hurries up to the driver--

ALICE
Did you see that?	That plane?!

She points to where she saw it, but the sky is empty.

BUS DRIVER
I’m afraid I don’t know what you--

ALICE
It crashed!	A plane just crashed!

BUS DRIVER
(squinting as he looks)

Are you sure?

ALICE
We have to see if anyone-- drive

that way, I can show you where--

BUS DRIVER
I don’t go that way.

ALICE
What?
 
32.


BUS DRIVER
That’s not my route. I have to return to town, make sure you girls get everything you need.

ALICE
That-- people could be hurt--

BUS DRIVER
I don’t go that way.

ALICE
A plane crashed--

BUS DRIVER
That’s not my route.

Alice can’t believe him. She grabs her bag and throws him an angry look as she dashes off the bus--

ALICE
I’ll go myself.

She starts racing toward where she saw the crash. The Driver stares at her for a long beat, then slowly turns the bus back to town.


EXT. ROAD - DAY

Alice hurries toward the looming Oasis Headquarters, sweating in the sun. She passes a SIGN -- WARNING! Hazardous Materials Ahead. Security Personnel Only -- but keeps going. A lot more WARNING SIGNS wait ahead.


EXT. OASIS PROJECT HEADQUARTERS - DAY

Alice finally approaches the OASIS HEADQUARTERS.

Most of the facility is underground -- an industrial, concrete above-ground structure is the only entrance.

Alice searches for any sign of the plane -- but she doesn’t see anything. No debris, no smoke. No one is here at all.

There’s a DOORWAY to the building, but no other windows, no identifiable signs. Alice calls out:

ALICE
Hello?
(then)

Anyone?!	There’s been an accident!
 
33.


She stares at the door. She knows they’re not supposed to go inside. But she takes a breath, then a step, and pushes the door open, and suddenly--

We SMASH CUT TO Alice’s PUPIL DILATING-- then it’s--


FULL SENSORY OVERLOAD

Strobing lights-- a horrible indefinable noise-- it’s frantic and chaotic and overwhelming.

In ALICE’S POV-- colors and shapes start to come into focus-- IMAGES are being projected on the walls and on her body. She tries to move her arms but they’re being held down--

CUT TO:


INT. LIVING ROOM - ALICE AND JACK’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Lights from the TV (the original Alice in Wonderland cartoon) flash on Alice’s face as she snaps awake, SCREAMING, on the couch.

Jack runs in from the kitchen, holding a pan--

JACK
What?!	What!	Are you okay?!

Alice scrambles to her feet, pulling at her arms as if there are still ropes there. Jack drops the pan and holds her, a little freaked out--

JACK (CONT'D)
You’re okay.	Alice, honey.	HONEY.

ALICE
What happened?!

JACK
Just calm down.	You had a bad
dream.

He gently pushes her back down to the couch.

ALICE
No.	No no no--

JACK
Yes, you’re okay.

ALICE
That-- when did you get here?
 
34.


JACK
A few hours ago.	You were asleep
on the couch.	I figured you
weren’t feeling well.

ALICE
How did I get home?

JACK
The bus.

ALICE
He came out and got me?

JACK
(confused)

It took you home from town. The driver stopped by an hour ago to check on you. He said you were acting strange when he dropped you off.

ALICE
No, I got off the bus. There was a plane crash, I went to help...

JACK
A plane crash?

ALICE
I saw it--

JACK
Baby, I would’ve heard if a plane
had crashed.
(he touches her forehead)

What did you eat today?

Alice’s head is spinning.

ALICE
The driver brought me here?

JACK
Yes.	And you’ve been out like a
light since then.

Alice finally registers the pan he had been holding.

ALICE
Were you cooking?
 
35.


JACK
Well, yeah.	There was no dinner.
I had to fend for myself.
(then, admitting)

It’s a disaster. I think you might have to buy new pans.

Alice laughs despite herself and stands.

ALICE
Let me make you something.	You
must be starving.

Jack sits back, watching happily as Alice hurries into the kitchen. He calls after her:

JACK
I’d love a steak.


INT. BATHROOM - ALICE AND JACK'S HOUSE - THE NEXT DAY

Alice showers, mind wandering. She starts washing her hair, unraveling the bandage on her hand so it doesn’t get wet, stopping in her tracks when she sees--

Her cut has turned black. The skin is rotting away, revealing new skin underneath. Alice studies it, horrified--

Suddenly the shower curtain’s YANKED back. Alice jumps. Jack pokes his head in, dressed for work--

JACK
I’m heading out.	Love you.

Alice tries to hide her hand behind her. We can’t tell if Jack clocks it. She kisses him goodbye.


INT. KITCHEN - ALICE AND JACK’S HOUSE - DAY

Alice finishes re-wrapping her bandage when she hears--

BUNNY (O.S.)
Is she awake?

Alice goes to the window-- Bunny and Violet are chatting in
Bunny’s yard.	Bunny waves, calling out:

BUNNY (CONT'D)
Look who decided to join the land of the living. I heard you hit the sauce last night!
 
36.


Alice flinches, but covers, calling through the glass:

ALICE
It’s what I get for trying to keep up with y--

She stops mid-word.

There’s another plane in the sky behind Bunny and Violet. It’s faltering and dipping like the last one, plunging then desperately trying to right itself.

ALICE (CONT'D)
No...

It starts to drop out of the sky. Alice bangs on the glass, trying to get Violet and Bunny to notice, but they’re chatting obliviously.


EXT. ALICE AND JACK’S HOUSE - DAY

Bunny and Violet are back to chatting casually. The plane falls behind them. Alice bursts out of her house just as--

The plane violently plummets to the ground out in the desert, by Oasis. Alice gasps, horrified.

Bunny and Violet jump, startled, then turn behind them to where Alice is looking, but they don’t see anything. Bunny turns back, worried--

BUNNY
What?!

ALICE
You didn’t see...

Alice hesitates. Bunny and Violet search her face, concerned. For some reason, she feels exposed.

ALICE (CONT'D)
I’m sorry. I had a really weird night. I think it was a migraine, or something. And I thought I saw... Sorry.

BUNNY
(deadly serious)
Don’t lie to us.
(then)
You’re having an affair with the

bus driver.
 
37.


Violet laughs.	Alice forces a laugh.

ALICE
I tried to deny it for so long...

VIOLET
(trying too hard to get in
on the joke)

Your secret is safe with us.

Violet sees something behind Alice and her face falls.

VIOLET (CONT'D)
Does she live right behind you?

Alice and Bunny follow her gaze-- to Margaret, who’s standing in her yard just behind Alice’s.

BUNNY
Yes, lucky us.

Margaret is staring at Alice. Then she turns to look exactly where the plane just crashed.

Alice’s stomach drops.	She forces herself to look away from
Margaret, putting on a cheery face:

ALICE
Anyone headed to town?


INT. TOWN MARKET - DAY

Alice unloads her basket at the register, zoning out. She picks up a BRIGHT RED APPLE, studying its shine.

MARKET CHECKOUT LADY
Anything I can help you with?

Alice looks up at her.

ALICE
Where does this come from?

MARKET CHECKOUT LADY
The produce aisle.

ALICE
No, where does it actually come

from?

The Market Checkout Lady looks at her blankly.
 
38.


ALICE (CONT'D)
They ship all of this food in from somewhere. Where does it come from? Why can’t we grow it here?

MARKET CHECKOUT LADY
Well, we only want the best at
Oasis.	Our produce comes fresh

from all corners of the world--

ALICE
There are no living things here, at all. No food, no animals... why can’t we grow anything here?

She gestures behind her and hits a GLASS BOTTLE, which falls,
SMASHING on the ground.	Everyone turns to stare at her.
Alice reddens.	Everyone keeps staring at her.

Suddenly the market starts RUMBLING with another TREMOR. There’s a quiet ROAR of glass and tin and packaging as all the goods in the market shake.

Then the lights begin FLICKERING. Suddenly all the EMPLOYEES and CHILDREN in the store turn and look at Alice. They open their mouths HIDEOUSLY WIDE-- but instead of a scream, a terrible, screeching electronic sound comes out.

The rumbling stops even more suddenly than it started. Everyone looks normal again. The other Housewives adjust themselves, then head back to their shopping.

VOICE OVER LOUDSPEAKER (O.S.) Hold on to your hats, ladies. That was a little bigger than we’re used to. But at these prices, our Betty Crocker cake mix is gonna be flying off the shelves no matter what...

Alice leaves her basket at the register and runs outside.


INT. KITCHEN - ALICE AND JACK'S HOUSE - DAY

Alice pours herself a glass of water, trying not to freak out. She’s about to drink-- then stops, putting the glass back on the counter, staring at it. Then she looks outside.


EXT. BACKYARD - ALICE AND JACK'S HOUSE - DAY

Alice walks to the fence dividing her yard from Margaret’s.
 
39.


ALICE
Margaret?
(then)

Are you home?

She hears a strange sound. Then hears it again-- it’s coming from above. Alice looks up.

Margaret is standing on her own roof.

ALICE (CONT'D)
(alarmed)

Margaret?	What are you doing?

Margaret looks down at her. Smiles. Spreads her arms. And falls forward off the roof.

ALICE (CONT'D)
NO NO NO--

Alice flinches and turns away just as Margaret’s body lands on the spikes of the WHITE PICKET FENCE with a horrifying SQUELCH. She looks back to see the bright red blood splatters across the fence and the roses.

Alice SCREAMS.	She moves toward Margaret--

When suddenly her feet are off the ground-- a MAIL MAN has appeared and picked her up, pulling her away from the body.

Alice flails as more SERVICE MEN -- a MILK MAN, a GARBAGE MAN, a DELIVERY MAN -- suddenly appear around Margaret, tending to her, and the Mail Man drags Alice away.


INT. LIVING ROOM - ALICE AND JACK’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Alice and Jack are mid-argument.	Alice is pacing, heated.

JACK
You need to settle down--

ALICE
There is no way she’s fine!

JACK
I don’t know what to tell you! Ted’s with her at the hospital right now, he said she just needs a few stitches.

ALICE
Ted is lying to you.	She jumped.
She did it on purpose--
 
40.


JACK
She slipped cleaning the window.

It was an accident.

ALICE
Jack, I saw her.	I saw her hit
that fence.

JACK
You probably saw what you were

worried would happen--
 

ALICE
(shaking her head)
No.	No--
 


JACK (CONT'D)
She fell and you imagined the
worst case scenario--

 
ALICE (CONT'D)
I heard it!	I heard her body
break!

JACK
Please don’t get dramatic.

ALICE
She wanted me to see.

JACK
Alice, stop.

ALICE
Why would they lie about what happened? What are they hiding? There’s something off here, there’s something wrong--

JACK
Don’t do this.

ALICE
What are you doing at Oasis?

JACK
You know what I do.	I’m a
technical engineer.

ALICE
But you don’t know what they’re
doing.	What the effects of their
work might be on the people who

live here, or the land--

JACK
STOP IT.
 
41.


His tone startles her.	He’s genuinely mad.

JACK (CONT'D)
Do you know how hard I’ve worked to get here? I’m finally at the precipice of something and you are risking everything! What do you need? Attention? What more can I give you? You’re acting delusional!

He reaches for her bandage.	Alice pulls her hand away--

ALICE
No--

Jack pins her and RIPS it off to see-- the wound is gone.
Completely.	There’s no black, there’s not even a scar.

JACK
You are fine.	You’re fine.

Alice stares at it, astonished.

JACK (CONT'D)
You have to get a hold of yourself.

Do not do this to me.

He has to stop himself from going farther and marches off, pissed. Alice stands there, reeling.


INT. KITCHEN - ALICE AND JACK’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Alice stands in the kitchen in her nightgown, staring out the window toward Margaret’s house.

She walks past Jack sleeping on the couch. She stops, looks at him for a beat, and keeps going.


EXT. STREETS - NIGHT

Alice’s barefoot feet walk the empty, moonlit streets of Oasis.


EXT. HIGH DIVE - COUNTRY CLUB - NIGHT

Alice climbs the ladder to the top of the HIGH DIVE.

She reaches the top and walks carefully out to the edge of the diving board.
 
42.


She closes her eyes and spreads her arms the way Margaret did just before she jumped.

Suddenly-- the POOL LIGHTS COME ON. It startles Alice, who suddenly realizes the pool below her is empty. It’s been drained of water, it’s just a concrete pit.

She loses her balance, falling off the board-- she tumbles through the air, toward the concrete--

SMACK.


EXT. UNDERWATER - NIGHT

Alice hits the surface of the water with a violent SLAP.

She twists underwater, screaming.


EXT. COUNTRY CLUB POOL - DAY

Alice surfaces, taking in a breath. She’s just been swimming laps in the club pool. She climbs out and walks over to Bunny, Violet, Peg and Shelley and a few other HOUSEWIVES are having a boozy lunch, lounging in chairs by the pool.

PEG
...PJ still fits into the pants I

bought him last Christmas.

SHELLEY
I don’t ever want them to grow up.

This is the cutest age.

Alice takes a towel, drying herself off.

SHELLEY (CONT'D)
You’ll see, Alice.	Once you have
kids, you won’t even be able to

remember your life before them.

Bunny watches Alice cautiously as Shelley stretches luxuriously in the sun.

SHELLEY (CONT'D)
How lucky are we, ladies? Our men lug off to work all day and we get to lounge by the pool. We can’t ever let them figure out how much we’ve got it made.

The other women laugh.	Alice doesn’t.
 
43.


SHELLEY (CONT'D)
Seriously, though.	Out there, we
couldn’t live like this.	Hopefully
soon the whole world will look like
Oasis.

ALICE
Have you ever left, Shelley?

Everyone turns to Alice, surprised.

SHELLEY
What do you mean?

ALICE
Since you’ve been here.	Have you
left?	Gone on vacation?

SHELLEY
(laughs, gesturing around)

Why would I need a vacation?

PEG
Oh my God.

She points to the other side of the club. The other women jump up, squealing excitedly. At first Alice can’t see what they’re looking at, but the crowd parts and she realizes--

It’s Margaret.

And she looks completely fine. Better than fine-- sublime. She’s glowing, happy, basking in everyone’s attention, totally different from how we’ve seen her before.

Alice’s heart pounds. She grabs a towel and walks over to the crowd. Margaret’s bouncy and bright as she recounts her saga to an eager audience:

MARGARET
It was mortifying.	I tore my
dress, the mail man found me--

VIOLET
You look amazing!

MARGARET
Thank you...

Margaret stares at Violet, not remembering her.

SHELLEY
That’s Violet, honey.
 
44.


MARGARET
Violet.	Of course.
(then, apologetic)

I’m having trouble remembering, but I know I need to apologize for the way I’ve been behaving since...
(then)
Ted told me some of the things I’ve done, and--

SHELLEY
Please.	We’re just happy to have
you back.

MARGARET
Dr. Collins is a miracle worker.

Ten stitches and an icepack--

ALICE
Margaret.

She says it a little too sharply, a little too loudly. The other women jump, surprised.

ALICE (CONT'D)
Can I talk to you for a second?


AWAY FROM THE OTHERS

Alice pulls Margaret a few feet away from the other women, trying to stay calm as she whispers:

ALICE
What the hell happened?

MARGARET
I was trying to clean the outside

of our windows, like an idiot--

ALICE
Why are you acting like this?

MARGARET
Like what?

ALICE
Margaret.
(searching her face)

You jumped.

Margaret laughs.
 
45.


MARGARET
I wish I’d jumped!	I would’ve
landed better.

ALICE
You looked at me. And you hit the fence, there was blood everywhere, it wasn’t just ten stitches--

Margaret looks back at the other women and gives them a weird, almost “help me” look. That snaps something in Alice. She grabs Margaret’s arm, hard.

ALICE (CONT'D)
I know you’re lying.

MARGARET
I’m going to get some lunch--

Margaret tries to get her hand away but Alice won’t let go.
Shelley walks over, warm but discreet.

SHELLEY
Alice, are you all right?

ALICE
Tell me the truth!

A COUNTRY CLUB STAFF MEMBER approaches.

COUNTRY CLUB STAFF MEMBER Ma’am, please take this elsewhere, or we’ll be forced to call your husband.

SHELLEY
Honey, why don’t you get out of the sun for a bit. I think it’s getting to your head.

Alice realizes that everyone is watching her. Bunny gives her a “what are you doing?” look. Alice drops Margaret’s hand and clears her throat, walking away.


INT. PHONE BOOTH - COUNTRY CLUB - DAY

Alice takes a slip of paper out of her bag. It’s a phone number: “emergencies only.” Alice dials and waits as it rings, her face oddly determined. Finally someone answers:

ALICE
Jack?
 
46.


INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE - DAY

CLOSE on the DIAL of a BLOOD PRESSURE CUFF tightening around Alice’s arm. A nervous Jack and Alice sit with DR. COLLINS (50s, cheerful, patronizing).

JACK
Is there a bug going around?

DR. COLLINS
Not that I know of. I think this is just run-of-the-mill exhaustion.
(removing the cuff)
Have you had any new stresses or

pressures lately?

ALICE
No.

JACK
She saw Ted’s wife Margaret fall.

Maybe it’s shock.

DR. COLLINS
That was quite a tumble.	She was
so embarrassed.

ALICE
What exactly happened to her?

DR. COLLINS
Pardon?

ALICE
I know she got ten stitches. Where were they? Where did she hurt herself?

Dr. Collins laughs good-naturedly.

DR. COLLINS
You wouldn’t want me sharing
details of your treatment with
other patients, would you?
(then)

I’m gonna prescribe the same pills we gave you before.

ALICE
I don’t think I need those. They made me groggy. I couldn’t think.
 
47.


DR. COLLINS
They’re precautionary. To keep you calm.

JACK
How long would she have to take

them?	Just a few days?

ALICE
Could it be something in the water?

DR. COLLINS
(a beat)

The water?

ALICE
Or the air?	Or whatever causes
those earthquakes?

Dr. Collins just watches her for a beat.	Then:

DR. COLLINS
Hmm.

ALICE
What?

DR. COLLINS
Margaret asked me that same

question.

His voice technically sounds the same, but something in the room has shifted.

DR. COLLINS (CONT'D) She was also having trouble sleeping. Are you having any trouble sleeping? Any bad dreams?

He clicks his pen to take notes. Alice steals a glance at Jack. They’re both suddenly on high alert. A record of Alice behaving like Margaret isn’t something either of them want.

ALICE
No.	Nothing like that.
(then, carefully)
You’re probably right.	I’m most
likely just exhausted.

Dr. Collins pats her knee.
 
48.


DR. COLLINS
We’re gonna get you squared away.
(standing)
You two lovebirds wait here and
I’ll grab your medication.	Nurse

Collins will drive you home.

NURSE COLLINS, Dr. Collins’s Head Nurse and wife, appears behind Dr. Collins, smiling happily.


INT. NURSE COLLINS’S CAR/EXT. STREET - DAY

Alice sits in the backseat, head against the window, as Nurse Collins gets in the front seat. She sits up when she sees--

Jack, arguing with Dr. Collins in the parking lot. She unrolls her window, just able to faintly hear:

DR. COLLINS
You’re being reckless.

JACK
It’s not necessary!

Nurse Collins turns the ENGINE on, drowning out the conversation. Alice tries to open the door, but it’s locked.

ALICE
I need to hop out for a second.

NURSE COLLINS
(pleasantly)

Dr. Collins said I was to take you straight home.

ALICE
It’s important, I need to ask my

husband something.

Alice yanks at the door.	Nurse Collins just smiles.

NURSE COLLINS
Rest and relaxation, that’s what

you need.

ALICE
Please.	Please let me out--

NURSE COLLINS
Doctor’s orders!

She drives away.	Alice turns around to watch Jack and Dr.
Collins continue arguing as they get smaller in the distance.
 
49.


EXT. ALICE AND JACK’S HOUSE - DAY

Alice walks up to her front door. Nurse Collins waits in her car, watching. She doesn’t pull away until Alice is inside.

EXT. BACKYARD - ALICE AND JACK'S HOUSE - DAY

Alice stands in her backyard, staring at Margaret’s roof. She walks over toward the fence where Margaret fell. There’s no blood, no marking, no evidence at all. Maybe she did imagine it.

She reaches out and touches the fence-- and when she brings her fingers back, they’re covered in wet, white paint.

The fence has been repainted.

Alice stumbles back.	She wasn’t crazy.

She turns to look toward Oasis. Then she walks over to Bunny’s yard, trying to seem casual, eyes darting around to make sure she’s not being watched.

One of Bunny’s kids BIKES has been discarded in the yard. Alice picks it up and is about to swing her leg over it when--

BUNNY’S SON FRED (O.S.)
(singing)

Merrily merrily merrily merrily...

Bunny’s son Fred is swinging on their swing set, his back to
Alice, singing the same line over and over:

BUNNY’S SON FRED (CONT'D)
(singing)

Merrily merrily merrily merrily...

Alice looks around, but it seems like no one else is home.
Fred’s alone.	Alice approaches him, uneasy.

ALICE
Honey?	Where’s your mom?

BUNNY’S SON FRED
(singing)

Merrily merrily merrily merrily...

ALICE
Fred--

She touches his shoulder to stop him swinging. He turns to her-- and his mouth opens in a horrifying scream, emitting the same terrible electronic screech she heard in the market.
 
50.


Alice staggers back. He reaches for her hand sweetly, but Alice backs away, scared, and jumps on the bike, furiously pedaling away.


EXT. ROAD - DAY

Alice bikes down the empty road toward Oasis Headquarters, the town disappearing behind her.


EXT. OASIS HEADQUARTERS - DAY

Alice pedals on dead-tired legs, finally here. She drops the bike, it’s wheels still spinning on the ground.

She walks up to the doorway. She looks around, takes a deep breath, steels herself, and pushes the door open and we SMASH CUT TO--

HER PUPIL DILATING --


AND IT’S SENSORY OVERLOAD AGAIN

We’re in ALICE’S POV-- the lights are too bright, moving and flashing-- everything’s too loud--

Then lights and colors start to come into focus. She slowly takes in her surroundings. IMAGES are being projected on to Alice and the PLASTIC CURTAINS surrounding what feels like a little corner of the room.

She’s lying on a bed, in a white nightgown. She’s paler, gaunt, not in 50’s style. Two IV’s run from her arm to a simple machine with an elegant screen. She slowly sits up, blinking in the chaos of the images, trying to make them out.

Some of them are 1950’s advertisements: A man blowing cigarette smoke into an eager woman’s face: Blow in her face and she’ll follow you anywhere. A husband hugging his embarrassed wife: Don’t Worry Darling, You Didn’t Burn the Beer! A wife bent over her husband’s knee, his arm raised to spank her: If he finds out you didn’t buy Sanborn!

The ceiling is covered in moving black-and-white patterns-- which she realizes are Busby Berkeley dancers. These are the same dancers from her dreams.

Alice’s head spins. She struggles to move, like a fawn discovering its limbs. She’s restrained by the IV’s in her arm and another cord-- running up to a small white implant attached to her skull, just under her ear.
 
51.


Alice pulls at the cords, alarmed. Then she notices an elegant IPAD-LIKE DEVICE resting on top of the machine she’s connected to. She picks it up-- it’s monitoring information of some kind. It looks medical.

In the corner is a photo of...herself? A small one, like an Avatar. She looks different in a way she can’t describe.

She touches it-- and the screen CHANGES. Two photos show up, a MAN and WOMAN, captioned “NEW USERS: BOB AND KATHY.” Alice stares at the device like it’s witchcraft.

She touches it again-- and a VIDEO starts playing. It’s the tourism video from the opening, just where we left it: a group of FRIENDS drinking and laughing by the pool, just as Frank walks onscreen. Alice jumps back at the sight of him.

FRANK
It may be remote, but we have a
feeling that once you arrive,
you’ll never want to leave.
(then)

Your acceptance into this brotherhood is no small feat. You’ve passed multiple background and psychological tests, and have proven your dedication and loyalty to our cause and way of life.

Alice looks around the room, panicking. Where the fuck is she? She studies the machine -- it’s too hard to read, DOTS and charts everywhere--

FRANK (CONT'D)
But this acceptance is not tenured. There are rules, and punishments if you or your loved one breaks those rules. You can move up in our organization by recruiting others to join our community--

She tries to stand, but her legs are so weak that when she puts pressure on her right foot, her ankle TWISTS. She falls, hitting her head on the machine behind her on the way down and PASSING OUT COLD as we CUT TO--


UNDERWATER

The rippling surface of a body of water.

REVEAL Alice is underwater, eyes wide, terrified. She opens her mouth to breath, realizes she can’t, and sits up--
 
52.


INT. BATHROOM - ALICE AND JACK’S HOUSE - NIGHT

In her bathtub, gasping for a breath. She pants, choking on air, fighting tears as she feels her body, tries to understand where she is and what just happened--

A happy Jack enters, in a TUXEDO, buttoning his cuffs--

JACK
I might ask Shelley to dance at some point, if it feels like the--

He stops, surprised, when he sees her in the tub.

JACK (CONT'D)
How long do you need to get ready?

We’re gonna be late.

Alice catches her breath, leaning back, covering her face.
She manages to nod.	Jack takes her in, still awed by her.

JACK (CONT'D)
You look incredible.
(then, mischievous)
I’ve been thinking we should try

something kind of crazy.

He squeezes her thigh, rubs his hand down it. Alice can’t even think about sex right n--

JACK (CONT'D)
Let’s have a baby.

He couldn’t have stunned her more if he’d smacked her.

ALICE
What?

JACK
I mean, not right this second, obviously, we don’t have time. But...I love you, and I want more of you, and now I think I want a little you. I don’t know. It’d be an adventure.

He stands and starts to leave, then stops, remembering:

JACK (CONT'D)
Oh, here.

He hands her -- a pill. Alice stares at him for a beat, then takes it and puts it in her mouth.
 
53.


As soon as he’s gone, she spits out the pill and pulls the bath’s plug, letting it dissolve as the water drains.

She submerges herself back underwater as we CUT TO--


A SINGER’S FACE

On stage, in a spotlight, performing into a microphone. We are...


INT. “DOLL HOUSE” NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

This is the biggest event of the year-- a boisterous, rowdy black tie affair. The whole town is here, drinking and dancing and letting loose.

A classic 50’s BIG BAND, led by the singer, plays in the iconic CLAMSHELL stage in front of a small dance floor, the rest of the room filled with beautifully-set tables.

Alice and Jack walk in. Alice is overwhelmed by the room-- everything is too loud, too much. She clutches Jack’s arm, trying not to panic, anxious and paranoid.


AT THEIR TABLE

Alice and Jack arrive to cheers from Bunny and Dean, Peg and Peter, and Violet and Bill. This is the fun table, already deep into their drinks. Peter and Peg dance in place as Bunny has Violet twirl to show off her dress:

BUNNY
How good does that look on her?!
Bill better watch out.	It fits

better than it did in the store!

Violet blushes, pleased, as Peg looks between them:

PEG
You guys went shopping together?
All of you?	As a group?
(too brightly)

That’s fun.

Dean is making Bill chug from a bottle of champagne. He chokes on the bubbles but keeps going, spilling on his shirt. Jack cheers him on as he hands Alice a glass of champagne. She takes it just to hold something, as--

SHELLEY (O.S.)
Here are the troublemakers.
 
54.


Shelley walks up, making the rounds.

SHELLEY (CONT'D)
I don’t know how we’re allowed to

put you all at one table.

JACK
It’s probably better for insurance purposes.

Shelley touches Alice’s arm softly.

SHELLEY
Alice, how are you feeling?

Shelley says it pleasantly, but it feels loaded.

ALICE
I’m great.

SHELLEY
If I hear glass breaking, I’m

coming right here.

Everybody laughs too hard as Shelley moves on to the next table. Alice watches her go-- then sees Margaret, giggling and flirting with Ted, charming everyone at their table. Ted’s beaming, relaxed, back in everyone’s good graces.

She watches Margaret kiss Ted on the cheek and walk over to the BAR. Alice turns to Jack, shouting over the music:

ALICE
I’ll be right back.


BY THE BAR

Margaret takes two drinks from the bartender just as Alice walks up behind her. Margaret turns and sees her, trapped.

MARGARET
Oh, hi.	I’m just going to bring
these back to Ted--

ALICE
You can tell me whatever’s going

on.

Alice is trying to look her in the eye, but Margaret won’t hold her gaze.
 
55.


ALICE (CONT'D)
(quietly)
I do have bad dreams.	I know
they’re hiding something.	I know
something’s out there.	What are

they making you cover up?

Margaret’s looking at Alice the way they all used to look at Margaret: like her crazy might be contagious.

MARGARET
I need to go find my husband.

Margaret walks away. Alice turns back to see Jack has been watching the whole thing. He looks disconcerted.

Suddenly the BAND PLAYS A HEROIC CUE... because Frank has walked on stage, taking the mic to say a few words. Alice walks back to her table, sitting close to Jack.

FRANK
Just wanted to say thank you to
everyone for coming out.	This is
my favorite night of the year.	I
love being all together under one
roof, I love seeing who can no
longer fit in their tuxedos, but
mostly I love looking back on how
far we’ve come.

Alice looks around the room. Everyone is watching Frank with total devotion. They’re all enraptured.

FRANK (CONT'D)
It’s amazing to see how much we’ve grown. And I’m happy to say that we’re still growing, even tonight. We’ve set the bar terribly high for their first night in town, but I’d like to take this opportunity to introduce our newest hire and his beautiful wife, Bob and Kathy King.

An elated man, BOB, and his sheepish wife, KATHY, walk out, holding hands, waving to everyone. The room applauds warmly.

Alice’s stomach drops.

These are the people from the “NEW USER” photo she saw.

Alice grabs Jack’s arm, hard.

ALICE
Jack, I need to go home.
 
56.


JACK
What?	We just got here.

FRANK
(to Bob and Kathy)

Welcome to Oasis. We do this every Saturday.

The crowd LAUGHS -- and suddenly they all have no teeth. It looks horrifying. Alice is spinning out. She squeezes her eyes shut-- when they open, everyone looks normal again. She grabs Jack again--

ALICE
We need to get out of here.

JACK
We’ll get you a drink...

Frank’s watching them.	He grins.

FRANK
Now, if I could have Jack come up

here for a minute.

Jack blinks, startled. Their whole table is amazed. Alice grabs his hand, distressed, whispering to him--

ALICE
Please.	Please let’s just go.

Jack looks from Alice to Frank, beckoning him on stage. He looks at her like “what am I supposed to do?” Then pulls his hand away, jumping to his feet and hurrying to the stage.

ALICE (CONT'D)
(desperate)

Jack...

Alice watches helplessly as Jack hops on stage next to Frank.
He’s blushing, jittery with nerves.

FRANK
Bob’s going to have big shoes to
fill.	He’ll be taking over for
Jack, as I’m pleased to announce
that Jack is being promoted to

Senior Technology Manager.

Their table erupts in CHEERS. Jack shakes Frank’s hand, giddy. Alice starts hyperventilating. She can’t catch her breath. She runs out of the room. Bunny watches, concerned.
 
57.


INT. BATHROOM - "DOLL HOUSE" NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

Alice pushes open the bathroom door, still gasping. A beat later Bunny follows her in--

BUNNY
What has gotten into you? Jack-- Alice grabs her, wild and desperate.
ALICE
Something bad is happening.
Something is deeply, deeply wrong
with this town.	And with Frank.
Oasis is doing something wrong or

it’s covering up something wrong--

Bunny’s momentarily stunned by Alice’s intensity.

BUNNY
Okay, slow down--


INT. “DOLL HOUSE” NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

Back in the main room, Frank still has Jack on stage.

FRANK
Now, I heard there’s a special way

Jack likes to celebrate good news.

The band starts playing a SONG.	Jack laughs, embarrassed--

JACK
No.	No way...

FRANK
I’ve heard you’re the best...

Jack shakes his head, secretly loving this. Then he starts to tap dance to the music. His table ERUPTS, delighted. Jack begins to perform a full choreography. He keeps an eye on Frank, desperate to please him. Frank watches happily.

Alice is exploding with everything she’s been holding in, frantically trying to explain
