ALICE
I went to Oasis--
 
58.


BUNNY
What do you mean you went there?
 

ALICE
And when I walked inside I woke up somewhere else.
 


BUNNY (CONT'D) You walked inside? What are you talking about?!

 
ALICE (CONT'D)
It wasn’t even inside, I woke up in another room. And I was connected to a machine, like it was an experiment, and there was a video with Frank, Frank was there, and there was a photo of that couple out there and it said “new users”--

Bunny takes her hand, trying to calm her down.

BUNNY
That was probably a dream.	Jack
must’ve mentioned the new couple,
or you saw a photo of them and

didn’t remember--

ALICE
Margaret should not be okay and
she’s acting like she’s fine and

they’re all covering it up.

Bunny’s starting to get scared for her friend.


INT. “DOLL HOUSE" NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

Jack keeps dancing, really throwing himself into it, sweating and struggling a bit. Frank watches from the side.


INT. BATHROOM - "DOLL HOUSE" NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

ALICE
I think Frank brought us all here.

BUNNY
Of course he did, he hired--

ALICE
No! It’s something else. I think he brought us here for another reason. We can’t trust him.

BUNNY
Honey...
 
59.


ALICE
I know it sounds insane.	I know
how it sounds.	But you have to
believe me.	Bunny.	You have to.

Alice is getting louder.	Bunny tries to quiet her--

BUNNY
Alice, Frank and Shelley are just

outside--

ALICE
Come with me right now and I’ll

show you.	I’ll prove it.

BUNNY
Come with you-- to the

headquarters?!


INT. “DOLL HOUSE" NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

Jack’s sweating, he’s dancing so hard. The whole place is impressed-- but Jack is just watching Frank to see if he’s happy. Frank grins.


INT. BATHROOM - "DOLL HOUSE" NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

ALICE
I can show you what happened--
 

BUNNY
You can’t do that.
ALICE

We could take Jack’s car, no one would notice--
 




BUNNY (CONT'D) Absolutely not, there’s no way in--

 
ALICE (CONT'D)
You have to come with me so I can show you. You have to believe me.

BUNNY
It’s way too dangerous--

A WOMAN walks in and Bunny immediately quiets. The Woman walks past and Alice grips her hands, desperate.

ALICE
Bunny, please. Please. I’m begging you. I can prove it. I’ll show you--
 
60.


BUNNY
(trying to quiet her)

Alice--

ALICE
(loud)

You have to let me show you.

BUNNY
We can go home--

ALICE
I’m going either way.	Right now.


INT. “DOLL HOUSE" NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

Jack ends his dance with a FLOURISH, panting. The whole place CHEERS. Frank throws an arm around him proudly. This is the best night of Jack’s night.

At their table, Bunny appears behind Dean, kissing his neck. He reaches around to grab her ass as she slips a hand inside his jacket, pulling out his CAR KEYS.


INT. DEAN’S CAR/EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

A very nervous Bunny drives Alice down the empty, scary road.
Their headlights are the only source of light for miles.


INT. “DOLL HOUSE” NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

Frank still has his arm around Jack onstage.

FRANK
This is why tonight is my favorite night of the year. You’re all extraordinary. This is a brotherhood of brilliance. Never forget that.


INT. DEAN’S CAR/EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

Alice keeps checking behind them to see if they’re being followed. Bunny’s gripping the wheel, terrified.

ALICE
Turn your headlights off.

Bunny groans as she looks for the headlight switch -- but she turns them off and they’re enveloped in darkness.
 
61.


INT. “DOLL HOUSE” NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

The crowd is riveted by Frank. Jack doesn’t take his eyes off of him.

FRANK
We’re here because we know we don’t need to heed what the rest of the world convinces itself is important or right. You all worked so hard to get here, and I picked each of you. I chose you. And not just because of your talent and drive, but because of the dedication you demonstrate to our cause.

The men CHEER, ignited. Even Violet looks emotional. Dean looks around, searching for Bunny.


EXT. OASIS HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

They pull up to the lobby, moonlight illuminating: the door now has a HUGE LOCK on it. Alice steps out of the car, incredulous. Bunny steps out after her.

BUNNY
Was that not there before?
(then)

That’s a sign, Alice. We should go before Dean realizes--

Alice walks to the back of the car. She opens the trunk and takes out a CROWBAR.

BUNNY (CONT'D)
(alarmed)

Alice...

Alice walks up to the door and HITS THE LOCK as hard as she can. Bunny jumps.


INT. “DOLL HOUSE" NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

Frank’s electric onstage.

FRANK
We’re changing the world. You’re changing the world. And we cannot take our foot off the gas.
 
62.


EXT. OASIS HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

Alice hits it again, and again, over and over, wailing on it, taking out all her anxiety and stress--

CLANK. It breaks. Alice drops the crow bar, out of breath, and turns back to a truly stunned Bunny.

ALICE
It’s going to be intense. It takes a minute to adjust. Just stay calm and push through the beginning.

Bunny nods, nervous. Alice grabs her hand, clutching it tightly, and pushes the door open, entering--


INT. OASIS HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

...the Oasis lobby. There’s no blinding light or crazy noises or sensory deprivation: they’re just inside the dark, clinical LOBBY of a government building.

Bunny walks in after her, footsteps echoing as she takes in the empty FRONT DESK and frozen ESCALATORS leading below.

Alice can’t believe it.	She walks outside to try again--

ALICE
Come back out.	Maybe we didn’t--

BUNNY
Alice.

ALICE
(realizing)

Frank did this.

BUNNY
STOP.

Alice stops. Bunny grabs her hand and looks her in the eye, empathetic but firm--

BUNNY (CONT'D)
You need to get a hold of yourself.

ALICE
This isn’t--

BUNNY
Listen to me.	I love you, and I
believe that you’ve seen things.

(MORE)
 
63.

BUNNY (CONT'D)
But I think you should start taking the pills again and see--

ALICE
It’s not like last time--

BUNNY
We should not be here.	You
shouldn’t have dragged me into
this.	I’m leaving and you’re
coming with me.	Get in the car.

Bunny walks back out to the car, picking up the discarded crowbar on her way.

Alice stands in the middle of the empty lobby, reeling.


INT. KITCHEN - ALICE AND JACK’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Alice, in a nightgown, flips through a PHOTO ALBUM at the kitchen table. Photos of their WEDDING, she and Jack posing on vacation, in love... she turns a page, then turns it back. It’s a photo of her and Jack at Niagara Falls.

It looks exactly like the photo of Frank and Shelley and the photo of Peter and Peg at Niagara Falls.


INT. KITCHEN - ALICE AND JACK’S HOUSE - THE NEXT DAY

Alice is back in the routine-- EGGS cracked, BACON frying, a TOMATO sliced, COFFEE poured--

Alice presents the cup of coffee to Jack, who’s still high off of last night.

ALICE
I’m sorry I went home early last

night.

JACK
I’m sorry for you that you missed

my dance.

ALICE
I’m sorry, in general. I know it was an opportunity to impress Frank and I...I just haven’t been myself lately. But I know how to make it up to you. I invited Dean and Bunny and Bill and Violet and the new couple to dinner tonight. And Frank and Shelley are coming, too.
 
64.


Jack almost spits out his coffee.

JACK
Frank is coming here?

ALICE
I told him we wanted to welcome Bob and Kathy to the neighborhood. We can blow it out, cook a delicious meal, show them what great hosts we are, what a great couple we are.

Alice walks around the table to sit on his lap.

ALICE (CONT'D)
Let me do this for you.

She kisses him, then swings her leg around to straddle him. Jack breaks the kiss to check his watch--

JACK
What time is it?	I don’t--

Alice kisses him again. She’s turning this from a goodbye kiss into sex.

ALICE
We’re a team, right?

JACK
Always.

She pins his hands to the chair.

ALICE
I love you.

He’s surprised, but not not into it, as she takes control.

JACK
I love you.

ALICE
You and me.

JACK
Yes.	You and me.

She kisses him.


INT. BATHROOM - ALICE AND JACK'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Alice puts on her makeup like it’s war paint.
 
65.


She stares at herself in the mirror for a beat.


INT. FOYER/DINING ROOM - ALICE AND JACK’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Alice looks incredible, done up to the nines, holding a tray of CIGARETTES. A BEAUTIFUL dinner spread’s on the table, MARTINIS lined up ready to be handed out.

Jack opens the door to Dean and Bunny, taking their coats.
Bill and Violet walk in behind them, awed.

ALICE
Welcome, boys.

DEAN
Look at you.

Dean takes a cigarette and leans over to Jack--

DEAN (CONT'D)
How the hell did you get him to

come to your house?

Bunny keeps a cautious eye on Alice as they hug, whispering:

BUNNY
What’s going on?

ALICE
A dinner party.	Who wants a drink?

VIOLET
Alice, I adore what you’ve done

with this place!

Bob and Kathy follow them, timid but excited:

BOB
Thanks so much for having us.

We’re thrilled to be included.

BILL
All right, calm down, Bob, you

already got the job.

Bill winks at Dean, who rolls his eyes-- as Frank and Shelley walk in. They immediately own the room.

FRANK
Jack, this is lovely.
 
66.


JACK
(chest puffed out)

Thank you.	Thank you for coming.

SHELLEY
And it smells amazing!

JACK
It usually does.	I’m a lucky guy.
(then)
Let me take your coats.	What can
we get you to drink?


INT. KITCHEN - ALICE AND JACK'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Alice prepares appetizers in the kitchen, chopping, planning, until--

FRANK (O.S.)
I learned something very exciting.

Frank is standing in her kitchen. He pops an appetizer in his mouth and leans against the counter casually. Alice puts on a calm, chipper face.

ALICE
(brightly)

What do you mean?

FRANK
Rumor is that you and Jack are

trying.

It takes all of Alice’s effort to keep her face bright.

ALICE
Well, we’ll see.

FRANK
I also heard you and Bunny took a

little trip last night.

Alice stops dead.	Frank just grins at her.

FRANK (CONT'D)
Don’t worry.	You’re not in
trouble.
(then)

I’m sorry it was just the boring lobby. But I couldn’t let you exit three times.
 
67.


He grins and pops another appetizer in his mouth as Alice’s insides go cold. He studies her face, intrigued.

FRANK (CONT'D)
No one else has ever tried. Or even asked the questions. I’ve been waiting for someone like you.
(then)
And yet you’re still in here, preparing dinner, like a good girl.

He shrugs.	Before Alice can respond, Shelley walks in.

SHELLEY
There you are! You have to see the rest of the house. It’s so cute.

FRANK
Take me on a tour.

SHELLEY
What a perfect starter home.	And
plenty of space to grow...

She winks at Alice as they walk out.	Alice stands there.


INT. DINING ROOM - ALICE AND JACK'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Everyone’s still laughing and talking as they take their seats to eat. Jack pulls the chair at the head of the table out for Frank to sit, then hurries over to the other head of the table. He pulls a chair out for himself--

But Alice slides into it, sitting at the head. Jack’s startled. Everyone else exchanges glances, alarmed.

Alice just stares at Frank as Jack awkwardly takes the seat beside her. Dean tries to start up the conversation again.

DEAN
Anyway, then I bet Jack that he

couldn’t.	A gentleman’s bet--

JACK
He always exaggerates this part.

You can’t believe a word he says--

Alice keeps watching Frank.	Getting more determined.

BUNNY
He only really inflates stories

about his golf scores.
 
68.
 


JACK
That is blasphemous--
 



VIOLET
Bill does that too!

 
ALICE
Kathy, where are you from?

It cuts through all the other conversation. Kathy’s a little startled to be put in the spotlight.

KATHY
Pardon?

Alice looks at her warmly.

ALICE
Where are you from?

BOB
Philadelphia.

VIOLET
(delighted)

I’m from Philadelphia!

Alice doesn’t look away from Kathy.

ALICE
Everyone here is from Philadelphia, or Baltimore, or Boston. Every once and awhile, Chicago. Where did you vacation last?

Kathy looks at Bob.

KATHY
Vacation?

JACK
Is everybody good on drinks?

ALICE
I could probably guess.

She points to framed PHOTOS on the wall.

ALICE (CONT'D)
One of those places.	Right?

The husbands exchange looks. Jack her a look, like “what the hell are you doing?”

JACK
Honey, maybe you want to lay down--
 
69.


A smiling Frank holds up a hand, quieting him.

FRANK
I’m curious where she’s going with this.

Alice is trying to talk directly to the women, even as they avoid her eyes.

ALICE
We all share the same four or five memories. It’s like there are different tracks. We honeymooned in Sea Island, or the Poconos, or Niagara Falls.

BILL
(trying to help)

I think those are popular honeymoon destinations...

ALICE
Violet, where did you meet Bill?

Violet’s nervous, she doesn’t want to answer, but she does:

VOILET
On a train--
 

VIOLET
 


ALICE

 
To Boston.
 

To Boston.

 
ALICE (CONT'D)
You dropped your ticket and he
picked it up and gave it to you.
(then)

That’s how Peg met Peter. And how Debbie McIntyre met her husband. There are only so many different stories we’re told. We’re told what we remember. We’re given those memories.

FRANK
Is memory problems a symptom you’ve experienced before, Alice?

He’s almost...energized. Ready for a challenge. Alice ignores him, trying to make eye contact with the women--

ALICE
Try and remember something from
before you came to Oasis.

Something that’s just yours.
 
70.


FRANK
A symptom of your other issues?

Jack stares at his plate, his leg bouncing rapidly, trying not to panic.

FRANK (CONT'D)
Dr. Collins prescribed you
something for your mental health,

didn’t he?

ALICE
To distract me.	Because I was
realizing the truth.

JACK
(pleading, quietly)

Alice...

FRANK
Because you’ve been having trouble conceiving?

Suddenly-- A BABY’S CRY. Coming from the bedroom. No one else reacts-- no one else can hear it. Only Frank looks toward it. He grins and it stops.

Alice turns to the men:

ALICE
He’s lying to you. He’s using you. You don’t even know what he’s doing there. I’ve seen it, I went to Oasis--

The men all look at Frank, disturbed and alarmed. Jack looks like he’s going to be sick.

JACK
What?

ALICE
And I saw that this isn’t real.

FRANK
What does that even mean?

She points to Bob and Kathy.

ALICE
I saw them before they got here.
It’s all planned.	It’s fake.

Nothing in this place--
 
71.


FRANK
This is all fake?	The food we’re
eating?	Am I fake?

ALICE
I saw what he created, where he

keeps us--

FRANK
I just want to follow your logic. Everything we’re seeing doesn’t exist. The townspeople, the houses, the children! The children aren’t real.

Everyone stops.	Bunny finally looks up.

FRANK (CONT'D)
Are Bunny’s children real?

ALICE
He’s trying to turn us against each other--

FRANK
They’re not, right? If this is all some fake, alternate universe? Otherwise it doesn’t make sense.

ALICE
Try and remember anything outside
of this.	Anything besides what

Frank has told you--

FRANK
I’ve invented all of this, so

Bunny’s children aren’t real.

ALICE
Yes, because none of it--

BUNNY
ENOUGH.

Bunny looks up at Alice, hard.	Then:

BUNNY (CONT'D)
Dean, I’m ready to go.

For once, Dean is speechless. He stands and hurries to follow Bunny out the door.

FRANK
Have a good night, Bunny.
 
72.


ALICE
Bunny-- please-- this is what he’s trying to do--

FRANK
I don’t know why she’s so upset

with me...

CRASH. Alice angrily shoves her plate and glassware off the table, shattering on the ground. The others jump, startled.

A beat.

FRANK (CONT'D)
Jack, I think you may have over-

served your wife.

Jack stands so quickly he almost knocks his chair over.

JACK
Yes, I think-- Thanks for coming--

The others jump to their feet, desperate to escape. They avoid eye contact as they hurry to the door. Frank just sits, watching Alice, almost pleased. She’s shaking.

Finally Frank stands and calmly walks out behind the others.


INT. DINING ROOM - ALICE AND JACK’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Alice hasn’t moved from the table. She hears Jack saying goodbye to the last guests, murmuring apologies. Then the sound of the door closing. Jack stomps back in-- for maybe the first time, he’s truly angry at her.

JACK
What the fuck was that?

ALICE
I wanted to tell you--

JACK
Are you trying to get me fired?!
Do you want me to lose my job?	I

can’t-- I don’t even--

ALICE
Jack, I need you--

JACK
You went to Oasis?!	Do you have
any idea how dangerous that is?
 
73.


Alice grabs him, the truth spilling out.

ALICE
I saw a plane crash. I saw a plane crash in the desert and I went to help and there was no one there, I was looking for help, and that’s when you found me on the couch.

JACK
(realizing)

That was a week ago! How could you hide that from me?!

ALICE
And since then it’s like this reality is falling apart. And last week I went again and I saw it, I saw whatever Frank is doing, he’s trapping us here. This town is rotten, the children and the employees, their faces disappear, it’s like I can see through them--

Jack falls into a chair, rubbing his head.

JACK
Honey.	Honey...

ALICE
Jack, what do they do?	What does
Oasis do?

JACK
I don’t know. I don’t know what they do. No one does. We all have a specific role, but we don’t....

She takes his head in her hands, distraught.

ALICE
Please, baby. I need you. I need you to believe me.

Jack studies her face.	He’s almost crying.

JACK
Okay.

ALICE
...okay?
 
74.


JACK
I believe you.	I love you.	So I
believe you.

Alice releases a breath that’s almost a sob, she’s so relieved. She throws her arms around him.

JACK (CONT'D)
You should have told me...

ALICE
I’m sorry.	I’m sorry--

He pulls back, distressed.

JACK
Am I trapped?

ALICE
What?

JACK
I work at Oasis, I live here.	But
I go into that building every day.
I do whatever Frank wants me to do.

Am I helping him?

Alice takes his hand, sad but determined.

ALICE
Yes. I think you all are, without even realizing--

JACK
Then what do we do?

ALICE
We have to go. We have to get out of here.

Jack looks sick, but he nods.

JACK
Okay.	Let’s go.

ALICE
Okay?

JACK
We should go tonight.

ALICE
Let’s go right now.
 
75.


She jumps to her feet, fueled by Jack and finally having a plan. Jack grabs her and kisses her hard.


INT. JACK’S CAR - NIGHT

Alice SLAMS the passenger door, checking to make sure no one’s seen them--

Jack jumps in the driver’s seat and turns on the car on, their headlights illuminating the house--

But then he just sits there.	Alice looks at him.

ALICE
Jack.

He’s not moving.

JACK
I’m sorry.

ALICE
What?

He starts crying.

JACK
I love you so much.	I tried so
hard to keep this from happening.

ALICE
(getting scared)

Jack...

JACK
Please try to remember me, and what we had.

The light from the headlights flickers.	Alice turns--

All of the other husbands are standing in front of their car.

Alice SCREAMS as the men move methodically, surrounding the car. Alice unbuckles and tries to escape through the backseat but they open the door and grab her, dragging her out as she tries to fight back. Jack just cries in the driver’s seat.

CUT TO:
 
76.


INT. 1950’S HOSPITAL - NIGHT

Alice is strapped to a GURNEY, struggling weakly, clearly drugged. MALE DOCTORS surround her, preparing to perform ELECTRIC SHOCK THERAPY.

The charge BUILDS and she’s SHOCKED--

And we see a FLASH of something-- Alice using an ELECTRIC KEYCARD to BEEP herself past security.

She’s SHOCKED--

And we see another flash-- Alice staring at herself in a metal reflection, looking totally different--

She’s SHOCKED-- and she looks up to see--

A FEMALE DOCTOR in a mask, staring down at her. The doctor sighs and pulls the mask down-- it’s Alice. A very 21st-century Alice, in scrubs, looking defeated.

ALICE
Fuck.

Alice tosses her mask on the ground and marches out of the OPERATING ROOM. She BEEPS her keycard to walk through a secure door and we follow her into the--


HOSPITAL HALLWAY

It’s a windowless, chaotic, grimy hospital. NURSES and other doctors step aside or quiet as she passes, clearly intimidated by her. An INTERN attempts to catch up with her--

HOSPITAL INTERN
Dr. Williams, we’ve got two more

GSW’s on their way in.

ALICE
I’ve already done five today.	Find
Feldstein.

HOSPITAL INTERN
He asked us to ask you--

Alice steps on to an open ELEVATOR.

ALICE
I’ve been on for 36 hours.	I’m
done.	Find Feldstein.
 
77.


INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

As soon as the doors close, Alice’s shoulders collapse. She undoes her ponytail, rubs her temples, stressed and overwhelmed. She doesn’t even notice that someone else is in the elevator -- a schlubby PHARMACEUTICAL REP standing behind a cart of products in the corner. We don’t fully see him, but we can sense he’s watching her. Finally:

PHARMACEUTICAL REP
Crazy day?

Alice gives him a polite smile -- the smile you give someone you see every day, but don’t have any desire to know.

ALICE
Always.

He hangs on her every word.	She doesn’t notice.

PHARMACEUTICAL REP
You work too hard.

Alice has turned back to her phone.

PHARMACEUTICAL REP (CONT'D) You need somebody to take care of you.

She doesn’t respond. She’s reading something. Maybe she didn’t hear him, maybe she’s pretending she didn’t.

DING. The elevator reaches her floor. He knows it’s where she gets off, that their time is up.

PHARMACEUTICAL REP (CONT'D)
I’ll see you tomorrow.

Alice waves, still distracted by her phone.

ALICE
Yep.

She steps off the elevator and we finally see him -- 21st century Jack -- watching her, unblinking, until the doors close.


INT. 1950’S HOSPITAL - NIGHT

One final SHOCK-- and Alice goes limp on the gurney.
 
78.


The doctors calmly roll her gurney out of the room, past the old-fashioned machines.

CUT TO:


INT. STAIRWELL - DAY

We’re following a MAN, close on his back, as he climbs the dark, drab stairs. He’s in a WINTER COAT and WHISTLING the same tune we’ve heard Alice whistle. We stay right on his shoulder as he throws open a DOOR and continues down an--


APARTMENT HALLWAY

He pulls out a key and opens the door to 10B, walking into--


AN APARTMENT

We’re still behind him as he tosses his key into a dish by the door and moves his way through the barren, modest home.

He reaches a bedroom door with an intense, high-tech ELECTRIC KEYPAD. It’s out of place in the rest of the plain apartment. He types in a CODE and the door CLICKS open to a--


BEDROOM

We finally swing around to see this man from the front...
it’s 21st-century Jack.

He’s still whistling as he passes an empty chair with an IPAD resting on it to Alice’s and keeps walking toward an area curtained-off in THICK PLASTIC CURTAINS. Familiar images and SOUNDS blare behind them. He pulls back the curtains--

An unconscious Alice lays on the bed we’ve seen her wake from. Jack turns off the VIDEOS so she’s laying in silence.

Jack picks up the iPad with Alice’s avatar and clicks something. A message pops up: REBOOT 100% DOWNLOADED. READY FOR FULL RESET.

Across the room, Alice’s eyes open. She’s awake. She struggles to move, but she can’t. Her eyes dart around the room, desperate. She watches Jack work the iPad as he WHISTLES that same tune. He turns back-- she closes her eyes, pretending to be unconscious again.

Jack stands over her, studying her. He looks almost crestfallen. Then he grabs both of her legs.
 
79.


He slowly starts moving them in circles, as if she was pedaling a bike -- he’s stretching her muscles.

JACK
I’m so sorry, baby. You’ll remember the essentials. And we’ll get back to where we were in no time. We’ll get to fall in love all over again.

Finally he drops her legs and walks over to the iPad. He clicks “BEGIN REBOOT” and turns back-- she quickly closes her eyes again. Jack touches her leg lovingly.

JACK (CONT'D)
Here we go.	See you at home.

The machine BEEPS and Alice’s entire body SEIZES. She’s being reset. Jack walks back over to his CHAIR. He connects his own IMPLANT DEVICE to the machine, lays down, closes his eyes, and--


EXT. ALICE AND JACK’S HOUSE - DAY

The sun BEAMS as Jack opens the passenger side door of his convertible, helping Alice out of the car. Bunny watches from next door as she trims her roses, gasping delightedly when she sees it’s Alice. Jack calls over to Bunny--

JACK
Look who’s feeling better!

Alice swats him lovingly.

ALICE
Don’t shout it to the whole

neighborhood.

JACK
Oh, I put it in the paper. And there’s a radio announcement later--

She goes to swat him again but he catches her hand flirtatiously. She’s bright, happy-- not fake, necessarily, but like herself in the beginning.

BUNNY
HALLELUJAH!

Jack and Alice walk over to Bunny. She leans over the hedge to hug Alice, grabbing her tight--
 
80.


BUNNY (CONT'D)
I missed you so much I started

writing my gossip in a journal.

Alice laughs.	Bunny takes her in:

BUNNY (CONT'D)
How are you?

ALICE
I’m good.
(then, almost prepared)

I’m having a hard time remembering things, but I know that I must have behaved--

BUNNY
Stop.	I’m just glad you’re back.

She squeezes Alice’s hand.	Alice squeezes back gratefully.

JACK
I told the guys I’d meet them on
the course.	Why don’t you two

catch up while I play 18?

BUNNY
Yes, please.	Play 36.	Play 72!
Alice can help me garden.

Alice makes a face.	Bunny clarifies:

BUNNY (CONT'D)
Sit and drink and look at my

plants.

ALICE
Oh, yes please.


EXT. BUNNY AND DEAN’S BACKYARD - DAY

Alice and Bunny sit in Bunny’s backyard, drinking and laughing as Bunny fills her in on the town gossip,.

BUNNY
Peg’s face got so red I thought it might actually pop off.

ALICE
Peg is...
 
81.


BUNNY
Peter’s wife.	Always pregnant.
Inexplicably annoying.

ALICE
Yes, of course.

BUNNY
It’ll come back to you.

Bunny’s trying for cheer, but there’s something sad behind it. They’re interrupted by childish SQUEALS-- Bunny’s kids Hank and Fred sprint into the backyard, wobbling beneath the weight of their bags.

BUNNY’S SON HANK
(delighted)

MISS ALICE!

They jump into Alice’s lap. Alice looks at Bunny, happily surprised by the reaction. Bunny laughs, suddenly so flooded with relief to have her friend back she almost cries.

CUT TO:

ECU of a NEEDLE landing in the groove of a record.


INT. VARIOUS - ALICE AND JACK'S HOUSE - DAY

Alice is back in her element, tackling her housework like a machine. She SCRUBS-- DUSTS-- SNAPS laundry straight--

She starts absent-mindedly WHISTLING the song she had in her head-- the one Jack whistles in the real world.

She stops dead in her tracks. We PUSH IN on her as she goes completely still.


INT. FOYER - ALICE AND JACK'S HOUSE - DAY

Jack walks in, sweaty and happy, golf bag over his shoulder.

Alice is waiting for him, holding a COCKTAIL in a HIGHBALL GLASS, a perfect pout on her lips. An incredible LUNCH sits on the table behind her.

ALICE
I figured you’d have worked up an

appetite.

Jack drops his bag, thrilled to be home.
 
82.


INT. DINING ROOM - ALICE AND JACK’S HOUSE - DAY

Jack rubs Alice’s feet in his lap as they eat.

JACK
Violet asked if we wanted to play
tennis next week.
(then, re: the food)
This is amazing.	Are there more

potatoes?

ALICE
Yes, I’ll get you some--

She starts to stand, but Jack stops her.

JACK
Don’t get up, I can get it.	You
made this whole spread.	Let me
take care of my wife.

Jack grins.	But he doesn’t move.	He looks down, concerned.

ALICE
What’s wrong?

JACK
I don’t--

He goes to move again, but nothing happens.

JACK (CONT'D)
My legs.

ALICE
Baby?

JACK
I can’t move my legs.

ALICE
Just your legs?

His eyes go wide and he looks up, scared.

JACK
Or my arms.

ALICE
Good.	It should be limbs first.
Then general motor functions.

JACK
...what?
 
83.


She places her old bottle of pills, now EMPTY, on the table.

ALICE
Don’t worry, darling. It’s just the sedative you’ve been trying to force down my throat. 500 milligrams should knock you out without stopping your heart.
(then)
Hopefully.	My math could be wrong.

JACK
How do you know that?

ALICE
Because I’m a fucking doctor.

Jack blinks.	Then PASSES OUT.

CUT TO BLACK.


INT. DINING ROOM - ALICE AND JACK’S HOUSE - NIGHT

SLAP. Jack’s startled awake by Alice’s hand smacking him across the face. He tries to get his bearings-- his arms and legs are tied to the chair. Alice is eating the cake she prepared for desert straight from the pan.

ALICE
What’s wrong, sweetie?	Did you
have a nightmare?

JACK
Alice.	What are you doing...

Alice picks up the pill bottle, admiring it.

ALICE
I have to admit, I wasn’t sure this would work. But the mistake you idiots made was in making everything here real. Food gets you full. Alcohol gets you drunk. Pills knock you out.

JACK
Honey, you’re scaring me.

ALICE
I know who you are. I know what you did to me. Whatever you tried to do, whatever you did to Margaret, it didn’t work.
 
84.


JACK
You’re having an episode--

ALICE
I was supposed to forget, but it
made me remember.	It wasn’t just
Frank, it was you.	You hooked me

up to that machine--

JACK
This is okay.	We’ll go back to Dr.
Collins--

ALICE
How do I get out?

JACK
Get out of where?

ALICE
This fucking place. How do I make the exit come back?

JACK
Listen to yourself, baby. We need to take you to the doctor.


EXT. ALICE AND JACK’S HOUSE - DAY

A COUPLE walks by, on a neighborhood stroll. Through the house’s PICTURE WINDOW, they see Alice and Jack sitting having lunch. Jack’s back is to them, seemingly fine. Alice spots them and waves cheerfully.

HOUSEWIFE ON A WALK
I’m so happy they’re doing better.


INT. DINING ROOM - ALICE AND JACK'S HOUSE - DAY

Alice’s fake cheer drops as she turns back to Jack.

ALICE
Tell me where the exit is.

JACK
You’re my wife.	I can help you--

Alice laughs.

ALICE
Help me?!	You’re sick.	You’re a
monster--
 
85.


JACK
I love you--

ALICE
I saw you in that disgusting room.

I saw what you really look like.

JACK
Stop--

ALICE
You’re pathetic.

JACK
Stop it--

ALICE
You kidnapped me. I have a life out there. I help people. I’m not your fucking property. You keep me locked in a cage--

Something snaps in Jack, his face distorted with rage--

JACK
I SAVED YOU.

He can’t control himself, he’s so offended--

JACK (CONT'D)
I brought you here to give you a good life. All I wanted to do was make you happy. You were miserable and tired and lonely and I saved you from that loneliness. I’m the only one who loves you enough to take care of you. I spent everything I have on you.

ALICE
How long have I been here?

Jack’s rage deflates.	He looks like he wants to cry.

JACK
What does it matter? You worked so hard, for what? You were never happy before, but you are here. You’re happy with me.

ALICE
You’re psychotic.
 
86.


JACK
That’s not you talking.	That’s
society.	That’s your friends and
your peers and these bullshit
modern mind games you’re taught.

You like it here!

ALICE
It’s not real.

JACK
What’s more real than this?

ALICE
Anything!	Everything here is fake!
Nothing’s alive.

She grabs a knife.	Jack is suddenly scared.

JACK
Whoa--

She holds it against her neck--

ALICE
Margaret just came back like
nothing happened.	I could kill

myself and just wake up--

JACK
(frantic)

NO! No no no. Everyone only gets one reset. You and Margaret-- you’ve been reset already. If you die in the simulation, you won’t wake up. Please don’t hurt yourself.

She holds the knife out to him.

ALICE
Fine.	I’ll kill you.

JACK
You can’t. If a man dies in the simulation, he’ll die in the real world. I’d starve, there’s no one to take care of him. I would really die. Please baby.

Alice hesitates.	Despite everything, he has a pull on her.
 
87.


JACK (CONT'D)
We love each other. This isn’t fake. What we feel isn’t fake. I would rather be here with you than anywhere else.

She watches him for a beat.

ALICE
Are they all like me?

JACK
What?

ALICE
The other wives.	Are they all
trapped here?	Is Bunny?

JACK
Don’t worry about them. Just think about us. About you--

ALICE
Is Bunny hooked up to a machine

somewhere in some room?

JACK
I don’t know where Bunny is. I don’t even know who Dean is. It’s not our business. A man is responsible for his own wife and nothing else.

ALICE
But she’s hooked up to a machine--

JACK
The women here have all been saved! The world out there is fucked. It’s full of hatred and violence and bigotry and cruelty. Frank created a better world. I have to leave every day just to make enough money to keep us here and I hate every minute of it. You get to stay here. We can stay here. Together. You like this. And that’s okay. It’s okay to be happy here. With me. Just think about our life. Think about what you really want.

Alice drains the rest of her drink. She looks torn. Like she’s maybe acquiescing.
 
88.


JACK (CONT'D)
I love you.

ALICE
I don’t care.

And Alice levels him with the HIGHBALL GLASS she’s holding, shattering it against his temple. Blood splatters as his chair topples over.


EXT. ALICE AND JACK’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Through the picture window, we see Alice standing over Jack’s discarded chair, although from the outside we can’t see what she’s staring at.

Then she walks out of frame and comes back holding one of Jack’s GOLF CLUBS. She swings it up and WHACKS Jack over and over, blood splattering all over her dress.

She walks out of frame again, then comes back with a BROOM.
She starts to clean up the mess.


EXT. STREET - DAY

Alice, still covered in blood, marches down her street, holding Jack’s golf club. She passes a car and swings the club, SMASHING the back window. She winds up and SHATTERS a mailbox, then a front gate, everything’s she’s passing.

ALICE
We have to go right now!

The commotion brings a HOUSEWIFE to her window. A SECOND HOUSEWIFE walks out of her front door, her ANXIOUS HUSBAND trying to keep her inside, but she ignores him. It’s like they’re being drawn toward Alice.

ALICE (CONT'D)
We’re all prisoners here!

Bunny comes to the window of her house, watching. She’s scared for her friend, but she can’t move.

ALICE (CONT'D)
We don’t have to live like this!

Alice slows there’s a row of cars waiting to stop her, like a barricade. Dr. Collins steps out of one of the cars.

VIOLET (O.S.)
Alice.
 
89.


Violet is standing in her own doorway, alarmed. She looks toward the line of cars, then beckons Alice toward her, opening her door. Alice hurries toward her.


INT. VIOLET AND BILL’S HOUSE - DAY

Violet hurries Alice inside, slamming the door behind her.
Alice exhales, relieved, as Violet takes in her appearance.
 

VIOLET
Whose blood is that?
 


ALICE
Where’s Bill?

 
VIOLET (CONT'D)
I don’t know--

ALICE
We have to get the others.	If we--

She stops when she realizes Violet is staring at the floor.
She looks terrified.

VIOLET
I’m sorry. I just want you to get better.

Alice turns, confused--

Frank is sitting in Violet’s living room. He grins. Before Alice can scream--

CUT TO BLACK.

DR. COLLINS (O.S.)
Alice?

It’s SENSORY OVERLOAD again. In ALICE’S POV, lights and sounds slowly come into focus. She raises her arms-- they’re tied down again. But this time she’s in...


INT. PATIENT ROOM - HOSPITAL - DAY

She’s strapped to a chair. A blurry Dr. Collins enters the room, sitting down next to her.

DR. COLLINS
It’s okay.	You’re okay.

Alice SCREAMS, pulling against her straps. NURSE COLLINS walks in to hold her down. Dr. Collins stays very calm.
 
90.


DR. COLLINS (CONT'D)
Alice?	Do you know where you are?
You’ve suffered a psychotic break.
 

ALICE
No no no no no--
 


DR. COLLINS (CONT'D) You’re in the hospital. Do you remember what happened?

 
DR. COLLINS (CONT'D)
Your hallucinations became violent.

ALICE
I know you’re a part of this--

Frank uses you--

DR. COLLINS
It’s important to establish reality when coming out of something like this. I’m incredibly sorry to tell you this. But during the... episode...you killed your husband.

ALICE
He kidnapped me.	He trapped me
here, this isn’t real--

DR. COLLINS
Bunny told us about the delusions you’ve been having. The alternate reality. I wish I’d known. I failed you in your initial diagnosis.

He’s kind, and sad, and convincing. Nurse Collins won’t look at her. Doubt starts creeping in.

ALICE
I know this isn’t real.

DR. COLLINS
I should have recognized earlier
signs.	The stress and isolation
you were feeling...	I’ve seen
psychotic breaks like this in
housewives living in big cities,
simply from the stress of home
life.	Adding the seclusion of
Oasis...

ALICE
Jack admitted it to me. He told me everything.
 
91.


DR. COLLINS
(kindly)

You’ve hallucinated quite a bit recently, haven’t you? Margaret’s fall, plane crashes, distorted faces...

He shows her a photo. It’s Jack’s bloody, broken face, the shattered highball glass next to him. He’s dead.

ALICE
No... that’s not...

DR. COLLINS
I’m truly sorry, Alice. I’ve given a statement to the police confirming your damaged mental state and recommending you stay here instead of any prison time.

Alice takes the photo in her hand and sinks into her chair as she realizes what she’s done.

Then there’s a KNOCK at the door.	It’s Frank.

Alice freezes. But he just walks in and kneels, kindly, next to her chair.

FRANK
It’s going to be okay, Alice.
We’re taking care of you now.

You’ll be safe with us.

He touches her knee paternally.

FRANK (CONT'D)
Shelley and I are sending all our

thoughts and prayers.


INT. ROOM - HOSPITAL - DAY

Alice sits in her room. Time has passed. She’s a muted version of herself, drained of color and life.

There’s a stir in the hallway. At first, Alice doesn’t bother to turn around. But then she recognizes the voice...

BUNNY (O.S.)
I do have permission.

It’s Bunny.	She’s a little more refined, fancier,
imposing...she looks more like Shelley. She’s arguing with a NURSE at reception.
 
92.


HOSPITAL NURSE
I’d need to ask Dr. Collins...

BUNNY
I wouldn’t have come all the way
down here it if wasn’t already
approved.
(then)

I could call Shelley right now and she can ask Frank directly. Is that what you’d like?

HOSPITAL NURSE
(a little scared)

No.	No.

BUNNY
Then I’ll see my friend now.


INT. ROOM - HOSPITAL - DAY

Bunny sits with Alice, trying to stay upbeat despite their surroundings. She absent-mindedly arranges Alice’s things to look a little nicer.

BUNNY
This room isn’t bad.
(then)

I’m sorry I haven’t been.

ALICE
I understand.

BUNNY
You should have told me it was such a party.

Alice manages a small smile.	Bunny takes her hand.

BUNNY (CONT'D)
Shall we go get some lunch?

ALICE
I can’t.

BUNNY
You can, actually. I got you a day pass. Let’s go into down. We’ll get some fresh air, catch up on gossip...it’ll be good for you.

She tucks a strand of Alice’s hair behind her ear.
 
93.


BUNNY (CONT'D)
Do they not have hair brushes here?

Are they banned?

Alice laughs despite herself.


INT. DEAN’S CAR/EXT. ROAD - DAY

Bunny drives.	Alice stares out the window.

BUNNY
We’re basically Frank’s neighbors, which is sometimes more stressful than fun. But Dean takes the bus in to work so I can have the car during the day now, which is nice. A little more freedom. I can pick up all my boyfriends.

Alice leans her face against the window, closing her eyes.


INT. DEAN’S CAR/EXT. ROAD - DAY

Alice wakes as the car pulls to a stop. She looks around, confused-- they’re in the middle of the desert, parked just before what looks like the edge of a cliff.

BUNNY
We’re here.

ALICE
Where?

Bunny’s still staring straight ahead.

BUNNY
I just wanted to take you on a nice walk. Get some air. But I couldn’t stop you. I tried to get help but it was too late. You jumped.

ALICE
What are you talking about?

BUNNY
This is the end.

ALICE
The end of what?

Bunny finally turns to look at her.
 
94.


BUNNY
I’m sorry, Alice.	You were right.
I know that now.

Alice is gobsmacked.

BUNNY (CONT'D)
I wanted to ignore it, I wanted you to ignore it, I made you think you were crazy because I didn’t want you to leave...

ALICE
Bunny...

BUNNY
You did something. After you left. And I couldn’t ignore it anymore. This is the edge of what Frank built. It’s an exit.
(then)
They don’t bother protecting it
because they don’t believe anyone
will be brave enough to jump.

Alice looks out, astounded. Bunny did it. She found a way out. She turns to Bunny, electrified--

ALICE
Come with me.	We’ll go together.

Bunny clutches the wheel, trying to keep it together.

BUNNY
I can’t.

ALICE
You have to. I know it’s scary but it’s worth it. We can be free--

BUNNY
This is my life.	My kids.

ALICE
Bunny, this isn’t real. This isn’t all your life can be--

BUNNY
I’ll tell them I tried to stop you.

She says it simply, with no room for negotiation.
 
95.


Alice knows what Bunny’s doing for her. She looks at the edge, then turns back to her friend.

ALICE
I love you.

They hug.	Bunny can’t look while Alice gets out of the car.


EXT. CLIFF - DAY

As soon as Alice is out of the car, Bunny slowly pulls away.

Alice waits a beat, until Bunny is out of sight. Then she turns to the cliff.

She stares down. It’s a terrifying drop. She takes a breath, smiles, raises her arms, and then LEAPS off of it.

As Alice falls through the air--

CUT TO BLACK.





EXT. CALIFORNIA DESERT - DAY

Again, we SOAR over the seemingly endless California desert.

FRANK (V.O.)
Are you ready to live the life

you’ve imagined?

Suddenly...the Oasis development. It’s nearly tripled in size. Massive construction spills new roads and houses out into the desert. This place is growing, fast.

FRANK (V.O.)
Welcome to Oasis.	The fastest
growing community in the world.	As
an employee and dedicated member of
the Oasis Project, you’re invited

to live here, in our paradise
