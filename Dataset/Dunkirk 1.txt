BLAM BLAM BLAM! Tommy jolts, grabs his trousers. All six race away from us, towards a fence twenty yards away. One by one, five are shot down. The survivor climbs the fence. Gunfire bursts through the fence, ten feet away -

Tommy tries to reload his rifle - fingers struggling with the magazine, training forgotten. Gunfire splinters the fence, five feet away -

Tommy thrusts his index finger into the breech of his rifle again and again, scraping skin. A round jumps into the chamber -

Gunfire three feet away -

Tommy tries once, twice - slides the bolt forward -

Gunfire right next to him -

Tommy spins around, fires blind until empty, scrambles out the back. He races down narrow Dunkirk streets. Breathing. Kit jangling... Building after building... He rounds a corner -

BLAM! Bullets hit dirt and bricks near him. The street ahead is barricaded, manned by French troops.

TOMMY
ANGLAIS! AINGLAIS!

The French stop firing and wave him through.

He scrambles over their sandbag barricade, taking in their dirty frightened faces as he passes...

A French Soldier grabs him...

FRENCH SOLDIER
Allez, Anglais.

Tommy’s mouth opens at the man’s bitterness.

FRENCH SOLDIER (CONT’D)

Bon voyage.

He shoves Tommy down the street behind their protection.

Gunfire behind. Tommy takes off again, hurtling down the dark street, heading towards the blazing light of -


EXT. BEACH AT MALO LES BAINS - CONTINUOUS

The longest, widest beach he’s ever seen, sunlight dazzling off the water, endless dark fences snaking across the sand and out into the water. Tommy squints - not fences, lines of men, hundreds of thousands of men...

Tommy looks around, clutching his stomach. He clambers over a dune, feverishly undoing his belt, dropping trousers and squatting before he realizes -

He’s not alone -

Another soldier, British army shirt undone, sweating with the labour of burying a body. This is Gibson.

The other man notices Tommy, but barely pauses. Tommy finishes, pulls ups his trousers and moves towards him. Tommy helps stoop to tie over the body.

Tommy notices the corpe’s stockinged feet, then watches Gibson stoop to tie his boots...

Gibson looks up at him. Tommy shrugs, gestures for Gibson’s water can. Gibson hands it over and Tommy takes a swig, carefully catching drops in his hand, then licking them off his palm.

Tommy leaves Gibson buttoning his shirt and heads back onto the beach.

There are destroyers out on the water, too far to reach.

Tommy wanders down to join one of the long, snaking lines which extends into the sea, soldiers up to their chests in water, waiting patiently for ships which do not move.

The man at the back turns to Tommy, unwelcoming. Points at his own insignia.

MAN
Grenadiers, mate.

Tommy moves off. Looks around at other impossibly long lines, at the unattainable ships. Futile.

A line of stretcher-bearers comes past, carrying wounded men along the beach towards the harbour...

Looking where they’re headed, Tommy sees a long, narrow breakwater extending out into the sea, packed with soldiers. A hospital ship at the end of it.

This breakwater extends a kilometer into the sea. It is called the Mole.

Super title:

Tommy becomes aware of the sound of distant aircraft.

Soldiers peer up into the sky...

MALE VOICE (O.S.)
DIVE BOMBERS!

Tommy spots the distinctive kinked wings of the notorious Stuka dive bomber, its nightmarish howl rising as it picks up speed, diving at the beach...

The lines of men instantly vanish - soldiers scattering back to the dunes, burrowing into the sand... The first bombs lift sand into the air.

The stretcher-bearers put down their loads, lying across them, protecting them as the area is hammered...

The first Stuka pulls out of its dive, revealing two more Stukas diving. There are nine more about to follow...

Tommy sees a soldier lying on his back, rifle aimed at the sky, firing defiantly, desperately at the attacking plane...

The ground around him lifts into the air with the second wave of bombs.

Tommy buries his face in the sand as the bombs blast and blast and blast -

The explosions stop. Tommy lifts his head. BOOM! Another wave of bombs explodes in series up the beach. Then, finally, quiet. Tommy rises...

The stretcher-bearers, back on their feet, lift their burdens (four bearers per stretcher, one at each corner).

Several stretchers are left behind on the sand.

Soldiers on the beach watch in despair as one of the destroyers is slipping below the water, smoke billowing.

The youth, George (seventeen), leaps from the dock into the well. Two naval officers emerge from the cabin, pushing past. George watches them go, confused...

Mr. Dawson (fifties, civilian dress) hands George a stack of china plates and ducks back inside.

A second young man, Peter (nineteen), emerges, carrying boxes.

PETER
Navy’s requisitioned her - there’s some men across the Channel, at Dunkirk, need taking off.

They told us to strip her and load those life jackets.

George looks along at the dock. At a pile of hundreds of life jackets. George looks at Peter. Surprised.

GEORGE

A Warrant Officer tries to keep order as men line up to start the shuffle out along the eight-foot wide concrete mole.

The line of stretcher-bearers approaches...

From the base all you can see is the backs of helmeted heads queuing out onto the narrow breakwater.

The Warrant Officer sees the stretchers, waves them past -

WARRANT OFFICER
Along the mole. All the way, she’s leaving -

A ship’s whistle -

WARRANT OFFICER (CONT’D)
That’s it.

Tommy and Gibson hear the ship’s whistle. They start running with the stretcher, heading for the base of the mole...

The Warrant Officer addresses a group of French soldiers.

WARRANT OFFICER

Tommy and Gibson arrive, panting. The Warrant Officer looks up at them. The ship’s whistle - the Warrant Officer points up -

WARRANT OFFICER (CONT’D) That’s two minutes - you’ve missed it.

He turns back to arguing with the French...

Tommy pushes forward with the stretcher. Soldiers try to let him through on the narrow mole -

The Warrant Officer, seeing Tommy, just shakes his head.

Stretchers are loaded up the gangplank onto the deck of the ship, supervised by a Petty Officer.

He checks his watch, then looks along the mole at the remaining stretchers...

Tommy weaves along the mole, squeezing past the mass of troops jamming the breakwater...

Tommy leans out over the edge where the rail is missing, a twenty-foot drop to the churning water...

Gibson follows, echoing Tommy’s route and footing.


EXT. HOSPITAL SHIP - CONTINUOUS

The last of the line of stretchers is carefully, awkwardly raised up from the mole onto the deck of the ship. The Petty Officer speaks urgently to the last stretcher-bearer.

PETTY OFFICER

The Stretcher-Bearer nods, too breathless to speak, then follows his colleagues back down off the ship.

An explosion hits the water nearby -

Everyone hits the deck as shells impacts the water.

The Petty Officer glares down at him.

Tommy breaks through a tight crowd of soldiers and stops.

In front of him is a jagged chasm. One narrow plank laid across it. The drop is fifteen feet to rocks and concrete below.

The ship’s whistle sounds. Tommy stares -

SOLDIER
Take a run at it!

Tommy glances at the Soldier who spoke. Looks back at Gibson.

TOMMY
One, two, three!

Tommy bolts across, pure concentration, the plank bowing and bouncing as he crosses the middle, Gibson following. Tommy’s foot slips, he almost goes over, rights himself -

Helpful arms grab them as they hit the other side, a couple of cheers from the crowd. Tommy ploughs on -

Mr. Dawson comes to the back of the well, fits the tiller, to steer from outside, Peter at his side. George, on the bow, looks across at several naval vessels on the same course.

Suddenly he spots a bomber overhead -

GEORGE
Mr. Dawson!

Mr. Dawson’s eyes don’t leave his course -

MR. DAWSON
One of ours, George.

George looks up at the plane. A Blenheim passes over.

Looking down to his left - a fishing trawler bobbing along.
Further back down the convoy he sees a Thames paddle steamer.

A destroyer approaches from the opposite direction. As George peers, he starts to make out shapes of men on the decks.

The destroyer passes close enough that George can see the boat is packed with soldiers. Weary, bedraggled, dispirited soldiers. George stares at the haunted faces.

As the Moonstone rides over the wake of the destroyer, an ominous boom reverberates in the distance. Too sudden for thunder, the boom multiplies into a distant barrage...

Mr. Dawson comes forward, drawn by the sound. He stares at the horizon - distant black smoke precisely where they’re headed. More booms. Mr. Dawson looks at George. Who is scared. He puts his hand on his shoulder. Nods reassuringly.

They’re scrambling.

Commander Bolton turns to Colonel Winnant, the army representative.

COMMANDER BOLTON
Colonel, you’re going to have to
decide how many more wounded to

tanks I’ve stopped.

COMMANDER BOLTON
Why?

COLONEL WINNANT
Waste precious tanks, when you can pick us off from the air, like fish in a barrel?

COMMANDER BOLTON
How long does London expect the
army to hold out before we make

terms?

The Rear Admiral looks sharply at the idea.

REAR ADMIRAL
Make terms? They’re not stopping here. We need to get our army back.

The Rear Admiral points across the dark water...

Bolton straightens up.

COMMANDER BOLTON
Right, this mole stays open at all

costs.

Bolton points at the funnel and masts of sunken ships.

COMMANDER BOLTON (CONT’D) We’re in range of artillery from the west - anything else sinks out here, the mole’s blocked and we’re stuffed.

REAR ADMIRAL
Can’t we load from the beaches?

COLONEL WINNANT
Better than standing out here when

COMMANDER BOLTON
Impossible.

The Rear Admiral looks at the lines of men on the beaches.

Much nearer: a shape. A wreck. Upside down.

Mr. Dawson moves quickly down the yacht to the well and takes the helm, throttling back. He gestures for Peter to head to the bow.

The Moonstone approaches the wreck. Bodies surround the overturned hull.

Crouched on the hull - a soldier.

Mr. Dawson reverses the screw, slowing to a crawl. Peter stares out at the Shivering Soldier.

PETER
Can you swim?

The Shivering Soldier stares back at Peter. Peter looks back at Mr. Dawson.

PETER (CONT’D)

Mr. Dawson looks down the side of the boat, considers.

MR. DAWSON
Can’t risk it!

Mr. Dawson turns to George.

MR. DAWSON (CONT’D)
Take Peter a line.

George grabs a coiled rope and heads up to the bow. Peter takes the rope from George -

PETER
I’ll throw you a line!

The Shivering Soldier looks up at him, blank. Peter tosses the line. It hits the water several feet in front of the soldier who stares at it.

Peter gathers the line, then tosses it again.

The Shivering Soldier springs for it, grabbing it and hanging on as Peter and George reel him in, pulling him around to the stern ladder.

He is too exhausted to make it up the ladder, so they grab his shirt, pulling him into the well.

George grabs a blanket and puts it around the Soldier’s shoulders.

Mr. Dawson glances at the Soldier, then reverses from the wreck the way they came in, and steers wide around the visible portion of the wreck.

Once the water ahead is open, Mr. Dawson speeds up, heading again for the dark smoke of Dunkirk.

Restless, the soldiers look behind and in front. There’s simply nowhere to go. The awful whine builds. Then changes pitch as the bombers go into their dive.

BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM! The bombs impact the sea either side of the mole. Soldiers crouch as low as they can -

The onslaught is endless, terrible and inescapable.

BOOM! A direct hit to the hospital ship -

The Stukas have gone.

Screams and shouts - people start jumping over the side of the hospital ship onto the mole...

The men cast her off and push her off. Crew members and orderlies leap from the deck into the water -

The bow is blazing, sinking ship drifts away from the mole.

Tommy and Gibson pull soldiers up onto the beams of the mole.

As the bow comes around, the stern scrapes along the wooden pilings, splintering them in its path -

A flailing soldier is in its path, trying to swim free -

The steel hull is about to crush him -

Tommy grabs him by the shoulders and yanks with all his might, pulling him clear just as the hull grinds against the wood. Tommy looks down on the breathless, wet soldier. The wet soldier focuses on Tommy.

This is Alex. He nods thanks. Tommy nods back.

Tommy, watched by Alex, slips into the water, then pulls himself out, dripping. Gibson follows suit. Alex laugh at them... then helps them push into the group.

They follow the wet soldiers up onto the mole, where Bolton’s men shepherd them onto a launch.

Tommy and Gibson make themselves inconspicuous among the Highlanders, eyes down.

As the launch pulls away from the mole, Tommy glances back at the men lining the breakwater.

The launch motors out of the harbour.

It approaches a destroyer, its sheer iron side towering above the launch, as it bobs up and down alongside.

Cargo nets are dropped over the side, and the men start to step up onto the rail of the bobbing ship, waiting for the rhythmic movement towards the iron wall, grabbing at the rope mesh, struggling to pull themselves up.

Tommy steps up to the railing, next to an exhausted soldier who can barely lift himself up. Tommy grabs his shoulder to steady on the rail as the launch bounces off the iron wall of the destroyer.

They both grab at the net, Tommy climbing up -

The exhausted soldier has not got his feet into the netting, he slips over...

The gap between the launch and the destroyer shrinks to nothing -

The soldier’s legs are crushed between the two oblivious crafts. He screams - hands pull him up as the craft separate...

The men collapse onto the deck in exhausted piles. Sailors and Nurses urge them to move below decks.

SAILOR
Down below. Come on, mate -

Tommy follows Alex and his mates to a doorway at the head of the stairs down below. A Nurse is standing there.

NURSE
Come on, boys. There’s a nice cup
of tea for you down there. This

way, come on.


INT. DESTROYER - CONTINUOUS

Tommy starts down the stairs. Gibson has stopped at the top, looking down into the stairwell.

NURSE
Come on, down you go -

Gibson, shaking his head, steps back.

Alex sees this - turns to follow Tommy into the crowd in the hold. They are handed a cup of tea and a hunk of bread.

EXT. DESTROYER - CONTINUOUS

Out on deck, Gibson sits by the companionway in the gathering dark as the ship gets under way...


INT. HOLD, DESTROYER - CONTINUOUS

Down below, Tommy and Alex eat and drink hungrily and gratefully. Between bites, Alex gestures to the stairs.
 
27.


ALEX
What’s wrong with your friend?

Tommy watches the door to the hold close. Takes another bite.
Uneasy.

Looks around the hold, packed like the tube at rush hour.

TOMMY
Looking for a quick way out. In

case we go down.

Tommy and Alex edge through the crowd towards the stairs...

CUT TO:


EXT. MOONSTONE, ENGLISH CHANNEL - DAY

George hands the Shivering Soldier a steaming mug of tea.

The BOOMS start reverberating again.

The Shivering Soldier glances up. Realizes something...

SHIVERING SOLDIER
Where are we going?

MR. DAWSON
Dunkirk.

SHIVERING SOLDIER
No, we’re going to England!

MR. DAWSON
We have to go to Dunkirk first.

SHIVERING SOLDIER
I’M NOT GOING BACK!

Peter watches from the companionway. The Shivering Soldier throws his arm out of the dark cloud on the horizon -

SHIVERING SOLDIER (CONT’D)
Look at it! We go there we’ll die!

Mr. Dawson looks at the Shivering Soldier. Calm.

MR. DAWSON
I see your point, son. Take your tea below and warm up while we plot a course.
 
28.


The Shivering Soldier considers this. Then takes his blanket and heads down the companionway. Peter helps him down below.

INT. CABIN, MOONSTONE - CONTINUOUS

Peter opens the door to the forepeak and sits the Shivering Soldier down on a narrow bunk.

PETER
I’ll get you some more tea.

Peter shuts the door. Looks at the bolt. Considering.


EXT. MOONSTONE - CONTINUOUS

George looks up at the Commander. Addresses him with the tone of a child trying to speak like a grown-up...

GEORGE
Is he a coward?

Mr. Dawson looks sharply at George.

MR. DAWSON
He’s shell-shocked, George. He’s
not himself. He may never be

himself again.


INT. CABIN, MOONSTONE - MOMENTS LATER

Peter hands the Shivering Soldier a cup of tea. The Shivering Soldier accepts it wordlessly. Staring in front of him. Peter closes the forepeak door. Pauses.

Peter gently slides the bolt.

INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 1 - DAY

Farrier looks down at the mass of ships and boats passing each other. There is the minesweeper, Castor, every inch of her deck covered with troops -

COLLINS
(over radio)

Heinkel, eleven o’clock, lining up to drop her load on that minesweeper -
 
29.


Farrier’s head snaps around - spots the German bomber -

FARRIER
Fighters?


INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 2 - CONTINUOUS

Collins peers down, scanning around the Heinkel bomber for its fighter escort... Spots -

COLLINS
109s - off her starboard -

FARRIER
(over radio)

I’m on the bomber.

Collins pushes forward into a dive...


EXT. SKY OVER ENGLISH CHANNEL - CONTINUOUS

Spitfire 2 dives at the German fighters, cannons blasting...

Spitfire 1 dives at the German bomber, cannons blasting...


INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 1 - CONTINUOUS

Farrier has the Heinkel in his sights, bucking and weaving as his Spitfire slices down through turbulent air... He pushes the button on the stick which controls his guns...

He rolls away from the Heinkel as he dives beneath it, taking his finger off the trigger, fighting the g’s with his neck as he pulls out of the dive...


INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 2 - CONTINUOUS

Collins fires at one of the 109s until he sees smoke trailing. He dives between the German planes...

INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 1 - CONTINUOUS

Farrier scans his surroundings as he tries to orient himself relative to the Heinkel...

Finding it, he pulls the stick, lining up for another run at it, this time from below...

The bomber is in his sights - he fires his guns...
 
30.


He flashes past, dangerously close to its top turret which hurls tracer bullets at him. He sees sparking on the hull of the bomber -


INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 2 - CONTINUOUS

Coming around, starting to climb, Collins sees the Heinkel veer off course, heading from the minesweeper -

COLLINS
She’s turning - you must’ve damaged her.

FARRIER
(over radio)

Where’s the escort?

COLLINS
I got one of -

BLAM BLAM BLAM!! Cannon fire rips into Spitfire 2. Collins yanks the stick but it’s too late. Flames leap from the fuselage...

COLLINS (CONT’D)
I’m going down.

FARRIER
(over radio)

I’m on him - bail out.

Collins checks his parachute, opens the canopy. The wind howls inside the cockpit. He survey’s the water below - slides his canopy shut again.

COLLINS
The swell looks good, I’m ditching.

CUT TO:


INT. HOLD, DESTROYER - NIGHT

The munching and slurping of starving soldiers.

The engines kick into gear as the destroyer starts to move -

A cheer goes up around the hundreds of men in the hold...
 
31.


EXT. DESTROYER - CONTINUOUS

Up on deck, Gibson watches several row boats heading towards them. Hearing the engines, they start shouting -

MALE VOICES
Wait! Wait for us!

Gibson spots white water on the black sea - a wake -

MALE VOICE (O.S.)
TORPEDO!

An explosion lifts	water at the side of the ship -


INT. HOLD, DESTROYER - CONTINUOUS

The cheering stops, Boooooms shudder the suddenly fragile iron walls of the hold, massive percussions of wobbling metal sheets.


EXT. DESTROYER - CONTINUOUS

A blast that moves every bolt of the destroyer -


INT. HOLD, DESTROYER - CONTINUOUS

Anyone standing is thrown off their feet -


EXT. DESTROYER - CONTINUOUS

A vast plume of fire explodes up and out of the funnel. The deck blasts apart -


INT. HOLD, DESTROYER - CONTINUOUS

Men scream as the iron plates of the walls buckle. A glimpse of water blasting in -

The lights go out. Complete darkness...

Sound of men screaming barely audible over the sound of blasting water and bending metal -
 
32.


EXT. DESTROYER - CONTINUOUS

The ship lists, rapidly sinking. The row boats pull away, hard. Gibson prepares to jump - glances back at the closed door to the hold - jumps back, opens the door -


INT. HOLD, DESTROYER - CONTINUOUS

Blackness.

The dim light of the open door becomes a beacon. Tommy spots Gibson waiving -

Tommy and Alex claw their way up the steps as the entire ship goes under -


EXT. DESTROYER - CONTINUOUS

Tommy and Alex burst free of the door as it sinks beneath the waves and -

They pull away from the disappearing ship with the strength born of absolute desperation...

CUT TO:


EXT. MOONSTONE, ENGLISH CHANNEL - DAY

George hears planes behind them. He looks up -

Three Spitfires in confident formation sweep overhead...

Mr. Dawson keeps his eyes on the black smoke ahead of them.

MR. DAWSON
Spitfires, George. Greatest plane

ever built.

George smiles. Then looks quizzical -

GEORGE
You didn’t even look.

MR. DAWSON
Rolls Royce Merlin engines.
Sweetest sound you could hear out here.
