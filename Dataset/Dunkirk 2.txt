INT. CABIN, MOONSTONE - CONTINUOUS

Peter is folding a chart. A clicking sound catches attention - the handle of the forepeak door is being rattled from the other side. Peter freezes, uncertain what to do...

BANG - the rattles become bangs -

SHIVERING SOLDIER (O.S.)
Hello?! Anyone there?!

Peter puts the chart down, takes a step towards the door -

BANG!

SHIVERING SOLDIER (O.S.) (CONT’D)
OPEN UP, DAMMIT!

Peter freezes. Turns back to the companionway -


EXT. MOONSTONE - CONTINUOUS

Peter pokes his head out. Mr. Dawson looks at him, quizzical-

PETER
He wants to come out -

The banging and shouting of the Shivering Soldier continues.

MR. DAWSON
What did you do? Lock him in?

Peter is at a loss.

MR. DAWSON (CONT’D)
Let him out, for God’s sake!


INT. CABIN, MOONSTONE - CONTINUOUS

Peter comes down the companionway, reluctantly approaching the banging, rattling door...

The banging stops...

Peter reaches up to the bolt, braces, gently slides it back...

Opens the door. The forepeak is empty... Peter rushes in, spots the open forward hatch...
 
34.


EXT. MOONSTONE - CONTINUOUS

Mr. Dawson leans down to try and see in the cabin -

SHIVERING SOLDIER (O.S.)
You haven’t turned around!

Mr. Dawson turns calmly to the Shivering Soldier.

MR. DAWSON
No. We have a job to do.

SHIVERING SOLDIER
Job? This is pleasure yacht! You’re weekend sailors, not the blood navy! A man your age -

MR. DAWSON
Men my age dictate this war. Why are we allowed to send our children to fight it?

SHIVERING SOLDIER
YOU SHOULD BE AT HOME!

MR. DAWSON
There won’t be any home if we allow thus slaughter across the Channel. There’s no hiding from this.

Good luck. Watch your fuel...

Best of luck, Collins.

Collins checks wind direction, checks wave direction on the surface of the water -

Turns, lining up along the waves as he descends...

Lower...

The water rushes by blindingly fast...


INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 1 - DAY

Farrier watches Spitfire 2 carve gracefully across the water, before coming to a stop, floating.

Farrier spots a civilian yacht heading for Collins...

He sees Collins’ hand stick out of the canopy, waving... He tips his wings at Collins, turns away, looks ahead, chasing the 109 towards Dunkirk...

EXT. WATER, JUST OUTSIDE DUNKIRK HARBOUR - NIGHT

Tommy and Alex, life jackets on, swim on the swell, bodies and burning wreckage all around, fuel burning on the surface of the water.

Tommy and Alex pull for an overloaded row boat. Tommy grabs the side, tries to climb. He’s pushed off by the men inside -

MALE VOICE
Piss off - it’s too crowded!

Alex is grabbing at the rail as well -

ALEX
You can’t leave us! Make some room -

SOLDIER (O.S.)
You men, leave off. You’ll capsize the boat - it’s gone over twice on the way out here...

Tommy looks at the Soldier. It is the Shivering Soldier, not yet shivering, in full control of his faculties.

SOLDIER (CONT’D)
You have to stay calm. There are

plenty of boats.

ALEX
Calm?! Wait till you get torpedoed, then tell us to be calm!

SOLDIER
You have life jackets?

MALE VOICE
Yeah, they do.

SOLDIER
Don’t panic, the water’s not too
rough, or too cold. We’re heading

back to the beach -

MALE VOICE
Fuck off! Let’s go to Dover!

Several voices join in.

SOLDIER
We can’t make it across the Channel on this, lads. We need to get back to the beach and wait for another ride.

(MORE)
 
37.

SOLDIER (CONT'D)
(gestures)

It’s not even half a mile. You men in the water float here, save your strength, we’ll come back for you.

The men start rowing.

Gibson is in the back. Alex spots him.

Gibson quietly drops the rear painter (a small rope attached to the stern) into the black water.

Alex takes it, hands part of it to Tommy and they quietly drag behind the boat as it rows in to the shore... The men in the rear notice, but nobody says anything...

As the dawn breaks, the small, packed boat pulls across the calm water to the vast, packed beach at Dunkirk.

CUT TO:


EXT. MOONSTONE - DAY

The Shivering Soldier steps up to Mr. Dawson -

SHIVERING SOLDIER
What is it you think you can do out there?! On this thing?!

MR. DAWSON
Not just us. The call went out - we won’t be the only ones to answer.

SHIVERING SOLDIER
YOU DON’T EVEN HAVE GUNS!

MR. DAWSON
Did you have a gun?

SHIVERING SOLDIER
Course. A rifle - 303.

MR. DAWSON
Did it help you against the dive

bombers? Or the U-boats?

The Shivering Soldier glares at Mr. Dawson.

SHIVERING SOLDIER
You’re an old fool. And you’re
going to die if you don’t turn

around.
 
38.


The booms echo. Closer now.

SHIVERING SOLDIER (CONT’D)
We’re turning around, now!

The Shivering Soldier steps towards Mr. Dawson, screaming at the top of his lungs -

SHIVERING SOLDIER (CONT’D)
TURN IT AROUND! TURN IT AROUND! -

Peter, hearing this, makes his way back from the bow. The Shivering Soldier grabs the wheel. George grabs his shoulder -

The Shivering Soldier smashes his elbow into George’s face, sending him flying backwards down the companionway -

Peter pulls the Shivering Soldier away from the wheel.

PETER
Calm it down, mate.

The Shivering Soldier looks at him, shocked. Confused.

Peter calls down the companionway -

PETER (CONT’D)
George?

Nothing?

PETER (CONT’D)
George?!

Nothing. The Shivering Soldier watches as Peter climbs down to find -


INT. CABIN, MOONSTONE - CONTINUOUS

George, sprawled out at the foot of the steps, on his back, quietly groaning, bleeding from the back of the head. Peter grabs a life jacket and outs it behind George’s head.

PETER
It’s okay. You’re okay. It’s okay.

George blinks at Peter. Frightened.

INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 1 - DAY

Farrier chases the 109, gradually closing...

Up ahead, a convoy of ships is gathered around the entrance to the harbour...

Farrier passes over a fishing trawler with a blue cabin, covered with soldiers, strangely low in the water, water washing across its decks...

He looks up ahead to the 109, just coming into range...

He spots German planes in the distance, heading towards him - he sights the 109... Fires a short burst... Nothing...

He remembers his fuel gauge... Pointlessly pushes the button next to the cracked gauge.

No response.

Farrier checks his position on his chart. Checks the last fuel reading he grease-penciled... knows he should turn around -

Farrier sights the 109, banking slightly to bring it across his sights...

Farrier fires - the 109 starts smoking, dropping -

Farrier spins around - turning away from the approaching planes. Heading for Dover... for home.

As he passes over the sinking blue trawler, he sees men jumping into the water, swimming for a destroyer nearby...

In his rear-view mirror: the enemy planes approaching...

Farrier looks at his cracked fuel gauge... Thinking...

CUT TO:


EXT. BEACH AT ZYDECOTTE (7 MILES EAST OF DUNKIRK) - DAWN

The surf has picked up since yesterday...

Tommy, Gibson, Alex lie on the beach, sleeping as the light comes up on a stormy day.

In the distance, towards the dark smoke of Dunkirk, the lines of men extend into the sea.
 
40.


Nearby, small groups of soldiers attempt to climb onto small vessels. Row boats are being swamped and overturned in the surf, overcrowded boats are grounded on the sand -

MALE VOICE
Right. Three of you out, or the

rest’s stuck.

Soldiers give up their places. Some head back out of the surf. Some wade out past the break...


EXT. BEACH AT MALO LES BAINS - CONTINUOUS

Colonel Winnant walks the beach, surveying. He approaches a group of Engineers driving trucks onto the sand, taking the air out of their tires, laying duckboards on top...

ENGINEER
(brightly)
A pier. When the water comes back

in. Tide’s turning, now.

Colonel Winnant looks out at the churning water.

COLONEL WINNANT
How can you tell?

ENGINEER
(quietly)

The bodies come back.

Colonel Winnant looks out at the water - men in line, chest deep, gently push floating bodies aside as they wash in.

EXT. BEACH AT ZYDECOTTE - CONTINUOUS

Tommy bangs a tin of vegetables on a rock. It springs a leak and he sucks the juice. Gibson holds out his hand. Tommy keeps sucking for a beat or two, then hands it over.

Tommy watches Vanquisher loading troops from the vast crowd lining the mole. Despairing.

Alex opens his eyes and sits up. Spots some Highlanders walking past, away from Dunkirk in loose formation...

ALEX
Hey! Highlanders!

Tommy watches as Alex gets to his feet, heading over to his regimental comrades.
 
41.


ALEX (CONT’D)
What’s that way?

HIGHLANDER 1
(points)

A boat.

Alex follows his gesture to a fishing trawler with a blue cabin, listing in the shallows a mile up the beach.

ALEX
She’s grounded.

HIGHLANDER 2
Not when the tide comes in, she

isn’t.

Tommy and Gibson are already on their feet. Alex nods at them as they follow the highlanders down the beach towards the grounded trawler...

CUT TO:


INT. CABIN, MOONSTONE - DAY

Peter goes down below to check on George. He checks the bleeding on the life jacket behind George’s head.

PETER
What’d you want to come along for,

George?

GEORGE
Sea cadet? You and Mr. Dawson? Best thing I ever done. Only thing I ever done. I told my dad I never done nothing at school. I told my dad I’d do something one day. Maybe get in the local paper.

PETER
The Herald? Why?

GEORGE
Maybe teachers would see it. Make

my school proud.

PETER
(laughs)
Who cares what your bloody school

thinks, George?

George looks up at Peter, desperate.
 
42.


GEORGE
Please! Please! Don’t laugh at me!

Peter looks at George, deciding how to respond.

PETER
I’m going to laugh at you, George - cos you’re being bloody silly.

George is crying.

PETER (CONT’D)
Now, stop it. I need you back up on deck.

George keeps crying.

GEORGE
I can’t. I can’t see.

Peter looks at him. Gets a blanket, puts it across George’s chest.

PETER
Get some rest.

Peter gets up. Looks down at the softly weeping boy.

PETER (CONT’D)
I’ll need you as soon as you’re

able.

George nods. Smiling through his tears.


EXT. MOONSTONE, ENGLISH CHANNEL - DAY

Peter comes up on deck.

The Shivering Soldier, crouched in the well, stares at him. Mr. Dawson is at the helm. Peter comes close. Speaking low -

PETER
The blood won’t stop. Should we

turn back?

Mr. Dawson looks back towards Britain. Then forward to France. Thinking. Shakes his head.

MR. DAWSON
Come too far.

BOOM! Explosions nearby -
 
43.


The Shivering Soldier moves into a foetal position.

Mr. Dawson and Peter look ahead to where plumes of water rise, seemingly in slow motion, amongst the ships up ahead. German bombers drifting overhead, 109 fighters buzzing around them...

Mr. Dawson holds his course...

INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 1 - DAY

Farrier flies, distracted, glancing from his broken fuel gauge to the switch for his reserve fuel tank...

FARRIER

Farrier climbs, trying to gain advantage for the coming encounter, lining up on the German planes threatening the destroyer and the blue trawler...

CUT TO:


EXT. BASE OF THE MOLE - CONTINUOUS

Colonel Winnant makes his way towards the crowded mole. Stretchers of French troops are brought down to the mole. A Private comes out of the crowd, breathless.

PRIVATE
The French’ve been forced back on

the western side, sir.

Colonel Winnant looks at explosions over the warehouses.

COLONEL WINNANT
But they’re still holding

perimeter?

PRIVATE
For now.

Colonel Winnant pushes on down the mole...


EXT. THE MOLE - MOMENTS LATER

He finds Bolton, but no ships...
 
44.


COLONEL WINNANT
Where’re the destroyers?

COMMANDER BOLTON
There’ll be one soon.

COLONEL WINNANT
One?

COMMANDER BOLTON
After yesterday’s losses, it’s one ship on the mole at a time.

COLONEL WINNANT
The battle’s here, what’re they

saving them for?

COMMANDER BOLTON
The next battle. The one for

Britain. Same with the planes.

COLONEL WINNANT
(peers through his field
glasses)
But it’s right there! You can

practically -

COMMANDER BOLTON
Seeing home doesn’t help us get

there, Captain.

Colonel Winnant turns to the flaming town at their backs.

COLONEL WINNANT
They need to send more ships,
dammit! Every hour the enemy pushes

closer.

COMMANDER BOLTON
They’ve activated the small vessels

pool -

COLONEL WINNANT
Vessels pool?

COMMANDER BOLTON
The list of civilian boats for

requisition -

COLONEL WINNANT
Civilian? We need destroyers.
 
45.


COMMANDER BOLTON
Small boats could load from the

beach.

Colonel Winnant watches men struggling to load in the surf.

COLONEL WINNANT
Not in these conditions.

COMMANDER BOLTON
I’d rather face waves than dive

bombers.

Colonel Winnant looks up at the cloudy sky -

COLONEL WINNANT
You’re right - they won’t get up in this...
(points)
The Royal Engineers are building
piers from lorries - should help
when the tide comes back.

COMMANDER BOLTON
We’ll know in six hours.

COLONEL WINNANT
I thought tides were every three?

COMMANDER BOLTON
Then it’s good that you’re army and

I’m navy, isn’t it?

Colonel Winnant allows himself a smile. Commander Bolton spots a shape on the horizon.

COMMANDER BOLTON (CONT’D)
Vanquisher...

CUT TO:


EXT. MOONSTONE, ENGLISH CHANNEL - DAY

Mr. Dawson, at the helm, studies the horizon. Peter joins him, glaring at the Shivering Soldier before taking a seat.

Mr. Dawson hears something, starts scanning the sky...

Spots a distant plane... Peter follows his gaze.

Mr. Dawson throws the wheel, bearing to starboard, hard, throttling up.
 
46.


MR. DAWSON
Heinkel.

Mr. Dawson points at a minesweeper heading towards them...

MR. DAWSON (CONT’D)
They’ll go for the minesweeper.

PETER
Shouldn’t we stand by? To pick up

survivors?

MR. DAWSON
To do that we have to survive

ourselves.

As the boat motors away, Peter looks back to see the Heinkel and its two fighters moving towards the minesweeper...

CUT TO:


EXT. GROUNDED TRAWLER - DAY

The Highlanders approach, cautiously. The beach is deserted here - just disabled army vehicles and dead bodies...

The blue trawler is tilted towards them. They circle the hull, checking it... it seems sound enough.

Tommy and Gibson follow the Highlanders as they climb up onto the abandoned trawler...


EXT. DECK OF GROUNDED TRAWLER - CONTINUOUS

Tommy looks over at the dunes above them. Alex looks around the boat, turns to Highlander 1.

ALEX
Where’s the crew?

HIGHLANDER 1
Probably got spooked after they ran aground. Scarpered up the beach.

ALEX
Why?

HIGHLANDER 2
We’re outside the perimeter. Enemy could be right there -
(points at the dunes)

(MORE)
 
47.

HIGHLANDER 2 (CONT'D) Best shut ourselves inside and wait for the high tide...

Highlanders heads down the companionway into the small hold.

ALEX
How long’s that?

HIGHLANDER 3
Every three hours.

They descend into the hold, shutting the door behind them.

CUT TO:


EXT. MOONSTONE, ENGLISH CHANNEL - DAY

As the Moonstone ploughs through the swell, Peter looks back at the Heinkel coming over the minesweeper...

Peter spots -

PETER
Spitfire! Dad, Spitfire!

Mr. Dawson turns to see two Spitfires diving at the German bomber and its fighter escort. One Spitfire dives right between two 109s, setting one alight.

PETER (CONT’D)
He got him, he got him!!

The other Spitfire flies close over the Heinkel, which turns away from the ship. Mr. Dawson eases back on the speed...

MR. DAWSON
The Heinkel’s moved off...

As they watch, one of the Spitfires starts smoking...

PETER
Oh no...

Mr. Dawson sees the smoke, throws the wheel, spinning the yacht around to head back -

MR. DAWSON
Watch for a parachute!

Mr. Dawson throttles up...

CUT TO:
 
48.


INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 1 - DAY

Farriers hears his engine skip a beat, puts his gloved finger on the reserve tank toggle switch, listening... His engine evens out again. He puts his hand back on the stick, focusing on the German planes...

He throttles up, speeding into the fray, climbing...

CUT TO:


INT. HOLD, GROUNDED TRAWLER - DAY

Dimly lit by a couple of small, dirty portholes.

The soldiers lie around the hold. Sleeping or chatting. Alex is scrounging around the hold, finding nothing useful.

ALEX
(to Gibson)
Poke your head out, see if the

water comes in.

Gibson shakes his head, pulling his arms tight around himself. Alex glares at him -

ALEX (CONT’D)
Talkative sod.

Tommy gets up, climbs up to the door, cracks it. Crawls up into the well - peeks over the rail -

The boat is in inches of water.

TOMMY
Bugger. Barely come in at all.

ALEX
For fuck’s sake.

HIGHLANDER 3
Calm down. What goes out comes back in, right?

ALEX
Yeah, but how long?

Silence answers this. Clearly no sailors aboard.

CUT TO:
 
49.


EXT. MOONSTONE, ENGLISH CHANNEL - DAY

The Moonstone pushes through the swell, full speed, diesel engine straining...

Peter watches the smoke-trailing Spitfire fly lower and lower...

PETER
No parachute...

Mr. Dawson is watching the plane like a hawk, steering around the waves by instinct...


INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 2 - CONTINUOUS

The water flashes by blindingly fast...

Collins pulls back on the stick, raising the nose as the plane -

Hits the water with a jolt and a tearing sound. Collins trashed against his belts, forward/back/left/right -

Bang -


EXT. MOONSTONE - CONTINUOUS

Peter watches the Spitfire ‘land’ on the surface of the water -

PETER
He’s down.


INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 2 - CONTINUOUS

With a shooosh, the plane is floating over the swell, like a sprinter hearing the gun. Collins releases his belts, starts inflating his life vest, pulls the catch on the canopy, yanking it back along its track. It jams... He thrusts his hand through the gap, struggling... From outside it looks like he is waving...

He looks up to see Farrier’s Spitfire shoot over, dipping a swing in salute...

Collins sits in the gently bobbing plane, collecting himself as he watches the water start to rise around the slowly sinking plane.

Collins tries the canopy again -
 
50.


Jammed.

He is trapped in the sinking plane...

CUT TO:


INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 1 - DAY

Farrier levels off, looking down at the Heinkel approaching -

It has a single fighter escort - an ME 109 off the port wing...

CUT TO:


INT. HOLD, GROUNDED TRAWLER - DAY

Tommy jolts awake - there are steps outside. He moves up to the door. Highlander 1 gets his rifle, moves in front of the door. Aims. Nods at Tommy...

Tommy throws open the door. A Seaman stands there -

SEAMAN
Nee, nee!

Highlander 1 is confused.

Tommy grabs the Seaman, pulling him down into the hold. Highlander 1 holds his gun on him -

ALEX
Kraut?

The Seaman looks uncomprehendingly up at Alex -

ALEX (CONT’D)
Are you German?!

SEAMAN
Dutch! Dutch! Merchant navy. Here

to pick you up. To help you.

They sit him up.

ALEX
Why’d you leave your boat?

SEAMAN
In case German come. We wait up the beach with the soldiers. Wait for the tide.
 
51.


HIGHLANDER 2
You came back, the tide must be in.

SEAMAN
Coming, yes. But more hours till we float.

ALEX
Hours?! Why’d you come back?

The Seaman gestures around the packet hold -

SEAMAN
Not so heavy when I left!

Alex and the others take this in.

A gunshot penetrates the hull - everybody lies flat, Tommy stares at the bullet hole, which lets in light...

CUT TO:


EXT. MOONSTONE, ENGLISH CHANNEL - DAY

Mr. Dawson pushes the boat towards where the plane went down.

PETER
There was no ‘chute, dad...

Mr. Dawson ignores him. The engine is screaming...

PETER (CONT’D)
Dad, there was no ‘chute. He’s

probably dead -

MR. DAWSON
(snaps)

Damn it, he might be alive!!

Peter is shocked at his dad’s outburst.

Mr. Dawson stares at where the plane went down...

CUT TO:


INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 1 - DAY

Farrier lines up for his attack... Sighting the Heinkel as it commits to its bombing run over the destroyer, Farrier pushes forward on his stick, going into his dive...

CUT TO:

INT. HOLD, GROUNDED TRAWLER - DAY

Everybody stares at the bullet hole, not making a sound...

Another shot punches a hole two feet from the first -

Highlanders near the holes ease away, squeezing up against the other soldiers...

BANG! A third shot, directly above the first...

Two Highlanders grab their rifles, going for the stairs -

TOMMY
No! Then they’ll know we’re in

here.

HIGHLANDER 1
Why else are they shooting at us?!

TOMMY
Look at the grouping...

Everybody looks at the three bullet holes.

TOMMY (CONT’D)
Target practice.

BANG! A fourth hole, near the others...

CUT TO:


EXT. MOONSTONE, ENGLISH CHANNEL - DAY

The Moonstone is getting closer to the Spitfire bobbing on the waves.

Close enough to see that it is sinking...

MR. DAWSON
Peter, go forward with the boat

hook.


INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 2 - CONTINUOUS

Collins smashes the canopy back and forth on its track...
Jammed, jammed, jammed.

Water starts pouring in, streaming through the gap in the half-open canopy. He shuts it... Trapped... Opens it, yanking, water pouring in...
 
53.


Collins searches around looking for inspiration, for an implement, for anything -

Water rising past his ankles... his calves...

CUT TO:


INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 1 - DAY

Farrier dives, plummeting towards the Heinkel...

He glances across at the 109, which suddenly banks towards him, clearly reacting to Farrier’s attack...


INT. HOLD, GROUNDED TRAWLER - DAY

As the men stare at the bullet holes, water starts slopping through the lowest ones... A Highlander goes to plug the holes.

BANG! The Highlander screams, clutching his face. His comrades pull him back, trying to smother his cries...

The water pours in steadily through the lowest holes. Alex points at the target zone -

ALEX
We have to plug it!

HIGHLANDER 1
After you, mate!

They stay back from the holes, wary. Watching the water pour in...

CUT TO:


INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 2 - DAY

Collins pulls the steel flare gun from its holder. Water is coming up over his legs now... he smashes the flare gun into the canopy, again and again...

CUT TO:


INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 1 - DAY

Farrier fires at the Heinkel. Tracers zipping at the bomber. The 109 rises at him, guns blazing. Farrier rolls away, trying to dodge the fire -
 
54.


EXT. SKY ABOVE DUNKIRK HARBOUR - DAY

As Spitfire 1 rolls way, the Heinkel releases its load - bombs falling around the destroyer -

CUT TO:


INT. HOLD, GROUNDED TRAWLER - DAY

A burst of machine guns fire opens a new group of holes beside the first -

Alex watches the water spraying in. He turns to the Dutch Seaman -

ALEX
How do we get off?! Do we need to

ditch some ballast?!

The Dutch Seaman looks at him, uncomprehending -

ALEX (CONT’D)
Weight! Do we need to lose weight!

The Dutch Seaman shrugs.

SEAMAN
Weight, yes.

Alex turns to face the group -

ALEX
Somebody needs to get off.

HIGHLANDER 1
Well volunteered.

ALEX
We don’t need a volunteer. I know

someone who ought to get off...

Alex turns to Tommy and Gibson. Points at Gibson.

ALEX (CONT’D)
This one. He’s a German spy.

TOMMY
Don’t be daft.

Alex stares Gibson down...
 
55.


ALEX
He’s bloody Jerry. You might not’ve noticed that he hasn’t said a word, but I have. He doesn’t speak English - or if he does it’s with an accent thicker than sauerkraut sauce -

TOMMY
You’re daft. Tell him.

Gibson just stares at Alex...

ALEX
Yeah, tell me.

Nothing. Just the sound of water spraying in hard, jetting in through the bottom holes...

CUT TO:


INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 2 - DAY

Collins smacks the canopy. The flare gun bounces off. He drops the flare gun, scrambles to find it under the water. The water is rising up his chest...

CUT TO:


INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 1 - DAY

Farrier cuts right, dodging away from the 109 -

Banking hard, he gets a clear look at the destroyer weathering the explosions.

A plume of water right next to the destroyer comes so high he flies through the top of its spray.

CUT TO:


INT. HOLD, GROUNDED TRAWLER - DAY

Alex turns to Highlander 1, holds out his hand for his gun. Highlander 1 hands it over. Alex moves to Gibson, pointing the rifle, hooks the barrel on Gibson’s tags, pulling them closer to read -

ALEX
Tell me... Gibson!
 
56.


Tommy looks at Gibson, panicking -

TOMMY
Tell him, for God’s sake!

Alex pushes the rifle against Gibson’s cheek. Gibson cracks -

GIBSON
FRANÇAIS! JE SUIS FRANÇAIS!

Tommy stares, shocked. Alex moves back slightly, taking this in.

A burst of machine-gun fire. Everyone ducks from ricochets.

ALEX
A Frog. A bloody Frog. A cowardly

little queue-jumping Frog...

With the end of his rifle Alex shakes Gibson’s tags -

ALEX (CONT’D)
Who’s Gibson, eh? A naked dead Englishman lying out on that sand. Or did you at least have the decency to bury him?

“Gibson” just stares.

TOMMY
He did. I helped him. I thought it was his mate.

ALEX
Maybe he killed him -

TOMMY
He didn’t kill him -

ALEX
How do we know?!

TOMMY
How hard is it to find a dead Englishman on Dunkirk beach, for God’s sake?! He didn’t kill anyone - he was looking for a way off the damned sand like the rest of us!

The water is spraying in from more and more holes as the water level rises...

Alex has the rifle on Gibson. Another burst of machine-gun fire.
 
57.


HIGHLANDER 2
Hadn’t they had enough practice by now?!

HIGHLANDER 1
They’re making sure she won’t

float.

Highlander 2 looks at the holes spraying water, the water is pooling in the bottom of the hold. He turns to the Seaman -

HIGHLANDER 2
Will she still float?!

The Seaman assesses the leaks...

SEAMAN
Float, yes. With less weight, yes -

ALEX
And we know who’s getting off -

TOMMY
You can’t do that. We’re on the

same side.

Alex nudges Gibson with the rifle -

ALEX
Go on, up you go -

TOMMY
As soon as he pokes his head out

they’ll slaughter him.

ALEX
Better him than me -

TOMMY
It’s not fair -

ALEX
Survival’s not fair.

HIGHLANDER 1
No, it’s shit. It’s fear and greed. Fate squeezed through the bowels of men. Shit.

TOMMY
He saved our lives.
 
58.


HIGHLANDER 2
And he’s about to do it again - Go on -

Alex starts shoving Gibson up the stairs.

TOMMY
No! Just stop!

Alex turns to Tommy, looks him in the eye -

ALEX
We need someone to get off so the
rest of us can live - You want to

volunteer?

TOMMY
Fuck no. I’m going home.

ALEX
And if this is the price?

TOMMY
I’ll live with it, but it’s wrong.

Alex shoves Gibson up another step, opens the door -

TOMMY (CONT’D)
Alex, one man’s not going to make

enough difference -

HIGHLANDER 1
You’d best hope it does, cos you’d be volunteering next -

TOMMY
What?

ALEX
(indicate Highlanders)
We’re regimental brothers, mate.

Just the way it is.

Gibson grabs for the rifle. Tommy jumps at Alex to help Gibson. They smash against the hull - as they drop into the water, the ship levels -

SEAMAN
FLOAT! WE FLOAT!

HIGHLANDER 2
START THE BLOODY ENGINE!

The Seaman is already crawling out the hatch, reaching up -
 
59.


The engine starts, loud as loud can be -

Machine-gun fire strafes the hull. The men duck below the waterline...

The Seaman throws the screw into reverse, full throttle...

The men hold their breaths under the water at the bottom of the hold as bullets pepper the hull...

CUT TO:


INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 2 - DAY

Collins, water up ti his ears now, grabs the flare gun - swinging underwater less effective.

Now he panics, pushing his face up against the canopy, banging with his fists, instinct taking over, no more thought, no more plan - banging, banging, water rising over his ears. Smash - something cracks into the canopy right above his head. He recoils. It impacts the canopy again, smashing the hole -

It is a boat hook...

Collins pulls himself through the hole, elbow first, forcing himself through, pushing off his seat, underwater, he pushes up from the sinking plane...


EXT. WATER, JUST OUTSIDE DUNKIRK HARBOUR - CONTINUOUS

Collins breaks the surface, gasping, looks around -

A private yacht with a young man on the bow, boat hook extended...

Collins grasps the boat hook.

COLLINS
(breathless)

Afternoon.

CUT TO:


INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 1 - DAY

Farrier comes around again, searching the sky for the German planes...
 
60.


He looks down at the destroyer. It is leaking oil from a large hole in its side...

The dark oil slick spreads quickly across the water, covering
the men in the water between the trawler and the destroyer...

CUT TO:


EXT. THE MOLE - DAY

The destroyer Basilisk casts off. Men cover every available piece of deck.

Commander Bolton watches her wake. Colonel Winnant approaches -

COLONEL WINNANT
We’ve wasted the day, Commander.

COMMANDER BOLTON
I share your frustration, Colonel.

They hear distant shots -

Commander Bolton raises his field glasses... He sees a blue trawler stuck in the shallows miles down the beach.

COMMANDER BOLTON (CONT’D)
Grounded trawler, taking fire.

Colonel Winnant takes the field glasses...

COLONEL WINNANT
The enemy’s breaking through the

dunes to the east. This is it.


INT. HOLD, GROUNDED TRAWLER - DAY

Tommy comes up for air, gasping, spluttering...

Water is pouring in from dozens and dozens of holes...

Alex comes up, coughing, with Gibson...

ALEX
We’re off!

Alex crawls over to the stairs, climbs out into the well -
 
61.


EXT. TRAWLER - CONTINUOUS

Alex pokes his head out as the Seaman is sneaking up to see where they are headed -

The Dutch Seaman turns the wheel, jumps back onto the floor of the well as bullets impact the cabin. He throws the engine into forward gear, turns to Alex -

DUTCH SEAMAN
THE HOLES! PLUG THE HOLES!

Alex crawls back downstairs -


INT. HOLD, TRAWLER - CONTINUOUS

Alex falls down the stairs -

ALEX
PLUG THE HOLES! PLUG THE HOLES!

The men stuff rags, bolts, fingers, anything they can lay hands on to plug as many holes as possible...

CUT TO:


INT. CABIN, MOONSTONE - MOMENTS LATER

Collins, drying himself with a blanket, looks down at George, whose breathing is shallow, sightless eyes open.

COLLINS
(to Peter)

I don’t really know, son. You were right not to move him.
(reassuring)
You’ve done the best for him you

can.


EXT. MOONSTONE, WATER OUTSIDE DUNKIRK HARBOUR - CONTINUOUS

The Shivering Soldier watches Collins come out on deck -

SHIVERING SOLDIER
Is he alright?

PETER (O.S.)
No.

Peter is glaring at the Shivering Soldier.
 
62.


PETER (CONT’D)
No, he’s not -

BOOM! Collins follows Mr. Dawson’s gaze to a destroyer up ahead being bombed by a Heinkel, huge plumes of water rising just beside her.

The Shivering Soldier retreats into himself. Peter runs up to the bow -

A blue fishing trawler a quarter of a mile off, sinking...

PETER (CONT’D)
Dad, there’s men in the water!

Mr. Dawson looks ahead to where Peter is pointing. He puts the throttle forward, heading into the fray...

Collins spots Spitfire 1 arcing around, trying to get a bead on the Heinkel...

COLLINS
Come on, Farrier...

CUT TO:


INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 1 - DAY

Farrier pulls on the stick, lining up behind a 109...

He fires, chasing down the plane, firing again... Smoke from the German plane, which starts to drop...

Farrier is in a heavy dive, when his engine chokes.

Farrier’s hand darts forward, switching to his reserve tank before the engine can die...

The engine catches again. Farrier pulls out of the dive...

CUT TO:


EXT. THE MOLE - DAY

Through the binoculars Colonel Winnant watches the blue trawler pushing out to the sea, low in the water...

Commander Bolton watches a destroyer, under full steam, heading out to the Channel...

Where there are shapes of boats on the horizon...
 
63.


EXT. DECK OF TRAWLER - CONTINUOUS

The Dutch Seaman aims the boat at a destroyer out at the mouth of the harbour...


EXT. HOLD, TRAWLER - DAY

Tommy, Gibson, Alex, Highlander 1 and the others stuff the holes as best they can. The makeshift plugs pop out every few seconds - the soldiers scrabble under water to find them and stuff them back in, hands pressed against water jets, spray coming in everywhere...


EXT. THE MOLE - CONTINUOUS

Omitted.*

*	In previous drafts of the script, this is the point at which Bolton and Winnant first see the Little Ships. Ultimately in the cutting room, they returned the entrance of the Little Ships to this location in the film.


EXT. DECK OF TRAWLER - CONTINUOUS

The Dutch Seaman looks over the rail, concerned, to see how fast his boat is lowering into the swell...

CUT TO:


EXT. MOONSTONE, WATER OUTSIDE DUNKIRK HARBOUR - DAY

Collins watches Farrier spin around to get after the Heinkel.

The Moonstone comes up on the men in the water. Collins comes to the side, to help Peter fish men out, notices the surface of the water -

COLLINS
(to Mr. Dawson)

Oil. We’re getting into oil!

Mr. Dawson puts the screw into reverse, stopping the boat.

They fish men out of the water - the men covered in oil, anonymous in their glossy black filth...

CUT TO:
 
64.


INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 1 - DAY

Farrier chases down the Heinkel, closing in as its top turret opens up on him, tracer fire lighting up all around him -

He dives down under the range of the rear turret, then angles up, firing at the bomber’s tail...

CUT TO:


EXT. BLUE TRAWLER - DAY

The Dutch Seaman sees water sloshing over the deck.

DUTCH SEAMAN
ABANDON SHIP! ABANDON SHIP!


INT. HOLD, TRAWLER - CONTINUOUS

The soldiers, holding back the water, cannot hear him... One by one they start to abandon the task. More and more water pouring in... Alex and Gibson are last - Alex turns, sees they are alone, grabs Gibson by the shoulder then jumps for the exit. Gibson, still holding back the water, notices too late -


EXT. BLUE TRAWLER 0 C

Tommy gets on deck, sees the Keith, a quarter of a mile away. He dives into the water, pulling away from the swamped trawler -

All the men dive off the sinking boat, swimming for the Keith.


INT. HOLD, TRAWLER - CONTINUOUS

Gibson dives for the exit. He is blasted back by water, dragged down with the sinking trawler...

CUT TO:


EXT. MOONSTONE, WATER OUTSIDE DUNKIRK HARBOUR - DAY

Peter, Collins and the first oil-covered men pull more oily men from the water, the decks of the yacht rapidly filling. Mt. Dawson looks at the oil slick, concerned. He addresses the oily survivors -
 
65.


MR. DAWSON
Below deck.

OILY SURVIVOR
No fear.

MR. DAWSON
We need to get as many of you on board as we can before the oil catches fire. Get below or get off my boat - your choice.

The oily survivors head below decks. Peter runs back to the companionway to shout down -

PETER
Careful there!


INT. CABIN, MOONSTONE - CONTINUOUS

Peter pokes his head down, sees two oily survivors moving George from the bottom of the steps =

PETER
Careful!

The oily survivors look up at him. Alex is one of them -

ALEX
(quiet)

He’s dead, mate.

Peter takes this in...

PETER
So be bloody careful with him!


EXT. THE MOLE - CONTINUOUS

Commander Bolton stares at the shapes in the distance...

He grabs the field glasses from Colonel Winnant, puts them to his eyes -

Boats. Civilian boats. All shapes and sizes. An armada.

Colonel Winnant peers over Commander Bolton’s shoulder...

COLONEL WINNANT
What can you see?

Commander Bolton slowly lowers the glasses.
 
66.


COMMANDER BOLTON
(gentle)

Home.

Colonel Winnant grabs the glasses, confused...


EXT. DECK OF DESTROYER - CONTINUOUS

The soldiers peer over the railing at the absurd collection of vessels passing them in the opposite direction:

Yacht, paddle steamers, fishing trawlers, day sailors, ferries, dredgers, dinghies, row boats...

Crewed by:

Fisherman, merchant navy sailors, naval officers, civilian crew, naval crew, nurses, retired sailors...

The exhausted soldiers lining the decks of the Basilisk start to clap, then to cheer... Some are crying...


EXT. MOONSTONE, WATER OUTSIDE DUNKIRK HARBOUR - CONTINUOUS

Peter steps out of the cabin, reeling. Meets his dad’s questioning glance with unmistakable shock -

SHIVERING SOLDIER (O.S.)
The lad...

Peter turns. The Shivering Soldier is looking up at him with terrified eyes, blanket tight around his shoulders.

SHIVERING SOLDIER (O.S.) (CONT’D)
Will he be okay?

Peter looks at the Shivering Soldier. Sees the white knuckles clasping the edge of the rough blanket. Peter nods.

The Shivering Soldier turns, staring out at the destroyer.

Peter catches Mr. Dawson looking at him. Approving.

Collins, pulling a man from the water, looks up at the Spitfire 1 chasing down the Heinkel -

COLLINS
Come on, Farrier...

CUT TO:
 
67.


INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 1 - DAY

Farrier strafes the Heinkel - no apparent effect. Zipping over it, he dives down out of range of its turret, banks hard left to line up another shot. A 109 cuts across him, Tracer fire shooting past.

CUT TO:


EXT. WATER, JUST OUTSIDE DUNKIRK HARBOUR - DAY

Tommy swims for the Keith...

He hears an airplane... looks up to see a Heinkel coming in over the Keith... The bombs drop, plumes of water shoot upwards all around the ship. Tommy dives under the water for protection. The explosions are deafening - he holds his ears with his hands -

Tommy breaks the surface. The barrage is over, the Keith is still afloat. Tommy swims for it. Getting closer, Tommy realizes he’s swimming oil, the black sludge covering his head and arms. He looks back - the blue trawler is gently slipping beneath the water...

Tommy makes for the Keith, even as he sees men jumping into the water from her decks, lifeboats being lowered...

Tommy spots another craft - a yacht heading towards them.
Tommy pulls for the yacht as hard as he can...

CUT TO:


EXT. BEACH AT MALO LES BAINS - CONTINUOUS

The rag-tag collection of small ships works the beach, picking men up in the shallows, ferrying them out to bigger ships...

Small open boats use the truck ‘pier’ to load men as the Engineer looks on with pride...


EXT. MOONSTONE, WATER OUTSIDE DUNKIRK HARBOUR - DAY

The Moonstone is filled with oil-covered men, throughout the hold and across the decks - many more still in the water.

The Keith lists, men jump off the far side, away from the oil slick, where small ships are gathering to pick them up...
 
68.


Collins moves up the side, watching Farrier bank hard to get behind the Heinkel. A 109 zips across his path, guns blazing...

Collins looks down at the oil-covered water...


INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 1 - CONTINUOUS

Farrier pulls around, hard. The Heinkel is in front of him, side on, heading in for another run at the Keith.

Farrier banks and pulls up to keep the bomber in his sights as he fires his cannons -

The Heinkel catches fire and starts falling...


EXT. MOONSTONE, WATER OUTSIDE DUNKIRK HARBOUR - CONTINUOUS

Collins sees the heinkel catch fire - turns to Mr. Dawson.

COLLINS
GO! GO! GO!

Mr. Dawson throws the engine into gear, turns the wheel -

The Heinkel falls flaming towards the oil slick...

Peter has hold of one last oil-covered survivor, who hangs on for dear life as the boat drags him through the oily water -

The men left in the water shout with despair as the Moonstone motors away -

The flaming Heinkel hits the water - explodes -

The surface of the water catches fire, spreading across the water. Men duck underwater to escape the flames.

Underwater: Highlander 1 pushes down under, looking up at the fire. The surface is aflame as far as he can see...

Peter holds on to the oil-covered soldier -

Who is now being washed with cleaner water as they come out of the slick. As the oil comes off his face we see that it is Tommy...

Collins watches, appalled, as the men in the water are engulfed by relentless flames... The Keith is going down - survivors on the far side are picked up by the various small ships...
 
69.


Under the water, Highlander 1’s air runs out. The flames rage above...

His instinct to breath pushes him up into the flames where he is engulfed, screaming, dying -

Tommy lies on the deck at Peter’s feet, eyes closed...

TOMMY
(a whisper)

Take me home.

CUT TO:


INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 1 - DAY

Farrier sees the Heinkel explode, turns away towards the beaches...

He looks down at -

The thousands of men on the beach.

The small ships ferrying out to the larger vessels.

The narrow mole with its endless rope of men...

Farrier is awestruck...

He hears his engine starts to sputter...

It dies and the prop stops...


EXT. THE MOLE - CONTINUOUS

Commander Bolton watches with satisfaction as a paddle steamer ties up. He calls up to a Stewardess (fifty-nine) -

COMMANDER BOLTON
Where’s you from?

STEWARDESS
Out of Dartmouth!

Bolton shakes his head in joyous disbelief. He watches men load into a small open sailboat crewed by two young men.

COMMANDER BOLTON
From Deal?

They nod.
 
70.


COMMANDER BOLTON (CONT’D) Mind the current at the mouth, boys.

Bolton spots Spitfire 1. It soars overhead. He waves -

MALE VOICE (O.S.)
Where’ve you all been all my life?!

Commander Bolton sighs at this... then notices. No engine noise.

He watches the Spitfire, concerned, until -

Hears something - another engine... A high whine... He turns to see -

A Stuka...

The men lining the mole shift restlessly. Trapped...

CUT TO:


EXT. MOONSTONE, ENGLISH CHANNEL - EVENING

The Moonstone chugs along, low in the water, men laying down along her decks...


INT. CABIN, MOONSTONE - CONTINUOUS

Men lie on every available space, packed in like sardines.
Tommy catches sight of Alex looking at him. Tommy nods.


EXT. MOONSTONE, ENGLISH CHANNEL - CONTINUOUS

Mr. Dawson is at the helm. Collins hears a distant engine -

COLLINS
That’s a fighter -

MR. DAWSON
ME 109, from the South. Peter, take the wheel, listen for my instructions.

Mr. Dawson steps up onto the seat to look above the roof of the cabin...

MR. DAWSON (CONT’D)
Point her south.
 
71.


Peter turns the wheel, the Moonstone swings to port,
straightens up. Mr. Dawson spots the 109, closing...

CUT TO:


EXT. THE MOLE - DAY

Commander Bolton turns to see the Stuka approaching, its distinctively kinked-wing silhouette bearing down like an awful bird of prey...

The soldiers stir, some crouching, some closing their eyes. Commander Bolton takes a knee, bracing. He bites his lip as the Stuka goes into its dive, that terrible whine building...

CUT TO:


EXT. MOONSTONE, ENGLISH CHANNEL - EVENING

Mr. Dawson stares at the approaching 109-

MR. DAWSON
Full speed ahead.

Peter throttles up -

The 109 is growing close now...

MR. DAWSON (CONT’D) Get ready to pull hard to port... before he fires he’ll have to lower his nose, I’ll give you the signal...

Peter reaches over to the side of the wheel, ready to throw it. The 109 is practically upon them...

CUT TO:


EXT. THE MOLE - DAY

Commander Bolton is mumbling a prayer as he watches the Stuka come at them -

BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM!!

The Stuka is strafed with fire as Spitfire 1 flashes past -
 
72.


INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 1 - CONTINUOUS

Farrier darts past the Stuka, gliding, guns blazing...


EXT. THE MOLE - CONTINUOUS

The Stuka never fires, it just smashes into the sea... The soldiers all along the mole cheer.


INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 1 - CONTINUOUS

Farrier watches the Stuka disintegrate on the surface of the water. He nods... feeling the unaccustomed silence...

CUT TO:


EXT. MOONSTONE, ENGLISH CHANNEL - EVENING

Mr. Dawson stares at the approaching 109. Peter glances back and forth between the 109 and his father...

MR. DAWSON
Wait for it... wait till he’s

committed to his line...

The nose of the 109 dips down -

MR. DAWSON (CONT’D)
NOW!

Peter throws the wheel, the Moonstone lurches to port -

The guns on the 109 light up, strafing the water to starboard -

The 109 flashes over... Collins watches it recede.

COLLINS
He’s off.

MR. DAWSON
Bigger fish to fry.

Collins looks at Mr. Dawson. Curious.

COLLINS
How’d you know all that, anyway?

Mr. Dawson steps onto the deck.
 
73.


MR. DAWSON
My son’s one of you lot. I knew

he’d see us through.

Mr. Dawson moves forward. Collins steps up beside Peter.

COLLINS
You’re RAF?

MR. DAWSON
Not me. My brother. Flew
Hurricanes. He died third week into

the war.

Collins looks forward at the proud father standing by the mast.

CUT TO:


INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 1 - DAY

Farrier sits in the silence, gliding... looking to see how far he might make it up the beach...

CUT TO:


INT. CABIN, MOONSTONE - EVENING

Tommy gets to his feet, steps over other men as he slips over to the stairs...


EXT. MOONSTONE, ENGLISH CHANNEL - EVENING

Tommy and Alex poke their heads out -

PETER
Stay below, please.

TOMMY
We just want to see the cliffs -

Tommy looks over at white cliffs, ghostly above the dark water.

TOMMY (CONT’D)
Dover?

Peter shakes his head, amused.

PETER
Weymouth.
 
74.


Alex shakes his head, sadly.

ALEX
We let you all down, didn’t we?

Peter just looks at this exhausted, ragged boy his own age.

CUT TO:


INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 1 - DAY

Farrier glides, banking, looking for a suitable stretch of beach to ditch...

In the strangely silent plane, he passes over the troops, lines up on the vast stretch of sand beyond Malo Les Bains...

CUT TO:


EXT. HARBOUR AT WEYMOUTH - NIGHT

Soldier after soldier climbs out of the yacht. The Corporal handing out travel chits marvels at the absurd amount...

CORPORAL
How many you got in there?

The Shivering Soldier is taken ashore, wrapped in blankets.

Tommy and Alex stick together as they are handed hot cups of tea and shepherded out of the harbour in long lines.

Peter supervises as George’s body is taken ashore.

As Collins steps off the boat a soldier from another boat spots his RAF uniform -

SOLDIER
(furious)

Where the hell were you!

Collins just stands there. He feels a hand on his shoulder. It is Mr. Dawson. He indicates the men filing off the Moonstone -

MR. DAWSON
They know here you were.

Mr. Dawson puts his hat on. To go home.
 
75.


EXT. WEYMOUTH RAIL YARD - NIGHT

Tommy and Alex, exhausted, downcast, are herded across the tracks towards a train. Before getting on they are handed a blanket and cup of tea by an Elderly Man, who looks at their hands, not their faces, as he hands the rough blankets over -

ELDERLY MAN
Well done, lads... well done,

lads...

ALEX
All we did is survive.

ELDERLY MAN
That’s enough. Well, done, lads,

well done, lads...

Alex steps up onto the train. The Elderly Man reaches out to Tommy, touching his face - clearly blind.


INT. TRAIN - CONTINUOUS

Tommy flops down, lying across the seat. Alex is slumped opposite, tears starting to roll down his cheeks.

ALEX
That old bloke wouldn’t even look

us in the eye.

No response. He looks over. Tommy is already asleep.

CUT TO:


EXT. THE MOLE - EVENING

The mole is empty but for bodies.

A Private opens his eyes. He sits up, alone on the deserted mole, his comrades gone, mistaken for dead...

COMMANDER BOLTON (O.S.)
Come on, then, Private...

The Private looks down at the water to see Commander Bolton standing in a launch full of army officers.

COMMANDER BOLTON (CONT’D) I know we’re officers, but it’s us or the enemy, so now’s not the time to be particular...
 
76.


The Private scrambles down into the launch, where Colonel Winnant stands talking to Commander Bolton.

They look out at the vast deserted beach, littered with corpses and abandoned equipment...

COLONEL WINNANT
(to Commander Bolton)

Churchill got his thirty thousand.

COMMANDER BOLTON
And then some. Almost three hundred thousand. So far.

Commander Bolton steps back up onto the mole.

COLONEL WINNANT
So far?

COMMANDER BOLTON
I’m staying.
(off look)

For the French.

The launch pulls away from Commander Bolton on the mole.

CUT TO:


INT. TRAIN - MORNING

Sunlight flickering on Tommy’s eyelids wakes him. We have the sense that he has been asleep for a very long time.

The train full of soldiers rolls to a halt. Alex opens the window, spots a Boy near the tracks -

ALEX
Hey! Where are we?!

BOY
Siding. You’ll put in in a minute -

ALEX
What station?

BOY
(surprised)

Woking.

Alex spots stacks of newspapers waiting to be loaded.

ALEX
Grab me one of them papers.
 
77.


The Boy hesitates.

ALEX (CONT’D)
Go on!

The Boy pulls the paper off the top and stretches up to hand it to Alex. Alex slumps into his seat. The headline:

CHURCHILL ADDRESSES DUNKIRK EVACUATION
IN COMMONS

Alex thrusts the paper at Tommy.

ALEX (CONT’D)
I can’t bear it. You read it.

TOMMY
Can’t bear it?

ALEX
They’ll be spitting at us in the
streets. If they’re not locked up

waiting for the invasion.

CUT TO:


EXT. WEYMOUTH TOWN - DAY

Peter walks down the deserted high street. He stops. Walks into the office of the local paper, the Herald...

Farrier checks his canopy is locked, stows loose items, pumping the handle all the while...

The landing gear inches out of its housing...

78.


INT. TRAIN - DAY

Tommy looks down at the paper. Starts to read. Poorly.

TOMMY
“Wars are not won by evacuations.”

Alex shakes his head at this.

The train starts to pull into the station...

The platforms is crowded with civilians. Alex slinks down into his seat, turning away from the window...

A Civilian bangs on the glass, peering in...

ALEX
I can’t look,

TOMMY
“But there was a victory inside
this deliverance which should be

noted...”

Alex turns. The Civilian grins, holding up two beer bottles.
The platform is packed with cheering and waving civilians...

Women with sandwiches and drinks rush up to the windows...

TOMMY (CONT’D)
“Our thankfulness at the escape of our army -”

Alex opens the window , grabbing food and drink as Tommy continues to read...

TOMMY (CONT’D)
“- Must not blind us to the fact
that what has happened in France...

is a colossal military disaster...”


INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 1 - DAY

Farrier pumps the handle -

The landing gear inches past halfway down...
 
79.


INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 1 - CONTINUOUS

Pumping the handle, Farrier checks his belts -

TOMMY (V.O.)
“And we must expect another blow to be struck almost immediately...”

Farrier holds the plane steady in its descent towards the sands...


EXT. BEACH AT LA PANNE - CONTINUOUS

Spitfire 1 swoops onto the flat sand, wheels down.

TOMMY (V.O.)
“We shall go on to the end, we

shall fight in France...”

Farrier slides back the canopy and climbs out of the plan...


INT. MR. DAWSON’S HOME - DAY

Peter, gets up from the kitchen. Mrs. Dawson is at the stove, her back to us.

As Peter grabs his coat he runs into Mr. Dawson, letters in hand, looking at the Herald. He hands it to Peter...

TOMMY (V.O.)
“We shall fight on the seas and

oceans...”

The small headline:


LOCAL BOY, GEORGE MILLS, JUST 17,
HERO AT DUNKIRK

Peter looks at his father. Nods with satisfaction.


EXT. BEACH AT LA PANNE - DAY

Farrier brushes sand from the wing of his beloved Spitfire...

TOMMY (V.O.)
“We shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air...”

Farrier pulls his flare gun... He shoots into the cockpit...
 
80.


INT. TRAIN - DAY

Alex hangs out of the window, guzzling from a beer bottle, grinning at the women outside...

TOMMY
“We shall defend our island...”

Alex turns, deliriously happy, beer running down his chin -

ALEX
What?!

TOMMY
(louder, over the
celebration)

“We shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be - we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds...”


EXT. DUNKIRK HARBOUR - EVENING

Bodies gently bob in the water...

TOMMY (V.O.)
“We shall fight in the fields and

the streets...”

Abandoned trucks and anti-aircraft guns, piles of boots, stacks of rifles catch the last light...

TOMMY (V.O.)
“We shall fight in the hills; we

shall never surrender...”

Bodies line the length of the mole...

TOMMY (V.O.)
‘And even if, which I do not for a moment believe, this island... were subjugated and starving...”


EXT. BEACH AT LA PANNE - CONTINUOUS

Farrier kneels, hands on head, as dark shapes of German soldiers (seen only from behind) surround him...
 
81.


TOMMY (V.O.)
“Then our empire beyond the seas,
armed and guarded by the British
fleet, would carry on the

struggle...”

Farrier is led away from the burning plane...


INT. TRAIN - DAY

Alex is oblivious. Tommy continues, to himself...

TOMMY
“Until, in God’s good time...”


EXT. BEACH AT LA PANNE - CONTINUOUS

Moving towards the burning Spitfire...

TOMMY (V.O.)
“The New World, with all its power and might -”

The shape of the plane is still visible beneath the flames...

TOMMY (V.O.)
“- Steps forth to the rescue and

the liberation of the old”.

Move in on the burning Spitfire until the flames fill the frame and we -
