The sun-spotted hand of an old man adjusts a radio dial.
RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
(on radio)
It's a beautiful jackpot of a day here in Las Vegas and, you guessed it, the biggest song of 1997... 
The jaunty Euro hit "Macarena!" plays as a frail, corpulent MAN ascends a ladder and strains to lift a box marked, "CHRISTMAS CARDS, 1997."
Annoyed by the music, he flicks the dial again: ear-splitting white noise.
THUD! He crashes onto the floor. CHRISTMAS CARDS are splayed around him.
OLD COLONEL (V.O.) I know what you're thinking...  who the hell is this Colonel fellow?
The man's fleshy, grey face gasping desperately. This is COLONEL TOM PARKER (87).
We TRACK ACROSS him to the Christmas cards: a portrait of Elvis, magnificent, king-like, beside the old man dressed in an ill-fitting Santa suit. An inscription reads: "Merry Christmas, from Elvis and the Colonel."
SMASH CUT TO:

TILT UP as a still corpulent, but younger, 64-YEAR-OLD COLONEL enters, brandishing his elephant-headed cane. He takes in the situation before him.
Elvis has collapsed on the floor. His bodyguards, SONNY and Red West, hold staff at bay. Childhood friend JERRY SCHILLING shoots a recriminating glance at the Colonel.
NURSE TISH suppresses panic as DR. NICK holds Elvis’ head above a bucket of ice water. Everyone looks to Colonel.
OLD COLONEL (V.O.)
That's right. It was me who killed
Elvis Presley.
Colonel’s steely gaze. A frightening moment of consideration as we hear... 
COLONEL
Now, you listen up real good. The

that man gets on that stage
tonight!
But then, Nurse Tish pipes up courageously.
NURSE TISH
If he was my son... 
She glances to a grey-haired man with a pencil mustache arriving meekly in the shadows. This is VERNON PRESLEY (57). Elvis’ father.
NURSE TISH

The Colonel jolts upward.
OLD COLONEL
No!...  It's not true. I didn't
kill him...  I loved him. I didn’t
kill him. But I know who did.
He looks up to the morphine drip. The BEEP, BEEP of the heart monitor transforms into a MUSICAL PULSE as morphine snakes down a plastic tube into the Colonel's arm.
OLD COLONEL
It weren’t me... 
Colonel slowly pulls back the bedsheets and stands, taking his IV stand with him. We TRACK ACROSS get well paraphernalia. A red balloon appears, seemingly part of the get well gifts. Colonel is drawn toward it.
OLD COLONEL
And it weren’t nothing to do with
what them dirt farmers and
muckrakers wrote up in all them
books.
The beat kicks in, balloon in one hand, IV stand in the other. He shuffles down the corridor to the music.
OLD COLONEL
Evil manager? I wasn't his
manager! I was his promoter! It
was my job to present him to you.
To sell, package, and make money

CUT TO a gold curtain rising to reveal: Old Colonel, now resplendent in a striped blazer, every inch the carnival barker, miming along to a contemporary, orchestral version of Elvis' song, "Carnival Time." Colonel sashays and warbles down a staircase into SPACE.

Colonel, now with a stick-and-bindle over his shoulder, runs along a WIGGLY CARPET that leads to a far-away model of a 1930s carnival.
OLD COLONEL
As an orphan, I ran away to the
carnival, where I learned my

PUSH IN on a red curtain touting "Tom Parker's Famous Dancing Chickens."

Chickens!
Curtains fly open to reveal Old Colonel in front of a stage on which ordinary chickens cluck about. A band plays side-stage. A group of RUBES watches, intrigued.

high-kicking chorus line of the
Barnyard Ballet!

Now then...  the snow job! The art
of emptying a rube’s wallet while
leaving them with nothing but a
smile on their face.
As the plates heat up, the chickens appear to dance. The rubes applaud! A mystical, minor-chord version of "Carnival Time" begins.
OLD COLONEL
It was also in the carnival that I

OLD COLONEL
Of course, any promoter is limited

Prophetic words. Hank Snow, such a

Looking on from the wings: an identically-dressed 19-year-old version of Hank, JIMMIE RODGERS SNOW.
OLD COLONEL
And his hapless son, Jimmie
Rodgers Snow.
An abstract version of Elvis' "That's All Right" begins to overwhelm the sound of Hank's voice. With the turn of the Ferris wheel, night becomes day... 
EXT. CARNIVAL - DAY (1955)
Carnies pack up the carnival, tawdry in the morning light. The abstract “That’s All Right“ transforms into the original song, emanating in mono from a car radio.
CRANE DOWN to discover Jimmie Rodgers Snow, clutching a record as he passes a gum-chewing teenager in the cab of a truck. He flashes the record.

EXT. SUN STUDIOS - DUSK (1954)
A converted shopfront. A neon sign reads: “SUN STUDIOS. HAVE YOUR VOICE RECORDED -- ONE DOLLAR!” The music from the Pentecostal church continues underneath.
Marion crosses the road to the studio, carrying coffee and donuts.
OLD COLONEL (V.O.)
But it didn’t pay, so he tried to
find a white country-and-western
star.

INT. SUN STUDIOS - CONTROL ROOM - DUSK
We follow Marion as she passes Scotty, Bill and the young boy in the studio. Scotty is packing up his guitar.
SCOTTY
Sorry kid, I’ve got to work
tomorrow.
Marion enters the control room and plonks a coffee down in front of Sam, despondent at the control desk.
SAM
I don’t know what it is you see in
this boy... 
Marion looks up. Although they can't hear, she can see Elvis larking around in the studio.
MARION
I just think he’s...  different.
She flicks a switch. An intrigued Sam looks up and rises to his feet.
INT. SUN STUDIOS - RECORDING ROOM - LATER
Sam, Marion, Scotty and Bill looking at Elvis, a moment of shocked pause. Sam repositions the microphone in front of Elvis.
SAM PHILLIPS
How do you know Big Boy Crudup?
Elvis shrugs. He starts to sing “That's Alright, Mama” over the Pentecostal music. Scotty and Bill join...  CUT TO hours later, the musicians are shaping up the track.
INT. "HAYRIDE” AUDITORIUM - NIGHT (1955)
Elvis and the boys make their way inside. Using instruments being loaded through the dock door as cover, Colonel positions himself to get as close as possible.
As Elvis and the boys prepare to take the stage, Colonel begins to ascend the stairs to the fly tower above.
INT. PENTECOSTAL TENT - AFTERNOON (1947)
The singing reaches a powerful crescendo as Young Elvis is possessed by the sacred and the profane.

ELVIS (V.O.)
(in Sun Studios)
That's all right, mama... 
The distant and dreamlike sound of HORACE LOGAN’s voice:
HORACE LOGAN (V.O.)
A young man from Memphis,
Tennessee...  song on the Sun
label...  sky-rocketed right up the
charts...  Elvis Presley! Let's
give him a nice hand.
Tepid applause takes us to... 
INT. "HAYRIDE” AUDITORIUM - STAGE - NIGHT (1955)
CLOSE ON Elvis’ shaking legs. TILT UP to DISCOVER a pink jacket over feminine black lace. A white-hot spotlight REVEALS his face: heavy with makeup, slumberous, piercing, blue eyes stare back. His greasy black hair is an architectural wonder and slashes across his forehead like a scar.
This is ELVIS PRESLEY at 20. He is beautiful, defiant, innocent, strange.
OLD COLONEL (V.O.)
I cannot overstate how strange he
looked. I'd seen clowns with less
makeup.
The Colonel looks out into the auditorium. Bodies shifting in rickety chairs. Portraits of disdain, disgust, and confusion. The South as it stands, soon to be changed forever.
HORACE LOGAN (O.S.)
Elvis, how are you this evening?
ELVIS
Just fine. How're you, sir?
HORACE LOGAN
Are you all geared up with your
band there to... 
ELVIS
I'm all geared up.
HORACE LOGAN
...  to let us hear your songs?
Elvis, flustered, realizes he’s cut Horace off.

ELVIS
Uh, well, I'd just like to say how
happy we are to be down here. It's
a real honor for us to be- get a
chance to appear on the Louisiana
Hayride. We're gonna do a song for
you we got out on Sun Records... 
you got anything else to say, Sir?
HORACE LOGAN
No, I'm ready!
Elvis looks up to the heavens... 
ELVIS
It goes something like this... 
At the front of the auditorium, an anxious Vernon stares at the floor. Beside him, Gladys stares into the eyes of her son. This does not go unnoticed by the Colonel.
Elvis’ chest heaves, mind races, heart pounds.
ELVIS
(sings)
Ohh, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby... 
Snickers from the audience.
The Colonel puffs his cigar, eyes narrow. Maybe this boy's not for the stage.
ELVIS
(sings)
Come back, baby, I wanna play
house with you.
In the front row, two of the country kids from the side alley: pretty-girl NELL and her skinny country jock boyfriend, TOMMY, chewing gum and smirking--
TOMMY
Get a haircut, fairy!
A flash of anger across Elvis’ face. He wails back:
ELVIS
(sings)
Weeeeeellll, you may go to
college, you may go to school,
You may have a pink Cadillac,
But don't you be nobody's fool.

A cluster of girls in the front start to clap and wriggle in their chairs excitedly. Colonel climbs the ladder to the gantry.
ELVIS
(sings)
Now, baby, come back, baby, come.
Come back, baby come... 
CAMERA CURLS DOWN Elvis’ body, revealing what all the fuss is about.
ELVIS
(sings)
Come back, baby, I want to play
house with you!
Elvis’ raw nervous energy has caused his habitually shaky leg to go into overdrive! The front of his pleated, pegged pants flaps like a tent in a storm.
Fascinated, Colonel begins to cross the gantry for a better vantage point.
ELVIS
(sings)
Well, listen to me, baby
What I’m talking about... 
The unpegged pants seem to suggest, and maybe it's true, that all hell is breaking loose down there.
ELVIS
(sings)
Come on back to me, little girl
So we can play some house.
A GIRL in the audience SCREAMS! Elvis and the band falter, confused by the reaction.
ELVIS
(sings)
Now baby, come back baby, come
Come back baby, come... 
Marion Keisker shushes the girl who screamed, beside her.
ELVIS
(sings)
Come back baby
I wanna play house with you... 
But then there’s ANOTHER SCREAM, and then ANOTHER, mixed with an uncertain laughter. The Colonel takes note.

During the guitar solo, Elvis, confused, spins and yells to Scotty and Bill:
ELVIS
What are they hollerin’ at?
BILL
It's the...  wiggle.
ELVIS
The what?!
BILL
The wiggle!
BILL AND SCOTTY
(in unison)
Do more!
Bill slaps out a bass feature, riding Elvis’ energy as the singer throws several thrusts out towards the girls. They react in waves of squeals and screams.
Colonel descends the stairs side-stage onto the auditorium floor.
ELVIS
(sings)
Well, this is one thing, baby
That I want you to know... 
Marion, eyes locked on Elvis, as if suddenly beset by the devil, finds herself standing and screaming, too.
Colonel, now amongst the audience, clocks this reaction as he crocodiles across auditorium.
Gladys and Dixie watch, horrified.
GLADYS
Please, Lord, don't let them hurt
my baby!
VERNON
Hurt him?	Looks like they
wanna... 
He sees Dixie and coughs, embarrassed.
ELVIS
(sings)
Well, listen to me, baby
Try to understand... 
Colonel eyes every face in the audience as he makes his way side-stage.

Nell is drawn toward the stage, Tommy follows her.
TOMMY
(to Elvis)
Pucker up, buttercup.
Elvis, mic in his fist, leans in and enrages Tommy by sing-whispering a capella to sweet Nell:
ELVIS
(sings)
I'd rather be dead, little
girl... 
(eyes on Tommy)
...  than to see you with another
man.
Time stands still; a dramatic, tense pause. CUT TO Hank in the wings who, having discovered his son Jimmie, leans in and utters with revulsion:
HANK SNOW
Oh, my Lord...  What in God’s sweet
name am I looking at?
JIMMIE
Pa... 
HANK
What were you thinking, Jimmie?
JIMMIE
I guess I thought...  I don’t know
what I’m thinking.
Jimmie bites his nail. Hank, in exasperation:
HANK
Where is Colonel?
Jimmie indicates toward the Colonel, watching from the auditorium.
Elvis flicks his hair and a drop of sweat falls across Nell's cheek. It's too much -- she implodes. Nell latches on to Elvis' jacket, then another girl, and another.
ELVIS
(sings)
Come back, baby, I want to play
house with you!
Suddenly, Hank appears behind Colonel.

HANK SNOW
If we leave now we can still meet
with the Duke of Paducah... 
Colonel ignores him, frozen in disbelief at what he's witnessing. Traces of "Black Snake Moan" join the score -- the profane.
ELVIS
(sings)
Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby... 
OLD COLONEL (V.O.)
And there it was. I saw it! They
would come to call it ‘teenage
hysteria.’ Whatever it was he was
doing, it touched something within
her. The urgent, desperate need to
consume and be consumed.
Marion and Sam look to each other, witnessing a miracle.
Hank witnesses a travesty: his son Jimmie, awestruck.
Elvis sinks momentarily beneath the throng of girls, tearing at him, scratching his skin.
Nell, possessed, rips off Elvis’ jacket. Suddenly, she’s accosted from behind! Gladys grabs the jacket, screaming:
GLADYS
Why are you trying to kill my
son?!
Gladys recoils in shock, holding Elvis’ jacket. The curtain crashes closed. CLOSE on Colonel as we see the last glimmer of Elvis, rescued by Scotty, tumbling back through the blue curtains.
OLD COLONEL (V.O.)
It was the greatest carnival
attraction I’d ever seen... 
EXT. MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE - DAY
The once-crucial cotton port on the snaking Mississippi River and its triple-spanned bridge.

He was my destiny.

EXT. LAUDERDALE COURTS (MEMPHIS) - DAY
A large grass courtyard surrounded by a three-story red-brick building. Mothers gossip, kids play football and ride bikes. We catch on the radios all over:
RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
Here's a new one from Memphis'
own...  Elvis Presley!
The opening lyrics of Elvis’ latest recording “Blue Moon” can be heard, as a Crown Electric truck pulls up.
ELVIS (V.O.)
(vocal)
Blue moon,
You saw me standing alone,
Without a dream in my heart,
Without a love of my own... 
INT. CROWN ELECTRIC TRUCK - DAY
We catch a glimpse of Elvis’ eyes in the rear-view mirror. CUT TO his hand, taking up his guitar.
EXT. LAUDERDALE COURTS - DAY
As he alights from the truck, we catch Elvis in his two-tone shoes and grey Crown Electric uniform.
He makes his way down the path, through the Courts, as girls and boys look on, somewhat confused by Elvis’ sudden notoriety.
MEAN BOY
Hey squirrel, nice sideburns.
COOL GIRL
Hey Elvis.
They stare after Elvis as he crosses the courtyard and enters the building. We GLIMPSE a humble living room THROUGH a second-story window.
