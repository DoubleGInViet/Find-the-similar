Wide-eyed COUSIN BILLY (15) races for the door.
BILLY
Ok, Aunt Gladys! I’m gonna see
Elvis for a second.
Gladys is clearly anxious as she crosses to the kitchen, where Dixie is helping prepare dinner.
GLADYS
Vernon, Elvis is home.
Passing Vernon on the phone, we catch a few lines of the conversation:
VERNON
Yeah, well, Elvis done good but... 
Jimmie Rodgers Snow, he put on a
real good show.
Gladys takes a bowl of carrots from Dixie.
GLADYS
I’ll do that, Dixie, honey. What
you gonna see at the movies?
Dixie rushes to go freshen up.
DIXIE
Um, I’m not sure!
"Blue Moon" continues to play on a radio on the kitchen windowsill. It’s too much for Gladys and she snaps the radio off, anxiety palpable in her face. We CUT DOWN to the radio again but strangely, an a capella version of “Blue moon” can be heard.
ELVIS (V.O.)
(sings)
Oooohhh, oooohhh, eeee-aahhh... 
Beyond the radio, through the window, the lights in the other apartments illuminate, signaling the transition from day to night.
Neighbors lean out windows, eavesdropping.

EXT. LAUDERDALE COURTS - STAIRWELL - EVENING
Floating through the window and into the stairwell, we discover the source of the music. It’s Elvis, later that night, now joined by his girl, Dixie.
Having taken out the trash, he still holds the can in his hand as he serenades Dixie.
ELVIS
(sings)
Without a love of my own... 
Their lips almost touch. Elvis stares into Dixie’s eyes.
ELVIS
(disbelief)
Hank Snow... 
Dixie, a little disappointed, discreetly rolls her eyes.
But Elvis is lost in the thought.
ELVIS
I used to play his records every
day with Mama and now he’s
personally asked for me to be on
his tour... . I can’t believe it.
The trash can clatters to the ground. Elvis scurries down to retrieve it. Dixie, a loving roll of the eyes:
DIXIE
So, is that a yes?
ELVIS
Ahh yes?
DIXIE
Coming with me to Goldsmith's on
Sunday to pick out my prom dress.
ELVIS
Oh, sure, baby... 
Elvis, having retrieved the can, is ascending the stairs.
DIXIE
Elvis, after prom, all the couples
are going to the teen canteen.
She takes the initiative and they kiss...

ELVIS
Alright, Mama. I'm sorry, baby.
It's just so much, so quick.
DIXIE
You told your parents?
INT. PRESLEY APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY
Out the window, the GIRLS in the courtyard stare up.
GLADYS (O.S.)
So, without so much as a word to
your daddy and me... 
Gladys snaps the curtain shut.
GLADYS
You quit your job to run around in
that rickety jalopy, speeding down
dangerous roads, getting girls all
hopped up... 
Elvis is now resplendent in a top-to-toe pink suit, his immaculately quaffed bouffant of hair towering over his scowling forehead. Clearly, things have not gone well.
Vernon is sitting on the couch as Dixie finishes setting a makeshift dining table for dinner. Billy fills glasses with iced tea. GRANDMA DODGER (65) sits silently in the corner. Tension as Gladys serves up the meatloaf.
GLADYS
Soon, you'll be drinking, going
off to them slut parties--

VERNON
I knew a fella once, got his
record on the radio, and it was
all over in a flash.
ELVIS
Mr Phillips says every time I
perform onstage, it's gonna help
the record sell and we could make
some real money! I ain't gonna do
that driving a truck for Crown
Electric.
VERNON
Electrician is a good, stable job,
whereas I don't know a guitar
player worth a damn.
GLADYS
You listen to your Daddy.
At the exact moment Gladys speaks, the phone rings. Billy jumps up to answer.
BILLY
It's my mama! She's with Aunt
Cletus and all the cousins on a
shared line...  She wants to talk
to you. She heard Elvis on the
radio.
GLADYS
I can't right now!
ELVIS
Please, Mama! I'm just trying to

A pill being removed from a lacquered medication box.
Gladys gulps it down as Elvis appears in the doorway through the mirror. She's breathing heavily, tears streaming down her cheeks, black with mascara.
ELVIS

I'm going to buy you one of them
pink Cadillacs, like you saw back
when you was working at the
hospital.
Gladys breaks a little. She turns to him, embarrassed.
GLADYS
I don't need no pink Cadillac.
ELVIS
Satnin'... 
Elvis takes up Gladys' face in his hands, the tears running from her eyes.
ELVIS
I just gotta be making the most of
this thing while I can. It's like
Daddy says, this could all be over

Unconsciously takes up a lipstick.
GLADYS
I don't know how to explain it,

I saw it.
ELVIS
There's nothing to fear. They're

Applying lipstick, as if the very act comforts her.
GLADYS
No, it's more than that. It's
something I don't understand.
It's something beyond us. But I
know whatever it is, it's
something that can come between
us.
Elvis throws his arms around Gladys from behind, nuzzling her neck as if she were a giant Teddy bear.
ELVIS
No, no, no...  ain't nothing ever
going to do that. You're my girl,
my Satnin'. You'll always be my
best-est girl.

He spins the roulette wheel and looks up to see Scotty’s car driving away from Lauderdale Courts. To the iconic opening of "Mystery Train," the roulette wheel transforms into a SPINNING CHROME HUBCAP.
MONTAGE - EXT. RURAL ROAD (1955)
It's an AQUATONE BLUE SEDAN emblazoned with "Hank Snow's Jamboree Attractions Tour!" Diskin at the wheel, Colonel beside him. In an almost reckless gesture, the sedan overtakes all the cars in a convoy.
COLONEL
Let’s pull over for lunch. What is
the name of the next place?
DISKIN
The Tasty Grill.
COLONEL

The ‘Hank Snow All-Star Jamboree
Tour’ has completely sold out.
That’s right. And to celebrate I’m
buying all of you great artists
complimentary pie at the good old
Tasty Grill!
BILL
Who the hell is that?

Everyone is confused at Colonel’s sudden generosity.
COLONEL
Hank! I’m here to check your

Colonel arrives at the jukebox, perusing the singles on offer in the machine:
COLONEL
‘Let Me Go, Lover’, Hank Snow.
‘Conscience I'm Guilty’, Hank
Snow. ‘Cryin' Prayin' Waitin'
Hopin', Hank Snow.
Everyone applauds as Colonel makes his way over to Hank.
COLONEL
All hit records, all RCA! Can't

But Hank is distracted by the sight of Elvis and the boys on the other side of the cafe. He turns to Colonel.
HANK
Colonel, what is that boy doing on
our tour?!
COLONEL
I told you all about him? He comes
from a good Christian family.
HANK
I do not recall.

Colonel turns to the assembled company.

Colonel gestures in the air.
COLONEL
And I was thinking...  ‘Vernon
Presley: Business Manager!’
The room applauds. Vernon is dumbfounded by the status bestowed upon him.
ELVIS
What do you think, Daddy?
VERNON
I like it very much, son.
Colonel notices Cousin Billy, excitedly looking on.
COLONEL
You know Billy, Elvis is going to
need a lot of help on the tour... 
ELVIS
Hell, you could be my road manager
one day, Billy!
Billy beams, and all laugh. Colonel solemnly signs and offers the pen to Gladys.

COLONEL
Mrs. Presley, your son has a
unique gift. It's as if he has the
strength of two men inside of him.
Elvis clocks this unspoken moment of collusion between them. Gladys stares, pen suspended above the contract.
END FLASH FORWARD.
EXT. FERRIS WHEEL - NIGHT
Elvis looks away from the Colonel, out over the midway.
ELVIS
You know, Colonel, I'd do just
about anything to make sure my
mama and daddy never have to live
in no poverty ever again... 
FLASH FORWARD - INT. SUN STUDIOS - DAY
Gladys looks at all the beaming faces in the room. Elvis tucks Gladys’ hand inside of his.
ELVIS
Say yes, Mama. It’s gonna turn out
so nice.
Then, ever-so-slowly, Gladys puts pen to paper.

ELVIS
I wasn’t foolin’ when I told those
other kids I was gonna buy 'em a
Cadillac one day.
COLONEL
With me, my boy, we could buy them
two Cadillacs.
ELVIS
A hundred... 
COLONEL
Two hundred. A thousand... 
ELVIS
(enjoying the game)
A million...

An aeroplane?
ELVIS
A rocket ship!
(as they laugh)
Well, maybe not a rocket ship;
Mama don’t like me to fly. But me,
I’ve always wanted to fly. Fast.
Faster than the speed of light to
the Rock of Eternity... 
COLONEL
The Rock of Eternity?
ELVIS
(slowly revealing)
Captain Marvel Jr. He’s my
favorite comic book hero. He
flies.
COLONEL
What about you, Mr. Presley? Are
you ready to fly?
Elvis turns back and looks Colonel directly in the eye.
ELVIS
Yes, sir, I’m ready. Ready to fly.
FLASH FORWARD - INT. SUN STUDIOS - DAY
With a FLASH, the iconic photograph of Elvis Presley and Colonel Tom Parker's union.
END FLASH FORWARD.
EXT. FERRIS WHEEL - NIGHT
As the wheel turns, Elvis and the Colonel do, indeed, appear to be flying... 
INT. CASINO (GHOSTLY VEGAS) - NIGHT (1997)
To a "DNA" track, we APPROACH a noir-lit Elvis caged in an abstract thicket of microphones.
OLD COLONEL (V.O.)
My boy's gift was to understand
how young people felt...

The voices of gray-suited EXECUTIVES in the shadows:
EXECUTIVES (V.O.)
Morbid. Odd. We can't release
this.
ELVIS
(sings)
It’s down at the end of lonely
street at heartbreak hotel... 
We DISSOLVE THROUGH HEADLINES: "First No. 1!" “The King of Western Bop!” "First Gold Record! "
OLD COLONEL (V.O.)
It was a hit. After hit, after
hit.
EXT. GRACELAND - GATES - DAY (1956)
CLOSE ON an Elvis number plate.
OLD COLONEL (V.O.)
Together, we made a blizzard.
We see a candy-pink Cadillac swing through a wooden gate, a sunglass-ed Dodger hanging out a window. They pass grazing cattle and a sign: "SOLD! GRACELAND FARM."
MONTAGE - INT./EXT. GRACELAND - DAY
In front of a white-columned 1930s Colonial mansion, Elvis bounds from the car, beaming as he holds out the keys to Gladys. Gladys crosses the threshold in tears. Vernon hangs back in awe.
Before our eyes, the interior of Graceland transforms into all that money can buy!
As televisions and phones are being unpacked, we see Gladys, now in a different costume, standing with her newly introduced MAID.
A little flummoxed, Gladys follows the maid as she carries a brand new MIXER to the kitchen. We WHIP PAN to Gladys, now in a different costume on a different day, chasing chickens past the maid who is laying out fine china on the dining table.

Gladys herds the chickens into the front yard and through a dozen Cadillacs, finally mustering them towards Dodger.
A football suddenly smashes amidst the chickens. Irritated, Dodger hurls the football back to the horse yards where Elvis catches it and is crash-tackled by the West cousins as Jerry looks on. A noisy GO-CART driven by Billy cuts through the fray and through the Cadillacs, almost colliding with Gladys and the chickens.
WIDE SHOT: a portrait of the mayhem. CRANE DOWN through the trees to discover the rickety wooden fence is now replaced by the famous music gates, fans gathered around, opening as delivery trucks make their way through.
OLD COLONEL (V.O.)
I booked him on television, I got
him that screen test, and a seven-
picture deal with Paramount!

INT. GRACELAND - DAY
OLD COLONEL (V.O.)
But most importantly... 
We follow the boxes as they’re unloaded from the truck outside and carried into Graceland by two workmen.
OLD COLONEL (V.O.)
I created something never before
seen. One day it would become
known as... 
CAMERA moves to a box that explodes open with hundreds of ‘Loving You’ cushions with Elvis’ face on it.
COLONEL
Merchandise! Your face on every
conceivable object!
Colonel scoops the cushions up, throwing them towards Vernon, Elvis, Dodger, Gladys, and Cousin Billy.
COLONEL
Teddy Bear perfume, Elvis
lipsticks... 
Diskin takes a plaster bust from its box.
COLONEL
And plaster busts!

Colonel scoops up one of the ‘I Love Elvis’ pins.
COLONEL
Something for everyone to show
their love...  Oh look, Dodger,
what’s that behind your ear?
Colonel leans in and does a magic trick, pulling the pin from behind Dodger’s ear.
GLADYS (O.S.)
I hate Elvis?
Colonel’s face darkens. Gladys is holding one of the other ‘I Hate Elvis’ pins.
COLONEL
Yes, I hate Elvis. To my way of
thinking, ‘I Love Elvis’ is easy
to sell, but those that hate your
son will do so whether we profit
or not.
He takes the pin from Gladys and turns to Elvis.
COLONEL
After all, what is hate worth if
it's free?
Elvis takes the pin and examines it while considering the Colonel’s point. After a heavy moment, Elvis cracks a smile. He stands and pins it on his lapel.
ELVIS
The snowman strikes again... 
They all laugh. CUT AWAY to Gladys, a look of concern.
OLD COLONEL (V.O.)
But what was it people hated
exactly?
We ZOOM down on the ‘I Hate Elvis’ pin.
OLD COLONEL (V.O.)
Even in high school, Elvis was
listening to Black radio, going to
their churches, and hanging out on
Beale Street...

EXT. BEALE STREET (MEMPHIS) - DAY (1954)
The ‘hate’ badge blossoms into a flower, pinned to the lapel of a dapper African-American gent painted on a mural on the side of LANSKY BROS. clothing store. We pan off the building to reveal:
HIGH WIDE OVER the two miles of Beale Street, a thriving, densely-packed hub of Black culture.
INT./EXT. CLUB HANDY - CONTINUOUS
Through a second-story window, BIG MAMA THORNTON, a dynamic singer with a deep, rich voice, rehearses with her BAND.

We PICK UP ON the legs of Elvis as he alights in his uniform, pink socks, and two-tone shoes. He walks through the bustling crowd as we see portraits of life on Beale.
OLD COLONEL (V.O.)
Elvis wasn’t just into the music.
It was the look... 
INT./EXT. LANSKY BROS. - CONTINUOUS
Elvis stops, admiring a peacock-dapper gentlemen's store, resplendent with the styles of the Black music scene.
OLD COLONEL (V.O.)
Bernard Lansky dressed everyone
from Duke Ellington to B.B. King.
THROUGH the window, B.B. KING is fitted by LANSKY amidst bright, Lifesaver colors.

LANSKY
We’ll have everything ready for
Chicago.
B.B. KING
Well I hope Chicago is ready for
these nice threads!
LANSKY
Knock ‘em dead.
Elvis watches as B.B. jumps in his car and disappears down the street, then turns back to Mr. Lansky.
ELVIS
That was Mr. B.B. King.
LANSKY
Indeed it was. And you would be... 
eyeball buying?
Elvis’ eyes turn back to a particularly suave pink suit displayed prominently in the window.
OLD COLONEL (V.O.)
...  and pretty soon, they sought
him out, too.
MATCH CUT TO:

The same pink suit in Lansky’s window and now beside it, a photo of Elvis wearing the suit on stage.
LANSKY
Son, ever since you first came in
here, you’ve been saying you’re
gonna buy me out but I told you... 
We push past the window to where Elvis is now together with B.B. and Lansky, buying up the store. Clerks’ arms are piled with Elvis' purchases: brightly-striped shirts and jackets of every description.
LANSKY
Buy from me, don’t buy me out!

ELVIS
Well the network wants me to do a

cuttin’ it up with ‘Hound Dog’.
B.B. contemplating the enormity of it all:

Suddenly, he became a gateway to

every living room in America
