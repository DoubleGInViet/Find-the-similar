INT. SENATOR EASTLAND’S HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT
An ideal American family: MOTHER, THREE DAUGHTERS, and a SON sit around the television, watching Uncle Miltie.
Behind them, we glimpse the FATHER in his study, reading the paper, surrounded by SUITED COLLEAGUES.
INT. NBC STUDIOS (LOS ANGELES) - DAY
Elvis' performance sends a ripple of laughter out through the predominantly female audience.
MATCH CUT TO:
INT. GRACELAND - DAY

GLADYS
Even as a little one, he made me
laugh so! He's so funny!
INT. SENATOR EASTLAND’S HOUSE - STUDY - NIGHT
A newspaper headline: “Segregation Unconstitutional:
Supreme Court Strikes Down Mississippi Bus Law.”
The paper lowers to reveal the all-American father, SENATOR "BIG JIM" EASTLAND, chomping a cigar.
EASTLAND COLLEAGUE (O.S.)
And for the next leg of your
Racial Integrity tour, we've
booked the Overton Park Shell in
Memphis... 
But Eastland doesn't hear him, distracted by the sound of his children's laughter. He rises, moving towards the television.
SENATOR EASTLAND
What are they laughing about?

INT. NBC STUDIOS (LOS ANGELES) - DAY
Elvis pushes his gyration further and further. The whole experience has taken on a more raw and intense tone.
INT. SENATOR EASTLAND’S HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT
The blue light of the television dances across Eastland's disturbed face, boiling with rage.
SENATOR EASTLAND
Who the hell is that?
MRS. EASTLAND
(unsettled)
It's that boy from Memphis.
Eastland glances to his besotted daughters, barely able to conceal their desire.
EASTLAND’S DAUGHTER
Elvis Presley... 
Eastland does a double-take, catching the same look on the face of his son. A rising, volcanic revulsion as Elvis comes back to real time:
ELVIS (V.O.)

And you ain’t no friend of mine!
INT. GRACELAND - LIVING ROOM - DAY
The Presley family whoops and hollers as Berle kids around with Elvis, pretending to gyrate.
INT. SENATOR EASTLAND’S HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT
Eastland strides aggressively toward the television, face contorted in a white rage, body shaking with hate.

The obscenity and vulgarity of

white man and his children can be
driven to the level of the Negro!
We PULL BACK and Eastland is on a 1950s TV.
OLD COLONEL (V.O.)
It was putting it on the
television that caused the
problem...  It became politics.
And politics ain’t good for
business.
Another TV, and another, until the SCREEN is FILLED with 1950s TVs on which outraged critics decry:
VARIOUS CRITICS (V.O.)
Vulgarity!/Mongrel music!/Bebop is
Communism!/Ask Your Preacher about
Jungle Music!
POLITICIAN (V.O.)
The subversives who own, control,
and dominate the entertainment

We PUSH THROUGH a headline: “Public Outcry: Steve Allen under pressure to cancel Elvis.”

CAMERA GLIDES OVER the massive crowds of reporters, rubber-necking pedestrians, and Black and white teens spilling over the sidewalk outside.
As we start to hear the sweet sound of Elvis' voice singing a gospel song to a simple piano accompaniment, we GO THROUGH the stage door window...

We DISCOVER Colonel's cane and feet walking across the newspaper-strewn floor. A copy of The Memphis Press-Scimitar is dropped on the ground.
Above a photo of Elvis at the fairgrounds on “colored night,” a headline reads: “Rock ‘n’ Roll Phenomenon Cracks Memphis Segregation Laws." The CAMERA TILTS UP... 
OLD COLONEL (V.O.)
We had to change course fast.
...  and we FIND Elvis at a piano in the corner.
ELVIS

And he’ll come to you,
If you’ll ask him to.
He’s only a prayer away.
Is your heart filled with pain?
Shall I come back again?
Tell me dear, are you lonesome
tonight?
Elvis stops, sensing the Colonel's presence. He looks down at one of the headlines at his feet: "Elvis the Pelvis belongs in the Jungle!"
ELVIS
(shaking his head)
Elvis the Pelvis...  That’s one of
the most childish expressions I
ever heard coming from an adult.
Elvis looks up to see Scotty and Bill at the other end of the room, reading the papers. Everyone is on eggshells.
ELVIS
Mr. Allen gonna cancel me from the
show?
COLONEL
(somber)
Yes.
Elvis looks up, ashen. Scotty and Bill are on their feet.
They expected as much, but it still stings.
COLONEL
He's replacing you with America's
greatest singer...

sing the hound dog; it will be a
light-hearted, sophisticated
family show.
ELVIS
I can't move in one of these.
COLONEL
That's the whole point.
Colonel stops, sudden gravitas:
COLONEL (CONT’D)
Allen’s only agreed as long as
there’s no wiggling of the hips.
ELVIS
I can’t figure it out. What am I
doing wrong? My own mother
approves of what I’m doing.
Colonel points at all the papers on the ground.
COLONEL (CONT’D)
Have you seen the papers?
ELVIS
Yeah, the papers say I shot my
mother and smoke marijuana... 
COLONEL
The papers say your movement has
the style of a colored man.
Colonel picks up the copy of The Memphis Press-Scimitar, featuring Elvis breaking segregation laws.

unfortunate misstep behind us.
Colonel holds the tails up to Elvis. He looks at them.
COLONEL (CONT’D)
Now, do we want to go into
politics or stay in show business?
Elvis has no comeback.
SCOTTY
Hey Colonel, what do the light-
hearted, sophisticated, Blue Moon
Boys wear?
COLONEL
(dismissive)
We didn't discuss it.
As Colonel snaps the gap in the clothes rack shut, the CAMERA rushes through black and discovers... 
INT. STEVE ALLEN STUDIOS - STAGE - NIGHT
Steve Allen, introducing Elvis. Elvis turns to camera, now dressed in the tails. His face is a mask of horror. Staring back at him: a live BASSET HOUND in a top hat. The Blue Moon Boys look on.
An abstract nightmare of images: the dog barking; a flat audience not reacting; Steve Allen laughing.
A keening scream of humiliation.
CUT TO: Elvis rushing from the stage, pushing past Scotty and Bill who follow.
INT. STEVE ALLEN STUDIOS - REHEARSAL ROOM - LATER
Elvis bursts into the room tearing off the tails--
ELVIS
God damn it...  damn it!

embarrassing, humiliating thing I
ever did.
ELVIS
What the hell do you want me to do

Scotty, totally out of character, yells:
SCOTTY
We're musicians!
All three of them are silenced by the thought.
SCOTTY
Well, we used to be. We used to be

He turns and leaves.

Elvis’ purple El Dorado arrives at the front gates, thronged as usual with fans.
Vernon drives, Elvis beside him. Elvis is visibly shaken as he sees that some of the fans hold signs that read: “No New Elvis,” “We Want Old Elvis,” etc...

CRANE DOWN to see a sharply-dressed B.B. King leaning on the sill. He sees the El Dorado squeal to a halt across the road.
RACK DOWN THE LINE. Break, grind, switch off, key out, slam door. Elvis is out, collar up.

B.B. KING
Big Red! Yeah, I can go where I
want, play where I want, and if
they don’t like it, I can go
someplace else. It’s about

I leave all that to the Colonel.
B.B. KING
So it’s his idea, this “New
Elvis”?
Elvis nods as B.B. lights a cigarette.
B.B. KING
I don’t get it, man. Cats buy your

But before Elvis can finish, THE CROWD RUSHES THE STAGE and the sergeant’s men surround him. He drops the microphone. The boys abandon their instruments. The police throw a wall around Elvis, dragging him away, as Scotty and Bill are sucked back into the melée.
INT./EXT. PATROL CAR/RUSSWOOD PARK - NIGHT
The police sergeant and his men try to hustle Gladys into the car. She stops, seeing Elvis is not yet safe.
GLADYS
Elvis! Elvis! Get in the car!
Elvis gets thrown into a police car as Gladys is dragged by Vernon into the family car. THROUGH the rear window, Elvis glimpses their car and the vehicle with Scotty and Bill departing in different directions.
At the center of it all, the Colonel stands with the stage collapsing behind him.

Elvis drops his head back, looking up as 4th of July fireworks explode all around him. He closes his eyes.

OLD COLONEL
He didn't listen... 
Colonel UPTURNS the table!!
OLD COLONEL
HE DIDN'T LISTEN TO ME!!
A dramatic, operatic version of ‘Jailhouse Rock’ builds as we hear the BING-BING-BING of the slot machines, infused with Colonel's heavy breathing.
OLD COLONEL
The charismatic child had no idea
of the terrible price we would
both pay for his glorious tantrum.
I had to find a way out, a way to
save him.
EXT. GRACELAND - DAY (1958)
Drizzle smears the lonely Cadillacs in the driveway.
INT. GRACELAND - LIVING ROOM	- DAY
It’s gloomy and cold. Gladys sits with Vernon around the fire, Colonel nearby. Elvis on the lounge, singing.
ELVIS
(sings)
Well, I went to the bayou just
last night
There was no moon, but the stars
were bright..
Gladys holds a drink, shaking. Vernon stares blankly ahead. Elvis in shock.
GLADYS
No, there’s no way I’m letting my
baby go to Germany for two years!
VERNON
Your cousin all but lost his mind
when they sent him to Korea.

It is either the army or jail.
There’s something else, Vernon. I
vouched for your integrity, but
they've been poking in your
background.
GLADYS
He passed a bad check to put food
on the table. They were hard
times... 
ELVIS
We don’t have nothing to be
ashamed of! My daddy’s a good man.
COLONEL
But your papa did go to jail. And
if you go, too? Well, you know how
they are with their flashy
headlines. Elvis the draft-dodger,
a family of delinquents. We may
never book another date or sell
another record!
ELVIS
This is my fault.
COLONEL
My boy, don't blame yourself. I
was partially responsible.
Colonel takes an “I Hate Elvis” pin from his pocket.
COLONEL
But when I tried to warn you, you
made your own choice. Now, to my
way of thinking, the Army can be a
new beginning for us all. Let them
cut your hair, prove that you're a
clean-cut, all- American boy, a
patriot. Do your two years and
when you come back, I promise you,
I will have done everything to
make you the biggest star in
Hollywood! And you will choose
your own pictures.
ELVIS
It’s gonna be ok, Mama... 
(turning to Colonel)
Do you think they’d let me do the
movie before I ship off?

COLONEL
(reassuringly)
I could get a deferment. So you
will do the ‘King Creole’ picture
and then we’ll be off.
Colonel nods, holding up the pin.
COLONEL
But no more of this.
He throws the “I Hate Elvis” pin into the fire and the word "hate" shrivels and melts in the flames.
Gladys’ desperate sobs are drowned out by the angry growl of HAIR CLIPPERS as we--
TRANSITION TO:
INT. BARBERSHOP (FORT CHAFFEE) - DAY (1958)
Clippers cleave Elvis' rich, dark locks, sending them cascading onto the cold, cement floor.
ELVIS
Hair today, gone tomorrow.
INT. GRACELAND - NIGHT
A glass tumbler falls from Gladys’ hand. She crumples to the ground, distraught. Vernon stands, helpless.
INT. CASINO (GHOSTLY VEGAS) - NIGHT (1997)
A choir sings a dark version of “Heartbreak Hotel” as Old Colonel turns to see Gladys’ casket in the distance.
OLD COLONEL
She had fretted losing her second
son her whole life.
As he gets closer, Elvis appears, crying over his mother.
OLD COLONEL
I had to let the world know that
my boy was a good, dutiful son,
and nothing like the rebel
delinquent they feared.

INT. GRACELAND - MUSIC ROOM - DAY (1958)
The extended Presley clan gathers round the casket. Elvis wails from the back of the house.
OLD COLONEL (V.O.)
I couldn’t let a good funeral go
to waste.
Colonel sees Vernon, destroyed, sitting at the foot of the stairs. He moves towards him.
COLONEL
There are some fine folk from the
press out front...  a few words,
pictures...  then they will leave
us alone.
Vernon cuts him off, shaking his head. He nods towards a back room and the sound of Elvis’ inconsolable sobs.
VERNON
He won’t. I can't get him to do
anything. I keep asking myself,
what would she do?
COLONEL
Yes, he trusted her like nobody
else and now she’s gone and what
does he have now?
This thought cuts through to Vernon.
VERNON
He has you...  He trusts you! Talk
to him.
Colonel, as if the thought had never occurred to him:
COLONEL
It ain’t my place... 
VERNON
Can you do it? Please Colonel, we
need your help... 
Colonel nods his head, making his way down the hall.
INT. GRACELAND - GLADYS’ BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Colonel enters. Elvis, inconsolable, curled up in the closet with one of her dresses. After a moment...

ELVIS
(ever-so-softly)
All this has been for my Satnin'.
And now she can't even enjoy it.
COLONEL
(warmly)
Your poor Daddy is doing the best
he knows how but he is
overwhelmed. He just keeps asking
himself over and over again, what
she would have done? He needs your
help...  out there.
ELVIS
No, I can't go out there.	I just
want to stay here forever.
COLONEL
My boy. No one could never replace
her, but listen to me. From this
moment on, anything she would have
done, I will carry out in her
name. While you are overseas I'll
stay home and I will work and I
will worry while you serve your
time in the Army. Trust me.
The Colonel takes Elvis, guiding him gently to his feet.
COLONEL
Now come, go stand by your Papa,
comfort him, comfort your friends,
family, and even your fans.
Because if you don't, then all
your Mama sacrificed for you will
have been for nothing...  Trust me.
Elvis nods his head gently and then, unexpectedly, lays his head on the Colonel's shoulder and whispers:
ELVIS
No matter what happens, stay with
me through thick or thin, okay?
Colonel's hands move ever-so-slowly toward Elvis' shoulders, barely touching them in a strange, suspended gesture as Elvis weeps into his shoulder.
ELVIS
You're like...  you’re like...

The popping of FLASHBULBS. Elvis and Vernon sit on the steps amidst a scrum of newspapermen and photographers.

Young Mr. Presley, a rock and
roller no more...

I had done it; Elvis Presley would

of all...  love.
Colonel stands, now holding an umbrella, and looks out to the misty streets of Bad Nauheim as a car drives past.
EXT. ELVIS' HOUSE (BAD NAUHEIM) - DUSK (1959)
An unprepossessing two-story cottage. Fans cluster around the fence, craning their necks.
OLD COLONEL (V.O.)

SLOW CRANE UP OVER the front of the house, as we GLIMPSE a party through the ground floor windows.
OLD COLONEL (V.O.)
Suddenly, no one else existed but
the pretty teenage daughter of a
United States Air Force officer.
PUSH PAST leaves, THROUGH to a second-story window, where we discover a beribboned ponytail against the glass.
PRISCILLA (O.S.)
The second I walked in the door
they started bombarding me with
all these questions and I just
said ‘Excuse me if you don’t mind,
please, I’d like to go to bed.’
And then he said to me... 
The girl turns. Doll-like, with cool, turquoise eyes:
PRISCILLA BEAULIEU. She looks down on the fans below.
PRISCILLA
(imitating a man)
‘You know Priscilla, he's got
girls all over the world, okay?
Girls that are waiting outside his
house. Girls that are writing him
endless fan mail.’ And then Mommy
says to me, ‘Oh my goodness, what
could he possibly see in you? What
do you two do up there all night?’

Peculiar bric-a-brac fills Elvis' room. Bags of fan mail, piles of stuffed animals. THROUGH the open door, we see several other officers and their dates milling around.
PRISCILLA
‘We talk and listen to music,
that’s all. The fan mail and those
other girls, that's just his job.’
And then they were going on about

Memphis
