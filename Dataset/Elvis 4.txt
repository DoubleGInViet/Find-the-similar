We FOLLOW Priscilla as she gets down to join Elvis, sitting on the floor in his military uniform.
PRISCILLA
But then I said, and I said this
very calmly: ‘Listen, he’s just
lonely and quite frankly, so am
I.’ And they didn’t have anything
to say to that, so I just went to
bed.
ELVIS
I've never met anyone like you.
PRISCILLA
I hope not... 
ELVIS
You understand it all.
PRISCILLA
I don’t think I understand it all,
I think I just understand you.
(then; masking
jealousy)
What is Natalie Wood like?
ELVIS
She’s nice. She’s been writing to
me about acting. You know, I'm
making a study of Marlon Brando
and James Dean. Natalie writes
about working with him, and ‘Rebel
Without a Cause.’
PRISCILLA
‘Rebel’?
ELVIS
You’ve never seen ‘Rebel Without a
Cause’?

Hollywood to be a serious actor...

It’s really what I dream of.
A young sergeant, CHARLIE HODGE, appears at the doorway.
CHARLIE
E.P., you promised the Captain
you’d have her back by 7.
ELVIS
Hey Charlie, what’s that behind
you?
Charlie turns away as Elvis slams the door shut.
ELVIS
He don’t boss me around.
Elvis looks out the french doors, onto the street where fans are still staring up. He closes the curtains.
Priscilla, now standing by Elvis’ side, looks up to him and fills him with confidence as she says:
PRISCILLA
Well, I think if you dream it,
you’ll do it.
ELVIS
You do?
PRISCILLA

ELVIS

Jerry stops, the anger has abated. He nods his head to the TV, where James Brown and the Rolling Stones perform.
JERRY
These TV guys. They’re the ones
that put James Brown and the
Rolling Stones on the T.A.M.I

Elvis is interested, but he masks it flippantly.

JERRY
Mr. Binder, Mr. Howe, thanks for

Dean. This sign was beautiful

Elvis launches into “Jailhouse Rock.”
ELVIS
(sings)
Warden threw a party in the county
jail,
The prison band was there and they
began to wail... 
The crowd erupts into applause. Priscilla can't believe her eyes.
ELVIS
Thank you! It's been a long time,
baby! My boy, my boy!

Colonel bounds down the stairs with Diskin.
COLONEL
I do not know what is going on.
Sweating in black leather, singing
‘Hound Dog,’ what does that have
to do with Christmas?
They reach the corridor and suddenly, Scotty Moore and
D.J. Fontana cross Colonel's path. He turns to Diskin:
COLONEL
The Blue Moon Boys?! What are they
doing here?!
Colonel follows them towards the stage.

My boy, my boy.
ELVIS
OK...  Well goodnight... 
Elvis jokingly pretends to leave.
ELVIS
Uh, are we on television? Are we
on television?
CHARLIE
No, we’re on a train to Tulsa.
ELVUS
Let’s see, what do I do now folks?
SCOTTY
Why don’t you play that ‘Trying To
Get To You’ one time?
ELVIS
Twelve years he played guitar for
me man, didn’t say anything. Now
let me swap that axe with you,
champ.
With this, they exchange guitars and settle in. Elvis launches into “Trying to Get to You,” raw and intense, while staring at Priscilla.
ELVIS
(sings)
Ever since I read your letter,
Where you said you loved me true,
I’ve been traveling night and day
I’ve kept running all the way
Baby, trying to get to you.
Everyone in the control room watches on with delight. Colonel watches from the shadows, the realization dawning that they’ve all been conspiring against him. He leaves in a fury.
INT. NBC STUDIOS - CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Diskin is offering refreshments as Colonel thunders in, out of breath, barking at Binder:

Mr. Bindle?
BINDER
Absolutely... 
BONES
Right after ‘Elvis Talks.’
COLONEL
Talks? No, no, no. What does Elvis
talk about?
BINDER
About himself.
INT. NBC STUDIOS - STAGE - DAY
ELVIS
Alright, give me that piece of
paper, man. I’m gonna see what I’m
supposed to do next here.
Charlie hands Elvis the cue sheet.
ELVIS
It says here, ‘Elvis will talk
about first record... ’
CHARLIE
Little late.
ELVIS
It says here, ‘Elvis will talk
about shooting from the waist down
and not being able to touch hands
with body-- body with hands.’
(laughs)
I just got this show off the air,
boy, I tell you.
The boys laugh at the ludicrous suggestion. Elvis looks around and tosses the cue sheet aside. The audience laughs. After a moment, Elvis speaks from the heart:
ELVIS
Anyway...  I’d like to talk a
little about music...  Very little.
There’s been a big change in the
music field in the last ten or
twelve years. And uh, I like a lot
of the new groups, the Beatles and
the Beards, and the whoever...

ELVIS (CONT'D)
But a lot of it is basically, our
music is basically...  rock ’n’
roll music is basically, uh... 
Gospel or rhythm and blues.
People have been adding to it,
adding instruments to it,
experimenting with it. But it uh,
it all boils down to just uh...  I
don’t know what I’m talking about
really, I’m just mumbling, man.
SCOTTY
Hey, Elvis, why don't you talk
about, uh...  little finger?
They share a look-- connecting.
ELVIS
The little finger. Yeah that’s all
I could move at Russwood.
Elvis thinks back... 
ELVIS
The uh, the police filmed the show
on the 4th of July in Memphis
because the PTA or the YMCA or
somebody, they thought I was uh... 
something.
As the audience chuckles, Elvis' eyes flick up to Colonel in the control room.
ELVIS
So uh, the police came out to film
the show. So they told me I
couldn’t move, I had to stand
still. The only thing I could move
was my little finger like that,
man.
(wiggles finger)
You ain’t nothin’ but a hound dog
Crying all the time... 
If you’re looking for trouble, you
came to the right place... 
The band and audience crack up as the soulful strains of "Sometimes I Feel Like a Motherless Child," sung by Darlene Love begins... 
ELVIS
But, uh, that’s one thing about
this TV special that I’m doing.
They’re gonna let me do what I
wanna do...
