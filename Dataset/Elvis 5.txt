NBC FLOOR MANAGER
Steve, we gotta get back to work.
Binder stands:
BINDER
Listen...  I just want to say that
I’m looking at all of us... 
(re:	himself)
Jewish director, black
choreographer, Puerto Rican
choreographer, dance sections of
black, white and you know, purple.
And of course... 
(to Elvis)
Our gentleman from Tupelo...  And
to me, this is the kind of nation
we are. Right here. In this room.
And we cannot end this show with
‘Here Comes Santa Claus.’ We have
to say something. You have to make
a statement, E.P.

COLONEL (O.S.)
Mr. Presley does not make
statements.
The curtain that hides Elvis’ bedroom is slowly drawn back. It’s the Colonel. He walks in and stares the entire room down.
COLONEL
He sings ‘Here Comes Santa Claus’,
and wishes everyone ‘Merry
Christmas’ and ‘Goodnight.’
Colonel's jabs at the dial; the screen goes black.
COLONEL
The show must go on.
The West cousins and the Floor Manager move everyone out of the room. Elvis says nothing. Faces fall, disgusted by the cowardice of the King.
INT. NBC STUDIOS - CONTROL ROOM
It’s late and Bones is making coffee for himself and Binder as they watch coverage of the Robert Kennedy shooting on the monitors. PUSH IN ON: a monitor.
INT. NBC - DRESSING ROOM - LATER
MATCH SHOT: pull out on a miniature TV in Elvis’ dressing room. Billy helps Elvis into his robe.
COLONEL
Poor Mrs. Kennedy. A tragedy, a
tragedy...  But it has nothing to
do with us.
Suddenly, Elvis bursts through the curtains.
ELVIS
It has everything to do with us... 
COLONEL
I just do not think we should be
making speeches about politics and
religion.
ELVIS
Dr. King was shot eight miles from
Graceland, while I was out here
singing to turtles. And now this,
and all you can think about is how
many goddamn sweaters I can sell?!

This wounds Colonel's pride.
COLONEL
I'm a promoter, that’s what I do.
But Elvis does not back down... 
ELVIS
Well I’m Elvis Presley. That’s
what I do.
The Colonel's eye takes on that crocodile gleam.
COLONEL
Well, Mr. Bindle has really gotten
inside your head with all of his
hippy friends. You actually think
that singing your old songs
dressed in black leather,
sweating, mumbling incoherently to
the audience, was a good show?
ELVIS
Colonel, I know when I’ve excited
an audience.
The Colonel rounds on him.
COLONEL
That was not a real audience my
boy.	There was a sign flashing
‘applaud’ telling them when to
clap for you.
This touches Elvis' Achilles heel. The Colonel knows he's landed a blow and drives in, brandishing his cane.
COLONEL
This entire jamboree is an
embarrassment!
(thud goes the cane)
You have embarrassed the
sponsors... 
(off thud)
You have embarrassed yourself... 
(off thud)
And you have embarrassed me... 
(off thud)
Now, you can sing whatever songs
you and Mr. Bindle choose for 55
minutes, but at the end of the
show there will be a Christmas
song.

Or we will be sued-- no, you will
be sued for breach of contract,
because I will no longer be the
promoter your career...  I will
have to leave you.
Elvis takes this in. Colonel makes his way to the door.
COLONEL
I have convinced our friends at
Singer to come back tomorrow for
‘Here Comes Santa Claus.’ I’ll see
you in the morning, Mr.
Presley.
(turning before he
exits)
Oh, and as I recall, Dr. King said
rock and roll contributed to
juvenile delinquency.
Elvis turns back to the television. PUSH IN ON: L.B.J. on the television and MATCH CUT TO:
INT. NBC STUDIOS - CONTROL ROOM/STAGE - NIGHT
L.B.J. on the monitor in the control room. Binder turns off the three monitors with a ‘click, click, click.’ Bones behind him. He notices Elvis down in the studio.
CUT TO: the abandoned studio floor. A stark work light slashes the Santa set, where Elvis stands in deep contemplation. He sings a couple of melancholic lines from "Here Comes Santa Claus.”
BINDER (V.O.)
(intercom)
We're set for the number tomorrow
right E.P?
Elvis looks up to Binder in the control room.
BINDER
It's pretty familiar territory... 
Is it okay if we just run through
it in the morning?
He looks to Bones, pulling on his jacket to leave, weary with disappointment. Elvis stares back at Binder and Bones, defiance in his eyes... 
ELVIS
A reverend told me once: ‘When
things are too dangerous to say... 
sing.’

INT. NBC STUDIOS - CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Binder ponders. He turns to Bones, who has stopped putting on his jacket. Binder looks down at the script he was about to throw out. We hear simple piano chords.
CLOSE ON Binder’s script as we match cut to... 
INT. NBC STUDIOS - DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT
TOP SHOT: Elvis, lying on the floor, holding Binder’s script. He moves the paper to reveal the lyrics to ‘If I Can Dream’ on the flip-side. Binder, Bones and BILLY GOLDENBERG are around the piano, shaping up a song.
ELVIS
(sings)
There must be lights burning
brighter somewhere
Got to be birds flying higher in a
sky more blue... 
Time passes and the piano chords transform into a warm, stirring brass section.
INT. NBC STUDIOS - CONTROL ROOM - DAY
We once again see Colonel barreling along past the window at the back of the room, wearing a Christmas sweater. Diskin, also in sweater, and Charlie Hodge in tow.
CHARLIE
They were in there all night... 
COLONEL
Doing what?
CHARLIE
Working on the new song. He says
he’s singing it... 
COLONEL
New song? No.
Colonel enters the control room.
COLONEL
Oh, it's beginning to look a lot

Colonel turns to the Singer Executives, but before he can speak, we hear the stirring brass, and the Singer Executives' faces turn ashen.
BINDER
Bring up the lights on the sign.
INT. NBC STUDIOS - STAGE - CONTINUOUS ACTION
The West cousins pull back a curtain to reveal a white-suited Elvis. Priscilla kisses him before he takes the stage.
PRISCILLA
Good luck, baby.
Suddenly, the TV cameras turn away from the Santa set and towards the giant “ELVIS” letters illuminated in red.
INT. NBC STUDIOS - CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION
The Colonel moves in disbelief to the window as a crane with a CAMERAMAN sweeps in front of his reddening face.
INT. NBC STUDIOS - STAGE - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Elvis, now fully revealed in the spotlight, sings as if speaking to the whole world from the depths of his soul.
ELVIS

We're lost in a cloud!
With too much rain!
The cast looks on, moved by the power of the message and the voice.
ELVIS

We're trapped in a world!

INT. NBC STUDIOS - CONTROL ROOM - DAY
Colonel’s face is like thunder. Diskin, inscrutable, yet an undeniable inner approval.
Just then, Priscilla walks in. She shares a look with Binder and stands by him.
ELVIS (V.O.)
Deep in my heart there's a
tremblin' question
Still I am sure that the answer,
answer's gonna come somehow
Out there in the dark, there's a
beckoning candle
And while I can think, while I can

INT. CASINO (GHOSTLY VEGAS) - NIGHT (1997)
ELVIS (V.O.)
While I can stand, while I can

Colonel, now walking away from the Elvis set, back into the ghostly casino whence he came.
OLD COLONEL
I was certain it was going to be a
disaster.
We STAY ON Colonel’s face as it transforms.
OLD COLONEL
(a tepid whisper)
But I was wrong.
Never before have we seen the Colonel so vulnerable.
EXT. GRACELAND - DAY (1969)
A lively picnic to the sounds of Elvis’ ‘Memphis Tennessee.’ Elvis and Priscilla race around on a golf cart. A new era at Graceland.

INT. GRACELAND - MUSIC ROOM - AFTERNOON (1969)
Graceland, completely reimagined in a hip, sixties look, with an equally hip cocktail party in swing. Elvis, Priscilla, Jerry ,and a cool, rangy character, TOM HULETT, look over the plans for a touring plane.
JERRY
Air Presley’s new wings.
ELVIS
(sings)
I’ll fly away, oh glory
I’ll fly away, in my Convair 880.
HULETT
With a state room in the back,
extra seating in the front.
PRISCILLA
You mean we can sleep on the
plane?
HULETT
That’s the whole point! When you
play stadiums, it’s like a week of
shows in just one night. So when
it’s done, you hop on the plane
and go where you want... 
ELVIS
“Go where you want, play where you
want, and if they don’t like it,
go some place else.” B.B. King
told me that.
HULETT
B.B.	knows, man...  I’ve been doing some research. Last year alone, you turned down two offers in Germany and Japan for a million bucks...  for one night! You know who gets offers like that?
Elvis shrugs.

HULETT
Nobody...  Nobody except Elvis.
Aaron. Presley. Just last week,
with our newest group, Led
Zeppelin, they sold out the
Coliseum in Vancouver. Just
imagine what you could do. Why the
Colonel turned them down is beyond
me.
JERRY
Well if you figure it out, let us
know.
A tense moment. Elvis spies little LISA MARIE and picks her up.
PRISCILLA
We should call it the “Lisa
Marie.” Are you guys hungry? Let’s
eat.
Joining Vernon, his new wife, DEE, Charlie, Lamar and girlfriends, they hold court like the Kennedys.
They all sit down for dinner. A phone RINGS. Charlie pops out, and back in.
CHARLIE
Hey EP, it’s the Colonel.
ELVIS
Not now, Charlie. I’m sitting down
to dinner with my family.
CHARLIE
(into the phone)
You’re gonna have to call back
later.
ELVIS
(to the table)
I want you to get me some songs. I
want you to get me some songs,
too. I want every one of you, if
you know somebody, to get me some
songs.
LAMAR
Hey, I got something from a young
guy, Eddie Rabbitt: "Kentucky
Rain" You’ve got to do it. It’s
just that good.

INT. GRACELAND DINING ROOM - LATER
PAN off the chandelier to find STAFF clearing away the last of the plates at the meal’s end. It’s a warm atmosphere and spirits are high. Elvis’ end of the table is abuzz with talk of the new album:
JERRY
You know E, I love the new song,
man it’s--
ELVIS
(interrupting)
It’s unlike anything I’ve ever
sung before.
PRISCILLA
The first time Elvis played it for
me, I cried.
CHARLIE
I don’t know about the title: “In
The Ghetto”... 
DEE
“In The Ghetto?”	That’s going to
put a lot of people off.
CHARLIE
Well it’s a great song but, you
know, it might... 
JERRY
Have you settled on a name for the
album?
ELVIS
From Elvis...  in Memphis. Going
back to my roots recording here in
my home town. And then we take it
to the world with our new wings.
Priscilla summons the maid who brings a tray of jewelry boxes with a tag reading: “From Elvis.” She hands them out around the table.
PRISCILLA
And in honor of that, Elvis and I
have organized a little surprise.
It’s nothing crazy.
ELVIS
To celebrate this new chapter, the
new album, and the tour.

Vernon, now a few drinks past his limit, attempts an aside to Dee.
VERNON
And if the tour doesn’t go off as
planned, those costs, the
musicians, that airplane, that’s
gonna be on my head, yeah.
A tense silence, as if Colonel’s presence is suddenly felt.
HULETT
Mr Presley, with all due respect,
man, there’s no way this tour
won’t bring in mucho dinero.
VERNON
Well son, I’m sorry, but it’s my
job to worry about these finances
because I am business manager.
PRISCILLA
Vernon, we’re all taking care of
business now.
Hulett opens one of the boxes, holding up a lightning bolt necklace, emblazoned with “TCB”.
ELVIS
That’s right. We’re gonna TCB
around the world...  but that don’t
mean nothin’ without a little
tender loving care at home.
One of the women at the table opens her box to find a matching “TLC” necklace inside.
PRISCILLA
You can’t have one without the
other.
ELVIS
To TCB and TLC.
Glasses are raised as the guests respond, some trying on their new necklaces with a laugh. Vernon looks on incredulously.
VERNON

And how much did these cost?
Priscilla looks to Elvis, catching a flicker of self-doubt.

ELVIS

Well, the world turns
And a hungry little boy with a

Face down on the street with a gun
in his hand

MEYER KOHN
You’ve run up quite a tab,

The moment you get near him, he’ll
have you under 10 feet of snow

Elvis looks to her, knows where she’s going.
ELVIS
Baby my mind’s made up.	Business
is business, but I owe it to him
to tell him to his face.

Just be careful he doesn’t clip

Elvis slides into the bed, cuddling her.

He won’t. I’m gonna go see him in
Vegas, look him in he eyes and
tell him it’s over.
PRISCILLA
I actually feel sorry for him.
ELVIS
Me too.
We can tell by the way Elvis gently nods that his feelings for the Colonel still run deep. Priscilla clicks off the TV remote and we go to black.

Colonel’s eyes bulge, a dismissive smile as he intones...

Stop making such a fuss. Diskin,

my back out.	It was just all the
excitement over your Christmas
special; but I shouldn't have
worried any.
He stops and looks Elvis directly in the eye.
COLONEL
You came through as you always do.
I may have very small ideas, but
no one can sell a show to an
audience like you can. I admit it,
I was wrong.
It's almost as if there's an invisible tear in Colonel's eye. Elvis strengthens his resolve.
ELVIS
Colonel, I want to tell you in
person. As far as business is
concerned, I think we need to go
our separate ways.
But Colonel is all enthusiasm.

what’s that one Diskin? “Boukin?”
DISKIN
The Budokan in Tokyo.
COLONEL
The Budokan in Tokyo...  But
creating a show worthy of an
international tour is very, very
expensive. All those costs eat
into the artist’s profits and I
worry that the financial risk
would put a strain on your father.
I’ve been thinking, as your former
technical advisor and as an old
friend... 
The Colonel looks to Elvis, looking for reassurance.
COLONEL
What if your show didn’t cost a
single cent? Then it would be all
profit! Every dollar you make
would be a dollar profit! And I
think your daddy would like the
sound of that very much.
Colonel touches a button and the drapes rush back to REVEAL: the International Hotel, vaulting skywards!
INT. INTERNATIONAL HOTEL - SHOWROOM - LATER
A late-‘60s red-and-white extravaganza. Colonel at one end of the auditorium. Nurse Tish by his wheelchair. Elvis examines the cavernous stage.

Elvis considers. He knows there's a truth here.

Now yours and Mr Hulett’s

nothing less than great. Nothing
less than Elvis Presley.

You can fill this stage with every

It would cost.
Colonel leans into Elvis. There's an intimacy in their closeness in this vast space:
COLONEL
Yes! That’s the beauty of it.
This here International Hotel
needs a mighty big draw card to

You know, the first thing I ever

was “That’s All Right Lil Mama”

Just when we think the hound dogs can’t get any bigger... 
Colonel stands in front of: “WORLD’S BIGGEST HOUND DOG!”
INT. INTERNATIONAL HOTEL - SHOWROOM - DAY
Rehearsal reaches new, dizzying peaks.
ELVIS
Bones, give me something strong on
the one.
Trombones join. Elvis walks over to RONNIE TUTT.
ELVIS
Alright, take it home, brother. Do
it to me. Come on.
Drums go wild. Elvis wiggles in rhythm, as Ron Tutt's thunderous drum solo from outer space begins...

The drum solo, LOUDER and LOUDER.	MASSIVE BRASS CHORDS.
Elvis and his entourage walk around the back of the stage, he tunes his guitar. Elvis takes a moment, summoning all his strength.
INT. INTERNATIONAL HOTEL - SHOWROOM - NIGHT
To deafening applause, the ornate showroom explodes into a million flashbulbs as Elvis takes the stage and launches into a super-fast up-tempo vocal:
ELVIS
(sings)
Well, that's all right, mama,
That's alright for you,
That's alright, mama, any way you
do... 
In one booth, Colonel sits with stoic Goochera and Meyer Kohn. In another, Priscilla, next to a proud Vernon and Dee.
INT. JUKE JOINT - NIGHT (1947)
The juke joint’s on fire to Arthur Crudup, leaving no doubt as to the influence on Elvis on stage.
BIG BOY CRUDUP

Well, my mama, she done told me,
Papa told me, too,
‘This life you're living, son, now
women be the death of you,’ now

Young Elvis mouths the words.

OLD COLONEL (V.O.)
He put everything he knew about
music into that show.
Elvis banters with the audience between numbers.
COLONEL
Ain’t nobody gonna do a better
show than that! If I was you, I’d
book him for the next hundred
years!
KOHN
Well, no better time than the
present.
GOOCHERA
We’d like to make him part of the
family, Colonel.
There is something chilling beneath Goochera’s bonhomie.
COLONEL
Well, I think Mr. Presley could be
persuaded to make the
International his home... 
Suddenly, Elvis calls for a spotlight on Colonel. Colonel waves to the audience, and with the spotlight still on him, he says out of the side of his mouth:
COLONEL
Providing of course, he was paid
pretty well.
KOHN
What did you have in mind?
Colonel takes out his pen with a flourish as Elvis moves into "Suspicious Minds."
ELVIS
(sings)
We're caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much, baby
Why can't you see
What you're doing to me
When you don't believe a word I
say?
COLONEL
Well, for an attraction as
tremendous as Mr Presley...

As we INTERCUT with Elvis’ intensifying physical routine,
Colonel scrawls directly onto the tablecloth: "ELVIS
PRESLEY, $500,000 PER ENGAGEMENT FOR FIVE YEARS... 
OLD COLONEL (V.O.)
I couldn’t let him leave. I had to
keep him home, keep him safe.
ELVIS
(sings)
We can't go on together
With suspicious minds
And we can't build our dreams
On suspicious minds... 
... 1969 - 1970 - 1971 - 1972 - 1973 = $5,000,000 PLUS $100,000 SIGNING BONUS.”
COLONEL
That’s what my boy would expect.
Colonel presents the pen to Kohn who considers, signs the tablecloth, and hands the pen back.
COLONEL
Now what are you going to pay me?
KOHN
If there’s one thing I’ve learned,
it’s never bet against the
Colonel. Your sideshow is the
jackpot.
Kohn can’t help admire the Colonel’s unfailing chutzpah as he scribbles on a COCKTAIL NAPKIN, shows it to Goochera, who nods, and then slides it over to Colonel... 
It reads, "THE UNDERSIGNED, COLONEL TOM PARKER, IS A 'SPECIAL GUEST' OF THE INTERNATIONAL HOTEL. HE HAS UNLIMITED CREDIT AT ALL TABLES."
Colonel signs the napkin and snatches it up, before easing himself out of the booth.
COLONEL
Oh, and of course I’ll reserve the
right to sell calendars, pictures
and such on the side.
Kohn rolls his eyes, and nods.
Colonel crocodiles through the audience, eyes locked on Elvis' incredible performance. Entering the wings, he sees Jerry between vaulting curtains, staring at the apparition of Elvis. Colonel places a hand on Jerry's shoulder and he turns around.

JERRY
Elvis really wants to announce
tonight.
The Colonel peers at Jerry and raises a finger.
COLONEL
An announcement?
JERRY
The tour, at the press conference.
He’s gonna set E.P. up with his
own plane.
COLONEL
Or perhaps a rocket ship?
Jerry half-laughs at Colonel’s strange joke. Without taking his eyes off Elvis, Colonel leans in:
COLONEL
Just one thing. Keep in mind... 
security. Security.
JERRY
Hulett knows what he’s doing.
Colonel fades back to join Diskin at the legs of the proscenium, the red floor lights flickering on them both.
ELVIS
(sings)
We're caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much, baby
Colonel halts abruptly, cane before his eyes, staring inward. Suddenly, intense:
COLONEL
Diskin, have we discussed with Mr.
Hulett? Pertaining to the death
threats?
DISKIN
(unsure)
Death threats?
Colonel unconsciously taps his cane, deep in thought.
COLONEL
(mouthing the words)
Death threats...

A door cracks ajar to reveal a Showroom menu on the floor outside. The photo of Elvis’ face is scratched out. Scrawled across it: “I am going to kill you.”
END FLASH FORWARD.
INT. INTERNATIONAL HOTEL - SHOWROOM - NIGHT
Back in the present, Elvis has the audience spellbound, as he repeats the final verse over and over... 
ELVIS
(sings)
We're caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much, baby
A tap from the Colonel’s cane sends us into a stylized, operatic bubble of Suspicious Minds.
FLASH FORWARD INT. INTERNATIONAL HOTEL - SHOWROOM - NIGHT
Elvis, in a different jumpsuit, is performing ‘Never Been to Spain.’ FOUR MEN charge the stage, sending Elvis to one knee, reaching for a holster in his boot. The Memphis Mafia rush to stop him, dragging him from the stage.
The crowd applauds, thinking it is part of the show, until Elvis returns.
ELVIS
I’m sorry ladies and gentleman.
I’m sorry I didn’t break his
goddam neck! If he wants to shake
my hand I’m fine, if he wants to
get tough I’ll whoop his ass... 
Elvis charges into ‘Polk Salad Annie.’
END FLASH FORWARD.
INT. INTERNATIONAL HOTEL - SHOWROOM - NIGHT
The audience cheers Elvis, as Suspicious Minds reaches its thundering climax. As the stage lights drop to black, the reaction is rapturous.
OLD COLONEL (V.O.)
That night he went from a man, to
a god...

From his vantage point by the stage, Colonel looks over to Priscilla, sat with Vernon and his new wife, Dee.
OLD COLONEL (V.O.)
She had never seen him perform
live, and in her face I saw a
familiar expression. The same fear
I had seen in the face of his
mother. The realization that he no
longer belonged to her... 
Dee turns to Pricilla, almost yelling amidst the fervor.
DEE
You must see this all the time!
But a clearly astonished Priscilla is slow to respond, a thought dawning on her.
PRISCILLA
Never... 
DEE
Never what?
PRISCILLA
I've never seen him perform a live
show before.
DEE
You're the lucky one, you get to
take him home!
INT. INTERNATIONAL HOTEL - SHOWROOM - NIGHT
OLD COLONEL  (V.O.)
Yes, he was once again Elvis,
making love to a live audience.
More cheers.
ELVIS

Wise men say, only fools rush
in... 
But I can't help falling in love
with you... 
Shall I stay?
Would it be a sin... 
If I can't help falling in love
with you?

The Colonel has moved back into the auditorium. Leaning down from the stage to kiss a woman in the audience, Elvis looks up and connects with Colonel. They share a smile; once again great together.
Elvis unexpectedly walks down into the audience, as if offering himself as sacrifice. Colonel directs security to throw an instant ring around Elvis.
OLD COLONEL (V.O.)
That’s what was great about Elvis.
He’d get an idea and take it to
the rock of eternity... 
Placing his hands on Elvis’ waist, the Colonel guides Elvis through the melée and an orgy of kisses.
Colonel shares a look with Priscilla.
OLD COLONEL (V.O.)
In this, his greatest moment, she
could see the nature of his love.
A love that we mere mortals could
only glimpse from the shadows.
Gifting Elvis back to his audience, Colonel saunters back through the showroom in a victory lap.
ELVIS
(sings)
For I can't help falling in love
with you... 
The enormous golden curtain falls. The crowd rises in unrestrained adoration, while Jerry guides Priscilla, Vernon, and Dee backstage.
JERRY
He did it! Next stop: the world!
Priscilla manages an insecure smile.
