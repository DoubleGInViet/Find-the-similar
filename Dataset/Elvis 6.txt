INT. INTERNATIONAL HOTEL - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT
Behind the curtain, the Memphis Mafia gather around and swathe Elvis in towels, moving him towards Jerry, Priscilla, Vernon, and Dee. The Colonel looks on from the shadows on the other side of the stage. Priscilla unabashedly throws her arms around Elvis.
PRISCILLA
I don't know who that was out
there, but I sure am glad I'm
married to him.

VERNON
Son, Mama was looking down on you,

DEE
Oh, you were wonderful! Do you
mind signing these for my boys?
But Elvis is staring towards the Colonel, isolated, alone. Priscilla, sensitive to this:
PRISCILLA
Mr Presley...  I see that’s your
new manager over there.
With this, she and Jerry guide Vernon and Dee away.
PRISCILLA
We’ll see you at the party.
But Elvis has already begun to cross the stage.
COLONEL
Tremendous triumph, greatest show
on earth! My dear boy, this
brainchild came from you and me.
But you above it all made it work
with your talent and dedication.
We did it, my boy.	We did it.
ELVIS
We did it. I can’t wait to show
the world what you and I can do.
Colonel's eyes drift towards the napkin gripped in his hand. Like Judas clutching 30 pieces of silver... 
COLONEL
Yes, the world will see your show.
I guarantee it. Whatever I have to
do I will carry it out...  Whatever
it takes.
OLD COLONEL (V.O.)

I plead innocent of all charges!
Laughter from the reporters. Elvis sits down.
REPORTER
We love you Elvis!
ELVIS
Thank you dear, I love you too.
Thank you.
REPORTER
Mr Presley, why do you think
you've outlasted every other
entertainer from the fifties and
for that matter the sixties as
well?
ELVIS
I take vitamin E. Uh no, no I was
only kidding. I don’t know. I just
embarrassed myself, man. Uh I
don't know dear. I just enjoy the
business. I like what I'm doing
REPORTER
Are you satisfied with the image
you've established?
ELVIS
Well, the image is one thing and
the human being is another, you

Elvis, what finally made you come
out of seclusion and decide to
make personal appearances again?
ELVIS
I just missed it. I missed the
closeness of an audience, of a
live audience. So just as soon as
I got out of the movie contracts,
I started to do live performances
again.
REPORTER
Will you be continuing to do more
live work in the future?
ELVIS
I think so. There's so many places
I haven't been yet. I'd like to go
to Europe, I'd like to go to Japan
and all those places. I've never
been out of the country except in
the service, you know.
LORD SUTCH

Hotel staff unload boxes of merchandise onto the table, as Colonel points to the brick-a-brack displayed throughout his vast new offices. He turns to Jerry:
COLONEL
I snowed them, I snowed these
hotel people! Not just for the
office but the entire floor for
Jamboree Attractions. We’re

JERRY

But I thought we were going on
tour in two weeks... 
Colonel’s face suddenly darkens, as a rage unlike any other comes upon him. He spits with terrifying vitriol:
COLONEL
Oh, the tour...  have you thought
about security? Have you thought
about security? Security, Jerry!
SECURITY, SECURITY. There is
nothing more important than
security! Am I the only one who
ever thinks about Elvis’ security!
‘GODVERDOMME’
Furious, Colonel hurls his cane.

ELVIS
What was that?
Fearful paranoia overtakes Elvis’ face. Diane starts to pull on her clothes.
ELVIS

I don’t want no sonofabitch
walking around saying he killed
Elvis Presley... 
DIANE

Nothing, baby... 
Elvis checks behind the door and finds nothing there. He regains his fragile composure.
ELVIS
C’mon baby, take your pants off.
DIANE
I have to go to work.
ELVIS
No you don’t, come sit down. Come
watch some television with me.
Diane starts to leave. Elvis’ words begin to slur as the pills take effect.

Elvis looks to Diane.
ELVIS
Hey, you want to fly away with me?
DIANE
I need to go.
ELVIS
Please stay.
But Diane grabs her shoes and exits. Elvis looks around the room, scared. There's a KNOCK on his door.
ELVIS
I knew you'd come back.
No answer. He takes his gun, walks over to the door, peers through the hole. An empty hall. He opens the door. There's a showroom menu on the ground.
The photo of his face has been scratched out. Scrawled across it: “I am going to kill you.”

Elvis lies in the bed. Priscilla, Vernon, and Charlie around him.
ELVIS
What are you talking about
Colonel? I ain’t gonna let any

He takes a handful of pills from Dr. Nick.
COLONEL
Precisely, you’re not one of
Hulett’s long-hair Zeppelins,
you’re Elvis Presley! And you are

C’mon, Tom, we all owe E.P. for

Jerry takes out the letter and, as he begins to read, we hear the sound of a young man speaking in lightly accented English:
THEO JR. (V.O.)
Dearest Uncle Andreas, I hope this
letter finds you well. I did not
have an exact address, but after
reading the letter you sent to my
father, I felt that I must ask you
some questions. You write of
mistakes, ‘that someone may have
made without meaning to do so.’
Are these ‘mistakes’ the reason
you left Holland all those years
ago?
INT. CASINO (GHOSTLY VEGAS) - NIGHT (1997)
As we continue to hear the letter, Colonel walks into the life-sized model of BREDA, as if reliving the past.
THEO JR. (V.O.)
People whisper that it was because
of the woman who was murdered the
night you disappeared. I do not
believe it, but please, why do you
not return home to clear our
family name... ?
OLD COLONEL
(directly to us)
Is it fair that the mistake that
someone might have made without
meaning to do so, should damn them
for the rest of their lives? Yes,
I was born in Holland. People say
‘well why didn’t you say so?’ Well
I say they didn’t ask. I work, I
wake up at five A.M. every day for
one man only. I am taking care of

out on his own, that’s alright by
me, but Presley Enterprises must
cough up what it owes...  Are you

INT. INTERNATIONAL HOTEL - ELVIS’ ROOM - DAY
A clean, morning sunlight slashes across the Nevada desert and into Elvis’ suite. Drop cloths over furniture, gold records removed from the wall. We follow luggage on a gold bellman’s trolley being pushed by Cousin Billy. He gives a final look over their home of the past few years.
BILLY
E.P. says we need to hurry up.
CHARLIE
I know. You got the coats, that’s
all tour, and everything on this
side is going to Graceland.

As Billy exits, the door opens to reveal the ashen face of Vernon. He enters past Charlie without acknowledgment, and sets down a letter onto the piano.
VERNON
Where’s Elvis?
CHARLIE
Oh, Vernon...  He’s downstairs.
VERNON
Tell him I need to talk to him.
Vernon pours himself a drink and stares out blankly over the desert vista.
INT. INTERNATIONAL HOTEL - PARKING GARAGE - DAY
An endless stream of luggage is ferried into limousines in the parking garage. FOLLOW the luggage to find... 
INT. ELVIS’ LIMO - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Elvis in the back of his limo, a little jittery from withdrawal. But if anything, this energizes him, making him even more determined to leave, no matter what.
ELVIS
What’s the hold-up?
Charlie enters the garage, leans into Elvis’ window.
CHARLIE
Sorry, E.P. Your daddy won’t come
down, says he needs to talk... 
Elvis exits the car and heads back toward the hotel
JERRY
You alright?
Elvis waves him back. OFF Elvis’ concerned expression... 
INT. INTERNATIONAL HOTEL - ELVIS’ ROOM - DAY
Elvis enters the suite and Vernon gestures toward the letter on the piano. ANGLE ON A “PRESLEY ENTERPRISES” BALANCE SHEET WITH A BIG TOTAL CIRCLED IN RED: “$9,800,099.”
ELVIS
Daddy...  What is this?

Vernon stands there looking like a dead man.
VERNON
Son, we owe Colonel. We’re
broke... 
ELVIS
I been playing this mausoleum for
a hundred years! How could we be
broke?
Vernon is shaking his head, eyes filled with tears.
VERNON
You spend so much. The cars, the
clothes, the girls, the new
airplane, everything.
ELVIS
Daddy, you’re my business manager,
you’re supposed to be taking care
of business!
VERNON
I don’t know what to tell you,
son. We’re broke, just plain
broke... 
His eyes raise to meet Elvis.
VERNON
We gotta take Colonel back.
ELVIS
I’m not taking him back.
VERNON
We’ll lose Graceland.
ELVIS
He has taken fifty percent of
everything I make. And now he
wants to take the house that we
bought for Mama? The old bastard
can sue if he wants, but I’m
flying away, with or without you,
Daddy... 
Elvis storms out of the suite... 
INT. INTERNATIONAL HOTEL - ELEVATOR - DAY
The elevator descends. Elvis -- a powder keg of emotions.
He takes deep breaths, reining himself in.

INT. INTERNATIONAL - PARKING GARAGE - DAY
Colonel waiting in the empty concierge area. Beyond the glass, Elvis can see the waiting cars.
A beat. Is this a set-up? He steps out of the elevator.
ELVIS
You blood-sucking old vampire; you
bled me dry, but still you want
more.
COLONEL
I’m not an uncaring man, Mr.
Presley.
ELVIS
Don’t you ‘Mr. Presley’ me, you
toad.
COLONEL
If you are so determined to get
out of our contract... 
ELVIS
Goddamn right I want out!
COLONEL
Then I will personally loan you
the money you owe to Jamboree
Attractions.
ELVIS
Yeah, and you’ll still have your
claws in me. Still have me workin’
here like a slave in a salt mine,
you phony, no-good piece of trash.
Who are you, Colonel from outta
space?
COLONEL
Colonel from outta space, and
Captain Marvel Jr. Has a nice ring
to it, don’t you think?

goddamn face...

Remember, you were so ready to fly

straight to the Rock Of Eternity.’
ELVIS
(intense)
Who are you?
COLONEL
I, am you. And you, are me.
ELVIS
Cut the horseshit... 
COLONEL
Everyone else you’re associated
with lives from you. Even
Vernon... 
Elvis, shocked. The realization dawning.
COLONEL
That’s right, even your own daddy
looks after himself, before he
looks after you. Yes, I lived from
you, too. But the difference is
that you also lived from me. Since
that first night on that big,
beautiful wheel, lookin up into
the moon and the stars, we
understood that we are the same,
you and I: we are two odd, lonely
children, reaching for Eternity.
And to my way of thinking, we
traveled beyond our wildest
dreams. Perhaps you should find
another manager to replace me.
But what cannot be replaced is the
20 years together, more than 20
years. Someone may promote you
better, but no one will ever
understand you better. And if you
do choose to leave, I for one will
be very lonely. Very lonely
Colonel makes his way over to the elevator. Elvis, battling his emotions within. Beyond the glass, the cars waiting to leave.
COLONEL
But, I think you may be lonely,
too.	You know, my boy, the truth
about the Rock of Eternity, is
that it is forever just beyond our
reach.

Elvis looks back to Colonel as the elevator doors close. We hear the melancholy opening notes of “Are You Lonesome Tonight”:
ELVIS (V.O.)
(vocal)
Are you lonesome tonight?
Do you miss me tonight?
Are you sorry we drifted apart?
EXT. INTERNATIONAL HOTEL - SUNSET
VERY WIDE: As “Are You Lonesome Tonight” builds, the elevator travels up the huge, brutal facade of the hotel.
ELVIS (V.O.)
(vocal)
Does your memory stray,
To a brighter summer day?
When I kissed you and called you
sweetheart?
INT. INTERNATIONAL HOTEL - ELVIS’ ROOM - SUNSET
As Elvis enters, “Are You Lonesome Tonight” plays.
ELVIS (V.O.)
(vocal)
Honey, you lied when you said you
loved me,
And I had no cause to doubt you
Elvis stands, staring out the hotel window as the sun sets over Vegas...  The loneliest man in the world.
ELVIS (V.O.)
(vocal)
But I'd rather go on hearing your
lies,
Than go on, living without you
INT. INTERNATIONAL HOTEL - COLONEL’S SUITE - SUNSET
Colonel sits in his suite, staring at the telephone.
ELVIS (V.O.)

Is your heart filled with pain?
Shall I come back again?

INT. INTERNATIONAL HOTEL - ELVIS’ ROOM - SUNSET
Elvis sits behind the piano, he plays a few notes and sings, barely audibly, to himself.
ELVIS
(sings)
Tell me, dear, are you lonesome
tonight... 
Vernon approaches timidly, just looking at Elvis. A long moment. Elvis doesn’t turn to him, but speaks with heartbroken disgust:
ELVIS
Daddy, tell that sonofabitch I
want things to go back to the way
they were.
As Vernon heads to the door, Elvis gathers up two remote controls, closing the curtains and clicking on the TVs.
ELVIS
And, Daddy... 
Elvis flops down into the sunken lounge.
ELVIS
Tell the Colonel to send up Dr
Nick.
ELVIS (V.O.)

Tell me, dear, are you lonesome

EXT. TARMAC - YEARS LATER
Vernon stands outside Elvis’ limo, watching as Priscilla’s car pulls up. The Lisa Marie jet nearby, engines roaring.
Taking Lisa Marie in his arms, Vernon heads towards
Priscilla. Lisa runs to her mommy and after a moment,
Priscilla hands her to a nanny.
Vernon looks to Priscilla as she passes.
INT. LIMO - CONTINUOUS ACTION
A knock. Elvis glances up as Priscilla gets in.

After a long, taut silence, Elvis, discombobulated, does what he always does in moments like this. Without looking up to Priscilla, he sings under his breath.
ELVIS
(sings)
If I should stay I would only be
in your way
And so I'll go, but I know I'll
think of you each step of the way
And I will... 
He stops, unable to complete the line from this now very famous song.
PRISCILLA
That’s beautiful.
ELVIS
(weakly)
Dolly Parton wanted me to record
it.
PRISCILLA
And?
ELVIS
(unengaged)
Publishing and what not. It’s not
gonna happen.
She reaches across and touches him gently.
PRISCILLA
How are you doing?
Elvis doesn’t respond.
PRISCILLA
Honey, there’s this place you can
go in San Diego where you can
rest.
Elvis looks up, connecting with her for the first time.
PRISCILLA
Heal. After the show, you can fly
there directly, and be in the
clinic before anyone knows. It’s
all been arranged.
ELVIS
‘Cilla I’m gonna be forty soon.
Forty. Forty years old. And people
are not gonna remember me.

Colonel... 
They laugh together.
PRISCILLA
Please go...  For Lisa. Promise me?
If you dream it, you’ll do it.
But Elvis cuts her off:
ELVIS
I’m all out of dreams.
She’s done her best. A knock at the door.
EXT. TARMAC - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Elvis gets out of the car, Priscilla gets out on the opposite side. They’re about to part, but instinctively stop for a moment, looking to each other across the roof.
Elvis’ voice is lost to the roar of the engines as he mouths the final lyric to the song he could not sing: “I will always love you.”
They part, and Elvis heads for the plane as the song “Separate Ways” begins.

OLD COLONEL

First thing I did was pick up that

was crying, I said to his father
Vernon, ‘let's get to work.’ Do
you know why?	I had to keep him
traveling endlessly toward the
Rock of Eternity-- because that’s
what he would have wanted. The
only relationship to which he was
forever true, was to you, his
audience.
INT. INTERNATIONAL HOTEL - SHOWROOM - NIGHT (1977)
Elvis performs his final concert.
OLD COLONEL (V.O.)
The very last time I saw him sing,
he could seldom stand... 
He’s shockingly overweight, heaving for breath, slurring.
ELVIS
This song is uh, I just recorded
it...  I don’t know h-h-h-ahhh. Is
it out?
CHARLIE
About two weeks.
ELVIS
Two weeks it’ll be out? ‘Unchained
Melody’...  from an album called
Unchained Melody... 
(jokes)
Makes a lot of sense... 
He sits at the piano, mops his brow. Even though he hasn't started yet, he yells out to the audience:
ELVIS
How do you like it so far?
Cheers and laughs. Then Elvis' fingers hit the ivories... 
OLD COLONEL (V.O.)
But without fail, that voice rang
out!
Elvis' vocal begins to soar:
ELVIS

Woah, my love, my darling
I’ve hungered for your touch,
A long lonely time...

I didn't kill him. It was love.
His love for you... 
Despite his bloated look and discombobulation, Elvis hits the high note with impossible vocal beauty and strength.

Elvis has left the building!
BEEEEPPPPP. The sound of a FLATLINE.
FADE OUT.
