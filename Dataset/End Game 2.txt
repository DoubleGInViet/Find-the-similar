don't...  do
STEVE and NATASHA enter from outside.
STEVE
Breakers are set, emergency
generator’s on stand-by.
SMART HULK
Good. If we blow the grid, I don’t want to lose Tiny back in the ‘50’s.
SCOTT LANG
Excuse me?
NATASHA
He was kidding.
SMART HULK
I was kidding.
36
NATASHA
(to Hulk)
You were kidding, right?
SMART HULK
Honestly, I have no idea.	We’re
attempting time travel.	Either
it’s all a joke, or none of it is.
(loudly to Scott)
We’re good!	Helmet on.
Scott puts on his helmet, slightly dubious.
SMART HULK (CONT'D) Okay. I’m going to send you back one week, give you an hour to look around, then bring you back in ten seconds. Make sense?
SCOTT LANG
Perfectly not confusing.
STEVE
Good luck, Scott.	You’ve got this.
SCOTT LANG
(inspired)
Yes, I do, Captain America.	Yes, I-
SMART HULK PULLS A LEVER.	SCOTT SHRINKS TO NOTHING.
SMART HULK
Counting down from three, two,
one...  
SUDDENLY SCOTT REAPPEARS...  BUT HE’S 12-YEARS-OLD.
SCOTT LANG
Uh, guys?	This doesn’t feel right.
NATASHA
Is that Scott?
SMART HULK
Probably...  ?
He scrambles, hitting buttons.	SCOTT SHRINKS TO NOTHING.
STEVE
Get him back!
Smart Hulk flips a switch.	SCOTT REAPPEARS...  AT AGE 93.
37
SCOTT LANG
Oh, my back!
NATASHA
Bruce! Get it under control. What the hell is going on?
SMART HULK
I got it, I know exactly what’s
going on.	Pretty much.
SCOTT SHRINKS TO NOTHING AGAIN. HULK TYPES FRANTICALLY with A PENCIL, fingers too big for the keys.
2-YEAR OLD SCOTT APPEARS.
NATASHA
Oh, my God.
STEVE
It’s a baby.
SMART HULK
It’s Scott.
STEVE
As a baby!
Smart Hulk hits a button.	Baby Scott disappears.
SMART HULK
When I tell you, kill the power!
(throwing a switch)
Now!
NATASHA KILLS THE POWER.	Normal Scott stumbles off the pad.
SCOTT LANG
Somebody peed my pants.	I don’t
know if it was baby-me or old-me.
Or just me-me.
EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, HANGAR - DAY
Steve leans on the wall, discouraged. Then he hears AN ENGINE ROAR. AN AUDI races up the drive.
It stops, the window rolling down to reveal...  TONY.
TONY
Why the long face? Wild guess, he turned into a baby?
38
STEVE
Among other things.
TONY
(getting out of the car)
EPR Paradox. Instead of pushing Lang through time, you were pushing time through Lang. It’s dangerous. I probably should’ve cautioned you against it.
STEVE
You did.
TONY
Thank god, I’m here. Regardless, I fixed it.
He holds up...  HIS STAR-SHAPED CAPACITOR.
TONY (CONT'D)
That is a fully-functioning, time-space GPS. I just want peace. Resentment is corrosive. I hate it.
STEVE
Me, too.
Something eases between them, for the first time in years.
TONY
We’ve got a shot at the Stones. I just need you to know my priorities. Bring back everyone we lost, hopefully. Keep what I found, definitely. And, let’s not die trying.
Steve looks at Tony.	Finally, he offers his hand.
STEVE
Sounds like a deal.
They shake.	This is a long time coming.	Finally...  
TONY
But wait, there’s more. Act now, and it comes with a bonus offer.
Tony pops the trunk.	Steve stares, moved, at...  HIS SHIELD.
STEVE
Tony, I don’t know-
39
TONY
What’s to know?	He made it for
you.	Plus, I gotta get it out of
the garage before Morgan takes it
sledding.
Steve finally picks up the shield, SLIDING IT ONTO HIS ARM.
STEVE
Thank you, Tony.
Tony chokes up, then covers by slamming the trunk.
TONY
Just don’t flaunt it.	I didn’t
bring enough for the whole team.
We are getting the whole team,
right?
STEVE
We’re trying.
EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, HANGAR - DAY
SCOTT sits on a bench, eating a hardshell taco. THEN A MASSIVE EXHAUST WIND BLASTS HIM, blowing his taco away.
THE BENATAR lands outside AVENGERS COMPOUND. NEBULA AND ROCKET EMERGE. Rocket waits at the end of the gangway.
ROCKET
Hey, Humie.	Where’s Big Green?
SCOTT LANG
Um, kitchen, I think.
Scott tries a smile at Nebula.	She just hits her COM:
NEBULA (INTO COM)
Rhodey, careful on re-entry.
There’s an idiot in the landing
zone.
She goes in.	THEN, WHAM, WAR MACHINE LANDS, STARTLING SCOTT.
SCOTT LANG
Oh, my God!
RHODEY
What’s up, Regular-Sized Man?
Rhodey goes inside as SMART HULK walks out, carrying an overnight bag. He hands Scott some tacos.
40
ROCKET
Finally.	I ain’t got all day.
SMART HULK
I call shotgun!
As he walks up the Benatar’s gangway, PRE-LAP A METALLIC SCRAPING SOUND.
EXT. NEW ASGARD - DAY
The scraping goes on as we see...  A NORWEGIAN FISHING VILLAGE.
Tilt to a sign: “NEW ASGARD,” in English and ASGARDIAN RUNES.
A PICK-UP passes, scraping the pavement: SMART HULK AND ROCKET SIT IN BACK, WEIGHING DOWN THE TRUCK.
EXT. NEW ASGARD, VILLAGE - DAY
SMART HULK AND ROCKET WALK THROUGH TOWN. ASGARDIANS IN EARTHLY CLOTHES EYE THEM WITH SUSPICION.
ROCKET
What the heck are they looking at?
SMART HULK
I’m kind of famous...  
ROCKET
Yeah, I’m sure that’s it. Kind of a step down from golden palaces and magic hammers...  
SMART HULK
They lost Asgard, then half their
people.	Maybe they’re just happy
to have a home.
VALKYRIE (O.S.)
You shouldn’t have come.
VALKYRIE approaches from the pier.	Smart Hulk GRINS.
SMART HULK
Hey, Valkyrie!	Great to see you!
He goes for a hug...  VAL DOESN’T.	She studies the new him.
VALKYRIE
Uh huh. I liked you better either of the other ways.
41
SMART HULK
This is Rocket.
ROCKET
Hey.
VALKYRIE
Hey.
(to both)
He won’t see you.
SMART HULK
We didn’t say we were here to see-
VALKYRIE
Great, then you can hose out the
gut buckets-
ROCKET
We’re definitely here to see him.
VALKYRIE
He can’t give you what you need.
SMART HULK
It’s that bad?
VALKYRIE
We only see him once a month. When he comes in for “supplies.”
She nods to A DOZEN BEER KEGS STACKED OUTSIDE A PUB.
EXT. NEW ASGARD, CABIN - DAY
Smart Hulk and Rocket knock on the door of A CABIN.	Nothing.
INT. NEW ASGARD, CABIN - DAY
SMART HULK opens the door. PIZZA BOXES and LIQUOR BOTTLES litter the floor. Rocket recoils.
ROCKET
Something died in here.
SMART HULK
Hello...  ?	Thor...  ?
THOR (O.S.)
Are you here about the cable?
We hear a HEAVY SHUFFLING as someone approaches.
42
THOR (CONT'D)
Cinemax went out two days ago, and the sports are all...  fuzzy...  
THOR enters, CONFUSED, A LITTLE DRUNK, SHIRTLESS...  AND TREMENDOUSLY FAT. Rocket and Hulk stare.
SMART HULK
Thor?
THOR
BROS!	Bring it in!
Thor hugs Smart Hulk.	He turns to Rocket, who steps back.
ROCKET
Yeah, I’m good.
THOR
Hulk, you know my boys, Korg and
Miek, right?
KORG and MIEK sit on the couch, playing Playstation 4.
KORG
Beer’s in the bucket. Feel free to log on to the WiFi.
SMART HULK
Hey, guys.	Long time no-
KORG
Thor!	This kid on the TV just
called me a dickhead!
THOR
Noobmaster again?
KORG
NoobMaster69 called me a dickhead-
Thor snatches KORG’S HEADSET and hisses into the mic.
THOR
Noobmaster, this is Thor, again. God of Thunder. This is your last warning. Log off this game or I will come to your basement, rip off your arms and shove them up your butt.
(handing the headset back)
Right, who wants a drink?
43
SMART HULK AND ROCKET JUST STARE. Thor pulls a beer from the fridge, and whacks the cap against STORMBREAKER.
SMART HULK
Hey, buddy, are you all right?
THOR
Don’t I look all right?
ROCKET
(under his breath)
You look like melted ice cream-
THOR
So, what’s up?	Just here for a
hang?
SMART HULK
We need your help.	There’s a
chance we can fix everything.
THOR
Like the cable?	It’s driving me
bananas.
SMART HULK
Like Thanos.
THOR GRABS HULK’S SHIRT, INTENSE.	KORG RISES FROM THE COUCH.
THOR
Don’t say that name.
KORG
Yeah, we don’t say that name in
here.
Smart Hulk looks down at THOR’S HAND STILL ON HIS SHIRT.
SMART HULK
Please take your hand off me.
Thor looks into Hulk’s eyes...  and gently removes his hand.
SMART HULK (CONT'D)
Now, I know the thought of...  that
guy might scare you-
THOR
Scared?	Why would I be scared of
that guy?	I’m the one who killed
that guy, remember?
(looking around)
Anyone else here kill that guy?
(MORE)
44
THOR (CONT'D)
Didn’t think so.	Korg, tell
everyone who chopped Thanos’ head
off.
KORG
Stormbreaker?
Thor uncaps a whiskey bottle.	BLAM, IT SHATTERS IN HIS HAND.
Reveal...  ROCKET, BLASTER SMOKING.
THOR
Not.	Cool.	Man.
ROCKET
Don’t.	Care.	Dude.
SMART HULK
Look, I get it. You’re in a rough patch. I’ve been there. But you know who helped me out of it?
THOR
Was it Natasha?
SMART HULK
It was you. You helped me. And I need you to help me again.
THOR
Ask the Asgardians down there how
much “my help” is worth.
ROCKET
At least they’re alive-
THOR
They were gods!	Now they’re
fisherpeople!
(sagging into a chair)
The ones that are left, anyway.
SMART HULK
That’s the thing.	I think we can
bring them back.
Thor’s tempted, but shakes his head.
THOR
Stop. Stop. I know you think I’m down here, wallowing in my own self-pity, waiting to be rescued. But I’m fine. I’m happy. Whatever it is you’re offering, don’t care. Couldn’t care less.
45
Hulk and Rocket stare at Thor.
SMART HULK
Come on, pal.	We need you.
He still can’t meet their gaze.	Finally...  
ROCKET
There’s beer in the ship.
THOR
(beat)
What kind?
EXT. TOKYO - NIGHT
A KARAOKE BAR LIES IN RUINS AS A TINNY POP SONG PLAYS.
BLOOD POOLS BENEATH DEAD YAKUZA THUGS, UZIS JUST OUT OF REACH OF THEIR TATTOOED HANDS.
TITLE: “TOKYO.”
AS WE PULL BACK...  THE MUSIC FADES, REPLACED BY A SOFT CRYING.
A TERRIFIED HOSTESS DARTS FROM COVER, WIPING AWAY THE CHYRON.
KEEP PULLING BACK...  PAST A CAR SMASHED THROUGH THE FRONT WINDOW, TATTOOED DRIVER SLUMPED OVER THE WHEEL, GUN IN HAND.
WE HEAR RAIN, A REVVING ENGINE, AND THEN GUNFIRE.
PULL ONTO THE SIDEWALK, TURNING JUST AS A MOTORCYCLE CRASHES, RIDER TUMBLING PAST US IN A WHITE MOHAWKED HELMET.
ANOTHER MOTORCYCLE RACES TOWARD US, BUT...  
WHFT-WHFT, TWO ARROWS SEND THE RIDER SKIDDING INTO A WALL, TIRES SQUEALING AS THE BIKE SPINS HELPLESSLY ON ITS SIDE.
CAMERA TURNS TOWARD AN ALCOVE, WHERE A YAKUZA THUG TUMBLES OFF THE STAIRS AS...  
A MASKED FIGURE HEADS UP, STOPPING MOMENTARILY TO DRAW HIS TELESCOPING BLADE.
BEHIND THE SMOKED GLASS OF SECOND FLOOR WINDOWS, THE FIGURE FIGHTS ANOTHER THUG. THEN...  
CRASH, THE THUG COMES SMASHING THROUGH THE WINDOW.	THUD.
WHIP THROUGH THE RAIN TO THE UPPER FLOORS OF THE BUILDING.
GUNFIRE FLASHES AS THE FIGHT CONTINUES PAST THREE WINDOWS...  
46
SUDDENLY, THE FOURTH WINDOW SHATTERS AS A YAKUZA BOSS, AKIHIKO, LEAPS OVER THE SIDEWALK...  
LANDING ON THE METAL AWNING OF A NOODLE SHOP. HE ROLLS TO THE WET STREET, LANDING HARD ON HIS ANKLE.
THE MYSTERIOUS FIGURE GRACEFULLY LEAPS AFTER HIM, BOUNCING OFF THE AWNING AND DROPPING TO THE STREET BELOW.
RACK UP TO GET OUR BEST LOOK YET AT...  RONIN. HARD-SET EYES STARE AT AKIHIKO THROUGH A BLACK MASK. THEY BATTLE.
AKIHIKO
(Japanese, subtitled)
Why are you doing this?	We never
did anything to you!
RONIN
(Japanese, subtitled)
You survived. Half the planet didn’t. They got Thanos. You get me.
Akihiko attacks.	Ronin slashes him across the middle.
RONIN (CONT'D)
(Japanese, subtitled)
You’re done hurting people.
Akihiko gestures at the bodies in the street.
AKIHIKO
We hurt people?	You’re crazy.
Ronin slashes Akihiko’s throat.	The man drops to his knees.
AKIHIKO (CONT'D)
Wait!	Help me!	I’ll give you
anything!	What do you want?
RONIN
What I want...  you can’t give me.
Ronin finishes him off.	AKIHIKO GOES STILL.	SIRENS WAIL.
Ronin removes his mask, revealing...  
CLINT BARTON, haggard. He hears A FOOTFALL. He whirls, katana raised...  then stops. His face goes slack as...  
NATASHA STEPS INTO A POOL OF LIGHT, A LARGE BLACK UMBRELLA KEEPING HER FROM THE RAIN.
They stare at each other.	Clint hasn’t seen her in years.
She hasn’t seen what he’s become.
47
CLINT BARTON
You shouldn’t be here.
NATASHA
Neither should you.
CLINT BARTON
I’ve got a job to do.
NATASHA
That what you’re calling this?
She moves even closer.	He stiffens.
NATASHA (CONT'D)
Killing these people isn’t going to bring your family back.
(beat)
We found something.	A chance,
maybe...  
CLINT BARTON
Don’t.
NATASHA
Don’t what?
CLINT BARTON
Give me hope.
NATASHA
I’m just sorry I couldn’t give it
sooner.
CLINT DISSOLVES, sagging into her arms.
INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, HANGAR - DAY
THOR STANDS WITH A BEER IN A COZY, staring at A NEW QUANTUM TUNNEL (2.0), AFFIXED WITH TONY’S CAPACITOR.
TONY (O.S.)
Out of the way, Lebowski.
Thor shuffles aside as Tony blows past.
TONY (CONT'D)
Hey, Ratchet, you get lost in
there?
ROCKET (O.S.)
It’s Rocket, and shut up.	You’re
only a genius on Earth, pal.
48
TONY
And you’re only in there because
you have tiny hands.
ROCKET, COVERED IN GREASE, WRIGGLES OUT A HATCH.
ROCKET
Fixed it.
TONY
Thank you.
ROCKET
Get used to saying that.
INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, WORKSHOP - DAY
SMART HULK fits SCOTT with A BRAND NEW TIME SUIT. NEBULA ASSISTS. RHODEY enters the workshop, eyeing the suit.
RHODEY
Time travel suit, I like it.
SMART HULK awkwardly tries to fit a pair of RED TEST TUBES INTO THE TIME SUIT’S BELT.
SCOTT LANG
Easy, easy.	Careful with those.
SMART HULK
I’m being very careful-
SCOTT LANG
You’re being very Hulky-
Scott takes the tubes from him and inserts them, himself.
SCOTT LANG (CONT'D) These are Pym Particles. You can’t shrink to the Quantum Realm without them, and since Hank Pym got snapped out of existence, we can’t make any more. I told you. We’ve only got enough for one round trip each, no do-overs.
Scott gently clicks the tubes into their housing.
SCOTT LANG (CONT'D)
Plus two test runs-
SUDDENLY, SCOTT SHRINKS INTO NOTHING, THEN GROWS BACK. He takes that in...  
49
SCOTT LANG (CONT'D)
One test run.
(embarrassed)
Okay, maybe I’m not ready.
CLINT BARTON (O.S.)
I’m game.
They turn to see CLINT leaning in the doorway.
CLINT BARTON (CONT'D)
I’ll do it.
TIME CUT:
NOW, CLINT WEARS THE TIME SUIT.	Scott looks on, sulky.
SMART HULK, RHODEY, and NEBULA attach the Pym housing.
SMART HULK
Okay, Clint, you might feel a
little disoriented when you
chronoshift-
RHODEY
Hang on, I’ve got to ask, if we can do this, why don’t we just go find baby Thanos and, you know...  
Rhodey makes a STRANGLING GESTURE.
SMART HULK
Uh, one, because that’s horrible. And, two, killing baby Thanos doesn’t kill adult Thanos. Time doesn’t work like that. You can’t change the future by changing the past.
SCOTT LANG
Sure, we can. We take the stones before Thanos gets them, then he doesn’t have them. Problem solved.
NEBULA
That’s not how it works.
CLINT BARTON
I don’t know.	That is kind of what
I’ve heard-
SMART HULK
Heard from who?
50
RHODEY
Star Trek.	Terminator.	Bill and
Ted’s Excellent-
SMART HULK
WHY DOES EVERYONE THINK THIS?
THAT’S NOT TRUE.	IF YOU TRAVEL TO
THE PAST, THEN THAT PAST HAS BECOME
YOUR PRESENT, AND YOUR FORMER
PRESENT HAS BECOME THE PAST, WHICH
NOW CAN’T BE CHANGED BY YOUR NEW
FUTURE!
NEBULA
Exactly.
RHODEY
Excuse me?
Scott leans over, whispering:
SCOTT LANG
Apparently, Back to the Future is bullshit.
CLINT BARTON
Look, are we doing this or not?
INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, HANGAR - DAY
CLINT WAITS ALONE ON THE PLATFORM, WEARING THE TIME SUIT.
SMART HULK readies THE QUANTUM CONSOLE as ROCKET, RHODEY, NEBULA, THOR, and STEVE look on.
SMART HULK
Okay, Clint.	Starting in three,
two, one...  
Clint nods over at them, determined. SUDDENLY, HE STRETCHES, SHRINKS, AND VANISHES. WHOOSH.
EXT. BARTON HOME, BARN - DAY
Through the slats of a barn, we see a tractor. ENERGY FLARES, REVEALING CLINT BARTON IN A TIME SUIT.
He walks to the open door, staring at...  HIS OLD HOME.
51
EXT./INT. BARTON HOME, FRONT PORCH - DAY
Clint climbs the porch. He accidentally kicks...  A BASEBALL MITT. Then he hears VOICES.
He stares into the house through THE SCREEN DOOR. From the sounds of it, LAURA and THE KIDS are making dinner.
HIS DAUGHTER LAUGHS. Clint’s face crumples. Just then...  HIS QUANTUM CUFF VIBRATES. A SCREEN COUNTS DOWN: 0:03.
CLINT BARTON
No.	Not yet...  
(opening the door)
LILA!
BUT HIS BODY STARTS TO GLOW. 0.01- CLINT VANISHES. THE SCREEN DOOR SLAMS. After a moment, LILA runs in.
LILA BARTON
Dad?
INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, HANGAR - DAY
CLINT APPEARS ON THE PAD, SHAKEN.	TONY and NATASHA approach.
NATASHA
Are you all right?	Hey, look at
me.	You okay?
TONY
Tell me something good...  
Clint looks up, tearful.	He holds out THE BASEBALL MITT.
CLINT BARTON
It worked.	It worked.
Reveal Steve, Smart Hulk, Nebula, Rhodey, Scott, Thor, and Rocket, looking on.
ROCKET
Holy crap.	We’re freaking time
travelers.
INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, LIVING AREA, DAY 1 - DAY (MOCO)
On a HOLO-BOARD: “MIND, SPACE, TIME, POWER, REALITY, SOUL.” Above each word hovers...  ITS ARTIFACT:
LOKI’S SCEPTER, THE TESSERACT, THE EYE OF AGAMOTTO, THE ORB, THE AETHER CONTAINER, AND A QUESTION MARK.
52
STEVE
Okay. Now that we’ve got how, we’re going to need where and when.
NEBULA, TONY, RHODEY, SCOTT, SMART HULK, ROCKET, NATASHA, and CLINT look on.
STEVE (CONT'D)
Most folks here have encountered at least one of the six Infinity Stones-
TONY
I think you mean nearly been killed by one of the six Infinity Stones.
SCOTT LANG
I haven’t.
(off their looks)
Just...  saying.
SMART HULK
Regardless, we’ve only got enough
Pym Particles for one round trip,
each.	And the Stones have been in
a lot of places throughout history.
TONY
Our history.	Not all of them are
going to be a fun drop-in.
CLINT BARTON
Which means we’ve got to pick our
targets.
STEVE
Exactly.
(he taps “REALITY”)
Let’s start with the Aether. Thor, what do we know?
Everyone looks toward...  THOR, slumped over.
NATASHA
Is he asleep?
RHODEY
I’m pretty sure he’s dead.
DISSOLVE TO:
THOR sulks, looking at the Aether Container Holo: “REALITY”
Locations are listed: “SVARTALFHEIM, KNOWHERE, LONDON.”
53
THOR
The Aether’s not a stone, it’s more of an angry sludge. My grandfather hid it from Dark Elves in a rock between dimensions that can only be accessed every 5000 years.
HIS ROBOTIC EYE drifts off in the wrong direction. Thor bangs his head, resetting his eye.
THOR (CONT'D)
Or...  by Jane. She stuck her hand in a rock. Then the Aether stuck itself inside her. Then I took her to Asgard. We were dating...  
(depressed)
We’re not anymore.
Everyone stares.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, LIVING AREA, DAY 2 - DAY (MOCO)
CLOSE ON a holo image of THE ORB: “POWER.”	Locations are
listed: “MORAG ?-2014, KYLN 2014, XANDAR 2014-2018.”
FIND ROCKET AS HE SLURPS FROM A CONTAINER OF LO MEIN.
ROCKET
Quill said he stole the Power Stone from Morag.
He paces on top of the table, past SMART HULK EATING A PINT OF “HUNKA HULKA BURNING FUDGE.”
SMART HULK
That’s a person?
ROCKET
It’s a planet.	Quill was a person.
SCOTT LANG
Wait, like a planet...  in space?
Rocket pinches Scott’s cheek.
ROCKET
Aw, look.	It’s like a puppy, all
happy and everything.
(MORE)
54
ROCKET (CONT'D)
You want to go to space, puppy?
I’ll take you to space.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, SITTING AREA - DAY
Scott, Steve, Natasha, Clint, Rocket, and Smart Hulk sit quietly, listening to Nebula.
NEBULA
Thanos found the Soul Stone on
Vormir.
NATASHA
And that is...  ?
NEBULA
A dominion of death at the very
center of celestial existence.
(beat)
It’s the place where Thanos
murdered my sister.
That hangs heavily.	A moment passes.	Then...  
SCOTT LANG
Not it.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, OFFICE - DAY, EARLY
Tony, Natasha, and Smart Hulk hash it out.
NATASHA
So this ‘Time Stone’ guy...  what
kind of doctor was he?
SMART HULK
Strange?
TONY
Cross between ear-nose-and-throat
and rabbit-from-hat.
SMART HULK
Had a nice place in the Village.
TONY
Yeah.	Sullivan Street.
55
SMART HULK
Bleecker.
TONY
Sullivan and Bleecker.	They’re
cross streets.
NATASHA
Wait, he lived in New York? Guys, pick the right year and there were three stones in New York.
SMART HULK
(beat)
Shut the front door...  
INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, LIVING AREA, DAY 3 - DAY
STEVE blocks our view.
STEVE
Okay, we have a plan. Six stones, three teams, one shot.
He steps away, revealing the board...  
EVERYONE EYES THE TANGLE OF LINES CONNECTING SIX STONES TO FOUR LOCATIONS TO TWO YEARS TO TEN HEROES. IT’S INSANE.
INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, HANGAR - DAWN
DAWN RISES OUTSIDE HUGE WINDOWS. OUR HEROES MARCH PAST IN THEIR TIME SUITS.
STEVE (O.S.)
Five years ago, we lost.	All of
us.
INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, HANGAR - DAY
THE HEROES GATHER ON THE QUANTUM PLATFORM.
STEVE
We lost friends.	We lost family.
We lost a part of ourselves.
(beat)
But today we have a chance to take it all back.
Steve takes in the groupings of heroes: RHODEY & NEBULA, NAT & CLINT, THOR & ROCKET, TONY & SCOTT.
56
STEVE (CONT'D)
You have your teams and you have
assignments.	Get your stone, and
get back here.	One round trip
each.	No mistakes.	No do-overs.
He grips HIS SHIELD.
STEVE (CONT'D)
Most of us are going back to places we know. That doesn’t mean we know what to expect. Be careful. Look out for each other. Improvise, if you have to.
(looking around)
This is the fight of our lives.
And we’re going to win.
(beat)
Whatever it takes.
The platform stays quiet.	Rocket WHISPERS to Scott:
ROCKET
He’s pretty good at that...  
Scott nods enthusiastically.
TONY
(to Smart Hulk)
All right, you heard the man.
Stroke those keys, Jolly Green.
Smart Hulk taps in commands with HIS PENCIL. LIGHTS ILLUMINATE EACH PAD.
SMART HULK
Tracking beacons engaged.
Clint checks his pocket: A SHRUNKEN BENATAR sits inside.
ROCKET
You promise to bring that thing
back in one piece?
CLINT BARTON
Yeah, sure thing.	I’ll do my best.
ROCKET
That’s pretty lame, as far as
promises go.
SMART HULK STEPS ONTO THE PLATFORM, COMPLETING THE LINEUP.
THE PLATFORM BEGINS TO VIBRATE.	NATASHA LOOKS AROUND.
57
NATASHA
See you in a minute.
SMART HULK
Actually, it’ll be closer to seven or eight microseconds, give or-
SUDDENLY, THEY STRETCH AND VANISH, SHRINKING AWAY.	WHOOSH.
THE QUANTUM CONSOLE STOPS VIBRATING. HULK’S PENCIL SLOWLY ROLLS TOWARD THE EDGE...  AND DROPS OFF-
EXT. NEW YORK CITY - DAY (AVENGERS 1)
TITLE: NEW YORK, 2012
THE BATTLE OF NEW YORK RAGES. IN THE MIDDLE OF IT ALL, THE AVENGERS GATHER IN A CIRCLE, FACING IMPOSSIBLE ODDS.
At the same time, just a block away...  
EXT. NEW YORK CITY, ALLEY - CONTINUOUS (AVENGERS 1)
FLASH! STEVE, SMART HULK, TONY, and SCOTT arrive at the mouth of an alley, just out of sight.
TONY
Okay, Park Avenue’s that way.
Let’s huddle up.	Suits off.
They all touch their cuffs, RETRACTING THEIR TIME SUITS.
STEVE
We’ve all got our assignments. Two stones uptown, one stone down. Stay low, keep an eye on time-
Just then, A1 HULK BOUNDS DOWN THE STREET SMASHING THINGS.
STEVE (CONT'D)
And Bruce?	Maybe smash a few
things along the way.	For
appearances.
SMART HULK
(taking off his shirt)
All right, but I have to say, it
seems gratuitous.
He half-heartedly smashes a few cars.
58
SMART HULK (CONT'D)
Grrr...  grrr...  
EXT. SANCTUM SANCTORUM, ROOF - DAY (AVENGERS 1)
THE BATTLE OF NEW YORK RAGES. CHITAURI CHARIOTS ZOOM OVER THE VILLAGE. SUDDENLY...  BOOM, THE CHARIOTS EXPLODE.
ON ONE SIDE OF THE SANCTUM ROOF, A TINY, HOODED FIGURE hurls jagged mandalas into the sky.
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOF...  SMART HULK LANDS. He heads for a door, but...  
ANCIENT ONE (O.S.)
I’d be careful going that way...  
He turns to find...  THE ANCIENT ONE STARING AT HIM.
ANCIENT ONE (CONT'D)
We just had the floors waxed.
SMART HULK THINKS, THEN GROWLS, TRYING TO INTIMIDATE HER.
SMART HULK
Hulk...  does what...  Hulk want?
ANCIENT ONE
Yes, I suppose that would be the
case-
JUST THEN, ON THE ROOF OPPOSITE, A1 HULK TACKLES A CHITAURI CHARIOT, RIPPING IT IN HALF. HE ROARS, LEAPING AWAY.
Smart Hulk blinks, sheepish.	The Ancient One looks at him.
ANCIENT ONE (CONT'D)
Care to explain?
SMART HULK
I’m looking for Dr. Strange.
ANCIENT ONE
You’re about five years too early. Stephen Strange is currently performing surgery, 20 blocks that way. What do you want with him?
He finally notices THE EYE OF AGAMOTTO HANGING FROM HER NECK.
SMART HULK
Well, that, actually.
59
ANCIENT ONE
Ah.	I’m afraid not.
SMART HULK
I’m seriously sorry but...  I wasn’t asking.
Smart Hulk cracks his knuckles and moves in.	She smiles.
ANCIENT ONE
You don’t want to do this.
SMART HULK
You’re right, I don’t. But I need that stone, and I don’t have a lot of time to debate it-
He reaches for it. THE ANCIENT ONE SLAMS HER PALM INTO HIS CHEST AND BLASTS BRUCE BANNER RIGHT OUT OF SMART HULK.
“ASTRAL BANNER” hangs in the air, staring at his frozen Smart Hulk body. He looks at his human hands, overwhelmed.
ASTRAL BANNER
No, no, no-
She topples Smart Hulk’s body with one finger.	Whump.
ANCIENT ONE
Now.	Let’s start over, shall we?
INT. ASGARD, PALACE, CORRIDOR - DAY (THOR 2)
TITLE: ASGARD, 2013
AN ASGARDIAN MAIDEN stands at JANE’S ROOM, handing over A GREEN DRESS.
MAIDEN (O.S.)
For you, Lady Jane.
JANE FOSTER (O.S.)
Um, do you have anything
with...  pants?
MAIDEN (O.S.)
Pants?
JANE FOSTER (O.S.)
It’s okay.	Nevermind.
Pull back to...  ROCKET AND THOR, WATCHING from behind a crypt.
Rocket holds a syringe-like EXTRACTION DEVICE.
60
THOR
That’s Jane.
ROCKET
Okay, here’s the deal. You’re going to charm her, and I’m going to poke her with this thing, extract the Reality Stone, and get gone lickety-split.
Thor looks off in the other direction, anxious.
THOR
Um, I’ll be right back. The wine cellar is just down here. My father used to have this barrel of Aakonian ale. Felt like getting hit in the face with a poleaxe. I’ll see if the scullery has a couple of to-go cups-
They hear SOMEONE APPROACHING. Rocket yanks Thor back as...  FRIGGA AND HER HANDMAIDENS ENTER THE CORRIDOR.
FRIGGA
Send Loki some soup. I don’t think he’s eating. And ask our librarians to pull some volumes from the astronomy shelves. He won’t read them, but at least they’ll keep him company.
Thor watches Frigga and her coterie disappear down the hall.
ROCKET
Who’s the fancy broad?
THOR
My mother.	She dies today.
ROCKET
Oh, jeez.
Thor starts to sweat.
THOR
I can’t do this.	This is a bad
idea.	I can’t do this...  
Rocket climbs onto a marble monument.
ROCKET
Come here.
61
Thor steps closer.	ROCKET SLAPS HIM ACROSS THE FACE.
ROCKET (CONT'D)
You think you’re the only one who’s lost people? What do you think we’re doing here? I lost the only family I ever had. Quill, Groot, Drax, the chick with the antenna. All gone. I’ve lived five meaningless years without them, and every minute has blown Aaskvarian gornads. I get you miss your mom. But she’s gone. Really gone. There are plenty of people who are only kind of gone. And you can help them. So, is it too much to ask that you brush the crumbs out of your beard, make shmoopy talk to Prettypants, and when she’s not looking, suck out the Infinity Stone, and help me get my family back?
Thor stares at him a long moment.	He wipes his tears away.
THOR
I guess not.
ROCKET
Good.
THOR
Thank you.	I can do this.
ROCKET
Great.
As Rocket scurries to Jane’s door, Thor murmurs to himself.
THOR
I can do this...  I can do this...  
(beat)
I can’t do this...  
ROCKET
(peering through keyhole)
All right, heartbreaker.	This is
our shot...  
Rocket turns to find...  THOR NOWHERE TO BE SEEN.
ROCKET (CONT'D)
Thor?
(holding his temples)
(MORE)
62
ROCKET (CONT'D)
I can kill him, and say the Elves
did it.
EXT. MORAG - DAY (GUARDIANS)
TITLE: MORAG, 2014
STIFF WINDS PELT THE SURFACE OF MORAG. RHODEY STEERS NEBULA AS SHE LOWERS THE ESCAPE POD FROM THE NOW FULL-SIZED BENATAR.
RHODEY
That’s it, right on that line,
Blue.	Keep dropping it.
Nearby, CLINT SURVEYS THE PLANET. GEYSERS EXPLODE. CLIFFS LOOM. AN ORLONI bites NATASHA’s boot. She kicks it away.
CLINT BARTON
(to Rhodey)
Hey, can we hurry it up?
NATASHA
Yeah, come on, chop chop, we’re on the clock, here.
RHODEY
All that?	Really helpful!
TIME CUT:
Clint and Natasha board the Benatar. Rhodey and Nebula remain on the planet’s surface.
NATASHA
Take care of yourself.
RHODEY
Get that stone and come back.	No
messing around.	You guys watch
each other’s six.
TIME CUT:
BESIDE THE POD, RHODEY AND NEBULA WATCH THE BENATAR TAKE OFF.
NEBULA
Coordinates for Vormir are laid in. All they have to do is not fall out.
63
INT. BENATAR, FLIGHT DECK - DAY (GUARDIANS)
Clint laughs, watching Natasha expertly pilot a spaceship.
NATASHA
What?
CLINT BARTON
Nothing.	Just...  we’re a long way
from Budapest.
NATASHA
(pushing the throttle)
Further every second.
EXT. MORAG - DAY (GUARDIANS)
RHODEY SCANS THE LANDSCAPE.
RHODEY
So, all we have to do is hang out, wait for this Quill guy, and follow him to the Power Stone, right?
NEBULA
Let’s take cover.	We’re not the
only ones in this reality looking
for the stones.
RHODEY
Hey, who are you talking about right now? Who else is looking for the stones?
NEBULA
My father.	My sister.	And me.
MOVE IN ON RHODEY, CONCERNED.
RHODEY
You?	Where are you?
CUT TO:
EXT. BATTLEFIELD, ALIEN PLANET - DAY
BAD NEBULA CUTS DOWN A KORBINITE SOLDIER WITH DUAL BLADES.
She leads Thanos’ troops onward as they lay waste to the Korbinite home world. JUST THEN...  
64
BLAM! A GRENADE KNOCKS BAD NEBULA TO HER KNEES. TWO KORBINITE RIFLEMEN BEAR DOWN ON HER.
Suddenly, A GREEN BLUR LEAPS IN, SLICING THE RIFLEMEN’S THROATS. THE TWO HUGE SOLDIERS DROP...  
REVEALING GAMORA looking down at her sister.	Beat.
GAMORA
You’re welcome?
BAD NEBULA
I didn’t ask for your help.
GAMORA
And yet you always need it. Father wants us back on the ship.
Gamora offers her hand.	Bad Nebula stands on her own.
BAD NEBULA
Why?
GAMORA
He’s found an Infinity Stone.
Off Bad Nebula’s intrigued look...  
INT. Q-SHIP - DAY
BAD NEBULA and GAMORA study a holo-map.
BAD NEBULA
Where?
GAMORA
On a planet called “Morag.”
EXT. BATTLEFIELD, ALIEN PLANET - DAY
A DARK FIGURE ADVANCES ACROSS THE SMOKY FIELD, RELENTLESS.
BAD NEBULA (O.S.)
Father’s plan is finally in motion.
GAMORA (O.S.)
One stone isn’t six.
ALIENS RUN FOR COVER, SCREAMING.	SOMETHING CUTS THEM DOWN...  
65
BAD NEBULA (O.S.)
It’s a start.	If he gets them
all...  
THANOS steps from the smoke, armored, wielding A HUGE BLADE.
GAMORA (O.S.)
We’ll never have to do this again.
THREE ALIENS CHARGE HIM. THANOS CUTS THEM DOWN. He wipes blood from his face, and SMILES.
BAD NEBULA (O.S.)
He’ll miss it.
A SMALL FIGHTER FLIES IN, STRAFING HIM. NEVER BREAKING STRIDE, THANOS SLICES IT IN TWO.
He looks up to his ship.	A BEAM BATHES HIM IN LIGHT...  
INT. Q-SHIP - DAY
Bad Nebula and Gamora turn as THANOS ENTERS THE FLIGHT DECK.
THANOS
Ronan has located the Power Stone.
I’m dispatching you to his ship.
GAMORA
He won’t like it.
Thanos wipes the blood from his blade.
THANOS
His alternative is death. Ronan’s obsession clouds his judgement. After Loki, I’m taking no chances.
BAD NEBULA
We will not fail you, father.
Thanos finally lays his eyes on her.
THANOS
No.	You won’t.
BAD NEBULA
I swear I will make you proud-
SUDDENLY, BAD NEBULA STAGGERS, hand to the wall.
GAMORA
Sister, what’s-
66
Thanos watches, curious, as NEBULA DROPS TO A KNEE.
SUDDENLY, A HOLO-PROJECTION OF RHODEY BEAMS FROM HER EYE.
RHODEY (HOLO)
So, all we have to do is hang out, wait for this Quill guy, and follow him to the Power Stone, right?
NEBULA (HOLO) (O.S)
Let’s take cover.	We’re not the
only ones in this reality looking
for the stones.
BAD NEBULA SLUMPS, breaking the projection. Gamora goes to her, trying to prop her up.
GAMORA
Who was that?
BAD NEBULA
I...  don’t know.	My
head...  splitting...  
Bad Nebula winces.	Gamora looks to Thanos.
GAMORA
Her synaptic drive was probably
damaged in battle-
THANOS
Sshhh...  
Thanos looks down at Bad Nebula. He gently lifts her head with his blade. Something’s not right.
THANOS (CONT'D)
Bring her to my ship.
EXT. STARK TOWER, PENTHOUSE - DAY (AVENGERS 1)
Tony swoops onto the helipad outside the wrecked penthouse.
INT. STARK TOWER, PENTHOUSE - DAY (AVENGERS 1)
THE MIND STONE GLOWS IN LOKI’S SCEPTER. Pull back to see it’s in A1 NATASHA’S HANDS, as she stands with...  
A1 THOR, A1 STEVE, A1 TONY, A1 HULK, AND A1 CLINT (THE ICONIC SHOT FROM AVENGERS 1), all staring down at...  LOKI.
67
LOKI
If it’s all the same to you...  I’ll have that drink now.
From behind cover, TONY PEERS AT THE BACK SIDE OF THE AVENGERS TABLEAU.
TONY (INTO COM)
Cap, I’ve got to say that outfit
does nothing for your ass.
STEVE (OVER COM)
No one asked you to look, Tony.
REVEAL TINY SCOTT ON TONY’S SHOULDER.
SCOTT LANG (INTO COM)
I think you look great, Cap.	As
far as I’m concerned, that’s
America’s ass.
A1 NATASHA
Who gets the magic wand?
A1 STEVE
SHIELD’s coming up now.
TONY
Ball’s in play.	Head’s up, Cap.
From hiding, Tony eyes A1 NATASHA WITH LOKI’S SCEPTER.
INTERCUT:
INT. STARK TOWER, HALLWAY - DAY
STEVE negotiates an empty hallway, head on a swivel. He heads for AN ELEVATOR.
TONY (OVER COM)
Mind Stone’s on the move.
STEVE (INTO COM)
I’m in position.
INT. STARK TOWER, PENTHOUSE - DAY (AVENGERS 1)
A1 NATASHA hands LOKI’S SCEPTER to...  AGENT SITWELL. He’s about to touch the tip when...  
A1 NATASHA
Careful with that.
68
A1 CLINT pours himself A DRINK at Tony’s bar.
A1 CLINT BARTON
Unless you want your mind erased.
And not in the fun way.
Sitwell carries the scepter to THE SERVICE ELEVATOR...  WHERE A STRIKE TEAM WAITS. BROCK RUMLOW hits “down.”
BROCK RUMLOW
We promise to be extra careful.
Scott stares at Sitwell and Rumlow.
SCOTT LANG
Who are these guys?
TONY
SHIELD.	Actually, Hydra.	But we
didn’t know that yet.
SCOTT LANG
Seriously?	‘Cause it’s kind of
obvious they’re bad guys.
TONY
You’re small but you’re talking
loud.
A1 THOR WALKS LOKI PAST A1 STEVE.
A1 STEVE (INTO COM)
I’m on my way down to coordinate
search and rescue.
Loki rolls his eyes...  AND TRANSFORMS INTO A COPY OF STEVE.
LOKI/STEVE
“I’m on my way down to coordinate
search and rescue.”	I mean,
really, how do you keep your food
down?
Thor slaps A MUZZLE on Loki, who REVERTS TO HIS OWN FORM.
A1 THOR
Yes, that’s much better.
He steers his brother into THE MAIN ELEVATOR.
A1 THOR (CONT'D)
You coming, Stark?
69
Nearby, A1 TONY uses his gauntleted hand to place THE TESSERACT into AN ALUMINUM ATTACHE CASE.
A1 TONY
One sec, just packing my lunch.
TONY
All right, you’re up, Little Buddy.
There’s our stone
A1 Tony crosses to the elevator. Scott takes position, readying himself.
SCOTT LANG
All right.	Flick me.
Tony flicks Scott with a finger, sending him sailing into the ATTACHE CASE.
TONY leaps out the window, Bleeding Edge armor forming around him as he falls.
A1 Tony joins the others in the elevator.	Then...  
A1 HULK steps up to THE ALREADY CROWDED ELEVATOR. Avengers smile awkwardly. There’s no room.
A1 HULK
(angrily)
Hulk take stairs.
EXT. STARK TOWER - DAY
Tony circles around the building...  PASSING THE DESCENDING SERVICE ELEVATOR, CROWDED WITH RUMLOW’S STRIKE TEAM.
TONY (O.S.)
Okay, Cap, I make ten of them, just passing the 80th floor.
STEVE (O.S.)
Got it.	Head to the lobby.
TONY (O.S.)
Already on my way.
INT. STARK TOWER, SERVICE ELEVATOR - DAY (AVENGERS 1)
Sitwell, Rumlow, and the STRIKE TEAM descend.
70
AGENT SITWELL (INTO PHONE) Evidence secured, we are en route to Dr. List...  No, no hitches at all, Mr. Secretary...  
The car stops.	The doors open...  AND OUR STEVE GETS ON.
AGENT SITWELL (CONT'D)
Captain, I thought you were
coordinating search and rescue?
STEVE
Change of plans.
Steve glances at Rumlow, who’s holding THE SCEPTER.
BROCK RUMLOW
Cap.
STEVE
Rumlow.
The doors close.	Everyone rides in silence.	Tension mounts.
STEVE (CONT'D)
I got a call from the Secretary’s
office.	I’m going to be running
point on the scepter.
Behind him, Sitwell and Rumlow exchange a glance.
AGENT SITWELL
Sir?	I don’t understand-
STEVE
We’ve had word there might be an
attempt to steal it.
Steve reaches for the scepter, but Rumlow holds tight.
BROCK RUMLOW
Afraid we can’t allow that, Cap.
AGENT SITWELL
(pulling out his phone)
I’ll have to check with the
Director-
STEVE
No.	Trust me.	It’s okay...  
Steve leans in, drawing them all close.	Then he whispers:
71
STEVE (CONT'D)
Hail Hydra.
THEIR EYES GO WIDE.
don't do it...
