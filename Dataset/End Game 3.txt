INT. STARK TOWER, 10TH FLOOR - DAY (AVENGERS 1)
The elevator OPENS.	Steve steps out with THE SCEPTER.
Sitwell and Rumlow stare after him, amazed.
THE DOORS CLOSE.	STEVE SMILES TO HIMSELF.
INT. STARK TOWER, STAIRWELL - DAY (AVENGERS 1)
A1 HULK lumbers down the stairs, taking chunks out of corners in the tiny stairwell. He snorts, growing more pissed off.
A1 HULK
SO MANY STAIRS!
INT. STARK TOWER, LOBBY - DAY (AVENGERS 1)
A1 TONY carries the TESSERACT CASE through THE LOBBY, followed by A1 THOR and LOKI.
SWAT TROOPERS clear a path. ONE TURNS ASIDE, RAISING HIS MASK, REVEALING... OUR TONY.
TONY (INTO COM)
Okay, Thumbelina, you’re a go.
MOVE IN CLOSE on A1 TONY to see... SCOTT, HIDING IN HIS HAIR.
SCOTT LANG (INTO COM)
Bombs away.
SCOTT DROPS BENEATH TONY’S BLACK SABBATH SHIRT.
INT. TONY STARK’S SHIRT - CONTINUOUS (AVENGERS 1)
SCOTT slides down Tony’s clavicle to the RT.	He sniffs.
SCOTT LANG (INTO COM)
Is that... Axe body spray?
TONY (OVER COM)
Yeah, I had a can in the desk for emergencies. Can we focus, please?
72
SCOTT LANG (INTO COM)
I’m going inside you... NOW.
SCOTT SQUEEZES BETWEEN A1 TONY’S SKIN AND THE RT.
INT. STARK TOWER, LOBBY - DAY (AVENGERS 1)
A1 TONY, A1 THOR, and LOKI approach the door. ALEXANDER PIERCE intercepts them with a team of SHIELD AGENTS.
ALEXANDER PIERCE
Mind if I ask where you’re going?
A1 THOR
We were thinking lunch, then
Asgard.	And you are?
A1 TONY
Alexander Pierce.	He’s the guy
behind the guys behind Fury, so
don’t mess.
ALEXANDER PIERCE
My friends call me Mr. Secretary.
(to Thor)
I have to ask you to turn the
prisoner over to me.
A1 THOR
Loki will answer to Odin, himself.
ALEXANDER PIERCE
No, he’ll answer to us. “Odin” can have what’s left.
(to Tony)
And we’ll need the case back, too. That’s been SHIELD property for over seventy years.
A1 TONY
I’m not gonna argue who has authority here but jurisdictionally speaking, we are on Stark property. That is my name on the glass... 
ALEXANDER PIERCE
Just give me the case.
Across the lobby, TONY OBSERVES FROM BEHIND HIS SWAT HELMET.
73
TONY (INTO COM)
Move it, Stuart Little. Things are getting dicey out here.
INTERCUT:
INT. TONY STARK’S RT - DAY (AVENGERS 1)
Scott studies A TANGLE OF COPPER WIRING.
SCOTT LANG (INTO COM)
This place is a mess.
(finding a wire)
You promise you won’t die?
TONY (OVER COM)
You’re only giving me a minor
cardiac dysrhythmia-
SCOTT LANG
That doesn’t actually sound minor-
Tony sees PIERCE reaching for A1 TONY’S CASE.
TONY
Window’s closing.	Pull my plug.
SCOTT LANG
Here goes... 
SCOTT YANKS THE WIRE OUT OF ITS SOCKET.
IN THE LOBBY, A1 TONY GRIPS HIS CHEST.
ALEXANDER PIERCE
Stark?
A1 Tony SEIZES, dropping. THE TESSERACT CASE CLATTERS TO THE GROUND. PIERCE and A1 THOR kneel to assist.
ALEXANDER PIERCE (CONT'D)
MEDIC!
A1 THOR
Stark? Somebody get some help! Is it your chest machine?
THE LOBBY BUZZES, SHIELD AGENTS RUNNING EVERYWHERE.
In the bustle, SCOTT SLIDES OUT OF A1 TONY’S SLEEVE. He SHOVES THE TESSERACT CASE HARD. It SPINS across the floor... 
RIGHT INTO TONY’S HAND.	Tony walks toward a side door.
74
TONY (INTO COM)
Meet me in the alley. I’m just gonna grab a slice at Famous Ray’s-
BUT AS TONY PASSES THE STAIRWELL DOOR... HULK BANGS IT OPEN, SMASHING TONY IN THE FACE, SENDING HIM TUMBLING.
A1 HULK BASHES HIS WAY THROUGH THE LOBBY.
The Tesseract Case hits the floor, popping open. THE TESSERACT FALLS OUT, spinning past Tiny Scott... 
STOPPING AT LOKI’S FEET. Loki stares at it in disbelief. He glances at A1 Thor and Pierce giving A1 Tony first aid.
THEN LOKI CALMLY REACHES DOWN WITH HIS MANACLED HANDS, GRASPS THE TESSERACT... AND TELEPORTS AWAY. Scott stares, stunned.
SCOTT LANG
That wasn’t supposed to happen, was it?
A1 THOR LOOKS UP, REALIZING... 
A1 THOR
WHERE’S LOKI?
SHIELD TEAMS FAN OUT, ON ALERT.
INT. STARK TOWER, 14TH FLOOR - DAY (AVENGERS 1)
STEVE heads down a hall, SCEPTER IN HAND.
SECURITY (OVER SPEAKER)
Building-wide alert, all units.
Target Loki, maximum force.
STEVE (INTO COM)
Tony?	What’s going on?	Tell me
you got that cube-
A1 STEVE (O.S.)
Strike Teams, clear Forty, then
work down.
Before Steve can hide... A1 STEVE ROUNDS THE CORNER.
STEVE
Oh, great.
A1 STEVE (INTO COM)
Disregard.	I have eyes on Loki,
Fourteenth Floor.
75
STEVE GENTLY LAYS THE SCEPTER DOWN, AND PULLS OFF HIS SHIELD.
STEVE
I’m not Loki. And I don’t want to hurt you.
A1 STEVE PULLS HIS SHIELD OFF HIS BACK.
A1 STEVE
You’re not going to get the chance-
A1 STEVE KICKS STEVE IN THE FACE.	Steve stumbles.
STEVE
Forgot about that one.
They grapple.	Both their shields fall to the ground... 
THEY BOTH STAMP ON THEM, simultaneously flipping the shields back to their arms. A1 Steve looks impressed.
A1 STEVE SWINGS. STEVE DUCKS, HAMMERING HIM. A1 Steve wipes the blood from his lip, squaring off.
A1 STEVE
I can do this all day-
STEVE
Yeah, I know... 
They battle on. A1 Steve tackles Steve, knocking his shield aside, RIPPING OPEN ONE OF STEVE’S BELT COMPARTMENTS:
THE COMPASS FALLS OUT, OPENING TO REVEAL PEGGY’S PICTURE. A1 Steve goes cold. He picks up the compass, FLABBERGASTED.
A1 STEVE
Where’d you get this?
STEVE
PX.	Camp Lehigh.	1943.
A1 Steve stares at Steve, eyes narrowing.
A1 STEVE
You’ve got a lot of nerve.
HE HAMMERS STEVE ACROSS THE HALL. Steve goes skidding. He groans, looking up to see... HE’S INCHES FROM THE SCEPTER.
A1 STEVE moves in. STEVE whips around, touching THE SCEPTER to A1 Steve’s chest. A1 STEVE’S EYES GO BLACK. HE FREEZES.
76
Steve stares, panting. Finally, he picks up the compass from the floor, then considers A1 STEVE’S ASS.
STEVE
That is America’s ass.
EXT. SANCTUM SANCTORUM, ROOF - DAY (AVENGERS 1)
SMART HULK’S BODY lies slumped on an Adirondack chair, a floppy sun hat covering his face.
ANCIENT ONE (O.S.)
I wish I could help you, Bruce... 
THE ANCIENT ONE waters a rooftop garden. She looks to ASTRAL BANNER, who’s only just getting used to being see-through.
ANCIENT ONE (CONT'D) But if I were to give up the Time Stone to help your reality, I’d be dooming my own.
ASTRAL BANNER
Yeah, with all due respect, I’m not sure the science supports that.
ANCIENT ONE
And yet, you’re the one currently
standing in the middle of my
hydrangeas.
Banner looks down to see, indeed, he has phased through the middle of the hydrangeas. He steps out of it.
ASTRAL BANNER
Lady, I just want to borrow your
necklace-
ANCIENT ONE
At what cost?
SHE CONJURES A MAGICAL PROJECTION OF THE INFINITY STONES, SPINNING IN UNISON. A TUNNEL OF GOLDEN LIGHT POURS FORTH.
ANCIENT ONE (CONT'D) The Infinity Stones create the experience you know as the flow of time. Remove one of the stones, and the flow splits.
She plucks the GREEN TIME STONE out of the array: A SMALLER, BLACKENED RIVER BRANCHES OFF FROM THE FIRST.
77
ANCIENT ONE (CONT'D) Now, your timeline might benefit. My new one... would definitely not.
SHE GESTURES.	OUR CAMERA ZOOMS INTO THE BLACKENED TUNNEL... 
TUNNEL POV: HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE RUN AS WE FLY OVER A CROWDED STREET, UP TO... THE BURNING HONG KONG SANCTUM.
ANCIENT ONE (O.S.) (CONT'D) In this new branch reality, without our chief weapon against the forces of darkness, our world would be overrun... 
MOVE UP TO SEE DORMAMMU IN THE SKY.	HE OPENS HIS MOUTH... 
BACK ON THE ROOF... THE ANCIENT ONE PLUCKS MORE STONES FROM THE GOLDEN RIVER, CREATING FIVE MORE BLACKENED TRIBUTARIES.
ANCIENT ONE (CONT'D) For each stone you remove, you’ll create a new, vulnerable timeline. Millions will suffer.
(beat)
Now tell me, Doctor.	Can your
science prevent all that?
ASTRAL BANNER
No.	But it can erase it.
Astral Banner reaches in and grabs THE VIRTUAL TIME STONE.
ASTRAL BANNER (CONT'D) Because once we’re done with the stones, we can return each one to its own timeline. At the moment it was taken. So chronologically, in that reality, the stone never left.
HE PUTS THE TIME STONE BACK.	THE BLACK TIMELINE DISAPPEARS.
ANCIENT ONE
You’re leaving out the most
important part, though.	In order
to put the stones back, you’d have
to survive.
ASTRAL BANNER
We will.	I will.	I promise.
ANCIENT ONE
I can’t risk this reality on a
promise.
(MORE)
78
ANCIENT ONE (CONT'D) It is the duty of the Sorcerer Supreme to protect the Time Stone-
ASTRAL BANNER
Yeah?	Then why the hell did
Strange give it away?
The Ancient One freezes.
ANCIENT ONE
What did you say?
ASTRAL BANNER
Strange gave Thanos the Time Stone.
ANCIENT ONE
Willingly?	Why?
ASTRAL BANNER
Don’t know.	Maybe he made a
mistake.
ANCIENT ONE
Or I did.
The Ancient One looks out over a recovering NYC.
ANCIENT ONE (CONT'D) Strange is meant to be the best of us.
ASTRAL BANNER
Then he must have had a reason.
ANCIENT ONE
I fear you may be right... 
Finally, she waves her hand and... WHOOSH! HE REINTEGRATES INTO THE SMART HULK BODY. Smart Hulk gets up, WOOZY.
SHE REMOVES THE TIME STONE FROM THE EYE, HANDING IT TO HIM.
SMART HULK
Thank you.
ANCIENT ONE
I’m counting on you, Bruce.
(re. the city behind her)
We all are.
EXT. SANCTUARY 2 - DAY
THE SANCTUARY-2 LOOMS.
79
INT. SANCTUARY 2 - DAY
BAD NEBULA HANGS SUSPENDED. CABLES travel from her “brain” to a GLOWING WALL OF DATABANKS, which silhouettes... 
THANOS.	He regards her for a moment.	Then... 
THANOS
Run diagnostics.	Show me her
memory file.
At the console, EBONY MAW SCANS NEBULA’S INFORMATION.
NEBULA’S BODY TWITCHES.
GAMORA WATCHES, TORN.	SOON... AN ALERT FLASHES.
EBONY MAW
Sir, the file appears... entangled.
It was a memory, but not hers.
(dawning on him)
There’s another consciousness
sharing her network.	Another
Nebula.
THANOS
Impossible.
EBONY MAW
This duplicate carries a time
stamp... from nine years in the
future.
THANOS
Where is this “other Nebula?”
EBONY MAW
In our solar system.	On Morag.
THANOS
Can you access her?
EBONY MAW
Yes.	The two are linked.
THANOS PEERS INTO BAD NEBULA’S GLASSY EYES... 
THANOS
Search the duplicate’s memory for
Infinity Stones.
Maw works the console. Thanos steps aside as BAD NEBULA’S BODY QUIVERS. AFTER A BEAT, A BEAM SHOOTS OUT OF HER EYE... 
PROJECTING AN IMAGE OF AVENGERS COMPOUND:
80
STEVE, TONY, RHODEY, SCOTT, SMART HULK, ROCKET, NATASHA, CLINT, AND THOR GATHER IN THE LIVING AREA.
SMART HULK (HOLO)
-the Stones have been in a lot of
places throughout history.
TONY (HOLO)
Our history.	Not all of them are
going to be a fun drop-in.
CLINT BARTON (HOLO)
Which means we’ve got to pick our
targets.
STEVE (HOLO)
Exactly.	Let’s start here-
THANOS
Freeze image.
THE IMAGE FREEZES.	THANOS STARES, RECOGNIZING THEM.
GAMORA
Terrans?
THANOS
Avengers.	Unruly wretches.
He gestures to A BLURRY REFLECTION WITHIN THE HOLOGRAM.
THANOS (CONT'D)
What’s this reflection.	Amplify
this, Maw.
EBONY MAW ZOOMS IN, REVEALING... A REFLECTION OF NEBULA.
GAMORA
I don’t understand.	Two Nebulas?
Thanos walks into the hologram, studying the faces.
THANOS
No.	The same Nebula.	From two
different times.
(to Ebony Maw)
Set course for Morag. And scan the duplicate’s memories.
(beat)
I want to see everything... 
81
INT. ASGARD, PALACE, CORRIDOR - DAY (THOR 2)
Frigga walks down a corridor, alone. THOR SNEAKS FROM COLUMN TO COLUMN, FOLLOWING HER. She PAUSES, sensing something.
Thor HIDES. When he peers again, FRIGGA IS GONE. Then he turns around to find FRIGGA STANDING BESIDE HIM. Thor jumps.
FRIGGA
What are you doing?
THOR
Mother!	What?	Nothing.	Hello.
FRIGGA
You’re better off leaving the
sneaking to your brother.
(re. his bathrobe)
What are you wearing?
THOR
I always wear this. It’s one of my favorites.
FRIGGA
And what’s wrong with your eye?
THOR
Oh, that.	You remember
the... Battle of Harokin.	I took
a... broadsword to the face?
He trails off, at a loss, staring at his dead mom. Frigga gently lays her hand on his cheek... READING HIM.
FRIGGA
Oh. You’re not the Thor I know at all, are you?
THOR
Yes, I am-
FRIGGA
I was raised by witches, boy.	I
see with more than eyes, you know
that.
(eyeing him)
I can see the future hasn’t been
kind to you, has it?
THOR
I didn’t say I was from the
future... 
82
FRIGGA
Thor... 
Frigga gives her son a stern, “don’t lie to me” look. Thor stares at his mom a long moment. Then, he cracks:
THOR
I’m totally from the future.
FRIGGA
Yes, you are.
THOR
I need to talk to you.
FRIGGA
We can talk.
Frigga GRABS Thor by the cloak and yanks him away.
INT. ASGARD, PALACE, JANE FOSTER’S CHAMBER - DAY (THOR 2)
CLOSE ON A PAIR OF MODERN BOOTS BENEATH AN ASGARDIAN GOWN.
TILT UP TO FIND... JANE FOSTER.	She studies the outfit.
Behind her, ROCKET RAISES THE EXTRACTION DEVICE OVER HIS HEAD, ABOUT TO JAB... 
INT. ASGARD, PALACE, FRIGGA’S CHAMBER - DAY (THOR 2)
FRIGGA sits with THOR in her chambers.
THOR
... and then it was done. His head over there. Body over there. And me in the middle. Just an idiot with an axe.
FRIGGA
You’re no idiot.	You’re here,
aren’t you?	Seeking counsel from
the smartest person in Asgard?
THOR
Yeah, I guess.
FRIGGA
An idiot, no.	A failure,
absolutely.
83
THOR
That’s a little harsh-
FRIGGA
Quite a colossal one, by the sound of it.
THOR
Okay, maybe just stop talking.
FRIGGA
And you know what that makes you?
Just like everyone else.
THOR
I’m not supposed to be like
everyone else, though.
FRIGGA
Everyone fails at “who they’re supposed to be,” Thor. The measure of a person, of a hero, is how well they succeed at being who they are.
Thor stares at her, biting back emotions.
THOR
I’ve really missed you, Mum.
INT. ASGARD, PALACE, CORRIDOR - DAY (THOR 2)
ROCKET TEARS DOWN THE HALL, EXTRACTION DEVICE IN HAND.
ROCKET
I got it I got it I got it!
A TROOP OF EINHERJAR CHASE AFTER HIM.
INT. ASGARD, PALACE, FRIGGA’S CHAMBER - DAY (THOR 2)
THOR looks at THE OBSERVATORY: Dark Elves will soon attack.
THOR
Mum, I have to tell you something-
FRIGGA
No, son.	You don’t.	You’ve come
to repair your future, not mine.
THOR
But your future-
84
FRIGGA
Is none of my business.
Thor stares at her, torn.	THEN ROCKET RACES INTO THE ROOM.
ROCKET
(to Frigga)
Hi.	You must be Mom.
(to Thor, re. the device)
I got the thing. Come on, we gotta move-
Thor looks to Frigga.
THOR
I wish we had more time-
FRIGGA
This was a gift.	Now, go be the
man you’re meant to be.
(beat)
And eat a salad.
Thor smiles.	He and Rocket activate their time suits.
ROCKET
Three... two-
THOR
No.	Wait.
THOR DRAMATICALLY HOLDS OUT HIS HAND.	A long moment passes.
ROCKET
What am I looking at?
FRIGGA
Sometimes it takes a second.
Then... MJOLNIR SAILS INTO HER SON’S HAND.	She grins, proud.
THOR
(relieved)
Still worthy.
Mother and son look at each other for the last time.
THOR (CONT'D)
Goodbye, Mum.
FRIGGA
Goodbye, Son.
THEN, WHOOSH!	THOR AND ROCKET DISAPPEAR.
85
Suddenly... THE PALACE RUMBLES. Frigga looks to the window, WHERE A DARK ELF WARSHIP DECLOAKS. SHE REACHES FOR A SWORD.
PRELAP: “COME AND GET YOUR LOVE,” BY REDBONE.
EXT. MORAG, ABANDONED CITY - DAY (GUARDIANS)
PETER QUILL, in RED, PLEATHER TRENCH COAT AND HEADPHONES, dances through the ruins of an alien city.
PULL BACK TO... NEBULA AND RHODEY WATCHING FROM BEHIND A ROCK.
RHODEY
So, he’s an idiot.
NEBULA
Yes.
Quill spins, arms out, eyes shut. When the horizon finally settles... he sees A METAL MAN STANDING THERE WAITING FOR HIM.
QUILL
Oh, fu-
BAM!	RHODEY DECKS QUILL IN THE FACE.	Quill drops, out cold.
RHODEY
Sorry about that. I know you guys were teammates and everything.
NEBULA
Do you hear me complaining?
Nebula rifles through Quill’s sack. She pulls out AN ELECTRONIC LOCK PICK.
RHODEY
What is that?
NEBULA
The tool of a thief.	Come on.
They set out toward the RUINED CITY.
INT. MORAG, TEMPLE VAULT - DAY (GUARDIANS)
WHIR, CLICK. TWO HUGE, STONE DOORS SLIDE OPEN, REVEALING NEBULA AND RHODEY. SHE STEPS IN. RHODEY TRIES TO STOP HER.
86
RHODEY
Hang on. This would be about the time the spikes come out, you know, with the skeletons still on them?
NEBULA
What are you talking about?
RHODEY
I’m just saying, when you break into a place called, “The Temple of the Power Stone”, there are usually... 
Ahead, they see... THE POWER STONE ORB HOVERING ABOVE ITS PEDESTAL, SURROUNDED BY A WEB OF LASER THREADS.
RHODEY (CONT'D)
Traps and stuff.
(Nebula steps inside)
Okay, don’t say I didn’t warn you.
Rhodey scans the laser web, strategizing.
RHODEY (CONT'D)
These are photovoltaic lasers on a constantly shifting matrix. Gonna be damn near impossible to neutralize unless we-
SUDDENLY, NEBULA REACHES HER CYBERNETIC ARM THROUGH THE WEB.
SHE GRABS THE ORB... BUT THE WEB GRIPS HER, FRYING HER ARM.
She pulls out the orb, but sees Rhodey staring at HER BLACKENED CLAW.
NEBULA
I wasn’t always like this.
He sees actual emotion somewhere inside her. Favor his exoskeletal leg braces as he softens.
RHODEY
Yeah, me either. I guess we do the best with what we’ve got, huh?
SHE HANDS HIM THE ORB WITH JUST THE GHOST OF A SMILE.
RHODEY (CONT'D)
Let’s get out of here.	Place gives
me the creeps.	Sync up.	Three... 
two... one... 
87
RHODEY TAPS HIS CUFF, SHRINKING AWAY. Nebula goes for hers... BUT HER EYES ROLL BACK.
SHE COLLAPSES, SEIZING VIOLENTLY, THEN GOING STILL. Her eyes snap open, projecting a hologram of... THANOS.
THANOS (HOLO)
What’s wrong?
INT. SANCTUARY-2, INTERROGATION CELL - DAY
BACK IN THE INTERROGATION CELL, BAD NEBULA’S EYE BEAMS: IN THANOS’ LODGE, THE AVENGERS SURROUND A ONE-ARMED THANOS.
THANOS STUDIES HIS HOLO-FUTURE-SELF, WATCHING HIS DESTINY PLAY OUT IN FRONT OF HIM.
BRUCE BANNER (HOLO)
You murdered trillions.
THANOS (HOLO)
You should be grateful.
NATASHA (HOLO)
Where are the stones?
THANOS SMIRKS, PUTTING THE PIECES TOGETHER.
THANOS (HOLO)
Gone.	Reduced to atoms.
BRUCE BANNER (HOLO)
You used them two days ago!
THANOS (HOLO)
I used the stones to destroy the
stones.	The work is done.	It
always will be... 
HE STEPS FORWARD, FINISHING HIS OWN THOUGHT.
THANOS (HOLO) (CONT'D) I AM INEVITABLE-
THANOS (CONT'D) I AM INEVITABLE.
Thanos nods to Maw, who freezes the program. THANOS WALKS THROUGH THE HOLOGRAM, STUDYING THE HEROES.
GAMORA
What did you do to them?
THANOS
Nothing.	Yet.
(piecing it together)
(MORE)
88
THANOS (CONT'D)
They’re not trying to stop
something I’m going to do in our
time.	They’re trying to undo
something I’ve already done in
theirs.
GAMORA
(uneasy)
The stones.
THANOS
I found them all.	I won.	Tipped
the cosmic scales to balance.
EBONY MAW
Sire.	This is your future?
THANOS
My destiny.
He stares, mind whirling.	He nods.	THE MEMORY RESUMES.
RHODEY (HOLO)
He’s lying.
NEBULA (O.S.)
My father is many things.	A liar
is not one of them.
THANOS (HOLO)
Thank you, daughter. Perhaps I’ve treated you too-
WHUMP. THOR CUTS OFF THANOS’ HEAD. THE VIEW LINGERS AS “NEBULA” STARES AT HER DEAD FATHER.
THANOS STUDIES HIS SEVERED HEAD... AND SMILES.
THANOS (CONT'D)
And that is destiny fulfilled.
Gamora stares, torn.	But Ebony Maw fumes on Thanos’ behalf.
EBONY MAW
Sire.	Your daughter is a traitor.
EBONY MAW GESTURES: CABLES WRAP AROUND NEBULA’S NECK. SHE AWAKENS, PANICKED. She looks up at Thanos.
BAD NEBULA
(choking)
No.	Please, father.	That’s not
me.	I would never betray you.
Please-
89
Thanos UNWRAPS the cord.	He touches his daughter’s face.
THANOS
Ssh, child.	I know.	And you’ll
have the chance to prove it... 
INT. MORAG, TEMPLE VAULT - DAY (GUARDIANS)
ZZZT.	ON THE FLOOR, NEBULA’S EYES SNAP OPEN, HORRIFIED.
NEBULA
He knows... 
EXT. MORAG - DAY (GUARDIANS)
BOOTS POUND ACROSS THE ROCKS. NEBULA RUNS FLAT OUT, DESPERATE, HEADING FOR THE ESCAPE POD.
INT. ESCAPE POD - DAY (GUARDIANS)
NEBULA rushes to the console and opens A COMMUNICATION LINK.
NEBULA (INTO COM)
Barton, Romanoff, come in.	We have
a problem.	Thanos knows!	Thanos-
Suddenly, A SHADOW falls over the Pod. Nebula looks out the cockpit window... 
AS A TRACTOR BEAM PULLS THE ENTIRE POD SKYWARD.
EXT. NEW YORK CITY, ALLEY - (AVENGERS 1)
IN THE ALLEY, Steve drops down from the building. He hears A WHISTLE. TONY waves from behind a crashed car.
TONY
We’ve got a problem.
TIME CUT:
STEVE huddles with TONY and SCOTT.
STEVE
How could you lose it?
TONY
What do you want? I got hit in the head with a Hulk!
90
SCOTT LANG
You said we only had one shot. This was our shot. We shot it. It was six stones or nothing! Six stones-
TONY
You’re not helping-
SCOTT LANG
You ruined the Time Heist!
TONY
Okay, okay, Loki’s from Asgard, he’s comfortable there. Knows the restaurants. It’s a safe bet he visits home. If we can just grab This-Thor and explain the situation, he and I can fly-
STEVE
Loki could be anywhere in the
universe.	We’d be old men before
we found him.
As Steve and Scott debate, MOVE IN ON TONY, MIND WHIRLING... 
STEVE (CONT'D)
What other options did we have on
the Tesseract?
SCOTT LANG
Whoa, whoa. We don’t have any other options. We can’t go to any other times. No do-overs! We’ve only got one particle left, each. Use it now, that’s it, bye-bye, we don’t come home.
STEVE
But if we don’t try, nobody else
comes home, either.
TONY
I got it! There’s another way to re-take the Tesseract, and acquire new particles.
(to Steve)
Military installation, Garden
State.
Steve eyes Tony, BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND.
91
STEVE
When were they both there?
TONY
I have a vaguely exact idea.
STEVE
How vague?
SCOTT LANG
Hang on, what’s in New Jersey?
TONY
I know they were there, and I know how I know.
STEVE STUDIES TONY A LONG MOMENT... 
STEVE
Looks like we’re improvising.
SCOTT LANG
Wait!	What are you improvising?
STEVE HANDS SCOTT THE STAFF.
STEVE
Scott, take this back to the
Compound.
TONY
All right, suits on.	Try these
coordinates. 04-07-19-70... 
SCOTT LANG
Steve- Cap- Captain America, if you do this and he’s wrong... you’re not coming back.
Steve and Tony let the weight of that sink in.	He’s right.
Even so, Tony turns to Steve.
TONY
You trust me?
STEVE
I do.
THEY STARE AT EACH OTHER, THEN... CLICK. THEY BOTH HIT THEIR CUFFS. TONY AND STEVE SHRINK TO NOTHING... 
92
EXT. NEW JERSEY WOODS - DAY (1970)
CUE MUSIC: “HEY LAWDY MAMA,” STEPPENWOLF.
A 1970 Oldsmobile motors down a wooded road. The bumper sticker reads: “NUFF SAID.”
At the wheel, STAN LEE (48), LONG HAIR, MOUSTACHE, OPEN SHIRT, sings along to the radio, TWO LADIES at his side.
He passes by AN ARMY BASE, throwing a peace sign to A GUARD.
STAN LEE
Make love, not war, baby!
He roars off, passing A FADED SIGN: “U.S. ARMY - CAMP LEHIGH - BIRTHPLACE OF CAPTAIN AMERICA.” MOVE INTO THE BASE... 
TONY (O.S.)
You weren’t actually born here,
right?
EXT. CAMP LEHIGH - DAY (1970)
SOLDIERS MARCH PAST AS... 
Tony and Steve round the corner, TONY IN A LAB COAT and STEVE IN GREEN KHAKIS, LOW-PULLED CAP, AND MIRRORED SUNGLASSES.
STEVE
The idea of me was.
TONY
(looking around)
All right.	If I was SHIELD and I
wanted to hide my quasi-fascistic
black site, where would I hide it?
STEVE
In plain sight.
Steve nods at A MAN IN A GRAY SUIT approaching a building, “MUNITIONS.” He opens the door with a retro-tech PUNCH CARD.
TONY TOUCHES HIS GLASSES: HE X-RAYS INTO THE GROUND, ILLUMINATING... TWENTY FLOORS OF SECRET, UNDERGROUND BASE.
INT. CAMP LEHIGH, ELEVATOR - DAY (1970)
Muzak plays as STEVE and TONY ride down with A FEMALE SHIELD AGENT.
93
She stares awkwardly at Tony.	Steve keeps his hat down.
Ding.	The doors open.	Tony exits, then turns back to Steve.
TONY
Good luck with that mission,
Captain.
STEVE
Good luck with your project,
Doctor.
Tony ducks out.	The doors close.	The Agent turns to Steve.
FEMALE SHIELD AGENT
You new here?
STEVE
Not exactly.
INT. CAMP LEHIGH, SHIELD FACILITY, ARCHIVES - DAY (1970)
TONY searches HIGH, CROWDED ARCHIVE SHELVES.
TONY
Come on, you little hexahedron,
where are you hiding?
Finally, he spots A HIGH TECH SAFE. He grabs a briefcase, then NANOS A GAUNTLET, FRYING THE SAFE’S LOCK.
It opens revealing... THE TESSERACT.	Tony smiles.
TONY (CONT'D)
You may not know it now, but
someday you’re going to be a real
pain-in-the-ass.
Just then... THE ARCHIVE DOOR OPENS.
HOWARD STARK (O.S.)
Hey, Arnim, you in here?
TONY LOCKS THE CUBE IN THE BRIEFCASE JUST BEFORE... 
HOWARD STARK (49) APPEARS, carrying ROSES AND A CAN OF SAUERKRAUT. TONY STARES, STUNNED.
HOWARD STARK (CONT'D) Hey, I’m looking for Dr. Zola. You seen him?
TONY
No.	Haven’t seen a soul.
94
Tony stands in front of his father, overwhelmed. Howard looks at him, a bit suspicious.
HOWARD STARK
I know you?
From his pocket, TONY GENERATES A BADGE OUT OF NANO-TECH.
He holds it out.
TONY
No, sir.	Just visiting from MIT.
HOWARD STARK
That so?	Got a name?
TONY
Howard... 
HOWARD STARK
Easy to remember-
TONY
Potts.
HOWARD STARK
I’m Howard Stark.
(shaking hands)
You seem a little green around the gills, Potts. Need some air?
TONY
That’d be swell.
Tony distractedly walks away, leaving the briefcase.
HOWARD STARK
Need the briefcase?
PRE-LAP A RINGING PHONE... 
INT. CAMP LEHIGH, SHIELD FACILITY, PYM’S LAB - DAY (1970)
CLOSE ON: AN ANT.	A phone continues to ring.	Then... 
HANK PYM (O.S.)
Hello?
PULL BACK: THE ANT CRAWLS IN AN ANTFARM ON A LAB SHELF. STEVE (OVER PHONE)
Dr. Pym?
95
HANK PYM (O.S.)
That would be the number you
called, yes.
PAN across the shelf to A CHART OF WASP MATURATION.
STEVE (OVER PHONE)
This is Captain Stevens, from
shipping.	We have a package for
you.
KEEP PANNING to A PROTOTYPE ANT-MAN HELMET.
HANK PYM (O.S.)
So bring it up.
STEVE (OVER PHONE)
That’s the thing, sir, we can’t.
ARRIVE ON... HANK PYM (20’s), in brown hair and lab coat.
HANK PYM
Maybe I’m confused.	Isn’t that
your job?
STEVE (OVER PHONE)
It’s just... sir, the box is
glowing.	And to be honest, a
couple of our mail guys aren’t
feeling great-
HANK PYM
They didn’t open it, did they?!
INT. CAMP LEHIGH, SHIELD FACILITY, HALLWAY - DAY (1970)
A DOOR MARKED, “DR. HENRY PYM,” flies open. Hank exits, fuming, brushing past... STEVE.
Steve watches Hank stalk off... THEN DUCKS INTO HANK’S LAB.
INT. CAMP LEHIGH, SHIELD FACILITY, ELEVATOR - DAY (1970)
HOWARD and TONY step onto AN ELEVATOR.	The doors shut.
TONY
Sauerkraut and a bouquet... big
night planned?
96
HOWARD STARK
(lifting one at a time)
My wife’s expecting. And too much time at the office.
Tony puzzles the dates out in his head... 
TONY
Congratulations.
HOWARD STARK
Thanks.
TONY
How far along is she?
HOWARD STARK
Gee, I suppose... 
(indicating)
... this far. She’s at the point where she can’t stand the sound of my chewing. So I guess I’ll be eating in the pantry again.
TONY
I have a little girl.
TONY SMILES. He’s talking about the man-he’s-talking-to’s granddaughter, fifty years before she’s born.
HOWARD STARK
A girl would be nice. Less chance she’d turn out exactly like me.
TONY
Would that be so bad?
HOWARD STARK
Let’s just say the greater good
hasn’t always outweighed my own
self interest.
The elevator doors open.
INT. CAMP LEHIGH, SHIELD FACILITY, PYM’S LAB - DAY (1970)
STEVE searches Hank’s lab, finally opening the fridge to find... A TRAY OF BRAND NEW PYM PARTICLES.
97
INT. CAMP LEHIGH, SHIELD FACILITY, HALLWAY - DAY (1970)
Steve exits Hank’s lab and heads for the elevator. But it opens, revealing THE FEMALE AGENT FROM EARLIER, WITH AN M.P.
M.P.
You’ve never seen either of these
men before?
FEMALE SHIELD AGENT
No.	But I have an eye for this.
Something looked fishy.
M.P.
Describe ‘fishy’.
FEMALE SHIELD AGENT
One of them had a hippie beard.
M.P.
We talking Bee Gees or Mungo Jerry?
FEMALE SHIELD AGENT
Definitely Mungo Jerry.
M.P.
(over walkie-talkie)
This is Chesler. We need every available agent to sub-level 6. We have a potential breach.
Steve ducks through the nearest door... 
INT. CAMP LEHIGH, SHIELD FACILITY, PEGGY’S OFC. - DAY (1970)
Steve enters a darkened office. A glass wall separates it from another bullpen.
Then he sees something on the desk. He stares, stunned, at two photos: one features PEGGY CARTER STANDING WITH JFK.
THE OTHER IS OF SKINNY STEVE.
Steve turns the desk nameplate around: “MARGARET CARTER.”
Steve realizes that even twenty-five years later, Peggy never forgot about him.
Just then, THE BULLPEN DOOR FLIES OPEN. LIGHTS SNAP ON, revealing PEGGY CARTER (49), talking to someone in the hall.
PEGGY CARTER
So, send them in.
98
MALE AGENT
They’re trying, ma’am, but
Braddock’s unit has been stopped by
lightning strikes.
PEGGY CARTER
Oh, for the love of- I’ll find the weather projections. You call Braddock and tell him to shelter in place. Assuming he’s bright enough to come out of the rain.
MALE AGENT (O.S.)
Yes, ma’am.
Steve stares at her from the darkness, STUNNED.
Peggy rifles through a file cabinet.
PEGGY CARTER
Here we are... 
She flips through a file, reading. In the darkness behind her, Steve approaches. Peggy reads something disturbing.
PEGGY CARTER (CONT'D)
Crikey O’Reilly.
(calling out)
Sergeant?	Hang up and call Air
Command.	Braddock needs back up,
immediately.
MALE AGENT
Ma’am?
PEGGY CARTER
Those aren’t lightning strikes he’s looking at... 
She slaps the file closed and hurries out.
Steve stares after her a long moment.
EXT. CAMP LEHIGH - DAY (1970)
Howard and Tony approach a WAITING LIMO.
TONY
Got any names, yet?
HOWARD STARK
If it’s a boy, my wife likes
Elmonzo.
99
TONY
You might let that stew a while.
You’ve got time.
HOWARD STARK
What are you, couple years older
than me?
TONY
Yeah.	I guess.
HOWARD STARK
Let me ask you a question.	When
your kid was born... were you
nervous?
TONY
Wildly.
HOWARD STARK
Did you feel qualified?	Like you
had any idea how to successfully
operate that thing?
TONY
I pieced it together as I went along. I thought about what my dad did... 
HOWARD STARK
My old man never met a problem he
couldn’t solve with a belt.
TONY
I tried to hold onto the good stuff. Dad dropped the odd pearl, here and there.
HOWARD STARK
Like what?
TONY
“No amount of money ever bought a
second of time.”
HOWARD STARK
That’s good.	Smart guy.
TONY
He did his best.
100
HOWARD STARK
I tell you, this kid’s not even
here yet, but there’s nothing I
wouldn’t do for him.
Tony takes this in, GRATIFIED. Just then... EDWIN JARVIS (56) opens the limo door.
HOWARD STARK (CONT'D) Besides, if I fall down on the fathering job, old Jarvis is ready to pick up the slack. Isn’t that right?
EDWIN JARVIS
Indeed, sir.	I shall endeavor to
teach the lad the rudiments of
judo.
Tony smiles at his old friend. As Jarvis gets in the car, Tony notices... STEVE WAITING BEHIND A JEEP. TIME TO GO.
Howard turns to shake Tony’s hand.
HOWARD STARK
Well, good to meet you, Potts.
TONY
You’re going to do fine, Howard.
HOWARD STARK
Thanks.	See you around?
TONY
Count on it... 
As he gets into his car, Howard looks to Jarvis.
HOWARD STARK
Have we met him before?
EDWIN JARVIS
We’ve met a lot of people, sir.
HOWARD STARK
Seems very familiar.
(beat)
Weird beard.
EXT. SANCTUARY 2 - SPACE
The Sanctuary-2 cruises ominously through space.
101
INT. SANCTUARY-2, PRISON CELL - DAY
WHACK! NEBULA GOES TUMBLING ACROSS THE FLOOR. She gets to her knees, looking up at... BAD NEBULA, GLARING DOWN AT HER.
BAD NEBULA
You’re weak.
NEBULA
I’m you-
BAD NEBULA
Shut up!
BAD NEBULA PUNCHES GOOD NEBULA DOWN. GOOD NEBULA GROANS AS BAD NEBULA RIPS OFF HER TIME-SPACE GPS.
THEN GAMORA ENTERS. Nebula softens, taking in her (once dead) sister.
NEBULA
You could stop this. You know you want to.
(off Gamora’s look)
Did you see what happens in the
future?	Thanos finds the Soul
Stone.
MOVE IN ON GAMORA, WHEELS TURNING... 
NEBULA (CONT'D)
You want to know how he does that? You want to know what he does to you-
BAD NEBULA
ENOUGH!
BAD NEBULA SMACKS HER THE HARDEST YET, THEN LEANS IN WITH A JAGGED INSTRUMENT OF TORTURE.
BAD NEBULA (CONT'D)
You disgust me... but that doesn’t
mean you’re useless.
SHE PRIES OFF THE ORANGE PANEL FROM GOOD NEBULA’S HEAD.
Gamora takes in this new development... 
INT. SANCTUARY-2, THRONE ROOM - DAY
Bad Nebula enters to find Thanos on his throne. She hands him Good Nebula’s TIME-SPACE GPS. He smiles.
102
Bad Nebula affixes Good Nebula’s orange panel onto her head.
BAD NEBULA
How do I look?
EXT. BENATAR - SPACE
THE BENATAR approaches Vormir.
TITLE: VORMIR, 2014
INT. BENATAR, FLIGHT DECK - SPACE
NATASHA and CLINT stand on the flight deck, staring at THE MAJESTIC, PURPLE PLANET.
CLINT BARTON
Under different circumstances, this would be totally awesome.
EXT. VORMIR - DAY
Clint and Natasha eye THE BENATAR resting on a sand dune.
Clint fires a Pym Particle.
WHOOSH, THE ENTIRE SHIP DISAPPEARS. CLINT lifts THE SHRUNKEN BENATAR and tucks it in his pocket.
CLINT AND NATASHA TREK ACROSS THE DUNES OF VORMIR, TOWARD... THE MOUNTAIN.
EXT. VORMIR, MIDWAY UP THE MOUNTAIN - DAY
Natasha and Clint climb, ragged.	They approach AN ARCHWAY.
CLINT BARTON
Really starting to regret my choice here.
NATASHA
Yeah.	I’m gonna bet the raccoon
didn’t have to climb a mountain.
CLINT BARTON
I don’t think technically he’s a
raccoon... 
NATASHA
Whatever.	He eats garbage-
103
THEY HEAR SOMETHING. THEY WHIRL, WEAPONS UP. A HOODED FIGURE APPROACHES.
HOODED FIGURE
I assure you, you have nothing to
fear from me.
CLINT BARTON
Creepy.
HOODED FIGURE
Welcome Natasha, daughter of Ivan.
Clint, son of Edith.
CLINT BARTON
Creepier.
NATASHA
Who are you?
RED SKULL
Consider me a guide.	To you, and
to all who seek the Soul Stone.
NATASHA
Great.	You show us where it is,
and we’ll be on our way.
The figure removes his hood, revealing... THE RED SKULL.
RED SKULL
Oh, liebchen. If only it were that easy... 
EXT. VORMIR, MOUNTAIN TOP - DAY
START ON JAGGED ROCKS. TILT UP TO SEE SKULL, NATASHA, and CLINT staring down from the ALTAR.
RED SKULL
What you seek lies in front of you.
As does what you fear.
NATASHA
The Stone is down there?
RED SKULL
For one of you.	For the other... 
(smiling it away)
The Stone demands a sacrifice. In order to take it, you must leave behind that which you love.
104
SKULL POINTS A BONY FINGER DOWN THE WELL.
RED SKULL (CONT'D)
A soul for a soul.
Natasha and Clint stare down the well, stunned.
TIME CUT:
RED SKULL STARES DOWN THE WELL, robes whipping in the wind.
CLINT BARTON (O.S.)
Maybe he’s full of shit.
FIFTY FEET AWAY, AT THE MONOLITHS, NATASHA AND CLINT HUDDLE.
NATASHA
I don’t think so.
CLINT BARTON
Why, because he knew your daddy’s
name?
NATASHA
I	didn’t.
(off his look)
Thanos left here with the stone, and without his daughter. You really think that’s a coincidence?
They both look out at the well, heavy.
NATASHA (CONT'D)
(under her breath)
Whatever it takes... 
CLINT BARTON
(under his breath)
Whatever it takes... 
Natasha goes to Clint, resolved.
NATASHA
If we don’t get the stone, billions of people are going to stay dead.
CLINT BARTON
Then I guess we both know who it
has to be.
NATASHA
Yeah.	Guess we do.
They take each other’s hand.	A long goodbye beat.	Except... 
105
CLINT BARTON
I’m starting to think we don’t mean the same person.
NATASHA
For the last five years, I’ve been trying to do one thing -- get to right here. This is all it’s been about. Bringing everybody back.
CLINT BARTON
Do not get all decent on me-
NATASHA
You think I want to do it? I’m trying to save your life, you idiot-
CLINT BARTON
And I don’t want you to.
(beat)
Nat.	You know what I’ve done.
What I am now.	Your life’s worth
ten of mine-
NATASHA
I don’t judge people by their worst mistakes-
CLINT BARTON
Maybe you should-
NATASHA
You didn’t.
That stops him.	He looks in her eyes, then down, giving in.
CLINT BARTON
You’re a pain in my ass, you know
that?
She relaxes for the briefest moment. Just then, CLINT SWEEPS OUT HER LEGS, PINNING HER DOWN.
CLINT BARTON (CONT'D)
Tell my family I love them.
SHE REVERSES, SENDING HIM TUMBLING.
NATASHA
Tell them yourself.
SHE FIRES A WIDOW’S BITE INTO HIS CHEST AND MAKES A BREAK FOR THE CLIFF. SHE’S HALFWAY THERE WHEN... 
106
BOOM!	AN EXPLODING ARROW KNOCKS HER OFF HER FEET.
Clint races past her... leaping off edge of the cliff. Just as he falls... 
NATASHA TACKLES HIM IN MID-AIR. They drop, but NATASHA SHOOTS HER GRAPPLING LINE INTO THE CLIFF.
THEY SLAM INTO THE CLIFFSIDE. She attaches the other end of her grappling line to Clint’s belt... saving his life.
She slides, but he reaches out and grabs her... saving hers.
CLINT BARTON
Damn you.
They hang there a long, terrible moment. CLINT’S GRASP STARTS TO LOOSEN. Finally, she looks him in the eye.
NATASHA
Let me go.
CLINT BARTON
No.	Please no... 
The two friends stare at each other, a lifetime between them.
NATASHA
It’s okay... 
CLINT BARTON
Natasha, no-
Then Natasha Romanoff kicks off the cliff wall, yanking out of Clint’s grasp.
She falls... 
Clint dangles from the grappling hook, staring down, helpless, stifling his scream.
WHOOSH!	THE WHOLE WORLD GOES WHITE.
