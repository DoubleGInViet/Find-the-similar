EXT. VORMIR, BOTTOM OF THE MOUNTAIN - DAY
When the light fades, CLINT LIES FLOATING IN SPACE. The camera rotates until we see... IT’S A REFLECTION OF THE SKY.
CLINT LIES IN THE POOL AT THE BASE OF THE MOUNTAIN. He sits up and opens his hand to see THE SOUL STONE. His eyes well.
107
INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, HANGAR - DAY
THE PENCIL FINALLY CLATTERS TO A STOP AS...  WHOOSH, CLINT GROWS INTO THE PRESENT ALONGSIDE THE OTHERS:
SMART HULK HOLDS THE EYE OF AGAMOTTO, SCOTT HAS THE SCEPTER, RHODEY THE ORB, ROCKET & THOR THE EXTRACTION DEVICE, AND TONY
&	STEVE THE TESSERACT. NEBULA RETRACTS HER TIME SUIT. Everyone looks around, exhausted. Amazed.
RHODEY
Are you telling me that actually
worked?
SMART HULK
Did we get them all?
CLINT DROPS TO HIS KNEES.	Steve turns, concerned.
STEVE
Clint?	Are you okay?
Clint stares, haunted.	SMART HULK realizes... 
SMART HULK
Where’s Nat?
(everyone stares)
WHERE’S NAT?!
Clint looks up at them, eyes glassy.
EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, RIVER - DAWN
SMART HULK, eyes red, stands beside a bench on the dock.
Behind him, STEVE, TONY, THOR, AND CLINT STARE OUT, GRIEVING.
TONY
Do we know if she had family?
STEVE
Yeah.	Us.
Thor turns, thrown.
THOR
Why are you doing that?
TONY
I’m just asking a question-
108
THOR
Why are we talking as if she’s
dead?	We have the stones.	Bring
her back.	C’mon, stop this shit.
Clint squeezes away tears.
CLINT BARTON
We can’t get her back.
THOR
What’s he talking about?	Of
course, we can.
CLINT BARTON
It can’t be undone.	That’s why.
THOR
No offense, but you’re... a very earthly being. We’re talking about space magic, here. “Can’t” seems a little definitive, don’t you think?
CLINT BARTON
Well, I know I’m a little outside
my pay grade here, but, she still
isn’t here, is she?
THOR
That’s my point-
CLINT BARTON
It can’t be undone. At least that’s what the red, floating guy said. But why don’t you go talk to him, okay? Why don’t you grab your hammer and fly to that place and talk to him. IT CAN’T BE UNDONE.
(beat)
It was supposed to be me. She sacrificed her life for that goddamn stone. She bet her life on it.
That lands heavily on all of them.	A moment passes.
THEN SMART HULK HURLS THE BENCH INTO THE WATER. It skips across the surface like a stone.
SMART HULK
She’s not coming back. We have to make it worth it. We have to.
109
STEVE
We will.
PULL BACK, LEAVING OUR MOURNERS IN TABLEAU... 
INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, WORKSHOP - DAY
ALL SIX INFINITY STONES rest behind safety glass. SOON, ROBOTIC ARMS ENTER FRAME, PLUCKING UP THE POWER STONE.
TONY operates the arms as ROCKET and SMART HULK watch.
The robot arms swing the stone over to... A NEW IRON MAN GAUNTLET. NANO-TECH SHIFTS AND SLIDES, HOLDING IT IN PLACE.
Smart Hulk releases a deep breath.
TIME CUT:
THE COMPLETED GAUNTLET sits in a cradle, SIX INFINITY STONES EMBEDDED IN THE BACK. Pull back to find... 
SCOTT, THOR, CLINT, RHODEY, and STEVE watching TONY AND ROCKET FINE TUNE THE GLOVE.
ROCKET
All right. The glove’s ready. Question is, who’s gonna snap their freaking fingers?
Everyone stares a beat.	Then, THOR REACHES FOR THE GAUNTLET.
THOR
I’ll do it.
TONY
Whoa, whoa, what are you doing-
STEVE
Thor, we haven’t decided who’s
putting that on.
THOR
Oh.	Were all of you just waiting
for the right opportunity?
ROCKET
Maybe I was getting around to it-
SCOTT LANG
We should at least discuss it-
110
THOR
Staring at the thing isn’t going to bring everybody back, is it? Look, I’m the strongest Avenger. It’s my responsibility. Fate wills it so.
TONY
Hold on, hold on-
THOR
Stop it! Let me do this. Let me do something good. Something right-
TONY
That thing is channeling enough
energy to light up a continent.
You’re in no condition-
THOR
What do you think is coursing
through my veins right now?
RHODEY
Cheez Whiz?
THOR
Lightning.
Smart Hulk steps toward the Gauntlet.
SMART HULK
Lightning won’t help you, pal.
It’s gotta be me.
(approaching)
You saw what those stones did to
Thanos.	They almost killed him.
None of you could survive.
STEVE
And how do we know you can?
SMART HULK
We don’t.	But the radiation’s
mostly gamma.
(beat)
It’s like I was made for this... 
INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, HANGAR - DAY
THE QUANTUM TUNNEL LIES IN DARKNESS. Then, clack, the lights come on, revealing... 
NEBULA, STARING UP AT THE WAITING MACHINE.
111
INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, WORKSHOP - DAY
SMART HULK STUDIES THE GAUNTLET.	The moment of truth.
TONY
Good to go?
SMART HULK
Let’s do it.
TONY
Okay, remember, everyone Thanos snapped away five years ago, you’re just bringing them back... to today. Don’t change anything from the last five years. Got it?
SMART HULK
Got it.
PAN AROUND as the Avengers ready themselves:
STEVE steps forward, shield on his arm. SCOTT deploys his helmet. RHODEY readies his repulsors.
ROCKET covers his raccoon junk and hides behind THOR. TONY armors up, then nanos a shield to protect CLINT beside him.
TONY
Friday, why don’t you go ahead and activate Barn Door Protocol?
STEEL DOORS SLIDE SHUT ALL AROUND THE WORKSHOP.
FINALLY, SMART HULK HOLDS UP THE GAUNTLET.
SMART HULK
(under his breath)
Everybody’s coming home... 
HE SLOWLY SLIPS HIS HAND IN THE GLOVE. SUDDENLY, HE SPASMS, TAKING IN THE POWER AS THANOS DID IN ML1. HE STRUGGLES.
THOR
What’s happening?	Take it off,
take if off!
STEVE
Bruce, you okay?
TONY
Talk to me, Banner.
112
SMART HULK
I’m... okay... 
THEN SMART HULK REACHES OUT HIS HAND... AND SNAPS HIS FINGERS.
CRAAAACK! THE STONES FLARE. A BRIGHT SURGE OF ENERGY RACES UP SMART HULK’S ARM. HE ROARS AS HIS EYES BLAZE GREEN.
A BLAST WHITES OUT THE SCREEN.
INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, HANGAR - DAY
NEBULA studies THE QUANTUM CONSOLE. She takes off her glove, revealing A PERFECTLY INTACT ARM. THIS IS BAD NEBULA.
SHE OPENS A PANEL IN HER ARM, SNAKES OUT A CABLE... AND JACKS INTO THE CONSOLE. THE QUANTUM TUNNEL boots up.
AS SHE HURRIES AWAY... 
EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND - DAY
FROM HIGH OVERHEAD, WE SEE THE TIME ENERGY SIGNATURE SHOOT FROM THE HANGAR. AN OMINOUS RIPPLE WARPS ACROSS THE SKY... 
INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, WORKSHOP - DAY
WHOOSH! EVERYTHING COMES BACK INTO VIEW. THE GAUNTLET FALLS OFF, ROLLING ACROSS THE FLOOR.
SMART HULK COLLAPSES, ARM WITHERED, SIDE BURNT BLACK.
EVERYONE RUSHES OVER.	Steve checks Smart Hulk’s pulse.
STEVE
Bruce!
TONY
Don’t move him!
Then THE BLAST DOORS OPEN, revealing the sound of... CHIRPING.
SCOTT walks toward the courtyard.
Smart Hulk’s eyes clear.	He grasps Steve’s arm.
SMART HULK
Did it work?
They pause, as if it only just now occurred to them.
JUST THEN... A CELL PHONE BUZZES.
113
A STUNNED CLINT TURNS AND APPROACHES HIS PHONE. On the home screen, we see A PHOTO OF HIS WIFE: “LAURA CALLING.”
CLINT FINALLY PUTS THE PHONE TO HIS EAR.
CLINT BARTON
Honey?
AT THE WINDOW, SCOTT STARES AT A BIRD FEEDER. DOZENS OF CARDINALS AND FINCHES NIBBLE ON THE SEED.
SCOTT LANG
Guys, I think it-
BOOM!	THE BUILDING EXPLODES.	DEBRIS SWALLOWS THE CAMERA.
EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND - DAY
A MUSHROOM CLOUD BILLOWS OVER AVENGERS COMPOUND.
EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, CRATER - DAY
Nothing moves. The smoke clears, revealing... A BOMBED OUT CRATER A MILE WIDE. Avengers Compound has been destroyed.
Then the light changes... AND THE SANCTUARY-2 parts the clouds. It hovers over the ruins like a vulture.
AN ENERGY BEAM drops to the ground, releasing... 
THANOS, FLANKED BY A SQUAD OF OUTRIDERS. The Mad Titan looks around at the devastation he has wrought.
THANOS (INTO COM)
Daughter?
BAD NEBULA (OVER COM)
Yes, father... 
OUT OF THE SMOKE WALKS ”BAD” NEBULA.	Bruised and dirty.
THANOS
So this is the future.	Well done.
She tears off THE ORANGE HEAD-PLATE.
BAD NEBULA
Thank you, Father. They suspected nothing.
THANOS
The arrogant never do.
114
Thanos takes off his helmet, staring up at the crater’s edge.
THANOS (CONT'D)
Go.	Find the stones.	Bring them
to me.
BAD NEBULA
What will you do?
THANOS
Wait.
INT. UNDERGROUND GARAGE, RUINS - DAY
THE UNDERGROUND GARAGE LIES HALF-COLLAPSED.
SMART HULK GRITS HIS TEETH, HOLDING UP THE CEILING WITH ONE GOOD ARM, HIS OTHER ARM BURNED AND LIFELESS. BELOW... 
RHODEY LIES IN THE RUBBLE, WAR MACHINE SUIT SPARKING.
RHODEY
Canopy!	Canopy!
Rhodey’s suit RATCHETS OPEN. HE HAULS HIMSELF FREE to see... ROCKET TRAPPED UNDER RUBBLE. AS HE CRAWLS TO HIM... 
THE CEILING RUMBLES.	SMART HULK WAVERS, MUSCLES QUIVERING.
RHODEY (INTO COM) (CONT'D) Mayday! Tony. Cap. Does anybody hear me?!
HE FINALLY REACHES ROCKET.	Rocket wheezes, in pain.
RHODEY (CONT'D)
Hang on!
RHODEY WEDGES A PIECE OF REBAR INTO THE DEBRIS. HE HEAVES, finally managing to lever it off of Rocket. THEN... 
THE CRACKED CEILING GIVES WAY. A MILLION GALLONS OF RIVER WATER RUSH IN. RHODEY TRIES TO KEEP HIS HEAD ABOVE WATER.
RHODEY (INTO COM) (CONT'D) Mayday! Mayday! We are taking on water!
INT. TOOL SHOP, RUINS - DAY
CLOSE ON SCOTT LANG lying on a SILVER, METAL FLOOR.
115
RHODEY (OVER COM)
... anyone... Mayday... Mayday-
Scott groans, coming to.
SCOTT LANG
Wait, what... ?
REVEAL, TINY SCOTT LYING IN THE RUINS OF THE ARMORY... ON THE IRON PATRIOT HELMET.
ROCKET (OVER COM)
Tell ‘em to... hurry... asses up-
RHODEY (OVER COM)
... trapped... drowning... no time... 
Scott jumps to his feet.
SCOTT LANG (INTO COM)
No!	Wait, I’m here!
Scott spots WATER TRICKLING THROUGH THE CRACKED FLOOR.
INT. ACCESS TUNNEL - DAY
WATER DRIPS FROM A HOLE IN THE ROOF OF AN ACCESS TUNNEL... ONTO CLINT BARTON, LYING FACEDOWN. He groans.
He opens his hand to find HIS CELLPHONE: HIS WIFE SMILES ON THE SCREEN. “LAURA, ONE MISSED CALL.” Clint stares, amazed.
He winces, finding he’s been lying atop... THE GAUNTLET. It’s bashed out of shape, BUT ALL SIX STONES STILL GLEAM.
CLINT BARTON (INTO COM)
Cap?	Stark?	Anyone?
STATIC.	Then, he hears... A SCRAPING SOUND, TALONS ON CEMENT.
He peers down a darkened tunnel, then unshoulders his bow.
HE LOOSES A FLARE ARROW, revealing... 
DOZENS OF OUTRIDERS SCRABBLING ALONG THE WALLS AND CEILING.
CLINT GRABS THE GAUNTLET AND RUNS.	THE CREATURES GIVE CHASE.
INT./EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, LAB, RUINS - DAY
FIRES SMOULDER BENEATH THE COLLAPSED CEILING. MOVE THROUGH SMOKE TO FIND... STEVE, out cold. SOMEONE SHAKES HIM.
He wakes to see TONY, HOLDING HIS SHIELD.
116
TONY
You lose this again, I’m keeping
it.
STEVE
What happened?
TONY
Told you.	We messed with time.
Time messed back.
Woozy, Steve follows Tony through the ruins of the lab.
STEVE
Where are the others?
TONY
I read life signs, maybe 800 feet
down, but it’s hard to tell.
They reach the edge of the crater where THOR LOOKS DOWN AT... THANOS. Sitting on a rock. Waiting.
TONY (CONT'D)
What’s he been doing?
THOR
Absolutely nothing.
The three of them stare a long moment. Then, as if sensing them, Thanos turns his head... AND LOOKS THEIR WAY.
STEVE
Son of a bitch.
TONY
Yeah.
STEVE
Where are the stones?
TONY
Somewhere under all of this. All I know is... he doesn’t have ‘em.
STEVE
So we keep it that way.
That lands.	This is their chance.
THOR
You know it’s a trap.
TONY DEPLOYS HIS ARMOR.
117
TONY
Don’t think I care.
THOR
Just so we’re all in agreement.
Thor holds out his hand: MJOLNIR FLIES INTO IT.	He holds out
his other hand: STORMBREAKER SLAPS INTO HIS PALM.
CRACK!	LIGHTNING STRIKES AS HE’S COVERED IN CAPE AND ARMOR.
THOR (CONT'D)
Let’s kill him properly this time.
STEVE TIGHTENS HIS SHIELD, LEADING THEM INTO THE CRATER... 
EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, CRATER - DAY
Thanos sits on his rock, contemplative.
THANOS
You could not live with your own failure. And where did that bring you? Right back to me.
TONY APPROACHES, WARY, AS IF SNEAKING UP ON A RABID DOG.
STEVE AND THOR FAN OUT ON EITHER SIDE.
THANOS (CONT'D)
I thought by eliminating half of life, the other half would thrive. But you’ve shown me that’s impossible.
(beat)
Life clings to the past with bloody fingernails. As long as there are those who remember what was, there will be those unable to accept what can be. They will resist.
TONY
Yep.	We’re all kinds of stubborn.
THANOS
I’m thankful.	Because now I know
what I must do.
Thanos reaches for his helmet.
THANOS (CONT'D)
I will shred this universe down to its last atom.
(MORE)
118
THANOS (CONT'D)
And then, with the stones you’ve collected for me, create a new one, teeming with life that knows not what it has lost, but only what it has been given. A grateful universe.
STEVE
Born out of blood.
Thanos studies Steve as if seeing him for the first time.
THANOS
They’ll never know it.
THANOS DRAWS A BLADE OFF HIS BACK, TOWERING OVER THEM.
THANOS (CONT'D)
Because you won’t be alive to tell them.
Tony glances over at Steve.	Ready?	Steve nods... 
JUST AS THOR CHARGES THANOS. WHAM! ALL THREE AVENGERS ATTACK, USING THEIR SKILLS IN CONCERT.
THANOS STUMBLES, ON HIS HEELS. THE HEROES PUNISH HIM, RELENTLESS.
PULL UP THROUGH THE HAZE, TO THE SANCTUARY-2... 
INT. SANCTUARY-2, INTERROGATION CELL - DAY
NEBULA huddles alone in A PRISON CELL. After a beat... THE DOORS RATCHET OPEN. She stares into the shadows.
NEBULA
What do you want?
GAMORA STEPS INTO THE CELL. THE TWO SISTERS FROM DIFFERENT ERAS STARE AT EACH OTHER.
GAMORA
In the future... what happens to you and me?
NEBULA
I try to kill you. Several times. But, eventually... we become friends. We become sisters.
GAMORA
That’s hard to believe.
119
NEBULA
A lot of things that happen will be hard to believe.
Gamora nearly smiles.	She takes a long look at Nebula.
Finally... SHE HOLDS OUT HER HAND.
GAMORA
Come on.	We can still stop him.
Nebula takes a deciding moment. Then SHE GRABS GAMORA’S HAND. One sister pulls the other to her feet.
INT. UNDERGROUND GARAGE, RUINS - DAY
SMART HULK STRAINS AGAINST THE CEILING. RHODEY HANGS ONTO A PIPE AS THE WATER RISES.
SMART HULK
Rhodey.	Rocket.	Get out of here.
Save yourselves.
ROCKET SURFACES FROM BELOW, GASPING.
ROCKET
No good. Couldn’t even... find a hole... small enough to abandon you through.
Suddenly, Smart Hulk snarls in pain as THE CEILING DROPS A FOOT. His legs buckle as he struggles against the weight.
Finally he sets his jaw... AND STRAIGHTENS HIS LEGS.
SMART HULK
AAARRRGH!
EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, CRATER - CONTINUOUS
THE BUILDING RIGHTS ITSELF, LEVELING OUT.
INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, RUINS - DAY
A RAGING RIVER ROARS THROUGH THE RUINS. AFTER A BEAT... SCOTT LANG ZOOMS PAST, RIDING A PLASTIC BOTTLE CAP.
RHODEY (OVER COM)
MAYDAY!	MAYDAY!
SCOTT LANG (INTO COM)
HANG ON!	I’M COMING!
120
INT. ACCESS TUNNEL - DAY
SHRIEKING OUTRIDERS CHASE BARTON THROUGH THE TUNNELS. CLINT AFFIXES ARROW-CHARGES TO THE WALLS AS HE RUNS.
Just as the Outriders are about to overtake him, Clint hits a button on his bow, DETONATING THE CHARGES... 
BRINGING THE ROOF DOWN ON TOP OF THE OUTRIDERS.
Clint rolls, coming up directly underneath A VERTICAL SHAFT.
A cluster of Outriders escape the collapse, lunging for him.
Clint shoots a grappling arrow up the shaft, ascending... BUT SO DO THE OUTRIDERS, skittering up the sides.
Clint draws his katana, slashing the aliens just as... 
INT. ACCESS TUNNEL, UPPER CHAMBERS - CONTINUOUS
HE TUMBLES INTO THE UPPER CHAMBER. He gasps, safe. Then he looks up to see (BAD) NEBULA, LOOMING OVER HIM.
CLINT BARTON
Oh, hey.	I know you.
She gently takes the Gauntlet.
BAD NEBULA (INTO COM)
Father.	I have the stones.
CLINT BARTON
What-
Clint tries to get up, but Nebula puts a boot in his chest and A BLASTER TO HIS HEAD... 
GAMORA (O.S.)
Stop.
COVERING CLINT, BAD NEBULA TURNS TO SEE... GAMORA, GUN RAISED.
BAD NEBULA
You’re betraying us?
GAMORA
Not you.
GOOD NEBULA steps from the shadows, hands raised, placating.
Bad Nebula stares at her future self.
121
NEBULA
You don’t have to do this.
BAD NEBULA
I am this.
GAMORA
No.	You’re not.
Good Nebula takes a tiny step forward.	She taps her head.
NEBULA
You’ve seen what we become-
GAMORA
Sister, listen to her-
BAD NEBULA
Shut up.	You’re a traitor!
NEBULA
You can change.
Bad Nebula struggles, her face a twisted grimace.
BAD NEBULA
He won’t let me.
BAD NEBULA FIRES AT GAMORA, JUST AS GOOD NEBULA DRAWS A GUN AND SHOOTS HER DOWN. BAD NEBULA DROPS.
Good Nebula stares at her dead younger self, conflicted.
Clint picks up the gauntlet, very confused.
CLINT BARTON
I’m not even gonna ask.
EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, CRATER - DAY
TONY’S HUD: TONY GLARES RIGHT AT US, AS... 
THOR SMASHES HIS HAMMERS TOGETHER, HURLING LIGHTNING INTO THE BACK OF THE IRON MAN SUIT.
TONY SENDS THE RESULTING OVERLOAD AT THANOS... BUT THANOS PROPELLERS HIS BLADE, HOLDING BACK THE BLAST.
THOR USES STORMBREAKER TO BAT MJOLNIR AT THANOS... 
THANOS SNATCHES TONY BY THE ANKLE AND USES HIM AS A SHIELD AGAINST THE ONCOMING HAMMER. WHACK!
122
MJOLNIR PLOWS INTO THE DIRT.	TONY GOES TUMBLING, OUT COLD.
TONY’S HUD: FRIDAY TRIES TO REVIVE HIM.
FRIDAY (O.S.)
Boss?	Wake up!
INT. UNDERGROUND GARAGE, RUINS - DAY
ROCKET, RHODEY, AND SMART HULK GULP AIR, INCHES FROM THE CEILING, FACING THE END. RHODEY GLANCES OVER AT SMART HULK.
RHODEY
See you on the other side, man.
They take a last breath, THEN THE WATER HITS THE CEILING.
EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, CRATER - DAY
Steve slashes at Thanos.	The Titan brutally bats him aside.
Thor attacks, but Thanos drives him through walls of debris.
THANOS SMASHES HIS FIST INTO THOR’S FACE, OVER AND OVER.
Thor calls for Stormbreaker, but Thanos intercepts it. He presses the blade into Thor’s chest, trying to drive it home.
Then, across the field... MJOLNIR RISES INTO THE AIR.
THANOS GRINS, ABOUT TO FINISH THOR OFF, WHEN... MJOLNIR FLIES IN, KNOCKING THE AXE OUT OF HIS HAND.
Follow the hammer as it flies back to the only other man worthy enough to wield it... STEVE ROGERS.
Half-conscious, THOR SEES STEVE HOLDING MJOLNIR.
THOR
I... knew... it... 
STEVE ATTACKS, CRACKING THANOS IN THE JAW.	THANOS TUMBLES.
BEFORE THE TITAN CAN GET UP, STEVE CALLS DOWN THE LIGHTNING AND SENDS IT CRACKLING INTO THANOS’ BODY.
Steve leaps, trying to finish Thanos off... BUT THANOS ROLLS ASIDE, HEAD-BUTTING STEVE BACKWARDS.
THANOS GETS TO HIS FEET, A FAINT SMILE ON HIS FACE.
HE WHIPS OFF HIS HELMET AND ATTACKS STEVE WITH HIS BLADE.
BLOW AFTER BLOW.	IT’S ALL STEVE CAN DO TO GET HIS SHIELD UP.
123
THANOS HACKS THE SHIELD TO PIECES, FINALLY KNOCKING STEVE ACROSS THE FIELD.
Steve lies beaten, half a shield still attached to his arm.
THANOS
In all my years of conquest... 
Thanos looks out at the tiny human struggling to stand.
THANOS (CONT'D)
Of violence and slaughter... it was never personal.
Thanos gestures behind him as A RUMBLE ECHOES.
THOUSANDS OF ALIENS RING THE LIP OF THE CRATER: THE BLACK ORDER LEADS A PLATOON OF CHITAURI, SAKAARANS, AND OUTRIDERS.
THANOS (CONT'D)
But I’ll tell you now, the things
I’m about to do to your stubborn,
annoying, little planet... 
Q-SHIPS, DROPSHIPS, NECROCRAFT, AND LEVIATHANS BUZZ ABOVE.
THANOS (CONT'D)
I’m going to enjoy it. Very, very much.
Steve stares at Thanos and his army. And even in the face of such overwhelming odds... he gets to his feet.
THANOS stares, almost sad, as Steve tightens the broken shield on his arm... AND STARTS WALKING TOWARD HIM.
One man against thousands.	All alone.
But just then, Steve’s COM CRACKLES.	He strains to hear.
The com crackles again.	We can make out A MUFFLED VOICE.
MUFFLED VOICE (ON COM)
-ap-... -comin-... -ot-
Steve shakes his head, trying to clear it. Slowly, SOUND RETURNS... AND THE WORDS RING CLEAR:
SAM WILSON (O.S.)
Cap.	On your left.
PULL BACK... TO SEE A PORTAL OPENING IN THE DISTANCE. OUT OF IT FLIES... SAM WILSON.
124
Steve watches Sam soar over the field, then turns AS EVEN MORE PORTALS OPEN.
FROM ONE: DR. STRANGE, PETER QUILL, DRAX, MANTIS, PETER PARKER... AND KRAGLIN AND THE RAVAGERS.
FROM ANOTHER: T’CHALLA, OKOYE, SHURI, M’BAKU, WANDA, BUCKY, GROOT... AND THE WAKANDAN ARMY.
FROM A THIRD: VALKYRIE, KORG, MIEK... AND AN ASGARDIAN ARMY.
FROM A FOURTH: PEPPER POTTS (IN RESCUE ARMOR), HOPE VAN DYNE, AND WONG LEADING A SQUAD OF SORCERERS.
THOR gets to his feet, calling Stormbreaker to his hand
as... TONY regains consciousness, staring out at the cavalry.
Wong and Strange quickly find each other.
DR. STRANGE
Is that everyone?
WONG
You wanted more?!
JUST THEN, THE GROUND SHAKES AND RUBBLE EXPLODES UPWARDS AS... GIANT-MAN BURSTS FROM BELOW.
SCOTT LANG
Top floor, everybody out!
HE OPENS HIS HUGE HAND, RELEASING ROCKET, SMART HULK, AND RHODEY, NOW IN HIS COSMIC IRON PATRIOT ARMOR.
STEVE TAKES IN HIS REINFORCEMENTS, THEN STARES OUT AT THANOS.
PAN ACROSS OUR HEROES AS STEVE CALLS MJOLNIR TO HIS HAND.
STEVE
Avengers... assemble.
THOR LETS LOOSE A BATTLE CRY AS HE CHARGES! EVERYONE FOLLOWS SUIT AS OUR HEROES FLOOD THE FIELD.
ACROSS THE WAY, THANOS SMILES AND POINTS HIS BLADE.
TWO MIGHTY ARMIES RACE TOWARD EACH OTHER UNTIL... CLASH!
GIANT-MAN SLUGS A LEVIATHAN IN THE JAW.
DRAX launches himself onto a CULL currently choking the life out of KORG.
125
TONY blasts overhead. RESCUE joins him. Together, they strafe the field.
STEVE and THOR fight together.	Both hold out their hands.
Stormbreaker returns to Steve, Mjolnir to Thor, who frowns.
THOR
No.	You take the little one.
Elsewhere, TONY BATTLES SEVERAL CULLS. One knocks him into an Outrider, who’s about to rip his armor off when... 
THWIP. PETER PARKER webs the Outrider, yanking him into the path of... GIANT-MAN’S FOOT. SQUISH.
Tony stares at Peter, emotional.	They retract their helmets.
PETER PARKER
Mr. Stark. Holy cow, you would not believe what’s been going on. Do you remember when we were in space? And I got all dusty? I must’ve passed out, because I woke up and you weren’t there, but Dr. Strange was, and he was like, “it’s been five years, they need us.” And he started doing that yellow sparkly thing he does-
But Tony just wraps his arms around him, smashing Peter’s face into his chest plate.
PETER PARKER (CONT'D)
(muffled)
Oh.	This is nice.
ACROSS THE FIELD... QUILL flies, firing down on Sakaaran soldiers. One leaps off an outcropping... 
TACKLING QUILL INTO A WRECKED FUSELAGE, WHERE ANOTHER SAKAARAN WAITS.
Quill drops one, but the other raises his weapon to strike.
THEN BLAM!	The Sakaaran drops dead on top of Quill.
He pushes the body off to see... GAMORA, BLASTER STILL SMOKING. Quill stares, amazed.
QUILL
Gamora?
HE APPROACHES, OVERWHELMED, EMOTIONAL.
126
QUILL (CONT'D)
I thought I lost you.
He tenderly strokes her face... and she knees him in the nuts.
Twice.	He goes down, gasping.
QUILL (CONT'D)
You missed the first time... then
you got ‘em both the second time.
She stares down at him as... NEBULA JOINS HER.
GAMORA
This is the one?	Seriously?
NEBULA
Your choices were him or a tree.
ACROSS THE FIELD... CLINT RUNS WITH THE GAUNTLET, PURSUED BY A CHITAURI APE. Just before the ape tramples Clint... 
SAM WILSON SWOOPS IN, CUTTING THE CREATURE DOWN.
Clint runs on.	The heroes confer over coms.
CLINT BARTON
What do you want to do with this
thing?
STEVE
Get those stones as far away as
possible!
SMART HULK
No!	We need to send them back
where they came from.
TONY
There’s no way to send them back.
Thanos destroyed our time machine.
SCOTT LANG
Hold on!
(shrinking to normal size) That wasn’t our only time machine.
He clicks the KEYS TO LUIS’ VAN. From a distance, we hear, “LA CUCARACHA.” Steve immediately gets it.
STEVE
Does anyone see an ugly, brown van out there?
ABOVE, VALKYRIE SCANS THE FIELD FROM HER PEGASUS.
127
VALKYRIE
Yeah. But you’re not going to like where it’s parked.
LUIS’ VAN SITS SURROUNDED BY THOUSANDS OF ALIENS, DEEP BEHIND ENEMY LINES.
STEVE SURVEYS THE FIELD: AN ARMY STANDS BETWEEN THEM AND THE VAN, AIR AND GROUND CHOKED WITH ENEMIES.
TONY (INTO COM)
Scott, how long do you need to get that thing working?
SCOTT LANG
Uh, maybe ten minutes.
STEVE
Get it started.	We’ll get the
stones to you.
HOPE VAN DYNE
We’re on it, Cap.
SCOTT glances at her.	Cap?	THEY SHRINK DOWN AND FLY AWAY.
TONY FLIES UP TO DR. STRANGE, HOVERING.
TONY
Doc. You said we win one in 14 million. Is this how it goes down?
DR. STRANGE
If I tell you what happens, it
won’t happen.
TONY
You better be right.
Tony rockets away.	Strange coolly watches him go.
ACROSS THE FIELD... EBONY MAW RUSHES TO THANOS.
EBONY MAW
Sire, the stones!
THANOS TURNS TO SEE... CLINT FIGHTING THROUGH THE HORDE, CARRYING THE GAUNTLET.
A CULL HAMMERS CLINT, BUT THEN... T’CHALLA SLASHES THE CULL.
T’CHALLA
Clint, give it to me.
128
CLINT HANDS THE GAUNTLET TO T’CHALLA, WHO TUCKS IT AND RUNS.
ACROSS THE FIELD... SCOTT AND HOPE FLY OVER A LONG PLATOON OF CHITAURI, TOWARD LUIS’ VAN.
INT./EXT LUIS’ VAN - CONTINUOUS
They GROW TO NORMAL SIZE in the front seat. Out the windshield, THANOS’ HORDE CHARGES AT THEIR FRIENDS.
SCOTT LANG
(digging around)
Ignition’s broken.	I’ll hotwire it-
HOPE VAN DYNE
Wait, you know how to do that?
Scott splices wires.	Sparks fly.
SCOTT LANG
I was in prison. I know how to do a lot of things.
EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, CRATER - DAY
T’CHALLA RACES THROUGH THE HORDE... BUT THEN THANOS KNOCKS HIM OFF HIS FEET. THE GAUNTLET GOES TUMBLING.
AS THANOS MOVES IN ON T’CHALLA... ALL AROUND, WRECKAGE BEGINS TO FLOAT. THANOS LOOKS UP TO SEE... 
WANDA, HOVERING IN THE AIR, WAITING FOR HIM.
WANDA
You took everything from me.
Thanos takes THE BLADE off his back.
THANOS
I don’t even know who you are.
WANDA
You will.
WANDA UNLEASHES A STORM OF RED ENERGY, HURLING WRECKAGE AT HIM. AS THANOS FIGHTS HIS WAY THROUGH IT... 
T’CHALLA DIVES FOR THE FALLEN GAUNTLET. SUDDENLY... EBONY MAW MANIPULATES THE EARTH, PULLING THE GAUNTLET TOWARD HIM.
T’CHALLA WRAPS HIMSELF AROUND THE GLOVE, GETTING DRAGGED.
129
PETER PARKER (O.S.)
I GOT IT!
T’CHALLA TURNS TO SEE PETER WHIZZING PAST. HE HURLS THE GAUNTLET... THWIP! Peter snatches it out of the air.
HE LANDS, ONLY TO FIND HIMSELF SURROUNDED BY OUTRIDERS.
PETER PARKER (CONT'D)
Activate instant kill!
His robotic arms slash with expert precision.
ACROSS THE FIELD... WANDA LIFTS THANOS INTO THE AIR, RIPS HIS ARMOR OFF IN PIECES, THEN SLAMS HIM BACK TO THE GROUND.
Thanos groans, outmatched.
THANOS (INTO COM)
Rain fire.	Wipe them all out.
CORVUS GLAIVE FIGHTS GROOT.
CORVUS GLAIVE
But, sire, our troops-
THANOS (INTO COM)
Just do it!
HIGH ABOVE... THE SANCTUARY-2 DESCENDS, CANNONS OPENING UP.
BELOW... WANDA looks up, raising a force field just as... 
THE SANCTUARY-2 FIRES DOWN WITH EVERYTHING IT HAS. SAKAARANS AND JABARI ALIKE GO FLYING AS EVERY SQUARE INCH GETS HIT.
THE BARRAGE HAMMERS THE RIVERBANK.	CRACKS FORM.
PEPPER CUTS DOWN AN ALIEN, THEN SPOTS SOMETHING OFF SCREEN.
PEPPER POTTS (INTO COM)
Um, is anyone else seeing this?
TONY, SMART HULK, AND GAMORA turn to see... WATER GUSHING AS THE RIVERBANK THREATENS TO COLLAPSE. SUDDENLY... 
STRANGE AND WONG CONJURE TWO HUGE RUNE SHIELDS TO SHORE UP THE BANK. MORE WIZARDS JOIN, CREATING A HUGE “RUNE LEVEE.”
THE SANCTUARY-2 MAINTAINS ITS BARRAGE.
ACROSS THE FIELD... STEVE spots PETER PARKER gradually being overwhelmed by Outriders.
130
PETER PARKER
I got this... I got this... I don’t
got this.
STEVE
Hey, Queens!	Heads up!
STEVE HURLS MJOLNIR OVER THE THRONG. PETER WEBS ON... LETTING THE HAMMER PULL HIM OUT OF DANGER.
A MORTAR BLAST KNOCKS HIM OUT OF THE SKY, BUT PEPPER POTTS RESCUES HIM.
PEPPER POTTS
Hang on, kid.	I’ve got you.
She drags him above the fray, then tosses him to... VALKYRIE FLYING PAST. PETER PERCHES ATOP PEGASUS.
PETER PARKER
Hey, nice to meet you-aaaaarg!
VALKYRIE SPURS INTO HIGH GEAR, DODGING CANNON FIRE...  BUT NOT FAST ENOUGH. A BLAST KNOCKS PETER TO THE GROUND.
HE GASPS, COVERED IN DEBRIS, STILL CLUTCHING THE GAUNTLET.
ALL AROUND THE FIELD, THE RELENTLESS BARRAGE PINS DOWN OUR HEROES. ALL HOPE IS LOST.
Rocket and Groot dive for cover. Groot wraps his branches around them both.
ROCKET
At least we’re going out together
this time... 
SUDDENLY, EVERYTHING GOES SILENT. ROCKET PEERS OUT FROM COVER TO SEE... THE CANNONS SWIVELING UP TOWARD THE CLOUDS.
SAM WILSON flies overhead.
SAM WILSON
What the hell is this?
TONY’S HUD: TONY FLIES OVERHEAD, SEARCHING UPWARD.
TONY
Friday, what are they firing at?
FRIDAY (O.S.)
Something just entered the upper
atmosphere.
131
Rocket looks up at... A COMET HEADING STRAIGHT FOR EARTH.
GROOT
(nervous)
I am Groot.
Rocket grins, knowing what’s coming.
ROCKET
Just wait for it.
SUDDENLY, THE COMET VEERS... RIGHT TOWARD THE SHIP.
BOOM! THE COMET TEARS THROUGH THE SANCTUARY-2, RIGHT OUT THE OTHER SIDE, REVEALING... CAROL DANVERS.
ROCKET (CONT'D)
Oh, yeah!
CAROL GLOWS BRIGHTER AS SHE GOES BINARY, ROCKETING AGAIN THROUGH THE HULL. BOOM! THE SHIP LISTS, ENGINES EXPLODING.
CAROL EYES THE BATTLEFIELD, EXHAUSTED, LIGHT FADING.
STEVE (OVER COM)
Danvers!	We’re gonna need an
assist down here!
CAROL DANVERS (INTO COM)
(under ragged breath)
Roger... Rogers... 
INT. VAN - DAY
Scott twists wires on the Quantum Tunnel, hotwiring it.
SCOTT LANG (INTO COM)
I’m almost there.	Where’s the
glove?
EXT. CRATER - DAY
CAROL LANDS IN FRONT OF A DAZED PETER PARKER, WHO STILL HOLDS THE GAUNTLET TIGHT. HE LOOKS UP, CONFUSED.
PETER PARKER
Uh, hey.	I’m Peter Parker.
CAROL DANVERS
Hey, Peter Parker.	You got
something for me?
132
Peter hands it over, staring out at the approaching horde.
PETER PARKER
I don’t know how you’re gonna get
it through all that-
WANDA (O.S.)
Don’t worry, kid... 
Peter turns to see... 
WANDA, OKOYE, GAMORA, NEBULA, VALKYRIE, HOPE, AND SHURI WAITING. Wanda’s hands begin to glow.
OKOYE
She’s got help.
Carol glances at PEPPER and MANTIS, then tucks the gauntlet under her arm AND LEADS THEM OUT.
AT THE RIDGE... Thanos spots THE WOMEN OF MARVEL BLASTING THROUGH HIS TROOPS. HE TRACKS THEIR PATH TO... THE VAN.
SCOTT KICKS THE REAR DOORS OPEN, EXPOSING THE QUANTUM TUNNEL.
SCOTT LANG
Thirty seconds!
Thanos understands immediately. HE GRABS PROXIMA’S SPEAR FROM HER, AND STARTS RUNNING... 
ACROSS THE FIELD... EBONY MAW SENDS WANDA TUMBLING, BUT SHURI BLASTS HIM OUT OF THE SKY.
CULL OBSIDIAN HAMMERS VALKYRIE, BUT NEBULA TAKES HIM OUT.
CAROL KEEPS GOING, GAUNTLET TUCKED UNDER HER ARM, GETTING CLOSER AND CLOSER TO... 
THE VAN... WHERE THE QUANTUM TUNNEL BURSTS TO LIFE.
ACROSS THE FIELD... GROUNDED HEROES LOOK UP TO SEE CAROL NOW JUST YARDS AWAY FROM THE GOAL.
SHE PUTS HER HEAD DOWN, FLYING FOR ALL SHE’S WORTH. BUT JUST AS SHE REACHES THE GAPING VAN DOORS... 
THANOS THROWS THE SPEAR... 
BOOM! THE VAN EXPLODES, SENDING SCOTT AND CAROL FLYING, TAKING OUT SOME OF THE WIZARDS HOLDING BACK THE RIVER.
THANOS CATCHES PROXIMA’S RETURNING SPEAR.
133
TIME SLOWS AS... STEVE, THOR, AND TONY SPOT... THE GAUNTLET, LYING UNGUARDED IN THE DIRT.
The problem is... SO DOES THANOS.
TIME RESUMES AS... THEY ALL SCRAMBLE FOR THE STONES. THEY COLLIDE. THANOS SNATCHES UP THE GAUNTLET, KICKING THOR DOWN.
THANOS KNOCKS TONY ASIDE, THEN SQUEEZES THE CRUSHED GAUNTLET, POPPING IT OPEN... JUST WIDE ENOUGH TO PUT HIS HAND INSIDE.
STEVE LUNGES, BUT THANOS THROTTLES HIM. FINALLY CLEAR, THANOS SLIPS ON THE GAUNTLET. BUT BEFORE HE CAN SNAP... 
CAROL ARRIVES. SHE GRABS THE GLOVE, PREVENTING HIM FROM CLOSING HIS FIST. HE HEADBUTTS HER... BUT SHE DOESN’T MOVE.
CAROL PRESSES THANOS DOWN, BUT BEFORE HE FALLS... 
THANOS PULLS THE POWER STONE FROM ITS HOUSING AND PUNCHES CAROL, SENDING HER FLYING.
THE FIELD GOES QUIET.	NOW, NOTHING STANDS IN THANOS’ WAY.
Tony gets to his knees, realizing... 
The Avengers are going to lose.
ACROSS THE FIELD... WATER STARTS TO SPILL INTO THE CRATER.
STRANGE TRIES TO HOLD IT BACK... BUT IT’S A LOSING BATTLE. He looks to Tony... 
Tony meets his eye. And in that moment, all Strange can do is hold up a single finger. “One.”
ACROSS THE FIELD... THANOS RETURNS THE POWER STONE TO THE GAUNTLET. JUST AS THE ENERGY SURGES THROUGH HIM... 
TONY LUNGES FOR THE GAUNTLET IN THANOS’ HAND, NANO-CLAMPING IT IN A VISE. THANOS KNOCKS HIM ASIDE.
HE LIFTS HIS HAND IN THE AIR, TRIUMPHANT.
THANOS
I am... inevitable.
THANOS SNAPS HIS FINGERS. But nothing happens. Confused, Thanos turns the glove over to find... THE STONES ARE GONE.
He looks to see... TONY, NANO-PARTICLES SLIDING AND SHIFTING, FORMING A NEW GAUNTLET ON HIS OWN WRIST:
134
COMPLETE WITH SIX INFINITY STONES. POWER SURGES THROUGH TONY, EXCRUCIATING, BUT HE STILL LIFTS HIS HAND... 
TONY
And I... am Iron Man.
SNAP!
WHOOSH.	THE TIDAL WAVE EVAPORATES INTO MIST.
ALL AROUND THE FIELD, SAKAARANS AND OUTRIDERS FOLD IN ON THEMSELVES, ATOMS DISINTEGRATING.
THANOS LOOKS AROUND, WATCHING HIS TROOPS DISAPPEAR. SHIPS VANISH FROM THE SKY. CULLS, CHITAURI, ALL BLOW AWAY... 
LEAVING THANOS STANDING ALONE. AFTER A LONG MOMENT, HE SITS DOWN ON A ROCK... AND ACCEPTS HIS FATE. He watches as... 
HIS ATOMS DISSOLVE.	FINALLY, THANOS DISAPPEARS.
ACROSS THE FIELD, QUILL turns to GAMORA... BUT FINDS HER GONE.
QUILL
Babe?	Gamora?
ACROSS THE FIELD... TONY STARK FALLS BACK AGAINST THE UPTURNED ROOTS OF A TREE, ARMOR SMOKING, ARM WITHERED AND BLACKENED.
Dying.
RHODEY RUSHES TO HIM, BUT WITH ONE LOOK, HE KNOWS IT’S TOO LATE. TONY EXHALES, ALMOST LETTING GO. Then... 
PETER PARKER lands, kneeling, taking Tony’s hand.
PETER PARKER
Mr. Stark... Tony... it’s okay, it’s okay... Mr. Stark, we won. You did it, sir... 
But Tony gazes past him. Rhodey puts his hand on Peter’s shoulder, guiding him away... 
AS PEPPER ARRIVES.	She kneels, heartsick.
PEPPER POTTS
Hey, Friday, what’ve we got?
FRIDAY (O.S.)
Life functions critical.
Pepper stares into her husband’s eyes... and knows.
135
PEPPER POTTS
Tony, look at me.	We’re going to
be okay... 
He stares at her, tears welling.	I’m sorry.
She touches his face, then leans in to kiss him.
PEPPER POTTS (CONT'D)
You can rest now.
When she pulls back, she sees his eyes, fixed and glassy.
Everything goes quiet. All around, OUR HEROES GATHER, the full weight of what’s happened dawning on them.
Tony Stark is gone.
FADE TO BLACK.
EXT. HIGH SCHOOL NEW YORK CITY - NIGHT
PETER PARKER enters a hallway teeming with students. He searches the crowd, finally finding... NED LEEDS.
As they embrace... 
EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - NIGHT
Fireworks explode over the skyline of San Francisco.
TONY (O.S.)
Everybody wants a happy ending.
But it doesn’t always roll that
way.	Maybe this time.
On Cassie’s porch, SCOTT watches with HOPE and CASSIE, all of them grinning.
EXT. BARTON HOME, FRONT PORCH - DAY
TWO BIKES lean on the porch of THE BARTON FARM HOUSE. Then the front door opens... and COOPER and LILA BARTON step out.
TONY (O.S.)
I’m hoping if you play this back,
it’s in celebration.
(MORE)
136
TONY (O.S.) (CONT'D) I hope families are reunited, I hope we get it back and something like a normal version of the planet has been restored. If there ever was such a thing.
She looks up at... A QUINJET descending from the sky.
EXT. WAKANDA - SUNSET
ON THE PALACE BALCONY... T’CHALLA embraces his mother, RAMONDA. Shuri turns from them to the magnificent sunset.
TONY (O.S.)
God, what a world. Universe, now. If you’d told me ten years ago that we weren’t alone, let alone to this extent, I probably wouldn’t have been surprised. But come on... 
EXT BARTON HOME - DAY
The Quinjet touches down. The rear jump door opens, revealing CLINT. He stares at Lila and Cooper, overwhelmed.
TONY (O.S.)
Who knew what epic forces of dark and light would come into play? For better or worse, that’s the reality our children get to grow up in.
They throw themselves into his arms. He kisses their heads, tears in his eyes. Finally, he looks up to see... 
LAURA BARTON, beaming, tearful, holding THREE YEAR-OLD NATHANIEL’S HAND. Clint gathers them all into a hug.
INT. STARK ECO-COMPOUND, LIVING ROOM - DAY
A HOLOGRAM of TONY STARK projects from an IRON MAN HELMET on the table.
TONY (O.S.)
That’s why I thought I’d probably better record a little greeting, in the case of…an untimely death on my part.
(MORE)
137
TONY (O.S.) (CONT'D) I mean, death at any time is untimely, but... this “time travel” thing we’re going to try to pull off tomorrow has me scratching my head about the “survivability” of it all. But that’s the hero gig, right? Part of the journey is the end.
REVERSE to find PEPPER, MORGAN, HAPPY HOGAN, RHODEY, THOR, STEVE, SMART HULK, and CLINT, all dressed in black, watching.
TONY (CONT'D)
What am I even tripping for?
Everything is going to work out
exactly the way it’s supposed to.
HOLO TONY seems to look out at the gathered heroes... and Morgan in particular.
TONY (CONT'D)
I love you 3000.
He switches off the camera, vanishing.
Tears streaming, Pepper kisses Morgan’s forehead.
EXT. STARK ECO-COMPOUND, BACK STAIRS - DAY
PEPPER and MORGAN slowly descend the stairs, carrying an RT RINGED WITH FLOWERS. The Avengers follow, somber.
