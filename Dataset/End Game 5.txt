EXT. STARK ECO-COMPOUND, LAKESIDE - DAY
LATER... CLINT looks out at the lake.	WANDA approaches.
CLINT BARTON
I just wish there were some way I
could let her know that we won.
That we did it.
WANDA
She knows.	They both do.
Clint puts his arm around her.	They stare out at the water.
EXT. STARK ECO-COMPOUND, PORCH/BACK STAIRS- DAY
ON THE PORCH, HAPPY HOGAN HOLDS MORGAN’S HAND.
HAPPY HOGAN
How are you doing, squirt?	You
hungry?
MORGAN STARK
Uh, huh.
HAPPY HOGAN
What do you want?
MORGAN STARK
Cheeseburgers?
Happy takes a beat, choked up.	Like father like daughter.
HAPPY HOGAN
Did you know your dad liked
cheeseburgers?
MORGAN STARK
No, I didn’t know that.
139
HAPPY HOGAN
I’m going to get you all the
cheeseburgers you want.
EXT. NEW ASGARD, HILLSIDE - DAY
THOR and VALKYRIE look down on NEW ASGARD.
VALKYRIE
So when can we expect you back?
THOR
About that... 
VALKYRIE
Thor, your people need a king.
THOR
They already have one. And she’s a far better king than I could ever be.
VALKYRIE
Are you serious?
THOR
It’s time to be who I am, rather than who I’m supposed to be. And a leader is who you are.
She processes this.	Does she want it?	She does.
VALKYRIE
You know, I’d make a lot of changes around here.
THOR
I’m counting on it, Your Majesty.
Emotional, Val finally SHAKES HIS HAND.
VALKYRIE
What will you do?
THOR
I’m not entirely sure.	For the
first time in a thousand years, I
have no path.
(beat)
But I do have a ride.
REVEAL... THE BENATAR parked behind them, Rocket alongside.
140
ROCKET
Move it or lose it, Hairbag.
INT. BENATAR - DAY
THOR drops his duffle bag on the deck of the Benatar. QUILL, MANTIS, DRAX, NEBULA, and ROCKET ready the engines.
THOR
Home sweet home.	Tree!	Good to
see you.	The Asgardians of the
Galaxy, together again.
He settles beside Quill, who holomaps their course.
THOR (CONT'D)
All right, where first?
He swipes through images on the screen.
QUILL
You know, I’m still in charge,
here, right?
THOR
Of course.	Of course... 
Thor swipes the map again.
QUILL
See, when you keep swiping my map, that sounds kind of like, “of course, I know you think you’re still in charge-”
THOR
Quail, that’s your own insecurities bubbling up.
DRAX
You should fight one another for
the honor of leadership.
NEBULA
Sounds fair.
QUILL
That’s not necessary... 
ROCKET
I’ve got some blasters right here.
Unless you want to use knives.
141
MANTIS
Oh, yes, please, use knives-
QUILL
No one’s using knives!
GROOT
I am Groot!
Quill and Thor exchange nervous laughter.
THOR
There’ll be no knifing young Quail today. Everyone knows who’s in charge.
A long awkward moment passes.
QUILL
Me.
(sotto, to Thor)
Right?
Thor just smiles... 
EXT. NEW ASGARD, HILLSIDE - DAY
The ship rises.	WHOOSH.	IT MAKES THE JUMP AND DISAPPEARS.
EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, RUINS - DAY
CONSTRUCTION CREWS REMOVE RUBBLE FROM AVENGERS COMPOUND. A COMMAND TENT stands in a clearing beside... 
A NEW QUANTUM TUNNEL (3.0).
As STEVE, SAM, and BUCKY wait, SMART HULK makes last minute adjustments. He finally opens A CASE:
THE SIX INFINITY STONES GLOW INSIDE.
SMART HULK
Remember, you’ll have to return the stones to the exact moment they were taken. Otherwise, we’re still looking at a whole bunch of nasty alternate realities.
STEVE
Got it.	I’ll clip all the
branches.
142
Steve takes the case.
SMART HULK
You know, I tried. When I had the gauntlet. I really tried to bring her back.
(beat)
I miss her.
STEVE
Me, too.
SMART HULK
You’d better get going.	We’re
almost ready for you.
Steve and Sam approach the platform.
SAM WILSON
You look a little nervous going by yourself. Ask nicely, I’ll go with you.
STEVE
You’re a good man, Sam.	But this
one’s on me.
When Steve reaches the platform, BUCKY stops him, pointed.
STEVE (CONT'D)
Don’t do anything stupid ‘til I get back, okay?
BUCKY BARNES
How can I?	You’re taking all the
stupid with you.
Steve grins.	Bucky gives him a long hug.
BUCKY BARNES (CONT'D)
Gonna miss you, buddy.
STEVE
It’s going to be okay, Buck.
Steve picks up Mjolnir and takes his place on the platform.
SAM LOOKS TO SMART HULK AT THE CONSOLE.
SAM WILSON
How long’s this gonna take?
143
SMART HULK
For him, as long as he needs. For us, five seconds.
(calling out)
Ready, Cap?	You’re good to go.
Meet you right back here, okay?
Steve glances at Bucky as he answers.
STEVE
You bet.
SMART HULK
Going Quantum in three, two, one.
STEVE TAPS HIS CUFF AND SHRINKS TO NOTHING.
SMART HULK (CONT'D)
Aaand, returning in five... 
four... three... two... one-
Silence.	Nothing happens.
SAM WILSON
Where is he?
SMART HULK
I don’t know.	He blew past our
time stamp.	He should be here.
SAM WILSON
Get him back!
SMART HULK
I’m trying.
SAM WILSON
Get him the hell back-
SMART HULK
I’M TRYING!
Just then... Bucky looks out to the water.
BUCKY BARNES
Sam.
Sam turns... 
EXT AVENGERS COMPOUND, RIVERBANK - CONTINUOUS
Work crews have cleared a space overlooking the river.
There, AN OLD MAN sits on a bench, staring out at the Hudson.
144
Move around him to find SAM watching from A FEW YARDS AWAY.
SAM WILSON
Hey, Cap.
The man turns and we now see: STEVE ROGERS, age 112.
OLD STEVE
Hi, Sam.
SAM WILSON
Something go wrong... or something
go right?
OLD STEVE
I thought, after everything that’s happened... maybe I should try out some of that life Tony always told me to get.
SAM WILSON
How was it?
Steve looks at the river, 112 years of emotion in his face.
OLD STEVE
It was beautiful.
SAM WILSON
I’m happy for you.	Really.
OLD STEVE
Thanks.
SAM WILSON
Only thing bumming me out is now I live in a world without Captain America.
Steve pulls up A CASE from beside him, giving it to Sam.
OLD STEVE
That’s kind of why I’m here.
Sam unzips it, revealing... A BRAND NEW SHIELD.
SAM WILSON
Where did you even get this?
OLD STEVE
I had a little time to travel.
(beat)
Try it on.
145
Sam hesitates. He glances back at Bucky, who nods. Then Sam picks up the shield... and puts it on.
OLD STEVE (CONT'D)
How does it feel?
SAM WILSON
Like it’s someone else’s.
OLD STEVE
It isn’t.
Sam tries to check his emotion.	He shakes Steve’s hand.
SAM WILSON
Thank you.	I’ll try my best.
Steve rests his other hand on Sam’s.
OLD STEVE
That’s why it’s yours.
Sam smiles, noticing... STEVE’S TARNISHED WEDDING RING.
SAM WILSON
You gonna tell me about her?
Steve smiles to himself at the end of a long, long life.
OLD STEVE
Nope.	I don’t think I will.
CUE MUSIC: “IT’S BEEN A LONG, LONG TIME,” HARRY JAMES.
EXT. COLUMBIA HEIGHTS, WASHINGTON DC - DAY
A PACKARD rolls down a block of WASHINGTON D.C. ROW HOUSES.
TITLE: “WASHINGTON D.C., 1949.”
Find a red house in the middle of the block. Move up the steps to the front door... WHICH HANGS WIDE OPEN.
INT. RED HOUSE, COLUMBIA HEIGHTS, WASHINGTON DC - DAY
A TEA CUP LIES SHATTERED on the hardwood. We hear Harry James. Move into the living room... past the record player... 
TO WHERE STEVE DANCES WITH A WOMAN. They rock back and forth barely moving. As they turn, we see... 
146
PEGGY CARTER, tears streaming down her face. He steps on her toe. She laughs. As they turn, we get a good look at... 
Steve Rogers, eyes shut, finally getting the life he deserves.
THE END
