INT. PUBLISHING HOUSE RECEPTION AREA - DAY

It's grand and modern. Random House-Knopf-Taschen is etched on the wall in large gold letters. An old woman enters carrying a tattered manuscript, maybe a thousand pages. She seems haunted, hollow-eyed, sickly. The young receptionist, dressed in a shiny, stretchy one-piece pantsuit, looks up.

RECEPTIONIST

Oh, hi.

OLD WOMAN
(apologetically)

Hi, I was in the neighborhood and thought I'd see --

RECEPTIONIST
I think he's in a conference.
Unfortunately.	I'm really sorry.

OLD WOMAN

Would you just try him?	You never know.
As long as I'm here.	You never know.

RECEPTIONIST
Of course.	Please have a seat.

The old woman smiles and sits, the bulky manuscript on her lap. She stares politely straight ahead.

RECEPTIONIST (CONT'D)

(quietly into headset)
It's her -- I know, but couldn't you just

--	Yes, I know, but -- I know, but she's old and it would be a nice -- Yes, sorry.
(to old woman)

I'm sorry, ma'am, he's not in right now. It's a crazy time of year for us.

The receptionist gestures toward a Christmas tree in the corner. Its ornaments are holograms.

OLD WOMAN

This book -- It's essential that people read it because --
(gravely, patting the

manuscript)
-- It's the truth.	And only I know it.

RECEPTIONIST
(nodding sympathetically)
 
Maybe after the holidays then.

INT. TILED HALLWAY - DAY

The old woman carries her manuscript haltingly down a subway hall. She stops to catch her breath, then continues and passes several archway with letters printed above them. When she arrives at one topped by an LL, she slips a card in a slot. A plastic molded chair drops into the archway. She sits in the chair; it rises.

INT. TUBE -DAY

The woman is still in the chair as it slips gracefully into a line of chairs shooting through a glass tube. The other chairs are peopled with commuters. We stay with the woman as she and the others travel over New York City in the tube. There are hundreds of these commuter tubes crisscrossing the skyline. The woman glances at the manuscript in her lap. It's called:

Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind

This serves as the movie's opening title. The other credits follow, as the old woman studies commuters in passing tubes. Their faces are variously harsh and sad and lonely and blank.

INT. WAITING ROOM - DAY

SUBTITLED: FIFTY YEARS EARLIER

Every doctor's office waiting room: chairs against the wall, magazines on end tables, a sad-looking potted plant, generic seascape paintings on the walls. The receptionist, Mary, 25, can be seen typing in the reception area. Behind her are shelves and shelves of medical files. The door opens and Clementine enters. She's in her early thirties, zaftig in a faux fur winter coat over an orange hooded sweatshirt. She's decidedly funky and has blue hair. Mary looks up.

MARY
May I help you?

CLEMENTINE

(approaching reception area)
Yeah, hi, I have a one o'clock with Dr.
Mierzwiak.	Clementine Kruczynski.

MARY

Yes, please have a seat. He'll be right with you.

Clementine sits. She looks tired, maybe hungover. She picks up a magazine at random and thumbs without interest.

INT. INNER OFFICE AREA - CONTINUOUS
 
Mary pads down the hallway.	She knocks on a closed door.

MIERZWIAK (O.S.)
Yes?

Mary opens the door, peeks in. Howard Mierzwiak, 40's, professional, dry, sits behind his desk studying some papers.

MARY

Howard, your one o'clock.

MIERZWIAK

(not looking up)
Thanks, Mary.	You can bring her in.

She smiles and nods. It's clear she's in love. It's equally clear that Mierzwiak doesn't have a clue. Mary turns to leave.

MIERZWIAK (CONT'D)
(looking up)
Mary...

MARY

(turning back)
Yes?

MIERZWIAK
Order me a pastrami for after?

MARY
Cole slaw, ice tea?

MIERZWIAK

(nodding)
Thanks.

MARY
Welcome, Howard.

She smiles and heads down the hall. Stan, 30's, tall, spindly, and earnest in a lab coat pops out of a doorway.

STAN

Boo.

MARY

Hi.

She glances back nervously at Mierzwiak's open door.

STAN

Barely seen you all morning, kiddo.

He leans in to kiss her. She cranes her neck to keep him off.
 
MARY
(reprimanding whisper)

Stan... c'mon...

STAN
Sorry.	I just --

MARY
(somewhat guiltilly)

It's just...y'know... I mean...

STAN

I know.	Anyway --

MARY
Anyway, I've got to do my tap
dance here.

She indicates the door to the reception area.	Stan nods.

STAN
See you later, alligator.

MARY

'kay.

STAN

Hey, if you're ordering lunch for
Mierzwiak, would you --

MARY
I better do this, Stan.

Stan nods again and Mary opens the door to the waiting room.

MARY (CONT'D)
Ms. Kruczynski?

CLEMENTINE (O.S.)

Hi.

After a moment, Clementine appears in the doorway. Mary leads her down the hall, not looking back.

MARY
(professionally courteous)
How are you today?

CLEMENTINE

Okay, I guess.

MARY

(at Mierzwiak's office)
Here we are.

Mierzwiak steps out from behind his desk.
 
MIERZWIAK
Ms. Kruczynski, please come in.

Clementine enters the office. Mary smiles at Mierzwiak and closes the door, leaving them alone.

INT. OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Mierzwiak directs Clementine to a chair next to a coffee table and a conspicuously placed box of tissues. Mierzwiak sits across from her. He smiles.

MIERZWIAK
How are you today?

CLEMENTINE
Okay, I guess.

MIERZWIAK

(nodding sympathetically)

Well, why don't you tell me what's going on? Do you mind if I turn this on?

He indicates a tape recorder.

CLEMENTINE
I don't care.

He turns it on, smiles at her, gestures for her to begin.

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
Well, I've been having a bad time of it

with um, my boyfriend, I guess.

MIERZWIAK
You guess he's your boyfriend?	Or you
guess you're having a bad time with hm?

CLEMENTINE

What?	No.	I don't like the term
boyfriend.	It's so gay.

Mierzwiak nods. He's attentive, pleasant, and neutral throughout.

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
Maybe gay isn't the right word.	But,

anyway, it's been rough with him... whatever the fuck he is. Heheh. My significant other... heh heh. And I guess on a certain level, I want to break it off, but I feel... y'know... it's like this constant questioning and re questioning. Do I end it? Should I give it more time? I'm not happy, but what do I expect? Relationships require work. You know the drill. The thing that I
 

keep coming back to is, I'm not getting any younger, I want to have a baby... at some point... maybe... right? So then I think I should settle -- which is not necessarily the best word -- I mean, he's a good guy. It's not really settling. Then I think maybe I'm just a victim of movies, y'know? That I have some completely unrealistic notion of what a relationship can be. But then I think, no, this is what I really want, so I should allow myself the freedom to go out and fucking find it. You know? Agreed? But then I think he is a good guy and... It's complicated. Y'know?

MIERZWIAK

I think I know. I think we can help. Why don't you start by telling me about your relationship. Everything you can think of. Everything about him. Everything about you. And we'll take it from there.

She nods, thinks.

CLEMENTINE
Um, well, he's a fucking tidy one --

EXT. COMMUTER TRAIN STATION

SUBTITLE: TWO WEEKS LATER

The platform is crowded with business commuters. Joel is among them. He is in his 30's, gaunt, and holding a briefcase. The platform across the tracks from him is empty. Suddenly he turns and makes his way through the crowd. He climbs the stairs, crosses the overpass to the empty platform. Soon an almost empty train pulls up to that platform. Joel gets on and watches the business commuters through the dirty window as his train pulls out of the station.

EXT. MONTAUK TRAIN STATION - LATER

Joel talks on a phone. The wind howls around him. He tries to shield the mouthpiece as he talks.

JOEL

Hi, Cindy. Joel. Listen, I'm not feeling well this morning. No. Food poisoning, I think. Sorry it took me so long to call in, but I've been vomiting.

EXT. BEACH - DAY

Joel wanders the windy, empty beach, with his briefcase. He passes an old man with a metal detector. They nod at each
 
other.

Later: Joel looks out at the ocean.

Later: Joel sits on a rock and pulls out a notebook. He opens it and writes with a gloved hand.

JOEL

January 13th, 2006. Today I skipped work and took the train out to Montauk.
(thinks)
It's cold.
(thinks some more)
The sky is gray.
(thinks some more)

I don't know what else to say. Nothing happens. Nothing changes. I saw Naomi last night. We had sex. It was weird to fall into our old familiar sex life so easily. Like no time has passed. After two years apart suddenly we're talking about getting together again. I guess that's good.

He has no other thoughts. He glances up, spots a female figure in the distance, walking in his direction. She stands out against the gray in a fluorescent orange hooded sweatshirt. It's Clementine. He watches her for a bit, then as she nears, he goes back to his writing, or at least pretends to. Once she passed, he watches her walk away. She stops and stares out at the ocean. Joel writes.

JOEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)

If I'm constitutionally incapable of making eye-contact with a woman I don't know. I guess I'd better get back to Naomi.

Later: Joel walks up near the beach houses closed for the season. He peeks cautiously in a dark window.

Later: Joel digs into the sand with a stick.

INT. DINER - DAY

It's a local tourist place, but off-season empty. Joel sits in a booth and eats a grilled cheese sandwich and a bowl of tomato soup. An elderly couple drink coffee at the counter. Clementine enters, looks around, takes off her hood. Joel glances at her bright blue hair. She picks an empty booth and sits. Joel studies her discreetly. The waitress approaches her with a coffee pot.

WAITRESS

Coffee?

CLEMENTINE
 
God, yes.	You've saved my life!

The waitress pours the coffee.

WAITRESS
You know what you want yet?

CLEMENTINE
(laughing)

Ain't that the question of the century.

The waitress is not amused.

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)

You got grilled cheese and tomato soup?

WAITRESS

Yeah.	We're having a run on it.

The waitress heads to the grill. Clementine fishes in her bag, brings the coffee cup under the table for a moment, pours something in, then brings the cup back up.

CLEMENTINE

(calling)
And some cream, please.

Clementine looks around the place. Her eyes meet Joel's before he is able to look away. She smiles vaguely. He looks embarrassed, then down at his journal. Clementine pulls a book from her purse and starts to read. Joel glances up, tries to see the cover. It's blue. He can't read the title.


EXT. BEACH - DAY

Joel stares out at the ocean. Far down the beach Clementine stares at it, too. Joel glances sideways at her then back at the ocean.

EXT. MONTAUK TRAIN STATION PLATFORM - LATE AFTERNOON

Joel sits on the bench waiting for a train. Clementine enters the platform, sees Joel, the only other person there. She waves, sort of goofily enthusiastic, playing as if they're old friends. He waves back, embarrassed. She takes a seat on a bench far down the platform. Joel stares at his hands, pulls out his journal and tries to write in order to conceal his awkwardness.

INT. TRAIN - A BIT LATER

Joel sits at the far end of the empty car and watches the slowly passing desolate terrain. After a moment the door between cars opens and Clementine enters. Joel looks up.

Clementine is not looking at him; she busies herself deciding where to sit. She settles on a seat at the opposite end of
 

the car. Joel looks out the window. He feels her watching him. The train is picking up speed. Finally:

CLEMENTINE

(calling over the rumble)
Hi!

Joel looks over.

JOEL
I'm sorry.

CLEMENTINE
Why?

JOEL
Why what?

CLEMENTINE

Why are you sorry?	I just said hi.

JOEL

No, I didn't know if you were talking to
me, so...

She looks around the empty car.

CLEMENTINE
Really?

JOEL
(embarrassed)

Well, I didn't want to assume.

CLEMENTINE

Aw, c'mon, live dangerously. Take the leap and assume someone is talking to you in an otherwise empty car.

JOEL
Anyway.	Sorry.	Hi.

Clementine makes her way down the aisle towards Joel.

CLEMENTINE

It's okay if I sit closer? So I don't have to scream. Not that I don't need to scream sometimes, believe me.

(pause)

But I don't want to bug you if you're
trying to write or something.

JOEL

No, I mean, I don't know. I can't really think of much to say probably.

CLEMENTINE
 
Oh.	So...

She hesitates in the middle of the car, looks back where she came from.

JOEL

I mean, it's okay if you want to sit down here. I didn't mean to --

CLEMENTINE
No, I don't want to bug you if you're
trying to --

JOEL

It's okay, really.

CLEMENTINE

Just, you know, to chat a little, maybe.
I have a long trip ahead of me.
(sits across aisle from Joel)
How far are you going?	On the train, I
mean, of course.

JOEL

Rockville Center.

CLEMENTINE

Get out!	Me too!	What are the odds?

JOEL

The weirder part is I think actually I recognize you. I thought that earlier in the diner. That's why I was looking at you. You work at Borders, right?

CLEMENTINE
Ucch, really?	You're kidding.	God.

Bizarre small world, huh?	Yeah, that's
me: book slave there for, like, five
years now.

JOEL

Really?	Because --

CLEMENTINE
Jesus, is it five years?	I gotta quit
right now.

JOEL

--	because I go there all the time. I don't think I ever saw you before.

CLEMENTINE

Well, I'm there. I hide in the back as much as is humanly possible. You have a cell phone? I need to quit right this minute. I'll call in dead.
 

JOEL

I don't have one.

CLEMENTINE
I'll go on the dole.	Like my daddy
before me.

JOEL

I noticed your hair. I guess it made an impression on me, that's why I was pretty sure I recognized you.

CLEMENTINE

Ah, the hair.
(pulls a strand in front of her
eyes, studies it)

Blue, right? It's called Blue Ruin. The color. Snappy name, huh?

JOEL
I like it.

CLEMENTINE

Blue ruin is cheap gin in case you were
wondering.

JOEL
Yeah.	Tom Waits says it in --

CLEMENTINE
Exactly!	Tom Waits.	Which song?

JOEL

I can't remember.

CLEMENTINE

Anyway, this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names. Red Menace, Yellow Fever, Green Revolution. That'd be a job, coming up with those names. How do you get a job like that? That's what I'll do. Fuck the dole.

JOEL
I don't really know how --

CLEMENTINE

Purple Haze, Pink Eraser.

JOEL
You think that could possibly be a full

time job?	How many hair colors could
there be?

CLEMENTINE
(pissy)
 
Someone's got that job.
(excited)

Agent Orange! I came up with that one. Anyway, there are endless color possibilities and I'd be great at it.

JOEL

I'm sure you would.

CLEMENTINE

My writing career! Your hair written by Clementine Kruczynski.

(thought)
The Tom Waits album is Rain Dogs.

JOEL
You sure?	That doesn't sound --

CLEMENTINE

I think. Anyway, I've tried all their colors. More than once. I'm getting too old for this. But it keeps me from having to develop an actual personality. I apply my personality in a paste. You?

JOEL
Oh, I doubt that's the case.

CLEMENTINE

Well, you don't know me, so... you don't know, do you?

JOEL
Sorry.	I was just trying to be nice.

CLEMENTINE
Yeah, I got it.

There's a silence.

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
My name's Clementine, by the way.

JOEL

I'm Joel.

CLEMENTINE

No jokes about my name? Oh, you wouldn't do that; you're trying to be nice.

JOEL
I don't know any jokes about your name.

CLEMENTINE

Huckleberry Hound?

JOEL
 
I don't know what that means.

CLEMENTINE
Huckleberry Hound!	What, are you nuts?

JOEL
I'm nut nuts.

CLEMENTINE

(singing)
Oh my darlin', oh my darlin', oh my
darlin' Clementine?	No?

JOEL

Sorry.	It's a pretty name, though.	It
means "merciful", right?

CLEMENTINE
(impressed)

Yeah.	Although it hardly fits.	I'm a
vindictive little bitch, truth be told.

JOEL
See, I wouldn't think that about you.

CLEMENTINE
(pissy)

Why wouldn't you think that about me?

JOEL

Oh. I don't know. I was just... I don't know. I was... You seemed nice, so --

CLEMENTINE

Now I'm nice? Don't you know any other adjectives? There's careless and snotty and overbearing and argumentative... mumpish.

JOEL
Well, anyway... Sorry.

They sit in silence for a while.

CLEMENTINE
I just don't think "nice" is a
particularly interesting thing to be.

The conductor enters the car.

CONDUCTOR
Tickets.

Joel hands the conductor his ticket. The conductor punches it and hands it back.

CLEMENTINE
 

What is nice, anyway? I mean, besides an adjective? I guess it can be an adverb, sort of.

The conductor turns to Clementine.	She fishes in her bag.

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)

It doesn't reveal anything.	Nice is
pandering.	Cowardly.

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
And life is more interesting than that.

Or should be.	Jesus God, I hope it is...
someday.
(to conductor)
I know it's here.

The conductor and Joel watch as she gets more agitated.

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)

I don't need nice. I don't need myself to be it and I don't need anyone else to be it at me.

JOEL
Okay.

CLEMENTINE
Shit.	Shit.	I know it's here.	Hold on.

She dumps the contents of the bag onto the seat and sifts frantically through. Joel sees the book she was reading in the diner. It's The Play by Stephen Dixon.

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
Damn it.	DAMN IT!
(there it is)

Oh.	Here.

She hands the conductor the tickets, smiles sweetly. He punches it, hands it back to her, and walks away.

CONDUCTOR
Next stop Southampton.

The conductor heads into the next car. Clementine shoves stuff back into her purse. Her hands are a little shaky. She pulls a airline-sized bottle of alcohol from her pocket, opens it, and downs it. Joel is watching all of this but pretending not to. She looks out the window for a while. The train pulls into the station. The doors open. Nobody gets on. The doors close. The train pulls out.

CLEMENTINE

Joel?	It's Joel, right?

JOEL
 
Yes?

CLEMENTINE

I'm sorry I... yelled at you. Was it yelling? I can't really tell. Whatever, I'm a little out of sorts today.

JOEL
That's okay.

CLEMENTINE
(stares out window)

My embarrassing admission is I really like that you're nice. Right now, anyway. I can't tell from one moment to the next what I'm going to like. But right now I'm glad you said, "that's okay" to me. That was nice of you.

JOEL
It's no problem.	Anyway, I have some
stuff I need to --

CLEMENTINE

Oh, okay.	Well, sure, I'll just...
(stands, throws bag over
shoulder)

Take care, then.

JOEL
(pulling journal from
briefcase)

Probably see you at the book store.

CLEMENTINE
(heading toward other end of
car)

Unless I get that hair-color-naming job.

Clementine sits and stares out the window.

INT. TRAIN - LATER

There are a few more people in the car now. Clementine has inched a few seats closer to Joel. She watches him. His head is immersed in his journal.

INT. TRAIN - LATER

It's dark out. The train is pretty crowded. Joel stares out the window. Clementine sits closer still to Joel, eyes him.

EXT. TRAIN STATION - EVENING

The doors open and Joel emerges along with others. He heads to the parking lot, arrives at the car. There's a big dented scrape along the driver's side. He gets in.
 

INT. CAR - MOMENTS LATER

Joel drives.	He passes Clementine walking.	She looks cold.

He considers, slows, rolls down his window.

JOEL

Hi.	I could give you a ride if you need.

CLEMENTINE
No, that's okay.	Thanks, though.

JOEL
You're sure?	It's cold.

CLEMENTINE
I don't want to take you out of your way.

JOEL

It's okay.

CLEMENTINE

Yeah?

He pulls over.	She climbs in.	They drive.

JOEL

Where do you live?

CLEMENTINE
You're not a stalker or anything, right?

JOEL

Well, I probably wouldn't say if I were, but no.

CLEMENTINE

You can't be too careful.	I've been
stalked.	I've been told I'm highly
stalkable.	I don't need that.

JOEL

I'm not a stalker.

CLEMENTINE
(beat)
You know Wilmont?

JOEL

Yeah.

CLEMENTINE

Wilmont.	Near the high school.

Joel turns.	They drive in silence.

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
 
Look, I'm very sorry I came off sort of
nutso.	I'm not really.

JOEL

It's okay.	I didn't think you were.

There's a silence.

CLEMENTINE

So you like bookstores, huh?

JOEL

I like to read.

CLEMENTINE
Me too.	It is Rain Dogs, by the way.

JOEL
Yeah?	I can't remember that album very

well.	I remember liking it.	But --

CLEMENTINE

The song's 9th and Hennepin. I spent most of the train ride trying to remember. "Till you're full of rag water and bitters and blue ruin/And you spill out/Over the side to anyone who'll listen." Remember?

JOEL
Sort of, um...

CLEMENTINE

Remember? "And you take on the dreams of the ones who have slept there/And I'm lost in the window/I hide on the stairway/I hang in the curtain/I sleep in your hat..."

(starts to cry)

Oh, shit.	I'm so stupid.	Sorry.

JOEL

What?

CLEMENTINE
I'm just a bit of a wreck.	"I sleep in
your hat" makes me cry.

(pointing to a house)
Me.

Joel pulls over.

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)

Thanks very much. That was very nice of you.

JOEL
 
Well, I wouldn't want to be --

CLEMENTINE
Oh, geez, I'm full of shit.	I already

told you that.
(pause)
Anyway.	See Ya.

Clementine opens the car door.

JOEL
Take care.

CLEMENTINE

(turning back)

Hey, do you want to have a drink? I have lots of drinks. And I could --

JOEL

Um --

CLEMENTINE

Never mind. Sorry, that was stupid. I'm embarrassed. Good night, Joel.

INT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - A FEW MINUTES LATER

Joel stands in the living room, somewhat nervously. He tries to calm himself by focusing on the surroundings. He looks at the books on her shelves. Clementine is in the kitchen. We see her as she passes by the doorway several times, preparing drinks and chatting.

CLEMENTINE

Thanks. I like it, too. Been here about four years. It's really cheap. My downstairs neighbor is old so she's quiet, which is great. And the landlord's sweet, which is bizarre, but great, and I have a little porch in the back, which is great, because I can read there, and listen to my crickets and...

Clementine is in the living room now with two gin and tonics.

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
Two blue ruins...

Joel is looking at a framed black and white photograph of crows flying.

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)

You like that?

JOEL
Very much.
 
CLEMENTINE

This... someone gave that to me, just like, recently. I like it, too. I like crows. I think I used to be a crow.

She caws and hands Joel a drink.

JOEL
Thanks.	That was good, that crow sound.

CLEMENTINE
Do you believe in that stuff?

Reincarnation?

JOEL
I don't know.

CLEMENTINE
Me neither.	Oh, there's an inscription

on the back.

(takes it off the wall, reads:) The way a crow/Shook down on me/The dust of snow/From a hemlock tree/Has given my heart/A change of mood/And saved some part/Of a day I rued.

JOEL

Frost?

CLEMENTINE
(impressed)
Yeah.	I'm not, like, a Robert Frost

lover by any stretch.	His stuff seems
strictly grade school to me.	But this
made me cry for some reason.	Maybe
because it is grade school.	Y'know?

JOEL
It's pretty.

CLEMENTINE

I miss grade school. I don't know why I'm calling it grade school all of a sudden. When I went we called it elementary school. But I like grade school better. Sounds like something someone from the forties would call it. I'd like to be from then. Everyone wore hats. Anyway, cheers!

JOEL
Cheers.

They click glasses. Clementine giggles and takes a big gulp of her drink. Joel sips. She plops down on the couch and pulls her boots off.
 
CLEMENTINE
God, that feels so fucking good.	Take

yours off.

JOEL
I'm fine.

CLEMENTINE
Yeah?	Well, have a seat, anyway.

Joel sits in a chair across the room. Clementine finishes her drink.

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)

Ready for another?

JOEL

No, I'm okay for now.

She heads toward the kitchen with her glass.

CLEMENTINE

Well, I'm ready.	Put some music on.

Joel crosses to the CD's and studies them.

JOEL

What do you want to hear?

CLEMENTINE (O.S.)
You pick it.

JOEL
You just say.	I'm not really --

CLEMENTINE (O.S.)
I don't know!	I can't see them from

here, Joel!	Just pick something good.

Joel studies the unfamiliar CD's. He picks up Bang On a Can performing Brian Eno's Music for Airports to look at. Clementine reenters with her drink.

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)

Oh, excellent choice.

She grabs it and sticks it in the CD player. The music is dreamy and haunting and slow. Clementine falls back onto the couch, closes her eyes and sips her drink.

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
Mmmmmmm.	Way to go, Joel.	You pick

good.

Joel sits down in his chair and drinks. There's a silence, which seems fine to Clementine but makes Joel anxious.
 
JOEL
Well, I should probably get going.

CLEMENTINE

No, stay.	Just for a little while.
(opens her eyes, brightly)
Refill?

JOEL

No.	I --

CLEMENTINE

I know a man who needs a refill.

She grabs Joel's drink from his hand, takes it into the kitchen.

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D) (O.S.) (CONT'D)

God bless alcohol, is what I say. Where would I be without it. Oh, Jesus, Mary, and Joseph, maybe I don't want to think about that.

She giggles. Joel looks around the room again. There are several potatoes dressed as women in beautiful handmade costumes: a nurse potato, a stripper potato, a schoolteacher potato, a housewife potato. Clementine returns with Joel's drink and a refill for herself.

JOEL
Thanks.

CLEMENTINE
Drink up, young man.	It'll make the

whole seduction part less repugnant.

Joel looks a little alarmed.

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)

I'm just kidding.	C'mon.

She sits back on the couch, closes her eyes. Joel watches her, looks at her breasts. She opens her eyes, smiles drunkenly at him.

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
Y'know, I'm sort of psychic.

JOEL

Yeah?

CLEMENTINE

Well, I go to a psychic and she's always telling me I'm psychic. She should know. Do you believe in that stuff?

JOEL
 
I don't know.

CLEMENTINE

Me neither. But sometimes I have premonitions, so, I don't know. Maybe that's just coincidence. Right? Y'know, you think something and then it happens, or you think a word and then someone says it? Y'know?

JOEL
Yeah, I don't know.	It's hard to know.

CLEMENTINE

Exactly. Exactly! That's exactly my feeling about it. It's hard to know. Like, okay, but how many times do I think something and it doesn't happen? That's what you're saying, right? You forget about those times. Right?

JOEL

Yeah, I guess.

CLEMENTINE
(dreamy beat)
But I think I am.	I like to think I am.

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)

It's helpful to think there's some order to things. You're kind of closed mouthed, aren't you?

JOEL

Sorry. My life isn't that interesting. I go to work. I go home. I don't know what to say.

CLEMENTINE

Oh.
(considers this)

Does that make you sad? Or anxious? I'm always anxious thinking I'm not living my life to the fullest, y'know? Taking advantage of every possibility? Just making sure that I'm not wasting one second of the little time I have.

JOEL

I think about that.

She looks at him really hard for a long moment. Joel tries to hold her gaze, but can't. He looks down at his drink. Clementine starts to cry again.

CLEMENTINE
You're really nice.	I'm sorry I yelled
 
at you before about it.	God, I'm an
idiot.

JOEL

I do have a tendency to use that word too much.

CLEMENTINE

I like you. That's the thing about my psychic thing. I think that's my greatest psychic power, that I get a sense about people. My problem is I never trust it. But I get it. And with you I get that you're a really good guy.

JOEL
Thanks.

CLEMENTINE

And, anyway, you sell yourself short. I can tell. There's a lot of stuff going on in your brain. I can tell. My goal... can I tell you my goal?

JOEL
Yeah.

CLEMENTINE
(ala Paul Simon)

What's the goal, Joel?
(laughs)

My goal, Joel, is to just let it flow through me? Do you know what I mean? It's like, there's all these emotions and ideas and they come quick and they change and they leave and they come back in a different form and I think we're all taught we should be consistent. Y'know? You love someone -- that's it. Forever. You choose to do something with your life

--	that's it, that's what you do. It's a sign of maturity to stick with that and see things through. And my feeling is that's how you die, because you stop listening to what is true, and what is true is constantly changing. You know?

JOEL
Yeah.	I think so.	It's hard to --

CLEMENTINE

Like I wanted to talk to you. I didn't need any more reason to do it. Who knows what bigger cosmic reason might exist?

JOEL
Yeah.
 

CLEMENTINE

You're very nice.	God, I have to stop
saying that.	You're nervous around me,
huh?

JOEL

No.

CLEMENTINE
I'm nervous.	You don't need to be
nervous around me, though.	I like you.

Do you think I'm repulsively fat?

JOEL
No, not at all.

CLEMENTINE
I don't either.	I used to.	But I'm

through with that.	Y'know, if I don't
love my body, then I'm just lost.	You
know?

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)

With all the wrinkles and scars and the
general falling apart that's coming
'round the bend.

(beat)
So, I've been seeing this guy...

Joel looks slightly crestfallen.

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
(off his reaction)

Well, for the last week, anyway! He's kind of a kid. Kind of a goofball, but he's really stuck on me, which is flattering. Who wouldn't like that? And he's, like, a dope, but he says these smart and moving things sometimes, out of nowhere, that just break my heart. He's the one who gave me that crow photograph.

JOEL

Oh, yeah.

CLEMENTINE

That made me cry. But, anyway, we went up to Boston, because I had this urge to lie on my back on the Charles River. It gets frozen this time of year.

JOEL
That's scary sounding.

CLEMENTINE
Exactly!	I used to do it in college and
 

I had this urge to go do it again, so I got Patrick and we drove all night to get there and he was sweet and said nice things to me, but I was really disappointment to be there with him. Y'know? And that's where psychic stuff comes in. Like, it just isn't right with him. Y'know?

JOEL
I think so.

CLEMENTINE

I don't believe in that soulmate crap anymore, but... he says so many great things. We like the same writers. This writer Stephen Dixon he turned me on to. And he's cute. It's fucked up. Joel, you should come up to the Charles with me sometime.

JOEL

Okay.

CLEMENTINE
Yeah?	Oh, great!

She sits closer to him.

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)

I'll pack a picnic -- a night picnic -- night picnics are different -- and --

JOEL

(shy)
Sounds good.	But right now I should go.

CLEMENTINE
(pause)

You should stay.

JOEL

I have to get up early in the morning
tomorrow, so...

CLEMENTINE
(beat)

Okay.

Joel puts on his overcoat. Clementine heads to the phone table, pulls out a notepad.

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
I would like you to call me.	Would you

do that?	I would like that.

JOEL
 
Yes.

She scribbles her phone number, hands it to him. He puts it in his pocket. He stands there uncomfortably for a moment, then forces himself to speak.

JOEL (CONT'D)

I don't think your personality comes out of a tube. I think the hair is just... a pretty topping.

She tears up, swallows, and kisses him on the cheek. He's surprised and pleased and nervous.

JOEL (CONT'D)
(shyly formal)
So, I enjoyed meeting you.

CLEMENTINE

You'll call me, right?

JOEL

Yeah.

CLEMENTINE
When?

JOEL
Tomorrow?

CLEMENTINE
Tonight.	Just to test out the phone

lines and all.

JOEL
Okay.

We stay with Clementine as she watches Joel tromping through the snow and getting in his car.

INT. JOEL'S CAR - NIGHT

Joel speeds through the suburban Rockville Center neighborhood. There is no snow on the ground. He seems different, somehow foggy and disoriented.

SUBTITLE:	THREE DAYS EARLIER

He arrives at his apartment building and parks.

EXT. JOEL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

Joel gets out of his car, spots a van parked across the street. There are two dark figures inside.

VOICE-OVER
Them.
 

He hurries inside the building.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Joel enters, dumps his overcoat on a chair, turns off the lights, crosses to look furtively out the window. It's snowing in large flakes which seem to fall only in the beam of a streetlight.

JOEL
It was snowing.

VOICE-OVER

There are two of them.	Couldn't make
them out.	The orange glow of a
cigarette.

Joel squints to see inside the van. Two dark figures talk. One sucks on a cigarette and s dim orange light momentarily illuminates the interior. The figure in the driver seat rolls down his window and gives a cheery wave to Joel.

JOEL

The driver waved.	So casual, friendly.

VOICE-OVER

I'm like a joke to them.

Joel pulls away from the window, his face blanched.

VOICE-OVER

I guess they figure they can act like
they want.	They don't have to worry
about me remembering.

He paces, mulling things over. As he does, the scene starts to change, almost as if it is drying out.

JOEL
I might be making a mistake.

VOICE-OVER

Maybe I'm making a mistake. Maybe I just need to learn to live with this. First of all, I'll get over it. Secondly, it happened. Those who do not remember history are condemned to repeat it. Who said that? Churchill? I'm not sure. But I don't care. She did it to me. I

have to rid myself of this.	Fuck her.

JOEL
Fuck you, Clementine.

The colors bleach, the surroundings become slightly vague.
Even Joel's persona and voice-over seem to alter, his
 

emotional intensity becoming diffused. Joel does not seem aware of this. He stops pacing, takes a small vial from his pocket, dumps the lone pill onto his palm. He looks at it. It's pink. There's some illegible initials stamped on it.

JOEL (CONT'D)
Pink.

(beat)
There was a number on it.	I remember.
AL 1718?
(beat)
I have to follow through with this.	I

have no choice.

VOICE-OVER

The pill was pink, I remember. It had some letters and numbers on it. What were they? AL 1718? AL something. Four digits. I don't like taking pills when I don't know what they are. I have no choice.

He swallows it, peeks out the window again, takes off his clothes, slips into a pair of pajamas fresh from the store packaging. He sits on the edge of the bed, dials the phone.

JOEL (CONT'D)

We're sorry, the number you have
dialed...
(beat)
Screw you, Clementine, for doing this ...

RECORDED VOICE

We're sorry, the number you have dialed is no longer in service. If you think you have reached this recording in error
-

JOEL (CONT'D)

Bye.

Joel hangs up and lies on his back on the bed. By now the scene is lifeless, almost a husk. He hears the apartment building door open. He hears footsteps.

JOEL (CONT'D)
It's them.

VOICE-OVER

It's too late.

His eyelids are getting heavy.	He closes his eyes.

BLACK.

He hears a key in his apartment door.
 
JOEL (CONT'D)
Fuck.

INT. BOOKSTORE - NIGHT

Joel sits in the bookstore coffee shop. It's a jarring transition, visually and emotionally. Joel is in the midst of some traumatic state of mind.

He fingers the vial with the pink pill in it as he watches Clementine stack books on shelves. Her hair is bright orange now.

JOEL
I should maybe talk to you.

VOICE-OVER

Clementine. I should just maybe talk to her.

Joel rises and heads toward Clementine.

JOEL

I love you and if you knew that... if I told you what happened... I'll explain everything, what we meant to each other. I'll tell you everything about our time together. You'll know everything again and...

VOICE-OVER

Maybe if I just explain what happened, I wouldn't have to go through this and I could tell you everything and it would be like you knew and we could rebuild and we could be happy again and...

Right before Joel gets there, Patrick, a skinny young man approaches Clementine. Joel stops, watches. The young man seems out of breath. He glances over at Joel, then taps Clementine on the shoulder. She turns, annoyed, sees who it is and her face lights up.

JOEL
Clementine.

VOICE-OVER
That's your look for me.

Clementine giggles, stands and pokes Patrick playfully in the ribs.

PATRICK

I just thought I'd say hi. I was in the neighborhood.

CLEMENTINE
You were not.
 

PATRICK

I was not.

Joel is mesmerized by their familiarity. As he stands there, the scene starts to dry out.

Clementine and Patrick continue their flirtation but it's turning lifeless, as if they are just reciting lines. The bookstore start to lose its color and immediacy.

CLEMENTINE
Come over after I'm done here?

PATRICK

I can't.	I want to, but I have to study.

CLEMENTINE

You rat.

PATRICK
I really want to, but tonight's
important.	Test tomorrow.

JOEL

How could she have done this to me? How could anyone do this to anyone?

CLEMENTINE
(to Patrick)

You didn't say anything about my hair.

PATRICK

It's so cool.	You're by far the most
sensational person in the room.

CLEMENTINE
In the room?

PATRICK

In the world.

Joel seems dazed, in some sort of dream confusion, as he realizes the world around him is looking increasingly odd.

JOEL
What's happening here?
(looks at watch; it's 9:30)

Oh, God! I have to go home. They'll be there soon.

Joel turns to leave.

INT. JOEL'S CAR - NIGHT

Joel drives fast, recklessly. The intensity is back. He's weeping as he drives.
 
JOEL

Gotta get home. How could she do this to me?

How could she not care about what we meant to each other. What a fuck! What a fucking monster she is!

VOICE-OVER

Oh, God. I miss her. I can't believe she's with that guy now! I'm never going to see her again. I love her so much. What a fucking monster she is!

The scene is faded as he parks in front of his apartment building, and gets out of the car. Joel spots the parked van. We've seen this before, but it's dried out now.

JOEL
Them.

EXT. NEW YORK STREET - DAY

Joel trudges along carrying two big trash bags full of stuff. He's been crying. He looks behind him and finds himself looking out the window of his apartment at the dark van on the snowy street. He turns back to the New York Street and spots the address he was looking for: 610 11th Avenue.
