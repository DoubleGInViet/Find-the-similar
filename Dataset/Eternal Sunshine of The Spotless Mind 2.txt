INT. WAITING ROOM - DAY

Joel sits in the small room with his bags. A woman across from him cradles a box full of belongings in her lap. Her eyes are red from crying. Mary, the receptionist, pokes her head through her window into the waiting room.

MARY
Hello again, Mr. Barish.	Good, you've

got your stuff.

INT. HALLWAY - DAY

Joel walks with his bags behind Mary.

MARY

(not looking back)
How are you today?
(at lab)

Here we are.

INT. LABORATORY - DAY

Joel enters. Mierzwiak stands there with Stan in his lab coat.

MIERZWIAK

Ah, Mr. Barish. This is Stan. He'll be in charge of your procedure tonight.
 

Stan nods professionally.

STAN

Mr. Barish.

JOEL

How exactly is this going to work
tonight?

As Mierzwiak talks, the room colors start to fade, Mierzwiak's tone of voice is also affected; it becomes dry and monotonous.

MIERZWIAK

We'll start with your most recent memories and go backwards -- There is an emotional core to each of our memories -- As we eradicate this core, it starts its degradation process -- By the time you wake up in the morning, all memories we've targeted will have withered and disappeared. Like a dream upon waking.

JOEL
Is there any sort of risk of brain
damage?

MIERZWIAK

Well, technically, the procedure itself is brain damage, but on a par with a night of heavy drinking. Nothing you'll miss.

Joel looks quizzically at the eroding environment. Suddenly he gets it.

JOEL
It's happening now!	I'm already in my

brain.

Mierzwiak looks at the fading room.

MIERZWIAK

Yes, I suppose you are.
(back in his faded memory
persona)

So, let's get started -- If we want the procedure underway tonight, we have some work to do.

Joel is sitting in a chair. Electrodes connect him to some electronic machinery monitored by Stan. Mierzwiak watches from the corner.

STAN
We use the articles you brought to create
 

a map of Clementine in your brain. Tonight while you sleep we'll be able to trace the map and erase.

JOEL

But you're tracing and erasing now. It's already started. I'm home in my bed.

Stan pulls a snow globe from one of Joel's bags, shows it to Joel. The equipment registers Joel's reaction.

STAN

Very good.

Stan pulls out a potato dressed as a Vegas showgirl. Joel studies it. The machines register his response.

MIERZWIAK
We'll dispose of these mementos when

we're done here.	That way you won't be
confused later by their unexplainable
presence in your home.

Stan pulls out a coffee mug with a photo of Clementine printed on it. Joel looks at the cup. The machines record his reaction.

STAN
Good.	We're getting healthy read-outs.

The room, Stan, and Mierzwiak are now vague and wispy.

STAN'S VOICE
Patrick, do me a favor --

Joel is watching Stan. Stan is not speaking, yet his voice continues.

STAN'S VOICE (CONT'D)

--	and check the voltage levels, I'm not wiping as clean as I would like here.

Joel looks up.	Stan's voice seems to be coming from above.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Joel lies on his back in fresh pajamas. His eyes are closed and electrodes connect his head to several machines. The machines are operated by Stan, now in grubby street clothes and in need of a shave, and by Patrick, dressed similarly. The monitor on one of the machines traces a myriad of light blips running like streams through an image of Joel's brain. Stan presses buttons and operates a joystick, aiming for the lines. Patrick (who we saw earlier with Clementine at the bookstore) studies a meter on one of the machines.

PATRICK
 
The voltage looks fine.

STAN
Then check the connections.

Patrick fiddles with some jacks.

PATRICK
Does that help?

STAN
Yeah, that looks better.	Thanks.

INT. LAB ROOM - DAY

The memory is becoming vague, characters' affects flat. Stan pulls out a pile of loose-leaf pages. Mierzwiak smiles.

MIERZWIAK

Ah, your journal.	This will be
invaluable.

STAN
(reading)

December 15th, 2004. I met someone tonight. Oh, Christ: I don't know what to do. Her name is Clementine and she's amazing. So alive and spontaneous and passionate and sensitive. Things with Naomi and I have been stagnant for so long.

The scene is just a shell of itself as Stan rattles on.

STAN'S VOICE
I think we got this one.	Let's push on.

Joel looks up at the ceiling.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - DAY

Joel, snapped into a new memory, cries as he fills two large plastic garbage bags with mementos of his relationship with Clementine. There are funny little gifts, wind-up toys, some potatoes dressed as women, some clothing Clementine has left there, some CD's. He pulls a big clump of pages out of his loose-leaf journal and dumps them in the bag.

He gets some clean loose-leaf paper and writes:

December 15, 2004 Nothing much happened today. I stayed home. Naomi worked on her dissertation.

The scene is fading as he continues to write.

INT. HALLWAY - DAY
 

Joel looks for an office number. He finds it. The plaque on the door reads Lacuna Ltd. Joel enters.

INT. WAITING ROOM - DAY

Joel enters the Lacuna waiting room. Mary sits in the reception area.

MARY

May I help you?

JOEL

My name is Joel Barish.	I have an
appointment.

MARY
Please have a seat.	Dr. Mierzwiak will

be right with you.

INT. OFFICE HALL - DAY

Mary leads Joel down the hall.

MARY

(without turning)
How are you today?

JOEL
Not great.

MARY
(at Mierzwiak's office)

Here we are.

Joel glimpses Mary smiling coquettishly at Mierzwiak.

INT. MIERZWIAK'S OFFICE - DAY

Joel and Mierzwiak are in the sitting area. Joel looks at the tape recorder.

MIERZWIAK

I'm sorry you saw one of our notification cards. You never should have.

JOEL
Well... I did.

MIERZWIAK

We can help you through this. Why don't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about your relationship with Clementine.

JOEL
(thinks, then:)
It was a mess.	I don't know how it got
 
this way...

PATRICK'S VOICE
It's kind of a dump, don't you think?

Joel looks up, trying to locate the voice.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Patrick is checking out the apartment. Stan monitors the equipment.

STAN
(uninterested)

It's an apartment.

PATRICK

Not a dump, then, but kind of plain.
Uninspired.	And there's a stale smell.
Sort of stuffy.	I don't know.	Stuffy.

STAN

Patrick, let's just get through this. We have a long night ahead of us.

PATRICK
Yeah.

Patrick returns to the bedside, focuses on the machines for a moment. He glances at the unconscious Joel.

PATRICK (CONT'D)

So who do you think is better-looking, me or this guy?

Stan glances sideways at Patrick.

INT. MIERZWIAK'S OFFICE - DAY

Mierzwiak sits with Joel in the sitting area.

MIERZWIAK

So we'll need you to go home and bring in everything you ever received from Clementine and anything that might remind you of her...

The scene is faded and disappearing fast.	It's gone.

INT. JOEL'S OFFICE - DAY

Joel gets off the elevator and approaches the receptionist.

JOEL

So then she just stops calling.

VOICE-OVER
 
I wasn't going to call her.	Not after
the way she was.

JOEL

Any messages, Carmen?

Carmen the receptionist shakes her head.

Next day: Joel approaches the receptionist.

JOEL (CONT'D)
Any messages for me, Carmen.

CARMEN

Nothing, Joel.

VOICE-OVER

It's bullshit.	She's punishing me for
being honest with her.

Joel is at his office desk on the phone.

PHONE MACHINE VOICE
You have no messages.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Joel enters, checks his phone machine: zero messages.

INT. JOEL'S OFFICE - DAY

Joel gets off the elevator, approaches Carmen, who is in conversation with someone else.

JOEL
Sorry, Carmen.	Any messages?

Carmen shakes her head "no", goes back to her conversation.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Joel checks his machine: zero messages.

VOICE-OVER

That's it.	I'm just gonna--

Without a moment's hesitation, he dials the phone.

VOICE-OVER (CONT'D)

I'm gonna tell her I'm through playing
games and --

RECORDED VOICE
The number you have dialed has been

disconnected.

Joel's eyes bug.
 

INT. ROB AND CARRIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Joel sits across Rob and Carrie, mid-40's.

JOEL
Why would she do that?

VAGUE RECORDED VOICE

--	If you think you have reached this recording in error, please check your number and dial again.

CARRIE

I don't know, honey.	It's horrible.

JOEL

She's punishing me for being honest.	I
should just go to her house.

ROB
I don't think you should go there, Joel.

JOEL

Yeah, I don't want to seem desperate.

CARRIE

Maybe you need to look at this as a sign to move on. Just make a clean break.

JOEL

I don't know. I'm so... I can't believe she'd be so goddamn immature!

ROB
Joel, look, the thing is --

CARRIE
(agitated, interrupting)

Joel, honey... We have to feed the dog.
Would you just wait here?	Just a second.

Joel nods, confused, as Rob and Carrie leave the room and close the door behind them. Joel hears a hushed argument ensue in the hall. He notices the dog asleep on the floor. He grabs a magazine off the coffee table, flips through it distractedly as he paces, puts it down, picks up another. A subscription card falls to the floor. He picks it up and is about to shove it back in the magazine when he sees it is not a subscription card at all. It reads:

Clementine Kruczynski has had Joel Barish erased from her

memory.	Please never mention their relationship to her
again.	Thank you.

Lacuna Ltd.
610 11th Avenue, NY, NY
 

Joel stares at the card, incredulous.

Later: Rob and Carrie are now back in the room.

CARRIE (CONT'D)
You weren't supposed to see that.

JOEL

They can't erase memories.	It's a joke.
It's a nasty Clementine hoax.

CARRIE
Sweetie, we called the company.

Joel just stands there.

Close-up of a vague dictionary page.

VOICE-OVER
Lacuna:	Noun.	A blank, a missing
portion, especially in a manuscript.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Joel is on the phone pacing.

CARRIE'S VOICE

You can't tell her, Joel. They explained that. Like waking a sleepwalker. It might have a devastating effect.

INT. JOEL'S CAR - NIGHT

Joel drives past vague local landmark.

CARRIE'S VOICE

Think about it: to be told you lived an
existence of which you have no
recollection.

JOEL'S VOICE

But what am I supposed to do?

CARRIE'S VOICE
Move on, sweetie.

JOEL'S VOICE

How can I? How can I move on when I know I'm the only one to carry this love we had? How do I do that?

INT. CAR - NIGHT

Joel in his parked car next to a fence surrounding a drive-in movie closed for the season. He weeps. The windows fog up until the outside is completely obscured.
 

EXT. NEW YORK STREET - DAY

Joel looks for an address.

INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

Joel gets off on the sixth floor. He searches for a room number. As he turns the corner, he sees that the hallway is faded, vague and mostly erased. He keeps walking, comes to the door marked Lacuna and opens it. Inside he can see vague, erased version of Mary the receptionist.

MARY

(dead monotone)
Hi, May I help you?

These degraded, faded memories allow Joel to detach himself and hear what's going on in his bedroom.

STAN'S VOICE
So, Mary's coming over tonight.

Joel looks up.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Stan works the joystick.	Patrick sits on the bed with Joel.

PATRICK
Yeah?

STAN
Just wanted to let you know.

PATRICK

I like Mary. I like when she comes to visit. I just don't think she likes me.

STAN
She likes you okay.

PATRICK

I wonder if I should invite my girlfriend over, too. I have a girlfriend now.

STAN

You can if you want.

PATRICK
Did I tell you I have a new girlfriend?

STAN
(re: memory on monitor)

This one's history.	Moving on...

PATRICK
 

The thing is ... my situation is a little weird. My girlfriend situation.

STAN

Patrick, we need to focus.

Stan aims the joystick.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Joel distractedly reads a book, checks the clock, goes back to the book. The door opens. He looks up. Clementine is staggering in, drunk.

CLEMENTINE
Yo ho ho!

JOEL
It's three.

VOICE-OVER
Shit.	The last time I saw you.

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)

Anyhoo, sweetie, I done a bad thing.	I
kinda sorta wrecked your car...

JOEL
I can't believe you wrecked my car.

JOEL
You're driving drunk.	It's pathetic.

CLEMENTINE

...a little.	I was a little tipsy.
Don't call me pathetic.

JOEL
Well it is pathetic.	And fucking

irresponsible.	You could've killed
somebody.

The scene is starting to degrade.	The acting becomes anemic.

JOEL (CONT'D)
I don't know, maybe you did kill
somebody.

CLEMENTINE

Oh Christ I didn't kill anybody.	It's
just a fucking dent.	You're like some
old lady or something.

VOICE-OVER

Right!	She called me an old lady here,
too!	And I remember, I said...
 
JOEL (CONT'D)
And what are you like?	A wino?

CLEMENTINE

A wino?	Jesus, Are you from the fifties?
A wino!
(laughs)

Face it, Joel. You're freaked out because I was out late without you, and in your little wormy brain, you're trying to figure out, did she fuck someone tonight?

JOEL

No, see, Clem, I assume you fucked someone tonight. Isn't that how you get people to like you?

This shuts Clementine up. She is stung and she starts gathering up her belongings, which are strewn about the apartment. Joel is immediately sorry he said this. He follows her around.

JOEL (CONT'D)

I'm sorry. Okay. I didn't mean that. I just... I was just... pissed, I guess.

Clementine is out the door.	Joel follows.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Joel looks at his dented car, looks at Clementine clomping off in the distance.

INT. JOEL'S CAR - CONTINUOUS

Joel drives to catch up with Clementine. He rolls down his window to talk to her.

JOEL
Let me drive you home.

CLEMENTINE
(without turning)

Fuck you, Joel.	Faggot.

JOEL

Look at it out here.	It's falling apart.
I'm erasing you.	And I'm happy.

She keeps clomping.

JOEL (CONT'D)
You did it to me.	I can't believe you

did this to me.	By morning you'll be
gone.	Ha!
 
He stops the car, gets out.

EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

It's a street you might see in a dream, more an impression of a quiet street than an actual one, with what little detail there is obscured in darkness. Joel wanders it. In the distance Clementine walks off, but as in an animated loop, she doesn't get any farther away. It's lonely.

PATRICK'S VOICE

See, remember that girl? The one we did last week? The one with the potatoes?

Joel looks up, startled.

STAN'S VOICE

Yeah, that's this guy's girlfriend.	Was.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Stan watches the screen. Patrick paces, fidgets, looks at the unconscious Joel.

PATRICK
I gotta tell you something.	I kind of
fell in love with her last night.

STAN

She was unconscious, Patrick.

PATRICK

She was beautiful.	So sweet and funky
and voluptuous.	I kind of stole a pair
of her panties, is what.

STAN

Jesus, Patrick!

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

On the vague street Joel listens to Patrick and Stan.

PATRICK'S VOICE

I know.	It's not like... I mean, they
were clean and all.

STAN'S VOICE
Look, just don't tell me this stuff.	I

don't want to know this shit.

PATRICK'S VOICE

Yeah, okay.

STAN'S VOICE
We have work to do.
 
There's a click and Joel finds himself in --

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Joel and Clementine sit and eat dinner in front of the TV.
It's hard to make out what they're watching.
They sit on opposite ends of the couch.	They look bored.

The scene quickly degenerates.	The room fades.

PATRICK'S VOICE
Okay, but there's more.

Joel listens.

PATRICK'S VOICE (CONT'D)
After we did her, I went to where she
worked and I asked her out.

Joel looks over at the faded Clementine across the couch.

She stares straight ahead at the TV.

STAN'S VOICE

Patrick... do you know how unethical...

JOEL
That must be the guy I saw you with.

VOICE-OVER

In the bookstore that night. The skinny guy.

There's a click and Joel finds himself in --

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Joel watches TV. Clementine walks by in her underwear, looks at the TV. She slips into a skirt.

CLEMENTINE

How can you watch this crap?

JOEL

Where are you going?

CLEMENTINE
I'm fucking crawling out of my skin.

The scene starts to fade. Clementine puts on her shoes and heads out the door.

EXT. ZOO - DAY

Joel and Clementine walk around unhappily. They barely look at the animals. Clementine watches parents with babies.

JOEL
Oh shit.	I remember this.
 
(to Clementine)
Want to go?

CLEMENTINE

(pissy)
I want to have a baby.

JOEL
Let's talk about it later.

CLEMENTINE
No.	I want to have a baby.	I have to

have a baby.

JOEL
I don't think we're ready.

CLEMENTINE
You're not ready.

JOEL

Clementine, do you really think you could take care of a kid?

She turns violently toward him, glaring.

CLEMENTINE

What?!

JOEL
(mumbly)
I don't want to talk about this here.

CLEMENTINE

Joel, We're fucking gonna talk about it!

Joel looks around.	People are watching.

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)

You can't fucking say something like that and say you don't want to talk about it!

JOEL
Clem, I'm sorry.	I shouldn't have --

CLEMENTINE
(screaming now)

I'd make a fucking good mother! I love children! I'm creative and smart and I'd make a fucking good mother!

The scene starts to fade. Clementine's rant continues but becomes attenuated and vague.

JOEL
Oh, thank God.	It's going.
 
CLEMENTINE

It's you! It's you who can't commit to anything! You have no idea how lucky you are I'm interested in you! I don't even know why I am! I should just end it right here, Joel. Leave you in the zoo. Maybe you could find a nice sloth to hang out with!

She's crying now, but it's almost animatronic, no real emotion in it. The scene is a husk.

JOEL

It's going, Clementine. All the crap and hurt and disappointment. It's all being wiped away.

She looks up at him.

CLEMENTINE
I'm glad.

Their eyes lock.	She is fading before his eyes.

JOEL
Me, too.

INT. BAR - NIGHT

It's noisy and crowded. Joel and Clementine sit at a small table. She is drunk and staring off, blankly.

JOEL
So, um --

CLEMENTINE
(swiveling head toward him)

Would you get me another, Joely?

Joel sighs, stands, and heads to the crowded bar.

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)

Thanky!	Thanky!

Joel is at the bar, trying to get the bartender's attention.

Joel is paying the bartender. He turns with the drink to head back to the table. He sees Clementine flirting with a man in Joel's seat.

Joel is at the table. Clementine looks from her conversation.

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)

Joel, this is Mark.	He likes my boobs.
He came over special to tell me that.
Isn't that nice.	He doesn't think I'm
 
fat.

The scene starts to fade.	Mark rises.

MARK
I didn't know she was with someone, man.

CLEMENTINE
S'okay, Mark.	Joel doesn't like my

boobs.
(stage whisper)
I don't think he likes girls.

The bar gets quiet and vague.

JOEL
You're drunk.

CLEMENTINE

You're a whiz kid.	So perceptive, so --

Clementine keeps talking but there are no more intelligible words, just a whisper -- like a breeze.

A doorbell buzzes.	Joel looks up.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Patrick opens the door. Mary stands there in a winter coat, carrying a backpack.

MARY

(coolly)
Oh, hey, Patrick.

PATRICK
Hi, Mary.	How's it going?

She walks past him.

STAN
Hey, you.

Stan and Mary kiss. She looks down at Joel as she takes off her coat.

MARY

It's freezing out.

STAN
You found us okay?

MARY
Yeah.

(re: Joel)
Poor guy.
(looking around)
 
Have anything to drink?

STAN
We haven't checked.

MARY
Well, allow me to do the honors.	It's

fucking freezing and I need something.

She heads into the kitchen. Stan turns back to monitor the slivers of light.

PATRICK
Mary hates me.	I've never been popular

with the ladies.

STAN

Maybe if you stopped stealing their
panties.

PATRICK
(guilty beat)

Okay, There's more, Stan --

Stan looks over at Patrick. Mary returns with a bottle of scotch and two glasses.

MARY
Hey, hey.

She pours the whiskey.

MARY (CONT'D)
Oh, Patrick, you didn't want any, did

you?

PATRICK

Nah, I don't know.

Mary hands a glass to Stan.	She holds hers up in a toast.

MARY

Blessed are the forgetful, for they get
the better even of their blunders.

Mary and Stan click glasses.

MARY (CONT'D)

Nietzsche. Beyond Good and Evil. Found it my Bartletts.

STAN

That's a good one.

MARY
Yeah, I can't wait to tell Howard!	It
seems really appropriate.
 

STAN

(a little sulky)
It's a good one all right.

PATRICK
What's your bartlett's?

STAN

It's a quote book.

MARY

I love quotes. So did Winston Churchill. He actually has a quotation in Bartlett's about Bartlett's. Isn't that trippy?

PATRICK

(trying to engage)
Yeah.	Cool.

MARY
"The quotations when engraved upon the

memory give you good thoughts."

PATRICK
Very cool.	Trippy.

MARY

I like to read what smart people say. So many beautiful, important things.

STAN

Yup.

MARY
Don't you think Howard's like that?
Smart?	Important?

STAN

(beat)
Yup.

PATRICK
Definitely!

MARY
I think he'll be in Bartlett's one day.

Stan focuses on the monitor. Mary pours herself another drink.

PATRICK

Definitely.

INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

It's dark.	Joel and Clementine are in bed.	The memory is
 

already in the midst of being erased. Clementine is talking in a monotonous, robotic manner.

CLEMENTINE

You don't tell me things, Joel. I'm an open book. I tell you everything. Every damn embarrassing thing. You don't trust me.

JOEL
No, it isn't that.

CLEMENTINE
I want to know you.

JOEL
I just don't have anything very

interesting about my life.

CLEMENTINE
Joel, you're a liar.

The scene is faded completely now and Joel just lies there for a moment, registering Clementine's statement.

INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Joel and Clementine eat dinner in silence. Joel looks around at other couples in the restaurant. Some seem happy and engaged. Others seem bored with each other. He turns back to his food.

JOEL
How's the chicken?

VOICE-OVER

Is that like us? Are we just bored with each other?

CLEMENTINE
Good.

He watches her as she downs her wine and pours herself another glass. She holds the wine bottle up to Joel.

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
More?

JOEL

No.	Thanks.

There's a silence.

CLEMENTINE

How's the fish?

The scene is fading.
 

JOEL

It's good.

They continue to eat in silence as the scene dissolves.

PATRICK'S VOICE

Hi, Clementine! -- Why, what's wrong? -- Oh, I'm sorry. -- Well, I'm not sure, I kind of have to study for my test --

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Patrick is on the phone next to Joel's bed. Stan watches the lights on the computer screen.

PATRICK

Hold on.	Let me ask my friend.
(covering mouthpiece)

Stan, can I leave for a little while? My girlfriend is very --

STAN
Patrick, we're in the middle of --

PATRICK
She's right in the neighborhood.	She's

upset.

Mary is in the kitchen. She pokes her head out. She's got some pie on a plate.

MARY
Let him go, Stan.	I can help.

STAN
(sighing, to Patrick)

Go.

PATRICK
(quietly)
Mary hates me.

(into phone)
I'll be right over, Tangerine.

INT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Candles are lit. Joel and Clementine are under a blanket on the living room rug listening to music.

CLEMENTINE
Joely...

JOEL

Yeah, Tangerine?

CLEMENTINE
 
Do you know The Velveteen Rabbit?

JOEL
No.

CLEMENTINE

It's my favorite book. Since I was a kid. It's about these toys. There's this part where the skin Horse tells the rabbit what it means to be real.

(crying)

I can't believe I'm crying already. He says, "It takes a long time. That's why it doesn't often happen to people who break easily or have sharp edges, or who have to be carefully kept. Generally by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby. But these things don't matter at all, because once you are Real you can't be ugly, except to people who don't understand."

She's weeping. Joel is stroking her hair. They kiss and begin to make love under the blanket. It's sweet and gentle and then it starts to fade.

JOEL

(screaming)
No!	Jesus, No!

He looks down and Clementine's tear-streaked face is fading. She continues as if she's still being made love to, even though Joel is completely beside himself. He jumps up naked and yells at the ceiling.

JOEL (CONT'D)
Please!	Please!	I've changed my mind!

(looks down at fading
Clementine, then at ceiling)

I don't want this. Wake me up! Stop the procedure! Plea --

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Joel is unconscious on the bed, completely still.	Mary and

Stan watch the monitor and smoke a joint.	After a silence:

MARY
It's amazing, isn't it?	Such a gift
Howard gave the world.

STAN

(a sigh)
Yeah.
 
MARY
To let people begin again.	It's

beautiful.	You look at a baby and it's
so fresh, so clean, so free.	And
adults... they're like this messy tangle
of anger and phobias and sadness...
hopelessness.	And Howard just makes it

go away.

STAN
You love him, don't you?

Mary seems surprised, taken aback, caught. She is silent for a long moment.

MARY
No.

(beat)

Besides, Howard's married, Stan. He's a very serious and ethical man. I'm not going to tempt him to betray all he believes in.

Stan takes another drag on the joint, passes it to Mary.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Patrick, bundled up and carrying a full backpack, trudges through the snow.

INT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

Clementine watches out the window as Patrick nears. She's crying. He makes his way up her front stairs. She swings open the door and hugs him.

PATRICK

Oh, baby, what's going on?

CLEMENTINE

I don't know. I'm lost. I'm scared. I feel like I'm disappearing. I'm getting old and nothing makes any sense to me.

PATRICK
Oh, Tangerine.

CLEMENTINE
Nothing makes any sense.	Nothing makes

any sense.

She pushes herself out of the embrace and looks at Patrick.

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)

Come up to Boston with me?

PATRICK
 
Sure.	We'll go next weekend and --

CLEMENTINE

Now. Now! I have to go now. I have to see the frozen Charles! Now! Tonight!

PATRICK

Um, okay.	I'll call my study partner.

CLEMENTINE
Yay!	It'll be great!	I'll get my shit.

She runs into the bedroom. Patrick is at the phone and realizes he doesn't know Joel's number. After a moment's thought, he *69's. The phone rings.

JOEL'S VOICE

Hi, it's Joel.	Please leave a message
after the beep.

Beep.

PATRICK
(whisper)

Stan, it's Patrick.	Pick up.

STAN'S VOICE

Hey, where are you?

PATRICK

I got into a situation with the old lady. Can you handle things tonight alone? I'm really sorry, man.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

Stan is on the phone. He's really stoned and watches Mary, stoned herself, dancing in a sexy trance to something soft and low on the stereo.

STAN
I can handle it.	He's pretty much on

auto-pilot anyway.

INT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

PATRICK

Thanks, Stan.	I owe you.

Patrick hangs up, rifles quickly through his backpack. He pulls out a silver bracelet, puts it in his pocket, then pulls out a journal, flips through it, keeping an eye on the bedroom door. The handwriting is a woman's. He finds what he's looking for. He reads:

CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
I took Joel to walk on Charles River with
 

me last night. It was so beautiful and charming. Joel was nervous about stepping onto the ice, but he wanted to please me so much -- he's so sweet --

that he came out after me. We lay down right in the center and watched the stars. He took my hand and said "I could...

EXT. CHARLES RIVER - NIGHT

Joel and Clementine lie together holding hands on the frozen river. They look up at the stars.

JOEL

...die right now, Clem. I'm just... happy. I've never felt that before. I'm just exactly where I want to be.

Clementine looks over at him. Her eyes are filled with love and tears. Then they get vague. The scene is being erased. Joel is panicked.

JOEL (CONT'D)

Clem, no!	This can't keep happening.
Please!	Oh, fuck!	Please!

Crazily, Joel runs off, passing through a series of decayed scenes: He and Clementine arguing in a car, having sex on the beach, laughing and holding hands at a movie, eating grilled cheese and tomato soup together in bed, Joel watching her sleep, them drinking at a bar. He arrives at a decayed version of his first meeting with Mierzwiak.

MIERZWIAK

We can help you through this. Why don't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about --

JOEL
You have to stop this!

MIERZWIAK
What?	What do you mean?

JOEL
I'm trapped in my head and everything I

love is being erased!	Stop it now!

MIERZWIAK
Yes, but... I'm just something you're
imagining.	What can I do?	I'm in your

head, too.

INT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Patrick reads the journal.
 

CLEMENTINE'S VOICE

... and we made love right on the ice.

It was absolutely freezing on my ass! It was wonderful.

Clementine enters, dressed for the cold. Patrick puts the notebook away.

CLEMENTINE
I'm so excited.	Yay!

PATRICK
I'm excited, too.	Oh, and I wanted to

give you this.	It's a little... thing.

Patrick pulls the bracelet from his pocket, hands it to her.

PATRICK (CONT'D)

I didn't have a chance to wrap it.

CLEMENTINE

It's gorgeous.
(slipping it on)

Just my taste. I've never gone out with a guy who brought me a piece of jewelry I liked.

(kisses him)
Thanks.	So let's get going.	Long drive.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Stan and Mary have sex on the floor next to Joel's bed.

EXT. FOREST - DAY

Joel and Clementine are hiking, Clementine in front.

CLEMENTINE

Such a beautiful view.

JOEL

(looking at her)
Yes indeed.
(snapping out of memory)
Fuck!	They're erasing you, Clem!

CLEMENTINE
Oh?

JOEL

I hired them to. We're in my brain. But I want it to stop, before I wake up and don't know you anymore.

CLEMENTINE
Wow.	Um, well... can't you just force
 
yourself awake?

JOEL
I don't know.

He concentrates.	Nothing happens.

JOEL (CONT'D)
Aaargh!	It's horrible!	I'm trapped!

He starts to have a fit, banging against trees, stomping his feet, screaming. But even while he's doing this the memory and Clementine are fading around him.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - DAY

It's raining out. Joel is reading, slouched in a chair. He looks over at Clementine, stretched out on her belly in her underwear. She's reading, too.

VOICE-OVER
She's so sexy.

JOEL

I loved you on this day.	I love this
memory.	The rain.	Us just hanging.

Clementine looks over at him, smiles. Her brow furrows in thought.

CLEMENTINE
What if you hide me?

JOEL

What do you mean?

CLEMENTINE

(formulating)

Well... if they're looking for me in memories I'm in, what if you take me to a memory I'm not in?
(proud)

And we can hide there till morning.

Joel ponders this. The scene and Clementine are beginning to dissolve. Joel grabs Clementine's hand. She giggles with glee. He pulls her out of the scene as it degrades.

JOEL

Where?	Where?	Where?

He drags her through the landscape of already decayed memories and turns off into:

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

The kitchen is dated and vague.	Joel and Clementine are in
 

an oversized playpen; they're adults but small. Joel wears footsie pajamas with some vague little animals on them. He holds a a red furry huckleberry hound doll. Clementine is still in her panties and bra. An oversized woman in high heels, seen from a low angle, hurries back and forth preparing dinner.

CLEMENTINE
Jesus.	What's this?

Joel looks around at the kitchen, at his doll, at the woman.

JOEL
I must be about two.

(oddly)

I want my mommy. She's busy. She's not looking at me.

(back to himself, re: doll) Look, my Huckleberry Hound doll! I told you about this!
(beat)
I want my mommy!

He starts to cry. Clementine tries to comfort him. She hugs him.

JOEL (CONT'D)

(crying still)
I want my mommy.
(adult, to Clementine)
I don't want to lose you, Clem.

CLEMENTINE
I'm right here.

JOEL
I'm scared.	I want my mommy.	I don't

want to lose you.	I don't want to
lose...

CLEMENTINE
Joel, Joely, look... it's not fading.

The memory.	I think we're hidden.

Joel sucks in some snot. His mother scurries back and forth clanging pots. The room is not decaying. Joel smiles.

INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Stan and Mary lie on the floor, their stoned minds wandering after sex. Stan suddenly perks up. He looks at the monitor.

STAN
It's stopped.

MARY
What?
 

STAN

Listen, it's not erasing.

He makes his way, naked, to the computer screen.

STAN (CONT'D)

It's not erasing.	He's off the screen.

MARY
Where?

STAN
I don't know.	He's not on the map.

Stan tries to break through his marijuana haze. He fiddles nervously with the equipment.

STAN (CONT'D)

I don't know what to do!	I don't know
what to do!	Crap.	Crap...

MARY
Well, what should we do?

STAN
I don't know!	I just said that!

MARY

Sor-ry
(beat)
We have to do something.	He can't wake

up half done.

STAN
Shit!

He jerks the joystick spastically. Mary, also naked, gets up and looks over his shoulder at the screen.

MARY
(definitely)

We should call Howard.

Stan turns and looks at her. He's stoned and trying to understand her motivation.

STAN
No way.	I can handle this.

MARY

This guy's only half cooked. There's no time to fuck around, Stan.

Stan tries to think.	He paces.	Mary watches him.	Finally:

STAN
 
(without making eye contact)
Okay.

He dials the phone, waits.

STAN (CONT'D)
Hello, Howard?

INT. MIERZWIAK'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

The room is dark.	A groggy Mierzwiak is in bed on the phone.
His wife lies beside him, eyes open, listening.

MIERZWIAK

Stan?	What's going on?

STAN'S VOICE

The guy we're doing? He's disappeared from the map. I can't find him anywhere.

MIERZWIAK
Okay, what happened right before he

disappeared?

STAN'S VOICE
I was away from the monitor for a second.
I had it on automatic.	I had to go pee.

MIERZWIAK

Well, where was Patrick?

STAN'S VOICE

He went home sick.

MIERZWIAK
Jesus.	All right, what's the address.

STAN'S VOICE
1062 Sherman Drive.	Apartment 1E,

Rockville Center.

Mierzwiak writes it down on a bedside not pad.	He hangs up.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Stan hangs up the phone, looks at Mary.

MARY
He's coming?

STAN
You better go.

MARY

Hell no.

She starts getting dressed.
 

MARY (CONT'D)

Shit, I'm so stoned. I don't want him to see me stoned. Stop being stoned, Mary!

She hurries into the bathroom with her bag.

MARY (CONT'D) (O.S.) (CONT'D)
God, I look like shit!	God!

Mary slams the bathroom door. Stan puts his head in his hands.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Joel and Clementine are in the playpen. Joel's oversized mother reaches down as she hurries by and pats Joel on the head.

MOTHER
How's my baby boy?

She's gone.

JOEL
I really want her to pick me up.	
It's weird how strong that desire is.

Clementine holds his hand.	He looks over at her.

CLEMENTINE

You know, we're okay. They're not finding us. You'll remember me in the morning. And you'll come to me and tell me about us and we'll start over.

JOEL

I loved you so much this day. On my bed in your panties. I remember I thought, how impossibly lucky am I to have you on my bed in your panties.

She kisses him.
