CLEMENTINE
You remember what happened next?

JOEL

I came over to the bed and you smelled so good, like you just woke up, slightly sweaty. And I climbed on the bed with you and you said something like --

CLEMENTINE

--	another rainy day.  Whatever shall we
do?
 

He laughs. She unbuttons his pajamas. They begin to make love. Joel's mother hurries around the kitchen. Joel stops, looks at Clementine.

JOEL
There's this guy!

CLEMENTINE
What?

JOEL

There's this guy. I heard him talking in my apartment. He's one of the eraser guys. And he fell for you when they were erasing you, so he introduced himself the next day as if he were a stranger and now you're dating him.

CLEMENTINE

Really?	Is he cute?

JOEL

He stole a pair of your panties while you were being erased!

CLEMENTINE

Gross! You must remember to tell me this in the morning. I'm, like, so freaked out now.

INT. CLEMENTINE'S CAR - NIGHT

It's a rust bucket.	Clementine drives through the snow.
She's crying and holding Patrick's hand.

CLEMENTINE
What's wrong with me?

PATRICK

Nothing is wrong with you.	You're the
most wonderful person I've ever met.

She glances gratefully over at him then starts to cry even harder.

INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Stan works on trying to get the signal back. His hair is combed and he's dressed neatly, looking professional but still stoned. Mary is pacing nervously to and from the window, looking out into the night. She's dressed also, and she's wearing more make-up now. Her hair is pulled up into some sort of style. Suddenly she freezes at the window.

MARY
There he is.	Oh my God.	Oh my God.	Do
I look okay?
 

She doesn't say anything.

MARY (CONT'D)

I'm still stoned.	Are you?	Crap.

She looks in the mirror.

MARY (CONT'D)

(to Joel)
Your Visine didn't do shit, fella.

The doorbell buzzes. Mary lunges for the door, then calms herself before opening it. Mierzwiak, holding an equipment bag, looks surprised.

MIERZWIAK

Mary.	What are you doing here?

STAN
She came to help, Howard.

MARY
I wanted to learn as much about the

procedure as possible, Howard.	I think
it's important for my job...to help
comfort the clientele.	You know.

Mierzwiak looks from Mary to Stan, nods, and enters. Mary closes the door. Mierzwiak crosses to the equipment.

MIERZWIAK

Let's get to the bottom of this.	Shall
we?

He sits down in front of the computer and does some fiddling.

MIERZWIAK (CONT'D)
Odd.

He fiddles some more.	Mary looks on, fascinated.

STAN
I tried that already.

MIERZWIAK
Did you try going through C-Gate?

STAN

Yeah.	Of course.

Mierzwiak ponders. He unzips his equipment bag, pulls out another laptop computer and plugs it in to the system.

MIERZWIAK
I'm going to do a Spectrum search
throughout his memory, see if anything
 
comes up.

Mierzwiak presses some more buttons. The program starts up. A much more complex and detailed human brain appears on this screen. It rotates. Eventually Mierzwiak sees a small distant light in the brain. He zeroes in on it.

MIERZWIAK (CONT'D)

Okay, here it is. I don't know why it's off the map like that, but --

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Joel is being bathed in the oversized sink by his oversized mother. Clementine sits in the water with him, laughing. The mother doesn't seem to see her.

MOTHER
Little baby getting awwwl cleean.	Awl

clean.

JOEL

(to Clementine)

I love getting bathed in the sink. It's such a feeling of security.

CLEMENTINE

(giggling)
I've never seen you happier.

The elements of the scene flash explosively away: Joel's mother, his Huckleberry Hound doll, the details of the kitchen, Clementine. Joel is thrown into:

INT. CAR - NIGHT

He sits with Clementine in the parked car, outside a drive-in movie theater. The movie on the giant screen is partially obscured by a fence. Joel and Clementine drink wine.

INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Mierzwiak looks up from the computer screen.

MIERZWIAK
Okay, we're back in.

MARY
That was beautiful to watch, Howard.

Like a surgeon or a concert pianist.

MIERZWIAK

Well, thank you, Mary.

STAN
(sighing)
You get some sleep, Howard.	I'll take it
 
from here.

MIERZWIAK
Yeah, probably a good idea.

INT. CAR - NIGHT

Clementine and Joel laugh as they try to give voice to what the characters on the screen are saying.

CLEMENTINE
But can't you see... I love you, Antoine.

JOEL

Don't call me Antoine.	My name is Wally.

CLEMENTINE

Yes, but I can't love a man named Wally.

She starts to fade. The scene starts to fade. Joel remembers their previous plan.

JOEL
They found us before.	The plan didn't

work.	I don't know what to do now.

CLEMENTINE

(mouthing to woman on screen)
Hide me somewhere deeper?	Somewhere
buried?

Joel grabs her. They run off just as the scene decays into a husk behind them.

INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Stan is back at the controls. Mierzwiak's at the door with Mary.

STAN
Howard, they've disappeared again.

MIERZWIAK
Oh dear.

MARY
I'm so sorry, Howard, you must be tired.

He nods, distractedly. She smiles to herself as he heads back to the equipment.

EXT. SCHOOLYARD - AFTERNOON

Joel, now the size of a junior high school kid and dressed accordingly, is peering around the corner of the school building toward the bike rack. Clementine is with him, dressed as she was in the parked car.
 

CLEMENTINE

Look at you, cutey!	What are we doing?

JOEL

This kid, Joe Early, is going to beat the shit out of me.

VOICE-OVER

I'm terrified. I thought if I hung around the art room long enough, he'd go home and I could get my bike.

They head toward the bike rack. Joel's is the only bike remaining.

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)

Poor Joel.

They're at the bike rack and a bunch of kids, including giant, fat Joe Early come around the corner.

JOE EARLY
Hi, Jill.

JOEL

He calls me Jill. Everyone calls me Jill after this.

The other kids laughs.

JOEL

Just shut up, Joe.	I'm going home.

JOE EARLY
I don't think so.	We're fighting.

JOEL
I don't want to fight you.

The kids start chanting, "fight, fight, fight..." Joe Early throws a wild punch that hits Joel in the side. joel falls and stays down, covering himself.

JOE EARLY
C'mon, Jill.	Get up, faggot.	C'mon.

Joel doesn't say anything. He peeks humiliated at Clementine. She's watching him. She's got a tear in her eye. She kneels down beside him, puts her arm around him.

JOEL

I'm too scared to even throw a punch.
When I tell people this story I leave
that part out.

The scene flashes violently to white and is gone.
 

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Mierzwiak is at the machine.

MIERZWIAK

We got him back. Stan, I think I'm just going to have to get through this manually. We're running late.

EXT. BEACH - DAY

It's cold. Joel and Clementine walk, all bundled up. She points at a house up the beach.

CLEMENTINE
Our house!	Our house!

She runs ahead, laughing. The scene is decaying. Joel chases after her.

JOEL

Clem, c'mon, we've got to hide you.
Remember?

He grabs her arm and yanks and they are in:

INT. BOY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

It's dark. Joel, junior high school size, is in bed masturbating. Clementine is in there, too, in her winter coat, still laughing from before. She realizes what's going on.

CLEMENTINE
(mock offended)
Joel!

JOEL

(continuing to masturbate)

I don't like it either, but I'm just trying to find horrible secret place to --

Joel's mother pops her head in the door.

MOTHER
Joel, I was just --

(sees what's going on)
Oh.	Um... I'll ask you in the morning,
honey.	Have a good night.

The mother backs out, closes the door. Joel cringes. Clementine laughs, still in the mode of the memory she was swiped from. Flash! It's all gone.

INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
 

Joel and Clementine are laughing as she blows out the candle on a slice of cheesecake in front of her. Joel hands her a small wrapped box.

JOEL
Happy Birthday.

CLEMENTINE
(unwrapping the gift)

Thanks, Joely.	A present!	Oh boy!

She pulls out the bracelet. It's the same bracelet Patrick gave her.

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
Oh, Joel.	It's beautiful!
(slip it on)

I mean, you're the first guy who ever
bought me a piece of jewelry I could
honestly say that about.

He notices she's starting to fade.

JOEL

I scoured the city for it.

CLEMENTINE

I love it!

She leans across the table to kiss him. He grabs her and runs through the decaying scene and into the vague night.

EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY

Joel is one of a group of five year olds. He holds a hammer and is poised to hit a dead bird in a red wagon. The other boys are goading him.

BOYS

C'mon, Joel, you have to.	Do it already.

Joel doesn't want to.	Clementine watches.

JOEL

I can't. I have to go home. I'll do it later.

VOICE-OVER
I didn't want to do this.	But I had to

or they would've called me a girl.

Joel miserably smashes the bird repeatedly with the hammer. Red jelly guts cover the hammer and the wagon bottom. The kids hoot.

VOICE-OVER
I can't believe I did that.	I'm so
 
ashamed.

A live bird watches from a tree. Clementine, still dressed for her birthday dinner (wearing her new bracelet), pulls Joel away from the other boys. The two of them walk down Joel's suburban street.

CLEMENTINE
It's okay.	You were a little kid.

(beat)
This is a great birthday present.
Getting to see you as a boy.

She kisses him and they walk holding hands.

JOEL
(pointing)

That's where I live.	Lived.
 

Joel looks down at her hand.
gone.	Clementine is gone.
 


It's fading. The bracelet is His childhood house is gone.

 

INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Mierzwiak works the equipment. He has located a small area of light in the brain imaging and eradicates them.

MIERZWIAK

I'm getting the hang of it. I still understand it. But I'm finding him quickly enough. I'm hopeful there won't be too much peripheral eradication.

Mary sits on the bed.

MARY
(a little giggly)

I like watching you work.

Stan sighs, grabs his coat.

STAN

I'll go out for a smoke.	If no one
minds.

MIERZWIAK
(not looking up)

That's fine, Stan.

Mary doesn't say anything. Stan huffs and is out the door. Mierzwiak continues to find and erase points of light. Mary gets up her courage to speak.

MARY

Do you like quotes, Howard?

MIERZWIAK
 
How do you mean?

MARY

Oh, um, like famous quotes. I find reading them inspirational to me. And in my reading I've come across some I thought you might like, too.

MIERZWIAK

Oh.	Well, I'd love to hear some.

Mary is thrilled, beside herself.	She tries to calm down.

MARY

Okay, um, there's one that goes "Blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders."

MIERZWIAK

Is that Nietzsche?

MARY

Yeah, yeah it is, Howard. And here I was thinking I could tell you something you didn't know.

MIERZWIAK

It's a good quote, Mary.	I'm glad we
both know it.

He smiles at her.	She's flustered, flattered.

MARY
(sputtering)

There's another one I like, I read. It's by Pope Alexander.

MIERZWIAK
Alexander Pope?

MARY
Yes, shit.	Oops, sorry!

(puts hand over mouth)

Sorry. It's just I told myself I wasn't going to say Pope Alexander and sound like a dope and then I go ahead and do it. Like I psyched myself out.

MIERZWIAK

It's no big deal.

MARY

You are such a sweetheart.

There's an embarrassed moment as that line hangs in the air.
Then Mary plunges ahead to bury it.
 
MARY (CONT'D)

Anyway, the quote goes "How happy is the blameless Vestal's lot! The world forgetting, by the world forgot: Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind! Each prayer accepted, and each wish resign'd".

She smiles, proud and embarrassed.

MIERZWIAK
That's lovely.

MARY
Really?	I thought it was appropriate

maybe.	That's all.
(beat, then quickly)

I really admire the work that you do. I know it's not proper to be so familiar but I guess since we're outside the workplace I feel a certain liberty to --

MIERZWIAK

It's fine, Mary.	I'm happy to hear it.

MARY
Okay.	Good.	Great.	Thanks.
(blurting)

I like you, Howard... an awful lot.	Is
that terrible?

Mierzwiak seems momentarily taken aback, then returns to his unflappable self.

MIERZWIAK

You're a wonderful girl, Mary.

She leans over and kisses him, then pulls away quickly.

MARY

I've loved you for a very long time. I'm sorry! I shouldn't have said that.

MIERZWIAK
I've got a wife, Mary.	Kids.	You know

that.

MARY

(suddenly weepy)
I wish I was your wife.	I wish I had
your kids.

Mierzwiak comforts her with a hug. It turns into kiss. He pulls away.

MIERZWIAK
We can't do this.
 
MARY
No you're right.	Once again.	You're a

decent man, Howard.

He smiles sadly at her.	She smiles courageously at him.

MIERZWIAK

I want you to know it's not because I'm not interested. If that means anything.

They look at each other a long while, then Howard goes back to locating and eradicating blips of lights.

EXT. JOEL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Stan sits in the van and smokes a cigarette. He has an unobstructed view into Joel's bedroom window. He watches Mierzwiak and Mary. They're talking as Howard works. It appears to be a very serious discussion. A car pulls up outside. Stan turns to see. A middle-aged woman gets out, checks the address on Joel's building, approaches the only lit window, watches Mierzwiak and Mary inside. Mierzwiak's resolve has apparently weakened and he and Mary kiss again. This time it leads to groping, partial undressing, and falling onto the bed alongside the unconscious Joel. The woman in the window is transfixed. As Mierzwiak fumbles to unzip his pants, he catches sight of the woman in the window. He practically shrieks and jumps up.

EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

Joel and Clementine walking, hand-in-hand, look up simultaneously.

INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Mary looks confusedly at Howard.

MARY

What?

She follows his eyes and sees the woman in the window, who turns and walks off in a huff.

MARY (CONT'D)
Oh my God!

Mierzwiak is already in his coat.	He's out the door.

EXT. JOEL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

The woman is at her car.	Stan watches from the van.

Mierzwiak is hurrying to the woman.

MIERZWIAK
Hollis!	Hollis!
 
HOLLIS (THE MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN)
I knew it, Howard.	I don't even know why

I bothered to copy the damn address.

MIERZWIAK

It didn't start out to be this. I came here to work. It's a one-time mistake.

Mary is right behind Mierzwiak now.	Hollis is in her car.

MARY
(heroically)

Mrs. Mierzwiak, it's true. And it's not Mr. Mierzwiak's fault. I'm a stupid little girl with a stupid little crush.
I basically forced him into it.	I swear.

Hollis turns, looks at Mary and then at Mierzwiak.

HOLLIS
Don't be a monster, Howard.	Tell the
girl.

Stan is out of the van now, listening. Mary shivers in the cold, hugs herself. There's a long silence. Then:

MARY

Tell me what?

Hollis and Mierzwiak have locked eyes. Mary looks back and forth between them. Hollis starts her car.

HOLLIS
Poor kid.	You can have him.	You did.

She drives off. Mary watches Howard with increased foreboding.

MARY

What, Howard?

MIERZWIAK

We... have a history.	I'm sorry.	You
wanted the procedure.	You wanted it
done... to get past.	I have to finish in
there.	It's almost morning.	We'll talk
later.

He shuffles inside. Mary stands there, unable to digest this, struggling in vain to remember. Stan watches.

STAN

Let me take you home.

Mary shakes her head "no."	She walks off, dazed.

EXT. CHARLES RIVER - NIGHT
 

Clementine and Patrick lie on their backs on the frozen river and look up at the night sky.

PATRICK

I could die right now, Clem. I'm just happy. I've never felt that before. I'm just exactly where I want to be.

Clementine looks over at him.	Their eyes meet.	She sobs.

CLEMENTINE

I want to go home.

She hurries toward the shore, slips on the ice, gets up, and continues, now running.

INT. COMMUTER TRAIN - NIGHT

Mary, in shock, sits in the empty fluorescent car. She tries to look out the window but can only see her own reflection.

INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

It's deathly silent as Mierzwiak and Stan work on completing the job. Mierzwiak locates a light hidden very deep in the map of Joel's brain. He targets it.

EXT. ROWBOAT - DAY

Joel, the size of a ten year old, sits fishing with his oversized father. Clementine is naked and in the boat, too. She's reading The Play by Stephen Dixon.

CLEMENTINE
I love this book, Joel.	Thank you so
much for telling me about it.

Joel is his father. The father is drunk and sullen. He faces away from Joel, looks out at the lake.

FATHER

Don't be like me, son. Don't waste your life. You'll come to a point someday where it'll be too late. You'll be sewn into your fate...

JOEL

It was horrifying, seeing my father like that.

There was no hope for me if his life was such a failure. And he saw failure in me, too, written in my future.

Clementine watches the frightened, confused Joel.

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
 
Joel, you're not sewn in.	He's wrong.

FATHER
...and there'll be nowhere to go except

where you're headed, like a train on a
track.	Inevitable, unalterable.

The scene poops out of existence with a flash of light.

INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Joel finds himself eating Chinese food and sitting across from Clementine. He is ragged and jarred.

JOEL
I'm done, Clem.	I'm just going to ride
it out.	Hiding is clearly not working.

CLEMENTINE

Yeah.

JOEL

I want to enjoy my little time left with you.

CLEMENTINE
This is our first "date" date.

JOEL

Do you remember what we talked about?

CLEMENTINE

Naomi, I guess.

JOEL
Yeah.

CLEMENTINE
What was I wearing?

JOEL
God, I should know.	Your hair was red.

I remember it matched the wallpaper.

CLEMENTINE
Egad, were you horrified?

JOEL

No! I think you were wearing that black dress, y'know, with the buttons.

She is wearing the black dress.

CLEMENTINE

No, you were with me when I bought that.
At that place on East 6th.	It was later.
 
INT. DRESS SHOP - SHOP

The scene has already been erased.	It's just a decayed husk.
A vague Joel watches a vague Clementine model a black dress.

INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Clementine wears a generic black dress now.

JOEL
Right.	Something black though.

CLEMENTINE
I'll buy that.	Black's always good.

JOEL
We did talk about Naomi.

CLEMENTINE

I said: Are you sure?	You seem unsure.

JOEL

I'm sure, I said.

CLEMENTINE
But you weren't.	I could tell.

JOEL

I was so nervous. I remember I couldn't think of anything to say. There were long silences.

There is a long silence.

JOEL (CONT'D)

I thought I was foolish. I thought I'd mistaken infatuation for love. You said:

CLEMENTINE

So what.	Infatuation is good, too.

JOEL

And I didn't have an argument.

INT. CAR - NIGHT

Joel and Clementine pull up to Clementine's house.

JOEL

I dropped you off after.	You said --

CLEMENTINE

(Mae West)
Come up and see me... now.

JOEL
It's very late.
 

CLEMENTINE

Yes, exactly.	Exactly my point.

INT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Joel and Clementine are in the midst of awkward shy sex.

JOEL

This was our first time.

The scene starts to fade.	Joel watches Clementine disappear.

INT. LACUNA RECEPTION AREA - NIGHT

Mary enters the dark room, frazzled. She flips on the fluorescent lights and searches the file folders, finds one with her name on it. Her jaw drops. With a shaky hand, she puts the tape into the player on her desk and presses "play."

MIERZWIAK VOICE
Okay, so just tell me what you remember.

And we'll take it from there.

MARY'S VOICE
(shaky)

Um, I liked you immediately. At the job interview. You seemed so... important and mature. And I loved that you were helping all these people. You didn't come on to me at all. I liked that. I was tongue-tied around you at first. I wanted you to think I was smart. You were so nice. I loved the way you smelled. I couldn't wait to come to work. I had these fantasies of us being married and having kids and just...

(starts to cry)
...and so... then... when...

that one day, when I thought you looked at me back... like... Oh, Howie, I can't do this? How can I do this?

MIERZWIAK VOICE

It's what's best, Mary.	You know that.

Mary slumps to the floor.	We move into her eyes.

MARY'S VOICE

Yeah, I know.	Oh, God.	Okay, well, I
was so excited...

A SERIES OF MURKY IMAGES.	NO DETAIL.

A flirtatious look from Mierzwiak.

MARY'S VOICE (CONT'D)
 
...Remember you bought me that little
wind-up frog?

A vague shot of a wind-up frog.

MARY'S VOICE (CONT'D)
And you said...

A vague shot of Mierzwiak mouthing to Mary's voice.

MARY'S VOICE (CONT'D)
"This is for your desk.	Just a little

token"

Back to Mary sitting on the floor, listening to the tape.

MARY'S VOICE (CONT'D)

I knew then... I knew something was going to happen... something wonderful.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Joel sits in the quiet living room.	The scene is fading.

JOEL
Naomi.

VOICE-OVER

On the couch. Dark. Quiet. I wondered if I had made a terrible mistake. I almost reached for the phone about a thousand times. I thought I could take it back, erase it, explain I had momentarily lost my mind. Then I told myself we weren't happy. That was the truth. That what we were was safe.

It was unfair to you and to me to stay in a relationship for that reason. I thought about Clementine and the spark when I was with her, but then I thought what you and I had was real and adult and therefore significant even if it wasn't much fun. But I wanted fun. I saw other people having fun and I wanted it. Then I thought fun is a lie, that no one is really having fun; I'm being suckered by advertising and movie bullshit... then I thought maybe not, maybe not. And then I thought, as I always do at this point in my argument, about dying.

INT. ROOM - DAY

An elderly man sits.

VOICE-OVER
I projected myself to the end of my life
 
in some vague rendition of my old man
self.	I imagined looking back with a

tremendous hole of regret in my heart.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Joel sits.

VOICE-OVER

I didn't pick up the phone to call you,
Naomi.	I didn't pick up the phone.

The scene dissolves.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - DAY

Namoi is red-eyed from crying. She is packing things in boxes. Joel paces, steals glances at her, doesn't know what to say. She holds up a book. The scene starts to fade.

NAOMI
Yours?

JOEL

You take it.	I don't know.

She tosses it in a box.

JOEL (CONT'D)

Naomi, I really value our relationship.
I hope it's possible for us to stay in
touch.

NAOMI

Don't do this to me now, Joel.	Really.

INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - DAY

Joel watches out the window as Naomi stuffs a final box in the trunk of a car. There's another woman down there with her. They get into the car and drive off.

INT. BORDER'S BOOKSTORE - NIGHT

Joel talks to Clementine.	The scene is fogging over.

JOEL

I told her today I need to end it.

CLEMENTINE
Is that what you want?

JOEL
I did it.	I guess that means something.

Clementine shrugs.	The scene fades.
 
EXT. PARK - DAY

Joel walks with Naomi.

NAOMI
So what's going on, Joel?

JOEL
I don't know, I've just been thinking,

maybe we're not happy with each other.

NAOMI

What?

JOEL
Y'know, we've been, I don't know, sort
of, unhappy with each other and --

NAOMI

Don't say "we" when you mean "you."

JOEL

I think maybe, we're both so used to operating at this level that -- How can one person be unhappy? If one person is unhappy, both have to be... by definition.

NAOMI

Bullshit.	Who is it?	You met someone.

JOEL

No.	I just need some space, maybe.

NAOMI

The thing is, Joel, whatever it is you think you have with this chick, once the thrill wears off, you're just going to be Joel with the same fucking problems.

JOEL
It's not somebody else.

VOICE-OVER

I hate myself.

Naomi walks off.	Joel watches her.	The scene fades.

INT. BORDER'S BOOKSTORE - NIGHT

Joel enters, looks around.	There's no sign of Clementine.
Joel approaches a male employee.

JOEL

Is there a Clementine who works here?

MALE EMPLOYEE #1
 
(calling to another male
employee)

Mark, is Clem on tonight?

MALE EMPLOYEE #2
On my dick, bro.

(turns, sese Joel, embarrassed) Oh, hey. Yeah, I think she's upstairs in Philosophy.

Joel climbs stairs, searches the aisle, spots Clementine.

JOEL
Hi.

She turns.

CLEMENTINE

I didn't think you'd show your face around me again. I figured you were humiliated. You did run away, after all.

JOEL

Sorry to track you down like this. I'm not a stalker. But I needed to see you.

CLEMENTINE

(seemingly uninterested)
Yeah?

JOEL
I'd like to... take you out or something.

CLEMENTINE

Well, you're married.

JOEL

Not yet.	Not married.

CLEMENTINE

Look, man, I'm telling you right off the bat, I'm high maintenance. So I'm not going to tiptoe around your marriage or whatever it is you got going there. If you want to be with me, you're with me.

JOEL

Okay.

CLEMENTINE

So make your domestic decisions and maybe we'll talk again.

She goes back to stacking.	Joel stands there helplessly.

JOEL
I just think that you have some kind
 

of... quality that seems really important to me.

The scene is disintegrating. Clementine's speech is delivered without passion.

CLEMENTINE

Joel, I'm not a concept. I want you to just keep that in your head. Too many guys think I'm a concept or I complete them or I'm going to make them alive, but I'm just a fucked-up girl who is looking for my own peace of mind. Don't assign me yours.

JOEL
I remember that speech really well.

CLEMENTINE

(smiling)
I had you pegged, didn't I?

JOEL
You had the whole human race pegged.

CLEMENTINE
Probably.

JOEL

I still thought you were going to save
me.	Even after that.

CLEMENTINE
I know.

JOEL

It would be different, if we could just give it another go around.

CLEMENTINE
Remember me.	Try your best.	Maybe we
can.

The scene is gone.

INT. ROB AND CARRIE'S CAR - NIGHT

Joel sits forlornly in the back seat. Rob drives and Carrie sits in the front passenger seat. The car stops in front of Joel's apartment building.

JOEL

Thanks, guys.

CARRIE
I hope you feel better, sweetie.
 
JOEL
Yeah.

CARRIE

Say hi to Naomi.

The car door closes.

INT. BUILDING STAIRWAY - NIGHT

Joel climbs the stairs.

VOICE-OVER
I hope she's not up.	I need to think.

INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

The lights are off. Joel sits on a chair near the window, writing in his journal. The streetlight illuminates the paper. Naomi sleeps in the bed.

VOICE-OVER

I met someone tonight at a party on the beach. Her name is Clementine. There is something alive about her.

Naomi turns over in bed, sees Joel.

NAOMI

(full of sleep)
Hi.

JOEL
Hi.

NAOMI
How was it?

JOEL

You didn't miss much.	Rob Carrie say
hello.

NAOMI
Hi, Rob and Carrie.

JOEL
Go back to sleep.

The room is starting to decompose.

NAOMI
Yeah.	Come to bed.	I'm cold.

JOEL

In a minute.

Naomi turns over.	Joel goes back to his writing.
 

VOICE-OVER

(more and more emotionless)

I don't know what to do about this. I've been feeling so alienated and numb lately. Forever. The thought of not acknowledging my feelings again seems self-destructive.

How can I continue on this path toward a living death, a life filled with obligation and guilt and responsibility but joyless, hopeless? I need to speak with Clementine.

The scene has turned to a husk.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON

Joel is at his closet, putting on a sweater. Naomi is at the dining room table, papers spread out before her, writing. Joel turns and watches her for a moment.

JOEL
So you don't mind?

NAOMI
I've got to finish this chapter anyway.

The scene is fading.

JOEL
Okay.	I wish you could come.

VOICE-OVER

This is it.	The night we met.	My God,
it's over.

NAOMI (CONT'D)
Me, too.

He approaches Naomi, kisses her on the top of the head. She continues to write.

NAOMI (CONT'D)

Say hi to Rob and Carrie.	Have some fun!

JOEL

I hope you get your work done.

NAOMI
(sighing)
Yeah.

INT. ROB AND CARRIE'S CAR - NIGHT

Rob drives. Carrie fiddles with the radio dial in the front passenger seat. Joel sits in the back.
 

CARRIE

I'm sorry Naomi couldn't make it.	You
okay?	You seem quiet.

JOEL
Just a little overworked, maybe.

VOICE-OVER

The trip to the party where I met
Clementine.	My first memory of her is
now my last memory of her.

Joel looks out the window. Carrie turns around and says something to Joel. She is backlit, her hair a halo of frizz.

JOEL

I remember you turned around. Your face was dark and your hair was backlit -- I could see a halo of frizz -- you asked me if things were okay between Naomi and me.

CARRIE
I did.	You said, things were fine.

JOEL
I remember.

CARRIE

This is the night you met Clementine, Joel. I remember watching you walk down the beach with her and I thought, oh shit.

JOEL
Yeah, you told me that later.

CARRIE
I told you that later.

Joel looks out he window. He sees the husk of a memory on the darkened roadside. It's Joel and Carrie in:

INT. ROB AND CARRIE'S KITCHEN - DAY

Faded.	Carrie and Joel sit at the table with coffee.

CARRIE
Who was the girl you walked off with?

JOEL
No one.

EXT. BEACH PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Rob, Carrie, and Joel emerge from the car, parked amidst a small cluster of cars in an otherwise empty parking lot.
 

EXT. BEACH - NIGHT

Joel watches his shoes in the sand as he trudges along.

CARRIE
Is this the right way?

EXT. BEACH - MOMENTS LATER

Joel, Rob, and Carrie step out of the brush and see a bonfire down the beach. People and music can be heard.

EXT. BEACH - LATER

Joel sits on a log, a paper plate of chicken and corn on his lap. People warm themselves at the fire. Joel watches couples talking, kissing, Rob sharing a joint with a guy.

JOEL

You were down by the surf. I could just make you out in the dark.

Joel looks down to the water. There's Clementine, in her orange hooded sweatshirt, looking out to sea.

JOEL (CONT'D)

Your back to me. In that orange sweatshirt I would come to know so well and even hate eventually. At the time I thought, how cool, an orange sweatshirt.

VOICE-OVER

I remember being drawn to you even then. I thought, I love this woman because she's alone down there looking out at the black ocean.

JOEL (CONT'D)

But I went back to my food. The next thing I remember, I felt someone sitting next to me and I saw the orange sleeve out of the corner of my eye.

A shot of the orange sleeve.	Joel looks up.

CLEMENTINE

Hi there.

JOEL
Hi.

VOICE-OVER
I was so nervous.	What were you doing

there, I wondered.	Your hair was lime
green.	Green revolution.
 
A shot of her green hair.

JOEL
You said...

CLEMENTINE

I saw you sitting over here. By yourself. I thought, thank God, someone normal, who doesn't know how interact at these things either.

JOEL

Yeah.	I don't ever know what to say.

CLEMENTINE
I can't tell you how happy I am to hear
that.	I mean, I don't mean I'm happy

you're uncomfortable, but, yknow... I'm
such a loser.	Every time I come to a
party I tell myself I'm going to be
different and it's always exactly the
same and then I hate myself after for

being such a clod.

JOEL

Even then I didn't believe you entirely. I thought how could you be talking to me if you couldn't talk to people?

VOICE-OVER

But I thought, I don't know, I thought it was cool that you were sensitive enough to know what I was feeling and that you were attracted to it.

CLEMENTINE

But, I don't know, maybe we're the normal ones, y'know? I mean, what kind of people do well at this stuff?

VOICE-OVER
And I just liked you so much.

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)

You did?	You liked me?

JOEL

You know what I did.

CLEMENTINE
Yeah, I know.	I'm fishing.

JOEL
You said --

She picks a drumstick off of Joel's plate.
 
CLEMENTINE

I'm Clementine. Can I borrow a piece of your chicken?

JOEL

And you picked it out of my plate before I could answer and it felt so intimate like we were already lovers.

JOEL (CONT'D)
I remember --

VOICE-OVER
The grease on your chin in the bonfire

light.

Shot of a smudge of chicken grease on Clementine's chin.

CLEMENTINE

Oh God, how horrid.

JOEL

I'm Joel.

VOICE-OVER
No, it was lovely.

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
Hi, Joel.	So no jokes about my name?

JOEL
You mean, like...

(singing)
Oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', oh, my
darlin', Clementine... ?	Huckleberry
Hound?	That sort of thing?

CLEMENTINE
Yeah, like that.

JOEL

Nope. No jokes. My favorite thing when I was a kid was my Huckleberry Hound doll. I think your name is magic.

She smiles.

CLEMENTINE
(eyes welling)

This is it, Joel.	It's gonna be gone
soon.

JOEL
I know.

CLEMENTINE
What do we do?
 

JOEL

Enjoy it.	Say good-bye.

She nods.

Joel and Clementine are walking near the surf.

JOEL (CONT'D)

So you're still on the Zoloft?

VOICE-OVER

Next thing I remember we were walking
down near the surf.

CLEMENTINE

No, I stopped. I didn't want to feel like I was being artificially modulated.

JOEL
I know what you mean.	That's why I
stopped.

CLEMENTINE

But my sleeping is really fucked up.

JOEL

I don't think I've slept in a year.

CLEMENTINE

You should try Xanax. I mean, it's a chemical and all, but it works... and it works just having it around, knowing that it's there. Like insurance.

JOEL
yeah?

CLEMENTINE

I'll give you a couple.	See what you
think.

JOEL
Okay.

CLEMENTINE
Have you ever read any Anna Akhmatova?

JOEL

I love her.

CLEMENTINE

Really? Me, too! I don't meet people who even know who she is and I work in a book store.

JOEL
 
I think she's great.

CLEMENTINE
Me too.	There's this poem --

JOEL
Did this conversation come before or

after we saw the house?

CLEMENTINE
I think, before.

JOEL
Seems too coincidental that way.

CLEMENTINE
Yeah, maybe.

Joel and Clementine wander near some beach houses closed for the winter.

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)

Do you know her poem that starts "Seaside gusts of wind,/And a house in which we don't live...

JOEL

Yeah, yeah.	It goes "Perhaps there is
someone in this world to whom I could
send all these lines"?

CLEMENTINE

Yes!	I love that poem.	It breaks my
heart.	I'm so excited you know it.
(pointing to houses)
Look, houses in which we don't live.

Joel chuckles appreciatively.

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
I wish we did.	You married?

JOEL
Um, no.

CLEMENTINE
Let's move into this neighborhood.

Clementine tries one of the doors on a darkened house. Joel is nervous.

JOEL

I do sort of live with somebody though.

CLEMENTINE
Oh.
 
She walks to the next house, tries the door.

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
Male or female?

JOEL
Female.

CLEMENTINE

At least I haven't been barking up the
wrong tree.

She finds a window that's unlatched.	She lifts it.

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
Cool.

JOEL
What are you doing?

CLEMENTINE
It's freezing out here.

She scrambles in the window.	Joel looks around, panicked.

JOEL
(whisper)

Clementine.

VOICE-OVER
I couldn't believe you did that.	I was
paralyzed with fear.

The front door opens and Clementine stands there beckoning.

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)

C'mon, man. The water's fine. Nobody's coming here tonight, believe me. This place is closed up. Electricity's off.

JOEL
I hesitated for what seemed like forever.

CLEMENTINE

I could see you wanted to come in, Joel.

He walks cautiously toward the door.

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)

As soon as you walked in.	I knew I had
you.	You knew I knew that, right?

INT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Joel enters the darkened and Clementine closes the door behind him.
 
JOEL
I knew.

CLEMENTINE

I knew by your nervousness that Naomi wasn't the kind of girl who forced you to criminally trespass.

JOEL

It's dark.

CLEMENTINE

Yeah.	What's your girlfriend's name?

JOEL
Naomi.

She's searching through drawers for something. She pulls out a flashlight, shines it in Joel's face.

CLEMENTINE
Ah-ha!	Now I can look for candles,

matches, and the liquor cabinet.

JOEL
I think we should go.

CLEMENTINE
No, it's our house!	Just tonight --

(looking at envelope on
counter)

--	we're David and Ruth Laskin. Which one do you want to be? I prefer to be Ruth but I'm flexible.

(opens cabinet)

Alcohol! You make drinks. I'm going find the bedroom and slip into something more Ruth. I'm ruthless at the moment.

She runs upstairs, giggling. The room is drying out, turning into a husk.

JOEL
(calling after her)

I really should go.	I really need to
catch my ride.

VOICE-OVER

I didn't want to go. I was too nervous. I thought, maybe you were a nut. But you were exciting. You called from upstairs.

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
(flat)

So go.

JOEL
 

I did. I walked out the door. I felt like I was a scared little kid. I thought you knew that about me. I ran back to the bonfire, trying to outrun my humiliation. You said, "so go" with such disdain.

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
(poking her head downstairs)

What if you stay this time?

JOEL

I walked out the door.	There's no more
memory.

CLEMENTINE
Come back and make up a good-bye at

least.	Let's pretend we had one.

Clementine comes downstairs, vague and robotic, making her way through the decaying environment.

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
Bye, Joel.

JOEL
I love you.

She smiles.	They kiss.	It fades.

CLEMENTINE
I --

EXT. BEACH - NIGHT

Joel finds himself hurrying back to the bonfire. This scene, too, is disintegrating. It dries up and Joel is just standing there on a faded beach at night, the bonfire frozen in the distance like a photograph.

INT. CAR - NIGHT

Joel sits in the back seat, Rob and Carrie are in the front.

CARRIE
Did you have fun?

Joel nods glumly.

Carrie continues to talk, but her voice goes under as Joel studies the faded husks of memories, piled like refuse outside the moving car window. He sees dried-out version of previous interactions with Clementine playing out in loops. He looks back and sees the memory of his ride home from the beach with Rob and Carrie. It, too, is decaying. Soon all has crumbled into dust. Everything goes black.
 
INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

Howard watches the monitor. The last specks of light are fading. It grows dark. He is tired, his eyes are hollow. He turns to Stan, who is staring out the window at the dawn.

HOWARD

Okay.

Stan turns and wordlessly begins the clean-up. He pulls the electrodes off of Joel's scalp, coils cable, packs bags. Howard dials the bedside phone. He waits as it rings.

HOLLIS'S VOICE

Hi, you've reached the Mierzwiaks.	We
can't come to --

Howard hangs up.

EXT. JOEL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - EARLY MORNING

Stan and Howard load the last of the equipment into the back of the van. He and Howard look at each other.

STAN
So, I've got to drop the van off.

MIERZWIAK
Thanks, Stan.	Thanks.

INT. PATRICK'S CAR - EARLY MORNING

Patrick and Mary are heading home from Boston. Mary is silent and depressed. Patrick tries to break the silence.

PATRICK
You want to stop for coffee or something?

Mary shakes her head "no."	Long silence.

PATRICK (CONT'D)
Well, it was sure beautiful on that

river.	Thanks for sharing it with me.

Mary doesn't say anything.	Silence.

PATRICK (CONT'D)

Well do it again soon.

EXT. PARKING STRUCTURE - EARLY MORNING

Stan pulls the van into space marked "Lacuna." He gets out, crosses to his car. Mary is sitting on the hood.

STAN
Hey.
 
MARY
(beat)

Do you swear you didn't know?

STAN
I swear.

MARY

And you never even suspected? Never saw us behaving in any unusual way together?

STAN

Once, maybe.

She watches him closely, waiting for him to continue.

STAN (CONT'D)

It was here. At his car. I was coming back from a job and spotted you together. You seemed caught. I waved. You giggled.

MARY
How did I look?

STAN
(beat)

Happy.	Happy with a secret.

Mary starts to cry.

MARY

And after that?

STAN
I never saw you together like that again.
So I figured I was imagining things.

Mary says nothing.

STAN (CONT'D)
I really like you, Mary.	You know that.

MARY

Do you remember anything else? What I was wearing? Was I standing close to him? Was I leaning against his car like I owned it? How did he look at me when I giggled? Tell me everything.

STAN
(thinking)

You were in red.	That red sweater with
the little flowers, I think.	You were
leaning against his car.
(thinking)
He looked a little like a kid.	Kind of
 

goofy and wide-eyed. I'd never seen him look like that before. Happy. You looked beautiful. You looked in love.

MARY
(heading toward the levator)
Thanks, Stan.

She stops but doesn't turn to face him.

MARY (CONT'D)
You're nice.

(beat)

But I love him. I knew I loved him. Now I know.

He nods.	She waves, heads to the elevator.

INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - MORNING

Joel awakens. The apartment is neat, like when he went to sleep. He gets out of bed and heads into the bathroom.

EXT. COMMUTER TRAIN STATION - MORNING

Joel waits on the crowded platform. The platform across the tracks is empty. Joel's train arrives. It's packed. He squeezes on with all the other commuters.

INT. OFFICE - DAY

Joel works in his cubicle over the light table. He seems distracted. He dials his phone. He's nervous.

JOEL

Hi... Naomi? Yeah, hi! How are you? I know, I know. It's been a long time. Not too much. You? Oh, that's great! Congratulations! Maybe I could buy you dinner to celebrate? Tonight? I'm free. Okay, good!

INT. LACUNA RECEPTION AREA - DAY

Mary does paperwork at her desk. She looks through her reception window at the sad people waiting in the lobby with their bags of stuff.

INT. MIERZWIAK'S OFICE - CONTINUOUS

Mierzwiak dials his phone and waits. He hangs up. Mary enters with the papers.

MARY

I need this signed, Howard.

He takes it, unable to make eye contact.	He signs it, hands
 
it back.

MARY (CONT'D)
Thanks.

(beat)
So... do we talk about this... or what?

MIERZWIAK
I don't know what I'm supposed say, Mary.

I want to do the right thing here.

MARY

Do you love me? Did you love me? Something. I listened to my tape. I can't believe I've been sitting right in front of it for a year. It's like listening to someone else's story. I mean, I hear myself talking about having sex with you and I can't even imagine you naked. I can't even say "naked" to you!

MIERZWIAK

I have a family, Mary.

MARY
You made me have an abortion.

MIERZWIAK
It was a mutual decision.

MARY
You made me have you erased!	I loved

you.	I love you!	How could you --

MIERZWIAK
I didn't make you.	You thought it best.
(off her stare)

But, look, I take full responsibility.

She looks at him for a long while. Then, out of frustration, she screams.

INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Joel sits across from Naomi.

NAOMI

(oddly cautious)
So... you haven't been involved with
anyone in all this time?

JOEL

It's been a pretty lonely couple of
years.

NAOMI
I'm sorry.
 

JOEL

Well, it was my fault -- the break-up.
I'm sorry.

NAOMI
Oh, sweetie.	It really does cut both

ways.	We were taking each other for
granted and --

JOEL
I miss you.

NAOMI

Miss you, too.
(awkward pause)
I have been seeing someone for a little

while.

JOEL
(trying for enthusiasm)
Oh!	Great.	That's great!

NAOMI

A religion instructor at Columbia.	A
good guy.	He's a good guy.

JOEL
I'm sorry.	I really shouldn't have --

NAOMI
I'm glad you called.

INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Joel and Naomi are in bed having sex. There are certain sexual routines, habits, they have fallen back into almost immediately. She sticks her tongue in his ear in a way that's trying to be sexual but just feels embarrassing to him. They finish and lie there.

JOEL

So you think the dissertation will get
published?

NAOMI

I don;t know. I'm not sure there's a big public demand for books on Calvinism and Misogyny.

INT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Clementine lies in bed with Patrick.

EXT. COMMUTER TRAIN STATION - MORNING

The platform is crowded with business commuters.	Joel is
 
among them.

The platform across the tracks from them is empty. Suddenly, Joel turns and makes his way through the crowd. He climbs the stairs, crosses the overpass and makes his way to the empty platform. An almost empty train pulls into that platform. Joel gets on the train and watches the business commuters through the dirty window as his train pulls out of the station.

INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - MORNING

Mary gets out of bed. She has been crying all night. She's a wreck. She puts on some coffee then crosses into the living room area. Sitting there are piles of the files from work. She pulls the top one out, copies the name and address onto an envelope stuffs the file and tape cassette in. She pulls another file out. This one has Joel's name on it. She copies it onto an envelope.

INT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Joel says goodbye to Clementine.

CLEMENTINE

So you'll call me, right?

JOEL

Yeah.

CLEMENTINE
When?

JOEL
Tomorrow?

CLEMENTINE
Tonight.	Just to test out the phone

lines.

JOEL
Yeah.

Joel exits. We stay on Clementine as she watches Joel head to his car, tromping through the snow.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Joel enters, drops his overcoat on a chair, dials the phone.

JOEL
Hi, Naomi, it's Joel.

NAOMI'S VOICE
Hi.

JOEL
How's it going?
 

NAOMI'S VOICE

Good. I called you at work today. They said you were home sick.

JOEL
I know.	I had to take the day to think.

NAOMI'S VOICE

Yeah, I tried you at home.	Did you get
my message?

JOEL
I just got in.

NAOMI'S VOICE
Long day thinking.

Joel flips on messages with volume down.

JOEL
Yeah, I suppose so.

NAOMI ON MACHINE

(cheerful)
Hi.	They told me you were sick!	So...
Where are you?!	I had a really nice time

last night.	Just wanted to say hi, so...
hi.	Call me.	I'm home.	Call me!

NAOMI'S VOICE
That's me.

JOEL

There you are.
(pause)

Naomi, it's just... I'm afraid if we fall back into this fast without considering the problems we had...

NAOMI
Okay, Joel.	I suppose you're right.

JOEL

I had a good time last night.	I really
did.

NAOMI

So I'm going to get some sleep. I'm glad you're okay.

JOEL

We'll speak soon.

NAOMI
'Night.
 

She hangs up and Joel stands there for a minute feeling creepy, then he dials the number on a piece of paper.

CLEMENTINE'S VOICE

What took you so long?

JOEL

I just walked in.

CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
Hmmm.	Do you miss me?

JOEL
Oddly enough, I do.

CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
Ha Ha!	You said, I do.	I guess that

means we're married.

JOEL
I guess so.

CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
Tomorrow night... honeymoon on ice.

EXT. CHARLES RIVER - NIGHT

Clementine steps out onto it.	Joel follows nervously.

CLEMENTINE

Don't worry. It's really solid this time of year.

JOEL

I don't know.

She takes his hand and he is suddenly imbued with confidence.

JOEL (CONT'D)

This is so beautiful.

She squeezes his hand.

CLEMENTINE

Isn't it?

She runs and slides on the ice.	Joel is by himself now.

JOEL

I don't know.	What if it breaks?

CLEMENTINE

What if?

Clementine lies on her back and stares up at the stars. Joel is paralyzed. He looks back at the shore.
 
JOEL
I think I should go back.

CLEMENTINE

Joel, come here.	Please.

He hesitates then gingerly makes his way over to her. She reaches for his hand and gently pulls him down. He lies on his back beside her, their bodies touching. He wants to turn to her, but out of shyness, doesn't. She holds his hand. They look up at the stars. She smiles, doesn't say anything and snuggles closer to him.

JOEL

Listen, did you want to make love?

CLEMENTINE

Make love?

JOEL
Have sex.	Y'know --

CLEMENTINE
Oh, um...

JOEL

Because I just am not drunk enough or stoned enough to make that happen right now.

CLEMENTINE
That's okay.	I --

JOEL

I'm sorry.	I just wanted to say that.
This seems like the perfect romantic
exotic place to do it and --

CLEMENTINE

Hey, Joel --

JOEL

--	and I'm just too nervous around you right now.

CLEMENTINE
I'm nervous, too.

JOEL

Yeah?	I wouldn't have thought that.

CLEMENTINE

Well, you obviously don't know me.

JOEL
I'm nervous because I have and enormous
crush on you.
 

She smiles up at the sky.

CLEMENTINE

Show me which constellations you know.

MONTAGE

We see people going to their mailboxes, finding manila envelopes. One by one they open the envelopes and pull out tapes. We see stunned, confused, disbelieving reactions as people listen to their tapes.

EXT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - DAY

Joel drops Clementine off.	She kisses him.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - A FEW MINUTES LATER

Joel enters with his mail. He opens a manila envelope, reads the enclosed file, sticks the cassette tape in his stereo, listens. Joel dials the phone.

CLEMENTINE'S VOICE

Yeah?

JOEL

Did you send this?	Is it a joke?

CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
I probably got the same thing as you.

JOEL

I mean, I haven't even told anyone I've met you. Who would even know to do this?

CLEMENTINE'S VOICE

(matter of fact)
Maybe it's true then.	It's my voice on
the tape.

JOEL

That's what you have to say?	How could
it be true?	I never even heard of any
procedure like this.	It's a joke.

CLEMENTINE

Maybe.	Call someone who'd know.

MONTAGE

We see the people we saw opening envelopes, now on the phone. We hear over and over: "Is this true?", "Did this really happen?", "Do I know you?", "Is it true?"

INT. ROB AND CARRIE'S KITCHEN - DAY
 
Carrie is on the phone.	She pauses nervously, then speaks:

CARRIE

Yes, Joel. It is true. We weren't supposed to say anything. They say it's like waking a sleepwalker.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

Joel hangs up.	He dials the phone.

JOEL

It's true.

CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
I know.	I spoke to my friend Magda.

Joel is immersed in the several page document.

JOEL
Look, I have to go.	I have to think.

CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
Joel, we've fucked.	We've made love.

Like a million times.	And we were so
sweet and shy and inept with each other
last night.	Isn't that lovely?

Joel doesn't know what to say as this registers. He just stands there dumbly.

CLEMENTINE'S VOICE (CONT'D)

Come over here, sweetheart.	Please.

INT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - LATER

Joel and Clementine review their separate Lacuna packages together.

CLEMENTINE
Says you were closed off, non
communicative, never told me what you

were feeling.

JOEL
Says you were a bully...

CLEMENTINE
(laughing)

A bully?	Moi?

JOEL

That's what it says. You drank too much, you picked on me for being passive and timid.

CLEMENTINE
 
Well, sounds like me.	Sorry, man.
(reading)

Says you were jealous and suspicious.

JOEL

Says you would sometimes disappear all night, then brag to me about your sexual conquests.

CLEMENTINE

Did I use the term "sexual conquests" or is that your way of putting it.

JOEL

I don't know.

CLEMENTINE

Doesn't sound like me.

JOEL
Says you were a slob, leaving trails of
panties and dirty socks in your wake.

CLEMENTINE

Says you were constantly calling me a
slob.
(laughs)

It's sexy that we were like a married couple, griping and overly-familiar and bored. Don't you think?

JOEL

(considering)
I sort of do.	But I only see it as a
fantasy version of reality.	Cleaned up
enough to be erotic.

CLEMENTINE
We should have sex.	It's old hat for us.

She smiles at nervous Joel.

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
You know my body like the back of your

hand.

She unbuttons her blouse.

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)

Every curve, every freckle.

She takes off her shirt. He stares at her. He has clearly never seen this body before.

JOEL
You're so beautiful.
 

She approaches him, kisses him, his arms wrap around her waist for the first time.

INT. LACUNA LTD. WAITING ROOM - MORNING

Stan enters the waiting room, now crowded with people holding their files, a stunned-looking lot. There is a new woman in the reception window. The file cases behind her are bare.

RECEPTIONIST
May I help you?

STAN

I work here. I used to work here. Stan. Please just tell Howard I'm here to clean out my desk.

RECEPTIONIST
(into phone)

Mr. Mierzwiak, Stan is here to -- Yes
sir.
(to Stan)

He says he needs to see you.

INT. MIERZWIAK'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

Stan enters.	Mierzwiak is pale and pacing.

MIERZWIAK

She should not have done this, Stan. As mad as she was... as justifiably --

STAN
I don't know what you're talking about,

Howard.

MIERZWIAK

Mary has stolen our files and is sending them back to people.

STAN
Jesus.

Mierzwiak turns up the volume on a small video monitor looking in on the lab, where Patrick has clearly taken over Stan's position. He is in the process of interviewing a sad young woman.

YOUNG WOMAN

... so I called everybody I know and asked them to tell me everything. Now I know my entire history with him, but it's in the form of a story, I'm losing my mind.

MIERZWIAK
This is why people must never be told.
 
It's like waking a --

YOUNG WOMAN
I don't know what to do.	Before I

thought I was depressed for no reason.
Now it's like I've been assigned a
reason.

PATRICK

This never should've happened, ma'am.
We'll take care of it.

MIERZWIAK

I know you don't like me much, Stan, but please talk to Mary. She of all people should know this is a dangerous thing she's doing.

INT. OFFICE - DAY

Joel works over his light box.	His phone rings.

JOEL
Hi, it's Joel.

CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
Hey, lover.	Whatcha doing?

JOEL

I'm just, y'know, passing the time best I can till I can see you.

CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
God, I can't believe I ever hated you.

JOEL
You must have been crazy.

CLEMENTINE'S VOICE

Guess what I'm wearing.

JOEL

I don't know.	Panties and --

CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
Your dried cum.

JOEL
Jesus.

CLEMENTINE

You're still excited by my irreverence. You haven't yet started to think of it as my "gratuitous need to shock."

JOEL
I can't stop thinking about you.
 

CLEMENTINE

Yay.	Meet me after work by the old mill.

JOEL
What old mill?	Is that somewhere we --

CLEMENTINE
I just wanted to say that.	Come by my

house.

INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - DAY

Mary opens the door. Stan stands there with two cups of take out coffee.

MARY

Oh.

STAN
Hi.

MARY
What do you want, Stan?

STAN
Can I... I brought some --

She steps aside for Stan to enter. He does, looks around, sees the tapes and the stuffed envelopes on the floor.

STAN (CONT'D)

What's this?

MARY
Nothing.

STAN
I know what it is.

MARY
Then why did you ask me?

STAN

I don't know. I just -- there are a lot of really confused people showing up at the office.

MARY

They have a right to know. Howard is a thief. He steals the truth.
(suddenly weeping)

I can't remember my baby! I can't remember my baby. It existed and I can't even remember. Do you understand that?

Stan doesn't know what to say.	He stands there dumbly.	Mary
 
slumps into a ball on a chair.

STAN
Mary, people come to him voluntarily.

MARY

I won't allow it. Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. What do you think of that? That's from my quote book.

STAN

The office is filled with people who want their memories re-erased.

MARY
(hysterically)

Remember the Alamo!	Remember the Alamo!

STAN
Mary... please.	This is hurting people.

Long pause, then:

MARY
(small)
I don't want to hurt people.

(breaking down)

But these things happened! All these little sadnesses, the big ones. What if no one remembers? What does that do to the world?

(beat, quietly)
Someone has to remember, Stan.

They look at each other.

EXT. PARK - AFTERNOON

Vague elliptical images of a young girl on a swig.

SAD WOMAN'S VOICE

I was by myself in the park because my friend Davia was sick that day. I was on a swing. There was this smiling man walking a little bushy dog --

Vague shots of a man smiling, a scruffy dog on a leash.

SAD WOMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D)
The man said something like, "He's
friendly --"

Vague shot of the man, his voice overlapping with the woman's.

SAD WOMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D)
 
"-- he won't bite."

MAN
He won't bite.	You can pet him if you

want...

Shot of the girl petting the dog.

MAN

Do you want to give him a biscuit?

The girl nods.

MAN (CONT'D)

They're in my car.	Why don't you --

DISTRAUGHT WOMAN'S VOICE

Excuse me?	Hello?

INT. LACUNA RECEPTION AREA - DAY

Mary, with a headset on, looks up, startled. She switches off the tape. She has been crying. There's a pile of tapes next to her. The distraught woman is standing there.

MARY
May I help you?

DISTRAUGHT WOMAN

I'm here for Dr. Mierzwiak.	My name is
Helene Kernfeld.

MARY

Yes, please have a seat. The doctor will be with you momentarily.

The woman sits.	Mary presses an intercom button.

MARY (CONT'D)

Howard, your 10:30.

She switches the tape back on.

SAD WOMAN'S VOICE

He took me to his car and ...

Vague shot of the girl being raped.

INT. COMMUTER TUBE - DAY

The old woman is staring off blankly, her giant manuscript in her lap, as she travels over the New York skyline. We move into her eyes.

INT. VAGUE SPACE

Vague reenactments of memories intermingle in this undefined
 
space:

The young girl being raped by the man in the car.

A soldier on a battlefield looking at his slaughtered friends.

A couple fighting, from the woman's point of view.

MAN
I...I... I... find you physically
repulsive!	I can't even look at you!

They look at each other in silence.

A little boy being called "faggot" by an endless succession of boys.

The aftermath of a car accident from the driver's POV.

Mary having an abortion.

INT. COMMUTER TUBE - DAY

The old woman and her chair lift out of the line of commuters.

INT. WAITING ROOM - DAY

It's modern and well-appointed. The old woman enters, sits behind the reception desk, drops her manuscript into the drawer. She takes some pills with water. An old man enters.

OLD MAN
How are you today, Mary?

OLD WOMAN (MARY)
Let's see... Still dying, Howard.

OLD MAN (HOWARD)

You don't have to jump down my throat. I was trying to be nice.

OLD WOMAN (MARY)
Well, don't try.	It's unbecoming on you.

Old Howard mutters something and disappears into the back. Old Mary pulls out a file from behind, removes a small disc, places it in a machine on her desk, slips on earphones and listens, somewhat wearily but attentively. We watch the color drain from her face, but don't hear the recording. Another old woman enters the office. Old Mary looks up, seems a bit startled, conceals it, turns off the tape.

OLD WOMAN (MARY) (CONT'D)
May I help you?
 

SECOND OLD WOMAN

I'd like to make an appointment.

OLD WOMAN (MARY)

I think the doctor is free this morning. He can probably take you right away for an initial consultation.

The second old woman smiles gratefully.

INT. OLD MAN'S OFFICE - A FEW MINUTES LATER

Old Howard works at his desk. Old Mary enters with the second old woman.

OLD WOMAN (MARY)

Dr. Mierzwiak, this is Clementine
Kruczynski.	She'd like to talk to you.

Old Howard and the old Mary eye each other.

OLD MAN (HOWARD)
Hello, Ms. Kruczynski.	Nice to meet you.

Please have a seat.

He indicates a sitting area.	She sits.	He joins her.

OLD MAN (HOWARD) (CONT'D)

Would you mind if I tape our discussion?

She shakes her hear. He punches a couple of buttons on his computer console. A tape recorder starts up and his computer screen lights up so only he can see it. On it we see a whole file on Clementine Kruczynski: a list of fifteen dates of previous erasures stretching back fifty years, all of them involving Joel Barish.

OLD MAN (HOWARD) (CONT'D)

So, why don't you begin by telling me why you've come here.

SECOND OLD WOMAN (CLEMENTINE)

Well, I met this man, Joel, three years ago at a senior dance... We'd both been alone for so long and...

INT. TUBE - NIGHT

The old woman (Mary) travels in the commuter tube over Manhattan. It's late, the tube is mostly empty. She has earphones on.

SECOND OLD WOMAN (CLEMENTINE) (V.O.)

I remember Joel and I were having
breakfast --
 
INT. VAGUE SPACE

An old man and the second old woman eat breakfast.

SECOND OLD WOMAN (CLEMENTINE) (V.O.)

--	I said something like we should go upstate and see the leaves change...

The old man looks up from his cereal and stares blankly. The woman smiles, but there is no response... just a dead stare.

SECOND OLD WOMAN (CLEMENTINE) (V.O.)

(CONT'D)
He just stared at me as if I didn't

exist.	As if I had never existed...

INT. TUBE - CONTINUOUS

The second old woman's (Clementine) voice drones tinnily on in the distance. The old woman with the earphones is dead, her eyes glassy and unseeing.

SECOND OLD WOMAN (CLEMENTINE) (V.O.)

--	his eyes used to be so filled with love. But it was gone. How can I go back to being alone after seeing love? I was alone for so long. What had I done with my life? I was alone so long.

INT. SECOND OLD WOMAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

The old Clementine is unconscious on her bed, hooked up to modern versions of the erasing machines. Two young technicians monitor the equipment. The woman's bedside phone rings. Her machine picks up. After a moment:

OLD MAN'S VOICE

Hi, it's Joel. What's going on, Clem? Why won't you call me back? Please call me. We need to speak.

The machine clicks off. One of the technicians reaches over and presses the "erase" button on the machine.

BLACK.

THE END
