INT. BILL & ALICE'S APT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
It is a week before Christmas.  The tree is decorated and
Christmas cards stand open everywhere in the comfortable Central Park West apartment.
Settled into the couch in the living room, watching TV, are seven year-old , HELENA, and the BABY-SITTER, a young college girl. BEDROOM
BILL and ALICE HARFORD, an attractive couple in their thirties, are in evening clothes preparing to leave for a party.
ALICE
(looking in mirror) How do I look?
BILL You look great.
ALICE My hair okay?
BILL Perfect.
ALICE You're not even looking at it.
Bill kisses her neck.
BILL
It's absolutely beautiful.  You always look beautiful.
ALICE Oh, shut up...  OK, let's go.
They walk into the living room.  The baby sitter gets to her feet.
BABY-SITTER Oh, you look so-ooo lovely, Mrs.
Harford.
ALICE
(laughs) Thank you, Roz.
(to Helena) All ready for bed?
HELENA
Yes, Mommy.  I took my bath and brushed my teeth.
AD-LIBS of praise as BILL and ALICE kiss HELENA goodnight.
BABY-SITTER
What time do you want Helena to go to bed?
HELENA
Please, Mommy, can I stay up late tonight and watch the
(name of TV show) Ple-eease.
ALICE When is it on?
HELENA Ten-thirty.
ALICE Okay, darling, but just for tonight.
HELENA Thank you, Mommy.
The house intercom rings.  BILL goes to answer it.
DOORMAN (VOICE) Doctor Harford?
BILL Yes.
DOORMAN The car is here.
BILL OK, we'll be right down.
Bill returns to sitting room.
BILL OK the car's here - let's go.
(to Baby-sitter)
Roz, we might be late tonight but I'll hold the car to take you home.
BABY-SITTER Oh, that's great, Doctor Harford.
Thanks very much.
 
AD-LIBS of Good nights and have a good time. EXT. HIRED CAR DRIVE-BY (CPW TO 5TH) - NIGHT (2ND UNIT)
INT CAR - NIGHT BILL takes ALICE's hand and gives her a loving wink.
EXT. ZIEGLER MIDTOWN MANSION - NIGHT BILL'S car pulls up behind a stretch limo.
INT. CAR - NIGHT
The driver hands Bill a clip board with a form attached to it.
DRIVER Can you sign this, Doctor?
The doorman, carrying an umbrella, opens the car door.
BILL
(signing) Okay, thanks..
DRIVER Thanks.
(handing his card)
Just phone about half hour before you want to be picked up.
BILL OK.  Fine.
DRIVER Have a good evening.
BILL and ALICE exit the car and enter the house.
INT. ZIEGLER MANSION - NIGHT Big party already in progress.
Sound of a dance band off.
Many guests still arriving.
Two ladies seated at a table confirm that Doctor and Mrs Harford are on the invitation roster.
Their coats are taken.
The hosts, VICTOR ZIEGLER, a fit, sun-tanned, man in his midfifties, and his wife, ILLONA, a Hungarian beauty, stand to one side greeting their guests in the large entrance hall.
ZIEGLER
(speaking above the noise)
Bill!...Alice!...  I'm so glad you could come.  It's wonderful to see you both,
AD-LIBS of further greetings while they shake hands and kiss on both cheeks.
ZIEGLER
And Alice, my dear, forgive the pitiful understatement but you look totally beautiful.
Victor and Alice exchange if-there-was-world-enough-and-time smiles.
ZIEGLER
And Bill, that osteopath you sent me to?  He was wonderful.  You should see my serve now.
BILL Yes, he's the top man in the world.
ANOTHER FABULOUS ROOM - A LITTLE LATER
BILL and ALICE, carrying champagne glasses make their way through the glitterati.
They stop to admire the 17 foot Christmas tree trimmed with colored lights and antique ornaments. BALLROOM - BILL & ALICE DANCING
BILL's attention is caught by one of the musicians on the bandstand.
BILL I don't believe it.
ALICE What?
BILL
The guy at the piano.  That's Nick
Nightingale, I went to medical school with him.
ALICE He's plays pretty good for a doctor.
BILL He's not a doctor.  He dropped out. 
I'm going to have to say hello to him.
ALICE
Okay, I'll go and get us some more champagne.
BILL I'll see you at the bar.
BILL walks over to the bandstand as they finish a set.
BILL Nick!..  Nick Nightingale!
NICK Hey!  Bill Harford!  What a surprise.
How the hell are you?
AD LIBS of greetings as they shake hands.
BILL God, how long has it been?
NICK Ten years?
BILL And a couple.
NICK How's life been treating you?
BILL
Not too bad.  And you've become a pianist.
NICK My friends call me that.
BILL
(laughs)
And how do you happen to playing here tonight?
NICK
I know my Cole Porter and I work cheap.
They both laugh.
NICK
How about you.  Still in the doctor business?
BILL
You know how it is, once a doctor, always a doctor.
NICK
In my case, never a doctor, never a doctor.  You _don't_ know how that is.
BILL
I never did understand why you walked away.
NICK
No?  It's a nice feeling.  I do it a lot.
The BAND LEADER comes over and gives NICK a nod and BILL an polite smile.
NICK
Okay, we're off again.  Listen, if I don't catch you later, I'm down in the Village for the next two weeks, at the Cafe Sonata.  Come by if you get a chance.
BILL
(nods)
Cafe Sonata, right.  Okay, and listen, it was great seeing you again.
NICK Same here.  Take care.
The band starts up again.
The ballroom is crowded and BILL starts to make his way around the dance floor to the bar. ALICE is at the bar waiting for him.
She reaches absently for her champagne glass... and finds she is holding - or touching - a man's hand.
ALICE
(smiles) I think that's my glass.
SZABO I'm absolutely certain of it.
SZABO is a handsome man, in his mid-forties with a slight Central European accent.
He drinks slowly from ALICE'S glass and looks directly into her eyes as he does so.
SZABO
Did you ever read the Latin poet Ovid on The Art of Love?
ALICE
Didn't he wind up all by himself, crying his eyes out in some place with a very bad climate.
SZABO But he also had a good time first. 
A very good time.  By the way, my name is Sandor Szabo. I'm Hungarian.
ALICE
Pleased to meet you.  My name is Alice.  I'm American.
SZABO Would you like to dance, Alice?
ALICE notices BILL across the room talking to two beautiful models.
ALICE Why not? - Sandor.
ACROSS THE ROOM - BILL & THE MODELS GAYLE, the taller model, shouts to BILL above the music.
GAYLE Nobody likes you?
(louder) Nobody likes you, is that the problem?
BILL
Put it this way, nobody wants to admit how much they like me.  But I'm confident it can still happen.
GAYLE
(laughs) Do you know Nuala Windsor?
GAYLE asks, putting her arm around her friend's waist.
BILL
(smiles) Nuala...I certainly feel like I do. 
How do you spell, Nuala?
NUALA N..u..a..l..a.
BILL Is that a Hawaiian name?
NUALA No, it's an agency name.
They all laugh.
GAYLE You were very kind to her once.
BILL
Only once?  That sounds like an oversight.
NUALA
I was on a shoot, modelling at
Rockefeller Center, on a very windy day.  You happened to be passing by.
BILL
(remembering) And you got something in your eye?
NUALA
Just about half of 5th Avenue.  You were such a gentleman.
BILL
That can happen when you're in a hurry.
NUALA
You actually had a handkerchief which was also clean!
BILL
That's the kind of hero I can be sometimes!
ALICE is dancing with the Sandor.  He holds her close to him.
SZABO What do you do, Alice?
ALICE
Well, actually, I'm looking for a job at the moment.  I was an editor at a publishing house but they went broke.
SZABO
Perhaps I can be of some help.  I know a few people in publishing.
Alice doesn't reply to this.
SZABO And you're married?
ALICE shows him her wedding ring.
SZABO
And you're here tonight with your husband?
ALICE I am, indeed..
SZABO How sad.
Alice makes a that's-life face.
SZABO
But of course I should have guessed that.  If you weren't with your husband tonight you wouldn't be so careful.
ALICE laughs.
SZABO
May I ask why a beautiful woman who could have any man in this room wants to be married?
ALICE You can ask.
SZABO
You know why women used to get married, don't you?
ALICE Why don't you tell me.
SZABO
It was the only way they could lose their virginity's and be free to do what they wanted with other men. The ones they really wanted.
ALICE Fascinating.
SZABO
Victor and Illona have a fabulous art collection.
ALICE They do, don't they.
SZABO
Have you ever seen the Impressionist stuff upstairs?
ALICE I don't think so.
SZABO
There are a couple of magnificent Bonnards up there.
ALICE Are there?
SZABO Do you like Bonnard?
ALICE Yes, I do.
SZABO
Would you like me to show them to you?
ALICE Well, maybe not just right now.
SZABO We won't be gone long.
ALICE smiles and shakes her head.
BILL AND THE MODELS NUALA slowly leading BILL to the door.
NUALA
Do you know what's so nice about doctors?
BILL Usually a lot less than people think.
NUALA They look so...  knowledgable!
BILL
They are very knowledgeable - about all sorts of things.
GAYLE
But I'll bet they work too hard.  I bet they miss out on a lot of fun.
BILL
You're absolutely right.  Where we going, girls?
NUALA (laughs)
Where the rainbow ends.  BILL slows down a little.
GAYLE
Don't you want to go where the rainbow ends?
BILL
Do I want to go where the rainbow ends?
Before he can answer, a big man who looks like he stepped right out of The Godfather walks up - HARRIS, Ziegler's personal assistant.
HARRIS
Excuse me, Doctor Harford.  May I trouble you for a moment?
BILL Sure.
HARRIS
(nods towards the door)
Could you spare a minute, please?
BILL What's up?
HARRIS Could you come with me, please?
GAYLE It's something for Me. Z.
BILL Okay.
GAYLE Come back soon.
The girls blow kisses.  Bill smiles.
ALICE AND SZABO DANCING
SZABO Alice, you're a fascinating woman.
ALICE makes a can't-help-that face.
SZABO I'd really like to see you again.
ALICE
I don't think that would really be a good idea.
SZABO
You are cruel.  What about lunch, later this week?
BILL AND HARRIS - CORRIDORS AND STAIRCASE Muffled sounds of the music echo from the ballroom below.
HARRIS stops in front of a large door and knocks quietly.
ZIEGLER (O.S.) Yes?
HARRIS It's Harris, sir.
After a few seconds the key is turned in the lock and the door slowly opens revealing a barefoot ZIEGLER wearing only his pants and undershirt.
ZIEGLER Thanks very much for coming up, Bill.
He gestures BILL in.  HARRIS waits outside.
A strikingly beautiful, half-naked woman in her late twenties, is sprawled face up, her clothing scattered on the floor.
BILL What happened?
ZIEGLER She OD'd on coke.
ZIEGLER gestures to the cocaine paraphernalia on the night table.
BILL
(checking her pulse) How long has she been like this?
ZIEGLER Maybe ten minutes?
BILL feels her carotid artery.
BILL Has this happened before?
ZIEGLER Not sure, but probably.
BILL turns her face to the light of a table lamp to check her pupils.  The woman stirs.
BILL She's starting to come around.
The woman makes a few unintelligible sounds.
BILL takes her wrist again and looks at his watch.
BILL
Good...Well...I don't think there's really anything to worry about. Coke wears off in half an hour or so.
ZIEGLER is visibly relieved.
BILL continues to watch her in silence.
BILL
Someone should stay with her, though, until she's fully herself again.
ZIEGLER Okay.
BILL
Some cold towels on her face wouldn't be a bad idea.
ZIEGLER Okay.
BILL
Anyone here with her to take her home?
ZIEGLER
I'll take care of that... She's a friend of the family.
Bill nods and watches her for a few moments longer.  Then he makes moves like he wants to go..
BILL
She'll be all right, Victor.  Okay if I leave the rest to you?
ZIEGLER
Sure...  And listen, Bill, I don't know how to thank you enough for this.
BILL It was nothing.  Glad to be of help.
ZIEGLER
And, Bill - I know I don't have to say this but I trust this is just between the two of us.
BILL Of course.
BALLROOM
BILL re-enters the ballroom and looks around for the two models but he doesn't see them. Then... a woman's arm slips through his.
He looks down at the wedding-ringed hand.
It's ALICE.
She is flushed and glad to have found him.
ALICE Haven't I seen you someplace before?
BILL Could be.  What's your name again?
She kisses him.
ALICE Can we go home now?
BILL AND ALICE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
ALICE stands naked in front of her dressing table mirror rubbing face cream.  BILL comes up behind her, kisses her shoulder and runs his hands lightly over her breasts.
V.O. That night they were more blissful in their ardent love than they had been for a long time.
SHOTS TO ILLUSTRATE V.O.
Getting up.
Alice and Helena in the kitchen.
Bill in his office with patients.
V.O. The gray of morning awakened them only too soon.  Alice had to take Helena to school.  And Bill had a number of early appointments.  So the evening hours passed in the predetermined daily routine of work, and the events of the night before began to fade.
BILL'S APARTMENT - HELENA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
HELENA reading aloud to BILL and ALICE from "A Child's Garden of Verses".  She finishes her poem and yawns.
BILL And now, my darling, time for bed.
What do you say?
HELENA smiles and puts her arms around BILL.
BILL and ALICE kiss her goodnight, turn out the lights and go into the living room. LIVING ROOM ALICE sighs comfortably.
 
So, how do you feel about wrapping some presents?
BILL
Kind of negative.  We can do it tomorrow.
Bill drops down on the couch, picks up the TV controller and starts switching channels. Alice snuggles up to him.
ALICE Anything good on tonight?
BILL Have you got the paper?
Alice puts her arms around him.
ALICE I don't feel like watching TV.
They kiss.
ALICE
Let's break the law a little first
BATHROOM - A FEW MOMENTS LATER
Bill takes a Band-Aid box from the bathroom medicine cabinet and removes a small plastic bag of pot. BEDROOM Alice skillfully rolls two joints.
MINUTES LATER
Bill and Alice sitting in bed, partly undressed and smoking the joints. Alice inhales and leans back with an ashtray in her lap.
She is high.
ALICE How about the truth game?
BILL Always a bit dangerous with pot.
Isn't that the fun?
BILL I'm putty in your hands.
ALICE
Okay, let's start with who were those those two gorgeous women at the party last night?
BILL
Don't really know.  One of them just started talking to me.
ALICE I thought they might be patients?
BILL
No such luck.  They're models.  One of them said I once removed something from her eyes on windy day in Rockefeller Plaza.
ALICE Always on the job.
BILL That's me.
ALICE
And what did they want from you this time?
BILL My body - what else?
ALICE doesn't find the remark particularly amusing.
BILL
Hey, come on - all I did was talk to them...  Anyway, who was the guy you were dancing with?
BILL is not that interested and just wants to change the subject.
ALICE Sandor?
BILL Sandor...  Who is he?
A friend of the Zieglers.
BILL And what does he do?
ALICE I never actually found out?
BILL Rich?
ALICE Talked like he was.
BILL And what did he want?
ALICE Sex.  Upstairs.  Then and there.
The pot makes ALICE think this is hilarious.
BILL Well, I guess that's understandable.
ALICE Understandable?
BILL Well, you're a beautiful woman.
ALICE
Oh, I see.  So does exhaustive research show that every man I meet wants to screw me?
BILL There might be some exceptions.
ALICE
Does that mean that all men, with possibly some exceptions, want to screw all beautiful women, married or otherwise?
BILL I suppose, basically, yes.
ALICE
So does that mean you wanted to screw the two models?
 
BILL I did say with some exceptions.
ALICE And of course you're an exception?
BILL Yes.
ALICE How come?
BILL Because I love you.
ALICE Any other reasons?
BILL Because we're married.
ALICE Any others?
BILL
And because I wouldn't lie to you or hurt you.
ALICE
So basically what it comes down to is that you wouldn't screw the two models out of consideration_for me, but otherwise you would.
BILL Hey, is this thing on Court TV?
BILL feigns looking around for cameras.
ALICE
Why don't you just give me a straight answer?
BILL
Hey, come on, honey.  The pot's making you aggressive.
He takes her cigarette and puts it out.
ALICE
I'm not being aggressive at all and how about you not putting out my -BILL Okay.  Okay.  Okay.
ALICE
Now try to be honest.  When some really great-looking woman comes in to your office to have her tits checked out, don't you ever think about screwing her?
BILL
Come on, give me a break.  I'm a doctor.  It's all very impersonal. And anyway my insurance requires that a nurse is always present.
ALICE
You're being evasive.  When you're feeling her tits, is it never any more than sheer professionalism?
BILL Basically, that's all it is.
ALICE Just basically?
BILL
Oh, come on.  There are no absolutes in anything.
ALICE
No absolutes...  Okay.  Fine...  And does the same thing go for women? While they're having their tits squeezed, do you suppose your lady patients ever wonder what your dick might be like?
BILL Definitely not.
ALICE And why is that?
BILL
Because they're too worried about what I might find.
ALICE You know what I mean.
BILL No, again.  Not most of them.
ALICE Why?
BILL
Well, I suppose that most women are programmed differently from men.
ALICE
Oh, yes, I forgot.  Millions of years of evolution - right?  Men have to put their sperm into as many women as they can, but women stay at home with pretty pink things and take care of the children?
BILL
A bit oversimplified but something like that.
A dispirited smile passes over her face.
ALICE Oh, if you men only knew.
The look in her eyes changes, becoming cool and impenetrable, and BILL allows her hands to slip from his.
BILL
If we knew -?  What do you mean by that?
ALICE
(in a strangely harsh voice)
About what you imagine, my dear.
BILL
Hey, Alice, hey, look at me...  The truth.  Is there something you've kept from me?
ALICE looks down with a strange smile.
BILL You're just trying to wind me up.
ALICE If you say so.
BILL
If I say so?  Wait a minute.  I'm not going to let you get away with that...  Seriously...  Is there's something you haven't told me?
ALICE stops short of saying something.
BILL Say it.
ALICE nods.
ALICE
Well, last summer at Cape Cod - I don't suppose you remember one night in the dining room, there was a young Naval officer sitting near us.  He was with two other officers.
BILL
As a matter of fact, I don't  But what about him?
ALICE
The waiter brought him a message during dinner, at which point he left the table?
Bill waits for her to continue.
ALICE
Well... I first saw him that morning in the lobby.  He was checking in and he was following the bellboy with his luggage to the elevator. He glanced at me as he walked past but didn't stop until he had gone a few more steps.  Then he turned and looked at me.  He didn't say anything. He didn't smile.  In fact, it seemed to me that he scowled.  Maybe I did the same thing.
ALICE stops for a moment.
ALICE
I was very stirred by him.  That whole day I lay on the beach, lost in dreams.
She stops.
BILL Go on.
ALICE thinks about how to continue.
BILL stares at her.
ALICE
That afternoon you and I made love and talked about our future, and our child.  Later we were sitting on the balcony and he passed below us without looking up.  Just the sight of him stirred me deeply and I thought if he wanted me, I could not have resisted.  I thought I was ready to give up you, the child, my whole future.  And yet at the same time if you can understand it - you were dearer to me than ever, and I stroked your forehead and kissed your hair, and at that moment my love for you was both tender and sad.  At dinner I wore a white rose and you said I was very beautiful.  It might not have been just an accident that he and his friends sat near us.  He didn't look up but I actually considered getting up, walking over to him and like someone in a movie, saying, 'Here I am, my love, for whom I have waited - take me.'  Well, it was about then that the waiter brought him the envelope.  He read it, turned pale, said goodbye to his friends - and glancing at me mysteriously, he left the room. 
ALICE stops for a moment.
ALICE
I barely slept that night and woke up the next morning very agitated. I didn't know whether I was afraid that he had left or that he might still be there...  But by dinner I realized he was gone and I breathed a sigh of relief.
Long silence.
BILL And if he hadn't left?
Alice doesn't reply.
ALICE I don't know.
BILL doesn't say anything but there is a scornful expression around his mouth.
The phone rings.
BILL Hello?...Oh...  When did they call?...
No, I have the address...If they call again say I'm on my way.
He hangs up the phone and starts to put on his shoes.
BILL Lou Nathanson just died.
ALICE
Oh, that's too bade.  But you were expecting that, weren't you?
BILL Yes...
Bill starts to get dressed.
BILL I have to go over there for a while.
ALICE Now?
BILL I have to show my face.
BILL silently getting dressed.
ALICE
Obviously, it was a mistake to have told you.
BILL
(coldly)
Not at all..  We must always tell each other everything.
ALICE It was the pot.
BILL
It doesn't really matter.  Nothing happened.  Just a passing fancy.
EXT. MARION'S APARTMENT HOUSE - NIGHT
BILL's taxi pulls up to the stylish, lower 5th avenue apartment. Doorman opens the door.
INT. MARION'S LOBBY
Bill walks to the elevator
INT. MARION'S PRIVATE ELEVATOR - LOBBY Bill exits elevator and find's her door ajar.
He knocks softly and enters without waiting for a reply.
BILL
(softly) Marion?
He walks through the quiet apartment.
MASTER BEDROOM
The body of LOU NATHANSON lies on a large bed with an oxygen cylinder and other medical paraphernalia on tables on each side of the bed.
MARION, the dead man's daughter, a pretty girl in her late twenties, sits at the foot of the bed, exhausted, her arms hanging limply at her side.
She starts to get up but BILL stops her with a movement from his hand, and she merely greets him with a nod, her eyes large and sad.
BILL moves to the head of the bed and mechanically places his hands on the forehead of the dead man and on his arms.
He shakes his head a couple of times and his shoulders drop with a slight expression of regret.
BILL I hope his last moments were peaceful.
Marion gives him a despairing look.
He puts his hands in his pockets and his eyes wander about the room until they finally rest again on Marion.
BILL
Well, Marion, at least you weren't entirely unprepared for this.
She holds out her hand to him.  He takes it sympathetically.
Marion sighs, woefully.
MARION Dad seemed pretty good today.
 
Around nine o'clock he said he felt like taking a nap.  So I went into the living room to watch television. I don't think I was out of his room for more than half-an-hour.
Marion starts to weep.
MARION
When I went back, at first I though he was still asleep...  Then I realized he wasn't breathing...  I did everything you had told me but... he was....
She can't bring herself to say, dead, and she shakes her head, despairingly.
MARION
I called the emergency people... But when they got here they just said he was...dead and asked whether I wanted them to take him away.
She breaks down sobbing.
BILL draws up a chair and sits down opposite her.
BILL
Marion, from what you've said, it sounds like your father died in his sleep.  He wouldn't have suffered.
MARION
Oh, God...I hope not... I've been so afraid of the actual... dying business...  But he made it so easy, just as he tried to make everything else in my life easy.
BILL takes her hands.
BILL
Have you notified any of your relatives?
MARION I phoned Carl - my fiancee.
She does not look BILL straight in the eye when she says, fiancee.
He's going to make some calls for me and then he's coming over.
BILL Oh, that's good.
MARION
I think you've met Carl here a few times?  We're planning to get married in April.
BILL
Oh, that's wonderful.  I'm very happy for you.
They sit for a few moments without speaking.
V.O. I certainly do remember Carl.  So she's going to marry him, Bill thought to himself.  I wonder why?  She surely can't be in love with him.  He's nothing to look at, and he hasn't got any money...  He's just an assistant in professor of something or other...  But then it's none of my business.  Still... if she were my mistress, her hair would be less dry and her lips would be fuller and redder.
Marion suddenly starts to talk.
MARION
Dad had so many worries and disappointments.  My mother was never well...  And my brother...he was such a disappointment...  I don't even know where he is.  The last we heard from him was from some small town in Mexico.  I can't even remember where.
In spite of himself, BILL places his hand on her head, caressing it.  He feels her body begin to tremble and her sobs become louder and finally quite unrestrained.  All at once, she slips down from her chair and kneels in front of him, clasping his legs with her arms and pressing her face into them.
She looks up at him with large eyes, wild with grief, and whispers ardently:
I don't want to leave here...  Even if you never return...  Even if I am never to see you again...  I want, at least, to live near you.
BILL looks touched rather than surprised.
BILL Please - get up, Marion.
He says this softly, and bending down he gently raises her up.
He glances at the dead man on the bed and only puts his arms around her in a very hesitant embrace and kisses her on the forehead.
At the same time, without knowing why, a sense of anger wells up against ALICE.
Jealous fantasy image of Alice and the Naval officer.  The door bell rings.
He hastily kisses Marion's cheek, as if in gratitude, and goes to the door.
It's CARL standing there - a very ordinary looking man with an umbrella in his hand and a serious face appropriate to the situation.
The two men greet each other much more cordially than is called for by their actual state of acquaintance.
They walk to the bedroom and CARL has an embarrassed look at the deceased.
CARL
Oh, my poor, dear Marion.  I am so sorry.
He puts his arms around her.
BILL goes into the next room to write out the death certificate.
When he finishes, he returns to the bedroom where the engaged couple sit, hand in hand, by the bed of the dead man. The door-bell rings.
CARL I'll get it.
 
While he is out of the room, Marion, with her eyes on the floor, says, almost inaudibly:
MARION I love you.
BILL merely pronounces her name tenderly.
BILL Marion.
CARL returns with Marion's UNCLE and AUNT and aunt, whose presence gives BILL the opportunity to make his goodbyes and leave. At the door.
CARL I hope we'll see you soon.
EXT. MARION'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Bill walks outside.  It has become even milder.  A gentle breeze carries from the nearby park to the street.  BILL inhales the fresh air.
DOORMAN Taxi?
BILL
No thanks.  I think I'll walk for a bit.
EXT. STREET TO PARK - NIGHT Bill walking.
EXT. PARK - NIGHT
Walking through the park, BILL notices on some of the benches in the shadows, that couples are kissing, just as if Spring had actually arrived and no danger lurked in the deceptive warm air.
A tramp lies full length on a bench wrapped in newspapers with his hat over his face.
V.O. The image of the tramp made him think of the dead man he had just left, and he shuddered and felt slightly nauseated at the thought that decay and decomposition had already begun their work in the body he just left.
V.O. He was glad he was still alive and in all probability that these ugly things were still far removed from him, and that he was, in fact, still in the prime of life, had a beautiful wife and could have several women in addition, if he wanted to, although doing so would require more free time than he had.
BILL notices a group of rowdy college boys coming towards him, six of them taking up the whole walkway. He moves aside to keep out of their way.
But as they pass, one of them, a tall boy with an open overcoat, deliberately bumps into him with his raised elbow. BILL involuntarily stops.
The tall student takes two more steps and turns.
They glare at each other for a moment with only a short distance separating them. Suddenly, BILL turns around again and walks.
He hears a short laugh behind him.
He wants to turn around and fight but he feels his heart beating strangely.
V.O. Had he become a coward, he asked himself, and noticed his knees were shaking a little bit.  Ridiculous! Why should he get involved in a street fight with some drunken college student who had five friends with him.
BILL keeps walking without looking back.
V.O. He, a man of thirty-five, a practicing physician, a married man and father of a child.  He might wind up in the hospital or worse and tomorrow be in the same position as the man he just left...  Then he thought about his profession?
V.O. There were dangers lurking there, too, everywhere and at all times except that one usually forgets about them.
EXT. STREET - ON WAY DOMINO - NIGHT BILL walking.
V.O. Surely, it had been nothing but common sense to avoid a ridiculous fight with the student...  but if he ever meet the Naval officer with whom Alice...
JEALOUS FANTASY IMAGE - ALICE AND NAVAL OFFICER V.O.
V.O. But what insanity!  After all, nothing happened...  What was he thinking about?...  But then, wasn't it really just as bad as if she had actually fucked him - she might just as well have.  Wasn't it even worse, in a way.  What a joy it would be to teach him a lesson.
EXT. STREET - DOMINO'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Bill passes a young girl, DOMINO, who falls into step beside him.
DOMINO Hi.
BILL slows down and looks at her.  She is very pretty with dark red lips.
BILL Hi.
DOMINO How're you doing?
BILL Fine.  How are you doing?
DOMINO
I'm doing great...Listen, how would you like to have a little fun?
BILL I'm sorry?
DOMINO
Have a little fun.  Come inside with me?  I just live over there.
She points to a nearby doorway.
BILL a little off balance.
BILL Come inside with you?
DOMINO
Yes.  It's a lot nicer than it is out here.
BILL Do you live there?
DOMINO Yes.
BILL By yourself?
DOMINO I have a roommate but she's not home.
She gently takes his arm.
DOMINO It's okay - no one will bother us.
BILL smiles, uncertainly.
DOMINO Really, it's okay.  Come on.
BILL allows himself to be led to the door.
DOMINO
(gently) Come on.
INT. DOMINO APARTMENT LOBBY - NIGHT
She leads BILL through the small, dingy entrance lobby lit by a flickering fluorescent tube to a ground-floor rear apartment.
BILL Should we talk about the money?
DOMINO
How does sixty sound?  BILL nods, a little uncomfortably.
BILL Sixty.  Sounds good.
DOMINO laughs.
DOMINO
(laughs) I don't keep track of the time.
She unlocks the door and they go inside.
It's a clean, reasonably tidy, ex cold-water railway flat.
The girl smiles sweetly, and walks ahead of BILL into the narrow bedroom where there is a neatly made king-size bed without a bedspread...
BILL By the way, what's your name?
DOMINO Domino.
BILL Domino.  That's an unusual name.
DOMINO
Well, it's my, uh...professional name.
BILL Right.
DOMINO And what's your name?
Bill hesitates.
BILL Bill.
DOMINO Hi, Bill.
BILL Hi, Domino.
DOMINO Would you like a drink or some grass?
BILL No thanks.  I'm fine.
She puts on some music.
BILL Nice little place.
DOMINO Yes, it's okay.
BILL Is this really your place?
DOMINO That's the second time you asked.
BILL
No, it just that I was under the impression that most girls didn't use their own apartment - too much hassle.
DOMINO
That's true but I don't do this that much.
BILL Oh, how's that?
DOMINO
I only work when I get too far behind with my student loan.
BILL is a little surprised.
BILL What school are you going to?
DOMINO NYU.
BILL NYU.  What are you studying?
DOMINO Sociology.
BILL Good sociology department?
DOMINO
Pretty good.  Ever hear of Pearlstein and Johnson?
BILL
To be honest, I'm not much into sociology.
She slowly starts to undress.
DOMINO What do you do?
BILL I'm a doctor?
DOMINO A doctor?
BILL Yes.
DOMINO GP?
BILL Yes.
DOMINO My father's a GP.
BILL
No kidding?  I hope I don't know him.
DOMINO He practices in New Jersey.
BILL New Jersey...
She steps out of her panties and tosses them on the table.
BILL
Listen, I know it's a little late for this but do you mind if I ask how old you are?
She stands naked before him with her arms outstretched.
DOMINO How old do you think?
BILL
Well, to be honest, I would have said sixteen or seventeen but obviously if you're going to college...  eighteen?
DOMINO Nineteen.
She puts her arms around his neck again and gazes into his eyes.
DOMINO Well, shall we?
Bleep-bleep. 
BILL's cellular phone.
Bleep-bleep.  He fumbles in his pockets for the phone and DOMINO has to get off his lap for him to get it out.
BILL Hello?
It's ALICE.
BILL Hi, honey.  Yes, everything's okay... 
I'm not sure...  We're waiting for some relatives to show up...  It could be late...  No, don't wait up. Can't really talk...  Okay, as soon as I can...  Same here.
He disconnects and puts the phone back in his pocket.
DOMINO Was that Mrs. Doctor Bill?
BILL thinks for a moment and nods.  Then he sighs and gets to his feet.
DOMINO
(not a question) You have to go.
BILL I'm afraid so.
DOMINO What a shame.
He gets out his wallet and starts to count out sixty dollars.
DOMINO Oh, look, you don't have to...
BILL No, that's all right.
DOMINO Really.  It's okay.
BILL
No, no.  Listen, we need more good sociologists.
They both laugh.
DOMINO Okay but you've got a raincheck.
BILL That's a deal.
EXT. STREET TO CAFE SONATA - NIGHT BILL walks aimlessly through the wintry night.
V.O. Where shall I go now, he asked himself?  The obvious thing was home to bed.  But he couldn't persuade himself to do that.  He thought of going back to the girl but that somehow seemed ridiculous now.  He was overcome with a sense that he was moving farther and farther away from his everyday existence into a completely different world.
