FADE INTO:

SEPIA-TONE FOOTAGE

of a pig chasing a lion chasing a dinosaur chasing an elephant. Noah's Ark going round... and round... and round...


EXT. GRIFFITH PARK CAROUSEL - DAY

Disjointed CALLIOPE MUSIC as the wheel of fate and fortune goes around until we PULL BACK to reveal:

JON ARCHER (30) rising winged Pegasus. On the adjacent unicorn is his son MATTHEW (5). Clutching a balloon, Matty waves at his dad. A happy moment, like so many certain to follow -- until we realize we are watching them THROUGH...


SNIPER'S RIFLE SCOPE - SNIPER'S EYES

wait until the child clears his aim -- Archer is the target. They round the bend and disappear...


MATTHEW

Loses his grip on the unicorn. Archer reaches over and pulls him into his lap. They happily ride together...

As the horses sweep back INTO VIEW... exposing Archer...

Now we see the sniper. CASTOR TROY is cool, efficient, aggressive, sexual. His finger closes around the
 
trigger.

BOOM! A BULLET RIPS into Archer's back. Bleeding... he drops off his horse... and sinks to the deck of the carousel. His eyes desperately searching... searching... searching... until he sees --

Matthew lies on his back -- still. Slowly, Archer reaches out and takes Matthew's hand... and now we see COLOR for the first time...

Blood red... as bleeding father touches bleeding son...

TILT UP TO the winged Pegasus flying by -- now in full color and UP UP UP TO Matthew's red balloon... floating away.

HANDEL'S MESSIAH OVER a SERIES OF SHOTS:


FBI BRIEFING ROOM

Gazing out the window as dawn breaks over the city below is Jon Archer... older... unshaven... fatigued... his eyes reveal a man in the grip of obsession.


CAROUSEL HORSE

sweeps by, as if marking time itself...


HOLY PLACE

Smoky, spiritual... dominated by a gleaming, golden cross. A priest kneels before it -- deep in prayer. The glimmering cross comes INTO FOCUS... but it's just a light-reflection... off the casing of a large bomb. This is no chapel... but an atrium. Somewhere.

And as the "priest" rubs out his cigarette we see it's Castor Troy -- carefully installing this complex device.


ANOTHER CAROUSEL HORSE

sweeps by...


ARCHER

pockets his FBI badge, then holsters his gun...
 


CASTOR

sets the bomb timer -- then replaces a wall panel in front of it. Totally hidden.


BRIEFING ROOM - CASTOR'S MUGSHOT

is on a computer screen. His criminal dossier scrolls by endlessly: bombings, assassinations, mercenary kidnappings, terrorism-for-hire...

Rookie agent LOOMIS studies the details carefully. Other agents -- including BUZZ and WANDA scan computer grid-maps, man phones, etc. amid the take-out cartons and coffee cups. These people are on high alert.

ARCHER

Any follow-up from L.A.P.D.
Intelligence?

BUZZ

No, sir, nothing yet.

ARCHER

Get them on the phone -- now.
What about S.I.S. and our airport
teams?

WANDA

We've had everything from psychics
to satellites on this.	Even if
Castor was here... he must have
slipped the net by now...

ARCHER

He's here!	And we're going to
keep looking until we find him!

A silence descends on the chastised team. As they go back to work, veteran agent TITO BIONDI takes Archer aside.

TITO

Jon, these people have been
working round the clock -- you
gotta cut them some slack...

Archer considers his best friend's advice -- then...
 
ARCHER

I'll cut them some slack when I
cut myself some slack.

Archer marches out -- slamming the door behind him.


INT. CORRIDOR - DAY (MORNING)

Castor quietly shuts the security door behind him. An Hispanic voice startles him.

JANITOR

What are you doing?

CASTOR
(in perfect Spanish)
Thank goodness, I feel like Icarus
in the labyrinth -- where's the
men's room?

JANITOR

(in Spanish)
This area is off limits, Padre.
(re:	security door)
How did you get in that room?

Realizing the JANITOR is already too suspicious, Castor puts a priestly arm around him -- and leads him down the hall.

CASTOR

Okay... I have a confession to
make, but you aren't gonna like
it.	I was planting a bomb.

JANITOR

Bomb?

CASTOR

You know -- boom --
(patting his

neck)
Oh, never mind...

The Janitor suddenly twitches, his eyes rolls up in his head. As he gasps his last -- Castor heaves him down a stairwell. Now we see the needle-thin custom stiletto in Castor's hand.

Castor kicks the Janitor's mop and bucket down the stairs -- making everything look like an accident.
 


INT. SAME BUILDING - MAIN FLOOR - DAY (MORNING)

The children's church choir -- 200 strong -- sing "Behold the Lamb of God." Clergy and lay persons listen reverently.

"Father" Castor strolls by the singers -- casually heading for the exit. As he passes the risers, a teenage girl drops her sheet music at his feet.

Returning it -- he whispers in her ear -- so close he's practically licking it.

CASTOR
I've never enjoyed 'The Messiah.'
But your voice makes even a hack
like Handel seem like a genius.

He pats her behind and leaves. Although a little shaken, she's also drawn by Castor's sexual magnetism.


EXT. LA CONVENTION CENTER - DAY (MORNING)

The marquee proclaims:	INTERNATIONAL CHURCH CHOIRS 18th-
21st:	AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION.

Castor exits -- politely holding the door for a beat cop.


INT. ARCHER'S OFFICE - DAY (MORNING)

The office is a monument to obsession: photographs, clues, newsclips, totems of Castor Troy surround a pacing Archer.

ARCHER

(on phone)
... I don't have time to get a
warrant from some hung-over judge.

Just give me the go-ahead, Victor,
and I promise -- as soon as this
is over -- you can brand my butt
with the Fourth Amendment.

The instant Archer hangs up -- the INTERCOM BUZZES.

KIM (V.O.)

Sir, your wife's on line one...
S.I.S. on two...
 

ARCHER

Tell her to hang on --

As Archer punches up line two -- Tito bursts in.

TITO

A jet was chartered at Anderson
Airfield.	Guess who just showed
up to pay for it?	Pollux Troy.

ARCHER

Scramble the Reaction Team --
we're moving out.	And get one of
our people on that plane.

TITO

But there's still no sign of
Castor...

ARCHER

Where one brother goes, the
other's sure to follow...

They rush our... the hold button on line 1 still blinking.


EXT. PRIVATE AIRPORT - ESTABLISHING - DAY

A sleek Cadillac pulls in... stopping next to a Land Rover.

LARS MUELLER -- a muscular, crystal-eyed jar-head -- gets out of the Caddy. An instant later -- LUNT MUELLER -- emerges from the Rover. They are identical twins.

The men scan the airport carefully, then open the rear doors of their respective vehicles. Castor emerges from the Caddy -- Armani clad.

Exiting the Rover is Castor's younger brother POLLUX TROY -- skittish, brilliant, paranoid -- a human hummingbird.

POLLUX

You're 26 minutes late.	The
casing didn't fit -- right?	I
knew that cheap-shit Dietrich
would rip us off...

CASTOR

Oh, God -- !
 

POLLUX

What!?

CASTOR

I forgot to turn the damn thing
on!

POLLUX

You're kidding, right?
(to the twins)
He's kidding...
(grabs Castor
by throat)
... are you fucking kidding!?

Castor hugs Pollux lovingly.	Pollux squirms like a kid.

CASTOR

Bro -- everything went fine.

POLLUX

I hate when you call me bro.

Pollux heads for the jet. Castor hands Lunt a wad of cash.

CASTOR

Thanks for babysitting.

LUNT

Anything else?

CASTOR

I'll contact you when we get the
rest of the money.
(turns to leave)
Oh, and stat away from downtown.
The inversion layer's going to be
pretty thick around the 18th.

The twins nod... then take off. Castor heads for the jet.


INT. JET - DAY

Castor hustles in -- exhorting the PILOT.

CASTOR

Let's go, let's go!
 

As the JET TURBINES start to WHINE, Castor sinks into his seat. A very sexy FLIGHT ATTENDANT appears and hands him a Scotch. He downs it, looking her over salaciously.

FLIGHT ATTENDANT

Would you like anything else?

CASTOR

Hell, yes...
(pulls her into lap)
It's the only way to fly.

She smiles, not minding, until the jet suddenly slows its taxi down the runway.


COCKPIT

Castor yanks open the door.

CASTOR

What's wrong?


AT END OF RUNWAY

A squat car creeps INTO VIEW -- blocking the runway.


EXT./INT. HUMVEE - MOVING - DAY

Behind the wheel is Jon Archer.	Beside him is Tito.


BACK TO ARCHER

CASTOR

It's Archer.
(gun to Pilot's
head)
Go, dammit!

Suddenly the gun is BLASTED from Castor's hand. he turns around to see... the Flight Attendant behind them -- holding a smoking pistol. This is Agent WINTERS.

WINTERS

F.B.I.!	Throttle down, captain!

But Castor elbows the throttle up. The jet lurches forward, throwing Winters off balance. Pollux tackles her as the jet picks up speed.
 


INT. HUMVEE - DAY

Archer slams the vehicle into gear.

ARCHER

Get out.

TITO
You're not playing chicken with
two tons of aluminum...

ARCHER

Get out!

Tito obeys as Archer peels out. The HUMMER ROARS at the jet.

The jet picks up speed, trying to get aloft.

The humvee is aimed right at it... Archer's eyes narrow.


COLLISION COURSE

as two hunks of metal bear down. The machines are seconds apart when --

Archer looks up to see...

Winters' face pressed up against the cockpit window, Castor holding a gun to her head.

Archer cuts the wheel -- just avoiding the jet. The Hummer skids to a stop as Federal back-up arrives -- but too late. Archer watches an FBI chopper -- landing in a swirl of dust.

As the jet picks up speed... the hatch opens. Castor blasts Winters in the side and tosses her onto the tarmac.


INSIDE

Castor smiles at Pollux, sensing freedom, until...

KA-CHUNK:	Something POUNDS the jet -- from above.
Castor leans out the hatch and sees...

The chopper on top of them -- Archer at the controls.
 

Eye-contact -- years of hatred pass between these men.

Castor BLASTS at him from the open hatch.

The chopper's left windscreen spiderwebs. Archer jerks and weaves -- dodging the BULLETS. The chopper pulls away.

The jet finally lifts off... when...

The chopper settles on the jet -- slamming at its tail.


TARMAC

Tito reacts to this madness -- as the chopper plays a deadly game of leap-frog with the jet.

The end of the runway is coming up fast.

Archer crushes the jet's horizontal elevator flap.


JET PILOT

can't budge the jet's jammed yoke. Thwarted, he powers back the throttle. Thrust reverse.

CASTOR

What are you doing?

PILOT

The horizontal elevator's smashed!
We can't lift off!


CASTOR

SHOOTS the Pilot -- then takes the controls. He struggles to maneuver the jet. Suddenly...

A biplane descends right at them -- about to land.


ARCHER

pulls up just as the JET swerves radically to avoid the biplane and SLAMS into the hangar.


JET
 

plows through the GLASS DOOR, the NOSE-WHEEL SNAPS off. The PLANE SKIDS right into the hangar -- finally stopping at the wings.


FBI CHOPPER

lands. Archer steps out calmly -- like a cop about to write a traffic ticket. He hurries to join more FBI agents rushing into the hangar ahead of him.


INT. HANGAR - DAY

The jet hatch pops open -- Castor leaps from it, FIRING.

Two FBI agents drop -- riddled.

Pollux appears at the hatch -- an FBI sharpshooter FIRES, grazing Pollux's shoulder. Staggered, Pollux falls --

Castor catches him before he hits the floor -- simultaneously BLASTING the sharpshooter.

Castor drags Pollux back into the smoke-filled hangar.

Archer arrives and quickly checks the dead agents, his anger building. He signals Tito and the others to spread out.


DEEP IN HANGAR

A maze of airplane debris and heavy machinery. Led by Archer, the FBI agents pick their way through it.

ROOKIE LOOMIS snaps alert -- did he see something?
Advancing carefully, he comes up on...

Castor -- staunching Pollux's shoulder wound. Pollux sees the agent -- and FIRES.

Loomis hits the floor -- his bleeding ear is shredded.

Suddenly a forklift charges down on Castor and Pollux.

Tito is at the wheel. Castor FIRES -- forcing Tito to dive off. The forklift careens on -- driving apart the brothers.

The forklift upends a stack of heavy crates -- pinning
 
Pollux.	Castor tries to free his trapped brother.

POLLUX

Forget it -- Go!	Go!

He slaps his Glock into Pollux's hand.

CASTOR

Wherever they put you, I'll find a
way to get you out...

Pollux starts FIRING -- covering Castor as he runs through a tunnel which leads to an adjoining hangar.

Suddenly Wanda presses her machine-pistol into Pollux's head. As Pollux raises his gun -- Tito grabs his hand.

TITO

--	not unless you want that 200 I.Q. splattered all over the floor.

(as Archer approaches)

We got him now, Jon.

ARCHER

That's what you always say.	Seal
it off.	I'm going in.

Archer moves away from the group and enters the tunnel.

MUSIC as Archer and Castor begin their cat-and-mouse dance.

Sensing Archer, Castor pauses by an old landing gear. He draws a fresh pistol from his ankle holster and moves on.

Archer pauses at the landing gear... his own stealthy movements mirroring Castor's.

Castor waits behind a stack of steel drums... his gaze trying to penetrate the darkness... He SNAPS his fingers. The sound ECHOES as he tries to draw Archer in.

Archer reacts to the sound and SNAPS back -- answering the challenge. As the deadly beat between them continues --

BLAM BLAM BLAM! Archer spins away just as Castor OPENS FIRE from the gloom... one step ahead.

INTERCUT as necessary:
 

CASTOR

Jon, I'm getting a little annoyed
by your obsessive need to spoil my
fun.

ARCHER

And how much will your 'fun' net
you this time?

BOOM BOOM BOOM!	Half-blind SHOTS send Castor spinning.
A moment later, Archer pursues... SNAP!	He fits a new
CLIP into his pistol.

CASTOR

What's it to you?	I declare it.
Here I am, back in the States for
less than a week --

ARCHER

You're under arrest.	Incredibly,
you still have the right to remain
silent --

CASTOR

I've got something going down on
the eighteenth... it's gonna be
worse than anything God ever
dumped on the Pharaoh.	I'll give
it up -- but my brother and I have

to walk.

ARCHER

No discussion -- no deals.

CASTOR

What're you gonna do with me
locked up?	You'll drive your wife
and kid nuts!	I bet your daughter
is just about ripe by now.	What's
her name, Janie?

Enraged, Archer steps boldly forward -- trying to draw his enemy out. Silence -- then Archer senses...

Castor is behind him. He FIRES -- Archer dives away. The BARRAGE CONTINUES -- driving Archer back between two huge turbine engines. As Archer reloads, he stares at the control panel switches.

Castor moves in for the kill when he hears a final SNAP-SNAP. Except it isn't a finger snap... it's two
 
switches.

VRRRROOOM! The TWIN ENGINES ROAR on! Unable to fight the churning tornado-force wind... Castor's blasted across the hangar... slamming hard into the far wall.

The ENGINES STOP and Archer emerges -- joined by Tito.

TITO

Tell me he didn't get away
again...

Then Tito follows Archer's gaze to Castor's lifeless body. Still as death -- somehow his mocking smile survives.


EXT. AIRPORT TARMAC - SUNSET

Heavily-manacled, an extremely agitated Pollux is herded into a SWAT van by Buzz and Wanda.

POLLUX
Where's my brother?!	I want to
see my brother!

The van takes off -- passing an imposing older man, flanked by two bodyguards. Bullying through the media, Assistant FBI Director VICTOR LAZARRO scans the devastation.

Approaching Archer, he watches as Castor's body is loaded on the ambulance. A sheet covers Castor's lifeless face.

LAZARRO
The oversight committee would've
roasted us for this one -- thank
God it paid off.	Damn fine work.

ARCHER

Real fine, Victor.	Especially the
casualties.

Archer contemplates the slain agents -- their three bodies laid out in a row -- waiting to be zip-locked. Lazarro reacts grimly as a reporter snaps a photo of the bodies.

Instinctively, the two men close ranks. Archer grabs the Nikon, ejects the film, then shoves the camera back.

LAZARRO
 
Classified information.	No

photographs.

Lazarro puts a caring arm around Archer's shoulder and leads him away from the media... and the carnage.

LAZARRO

You okay, Jon?
(off Archer's nod)
Then go home.	Tell Eve.


EXT.	ARCHER'S HOME (SANTA MONICA) - SUNSET

A renovated Craftsman. Sipping a carton of milk, Archer pulls into the driveway. He sits, gathering his thoughts.


INT. ARCHER'S HOME - NIGHT

Archer enters and sees his wife EVE. Handsome, intelligent.

ARCHER

Hi...
(no response)
... What's wrong?
 

She nods toward the KITCHEN.
and hard fifteen-year-old.
on the table.
 


JAMIE is there -- a sullen There are cigarette cartons

 

EVE

She complimented for her 'F' in
history with an 'A' in
shoplifting...

Archer marches into the kitchen -- noting the crate of Marlboros. Jamie matter-of-factly pours herself coffee.

ARCHER

Nice stunt, Jamie.	You break the
law and I'm expected to ignore it?

JAMIE

That's right -- it's all about
you.	Don't even ask me what
happened.

Archer looks to Eve for help. Eve shakes her head -- nope.
 

ARCHER

Okay.	What happened?

JAMIE

Like you'd ever fucking believe
me!

She bolts. In anticipation, Eve calmly opens the door as Jamie rushes out, then closes it behind her.

EVE

Well, you tried.	You failed
miserably, but you tried.

ARCHER
Why won't she even talk to me?

EVE

Maybe because you taught her never
to speak to strangers.
(immediately
regrets it)
I'm sorry... that wasn't fair.

Eve kisses his cheek -- then gathers up her doctor gear.

EVE

I've got patients waiting.	Try
again, Jon.	She hates you -- but
she needs you.

ARCHER

Eve...

Something in Archer's expression makes her stop.

EVE

Jon -- what is it?

But he's too overcome.	He starts to speak -- but can't.

EVE

Is it -- him?	It's... it's over?

Emotions avalanche across his face until he finally looks up. Eve pulls him close -- a sheltering embrace for them both.

ARCHER

I'm going to make everything up to
you and Jamie.	I'll put in for a
 
desk job.	We'll go away, get

counseling -- anything you want.
This time, I mean it.


INT. ARCHER HOME - NIGHT

Freshly dressed, Archer heads down the hall. He pauses at the door to Jamie's room when he sees -- Jamie.

Fully clothed, she's fast asleep on her bed cluttered with clothes and assorted girl-stuff. Her face peaceful.

Archer looks around her room... sees the stuffed animals collecting dust... replaced by makeup, jewelry, beefcake Calvin Klein ads and band posters, etc.

Archer's startled to see a lacey bustier... his little girl is growing up fast. And he's missing it.

He pulls the blanket up over her and quietly slips out.
The instant he leaves, Jamie kicks the blankets off.


INT. FBI BUILDING - DAY

Dominated by the FBI seal. Archer steps to the check point.

SECURITY GUARD

Print, please.

Archer presses his thumb to a scan-pad -- and is cleared.


INT.	BULL PEN - DAY

Efficient as a beehive -- agents, cryptologists, support staff buzz at their routines. Archer strides through -- drawing congratulatory nods and "thumbs up" signs...


OUTSIDE HIS OFFICE

Archer's team is there. Applauding. Proud. Uneasy with plaudits, he disperses the disappointed agents.

ARCHER
Much appreciated.	Now let's get
back to work, okay?

WANDA
 
(to Buzz)

Is that stick ever gonna fall out
of his ass?

Archer's well-built secretary -- KIM BREWSTER -- hands him his messages. She's holding a bottle of Dom Perignon.

KIMBERLY

The C.I.A. sent this over.	What
should I do with it?

ARCHER

Send it back and tell them to stop
wasting the taxpayers' money.

Anything else, Miss Brewster?

KIMBERLY

No, sir.

He enters his office.	Kimberly sighs and turns to Wanda.

KIMBERLY
Four years -- and he still calls
me 'Miss Brewster.'


INT. ARCHER'S OFFICE - DAY

Sitting at his computer -- Archer scrolls through Castor's file. He grimly contemplates face-after-face of Troy's victims -- finally pausing on a photo of his son Matthew.

Burying his feeling, he types "CASE CLOSED" over Castor's image. Archer starts to press "enter" when Tito comes in.

ARCHER

How's Loomis?

TITO

He needs some surgery, but he's
going to be okay.	That's the good
news...

ARCHER

Go on.

TITO

... Brodie and Miller from Special
Ops need to see you.
 

ARCHER

I don't have time for those cloak
and dagger guys.

Big NED BRODIE and athletic female HOLLIS MILLER stroll in.

BRODIE

You better make time, Jon.
(hefts a disc)
We found this in the jet wreckage
-- among Pollux Troy's effects...

Archer accedes as Miller pops in the disk. The computer screen displays a CAD schematic of the bomb. Archer studies it carefully -- unease growing.

ARCHER

Porcelain casing... Thermal
cloak... Undetectable payload.

MILLER
Powerful enough to flatten ten
city blocks.

ARCHER

'Worse than anything God ever
dumped on the Pharaohs.'
(to Tito)

Get Pollux Troy.	Now.

DISSOLVE TO:


INTERROGATION FOOTAGE

Wired to a complex machine -- Pollux seems to have his frustrated interrogators on the run.


INT. ARCHER'S OFFICE - DAY

Archer, Lazarro, Tito, Brodie, Miller and other FBI officials watch the monitor. Pollux remains implacable

POLLUX (V.O.)

(on screen)
That bomb was just a crossword
puzzle to me... a mental exercise.
I never built it...
 
Lazarro shuts down the monitor... turns to Archer.

ARCHER

He's lying.

LAZARRO

He's hooked up to a full-spectrum
polygraph.

ARCHER
Pollux is a manipulative
psychopath.	He can control his
heartbeat, his sweat glands, his
blood pressure...

LAZARRO
Jon, I trust your instincts, I
always have.	But D.C. wants more
evidence.	And frankly, so do I.

ARCHER

You'll get all the evidence you
need when ten thousand people die.

LAZARRO

We'll get a team right on it.	But
we can't evacuate the city on what
amounts to a hunch.

Archer looks at the gathered brass. He knows it's hopeless.

ARCHER

That bomb has been built, it's out
there somewhere and it's going to
detonate...


EXT. FBI BUILDING - INTELLIGENCE MEMORIAL - DAY

Words etched in the granite wall read:

IN HONOR OF THOSE MEMBERS
OF THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION
WHO SACRIFICED THEIR LIVES
IN THE LINE OF DUTY

Archer watches as a workman engraves the last of the three new stars among so many others -- each one honoring the dead.

BRODIE
 
Didn't Castor give any clue where

the bomb might be?

ARCHER
Only one person knows -- his
brother Pollux.	And he'll keep
his mouth shut until it blows.

BRODIE

We could plant an agent in his
cell -- get him to spill the
location.

ARCHER

Pollux is way too paranoid.	The

only person he'd talk to about
that bomb is Castor himself.	And
dead men can't talk.

Brodie and Miller exchange a knowing look.

BRODIE

There might be a way around
that...


FULL SCREEN - CASTOR'S BODY

Tubes and hoses are plugged into every orifice.


INT. ICU ROOM - DAY

Archer stares at the body... he can't believe it.

ARCHER

Why are you keeping him alive?
(gets no answer)
As long as he's breathing, he's
dangerous.

MILLER

Relax, he's a turnip.

Miller grinds out her cigarette on Castor's leg. Of course, Castor just lies there like a vegetable.

BRODIE
We can arrange for you to enter
Erewhon Prison -- as Castor Troy.

ARCHER
 
What are you talking about?

Archer turns as DR. MALCOLM HOAG (50s) enters the room.

HOAG

I think I'd better answer that
question.
(offers hand)
Malcolm Hoag.	I run the
Physiological Camouflage Unit for
Special Ops.

ARCHER

I know who you are.

MILLER
But you don't know what he can do.
Physical augmentation; enhancement
surgery...

BRODIE

... He can disguise a compromised
agent or alter the likeness --
even the voice -- of a government
witness.

HOAG

Let me show you how it's done.
(leading him out)
I think you'll recognize our

patient...


INT. HOAG'S SURGICAL BAY - DAY

Loomis lies still as a surgeon carefully scrapes away charred flesh around his burned ear. The doctor turns to a --


STEREO-LITHOGRAPHIC MACHINE

Laser-beams attack an organic soup with incredible precision. The light forces a chemical reaction -- and out of the soup -- an ear begins to form. It rises from the liquid, now fully-formed. The surgeon takes the ear and fits it in place on Loomis's head. He starts suturing.


OBSERVATION BOOTH - ABOVE
 

Archer, Hoag, Brodie and Miller watch the operation -- video-enhanced by the two huge screens on the far walls.

HOAG
With our new generation of anti-
inflammatories, healing is
accelerated from weeks to days.
By his next paycheck, he won't
even remember which ear he lost.
(a beat)
Your situation, however, would be
a little less permanent...

BRODIE

-- and a lot more classified.

Hoag holds up a face-sized organic shell made up of yellow cartilage pieces and tendons, etc. Archer pulls it over his face -- like a gauze mask. A "tendon" falls off.

ARCHER

This'll fool Pollux.

HOAG

That is a state-of-the-art morpho-
genetic template.	The inside can
be built to match the exact shape
of your skull; the outside --
exactly like Castor's.	Then we

fit his face right on top --

MILLER

-- and you become him.

ARCHER

You're talking about removing the
guy's face?

BRODIE

Borrowing, Jon.	The procedure's
completely reversible.

MILLER

One way or the other -- the
mission ends on the eighteenth.

Archer turns the shell over and over and over in his hands.

BRODIE

You know Castor better than
 
anyone.	You've lived and breathed

him for years -- hell, you even
look a little like him.

Archer shoves the template back at Hoag.

ARCHER

Find yourself another lab-rat.

MILLER
If you don't do this -- Castor
will beat us again.	He'll beat
you again...

Archer pushes his way past them -- and marches out.

HOAG

I don't think that went very well.

BRODIE

Trust us, Doc...

MILLER
... he'll jerk around.	Then he'll
be back.


INT. INTERROGATION BOOTHS - DAY

Archer enters... sizes up DIETRICH HASSLER. His stylish garb doesn't completely hide his criminal roots. Archer sits down calmly. He looks at his watch.

ARCHER

I'm in a hurry, Dietrich.	So
you've only got ten seconds to go
through your usual litany of lies,
empty threats, and moronic
denials.	Then I'm coming over
there --

DIETRICH

If you're in such a fucking hurry

--	why are you wasting your time with me? I'm just an art dealer.

ARCHER

You're a dealer, all right:
technical secrets, munitions...
explosives.

DIETRICH
 
You've never proven any of that.

And when my bitchy, never-been-
laid femi-nazi lawyer gets here,
she's going to...

ARCHER

Time's up.

Archer topples the wooden table and tears a leg from the top. Brandishing it -- he stalks the startled thug.


HALLWAY JUST OUTSIDE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Lazarro blanches as an obsessed Archer repeatedly slams the table leg against the wall -- above Dietrich's head.

LAZARRO

The only ticking bomb I see is
inside his head.	He's getting
worse, Tito.

TITO
Don't worry, sir.	It's all an
act...

But as Lazarro leaves -- we see Tito's worried, too.


BACK INSIDE BOOTH

Archer has a terrified Dietrich backed into the corner.

DIETRICH

... Okay!	Castor called me but I
blew him off... I swear I never
saw him.	And I don't know
anything about any bomb!


INT. CORRIDOR - OUTSIDE INTERROGATION BOOTHS - SAME TIME

Archer emerges... eyes blazing.

ARCHER

Let him go, but I want him
watched... Who's next?

TITO

Just Dietrich's sister...

In another booth, a careworn but striking woman sits with
 

a little boy on her lap. She gently helps him Crayola a book. This is SASHA HASSLER (30) and her son ADAM (5).


INT. INTERROGATION BOOTH - DAY

Archer hovers over Sasha -- her maternal warmth replaced by an icy hatred. Tito and the child are gone.

ARCHER
When was the last time you saw
Castor Troy?

SASHA

Who cares?	He's dead.

ARCHER

Answer the question.

SASHA

Look, I'm clean.	I teach kids
now --

ARCHER

Sasha -- you are a felon, on
probation for harboring Castor
Troy.	So it's in your best
interest to cooperate.
(as she's silent)
Would you like your son put in a

foster home?

Sasha's eyes flash, her body coils -- but she keeps control.

SASHA

No, but I'm sure you'd love it --
you sick bastard.

ARCHER

(unmoved)
When was the last time you saw

Castor Troy?

She stares at him with equal amounts of pity and hatred.

SASHA

I haven't seen him for years.


INT. CORRIDOR - DAY
 

Archer watches as Adam leaves Dietrich and jumps into Sasha's arms. She hugs him protectively. Adam sees Archer watching them -- and smiles. Archer doesn't smile back.


FULL SCREEN - CASTOR'S REAL FACE

PULL BACK TO:


INT. I.C.U. - NIGHT

Archer slowly circles Castor's muscular, hairy, tattooed body. Although on life support -- his signature smirk remains.

ARCHER

What about Lazarro?

BRODIE

No way -- the red tape alone would
take a month.	This is a black-bag
operation -- completely off the
books.

MILLER

If you need him, Tito can help you
prepare.	But you know the drill:
You can't tell anyone -- not the

Director, not your wife... nobody.

Archer's face shows he doesn't like it -- then he nods.

ARCHER
I'm in.


EXT. ARCHER HOME - NIGHT

Archer slowly gets out of his car. Trudging toward the front door, he picks up a basketball and takes a shot. His form is terrible -- he misses by a mile.


INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

Archer passes Jamie's room. Loud MUSIC POUNDS from within. He pauses to knock, thinks again, then heads down the hall.
 
INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

Eve is in bed. Archer comes in quietly and sits beside her -- studying her peaceful, sleeping face. She stirs.

EVE

I was dreaming...

ARCHER

Something good?

EVE

I'm not sure... you were flying
this weird old stunt plane...
doing flips... walking on the

wings... I was watching from the
ground -- when you fell.	You had
a parachute, but you wouldn't open
it.

ARCHER

Did you catch me?

EVE

No.

ARCHER

How come?

EVE

I don't know...
(nuzzles him)
Maybe because you've never needed
my help.

ARCHER

Come on, you made that up, didn't
you?

EVE

... Maybe I did...
(teasing)

... maybe I didn't...

They kiss affectionately. Passion building, Eve runs her hands over his body -- until her fingers touch a round scar on his chest. Archer freezes -- mid-caress.

EVE

It's all right, Jon.

ARCHER
 
After all these years, I still

can't get it out of my head -- an
inch to the left, Matty would
still be alive.

EVE

And you wouldn't be.

No response.	The pain hidden in his silence chills Eve.

EVE

Things will get better now that
you're home.	Everything will be
better -- now that... that man is
finally out of our lives.

ARCHER

Eve...

He starts to say the words. He wants, needs to share the truth with her. But he can't. Instead --

ARCHER
... If I had to do something to
find some closure... I should do
it, shouldn't I?... No matter how
crazy?

EVE
Oh, God -- you're going on
assignment again...

ARCHER

One last time.	And while I'm
gone, I want you and Jamie to go
to your mother's.	It's
important...

EVE

You said you'd be here!	You
promised!	What could be more
important than that?

ARCHER

I can't tell you... except only I
can do it.

EVE
You want me to tell you it's okay
to leave?	Okay, go on!	Go!

Fury erupting, Eve pushes Archer out of the bed.
 


INT. ANOTHER BEDROOM - NIGHT

Archer enters a child's room -- neat and tidy, like a museum exhibit. A starfield of glow-letters twinkles faintly.

He lies down on the bed and toys with his wedding band -- staring up at the words the stars form... "MATTHEW."

DISSOLVE TO:


INT. CONVENTION CENTER - MACHINE ROOM - BLINKING LIGHTS - NIGHT

The blinking LED of the bomb timer continues to count down.


INT./EXT. '56 BUICK/MOUNTAIN ROAD - MOVING - DAY

Tito drives into the Hoag compound.

Archer's beside him, juggling Castor's dossier:
documents, photos, etc.

TITO
Jon, this is goddam insane.	You
can't do it.

Archer says nothing... it's too late for debate. Tito parks. The men get out and head for the lab.

TITO

You haven't got a chance in hell
of fooling Pollux.	Castor drinks,
smokes and walks around with a 24-
hour hard-on.	He's nothing like
you --

ARCHER

Don't worry... If Hoag can do half
what he claims, I'll get Pollux to
talk.

Archer reaches for the door -- Tito stops him.

TITO

It's not that simple, Jon...
Becoming another person --
 
especially him -- nobody can come

all the way back from that... not
even you.

Archer considers his friend's words... He toys with, then removes, his wedding bang.

ARCHER

Keep this for me.

As Tito takes the ring -- a caring, but concerned look passes between the two friends.



INT. SURGICAL BAY - DAY

Two huge video screens are dominated by the CG-images of Archer and Castor. As Hoag briefs the team, the CG-images glow to reflect the physical characteristic Hoag refers to.

HOAG
Let's walk through it, Jon.	Your
blood types are different, but we
can't do anything about that.
Otherwise, nature is cooperating
nicely.	The height difference is
negligible -- within 1/2 an inch.
Eye color -- almost a perfect

match.	Penis size, flaccid,
essentially the same --
Substantial.

From the observation booth above -- Miller (flanked by Tito and Brodie) raises his eyebrow.

On the video screens, the images morph to signify the physical augmentations.

HOAG
Hairline will be adjusted with
laser-shears... micro-plugs for
the body hair... the teeth will be
bonded to match Castor's...

Hoag eyes Castor's inert, tight body -- then turns to Archer -- prodding his love handles like a livestock inspector.

HOAG

How about an abdominoplasty?
 

ARCHER

Abdomino -- what?

HOAG

A tummy tuck.	On the house.

ARCHER

Do it.


TRANSFORMATION MONTAGE

(INTERCUT huge video screen enlargements of Archer and
Castor's body parts as necessary):

Globules of adipose tissue are siphoned off Archer's obliques. At the same time...

Hoag recreates the "Great Sphinx" tattoo on Archer's thigh. We PUSH IN ON his leg, then PULL BACK to reveal...

Archer and Tito. The CLOSE UP on his leg becomes a FULL SHOT as he walks across the rooftop -- like himself. Tito demonstrated the proper "Castor gait": dangerously casual, like a panther.

Hoag reproduces Castor's fingerprints... then layers them over Archer's fingers.

Archer practices Castor's icy, killer glare. Tito hands him a lit cigarette. Archer brings the cigarette to his lips -- then coughs harshly. But he keeps trying.

Castor smiles... then smirks and laughs. PULL BACK to reveal Archer studying surveillance footage of Castor on a monitor-screen -- mimicking him.

Archer fusses with his new hair, trying to cover the thin spots. Giving up, he zips up his sweatshirt -- getting the zipper caught in his new chest hair.


EXT. HOAG INSTITUTE - GROUNDS - DAY

Tito tosses a pistol. Archer catches it with his right hand. But to Archer's surprise, Tito frowns.

TITO

Nice catch.	But you used the
wrong hand.
 

He takes the pistol away -- and slaps it in Archer's left hand. Then Tito shoves him -- challengingly.

TITO

Shoot me.
(as Archer
doesn't move)
Shoot me!

Tito pulls the gun against his own forehead.

TITO

You want to be Castor Troy?	If
you hesitate for a breath, you're

finished!	Now -- shoot me!	Kill
me!

Archer holds the gun unsteadily.	Tito is disgusted.

TITO

You can't do it... because Castor
is tougher than you...

BOOM! The GUN goes off -- the slug tears past Tito's head. Shocked, he touches his left ear, making sure it's still there.

Then Tito looks at Archer -- and sees the determination.


EXT. HOAG'S FACILITY - NIGHT

Clear and calm.	God's night.	Someone's God anyway.


INT. I.C.U. ROOM - NIGHT

Hoag leads Archer to a full-length mirror.

HOAG
Let's see if I missed anything
before I get my hands really dirty.

Archer removes the robe.	He's amazed to see:

His own head on Castor's body: a flat stomach, hairy chest, tattoos, thinning hair, etc. Hoag touches Archer's scar.
