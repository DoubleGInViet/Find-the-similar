EXT. ST. MARY'S CEMETERY - DAY

It's beautiful here, striking and sad. Now on foot, Castor follows Eve up a bluff, through a phalanx of graves -- with no idea where she's leading him.

Finally she stops at a crucifix-topped headstone. Castor joins her and reads the etched marble stone:

Matthew Archer, Age 5
Beloved Son & Brother
We Cherish You Always

Stunned, Castor watches as Eve kneels beside the marker.

EVE

Happy birthday, Matty.

She places a few child's toys on the marker... a shark...

a little bulldozer... a spaceship. Overwhelmed with grief, she collapses into Castor.

EVE

He took our baby, Jon.	He took
 
our little boy.


FULL SCREEN - CASTOR'S FACE

He stares at the grave of the boy he killed -- the boy whose mother is weeping into his chest.

The ever-present smirk is long gone as Castor stiffly returns Eve's embrace -- maybe, just maybe, feeling the victim's pain.

CASTOR

Stop crying... stop crying...
stop ...


INT. FBI BULLPEN - DAY

Shaking off his funk, Castor arrives at the office.

WANDA

You picked a helluva day to leave
your beeper off!

CASTOR

What happened?

WANDA
Castor's dead!

CASTOR

He's -- what?

BUZZ
Somehow he escaped from Erewhon.
But a prison chopper mowed him
down just off Long Beach Harbor...

CASTOR

Where's the body?

WANDA

It hasn't been recovered yet.

CASTOR

'It hasn't been recovered yet!'
You people have no idea who you're
dealing with!
(beat)
I want everyone on this, reports
on the half hour, and all leads
 
get routed through my office.

Buzz, alert the L.A.P.D.

BUZZ
L.A.P.D.?	Even if he is alive,
Castor isn't stupid enough to come
back to the city.

CASTOR

He's alive -- and he's already
here.	Move!


EXT. PIER - NIGHT

Something bobs up in the surf. Archer is thrashed ashore by the breakers... he crawls gasping onto the sand. He takes a few breaths -- then staggers up onto the beach.


EXT. TITO'S STREET - NIGHT

Archer's heart sinks as he sees the yellow police cordon taped across Tito's front door. Some teenage cholos notice him -- so Archer keeps right on going.


INT. TITO'S DUPLEX - NIGHT

A rear window is forced open -- Archer pulls himself in.
In the dim light, he sees the bullet hole on the wall...
then the blood stains within the forensics chalk marks.

He buckles and has to sit down. Taking a deep breath, he picks up the phone and dials.

ARCHER

Dr. Archer please.	It's an
emergency.
(listens)
-- Her husband.

Archer waits. He pinches his throat -- trying to dislodge the vocal implant. His voice scrambles into garbled static.

ARCHER

Hello, Eve -- I know this sounds
crazy, but --
(reverting back)
Dammit.
 

INT. HOSPITAL - ER - NIGHT

EVE deftly stitches up a gash above little IRIS's (8)
eye.

EVE

How did this happen, sweetie?

IRIS'S DAD
She fell off her Big-Wheel.

Something about his too-quick response rankles Eve. She eyes the yuppy Dad with suspicion -- then notes some bruises on the child's arm. A NURSE enters.

NURSE

Dr. Archer -- your husband's on
three.

EVE

Get Child Services down here --
and don't let her father leave.
(goes to wall-phone)
Jon?	Hello?

INTERCUT Archer and Eve as necessary.

ARCHER
Eve, listen carefully.	The man
you think is your husband --
isn't.

EVE

Who is this?

ARCHER

Please, just listen!	Take Jamie
and go to your mother's in Santa
Fe.	Don't tell him where you're
going -- just go.

EVE

Whoever you are -- don't call
again...

CLICK. Archer sags in futility. A SIREN snaps him back to reality.

Archer goes to the window and carefully peers out.

A squad CAR ROARS INTO VIEW -- then continues on its way.
 

ARCHER

I need to speak to Director
Lazarro immediately... I have
information about Castor Troy.

Waiting... Archer rifles the room... finding car keys...
a baggy jacket... Then...

INTERCUT WITH:


INT. FBI OFFICE

CASTOR

This is Jon Archer.	Who's
calling?

Archer pauses... hearing his own voice speaking to him.

ARCHER

Well, if you're Jon Archer... I
guess this must be Castor Troy...

CASTOR

I've gotta hand it to you, Jon.
You're doing a damn respectable
job of being me.	But let's face
it, we both liked it better the
way it was.	So before the cops

blow your brains out -- why not
tell me where you are...

ARCHER

If you were really me, you'd
know -- no discussion, no deals.

Archer hangs up == leaving Castor stewing.


EXT. GARAGE - NIGHT

The automatic door lifts -- revealing Tito's old Buick. The big V-8 RUMBLES as Archer pulls out. He doesn't get far as... menacing CHOLOS block his way.

CHOLO # 1

Where are you going?

CHOLO #2

Ten bucks he's the guy who popped
Tito!
 

The Cholos surround the Buick. Archer's cornered like an animal as the angry teens pound on the windows.

Archer HITS the GAS -- scattering all except Cholo #1 who jumps on the hood. Archer SLAMS the BRAKES -- sending the guy flying. He lands hard, but is only shaken up.

As Archer roars off, Cholo #1 pulls out his cell phone.

CHOLO #1

9-1-1?	I want to report a stolen
car and don't put me on hold!


INT./EXT. BUICK - MOVING - NIGHT

Archer drives on -- listening to KFWB.

RADIO REPORTER (V.O.)

... the escapee is considered
extremely dangerous.	If you have
any information concerning the
whereabouts of Castor Troy...

He SHUTS it OFF as he sees in the distance:


HIS OWN HOME

FBI and LAPD vehicles are parked in front. No way he's getting near there.

In his rearview mirror Archer spots a cop car approaching. He quickly turns a corner as the cop slowly cruises by.

ARCHER

No, Jon... you have to think like
Castor.	Where would he go...?

Archer gets an idea. But as he drives on -- the cop car backs up -- and reappears INTO FRAME.


EXT. MELROSE DISTRICT - NIGHT

Dietrich locks up his chic art gallery. He gets in his Lexus and drives out of the parking lot.


INT./EXT. STREET - LEXUS - MOVING - NIGHT
 

Dietrich slows down to check out the forensics team swarming all over Tito's parked Buick. Dietrich quickly averts his face as he spots... "Jon Archer" inspecting Tito's Buick.

DIETRICH

Jon Archer... some poor schmuck's
in big trouble.

ARCHER

Yeah -- me.

With surprising speed, Dietrich yanks a pistol from someplace and jerks around --

Archer -- hunkered down in the back seat -- stares into the barrel of Dietrich's pistol.

DIETRICH

Jesus Christ, Castor.

ARCHER
Drive.	And punch up your
cellular -- I need you to make
some calls.

DIETRICH

You're gonna get me busted!

ARCHER

You're already busted, Dietrich.
It's just a matter of time before
they pick you up.

Dietrich snakes the car past the crime scene and speeds off.

DIETRICH

Man, when you came to me about
that bomb -- I knew I should have
blown you off... but that's my

fucking curse -- I just can't say
no to a friend.

ARCHER

You can't say no to money.

DIETRICH

That's my other curse.
 
EXT. DOWNTOWN - LOFT - NIGHT (LATER)

Cars pull up in front of a gentrified loft amid the low-rent streets.

Emerging from them are several thugs -- including Aldo, Fitch and their sexy girl friends, LIVIA and Cindee.


INT. DIETRICH'S LOFT - BATHROOM - NIGHT

Archer splashes water on his face -- then stops and listens as the DOORBELL RINGS. He screws up his courage.

ARCHER

You're Castor Troy... This is your
old crew -- you don't take shit
and you don't take no for an
answer...


INT. DIETRICH'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

The thugs admire the loft -- dominated by an enormous, in-progress mural and stunning glass-bricked floor.

ALDO

Helluva place, Dietrich.	So
what's the big surprise?

Archer emerges.	The men are stunned -- the women beam.

FITCH

Are you crazy?	You're going to
bring the Feds down on all of us!

ARCHER

Archer doesn't want you, he wants
me!	But I'm going to get him
first -- with your help.

ALDO

Archer's a damn celebrity now --
he's untouchable -- and you're
radioactive.

He turns to leave. Archer wheels him around and smashes him into the wall. Aldo goes for his gun, but Archer's too quick -- he strips him of it.

The four bodyguards draw their weapons -- and surround Archer.
 

ARCHER

You wanna face-off with Castor
Troy?	Come on, then!	Come on!
'Cause I've had a real bad day...

Four against one -- and everyone's sweating but Archer. One-by-one, the bodyguards back off. Archer points the gun at Aldo -- then smiles and hands it back.

ARCHER

You're all forgetting who the real
enemy is.
(to Aldo)
Six months ago, Jon Archer hauled

you in for questioning.	He
rattled you so bad -- you shit
your Armani suit right there in
the interrogation room.

Aldo blanches -- how did Castor know that?	Fitch laughs.

ARCHER
You laugh, Fitch -- the way Archer
laughed at your last arraignment,
when you got down on your knees
and tried to blow your way to
freedom.

Stunned, Fitch cringes as everybody cracks up.

DIETRICH

We all have a reason to hate Jon
Archer.	We all want to see him
dead --

ARCHER

And nobody's untouchable if we say
he's not.

The thugs exchange a glance... reading each other...
considering.

DIETRICH

It's all worked out.	Caz has
Archer's routine down cold.

ARCHER
We start with your basic
kidnapping.	Then -- a little
surgery.
 
FITCH

Surgery?

ARCHER
I'm going to rearrange his face in
a way you won't believe.

ALDO

You're an evil bitch, Caz.	But
you've got balls of titanium.
Count us in.

Archer sighs with relief -- pleased with his performance.

DIETRICH

Come on -- let's drink to it!


FULL SCREEN - BLUE CAPSULE

Dietrich cracks it open -- powder sifts into a big high-ball glass filled with mescal. he hands it to Archer.

DIETRICH

How about one of your famous
toasts, Caz?

They all look expectantly at Archer... he's at a loss.

ARCHER

To old jobs, new jobs and -- uh --
blow jobs?

Silence -- then they crack up. Reluctantly, Archer swallows the tumbler of mescal... he fights back the urge to puke.

LIVIA

Enough business, Caz.	Let's
dance.

ARCHER

Sorry... I don't...

She drags him onto the glass floor. Cindee puts on some MUSIC as Archer's head begins to spin. The girls start "dancing," grinding Archer between their taut bodies. He tries to avoid it, but Livia kisses him -- hot, moist.

LIVIA

Remember the Charger's game, Caz?
The owners box?	We did it four
 
times.

ARCHER

Sure I remember... Once a quarter,
right?

Archer's eyes fall on the series of abstract paintings.

The twisted renderings make his head spin worse... as he starts to hallucinate... surrounded by enemies -- he struggles to regain control of his battered psyche.

LIVIA

Caz?	Are you okay?

He pulls away and stumbles down the stairs -- toward the kitchen.

DIETRICH

When even Castor Troy can't handle
a tab of Quantrex...
(raises his glass)
That, dear friends, is the first
sorry whiff of old age.


INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

Archer has his mouth under the tap -- drinking greedily. Woozy, he takes a breath... and notices a reflection in the window above the sink. Archer turns to see -- Sasha.

ARCHER

--	Sasha Hassler. Age 35. Met Castor Troy in Austin, Texas, at Pearl Jam reunion...

(catches himself) Uh, how you doing, baby?

She responds by slapping him -- hard.

SASHA

What the hell are you doing here?
You're supposed to be dead...

He wobbles, then falls flat on his face.	Out cold.


INT. ARCHER'S HOME - BALCONY - NIGHT

Castor's chain-smoking, looking out over the city -- wondering where Archer might be hiding. But something
 
breaks his rumination.	He sees --


DOWN STREET

A BMW pulls up to the curb. The THUMPING MUSIC from within GOES QUIET, but no one emerges.


EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)

Curious, Castor approaches the car, keeping a safe distance. He can see Jamie inside, struggling with Karl.

JAMIE

No... Karl, please.

He "shushes" Jamie -- but doesn't stop pawing her.

JAMIE

My father -- he's got a gun --
he'll -- he'll --

KARL

(pulls open belt)
That wimp won't do shit.

SMASH! The passenger WINDOW EXPLODES inward. Castor drags Karl out by his hair. Jamie scrambles out and flees toward the house as...

CASTOR

Who are you to call Jon Archer a
wimp?

Castor heaves Karl into the WINDSHIELD -- SPIDER-WEBBING it. Somehow the kid finds his feet and stumbles behind the wheel. The Beemer lurches away.


INT. HOUSE - NIGHT

Castor enters to find Jamie, still shaken up.

CASTOR

What are you -- stupid?

JAMIE
That's just like you.	Some guy
tries to rape me -- and you side
with him.
 
CASTOR

Did it look like I was siding with
him?	Did it?
(she falls silent)
You want to play with scummy organ
grinders, you better be prepared.
Do you have protection?

JAMIE

You mean like... condoms?

CASTOR

I mean like... protection.

With a fluid motion, Castor expertly SNAPS open a well-oiled SWITCHBLADE and hands it to an astonished Jamie.

JAMIE

For me?

CASTOR

Next time -- slip it in low, then
twist it -- so the wound doesn't
close.

She hugs him tight -- taking Castor by surprise. But he responds momentarily. About to pat her rump -- something makes him stop.

CASTOR

Go on, get out of here.

Jamie kisses him and heads up stairs. After she's gone...

CASTOR

No wonder he spent all his time
chasing me.	Who can deal with
this family shit?

The PHONE RINGS.	He rushes to the den and picks it up.

CASTOR

Jon Archer.
(immediately alert)
Where is he?


EXT. LOFT - ACROSS STREET - NIGHT

Using night-vision goggles, Pollux watches Sasha close her drapes. Visible in the b.g. on the sofa -- is
 
Archer.

POLLUX

(into cell phone)

--	I thought he might visit some old friends of yours. And bro, if I didn't know better -- I'd swear this guy likes being you...


INT. SASHA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Archer wakens.	Sasha is tugging off his pants.

ARCHER

Uh -- can't we just talk?

SASHA

Talk?	The only talk I ever heard
from you was 'take it off,' 'sit
on it,' 'I'll pay you tomorrow.'

She pulls out some fresh clothes -- and dumps them on him.

SASHA

Take off the rest of those rags
and get dressed.	Then get out.

ARCHER

Not until I finish my business
with your brother.

SASHA

I told him to keep those creeps
away -- but you're just too big an
attraction.
(calming herself)
Look, if the F.B.I. finds out
you've been here -- I'll lose my
son.	So please, just go.

For the first time, Archer sees not a hardened felon -- but a frightened, protective mother. And he realizes the effect his own relentless obsession has had on her.

ARCHER

I know I've done some things that
made your life harder...

SASHA

How would you?	You walked out and
 
never looked back.

ADAM enters, heading for his toys -- his presence cooling Sasha's deep-seated anger. Archer finishes dressing.

ARCHER

I'm not the same person you
remember.	And for what it's
worth, I'm sorry...

Her harsh look softens imperceptively -- like that of a woman trying to hate someone she still loves.

ARCHER

Not a bad fit.

SASHA

They should.	They're yours.

ARCHER

Nice-looking kid, too

SASHA
Of course he is...

Sasha fidgets, struggling with a deep inner turmoil.
Then...

SASHA
Adam, come here... I want you to
meet your father.

Archer's face pales over in shock.


EXT. SASHA'S ROOM - NIGHT

Their silhouettes are visible against the shades.

PULL BACK...


EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

Castor, Buzz, Wanda and Loomis peer at the silhouettes.

CASTOR

(into cellular)
We've got him sighted.	Okay,
Pollux, pull out.

BUZZ
 
What makes you so sure this guy's

gonna set up his own brother?

CASTOR
I've never been more certain of
anything.	Get everyone in
position.	Remember -- shoot to
kill.

Before Buzz can object, Castor's eyes say "don't argue."

BUZZ

You heard the man -- let's saddle
up!


INT. SASHA'S ROOM - NIGHT

Playing with his toys, Adam does not see Archer's icy gaze.

ARCHER

How old is he?

SASHA

Five.	No one knows you're his
father.	I thought someone might
want to hurt him -- just to hurt
you...

ADAM

Bang!	Bang!	Bang!

Startled, they turn to see Adam pointing a toy gun at them. Upset, she takes it from his hands.

SASHA

You know Mommy doesn't like you
playing with these things...

She kicks the toy aside and lifts Adam -- offering him to Archer. Awkwardly, Archer takes the boy.

Archer's emotions avalanche as his grip tightens -- his big hands dwarfing the little boy's body.

SASHA

You're not holding him right...
Caz...

Archer isn't hearing Sasha. He's lost in his own memory... the sound of a CAROUSEL... a KID'S LAUGHTER...
 
a GUNSHOT...

Then Adam smiles -- perhaps the way Matthew once smiled. It pulls something up from inside Archer -- something strong. He regains control, dumping the child into Sasha's arms.

ARCHER

He's not my son.

SASHA

Yes, he is -- !

Then something alerts Archer -- maybe the fleeting shadows that blot out the window-light for the barest second.

ARCHER

Get down!

K-BOOM-BOOM-BOOM-BOOM! The WINDOW PANES SHATTER -- as TEARGAS GRENADES and GUNFIRE riddles the loft.


OUTSIDE

across the way, Castor directs the FIREPOWER.


INT. UPPER LEVEL

Chaos. A bodyguard is mowed down. Dietrich and the others scatter and hit the floor.


KITCHEN

Cindee and Fitch are caught in flagrante delicto on the floor as the kitchen is decimated by GUNFIRE...


SASHA'S BEDROOM

Coughing, Archer crawls through the roiling smoke toward the door. He's almost out when...

SASHA

Adam!

Her wail of fear freezes Archer. He looks back -- and sees Adam in the eye of the firestorm.
 

Archer's face betrays his conflict. A child -- but his worst enemy's child.

BULLETS SHRED the WALL around Adam.	Getting closer.

Archer moves -- he crawls toward Adam.

Just then -- a SWAT agent rappels in through one of the shattered windows, his weapon poised. Archer kicks him hard, pitching him back through the window.

Archer grabs Adam -- curling him into his body. Thinking fast, he soaks his discarded T-shirt into a toppled flower vase -- then places it over Adam's face. Protecting him.

He rushes to Sasha. Together, they barrel through the soft, paper wall and tear out an escape route.


INT. KITCHEN

FIRING out the window, Fitch is riddled from outside by an agent as he CRASHES through the WINDOW.

Cindee slashes the agent with a cleaver. He FIRES -- BLASTING Cindee into the refrigerator.


LOWER LEVEL

Archer hustles Sasha and Adam toward the staircase when --


FRONT DOOR

explodes open. SWAT agents swarm to get in -- FIRING and throwing FLASH-GRENADES.


ARCHER, SASHA AND ADAM

are caught out in the open, when --


UPPER LEVEL

Dietrich, et al, open FIRE down on the attacking agents.
Agents drop or are driven back out.
 
SKYLIGHT

BURSTS open and agents rappel down -- FIRING. Aldo's bodyguard falls, riddled, off the upper level.


LOWER LEVEL

as one agent lands, Archer knocks his gun to the floor. They grapple. As the agent reaches for it -- Adam appears and kicks the gun away. Just like Mommy.


SASHA

scoops up the kicked weapon -- and cold-cocks another rappelling agent. Then she FIRES, cutting a third rappelling agent's rope. he drops hard to the floor -- unconscious.

Still grappling, Archer rips off the agent's gas-mask...

ARCHER
Buzz...

Buzz's eyes reveal only hatred. He reaches for his knife. Archer hesitates, then heaves Buzz through the glass door. He pushes Adam upstairs as more agents pour in the front door.

ARCHER

Dietrich!	The painting!


UPPER LEVEL

Dietrich sees the canvas mural above the breached front door -- and understands. He opens FIRE, cutting loose the mural. It collapses, billowing -- and enshrouds the attacking agents -- and buying time.

DIETRICH

Let's go!

Archer and Sasha flee up the stairs.


UPPER LEVEL

Sasha sees Adam huddled in the middle of the glass floor -- the shadows of agents moving below.
 
SASHA

Adam!


LOWER LEVEL

An agent aims his shotgun at the glass floor -- at the "target" kneeling on top of it.


UPPER LEVEL

Archer dives and grabs the boy as the GLASS FLOOR EXPLODES up. He rolls through a shower of glass -- but comes up with Adam safely.

Agents and thugs FIRE blindly upward and downward through the floor -- desperate to hit their targets.

Agents open FIRE from the girders supporting the roof -- cutting down Fitch's last bodyguard.

DIETRICH
They're like cockroaches!

Dietrich and Livia toss SMOKE GRENADES into the loft -- covering their escape.


TOP LEVEL

Dietrich leads them to the very back of the loft. He pulls open a hidden door.

DIETRICH
If we make it, we'll meet up at my
Malibu place.	You remember it,
Caz?

ARCHER

Off Kanan Road -- I know it.

Archer hands Adam over to Sasha.	She hugs her little boy

--	then embraces Archer tightly. Hanging on -- near tears -- because she knows this may be the last time.

SASHA

Thank you, Caz... thank you...

ARCHER

Get the boy out of here...
 
Livia and the remaining bodyguard hustle Archer out --


INT. ROTUNDA - NIGHT

MAC-10 poised, Livia and the bodyguard rush Archer through the deserted rotunda -- BOOM! BOOM! His escorts drop.

Castor rushes down the staircase -- BLASTING at Archer. Unarmed, Archer instantly disappears behind one of the eight columns. The columns are separated by mirrored-panels.

Cat-and-mouse as Castor slips in and out between column and mirror. He spots Archer dead-ahead and BLASTS away!

CRASH!	The MIRROR SHATTERS into a thousand pieces.

ARCHER (O.S.)

That's about a thousand years bad
luck...

Castor whirls, spots Archer again and FIRES! Another MIRROR. Sensing Archer behind him -- Castor turns and FIRES again -- this time BLASTING away his OWN
REFLECTION.

Then Archer leaps through a shattered mirror frame -- and onto Castor. They battle for control of the pistol.

CASTOR

It's too late, Jon.	Your kid
loves me.	And your wife's an
animal.	Even I can't keep up with
her.

They're so close Castor's whispering right in Archer's ear.

CASTOR
Tonight I'm going to make her come
like Niagara Falls -- to celebrate
your death.

Castor licks Archer's ear salaciously. Enraged, Archer tears the pistol from his grip and turns it on Castor.

He's got Castor dead to rights -- suddenly BULLETS SHRED the world around him. Archer staggers away as --

Loomis enters -- FIRING his M-16 as Archer dives for a
 
doorway.	Loomis FIRES the M-16's grenade launcher.

BOOM! The GRENADE EXPLODES -- the doorway bursts into flames -- but Archer has made it through.

Loomis tries to help up Castor -- who pushes him off angrily. Castor can't follow through the flames.


EXT. ROOF - NIGHT

Archer slams out of the interior stairwell -- but BULLETS force him to take cover behind the cupola.

Pollux FIRES at him from the other side.

Archer RETURNS FIRE -- driving Pollux back.	Stand-off.

POLLUX

Remember me?	Your 'baby brother'?

Trying to get the drop, Pollux carefully crawls onto the top of the cupola.

POLLUX

You tricked me into telling you
things I never told anyone...

Archer hears movement above him as Pollux reaches the crown.

POLLUX

Now take it to your grave.

Archer FIRES his PISTOL -- into the glass cupola -- and SHATTERS the GLASS beneath Pollux's feet. The cupola disintegrates beneath his weight. He plunges down into --


ROTUNDA

Castor watches in horror as Pollux pancakes onto the floor at his feet.

CASTOR

Pollux...

Pollux is almost gone.	Castor looks up and sees --
 


ARCHER
 

Peering down into the rotunda.


CASTOR

OPENS FIRE --


ARCHER

Ducks the bullets as he disappears.

Castor desperately holds Pollux -- to no avail. Pollux slips away... and dies. He turns to Loomis...

CASTOR

Get a medic -- now!

LOOMIS

Forget him, sir.	It's only Pollux
Troy...

Castor snaps. Without hesitation, he jerks up his GUN and PUTS a BULLET right in the middle of Loomis's forehead.

Castor looks at the dead kid -- his rage barely abated as -- Buzz and Wanda arrive on the scene and see Loomis's body.

WANDA

What happened?

CASTOR
What the fuck do you think
happened?	Castor Troy just
shot him!
(beat)
What are you waiting for?	Go!

After Buzz and Wanda take off -- Castor gathers Pollux up in his arms -- totally devastated.


INT. F.B.I - DAY

Dazed, Castor approaches his office. Kim proudly holds a copy of Time magazine. His photo is on the cover.

KIM

Sir -- you're on the cover of
 
Time.	They're calling you 'An

Authentic American Hero.'

He just pushes by her and goes into his office.


INT. FBI - ARCHER'S OFFICE - DAY

Alone -- Castor picks up the framed photo of Eve and Jamie -- staring at it with unbridled hatred.

Fury rising, he crumples the frame -- and the photo -- in his clenching grip. He hurls it into other Archer family memorabilia -- shattering more photos and souvenirs.

Only then does Castor notice Lazarro standing in the doorway. For how long -- he can't be sure.

CASTOR

What is it?

Lazarro shuts the door behind him.

LAZARRO

We were friends once, Jon, so I
feel I owe it to you -- to tell
you face-to-face...
(a beat)
I don't care how much hype you're
getting -- you're through.	After

that massacre last night, I'm
ordering a full inquiry into your
recent erratic -- and deeply
suspect -- behavior.

CASTOR

Me -- 'erratic'?	Victor, what are
you talking about?

Castor casually closes the blinds between the offices.

LAZARRO

You start meeting with Brodie and
Miller.	Then they die
mysteriously.	Your best friend is
murdered -- and you don't seem to
give a shit.
Suddenly you're smoking, drinking,
acting like a man with something
to hide...
(beat)
Maybe you've been bought -- maybe
 
you've lost your mind.	But I

promise... I'm going to find out.

Eye to eye... Castor knows he can't finesse this one.

CASTOR

Okay, Vic, I have a confession to
make.	But you aren't gonna like
it...
(wraps arm
around neck)
I'm Castor Troy.

LAZARRO

-- I don't understand...

Castor suddenly jabs his fist into Lazarro's chest. He pleads for mercy as Castor pounds and pounds away at his heart -- until it finally seizes up.

Lazarro twitches in a death throe, then slumps to the ground.

CASTOR

Now you understand.

He punches up the intercom button.

CASTOR
Cancel my four o'clock.
(beat)
And send for the paramedics.
Victor Lazarro's having a heart
attack.

Castor fixes himself a shot of mescal. He checks his watch -- as if counting -- then kneels beside Lazarro's body.

The door flies open -- and two medics rush in. They see Castor vigorously pumping Lazarro's chest -- "applying"
CPR.

The medics gently nudge Castor aside. One medic takes Lazarro's pulse, then shakes his head.


EXT. GRIFFITH PARK OBSERVATORY - DAY

Castor peers down over the city... trying to collect himself. He lights up a smoke... planning his next move. His meditation is broken as a police chopper circles
 
above.

MATCH CUT TO:


EXT. CITY - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY

LAPD choppers circle... squad cars prowl... cops and FBI agents set up roadblocks. The city is being sealed off.


EXT. DOWNTOWN - BROADWAY - DAY

Skirting a roadblock, Archer appears to be coming undone... wobbly, wild-eyed... he suddenly picks up a trash can and carries it down the street in front of his face.

Pedestrians gawk at this madman.	What's he doing?

Archer finally stops in front of a sporting goods store. He swings the trash can. SMASH! The store's WINDOW SHATTERS. An ALARM BLARES.

Passersby stare at Archer for a moment -- stunned. Then several youths leap into the window and start pulling merchandise out of the store.

Mayhem as others join in... clerks rush out to do battle.

An LAPD squad car hauls up onto the curb. A cop leaps out and chases as the looters scatter.

The driver stands at his door, radio in hand. Sensing something, he turns... just as Archer grabs the canister of Comply-Gas from the cop's belt.

Archer sprays him in the face.	The cop gags and sags.
Archer quickly slips behind the wheel.

Inside: Archer hits a switch -- the car's tinted windows darken automatically, obscuring him from the outside. He HITS the GAS -- SCREAMING away.


EXT. STREET - DAY

Archer slows the squad car.

Up ahead: Parked cop cars block both lanes of the main road -- a roadblock checkpoint for all traffic.
 

Archer pulls off the road, out of sight. He flips open the portacomp and starts to type rapidly.


INT. FBI - DAY

A DISPATCHER'S SCANNER CLICKS to life.

DISPATCHER

All units.	I have a confirmed
code zero-zero priority alert.
Proceed at once to Parthenia
Street Terminal.	That's Parthenia
at Nordhoff.


QUICK SHOTS

A)	MOTOR POOL

Tac squads pile into armored Jeeps.

B)	HELIPORT

Choppers lift off and veer east.

C)	ARCHER'S HOUSE

The surveillance CARS ROAR away.


EXT. ROADBLOCK - DAY

Archer watches as the checkpoint of cop cars pulls apart and screams east on the main road -- passing Archer. Once the armada is gone, he pulls out and heads west.


EXT. ARCHER HOME - BACK YARD - DAY

A plank in the fence swings aside as Archer slips into the yard. He peers out from behind the garage.

A cop sits in a lawn chair, tuning a POLICE-BAND RADIO.

Archer approaches the bird feeder. Quietly, he sticks his hand inside -- and searches for the key.

Just when he grabs it -- CAW-CAW -- an annoying BLUEBIRD hovers over Archer. The cop looks over -- but Archer is gone. All Lars sees is the bird.
 

INT. FBI - BULLPEN - DAY

Castor arrives.	Wanda is shocked to see him.

WANDA

Commander, what are you doing
here?

CASTOR
Where should I be?
(looks around)
Where's everyone else?

WANDA

Backing you up!	Didn't you track
Castor to the Parthenia Street
Terminal?

CASTOR

What?

WANDA
You radioed in your personal
security code.	Nobody knows that
code but you.

CASTOR

Obviously someone else knows it!
Get everybody back to their

posts -- now!


INT. ARCHER HOME - SUNSET

Archer tiptoes through the house -- listening. He sees Cop #2 sitting at the dining room table, cleaning his pistol. He slips upstairs -- toward the sound of
RUNNING WATER.


MASTER BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS ACTION

Archer walks in and steps toward the bathroom -- passing the bed. He stops. On top of the rumpled covers: Eve's nightgown and a pair of Castor's black briefs.

Overwhelmed, he sits down -- not noticing the water has stopped. Eve steps in from the bathroom.

ARCHER

Eve...
 

The look of horror on her face snaps him back to reality. She runs, but Archer grabs her. She struggles -- fighting and kicking him -- but somehow he keeps her mouth covered.

ARCHER

I'm not going to hurt you.	Just
don't scream, okay?
(no response)
Okay?

Terrified -- she finally nods and he eases off her.

EVE

I know you -- you're the one who
called.	You're Castor Troy.	You
killed my son --

ARCHER

--	I called, but I'm not Castor. I'm your husband.

Archer holds onto her as she struggles again.

ARCHER

Now, you're going to listen.	The
last time we saw each other -- was
in this room.	We had a fight
after I told you I had to go away.

(a beat)
My assignment -- Jon Archer's
assignment -- was to enter a
federal prison as Castor Troy.

Eve is startled by this intimate information but she reveals nothing. SIRENS approach the house, the cops are returning. She keeps an eye on the door. Playing for time.

EVE
How did he expect to do that?

ARCHER

An F.B.I. surgeon gave me Castor's
face.	He handled the transplant,
the vocal implant, everything.
But somehow Castor came out of his
coma -- and killed everyone who
knew about the mission.	But not
before he was transformed into me.
 
The back DOOR CLICKS open.	A voice booms out.

COP (O.S.)

Dr. Archer, are you okay?

ARCHER

If you need hard evidence, get it.
Your husband's blood type is O
negative.	Castor's is A.B.

Archer glances at the balcony -- as FOOTSTEPS CLOMP up the stairs. Eve is about to answer -- or scream. But then...

ARCHER

Remember the parachute dream?	I'm
falling, Eve... I'm falling...

The blood drains from her face as... Archer slips over the balcony and disappears.


INT. STUDY - LATER

Eve is at the computer -- dazed and disoriented. She snaps alert on hearing the front DOOR OPEN -- Castor is giving orders to the cops guarding the house.

CASTOR (O.S.)
I want you guys here around-the-
clock.	And stay off the lawn.

Eve feigns interest in her laptop as Castor enters. She tenses as he starts massaging her back.

CASTOR

You're all in knots.	Maybe
another date night will help you
relax...

EVE
Not tonight... I'm way behind in
my Continuing Ed.

He studies Eve, then grasps her firmly by the shoulders.

CASTOR

You think I've been acting
strange.	Like a completely
different person.

EVE
 
-- Yes.

CASTOR

Okay, I have a confession to make.
But you aren't going to like it...

Castor wraps his hands around her slender neck...

CASTOR (cont'd)
... I read your diary.	I've been
trying to change -- trying to be
more like the man you want me to
be.

Eve reacts to the explanation.	There is a logic to it.

CASTOR

And to prove it, I'm taking you
and Jamie away on a trip -- right
after the memorial service.

EVE

What memorial service?

CASTOR

Victor Lazarro had a heart
seizure... right in my office.	It
was horrible...

EVE

Oh, my God...

Castor pours it on -- feigning immense grief.

CASTOR
First Tito... now Victor...
(holds her tight)
... please don't tell me I'm going
to lose you, too...

EVE
(returns the embrace)
Of course not.


INT. ARCHER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Castor slumbers fitfully. Suddenly, his shoulder twitches, rousing him. He looks up to find Eve reading beside him.

CASTOR
 
What was that?

EVE

What was what?

CASTOR

Something bit me.

EVE

Probably a mosquito -- I'll close
the window.

Eve rubs Castor's shoulder blade until he falls asleep. She gets up, closes the window, then goes into the bathroom.


INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

Eve takes a breath, then produces a lancet from her pocket. She squeezes the lancet -- and a drop of blood splashes into a glass vial -- Castor's blood.


EXT. ARCHER HOME - NIGHT

As Eve gets the key in her car door -- a hand grabs her.
She stifles a scream -- then sees... the two COPS.

COP

Sorry, Dr. Archer.	Where are you
going at this hour?

EVE

There's been an emergency at the
hospital.

COP

One of us will have to escort you.

EVE
Fine...
(a beat)
But please don't wake my
husband... he's exhausted.


EXT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

Nothing happening here at 4 A.M. Nothing indeed. The bored Cop keeps watch outside -- as Eve hustles in.
 

INT. HOSPITAL - EVE'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Eve paces anxiously as the BLOOD ANALYZER CLICKS away.

EVE

Please be O-neg.	Please...

The MACHINE STOPS CLICKING.	It reads "Male -- Type AB."
She buries her face in her hands -- completely stunned.

ARCHER (O.S.)

Thanks for believing me.

Archer emerges from the darkness of her office -- but Eve pulls a pistol -- aiming it with calm authority.

ARCHER

What are you doing?	Where did you
get that gun?

EVE

I took it from my fake husband.

ARCHER

Why point it at me?	I'm the real
thing.

EVE
I don't know that.	Maybe Jon's
already dead.

ARCHER

What more proof do you need?

EVE

Tell me... tell me about the all-
night dentist.

As Archer speaks -- Eve searches his eyes for the truth.

ARCHER

... I took a date out for chicken
and ribs -- not knowing she was a
vegetarian.	When the night
couldn't get worse, she broke
her tooth on a pebble that got
into her three-bean salad
Somehow she and I had fun driving
around looking for an all-night
dentist...
(a beat)
 
And even though it must have hurt

-- you still kissed me.

Eve slowly puts the gun down, fighting off tears.

EVE

Christ, Jon!	How could you put us
in this position?	Do you know --
do you know what he did to me...?

ARCHER

Whatever happened, whatever he did

--	I know it's my fault and I know I can never make it up to you --

She pulls herself together -- regaining her composure.

EVE

But you're damn well going to try.
(a beat)
First -- how are we going to get
you out of this?


INT. ARCHER HOME - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

Castor wakes up and finds Eve gone. His eyes narrow as he touches the mosquito bite -- the one that isn't there.


INT. HOSPITAL - EVE'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Eve sifts through the supply cabinet and finds a yellow vial.

EVE

This will knock him out for hours.

ARCHER

Good.	What's his schedule
tomorrow?

EVE

He doesn't tell me anymore than
you ever did... All I know is --
tomorrow we're going to Victor's
memorial service.

ARCHER

Victor... Tito... they both died
thinking I killed them... And in a
way... I did.
 

EVE

Jon -- you can't think about that
now.

Archer takes a breath -- and pulls himself together.

ARCHER

-- What happens after the memorial?

EVE

He's taking Jamie and me away.

ARCHER

And neither of you will be coming

back.	Where's the service?

EVE

Saint Mary's-By-The-Sea.

Archer reacts... the irony's not lost on him.

EVE
What are you going to do?

ARCHER

Hit him with a trank dart.	Once
he's unconscious -- I'll try to
get to Buzz and Wanda before the
security team gets to me.

EVE

What else can I do?

ARCHER
Think up a good excuse.	I don't
want you or Jamie anywhere near
that service.

EVE

I can cover for Jamie.	But if I'm
not there, he'll suspect

something...
(as Archer
considers)
The second you make your move, all
hell's going to break loose.	If
I'm there beside him -- I can take
charge.	I'm his wife, remember?
(a beat)
There's no way around it -- for
once, you need me.
 

Archer looks into her eyes -- the regrets flooding over.

ARCHER
I've always needed you...

They embrace... soaking up each other's warmth.

EVE

Jon -- what are the odds?

ARCHER

Terrible.	But it's the best we
can do with what we have.
(a beat)

If it doesn't happen, take Jamie
and don't look back...

EVE

It'll happen.

FOOTSTEPS APPROACH -- they break their embrace.

ARCHER

Do doctors travel in packs?

EVE

Only when we're golfing.


INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Castor and the twins round the bend -- just in time to see the door to the burn ward close.


INT. BURN WARD - NIGHT

Eve quickly wraps gauze around a patient's head -- when Castor and his boys rush in, guns leveled.

EVE

Jon!	What are you doing here?

CASTOR

That's what you're going to
explain to me.

EVE

Didn't the police tell you?	There
was an emergency.
 
Lars starts pulling at the patient's bandages.

EVE

Jon -- stop it!	Mr. Alandro is
very ill!

CASTOR

Not as ill as he's going to be...

He blanches as Lars reveals a scarred burn victim -- Mr.
Alandro.	Eve is livid as she attends to the patient.

CASTOR

Sorry.	But what's a guy to think
when his wife runs off in the

middle of the night?

EVE

It's my fault.	I should've woken
you up before I left.
(kisses him)
Now please let me get back to
work.

They leave.	Eve wipes his ugly taste from her mouth.


EXT. HOSPITAL PARKING LOT - DAWN

Castor gets into his car as he confabs with the twins.

CASTOR

Stay here.	Watch her like a hawk.

LARS
Think she knows?

CASTOR

Who cares?	She's going to be dead
by tonight anyway.	They're all
going to be dead.	The wife, the
kid... and the father.


EXT. OLD RANCH - HIGH GRASS - DAY

Archer waits as Sasha appears with a long case. In the b.g., Adam plays on the Ranch House porch with Dietrich.

ARCHER

How's the boy?
 
SASHA

His ears are still ringing -- but
he'll be okay.

Archer opens the case.	Inside is a sniper rifle.

SASHA

The truck's all gassed up.
Look, Caz, there'll be F.B.I.
agents all over that place.	Maybe
I can talk my brother into helping
us.

ARCHER

'Us'?	No, Sasha -- believe me,

this isn't your fight.

He turns to leave -- but her look draws him back. He kisses her -- not passionately, but nobly.

ARCHER

Thanks...

She watches him as he walks off toward the truck.


EXT. ARCHER'S HOME - DAY

Dressed in staid black, Eve joins Castor at the limo.

CASTOR

Where's Jamie?

EVE

That's what I'd like to know.	She
stole fifty dollars from my purse
and took off.

Castor's eyes narrow -- trying to read Eve.

EVE
Don't act so stunned, Jon.	You
know how hard it is to get that
girl into a dress.

CASTOR

I'll deal with her later.

EVE

Good.	Because I am fed up.
 
EXT. ST. MARY'S-BY-THE-SEA - DAY

A crucifix gleams in the sun... and anchoring the crucifix is... a headstone.

Like so many others -- except this headstone is Matthew Archer's. And hidden behind it is -- Jon Archer. He finishes assembling the sniper rifle.

For a moment he acknowledges Matthew's grave... the regrets giving way to determination. He looks down from his vantage point onto --


EXT. SEA-SIDE - DAY

At the foot of the cemetery knoll. Rows of chairs... white flowers... mourners. A yacht is docked at the breakwater.

INTERCUT WITH:


ARCHER'S POV THROUGH SCOPE

peers down through scope -- seeing...

Castor and Eve as they emerge from their limo.

Eve glances around, searching for Archer. She comes eye-to-eye with Lars -- who is watching her every move.

Archer TRACKS Castor and Eve as they sit in the front row. The ceremony begins.

PRIEST

We are here to celebrate the life
of Victor Lazarro.	We all know
him as a man who dedicated himself
to defending this great nation --
first, as a highly decorated
admiral -- then, as west coast

director of the F.B.I.	But not
all of you know what a deeply
spiritual man he was.	It was his
wish that his Requiem Mass be
performed in Latin.
(a beat)
In Nomine Patris, et Filii et
Spiritus Sancti.	Amen...

The PRIEST begins to recite a beautiful and somber mass.
 


ARCHER

fills the trank-dart with sedative.


PRIEST

continues the solemn ritual.

PRIEST

Domine, de morte aeterna, in
die illa tremenda quando caeli
movendi sunt et terra...


EVE

checks her watch... barely lifting her eyes away...

Castor absently pats her knee. She's forced to return focus to the service.


ARCHER

chambers the dart, twists a knob on the range-finder, and carefully peers over the crucifix.


THROUGH SCOPE

Archer TRACKS THROUGH the mourners -- and FINDS Castor.
As the cross-hairs neatly cube his head...


BACK TO SCENE

We've come full circle from Matthew's death: with Archer the sniper and Castor the target.

The Priest's emotional reciting of the rites climaxes.

PRIEST

Requiem aeternam dona eis,
Domine... Amen.


FULL SCREEN - TRIGGER

Archer's finger wraps around -- he starts to squeeze...
 


POV THROUGH SCOPE - FIGURE

crosses behind Castor, blocking Archer's shot. Archer's finger freezes -- as the figure turns -- hair tumbling away from her face. It's Jamie.


AT SERVICE

Eve stiffens as Jamie sits down.

JAMIE

Thanks anyway, Mom --

(slides her $50)
But I wanted to be here for you...
and Dad.

Castor reads the panic on Eve's face, but says nothing.

He simply takes Jamie's hand, intertwining his fingers in hers.

The honor guard steps forward, shouldering their rifles, commencing their 21-GUN SALUTE as --


ARCHER

steadies himself, re-aims the sniper rifle.
 

He hears MOTION behind him. but this is his only chance. squeezes --
 


Someone's coming and fast...
Off-balance, Archer

 

THFFFT! The SILENCED TRANK-DART explodes from the barrel.


FOLLOW DART

Screaming toward Castor's neck -- but it goes just wide. It sinks harmlessly into the grass -- unnoticed during the 21-GUN SALUTE.


ON KNOLL

THUMP! Archer is cracked across the head. He slumps down, unconscious, as a silenced gun barrel gently enters his ear. As the saluting GUNS FIRE in the b.g. -- we
 
don't know when, or if, this pistol fires...


AT SEA-SIDE SERVICE

The honor guard presents the urn to Mrs. Lazarro. Fearful, Eve chances a glance around -- wondering what's gone wrong.

PRIEST
The admiral's family will now take
his ashes to the sea...

As Mrs. Lazarro and her grown children proceed to the docked yacht, Castor touches his ear-phone... getting a message.

His eyes alight on a boathouse... adjacent to the service.

CASTOR

(into headset)
Lars -- take Jamie, bring the car
around, then meet us at that
boathouse...

Guests head for their cars. Eve seizes the moment and steps over to Wanda and Buzz.

EVE

Wanda -- I need to talk to you.

WANDA

(reads her face)
Sure... what's wrong?

But then Eve looks past Wanda -- and sees Lars looking at her -- tightening his "friendly" grip on Jamie's shoulder.

EVE
Never mind --

CASTOR

Come on, baby.	I've got a
surprise for you.

Wanda and Buzz watch as they head up toward the boathouse.
 


INT. BOATHOUSE - DAY
 

Dim, deserted.	Filled with boat parts, tools, etc.
Castor hustles Eve inside and locks the door behind him.

Lunt is there -- standing over a beaten Archer. Eve gasps.

CASTOR

Look who we caught creeping around
-- Castor Troy.

EVE

Why is he here?

CASTOR

Before I turn him in, I thought
we'd pay him back for everything
he's put us through...

Castor starts kicking Archer.	Over and over in the gut.

CASTOR

Come on, baby.	Join the fun --

Eve can't stand it. She charges Castor -- but he immediately subdues her.

CASTOR

Too bad.	Part of me was hoping
you didn't know.

He throws her down beside Archer.	She clings to him.

CASTOR

Did you really think it would be
that easy, you dumb fucks?
(to Eve)
Sorry, baby.	Castor Troy is about
to murder you and our daughter...
but I promise you won't die
unavenged.

ARCHER

This is between you and me.	Leave
them out of this.

CASTOR

It was between you and me.	Even
your little boy -- that wasn't
supposed to happen.	But you
couldn't let it go.
 
ARCHER

No father could.

CASTOR
Appealing to my sense of 'family'
won't work, Jon.	I thought you
knew me better than that

Archer plays for time -- looking for some edge. He sees a crate filled with block-and-tackle amid the shop's tools.

ARCHER

I know some things that even you
don't know, Caz.	You have a son.

I've met him.	His name is Adam...

CASTOR

I imagine I've got a dozen kids --
so what?
(cocks pistol)
No more head games... First your
wife dies.	Then your daughter.
Then you.

Castor smiles as the DOOR CREAKS open.

CASTOR

Just one big happy family...

But it's not Jamie and Lars. Three people emerge from the shadows, machine pistols poised.

CASTOR

Dietrich -- Aldo -- Sasha?

DIETRICH

That's right, Archer.	Now drop
'em.

No options.	Castor and Lunt drop their weapons.


EXT. BOATHOUSE - SIDE ENTRANCE - DAY

Lars and Jamie pull up in the car. Lars listens to his headset -- knows something is wrong.

LARS

Don't fucking move...
 
INT. BOATHOUSE - DAY

Sasha's at Archer's side.

SASHA

Caz -- are you okay?

CASTOR

You're making a mistake.	I'm
Castor -- he's Archer.	Sasha,
baby -- just give me a minute to
explain!

SASHA

That's pathetic, Archer.	But

then, your terrible sense of humor
is legendary.

ALDO

(cocks GUN)
It's pay-back time.

Aldo aims at Castor when BOOM!	He's blown apart.

Lars charges in -- BLASTING.

Archer grabs a block-and-tackle as --

Lunt dives for Aldo's fallen machine-pistol. Archer swings the block-and-tackle -- whacking Lunt across the head.

Castor scoops up his pistol but Eve kicks him hard in the balls. He doubles over.

Archer snatches away the MACHINE PISTOL. Staggered -- Lunt is quickly riddled by Dietrich.

Castor and Lars BLAZE at the now-scattering intruders -- driving them back amid the shot's tools and drums.

ARCHER

Find Jamie!

Eve crawls through the FUSILLADE toward the exit.


EXT. MEMORIAL SERVICE - DAY

Among the last to leave -- Buzz and Wanda snap alert. Over the CRASHING of the WAVES -- did Wanda hear something?
 


EXT. BOATHOUSE - DAY

Eve rushes to the car -- it's empty.	Jamie is gone.

EVE

Jamie?	Jamie!

BULLETS SHRED the WINDOWS behind her.


INT. BOATHOUSE - DAY

During the GUN BATTLE -- we INTERCUT the deaths of

Dietrich, Lars and Sasha WITH:


EXT. SEA - LAZARRO'S ASHES

being scattered at sea.

Castor and Lars RIDDLE Sasha. She drops. Archer FIRES back -- killing Lars and driving Castor back.

Archer leans beside the mortally-wounded Sasha.

SASHA

... Help Adam... don't let him end
up like us...

She dies in his arms.	Wounded, Dietrich crawls over.
Seeing his sister, Dietrich rises in horror...

DIETRICH
Sasha -- !

BOOM BOOM BOOM! Castor wastes Dietrich. Archer BLASTS back -- driving Castor outside. Archer pursues.


EXT. MEMORIAL SERVICE - DAY

Eve runs smack into Wanda and Buzz -- they're on the run.

WANDA

We heard gunshots --

EVE

Wanda, I've got to tell you
something.	Something crazy...
 

EXT. BOATHOUSE YARD - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY

Archer emerges into the maze of dry-docked boats.
Silently checking his clip, he discards the empty gun.

Castor moves stealthily through the narrow paths.
Hearing a NOISE behind him --

BOOM! Castor FIRES -- blowing apart an under-repair hull. He advances toward the boat, gun ready, when Archer appears behind him and follows -- one step, two steps -- until --

Castor stops -- then whirls as Archer leaps.

The men collapse hard. Castor's pistol clatters across the yard toward the docked boat.

Archer and Castor brutally strangle each other -- digging their fingers deep into their throats. They throttle each other so hard, Archer's larynx vocal chip is dislodged.

His VOICE CHANGES, ECHOING with garbled.	STATIC.

ARCHER

Give up, Castor.	People are going
to find out.

CASTOR

Not if I kill you first.

They scramble for the gun -- but a hand reaches out from the docked boat and picks it up. Archer and Castor stop dead in their tracks because --

Jamie appears, holding the pistol.

CASTOR

Give it here, Jamie.

ARCHER

No, Jamie.	Don't do it!

Everybody gawks -- because Archer and Castor are now...

Both speaking in Archer's true voice.

And nobody is more confused than Jamie.

ARCHER
 
Listen to my voice, Jamie.	I'm

your father.

CASTOR
It's a trick, Jamie.	I'm your
father.

Jamie swings the gun back and forth -- baffled.

CASTOR
Shoot him, Jamie.

ARCHER

Jamie...

CASTOR
Shoot him!

Jamie FIRES. Archer reels -- as a slug grazes his shoulder. Castor snatches the PISTOL from Jamie's hand.

CASTOR

You dunce.	No kid of mine would
miss so badly.

He aims the gun at Archer's head.

WANDA (O.S.)

Hold it.

Wanda and Buzz have burst onto the terrace -- their guns leveled. Eve and more agents are right behind.

CASTOR

Just saving the taxpayers the cost
of a trial.	So take a hike.

WANDA

You're both under arrest until a
D.N.A. test proves who's who.

CASTOR

I'm ordering you to back off!

Several agents waver -- unsure.	But not Wanda and Buzz.

WANDA

Put the gun down --

BUZZ

-- Now!
 
CASTOR

(beat)
Can't blame me for trying.

He grabs a shocked Jamie -- shoving the gun under her chin.

Archer struggles to his feet as --

Castor -- using Jamie as a shield -- backs out the gate to the garden. Archer follows -- cautiously.

CASTOR

Say goodbye to Daddy --

Jamie whips out the switchblade -- sinks it into Castor's thigh and twists. She dives away. FIRING wildly, Castor staggers back through the gate.

CASTOR (O.S.)

You ungrateful delinquent!


OUTSIDE GATE


As Castor turns and staggers away -- he runs smack into a confused security agent.

CASTOR

Give me your weapon -- now!

The agent hands over his UZI -- and Castor PLUGS him.


BOATYARD

Archer and Eve make sure Jamie's okay.

JAMIE

(to Archer)
Who are you?	Will someone please

tell me what's going on?

Archer rushes to the gate and hauls it open.


CASTOR

limps away from the boatyard, towards the slips -- alive with sunbathers and yachters.
 

EXT. MARINA DOCKS - DAY

Castor hustles along until he finds what he's looking for --

Twin Cigarette BOATS -- racing boats -- being TUNED UP by their suntanned crews. He jumps into one of the boats.

BOAT CAPTAIN
Hey -- !

Without even looking, Castor SHOOTS the guy dead. In a flash -- Castor THROTTLES up the BOAT. He sees --


CASTOR'S POV

Archer running down the dock toward the adjoining boat.


CASTOR

FIRES -- peppering the dock.

Archer knocks the boat owner to safety -- as the BAIT HOUSE BLOWS UP behind him. Archer rolls into the boat --
FIRING.

Castor's hit! A slug grazes his shoulder. He grabs the THROTTLE -- taking off.


ARCHER

FIRES UP the second BOAT -- in pursuit. Castor BLASTS back -- SHATTERING Archer's BOAT COMPASS.


CIVILIAN BOAT

speeds toward him -- causing a near-miss.


ANOTHER ANGLE

Running parallel, Archer and Castor BLAST at EACH OTHER at point-blank range. Their boats smash and pound each other.

A police boat closes in on them.
 

Castor FIRES at the police -- obliterating both crew and boat. The POLICE BOAT'S rear SMASHES into Archer's craft.

Archer's BOAT plows up and through the other. EXPLOSION! Momentum carries Archer across -- and back into the water.

The boat lands right next to Castor's.

Archer and Castor resume their battering... approaching a --


TUG

pulling a barge.

Castor forces Archer into its path. At the last moment...

Archer leaps onto the bow of Castor's boat as --

KA-BOOM! Archer's boat crashes into the BARGE which EXPLODES.


CASTOR

swerves wildly -- trying to throw Archer off.

Archer can only watch as Castor reaches for another clip.

But the boat hits a wave...

Castor loses the gun -- which skids away. Archer slips, his head hanging over the side. Castor tries to ram Archer, but he pulls himself up just in time.

Castor grabs the anchor -- swings it. WHUNK! It sinks into the deck beside Archer -- but the chain is around his neck.

As Castor tries to strangle him -- Archer headbutts
Castor, who reels -- snagging his leg around the chain.
Castor falls back -- plunging toward the water.

Archer tries to hold Castor up... as the boat speeds toward --
 


PIER
 

Archer yanks Castor back onto the deck as the BOAT BOUNCES OFF the pier pilings. But as they slug it out...


ANOTHER ANGLE

WHAM! The BOAT careens off a piling -- and ROARS straight for the shipyard. COLLIDING with a shoreline obstruction --

The BOAT FLIPS, stern over bow...

Archer and Castor go flying... onto the beach.


EXT. BEACH - DAY

Archer and Castor lie dazed... then stir. Castor sees the pistol lying half-buried... he reaches for it. But --

Archer gets it first.	He aims it at Castor as they rise.

CASTOR

You won't shoot me, Jon.	I'm
unarmed...

ARCHER
Okay, I have a confession to
make... but you aren't gonna like
it... You're right, I won't shoot
you.	Not in the face anyway.

BOOM -- Archer SHOOTS Castor in the chest! He jerks and reels -- dropping to his knees. He looks at Archer in total disbelief. Then he sinks to the ground and lies still.

Exhausted, Archer lets the empty gun drop. Then he turns and sees an FBI chopper heading his way. Relieved, he turns back to Castor, but -- Castor's body is gone!

Castor is crawling toward the flipped boat's spinning stabilizing screw. Archer FIRES -- hitting Castor in the leg. He buckles... but keeps going.

Archer leaps on him -- they struggle as Castor tries to bury his face on the spinning blade.

CASTOR

It'll never be over, Jon... every
 
time you look in the mirror...

you'll see my face...

They struggle as the propeller blade. gets closer, closer -- slicing into "Archer's" cheek. At the last instant...

Archer reaches the anchor-chain. He wraps it around the screw -- stopping the whirling blades.

Castor finally sinks to the ground -- and no longer moves.

Archer takes Castor's hand -- trying to tug off his wedding ring. Just when he almost has it off -- Castor suddenly grabs Archer's wrist and holds it tight.

Eye contact between the two men. Castor smirks, his grasp slackening... as he finally fades away. Archer lets Castor's hand drop, then slides the ring on his own finger.


ANOTHER ANGLE

The chopper lands.	Buzz and Wanda rush over.

BUZZ

You okay, Archer?

ARCHER

What did you call me?

WANDA

He called you 'Archer' -- sir.

Archer finally realizes -- they actually mean him. He smiles -- Jon Archer's long lost smile.


EXT. SHIPYARD - SUNSET

FBI med-teams strap Archer onto a gurney. Castor's inert body is beside him.

EVE

Hang on, Jon... they're bringing
in their top surgical team from
D.C...

ARCHER

(re:	Castor)
 
How is he?

EVE

No life signs at all.	He's a
turnip.

ARCHER

That's what they always say...

He passes out as the FBI medics load him onto the med-evac chopper. Wanda prevents Eve from climbing aboard.

WANDA

I'm sorry, Eve.	You can't come.
(to Buzz)

Take her home.

EVE

But he's my husband!

WANDA

But he works for us.

Wanda gets on the med-evac chopper; it lifts off, leaving a furious Eve and a confused Jamie behind.

JAMIE

Will Dad be Dad again?

EVE

I hope so, honey.

JAMIE

And you guys say my life is
screwed up...

In the swirl of dust, they watch the chopper fly away.


INT. ARCHER'S HOUSE - DAY

Maybe days, maybe weeks later -- no way to tell. Eve is at the dining room table, catching up on medical reports.

Sensing something, she looks up and sees a silhouette at the front screen door -- a man's silhouette.

ARCHER (O.S.)
Hello, Eve.

Pulse pounding, Eve frantically pushes open the door to glimpse the face of the man with Archer's voice.
 

It's Jon Archer.	Eve stares -- then touches his face
carefully, tenderly -- around the tiny residual scar.
Then, she pulls him tight -- holding on for dear life.

JAMIE (O.S.)

Dad?

Jamie is there. Archer smiles -- gently, almost sadly -- with a softness and genuineness that Castor Troy could never feel, could never fake.

She rushes to him. The whole family hangs on, hugging and kissing -- for the first time ever, really together.

JAMIE
I'm sorry I shot you, Dad.	Am I
grounded?

Archer smiles and holds her tighter. But as they draw Archer inside, he hesitates.

ARCHER
I have something to ask you -- to
ask both of you...

He steps aside -- revealing Castor's son.

ARCHER
This is Adam.	He needs a place to
live... just for a little while.

Eve looks at Archer -- she sees what this means to him and, what the hell, there's plenty of time now to talk.


EXT. ARCHER'S HOME - CONTINUOUS ACTION - DAY

As the family heads inside, the door closes, shutting us out.

DISSOLVE TO:


INT. MATTHEW'S OLD ROOM - NIGHT

Archer gives Adam an old teddy bear -- rocking the child until he finally drifts off into dreamland.


INT. JAMIE'S ROOM - NIGHT
 

Archer watches Jamie sleep. He draws the comforter over her -- she stirs, and pulls it in tighter.


INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

Eve gets undressed... waiting for Archer.

EVE

How was your first day back?

No reply... Eve hears WATER RUNNING. She approaches Archer, who's bent over the sink, washing his face.

EVE

Jon?

Archer stands up -- revealing Castor's face in the bathroom mirror. Eve chokes back a scream.

Archer turns and faces her -- with his true face. He sees her terrified expression, turns back to the mirror

--	and sees his own face looking at him. But he understands.

He embraces Eve... holds her tight. She responds, happy to have him home again. We STAY ON his familiar smile and...
