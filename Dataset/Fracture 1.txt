CREDITS SEQUENCE: EXTREME CLOSE-UPS

An unfinished mechanical device: a scaffold of thin metal pipes, levers, pulleys, wiring, serve-motors.

THOMAS CRAWFORD works on it: in his 40s, well-dressed but in disarray, graying stubble, hair and clothes unkempt. Magnifying glasses distort his eyes, making them huge and strange.

He sets aside a tool, takes a marble-sized ball-bearing and drops it into a slot at the top of the device.

His enlarged eyes follow the metal ball -

- as it rolls and flips and spirals through a Rube-Goldberg-style maze, setting off bells, clicking past turnstiles -

-	then missing a leap and clattering across the work-table. Eyes on the device, Crawford’s hand traps the ball.

He stays still, analyzing.

He selects a tiny screwdriver from a neat array of metal-working and electronics tools. Makes a miniscule adjustment to a single joint. Drops in another ball.

It rolls and flips and spirals all the way down.

Crawford doesn’t react.	Just studies the machine.

Behind him, on a desk: a framed photograph of a beautiful woman in her mid-30s.

His wife.


INT. LUXURY BEACH-HOTEL ROOM - THE SAME TIME

JENNIFER CRAWFORD is just reaching orgasm -

- with ROB NUNALLY: mid-30s, good-looking, aging-boyish.

They clutch each other, shuddering, lost in passion. And then, breathing heavily, caressing each other - Nunally rolls off her - slowly coming back to earth.

Jennifer studies her lover, a quiet play of relief and gratitude and satisfaction on her face -

-	darkened by a troubled distance, maybe even fear. She is, after all, having an affair.

INT. CRAWFORD’S OFFICE - DAY

Crawford stares through the grotesque lenses, motionless, expressionless.

He takes a deep breath and checks his watch. Then he stands, removing the glasses.

We now see his office: large, austere. Decor and equipment related to aircraft engineering. Outside big windows, jets take off from an industrial airstrip.

Crawford gets a brand-new bottle of Jack Daniels from a desk drawer, uncaps it and swigs as he opens the door to a private bathroom.

He gargles, spits into the sink. He pours out more, then puts the half-empty bottle back on his desk.

He collects a home-made device from the workbench: it looks like a PDA connected by wires to a blank credit card.

He puts it in the pocket of his suit jacket, which he sets on the desk. Adjusts the placement of the open bottle, nearby.

Crawford goes to a light-box, studying a set of large X-rays:
dark strips of welding in a grayish fuzz of metal.

TINA, his assistant, appears in the doorway.

TINA
The N.T.S.B. guys are here.

CRAWFORD
(Doesn’t look up)
Yep.

She hesitates a second, glancing at the bottle.

Crawford ignores her, pulling an x-ray off the light-box and grabbing his jacket -

-	which knocks over the bottle. It skitters across the desk, liquor spilling.

Crawford just walks out past Tina.


INT. AIRPLANE HANGER - SOON AFTER

The twisted, torn and burned wreckage of a large private jet is being reassembled on the big empty concrete floor.
 
3


N.T.S.B. INVESTIGATORS in shirtsleeves and AIRCRAFT COMPANY EXECUTIVES in suits cluster around work-boards covered with photographs and diagrams of a crash site.

They look up, falling silent, as Crawford comes in carrying the X-ray. A few exchange surprised, concerned glances; this is not a man who skips a shave.

But when he gets to them, Crawford is laser-like - holding the X-ray and pointing to a spot three inches above it:

CRAWFORD
It’s here.

He hands a startled Investigator the film and strides off toward the giant open doors out to the airfield.

His foot knocks a piece of the carefully-laid-out wreckage in passing; it clatters across the concrete, but Crawford doesn’t slow or look back.


INT. LUXURY BEACH-HOTEL ROOM - SOON AFTER

Rob is still in the bed, naked under the sheet - watching Jennifer adjust the straps of her bathing suit.

ROB
What about dinner tonight?

She looks at him, surprised. Smiles, comes to sit beside him. Gently:

JENNIFER
We go out to dinner - we might never come back.

Beat.	Rob nods.

ROB
Okay.
(Beat)

I want to wake up with you. I want to...

He gropes for words, but it’s too big and he relents - scales back, sighing:

ROB
...at least see where you live.

She regards him tenderly, feeling the same reckless yearning.
But also fear.	She rubs his hair.
 
4


JENNIFER
I live...here.

She leans over to kiss him delicately on the lips.


EXT. SANTA MONICA STREET - DAY

A black Porsche speeds down a quiet street near the beach, pulls into a parking space.

Crawford gets out, goes to a pay phone. He puts his cell phone on top of it, drops in some change and dials.

OPERATOR (ON PHONE)
L.A.P.D.

CRAWFORD
Lieutenant Nunally, please.

He listens to hold music and checks the time.

OPERATOR (ON PHONE)
He doesn’t come on til six. You want his voice mail?

CRAWFORD
No.	Thank you.
(beat)
I’ll see him later.

He hangs up, grabs his cell, and takes off down the sidewalk.


INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY

Crawford enters. He knows where he’s going - past the front desk and outside to the -


EXT. HOTEL POOL - DAY

Jennifer swims laps with strong, even strokes. Rob is enjoying the sun in a lounge chair.

Crawford eyes them as he passes on the other side of a low fence. Unnoticed, he heads upstairs.
 
5


INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - DAY

Crawford stops at a room with a DO NOT DISTURB sign on the knob. He takes out his PDA-device and slides its card into the key-card slot of the lock.

The lock clicks to green.


INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

Crawford enters, quietly closing the door behind him.

He just stands there, taking it all in. The unmade bed, the ripped-open condom packet, the clothes on the floor.

He is silent.	Very still.


EXT. CRAWFORD’S STREET - LATER

Jennifer drives her Mercedes convertible past expensive houses in the late-afternoon light.

She goes up the driveway of the Crawfords’ stark mordern home.

Across the street, MR. GIFFORD is playing catch with his GRANDSON. He waves to Jennifer.

She waves back, friendly but distracted, on her way to the front door.


INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Cold. Elegant. Metal planters with bamboo trees. Glass doors out to a back garden. A fire in the fireplace.

In a corner is another of Crawford’s Rube Goldbergs - this one the size of a refrigerator. On a coffee table in the center of the room, a big wooden bowl of ball-bearings.

Jennifer hurries in, dropping her keys on a table and -

- freezes, startled.

Crawford waits in the center of the room; despite the outer "disarray", he is calm and focused.

JENNIFER
You’re - home early.
 
6


CRAWFORD
I just felt a sudden urge.

JENNIFER
Are you...okay?

Crawford shrugs, smiling strangely.	He looks pained.

CRAWFORD
I could use a hug.

Jennifer submits guiltily.	Crawford embraces her, tight.
She waits it out, until:

JENNIFER
Have you been drinking?

He lets go and she steps back.	Studying him.	Scared.

CRAWFORD
I’ve been watching you sleep. At night.

JENNIFER
(Gently)
That’s creepy.

CRAWFORD
Sometimes when I’m at work, I’ll start thinking about you and I’ll just get - just - overwhelmed.

JENNIFER
Tommy -

CRAWFORD
It’s a dense, crushing -
geophysical force.	Like I’m
pinned.	At the core - where things
change.
(beat)
You ever get that way about me,
Jen?

JENNIFER
What are you talking about?

CRAWFORD
I’m trying to describe my feelings.

JENNIFER
Those don’t sound like feelings.
 
7


CRAWFORD
No?
(Beat)

What’s the sound of one feeling...in a forest?

JENNIFER
You think you’re so much smarter than I am. That must make you feel very powerful.

CRAWFORD
Helpless, actually.

Silence.

JENNIFER
Okay.	Maybe it’s time to really talk.

CRAWFORD
No.

JENNIFER
No?

He shakes his head.	Frayed and worn, she sighs.

JENNIFER
Fine. Whatever. I’ll make you some dinner.

He watches her turn and head for the kitchen.	To her back:

CRAWFORD
I know.	Everything.

She stops, exhales. Looking down. Afraid. Grateful it’s happening at last.

JENNIFER
I’m so sorry.

CRAWFORD
Don’t be. Knowledge is pain. I’m used to that.

Jennifer winces, feeling some sympathy. Preparing herself to turn and end it, to grow, to move on.

CRAWFORD
It’s not like I don’t let little pleasures, in return for the pain.
 
8


She frowns and turns - and her eyes go big with fear.

Crawford is holding a semi-automatic pistol, aimed at her face. Very still.

The gunshot explodes out of the muzzle - bright, harsh, loud.


EXT. GIFFORD HOUSE - FRONT YARD - CONTINUOUS

Gifford and his Grandson turn to look at the Crawford house.


INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Crawford stands, tilting his head to watch the slow hypnotic curl of smoke leaking from the gun in his extended hand. The hand, we might notice now, wears a surgical glove.

He lowers the gun, bends to pick up the ejected shell-casing from the floor. He wipes it and tosses it aside, on his way to Jennifer.

He stands looking down at her: face-up on the floor, head in a small pool of blood, eyes and mouth open.

The doorbell rings.


EXT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Gifford leans on the frosted-glass panel next to the door - hands cupped around his eyes, trying to see in.

GIFFORD
Tom?	Jen?	Everything okay in there?


INT. CRAWFORD FOYER - CONTINUOUS

Crawford steps in from the living room.

CRAWFORD
Everybody just LEAVE US ALONE!

He calmly aims up at the frosted-glass transom and fires three times - watching Gifford fling himself away.

Crawford collects the shell casings, wipes them, drops them back on the floor.

Peeling off the rubber gloves, he crosses to the fireplace and throws them into the flames. They curl and blacken.
 
9


Crawford watches, expressionless - then looks around, satisfied. Waiting.


EXT. CRAWFORD’S STREET - DUSK

Helicopters overhead, SWAT teams setting up. Nearby houses have been emptied, gawking NEIGHBORS and media vans moved back to a block away.

UNIFORM COPS pull aside the barriers as a plain-wrap sedan rolls through. It pulls up by the SWAT Command Truck.

ROB NUNALLY gets out, surveying the scene. The guy who spent his afternoon with Jennifer Crawford in the hotel is an L.A.P.D. Detective.

SWAT COMMANDER
You the Negotiator?

NUNALLY
Yeah.	What do we know?


INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - SOON AFTER

Crawford waits, with the gun.	The phone rings.	He picks up:

CRAWFORD
Yes?

INTERCUT WITH:


EXT. CRAWFORD’S STREET - CONTINUOUS

Nunally is standing by the open trunk of his sedan, wearing a Kevlar vest now - putting on his shoulder-holster over it. Into his cell-phone:

NUNALLY
Mr. Crawford?

CRAWFORD
Who is this?

NUNALLY
My name is Lieutenant Robert Nunally.
I’m a hostage negotiator for the Los -

Crawford hangs up.	Thoughtful.
 
10


NUNALLY
Mr. Crawford?

Nunally grimaces, shuts his phone, shaking his head. But then he turns - with the SWAT Commander and everyone else -

-	as Crawford’s front door unlocks and opens a few inches. Nunally considers this, looks at the SWAT COMMANDER.

NUNALLY
Okay then.	Here we go.

He pulls his suit jacket back on, then reaches into the trunk for his back-up gun. He tucks it into the back of his belt, concealed under the jacket.

He takes a walkie-talkie and starts for the house.

The spectators fall silent. Radios crackle and hiss as he heads up the driveway.


INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Crawford watches Nunally’s silhouette appear on the frosted glass, from across the living room.

NUNALLY (O.S.)
Mr. Crawford?

The door pushes open very slowly. Nunally stays in the doorway.

NUNALLY
Hey.

Crawford studies him, staying back.

CRAWFORD
Get rid of the vampires.

Nunally is confused; Crawford gestures at the flood-lit lawn outside. Nunally glances back, sees the SWAT teams and - down the street - the distant barricades, the media.

He nods, steps in and lets the door shut.	Careful silence.

CRAWFORD
Do I call you Rob?

NUNALLY
If you want.
 
11


CRAWFORD
Not vampires.

NUNALLY
What?

CRAWFORD
Not vampires.	Ghouls.	Sorry.

Nunally nods, humoring him, glancing around. Sees the small pool of blood where Jennifer fell. Plays it cool.

NUNALLY
Mr. Crawford, what do you say you give me the gun - so I can pay more attention to what you’re saying?

Crawford sighs.

CRAWFORD
Is that your best shot?
(Beat)
So to speak.

NUNALLY
I just think - maybe it would -

CRAWFORD
Tell you what: I will if you will.

Nunally frowns, wary.

Crawford moves to the coffee table in the center of the room, holds his gun out over it.

CRAWFORD
We both put down our guns. At the same time.

Crawford gestures to a chair across the room - by the foyer door, near Nunally.

CRAWFORD
We set them down and step away.
(Beat)

Then you can "pay more attention" to what I’m saying.

Nunally studies Crawford...and the gun, hovering above the coffee table. Looking for a trick, a catch. But there isn’t one. If Crawford sets down his gun and steps away, he’ll be standing in the open center of the room.
 
12


CRAWFORD
Happy ending, then.

Nunally stares Crawford in the eyes -

- then slowly takes his gun from his shoulder holster.

Eyes on each other from across the room - moving very slowly - the two men cautiously set down their guns -

- and step away.	Crawford smiles.

Nunally smiles, too, reassuring and false. Begins to edge forward - alert to the possibility of a lunge for the gun or having another weapon. But Crawford stays absolutely still.

NUNALLY
Mr. Crawford, your neighbor mentioned that your wife -

CRAWFORD
It’s Tom.

NUNALLY
I’m sorry?

CRAWFORD
You can call me Tom.

NUNALLY
Tom.	Your wife.	Is she here?

CRAWFORD
Yes.

Crawford gestures to a library alcove, behind him, out of view.

NUNALLY
Is she all right?

Nunally begins to drift slowly to the side, to see.

CRAWFORD
I don’t think she is.	I shot her,
Rob.

Nunally’s nodding, edging to look into the alcove -

NUNALLY
You shot your wife.
 
13


CRAWFORD
It was like I just suddenly - snapped.
We were arguing - and I got the gun.

NUNALLY
- okay - I hear you -

CRAWFORD
And I shot her in the head. I know it was wrong.
(Beat)
Are you listening to me?

But Nunally is not. He’s frozen - staring, shocked, at the back wall of the alcove - which he can now see.

There’s a big framed black-white photograph: a portrait of Jennifer Crawford.

NUNALLY
Oh Jesus Christ.

Nunally fumbles for his walkie-talkie, rushing past Crawford toward the alcove -

- kneeling by Jennifer, who lies, face-up in a red puddle -

NUNALLY
(into walkie-talkie)

We need a medic in here! Get the ambulance up! RIGHT NOW! NOW! NOW!

Nunally feels her neck frantically for a pulse - looking in her open, vacant eyes for some sign -

NUNALLY
Oh no - God no - I can’t - get a -

Nunally desperately starts C.P.R., his hands getting bloody. He stops to check her neck for a pulse now and then -

-	as Crawford slowly approaches from the living room, standing behind Nunally. Cold.

CRAWFORD
You know, I think I read somewhere that a good place to find a pulse is the femoral artery. It’s on the inner surface of the upper thigh. If you put your fingers - you know, right up inside her dress -
 
14


Nunally turns and lunges up, smashing a fist into Crawford’s face. Crawford reels backward with Nunally -

-	the two of them falling with Nunally on top, beating Crawford furiously, cursing -

-	as SWAT COPS burst in, grabbing Nunally, dragging him back - knocking into PARAMEDICS trying to get to Jennifer -

-	Nunally kicking, flailing, spitting at Crawford - who’s put face-down on the floor, to get cuffed.

Nunally pulls free from the SWAT cops, distraught, angry - going to retrieve his gun and shove it in his shoulder-holster, struggling to regain control.

PARAMEDIC
Wait a second - she’s not dead!

Nunally whirls - everyone freezing, breathless, falling silent.

The Paramedics kneeling around Jennifer work -

-	as Crawford lies on the floor, staring at his wife. Like she’s a machine that defied astronomical odds and refused to behave according to his calculations.


EXT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - SOON AFTER

Jennifer’s stretcher is loaded into an ambulance, doors slamming shut and sirens kicking on -

-	as Crawford, cuffed behind his back, is pushed into the back seat of a police car. His eyes on the ambulance as it pulls away, carrying his wife.


INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - SOON AFTER

A DETECTIVE uses a pencil to lift Crawford’s gun from the coffee table and carefully put it in an evidence bag.

Nunally stands back, watching the COPS and TECHNICIANS work the scene - lost in his thoughts, shaken.

SWAT COMMANDER
You all right?

Nunally "wakes" - nods.	Absently:
 
15


NUNALLY
Yeah.	I’m good.

To avoid talking more, he heads out to the glaring lights and chaos outside.

FADE OUT


INT. WILLY’S APARTMENT - THE NEXT MORNING

The alarm clock shifts to 6:00 am and pops on to local news and traffic -

- but the narrow futon bed is already empty.

WILLY SLOCUM works at a laptop on his second-hand desk, lit by a solitary lamp.

He is in his late-20s, good-looking. Short hair, office-pale but athletic, wearing mis-matched sweats from Eastern Oklahoma State College.

He jots a final note, sets his yellow legal pad aside. As he goes to the closet-sized bathroom, pulling off his sweatshirt and starting the tiny pre-fab shower, we linger on the laptop screen: rental listings for a new apartment.

TIME CUT

The bare overhead bulb is on, revealing the concrete floor and painted-plywood walls. His clothes hang neatly on a length of pipe suspended by ropes from the exposed rafters. Law school texts fill cinderblock-and-board shelves.

The radio chatters. Willy knots a tie in his crisp white collar.

TIME CUT

Willy methodically packs legal folders from last night’s "homework" into his big, battered briefcase. He has to work to stuff all the files in.

He pulls on his suit jacket, settles the shoulders, tugs at his cuffs. Uncaps a pen, leans over a one-sentence letter waiting on the desk. Reads it over.

As he signs, we glimpse:

-	hereby give notice that I will be resigning my position at the District Attorney’s Office as of Novemb-
 
16


Willy savors the moment.

Then he tucks the letter into an envelope, gets the heavy briefcase - goes to shut off the light and open the door -

-	which swings about six inches, then clonks into something. Willy grimaces. Peeks out, goes to pound on a wall.
WILLY
Mrs. Demello?
(Beat)
MRS. DEMELLO!	Your CAR!

Silence. He sighs. Shuts the door and presses a button near the light-switch.

There’s mechanical grinding noise as the far wall slowly rolls up, letting in daylight and revealing an alley beyond the hanging clothes and cinderblock shelves.

He presses the garage-door-opener button again, and hurries across the apartment to duck out under the closing door.


EXT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

Willy straightens and takes a breath, re-settling his suit jacket with an irritable glance at his landlady’s car, parked sloppily next to the garage, blocking his door.

As he walks away, down the alley, we rise up to reveal the hazy sprawling landscape of L.A. - and the towers of Downtown, rising ahead of Willy like Oz.

WILLY (V.O.)
Come on, Phil: I called you as a courtesy, and you start looking to take advantage?


INT. WILLY’S OFFICE - LATER THAT MORNING

An ancient fluorescent-lit cubby crammed with documents, case files, notes, reference books. Willy on the phone:

WILLY
I’m not knocking it down to a Class C.
My backlog of open cases does not
mitigate the fact that your client
tried to kill his brother-in-law with -
oh, right, a "golfing accident"?	Your
client owns one golf club and no golf
(MORE)
 
17


WILLY (cont’d)
balls - and the "accident" took place
in the stairway of an illegal after-
hours gambling club.	Yeah, okay -
I’ll see you in court.

His cell phone rings.	As he gets it:

WILLY
Well, I won’t see you in court, but someone from this office will. You take it up with them, I gotta go.
(switching phones)
Willy Slocum.	Oh - hey, hi, yes.

Assistant District Attorney NORMAN CHANG (mid-30s) throws the door open without looking:

NORMAN
Wooton Sims?!

Willy holds up a finger, talking into his cell:

WILLY
No, I didn’t.	Wow.	Okay.

Norman mouths "WOOTON SIMS?!" repeatedly during:

WILLY
No - short notice is...fine. No, I can. Black tie. Sure. What time? Okay. Yes. Thank her.

He hangs up, exhales slowly.	Looks at Norman.

NORMAN
Wooton Sims?!	Wooton - SIMS?!

WILLY
Please stop saying, "Wooton Sims" over and over. It’s starting to sound like nonsense words.

NORMAN
You asshole!

WILLY
Okay: go back to "Wooton Sims."

As Willy gets up and goes out, past Norman -

NORMAN
How the hell did you get a job at Wooton Sims?! I can’t even get an interview!
 
18


INT. DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE - DAY

Norman follows Willy out to a central bullpen area where the shared ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANTS work: MONA and GLADYS.

NORMAN
I’ve been here five years. I’m your supervisor. I graduated USC, summa!

WILLY
We’re just going to pretend he’s not talking, okay?
 

MONA
No problem.
 


NORMAN
I’m serious.

 
WILLY
I’m really jammed-up all day, and I need to rent a tuxedo - for tonight.

NORMAN
A tuxedo?! Oh, come on! You are so full of shit.

WILLY
(Jotting notes)

There must be a place that does that, right - same day? I’m also gonna need a messenger to bring it here. This is my suit size and my shirt size...I really appreciate this.

Mona nods, taking notes as Willy gets out a credit card.
Other DDAs are gathering to soak up some vicarious kicks.

MONA
What’s going on?

WILLY
Wooton Sims buys a whole lot of seats to this charity opera thing every year, because Bob Wooton is the chairman of this committee -

NORMAN
"Bob" Wooton?!

WILLY
(Enjoying, mock-helpless)
It’s what the man told me to call him.
 
19


GLADYS
You’re gonna need to pick out a style,
Willy.

WILLY
A style.

GLADYS
For the tuxedo.

Willy hesitates, in over his head. A DDA helpfully does the Travolta finger-in-the-air pose.

WILLY
I don’t know - I just don’t want to look like I’m going to the prom.

GLADYS
You wanna go Classic.	Fix him up.

MONA
We’ll get you something Classic. (Picks up a ringing phone)
Willy Slocum’s office.

NORMAN
Make sure it comes with cuff-links and knee-pads.

WILLY
Oh, that’s very nice: it’s good to be back in high school.

MONA
(Hanging up)
Willy?

Her tone makes him - and everyone else - turn.

MONA
God wants to see you.

WILLY
(Beat)
Our God?

MONA
Who art on the Eleventh Floor.

Willy, startled, looks around. Approving nods, raised eyebrows. He tightens his tie and heads for the elevators.
 
20


NORMAN
There is no justice! There is no justice in the city of Los Angeles!


INT. LOBRUTO’S OFFICE - SOON AFTER

District Attorney JOE LOBRUTO, 50-ish, sits behind a massive oak desk, studying a thick file. Doesn’t look up as a SECRETARY shows Willy in.

Willy hesitates. Looks around: he’s never been here. Flags, wood panelling, leather furniture, windows overlooking the city. Finally Lobruto looks up, takes Willy in.

LOBRUTO
William No-Middle-Initial Slocum.

WILLY
Yes sir.

LOBRUTO
Sit.
(As Willy does:)
Eighty-four-percent conviction rate.
That’s remarkable.

WILLY
Thank you.

LOBRUTO
With a case load thirty percent higher than any other first-year DDA.
(Beat)
Of course - you also swapped more cases than the rest of them put together.

Willy considers his options.	He always does.

WILLY
I offered my losing cases in exchange for two or three of anyone else’s possible convictions. They couldn’t handle their workloads, and I prefer not to lose.

Lobruto knew this; the question was would Willy admit it.

LOBRUTO
You’re going to need a middle initial.
 
21


WILLY
Sir?

LOBRUTO
You’re going to Wooton Sims.

WILLY
In two weeks.

LOBRUTO
You’ll be able to afford a better suit. But those guys all play squash and have middle names. They go in for the mother’s maiden name a lot.

Beat. Willy doesn’t like the implied personal judgement, but the only way it shows is how calm he stays.

WILLY
My mother didn’t have a maiden name.

Lobruto nods, unruffled by Willy’s hard calm.

LOBRUTO
So you’re a bastard; sometimes I can be a son-of-a-bitch. Maybe you belong here.

WILLY
I didn’t work this hard to stay where
I belong.

LOBRUTO
You’re a street-fighter, Willy. You should be in court. We can move you up to better cases.

WILLY
I appreciate the offer.

LOBRUTO
I didn’t think so.

(Closes the file, stands) Well - you got your litigation experience. Your chops. And your juicy private sector job. Anything else the City of Los Angeles can do for you?

Willy’s amused.	He stands, too.	As they shake hands:
 
22


WILLY
No, I think that’s everything - thank you.

LOBRUTO
The offer stands. If you get tired of carrying a spear.

Willy nods - but Lobruto notes the tiny flicker in his eyes:
not getting it and trying to cover.	Lobruto smiles gently.

LOBRUTO
It’s an opera joke. Give my regards to Bob.


INT. WILLY’S OFFICE - LATER

Willy’s twisting in his rented tux, trying to adjust a buckle on the side of the vest.

The phone rings and he gives up, frustrated - pushing the plastic garment-bag aside to answer -

-	knocking a full cup of take-out coffee on to his chair. Which is where he left his suit.

Willy freezes.	Watching the coffee seep into the fabric.
Into the phone, distracted:

WILLY
Willy Slocum.

INTERCUT WITH:


INT. NORMAN’S OFFICE - THE SAME TIME

Norman’s looking at a case file.

NORMAN
I’ve got an Attempted Homicide. Conley caught it last night, but he’s hung up in motions with Gardner. Arraignment in Part Seven, at three o’clock.

WILLY
Three o’clock is in fifteen minutes.

NORMAN
Thank you.	What’s the temperature?
 
23


WILLY
I can’t do it.

NORMAN
You do still actually work here, Willy, right? I mean, you’re still going to be cashing your paycheck for another two weeks and everything?

WILLY
Just get somebody else for this one.

NORMAN
Everybody’s booked up. Look: it’s not going to trial. There’s a weapon with prints, and a confession. Take the arraignment and wait for the plea.

WILLY
(Beat)
A real confession?

NORMAN
Spontaneous and signed.	Come on,
Willy.

Willy sighs.	Looking down at his coffee-soaked suit.

WILLY
Okay.	Here’s the problem.


INT. NORMAN’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Norman slowly smiles, listening.

NORMAN
You know - I really wish I was going to see this.


INT. COURTROOM - LATER

Willy slips self-consciously through the double-doors, wearing the tuxedo.

He gets even more self-conscious when he notices a handful of local REPORTERS. He hurries in -

-	passing Nunally, in the back row. Nunally is making a good show of keeping it together...but it’s only a show.

JUDGE IRENE FELDMAN, 50-ish, looks over her half-glasses.
 
24


JUDGE FELDMAN
Mr. Slocum. Nice to see a man who dresses for court.

WILLY
Sorry, your honor.	Long story.

Willy, hurrying to Prosecution Table, barely glances at the Defense Table -

-	but Crawford, sitting beside his PUBLIC DEFENDER in an orange jumpsuit and handcuffs, never takes his eyes off Willy, intrigued.

JUDGE FELDMAN
Grapevine has it the punch-line is
Wooton Sims.

WILLY
Yes, ma’am.

JUDGE FELDMAN
Good for you, double-oh-seven.

(Signaling the Bailiff) Let’s see what public service is offering you by way of a send-off:

BAILIFF
The State of California Versus Thomas
Crawford.

The Defense rises; Crawford hardly pays any attention to the Judge - glancing back and noticing Nunally, whose eyes bore into him, haunted and burning.

Crawford stares at him impassively a second, then turns to lean past his P.D. and watch Willy hastily skim the file.

JUDGE
Mr. Crawford, you’ve been charged with section 664 slash 187 of the California Penal Code: Attempted Murder, with additional allegations of Assault With a Deadly Weapon - Penal Code section 245 dash A2, with Great Bodily Injury, P.C. Section 12022.07.
(Beat)

Do you waive further reading of the complaint and complete statement of rights?
 
25
 


P.D.
(sotto)
 




I do.
 



CRAWFORD
But, your honor -

 
You do.

JUDGE FELDMAN
And do you wish to enter a plea at this time?

CRAWFORD
Not guilty. But I also want to waive my right to counsel, and represent myself.

Willy looks up from the file - startled.

JUDGE FELDMAN
Do you have a problem with your
appointed counsel, Mr. Crawford?

CRAWFORD
No. I just want to do it myself. I believe it’s within my rights.

P.D.
Your honor, if I could have a moment with my client -

CRAWFORD
I’m not your client. Try and keep up, would you?

The P.D. shuts up, taken aback. The Judge considers Crawford, thoughtful, then turns to Willy.

JUDGE FELDMAN
Do the People have an objection or a comment for the record, Mr. Slocum?

Willy hesitates, held by Crawford’s strange, amused gaze.
Shakes it off:

WILLY
I’m sorry, your honor: we’ve got the weapon and a signed confession. I really think Mr. Crawford needs a competent attorney to - frankly - negotiate a plea.

Crawford reaches up with cuffed hands and adjusts an imaginary bow-tie. Willy self-consciously touches where Crawford indicated on his own collar, straightens his clip-on.
 
26


Crawford nods: you’re welcome.	Willy turns to the Judge.

WILLY
I - can’t - this was supposed to be -
with a pro se defendant, this is going
to drag out for months - and I’m not
even going to be here.	The People
request a continuance to -

CRAWFORD
Excuse me? Your honor? I’m willing to waive my right to a preliminary hearing and go directly to a jury trial.
(To Willy)
Does that help?

JUDGE
You don’t need to look out for Mr. Slocum, Mr. Crawford. The District Attorney’s office can shift another prosecutor to the case -

CRAWFORD
No, I like Mr. Slocum.

Beat.

JUDGE FELDMAN
Mr. Slocum?	He likes you.

WILLY
Terrific.

JUDGE FELDMAN
Mr. Crawford seems to understand his rights and responsibilities.

WILLY
All due respect, your honor, I’m worried this may turn into some sort of a - circus -

JUDGE FELDMAN
I appreciate your concern for the
dignity of my courtroom, Mr. Slocum -
considering you’re making the argument
dressed as a game-show host.
Unfortunately, the man is a tax-paying
citizen, entitled by our Constitution
to try and manipulate the legal
system, like everybody else.

 	JUDGE FELDMAN (cont’d)
As for you, Mr. Crawford, I strongly
urge you to retain counsel.	Lack of
same will not be grounds for appeal.

CRAWFORD
I understand.	Thank you.

JUDGE FELDMAN
Are the People ready to go to trial without a preliminary hearing?

Willy hesitates, irritated.	Looks through the file again.
Checks Crawford - waiting, polite.

WILLY
Sure.	Why not.

Crawford smiles at him, as the Judge opens her calendar.


INT. PARKING STRUCTURE - LATER

Willy, in his tux, comes out of a staircase and stops. Rob Nunally is waiting by Willy’s parked car.

NUNALLY
You’re supposed to be good.

Willy takes him in - wary, seeing an edge of anger and fear beneath the tough controlled cop manner.

WILLY
Is that what I’m supposed to be?

NUNALLY
I asked around. You’re supposed to be top-notch - but to me it looks like you’ve got one foot out the door, and you’re wiping the rest of us off the bottom of the other one.

WILLY
I’m sorry to...disappoint you.

Nunally is silent - frustrated. The concrete walls and ceilings echo from distant cars.

NUNALLY
I took Crawford’s confession.

WILLY
And now you want mine?
 
28


NUNALLY
I’m here to warn you. Take this seriously, because it’s serious. This guy is stone cold - and his wife - is lying in a hospital bed - with brain damage...

He struggles to keep himself under control.

WILLY
Are you all right?

NUNALLY
Are you gonna be on this, or what?

WILLY
Yeah.	I’m on it.
(Gently)

You got a confession. You took the gun out of his hand. It’s done.

NUNALLY
I’m just - telling you.	Is that okay?
Or are you too friggin’ busy?!

WILLY
No.	It’s okay.

Willy waits.	Watching the tortured cop wrestle with demons.

NUNALLY
Forget it.
(Beat)

It’s a lock. We’re good. Put him down. Bury him.

Willy nods.	Nunally turns and walks away, down a ramp.

Willy watches him go. Sad. Like he’s watching Nunally drown. But he’s seen people drown before...and he’s not about to put out a hand. Might get pulled in himself.


INT. CHANDLER PAVILION - LOBBY - LATER

Willy moves uneasily among clusters of laughing, chatting, sparkling FORMAL-DRESSED PEOPLE.

NIKKI GARDNER joins him, strolling alongside. She’s his age, but her elegant dress, unlike his tux, was made for her.

NIKKI
Are you a shark?
 
29


WILLY
Sorry?

NIKKI
You’ve been circling the lobby for half-an-hour now, like if you stopped you’d die.

WILLY
If I stopped, I’d be standing around with no one to talk to. At which point, death would be a relief.

NIKKI
Why don’t you talk to Bob?

Willy stops walking, getting a little careful.

WILLY
"Bob" is talking to the Governor.
(Beat)
Do I know you?

She puts a hand out, gently amused.

NIKKI
Nikki Gardner.	Senior Associate,
Wooton Sims.

WILLY
(Shakes)
Oh - hey, hi.	It was your office that
called, with the invitation.

NIKKI
On Bob’s orders.

WILLY
Listen, I don’t...actually know "Bob."
I mean, I’ve only met the man once.

Nikki nods, considering this.	And him.

NIKKI
Interesting.

They’re each conscious of an unexpected buzz of attraction. The lobby lights flicker, breaking the spell a little. As the CROWD begins to drift toward the auditorium doors:

NIKKI
You like opera?
 
30


WILLY
Truth is, I haven’t really had that much expos-

NIKKI
Neither do I.

With a conspiratorial head-tip, Nikki moves toward the plaza doors. Willy follows.


EXT. ARTS CENTER - SOON AFTER

They stroll the emptying plaza, dressed to the nines.

NIKKI
Bob assigned you to my team. I’ll supervise your case-work, steer you through the office arcana, and generally keep an eye on you.

WILLY
Kind of like a mentor.

NIKKI
Kind of like a probation officer.

Beat. Willy nods, meeting Nikki’s gaze as she looks to make sure he’s got it.

WILLY
Okay.

NIKKI
Wooton Sims expects absolute loyalty and a hundred-and-ten-percent performance. But: you get to work on legendary litigation. National, sometimes global, in scope. It’s high-stakes. And cut-throat - even within the team. We burn out associates at an astonishing rate.

WILLY
You’re trying to scare me.

NIKKI
Yes.

WILLY
You’re going to have to try harder.

She stops walking.	Studying Willy.
 
31


NIKKI
Can I ask you something personal?

WILLY
Sure.

NIKKI
Who are you?

Willy doesn’t answer. Maybe uncertain what she means. Maybe not wanting her to know. Or even not knowing, himself.

NIKKI
We have a guy in our criminal division, fresh out of Yale, named Calvin Tyler. One of our very rich clients gets pulled over, D.U.I. - which is routine bullshit, so Calvin gets it. Against you. Next thing we know, Calvin is fired, and Bob Wooton, who has never even interviewed a junior associate before - let alone hired one - says you’re on my team.

Willy weighs his options.	Decides to level:

WILLY
It was a good bust, so Calvin came to me for a deal. I told him if he could arrange an interview for me with Mr. Wooton, I would throw the case. I laid out his arguments and evidence for him - and I showed him how I would lose. Calvin set up my appointment for the day after our court date. Then he did what I had suggested in court - and I wiped the floor with him. Your client got the maximum. Next day, I met with Mr. Wooton.
(Shrugs)
Bob.

Beat.

NIKKI
Wow. You know what’s brilliant about that?

WILLY
Yes.
 
32


NIKKI
You didn’t actually do anything all that wrong.

WILLY
Well - I wasn’t entirely honest with
Calvin.

His cell-phone rings.	He ignores it.

NIKKI
You gonna get that?

WILLY
Everyone I need to talk to is here.

They are both feeling the electricity in the air between them. They wait the phone out, enjoying the forbidden insanity of it. But then:

NIKKI
We need to talk about your transition timetable.

WILLY
All right.

NIKKI
Bob believes in trial-by-fire. He wants you up-to-speed two weeks from Tuesday, because we’re getting on a plane to Chicago for depositions in a class-action against our biggest client, Armstead Pharmaceutical.

WILLY
No problem.

She studies Willy, trying to make sure he understands:

NIKKI
That’s catch-up on three years’ work - and you haven’t closed out your old job yet.

WILLY
I’m good at trials.	Even by fire.

Beat.

NIKKI
You know, a little bit of fear can be a very healthy thing to have.
 
33


WILLY
I’m looking forward to when I can afford the luxury of having some.

Nikki sighs, smiles.	Enjoying him, somewhat reluctantly.

NIKKI
I’ll have them put the Armstead
materials in your new office.

WILLY
Thanks.	Boss.

He watches her head off into the night. He remains, alone, in his tuxedo, looking at the elegant glittering arts plaza.

Then he checks his cell-phone.	Dials.

INTERCUT WITH:


INT. FORENSICS LAB - LATER

MARCHAND, Senior S.I.D. (Scene Investigation Division) Tech, works as he talks into a speaker-phone. He and Willy have teamed-up often, and an underlying respect lets them mock each other.

MARCHAND
Marchand.

WILLY
It’s Willy Slocum.	What’s up?

MARCHAND
Your gun in that Palisades shooting is no good.

WILLY
How can the gun be "no good"?

MARCHAND
It’s a perfectly good weapon. A Heckler & Koch nine-millimeter. It’s just no good as evidence. It’s never been fired.

WILLY
It’s the gun from the scene?
 
34


MARCHAND
Yep. Bought by Mr. Thomas Crawford and registered to his wife, about a month ago. Apparently a gift.

WILLY
And between the shooting and arrest, this guy was locked inside his house.

MARCHAND
Is that a question?

WILLY
No, I mean, just: what’s the point? Playing games with the gun. He’s alone in the house with the victim, and he confessed - it’s not like the gun’s gonna get him off the hook.

MARCHAND
Do you have a question I can answer?

Beat.	Willy shakes the puzzle off, irritated:

WILLY
Look, our weapon is in that house somewhere. Get a team out to search it tomorrow morning.

MARCHAND
Ya think?

WILLY
(Sighs, smiles)
Thank you.

He shuts the phone. Takes a moment, looking around again at where he is. Absently tugs at his tie and vest, lets the case go. Heads in to the opera.
