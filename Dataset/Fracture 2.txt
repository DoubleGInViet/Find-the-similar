INT. WILLY’S OFFICE - A WEEK LATER

Controlled chaos. A week’s work has emptied the shelves and cleared the surfaces, but the file-cabinet drawers are all half-open: Willy sorts folders, neatly marking and packing them. White "trans-file" storage boxes are piled all over.

MESSENGER (O.S.)
Slocum?

Willy looks up, at a MESSENGER with another file box.
 
35


WILLY
Yeah.

MESSENGER
Where do you want it?

WILLY
The idea here is we’re trying to take boxes out - not bring more in.

MESSENGER
Is that the idea?

Willy sourly gestures to a chair; checks the label as the Messenger sets it down -

WILLY
Whoa - wait a second, this is a screw-
up.	I already have these documents.
I sent this box: to the Defendant, at
County.

MESSENGER
I picked up at County. Slip says bring ’em here.

Messenger holds out a clipboard. Willy reluctantly signs. As the Messenger leaves, Willy cuts the tape and takes out a folder. Opens it:

Crawford has scrawled NO in red marker across the top sheet.

Willy turns to the next page.	A big red NO across that, too.

Pulls out more documents - flips through: NO - NO - NO - NO - red letters wriggling across the typed pages, like flip-book animation.

Beat.	Disturbed, he picks up the phone, dials.

INTERCUT WITH:


INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - THE SAME TIME

S.I.D. TECHS are taking the place apart: opening HVAC vents, pulling books off shelves, upending chairs and tables, removing drawers from cabinets.

Marchand, supervising, answers his cell-phone:

MARCHAND
Marchand.
 
36


WILLY
Where are we on this gun?

MARCHAND
We can’t find it, Willy.

WILLY
I’m in trial on Monday.

MARCHAND
I know. I don’t know what to tell you. I’m there now.

WILLY
You said you’d get a team out a week ago -

MARCHAND
I’m here now. My team has been here twice already.
(Beat)
Do you really need it?

WILLY
Do I need it?!	The weapon?!

He takes a second.	Sighs, exasperated - but honest:

WILLY
I don’t know.	Probably not.
Defendant’s a whack-job.

MARCHAND
He went pro se, right?

WILLY
Yeah. Just when you think they’re not really stupid, they defend themselves.

MARCHAND
You’ve got a confession and an airtight bunch of circumstantial.
(Apologetic)
We’ve gone over this place top-to-bottom three times now, Willy.

Willy takes a breath.	Thinks it through.

WILLY
Yeah, okay.	Don’t worry about it.
(Beat)
Sorry - got a lot going on.
 
37


MARCHAND
Must be rough, figuring out what you’re gonna do with all that money.

WILLY
Hey, I had to sit through an opera last week.

MARCHAND
Oh gee - lemme see if I can express how much sympathy I have:

Marchand snaps his phone shut.

Willy smiles, hangs up. But then his smile fades, as he glances down again at Crawford’s box of papers.

Hundreds of pages.	Every single one scrawled NO.

Willy considers them.


INT. COUNTY JAIL - INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER

Metal chairs. Bad light. Crawford sits, cuffed, at a table, waiting. Looks up as the door unlocks.

A GUARD lets Willy in, locks the door behind him.

Crawford watches Willy take a legal pad, files, pens from his briefcase, set them on the table.

CRAWFORD
How’s my wife?

WILLY
I don’t know.

CRAWFORD
I heard somewhere, I think it was on N.P.R., that you’re supposed to talk to people in a coma. Play their favorite music. Supposedly it reaches them.

Willy, now ready, lets Crawford study him.

CRAWFORD
You represent Jennifer. The voice of the victim, judicially speaking. But you haven’t gone to see her?
 
38


WILLY
Not yet.

CRAWFORD
Too busy getting up to speed on
Armstead Pharmaceutical?

Beat.

WILLY
I beg your pardon?

CRAWFORD
I’m not judging you. I think anyone - coming from...what you came from - then paying your way through East-Okie Cowshit College and Tulsa Law by writing papers for Princeton kids on the internet - my God, it must have eaten your liver! Sixty-thousand dollars in debt, eighty-four percent conviction rate: you deserve this.

Willy tries to stay in control.

WILLY
What the hell have you been doing.

CRAWFORD
I’m permitted the use of a private investigator.

WILLY
Not to investigate me!

CRAWFORD
Why not?	You’re investigating me.

WILLY
You shot your wife.

CRAWFORD
Allegedly.	That’s how it works,
right?	If I can’t introduce something
in court as evidence - it doesn’t
exist.	Legally.

WILLY
Look - I don’t want to play games with
you.

CRAWFORD
I’m afraid you have to.
 
39


Beat. Willy reconstructs his formal cool. Takes some pages scrawled NO from a folder, pushes them across the table.

WILLY
Is this some form of - communication?

CRAWFORD
You sent me a box of papers.

WILLY
It’s called Discovery. The State has a legal obliga-

CRAWFORD
There’s nothing in it, Willy. You haven’t ’discovered’ anything. Have you found the gun?

Beat.

WILLY
Not yet.

CRAWFORD
No.
(Beat)

Does it bother you that I call you Willy?

WILLY
(Lies)
No.

Crawford nods.	Pleased.	Leans forward.

CRAWFORD
I’d like you to consider becoming my lawyer. I’ll pay you. A lot of money.

WILLY
I’m - prosecuting you.

CRAWFORD
Yeah, but I’m offering you a chance to get on the right side of this whole mess while you still can.

WILLY
Are you out of your mind?
 
40


CRAWFORD
I think - on advice of counsel - I’ll decline to answer that one.

Willy studies him. Decides: it’s an elaborate act. Begins to put away his papers.

WILLY
I don’t need the gun to convict you, by the way.

CRAWFORD
She was cheating, you know.

Willy looks at him, slightly taken aback. He didn’t know; it wasn’t in the confession.

As he considers whether it makes a difference - he notices Crawford watching, enjoying. Willy shuts his briefcase.

WILLY
It doesn’t matter what she did...Tom.
What you did is a crime.

CRAWFORD
Perhaps. But - maybe my so-called peers will look at me and see themselves. Betrayed. Frustrated. Humiliated. And you and I both know, Willy, that people have an infinite capacity for believing in their own innocence.

WILLY
Great. Take the stand. Tell your story. I’d appreciate it.

CRAWFORD
Not to mention the fact you have no actual evidence connecting me to the crime.

Willy smiles, gets up.

WILLY
Except your confession.

Crawford watches him go to the door.

CRAWFORD
My grandfather was an egg farmer.

Willy stops, annoyed.
 
41


WILLY
Is this gonna be about how you had a rough childhood?

CRAWFORD
I used to candle eggs at his farm. You know what that is? You hold an egg up to a light, and look for imperfections.
(beat)
The first time I did it, he told me to put the ones that were cracked or flawed in a bucket - for the bakery.
(beat)

He came back an hour later and there were three hundred eggs in the bakery bucket. He asked me what the hell I was doing.
(beat)
I found a flaw in every single one. Thin places in the shell, minuscule cracks.
(smiles)

Look closely enough and you’ll find everything has a weak spot...where it can break.

WILLY
Looking for mine?

CRAWFORD
No, I’ve found yours.

WILLY
Illuminate me.

Crawford considers how to put it.

CRAWFORD
You’re a winner, Willy.

Silence.	Willy pushes the call-button by the door.

WILLY
Huh. Well. Joke’s on me then, I guess.

CRAWFORD
Yes.	It is.

WILLY
I’ll see you in court, Mr. Crawford.
 
42


The door unlocks.	Crawford winks.

Willy hesitates for a second - then leaves.


INT. WOOTON, SIMS - EMPTY OFFICE - LATER

It’s big. It’s got a window. It’s got a sofa. Undecorated, except for a pile of materials & boxes marked ARMSTEAD PHARMACEUTICAL.

Willy is filling out forms - tax, citizenship, benefits. He doesn’t notice Nikki when she comes to the door.

NIKKI
Make sure you sign the one with the devil in blood. It’s not binding otherwise.

He looks up, smiles.

WILLY
Just want to be ready for Chicago. I’m all closed-out, downtown. Last trial starts Monday.

Beat.	Not pleased:

NIKKI
You’ve got a trial Monday?

WILLY
Yeah: attempted murder.

NIKKI
That gives you three days. You told me - and I told Bob - that you would be ready to hit the ground r-

WILLY
The man confessed.	And he’s pro se.

NIKKI
Willy, some but acting as his own lawyer - he could drag it out for months!

WILLY
You want to hear his witness list?

Nikki nods.	Willy is silent.	She frowns.
 
43


NIKKI
No witnesses?

Willy leans in, enjoying this part - analyzing, even admiring, Crawford’s ploy:

WILLY
It’s kind of clever: this guy is trying to provoke the system into declaring him insane. I think he thinks we’ll call in the doctors and he can fake ’em out by refusing the defense. He’s acting out this really - organized plan to appear crazy.

Beat.	Nikki considers Willy.

NIKKI
You’re gonna miss being in court, aren’t you?

He studies her, confident.	Gestures to the stacks of
Armstead materials:

WILLY
I’m almost halfway through these. And I think I’ve already found about six disqualifiers in Delaware, Ohio, and Florida. I have to check case law in each state, but it looks good. I’ll get the rest done over the long weekend.

Nikki sighs, smiles a little, against her will. He’s won her over...again.

Willy shrugs, grins. In the silence, the impossible electricity returns. After a moment - to defuse it:

NIKKI
You don’t go home for Thanksgiving?

Slight beat.

WILLY
No.

She studies him a moment, thoughtful.	Careful.

NIKKI
If you want - you’re welcome at mine.
My family’s.
 
44


WILLY
Really?

She nods. Smiling a little, knowing her family and starting to know Willy:

NIKKI
I think it would be interesting.

Beat.

WILLY
Yeah.	Okay, thank you.

NIKKI
Cool.

Beat.	She leaves.	Willy doesn’t go back to work right away.


INT. COURTROOM - THE NEXT DAY

JUDGE ROBINSON presiding. A mid-sized crowd, including a few REPORTERS. A UNIFORM COP is in the witness box, Willy stands in the Prosecution Table.

UNIFORM COP
We established a perimeter around the house and then waited for SWAT and the Negotiator. It was strictly by the book.

WILLY
So the house was completely surrounded within how long of the first shots?

Crawford sits alone at the Defense Table. He wears an expensive suit and no handcuffs, but two DEPUTIES sit behind him. He’s barely listening to the testimony - drawing on his legal pad: intricate, dense complex diagrams of "Rube Goldberg" contraptions.

UNIFORM COP
Maybe ten minutes.

WILLY
And when you arrived at the sc-

Crawford noisily tears a page off his pad. Looks up - sees Willy, and everyone else, turned to him.

CRAWFORD
Sorry.
 
45


Willy sighs, returns to the Cop.

WILLY
When you arrived on the scene, was there a crowd?

UNIFORM COP
Oh yeah. Neighbors, came out to look soon as it started.

WILLY
And from what you could ascertain, no one went into or came out of the house until SWAT and the negotiator arrived?

UNIFORM COP
Definitely not.

WILLY
Thank you.	No further questions.

JUDGE ROBINSON
Mr. Crawford?

Crawford looks up from his drawing.

CRAWFORD
What?

JUDGE ROBINSON
Your witness, Mr. Crawford.

Crawford takes in the Uniform Cop.

CRAWFORD
No questions for this witness.

Willy watches Crawford return diligently to his doodles.

DISSOLVE TO:


CLOSE-UP: THE DEFENSE TABLE - LATER THAT AFTERNOON

It’s a mess of loose legal-pad pages torn from Crawford’s pad, each covered in madly intricate schematics. He works on yet another, head down, intent.

Dr. MARION KANG is on the stand, using a marker on a big diagram of a head:
 
46


DR. KANG
-	through the frontal cortex and the temporal lobe, coming to rest against the back of the skull.

WILLY
So this bullet inflicted serious
injury?

DR. KANG
It inflicted serious and irreparable injury.

Willy nods, allowing the jury time on this. He checks a note-card, glances at Crawford. Considers his options.

WILLY
Dr. Kang, is it safe to say that someone inflicting this kind of wound intended to kill?

Judge Robinson gives Willy a warning look.

JUDGE ROBINSON
Mr. Crawford, you might want to object. The witness can’t know your state of mind.

Crawford doesn’t even look up from his drawing.

CRAWFORD
No thank you, your honor.

Willy gives Judge Robinson an I-told-you-so shrug. Turns to Dr. Kang.

KANG
I would say so, yes.

WILLY
Thank you, Dr. Kang.

Crawford tears off the page, starts another.


INT. COURTROOM - LATER

Nunally on the stand. Focused, professional. Crawford draws, ignoring him.

WILLY
So after you put down your gun, what did Mr. Crawford do?
 
47


NUNALLY
He confessed to shooting his wife.

WILLY
He confessed.
(Beat)

Did Mr. Crawford appear confused or in any way intoxicated, impaired?

NUNALLY
No. Not at all. He knew what was going on.

WILLY
What did Mr. Crawford say?

Nunally looks at Crawford, enjoying the fatal blow:

NUNALLY
He said, "I got the gun and I shot my wife. God help me, I shot her in the head. I know it was wrong."

CRAWFORD
(low, still drawing)
Objection.

Everyone turns, surprised.

JUDGE ROBINSON
I’m sorry - Mr. Crawford, did you say something?

Crawford sets aside his pen for the first time.	Looks up.

CRAWFORD
Yes.	I want to object.

JUDGE ROBINSON
On what grounds?

CRAWFORD
I don’t know.

WILLY
Your honor -

CRAWFORD
I don’t know what you’d call it.	They
- it wasn’t the first time, either,
but - I don’t know the legal term.
 
48


JUDGE ROBINSON
Why don’t you just explain it in
layman’s terms.

CRAWFORD
Fucking the victim.

Uproar in the court.

JUDGE ROBINSON
Mr. Crawford -

CRAWFORD
You said layman’s terms -

WILLY
Your honor -

CRAWFORD
I’m sorry - what would you call it - legally - when the officer who arrested you has been having sexual intercourse with your wife?

Utter silence. Willy whirls a look at Nunally. The cop meets his eyes - a deer in headlights.

WILLY
(Low)
Oh - shit.

CRAWFORD
I think it’s objectionable - maybe I’m wrong.

WILLY
Your honor...

JUDGE ROBINSON
Detective Nunally?

Nunally looks down, silent.	Shaking his head.

CRAWFORD
Rob?

WILLY
Your honor, the People request a -

Nunally suddenly launches himself over the witness box rail
to attack Crawford - as the Deputies leap forward to stop him - all of them flailing and cursing in a tangle -
 
49


- spectators screaming, fleeing, gawking.	Chaos.


INT. JUDGE ROBINSON’S CHAMBERS - SOON AFTER

The Judge grim, Willy panicked, Crawford calm.

WILLY
He had my witness list. He should have filed to suppress.

CRAWFORD
(Shrugs)
My mistake.	Sorry.

JUDGE ROBINSON
Mr. Crawford, I warned you about
representing yourself.

CRAWFORD
What about the fact that it’s true? I mean, isn’t that the point here: to get to the truth?

JUDGE ROBINSON
Mr. Slocum - is it true?

WILLY
I don’t know. I only heard about it five minutes ago.

CRAWFORD
Put him back on the witness stand if you don’t believe me.

WILLY
We can’t put him back on now! Not after what the jury just saw. Your honor, I told you this would turn into a circus. First he provokes the witness with an outrageous allegation -

CRAWFORD
My Dick has evidence.

The Judge and Willy look at Crawford like he’s truly insane.

JUDGE ROBINSON
Excuse me?

CRAWFORD
My investigator.	I call him Dick.	I
guess I should call him as a rebuttal
(MORE)
 
50


CRAWFORD (cont’d) witness? He’s got phone records, credit receipts, photographs, videotapes - all documenting the affair. In graphic detail. (Beat. Mildly:) Dick is good.

The Judge looks at Willy.	This is bad.	Thinking fast:

WILLY
Okay - um: I’ll stipulate that my witness was less than forthcoming

...and that can more or less cancel out the fact that the defendant withheld a crucial -

JUDGE ROBINSON
Mr. Slocum - your witness was intimate with the victim, and he assaulted the defendant during the arrest.

CRAWFORD
Actually, while obtaining my so-called "confession."

Willy stares at Crawford, shaken.	Understanding the trap.

WILLY
No way.	Your honor -

JUDGE ROBINSON
He’s got a point. They were alone in the house. The confession is no good.

WILLY
Oh - come on!

CRAWFORD
Is this a legal argument? "Oh come on"?

WILLY
(Whirls on him)
You want to get into it?!

Crawford raises his eyebrows. Awkward silence. Willy takes a deep breath. Turns to the Judge.

WILLY
Sorry.
(Beat)

He dictated and signed his confession, after that incident.
 
51


JUDGE ROBINSON
In police custody. Arguably, in fear for his life. I’m sorry, Mr. Slocum - it’s all ’fruit of the tainted tree.’ We have to exclude all versions of the confession and any evidence collected by Lieutenant Nunally or by other police officers on the night he was present.

WILLY
This is insane!

CRAWFORD
It’s Biblical, isn’t it? The fruit and the tree and -

WILLY
He set this up! Don’t you see what he’s doing?!

JUDGE ROBINSON
Yes, I do. And I don’t like it. But it’s done, so we have to deal with it.

CRAWFORD
Do you think I could go home today, your honor? With Thanksgiving around the corner -

JUDGE ROBINSON
Don’t push it, Mr. Crawford.
(Beat)

What we’re going to do is give Mr. Slocum a few days to regroup and come up with new evidence. If he doesn’t - then you can go home. That’s going to put us into the long weekend. We reconvene Monday morning.

Willy just stands there: blind-sided, shell-shocked.
Crawford smiles at him.


INT. WILLY’S OFFICE - THAT EVENING

The end of a bad, bad day. Willy flips on the lights as he comes in, shaken.

A package is on the empty desk.	Addressed in red marker.
The return address: TC, County Jail.

Willy just stands looking at it.
 
52


INT. COUNTY JAIL - THE SAME TIME

Crawford sits on the metal bunk in his prison jumpsuit.
Alone.	Looking down.


INT. WILLY’S OFFICE - RESUME

As Willy takes a letter-opener from the desk drawer - the phone rings. He answers it, eyes still on the package:

WILLY
Willy Slocum.

INTERCUT WITH:


INT. GLAMOROUS BAR - THE SAME TIME

Crowded with UPSCALE YOUNG PROFESSIONALS. Nikki is on her cell-phone, hand over her other ear:

NIKKI
Well - you’ve gotta admire the
cleverness of it.

Willy begins cutting open the package as he talks:

WILLY
Do I?


INT. COUNTY JAIL - CONTINUOUS

Crawford very slowly raises his eyes, until he is looking directly at us.

NIKKI (V.O.)
Come on, Willy - give the devil his due.

WILLY (V.O.)
Yeah. I’m just trying to figure out what that is.


INT. WILLY’S OFFICE/GLAMOROUS BAR - RESUME

NIKKI
Okay: then listen - I checked with Bob
on how he wants you to handle this.
(MORE)
 
53


NIKKI (cont’d) Has LoBruto tried to take you off the case yet?

WILLY
No.

NIKKI
Well, he pretty much has to if he’s gonna save any face. So here’s the strategy: you let him.

Willy cautiously lifts the box’s flaps - pulls aside tissue paper - to reveal:

A single eggshell.	Broken, empty.

WILLY
I let him?


INT. COUNTY JAIL - CONTINUOUS

Crawford begins to smile.

NIKKI (V.O.)
Yeah, damage control. Stop getting your face on TV. As it is, I had to talk Bob down from cancelling your contract.


INT. WILLY’S OFFICE/GLAMOROUS BAR - RESUME

Willy is staring down at the broken eggshell, barely listening to Nikki.

NIKKI (CONT’D)
But we’ve got to move fast and get out from under. Otherwise, and I quote: "Stick a fork in this kid’s ass and turn him over, he’s done."

WILLY
I can’t just - walk away.

NIKKI
Willy: today, you got killed. The issue now is saving your new life.

Willy can’t take his eyes off Crawford’s "gift."

WILLY
I guess...that would be the smart way of looking at it.
 
54


INT. COUNTY JAIL - CONTINUOUS

Crawford stares right at us.	Smiling.	Ice cold.


INT. WILLY’S OFFICE/GLAMOROUS BAR - RESUME

Nikki is sympathetic, misunderstanding Willy’s quiet:

NIKKI
You want to come out and get drunk?

WILLY
No. Thank you. I’ve got some stuff to take care of.

NIKKI
All right.	Don’t beat yourself up.

WILLY
I won’t.

He hangs up. Considering the empty eggshell. But then he looks up:

District Attorney Lobruto is in his office doorway, trying to decide whether to be angry.

LOBRUTO
You don’t look into who the victim was sleeping with?

Willy burns, ashamed.	But unable to admit it.

WILLY
He - threw me off.
(Frustrated)

Look, Crawford knew he’d be the prime suspect, so he gave us everything - but he made it all radioactive. The night this went down, it was over.

LOBRUTO
But you still walked it into court, Willy. We might not have a case...but it didn’t have to be a public humiliation for this office and the police department.

Silence.
 
55


WILLY
Are you taking me off?

LOBRUTO
You’re leaving anyway.

WILLY
I’m starting to get a sense of this guy.

LOBRUTO
That’s not new evidence.

WILLY
I can take him now: he thinks he’s smarter than I am.

LOBRUTO
It’s not about you, Willy.

WILLY
Yeah, it is.	He made it that way.
(Shows him the egg)
He likes me.

LOBRUTO
What is that - some kind of Oklahoma insult?

WILLY
Let me do this. I won’t make you look bad.

Beat.

LOBRUTO
No. You won’t. That’s what I need to make sure you understand. I remove you now: I’m covered, I took some action.

(Beat)
If you go on with this, when you lose - blame has to come down. And it’ll come down on you. I’ll have to investigate you for improprieties, incompetence - anything I can. In public. I’ll hang you out to dry. For the good of this office.

Silence.

WILLY
If I lose.
 
56


LOBRUTO
What?

WILLY
You said "when."

Lobruto grimaces.	He shakes his head.	Sighs.

LOBRUTO
All right.	It’s yours.

Willy nods.	Stubborn.	Scared.


INT. MOTEL ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

Local news on the TV: Willy pushing past media outside the courthouse; official photo of Nunally; footage from the standoff at Crawford’s.

The sound is low, and Nunally isn’t watching. He’s sitting on the edge of the bed...looking down at his gun, in his hands.

A knock on the door "wakes" him. Beat. He sets the gun aside, goes to peek out the curtains. Lets Willy in.

WILLY
You’re not easy to find. I had to call Internal Affairs.

NUNALLY
Yeah - they put me on a desk - ’til
this gets...sorted out.

He uncomfortably watches Willy glance around at the half-empty liquor bottle, the mismatched suitcases and paper bags full of balled-up clothes. And the gun on the bed.

NUNALLY
Got home - my wife already took the kids to her folks. Press is all over our front lawn. Friggin’ vampires.

He falters, haunted by the echo.	Willy doesn’t notice:

WILLY
What the hell were you thinking. You’re on the job and you get called to your girlfriend’s house -
 
57


NUNALLY
I didn’t know it was her house. I’d never been there.

WILLY
It was her name!

NUNALLY
I didn’t know her name!

Willy waits.	Nunally explains, reluctant to expose himself:

NUNALLY
No last names. Her rules. We met at the same hotel room, twice a week - no phone calls, no questions. She didn’t want us to know too much about each other. She said it was like...travel in a foreign country. No baggage - from our lives. Just us. Escaping.

WILLY
Did you get the feeling she had rules because she had done it before? With other guys?

NUNALLY
No.	I don’t know.	Maybe.

(Thinking, remembering:) No. It was all just this...crazy thing. For both of us. It was...

real. You know? We didn’t expect that, when we started. We didn’t know where it was going. I had cheated so many times, I was numb - but she was

...new. And she made me feel like there was - some chance. To change. We were scared. It was like we were afraid to go forward, but we couldn’t go back.
(Beat)

You always think you have time. To work it out. Or make things right.
(Angry)
What was I supposed to do?!

WILLY
You were supposed to tell me!

NUNALLY
I’m married!	I have kids!
 
58


WILLY
You thought nobody knew - so maybe you could just walk away clean.

NUNALLY
No! I didn’t think HE knew! OKAY?! Even - after. I thought it was just - massively fouled-up...bad luck. Like - God - telling me - something.
(Anguished)
I’m there. My mind is going crazy. I know the confession won’t hold if anyone finds out.
(Beat)
I thought the guy was a whack!

WILLY
Yeah?	Well, he’s not.

Nunally won’t look at Willy.	He just sits there, numb.

WILLY
Is there anything else you can give me. Anything that might get us some evidence.

Nunally shakes his head.	Willy grimaces.	Goes to the door.

NUNALLY
I...tried to warn you.

Willy stops.	Looks back.

WILLY
You warned me he was smart.	You
didn’t warn me you were stupid.

Nunally winces. Takes it. Willy feels a little badly. Two guys in a shabby motel room, in terrible trouble.

NUNALLY
How do we get the confession back in?

WILLY
We don’t.

NUNALLY
What are you gonna do?

Willy shakes his head.	Walks out.
 
59


INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - THE NEXT DAY

A massive search is under way.

Marchand’s S.I.D. Team has been doubled, back-up by a dozen SHERIFF’S DEPUTIES -

- passing hand-held metal detectors along the furniture -

- taking pictures down from the walls -

-	turning over mattresses - patting-down every item hanging in the closets -

-	wriggling into crawlspaces - poking into light fixtures recessed into the ceilings -

-	opening the air-conditioning unit, up on the roof -

-	ripping out Crawford’s high-end home-theater system -

-	taking apart the Porsche in the garage.

Willy paces the edges of the action, restless, edgy.


INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER

Willy stops in the doorway - watching a DEPUTY shut the stainless-steel freezer, open a wired-glass cabinet and poke around.

WILLY
Shake the boxes.

DEPUTY
Huh?

WILLY
The cereal boxes - shake ’em. And there’s a chicken in the freezer. Thaw it out, check inside.

The Deputy stares like he’s nuts. Willy doesn’t blink. The Deputy goes to shake the boxes, eyes on Willy: okay?

Willy nods.	Moves on.


EXT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - LATER

Hours have passed.
 
60


Willy steps out of the front door, because he’s going stir-crazy inside. Stands watching two TECHS walk the lawn and flower-beds with metal detectors.

He notices, past the S.I.D. vans and Sheriff’s Dept. black-and-whites parked in the driveway:

Nunally, in his parked car, across the street.

He meets Willy’s eyes.	Worried.

Willy can’t give him any news. So he pretends he didn’t see the question in Nunally’s eyes, looks away. Takes a breath, turns and goes back in to work.


INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DUSK

It’s getting dark out. Techs pack equipment cases, carry them out. The place is a disaster area.

Marchand watches Willy pace the living room.

WILLY
The garage?	Washer-dryer?

MARCHAND
And the tool shed, and the roof, and the H.V.A.C. ducts.

WILLY
What about the door frames?	The
floors?

MARCHAND
What did he do: rip open a door frame, hide the gun inside and re-plaster the wall before SWAT showed up?

WILLY
What about the neighbors’ property? He could have thrown it over the hedges.

MARCHAND
We checked.
(Beat)

He might have passed it off to somebody, Willy. Had an accomplice, waiting, out the back.

Willy shakes his head, grim.	Pacing.
 
61


WILLY
This isn’t an accomplice sort of guy.

He slows. Looking across the room at the big Rube Goldberg device. As he moves toward it:

WILLY
This is a...guy who likes to show off.

He examines the intricate workings, eyes travelling the clutter of metal and wires and motors.

Checks Marchand - who shakes his head.

WILLY
You sure?

MARCHAND
I’m sure.

Willy grimaces.	Fuming, relentless:

WILLY
It’s a physical object. It can’t just vanish. We’re missing something - some step in the story.

He begins walking through the crime, "the stations of the cross" - re-enacting it, starting from the front door, methodical, reciting it to himself:

WILLY
The neighbor sees her get home. He’s already inside. She lets herself in. A minute or two later: blood-pattern says she’s standing over there - he’s somewhere around here.

Willy stands where Crawford was.	Raises a finger-gun.

WILLY
Boom.

As Willy goes to where Jennifer fell:

MARCHAND
But then he carries her back there.
Why?

Willy walks along the path defined by the drops of blood:
 
62


WILLY
Because he’s gonna need time. To confess. When she’s alone with the cop.

Willy stops in the alcove, looking down at the dried blood, the discarded paramedic-supply-wrappers.

MARCHAND
Neighbor comes to the door.

Willy nods, comes out - crosses to the foyer:

WILLY
Crawford shouts, "Leave us alone" and fires three more rounds: boom-boom-boom.

MARCHAND
So everybody knows he’s dangerous - and she might still be alive.

WILLY
So they’ll call the Negotiator.
(Beat)
Now he’s got about ten minutes.

And that’s it. He stands there with the imaginary gun in his hand. Looking around. Trying to think like Crawford.

He can’t.

MARCHAND
I’m sorry, Willy.

Willy won’t respond - because accepting the apology means admitting he’s got nothing left.


INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - LATER

It’s night. The house is empty. Except for Willy, turning on lights as he gets to each room, turning them off as he leaves.

WILLY (V.O.)
Do you dare stay out?
Do you dare go in?

Studying framed photos: Jennifer - now and then with Crawford - in Italy, Bermuda, Colorado. Always a bit posed and formal when they’re together.
 
63


WILLY (V.O.)
And IF you go in -
Should you turn left or right?
Or right and three-quarters?
Or maybe not quite.


INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - BATHROOM - SOON AFTER

Checking the contents of the medicine cabinet.

WILLY (V.O.)
You can get so confused that you’ll start in to race,

Down long wiggled roads at break-necking pace

No longer really looking for the gun. He’s looking for insight. Contact. A way in.


INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - DRESSING ROOM - SOON AFTER

Willy wanders through Jennifer’s spacious dressing room.

WILLY (V.O.)
And grind on for miles across weirdish wild space,

Headed I fear, toward a most useless place.

He idly surveys the vanity, cluttered with cosmetics, skin-care products. Lifts her perfume, sniffs.

WILLY (V.O.)
The Waiting Place...
For people just waiting.
Waiting for a train to go
Or a bus to come, or a plane to go

Notices a storage box on the floor, left partly-open in the search. He shifts the lid aside.

WILLY (V.O.)
Or the mail to come, or the rain to go Or the phone to ring, or the snow to snow

A high-school yearbook.	An old photo album.	A teddy bear.
A snow-globe.	A well-worn book by Dr. Seuss.
 
64


WILLY (V.O.)
Or waiting around for a Yes or No
Or waiting for their hair to grow.
Everyone is just waiting.

Willy stares down at the souvenirs of a lost life.


INT. HOSPITAL - I.C.U. - NIGHT

The room is dim, and silent except for the hiss-click of the respirator, the monotonous beep of the heart monitor.

WILLY (V.O.)
Waiting for the fish to bite

Or waiting for wind to fly a kite Or waiting around for Friday night Or waiting perhaps for their Uncle Jake

Jennifer Crawford lies with her head wrapped in gauze, eyes shut, plastic tubing down her throat held in place with tape.

Willy sits beside her bed, reading Dr. Seuss:

WILLY
Or a pot to boil, or a Better Break Or a string of pearls, or a pair of pants
Or a wig with curls...
Or Another Chance.

He stops reading a moment.	Watching her:

RESIDENT (O.S.)
What are you doing?

Willy turns. A work-weary RESIDENT comes past him to check the I.V.’s and monitors. He’s about Willy’s age.

WILLY
I heard it might - help - if somebody talked to her.

RESIDENT
Who told you that?

WILLY
(Reluctantly)
The man who shot her.

The RESIDENT looks up at Willy - who shrugs, uncomfortable.
 
65


WILLY
Is there any chance...she might come out of this?

RESIDENT
Are you a member of the family?

WILLY
(Getting out ID)
Sorry.	I’m with the District
Attorney’s office.
(Beat)
We don’t have any other witnesses.

RESIDENT
This woman had a bullet plow through her brain.

WILLY
I know. But you hear about people waking up from comas. After everybody said pull the plug - they wake up.
(Beat)
You hear stuff like that all the time.

RESIDENT
You hear about Elvis and Aliens, too.
All the time.

WILLY
It’s not impossible, though. Is it? I mean - why else are you keeping her like this?

Beat.	The Resident sighs.

RESIDENT
No. It’s not impossible. But even if she did, she might not remember how to talk - let alone anything about how she was shot.

WILLY
When I was here alone before, she moved a little.

RESIDENT
Are you just going to keep asking the same question in different ways until you hear the answer you want?

Beat.
 
66


WILLY
That’s how it works with the law.

RESIDENT
I knew I should have gone to law
school.

Willy watches the Resident go out. Then he looks back down at Jennifer. Listening to the machines.


INT. CRAWFORD OFFICE - THE NEXT DAY

Willy wanders.	Tina, the assistant, waits in the doorway.

He’s trying to conceal the fact that he’s on a fishing expedition.

WILLY
So this is all exactly how he left it.

TINA
Yes.

Browses a wall of framed photos: Crawford at crash sites, universities, engineering test-labs - awards, certificates, articles from industry publications lauding Crawford as the Go-To-Guy for investigating mechanical failures of aircraft.

WILLY
And he was - distraught.

TINA
He was drinking.	The past few weeks.

WILLY
But he was working on this.

He stands over unfinished Rube Goldberg device. Tools laid out on the work table - meticulous, organized.

WILLY
All distraught and everything.

It’s not evidence.

TINA
Do you want coffee. He said I should ask.

Willy turns, a little rattled.	Beat.
 
67


WILLY
Tell him I said no thank you.


INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

The room where Jennifer and Nunally met. Cleaned-up now, anonymous, empty. Willy stands looking at it.

There’s nothing to see. He grimaces, nods - heads out, past the ASSISTANT MANAGER waiting in the doorway.


INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

As Willy comes out of the room - he slows, noticing the little gray plastic surveillance-camera-ball in the ceiling.

WILLY
How long do you keep the tapes?

ASSISTANT MANAGER
A month.

Willy considers it.	He’s got nothing else to try.

WILLY
Can I get a copy of October 9th?

ASSISTANT MANAGER
I’ll have it for you Friday.

WILLY
I’m kind of under the gun here.

ASSISTANT MANAGER
We’re short-staffed tonight and
tomorrow.

Beat.	Seeing Willy’s confusion:

ASSISTANT MANAGER
Thanksgiving?

Willy nods, trying to pretend he hasn’t forgotten:

WILLY
Right.	Okay.
 
68


INT. GARDNER HOUSE - DINING ROOM - LATER

A faux-Tudor Hancock Park dining room. Wealthy, but lived in.

JUDGE LEWIS GARDNER, your basic Henry Fonda/Jimmy Stewart-type patriarch, carves a turkey at the head of a long table, wearing a worn and gravy-splattered apron. Platters circulate in both directions among Nikki’s older siblings (BURTON and SANDRA), their spouses, their children.

Willy sits next to Nikki, who is high-stylish despite the fact that she’s dressed "casual."

GARDNER
White or dark, Willy?

WILLY
Anything is fine, your honor.

GARDNER
I’m off-duty, you can call me Lew.

While Gardner piles turkey on a plate and passes it:

WILLY
So - is everyone in this family
involved in the law?

SANDRA
Well, Nikki’s not.

NIKKI
Ha ha.
(To Willy:)

Burton’s a counsel for Sierra Club, and Sandra’s ACLU - so they use the holidays as an opportunity to give me a hard time, because I can buy and sell them.

SANDRA
We’re not actually for sale, Nick.

Nikki gives Willy a did-I-tell-you? look.

GARDNER
Nicole decided early-on that black sheep was the most effective role in which to distinguish herself from her siblings.
 
69


NIKKI
You know of any other family in America where the corporate lawyer who’s going to make partner by thirty-five is the "black sheep"?

GARDNER
Well - you may be lost beyond
recovery, but maybe we can still
convince Willy that defending giant
corporations against injured citizens
is not the best use of his skills.

WILLY
I don’t think so, sir.
(smiles)
It’s where the money is.

GARDNER
(Scolding mildly)
I believe that phrase refers to banks.
And it was coined by a thief.

Beat.	Willy remains polite, but won’t back down.

WILLY
Times have changed.

NIKKI
(To Willy)
You don’t have to do this.

WILLY
I don’t mind; I get this kind of thing now and then.
(to Gardner)
Almost always from people with money.

GARDNER
Appearances can be deceiving, Willy. I grew up with eight brothers and sisters on a farm up in Fresno, and I promise you I saw my share of hard times.

Willy considers his options.

WILLY
My mom OD’d fairly frequently, so they put me in a Group Home. My younger sister is dead and my older brother is doing twenty-five-to-life.
 
70


Awkward silence.

GARDNER
You win.

Beat.	Willy looks down, begins to eat again.

WILLY
I usually do.

GARDNER
(Gently)
Yes.	I see that.

BURTON
I don’t know if you will against the wife-shooter, though.

The click of silverware.

SANDRA
Whoops.

NIKKI
Nice, Burton.

Beat.	Willy looks up at Burton, steady.	Shrugs.

WILLY
It’s not over ’til it’s over.

BURTON
That looked pretty over.

NIKKI
Anyway, Willy’s been taken off the case.

GARDNER
It might not seem like it now, but that’s a blessing in disguise, Willy.

Willy nods.	Beat.	To Nikki, uncomfortable:

WILLY
I	wasn’t. Nikki looks at Willy.

NIKKI
What?
 
71


WILLY
Taken off.

NIKKI
That...doesn’t make any sense. Lobruto has to do some kind of damage control -

WILLY
I asked him not to.

Silence.	Nikki is staring at him.	Angry.

NIKKI
You are really stupid, did you know that?

Willy doesn’t know how to handle this; everyone else tries to be polite, eating and pretending not to notice.

WILLY
I’m - getting new evidence -

NIKKI
Where? The Evidence Store?! Oh, that’s right - they open early the day after Thanksgiving. You’re gonna be fine!

WILLY
Did it ever occur to you I might be good enough to still win?!

NIKKI
Win what?	Who cares?!

WILLY
The man shot his -

NIKKI
You wanted corporate, right?! You wanted to play in the big leagues?!

WILLY
Yeah, I’m just -

NIKKI
You go to all that trouble getting yourself in - and then you just pay no attention to wh-
 
72


WILLY
Look - I’m sorry - can we not talk
about this here?!

Nikki stops. Refusing to look around. Ashamed at losing control, turns back to her food:

NIKKI
Fine.

WILLY
Thank you.

Everyone eats in silence a moment - then Nikki tosses down her napkin:

NIKKI
I need to talk with you.

She gets up and walks out of the room. With an awkward glance around, Willy excuses himself and follows her.


EXT. GARDNER HOUSE - FOYER - CONTINUOUS

WILLY
Look, I’m sorry I didn’t tell you -

NIKKI
Did you hear me, when I said Bob wanted you gone as soon as this thing broke?! Did you hear me say I went out on a limb to convince him -

WILLY
Wouldn’t it be better than damage control if I actually turn it around?

NIKKI
And what if you don’t?

Willy has no answer. He doesn’t think that way. And she sees that. She sees a young man from Oklahoma, in way over his head. Desperate to get through:

NIKKI
You don’t get it at all, do you?!	You
pulled a stunt to get yourself this
job.	Fine: you’re a hot-shot!
(Beat)
Wooton Sims does not need hot-shots.
Because you don’t win.	The firm wins.
Bob wins.
(MORE)
 
73


NIKKI (cont’d)
(Beat)
And you just put yourself head-to-head
in conflict with Bob.

Silence.	Shaken:

WILLY
What am I supposed to do?

NIKKI
We told the man you’re getting on a plane to Chicago, Tuesday.

Painful silence.

WILLY
Yeah.	Okay.

Nikki watches him dealing with it, sympathetic. The impossible feelings always running under the surface for them have developed a darker, aching tone. If anything, stronger.

WILLY
I think maybe I’m gonna go now.

NIKKI
All right.
(Beat)
Call if you want.

He nods. Neither one moves. Judge Gardner enters cautiously from the dining room - breaking the spell.

Nikki nods goodbye to Willy, and goes out quickly without meeting her father’s eye. Awkward pause.
