WILLY
I’ve got some work to do.
I need to call a cab.

Gardner nods respectfully, but doesn’t move quite yet.
Studying the torn-up young man.

GARDNER
You know what nobody understands about certain kinds of underpaid public service work? Now and then you get to put a fucking stake in a bad guy’s heart. We’re not supposed to talk about that when we visit a third-grade class on Career Day, and it doesn’t get you very far into the country-club locker room - but it’s hard to beat when you actually get to do it.
 
74


Willy looks at the kindly old judge, a little surprised.

Gardner shrugs: my two cents. He goes to a side-table, finds the Yellow Pages.


INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT

Empty.	Dark.	Willy lets himself in.

He looks for the light-switch - finds only a complex computerized dimmer-panel. He tries it.

Accent lights come on, buried in the living room planters.
He can’t get any other pre-sets to work.

The crime scene is creepy, lit like that. The dried blood is black. Shadows stretch up the walls, strange.

Willy grimaces, moves through it - sees another panel by the French doors to the garden. Goes over -

- and jumps back, startled -

WILLY
Shit!

- by Nunally, on the other side of the glass.

Catching his breath, Willy stares. He unlocks the French doors and Nunally steps in, uneasy, haggard.

WILLY
The hell are you doing here?

Nunally looks around - taking a pint bottle from his overcoat pocket, uncapping it.

NUNALLY
We need to talk.

He drinks, then offers the bottle. Willy hesitates, takes it. As he drinks:

NUNALLY
We have to find the gun.

Willy winces at the liquor and the remark, hands back the bottle.

WILLY
Thank you, Professor Einstein.	It
would also be good to find a couple of
(MORE)
 
75


WILLY (cont’d) eyewitnesses. If one could be the Dalai Lama, it would be even better.

NUNALLY
No - Willy: we need to find the gun.

WILLY
I’ve had three different teams here -

NUNALLY
He didn’t leave between the shooting and when we took him out in cuffs. The gun is here.
(beat)
So we have to find it.

WILLY
Well - we can’t!	You want to move on?

Nunally tosses something from an inside pocket of the coat -

-	Willy catches it. A Heckler & Koch nine-millimeter in a plastic bag.

Willy stares down at it. Then at Nunally, who holds up: a bullet, deformed by impact.

NUNALLY
There’s a guy in the Evidence Room, owes me a favor. Well - it’s not so much a favor as I know stuff about him. He can trade this for the bullet from Jennifer, give us a ballistic match.

Beat.

WILLY
It’s a crime.

NUNALLY
So who’s gonna get away with a crime - this asshole, or us?

Willy sighs.	Tosses the gun back.

WILLY
Go home.

NUNALLY
What else have you got?!

WILLY
I’ll find a way.
 
76


Beat.

NUNALLY
No you won’t.

Willy watches Nunally stalk out through the big, strangely-lit room. The front door opens, and slams.

A little worried, Willy takes a deep breath.	Gets to work.
He still has three days to break this open.

Walking through the crime again.

Playing it out in his mind. Standing in different places, getting different perspectives.

Willy stands in the alcove.	Looking around.

There’s something here.	But he can’t get it.

His eye falls on the Rube Goldberg device. Moves closer, peering into the mechanism.

Turns away: no gun. But now he’s facing the big wooden bowl of ball-bearings, sitting out in the middle of the room on the coffee table.

Hide in plain sight.

He walks over - pushes his fingers in, feels around.

Nope.	He sighs.	Takes a ball-bearing, rolls it in his hand.
Goes to the device - drops the ball in the slot.

The machine is amazing. The ball rolls and leaps and clatters - lights flash, elevators rise and fall, at one point the ball lifts on a jet of compressed air - then it spirals out of sight and reappears somewhere unexpected -

-	until at the end the ball suddenly catapults out and sails across the living room -

-	to land neatly back in the bowl on the coffee table. Willy grimaces. This guy is really good.

INT. MARCHAND’S OFFICE - S.I.D. - SUNDAY AFTERNOON

A mess of courtroom exhibits, copies of evidence, lists, depositions, photos, diagrams, take-out food containers and coffee cups.
 
77


Marchand surveys it. The bleary end of a long day - sifting clues, dead-ends.

MARCHAND
Willy.	There’s nothing here.

Willy has barely slept all weekend. He shakes his head, reviewing the hotel surveillance tapes on a VCR/TV, stubborn.

WILLY
Guns don’t just walk out of crime scenes.

Marchand waves copies of Crawford’s evidence - stills printed from home-video Dick took at a hostage negotiation: Nunally doing his job, his methods, his routine.

MARCHAND
Two months before he shot his wife, this guy had his investigator watching the cop at work. He knew exactly how it would go down - and he didn’t leave any loose ends.

WILLY
Then what is this:

Willy uses the remote. On the TV, in black-and-white: Jennifer and Nunally come out of their room and head for the pool - indistinct figures zip jerkily in and out of rooms on fast-forward -

-	until he slows it: Crawford comes to let himself in.

WILLY
Hotel surveillance.	From that day.
He was there.	Why?

Marchand watches over Willy’s shoulder.	Shrugs.

MARCHAND
Had to see it for himself.

WILLY
See what?	They were out at the pool.

MARCHAND
The unmade bed. Her panties. Man’s gonna shoot his wife in the head, he needs to get himself all worked up.

Willy stares at the grainy black-and-white figure emerging from the room, walking away down the corridor. Unconvinced:
 
78


WILLY
Yeah.	Worked up.

Marchand gets his jacket, pulls it on.

MARCHAND
Willy, go home. Tomorrow you go back into court and take your lumps - then you start your cushy new life, and you forget all about this one.

(Hoping to get a smile:) And then you can lend me money and shit.

Willy says nothing. Runs the tape back and then slow-motions it forward again.

Marchand goes out.	Leaving Willy alone, watching Crawford.

DISSOLVE TO:


INT. WILLY’S APARTMENT - VERY LATE THAT NIGHT

Willy stands over crime scene photos and diagrams spread out on his narrow futon. "Walking the scene" again, on paper. The whole apartment is an array of law books, notes, exhibits, marked-up depositions.

He’s staring at evidence he’s already stared at a hundred times.

He grinds the palms of his hands into his eye sockets, a dull moan rising into a yell -

- as he sweeps everything off his bed in a storm of paper - throwing books - tearing up printouts - pulling out drawers, emptying them, smashing them on the desk -

-	yelling in a frenzy until his throat is hoarse, his shabby garage apartment is trashed, and he’s sitting, exhausted, in his chair.

There’s a knock on the door.

Willy frowns, checking the clock: it’s two-thirty a.m. He goes to open it -

-	revealing Nunally, standing in the darkness, a haunted shadow of the boyish confident cop we met making love to Jennifer Crawford.
 
79


NUNALLY
It’s done. In the tool shed: taped to the blade, inside the lawn-mower.

Before Willy can say anything - Nunally walks away.

Willy doesn’t move. Watching the tormented cop disappear down the alley.


INT. DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE - BULLPEN - THE NEXT MORNING

Willy - in a clean suit and crisp suit, carrying his briefcase - hurries through, paying no attention to the SECRETARIES and OTHER D.D.A.s who watch like he’s on his way to his own execution.

At his office door, he gestures for Mona to come in with him.

Surprised, she gets up - taking with her an envelope with a messenger-receipt taped to the front.


INT. WILLY’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Mona watches Willy shut the door behind her.

MONA
You okay?

WILLY
Yeah.	Maybe.
(Hesitates)

Can I ask you to do something for me this morning?

MONA
Sure.

WILLY
Write down your cell number.
(As she does)

Once my trial is in session, wait outside. I might call - and just hang up. If I do, I want you to come into court and whisper to me that we got a tip about the murder weapon.

MONA
You found it?

Beat.
 
80


WILLY
I haven’t decided yet.

Mona studies Willy - then accepts it’s don’t-ask-don’t-tell, hands him her number. Willy nods, grateful.

Turning for the door, she remembers the envelope in her hand.

MONA
Oh: this came for you.

He takes it, and as she leaves, checks the return address:
Wooton Sims.

Willy grimaces, opens it. Inside are an airline ticket to Chicago - first class - and a handwritten note, on Wooton Sims stationery:

We only win the favor of the Gods
by making a sacrifice

See you tomorrow
- Nikki

He stands in his empty office, considering the ticket and the note.


INT. COURTHOUSE - CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

Willy steps off the elevator, into a crowd of REPORTERS AND SPECTATORS outside the courtroom.

He’s startled for a moment: it’s worse than he expected - the dense buzz of talk in the marble corridor and all the eyes tracking him like he’s walking into an arena - a freakshow performer -

-	but he doesn’t slow, ignoring the comments and questions, avoiding eye contact -

-	until he sees Nunally by the courtroom doors, his eyes fixed on Willy.

Willy meets Nunally’s gaze...moving on, giving back nothing.

Nunally watches Willy disappear into the courtroom, stares at the closing doors - uncertain, on edge. Lost, no matter which way this goes.
 
81


INT. COURTROOM - SOON AFTER

Mr. Gifford, the Crawford’s neighbor, is on the stand. Willy questions him, standing by the Prosecution Table.

Behind him, the court is standing-room-only. REPORTERS, SKETCH ARTISTS, SPECTATORS. Nunally, sitting near the front. Lobruto, standing at the back.

Crawford writes intently on a legal pad, filling pages with dense scribble.

WILLY
So - between the time you heard the
first gunshot and called 911, and the
time of Mr. Crawford’s arrest - you
had the Crawford house in view?

GIFFORD
Yes.	I was very concerned about
Jennifer.	She was a lovely woman.

WILLY
No one but Thomas Crawford came in or out?

GIFFORD
That’s correct.

WILLY
Thank you, Mr. Gifford. No further questions.

JUDGE ROBINSON
Mr. Crawford?

Crawford glances up at the Judge. Then at Gifford, as if he’s just noticed him up there. Beat. Without getting up:

CRAWFORD
Did you see the guy run out the back door?

GIFFORD
What..."guy"?

CRAWFORD
The other guy. The one who shot my wife. Did you see him run out the back of the house, carrying the gun?

Willy closes his eyes.	Gifford grimaces.
 
82


GIFFORD
I couldn’t see the back of the house.
(Trying to salvage it:)

I believe...the police went around back when they arrived.

CRAWFORD
No further questions.

Willy immediately stands:

WILLY
Re-direct, your honor.

But Crawford is standing too - with his handful of pages:

CRAWFORD
I’ve also written a motion to dismiss.

WILLY
Objection - I’m on re-direct!

The Judge hesitates.	Both men standing.

JUDGE ROBINSON
On what grounds, Mr. Crawford?

CRAWFORD
The prosecutor doesn’t have any actual evidence.

WILLY
I’m in the middle of presenting -

CRAWFORD
All of his witnesses are going to testify to the same facts: that my wife was shot and that I was, tragically, in the house at the time

...a witness - and, in a way, a victim myself. I’ll stipulate to Mr. Slocum’s entire witness list right now, a request a directed verdict or dismissal, per California versus Collier, 1982, and the Appellate court decision, v. Watrus, 486.19.

Willy stares at Crawford, stunned. As the Judge reluctantly nods to the Bailiff to collect Crawford’s pages and opens a law book:
 
83


JUDGE
Your legal skills seem to have improved over the long weekend, Mr. Crawford.

While the Judge checks the citations, Crawford glances at Willy. Amused.

Beat. Willy looks down - reaches into his briefcase, moves his cell-phone out from under some papers. To where he can get it easily.

Looks back up at Crawford.	Smiles slightly.

JUDGE ROBINSON
Mr. Slocum?

Willy and Crawford turn to the Judge.

JUDGE ROBINSON
Have you got any new evidence?

Beat.

WILLY
May I have a moment, your honor?

The Judge nods.

Willy nods down. Trying to focus. He’s got nothing, and everyone in the room knows it. He can hear it, he can feel it. There’s a restless, hungry edge to the crowded courtroom.

He stares into his open briefcase: the cell phone.

Next to it: the first class ticket and Nikki’s note.

Willy glances back at the gallery. Nunally’s eyes burn into him. In the back: Lobruto frowns, concerned.

JUDGE ROBINSON
Mr. Slocum?

Willy turns back to his briefcase. He breathes. Press the MENU button - selects SPEED DIAL.

On the tiny screen, a list of names.	Selected: MONA/CELL.
 
84


INT. COURTHOUSE - CORRIDOR - THE SAME TIME

Mona sits on a bench, a few steps down the corridor from the courtroom doors. Cell phone in her hand.


INT. COURTROOM - CONTINUOUS

Willy stands at the Prosecution Table. Hearing his own pulse.

Crawford studies Willy, curious.

CRAWFORD
Your honor? Can we signal the prosecutor from here on planet Earth?

Willy’s fingertip hovers over the cell phone keypad. Press, and a path is chosen. Possibly for life.

Next to the cell-phone, the ticket and the note. See you tomorrow.

Nunally sits forward.	Lobruto is watching intently.

Willy doesn’t move.

JUDGE ROBINSON
Mr. Slocum?	Now or never.

Willy won’t look up.

Nunally stares, agonized.

Willy grimaces slightly, as if he feels his soul burning up, turning to ash and blowing away -

-	nods, closing the cell phone, sliding it under Nikki’s note. Shuts the briefcase. Looks at the Judge.

WILLY
I have no further evidence at this time, your honor.

Crawford begins to smile.

Lobruto looks down.	A buzz rises in the gallery -

-	as Nunally gets up, furious - stalks to the doors, slams out.
 
85


Judge Robinson looks at Willy a moment - then at Crawford, who has been waiting, calm and polite. Very reluctantly:

JUDGE ROBINSON
Motion to dismiss is granted.

Uproar.	The Judge bangs his gavel -

JUDGE ROBINSON
Order! The jury is released, with our apologies -

-	practically shouting over the chaos - REPORTERS hastily heading for the doors, pulling out cell phones -

JUDGE ROBINSON
-	and the Defendant is free to go. Crawford gives the Judge a gentlemanly bow of the head.

Willy begins to pack his papers into the briefcase. Refusing to look up.

The Judge and the Bailiff might be saying other things, but no one is listening - SPECTATORS swarm up the aisles, out to the hallway - and the Court starts to close down.

Crawford comes over to Willy, holds out a hand.

Willy looks him in the eye.	Doesn’t move.	Crawford shrugs.

CRAWFORD
Even a broken clock gets to be right twice a day.

He winks, and heads up the aisle.

As Willy watches Crawford go out the doors into a clamor of lenses, hand-held mikes, white-hot halogen glare and flashes -

-	he hears a buzzing noise. Looks down at his briefcase, moves the papers aside: his cell phone is vibrating.

Willy stares at it, as if he’d forgotten the thing could be used for an incoming call.

The caller ID reads: WOOTON SIMS.	He picks up -

INTERCUT WITH:
 
86


INT. WOOTON SIMS - NIKKI’S OFFICE - THE SAME TIME

Nikki sits at her beautiful desk with stellar views out the windows behind her.

NIKKI
Hey, you.

WILLY
(It’s an effort)
Hey.

NIKKI
What did you think - I wasn’t keeping tabs?

WILLY
I don’t know what I thought.

Awkward silence.	She tries to get past it:

NIKKI
Listen: what do you say I take you out tonight and get you completely trashed? Tomorrow’s just a travel da-

- there’s a gun shot outside the courtroom.

Willy turns.	Shocked.	Screams and shouting in the corridor.

WILLY
Hang on -

We move with Willy as he shuts the phone and heads for the doors - faster, pushing out -


INT. COURTHOUSE - CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

-	into the echoing chaos of the corridor - trying to move in the crowd -

-	shoving through to where people are yelling and clustered around a figure lying on the floor.

Willy pushes closer, until he catches glimpses of:

Nunally. Lying on the marble floor. His gun in his lifeless fingers. Blood all over, from his head.

Willy stops pushing. Won’t let himself look away - the screams and commotion around him retreating into a numb blur.
 
87


Then suddenly Willy looks up - as if he’s been called -

-	to find Crawford, standing very still, in the crowd, on the other side of the body. Everyone else is moving, talking, gawking at the body or averting their eyes -

-	except Crawford.  He’s looking straight at Willy.

Pleased.	Triumphant.

Willy stares into Crawford’s eyes.


INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - LATE THAT NIGHT

The life support system clicks and hisses and beeps. Jennifer is curled into a fetal position, despite the tubes and wires.

Willy sits by her bed. Still in his suit from court, the jacket off, the tie loose.

He’s been there a while.	But now he speaks.

WILLY
Your husband said something...that I can’t seem to shake loose of. He said I’m a winner.
(Beat)

And he’s right. I can’t lose. I can’t stand people who lose.
(Beat)
I may have been working so hard to put some distance between me and...people like you - that maybe I messed up. I don’t know if did anything wrong.

Or what I should have done. I really don’t know, any more...what I’m supposed to do.
(Beat)

But I feel like I let you down. Somehow in the...process. And if I did, I’m sorry. That’s all. I just - I hope you...have...just, some...
(Beat)
Anyway.

He feels stupid. Takes a breath. Looking at her pale, drawn, comatose face.

He stands, goes to get his jacket, lying folded on a table by the door. Pulls it on, settles the shoulders, tugs at his cuffs. Gets his briefcase.
 
88


He goes to the door, and as he opens it - he looks back.

Freezes.

Jennifer’s eyes are wide open.

She’s staring at him. Willy stands, breathless, watching her.


INT. HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR - LATER

Sliding glass doors suck open, Willy walks with the Resident from the other night:

WILLY
She was looking at me.

RESIDENT
Yeah, I understand -

WILLY
No, she was looking at me.


CLOSE UP - JENNIFER’S EYEBALL

A beam of light slides across it.


INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The Resident tucks his flashlight in a pocket, draws a pin from his lapel. Gently sticks Jennifer’s cheek. Willy winces, watching.

WILLY
She’s reacting.

The Resident ignores him. Pricks her forehead - her chin - her big toe. Each time she twitches. He runs his thumb along the sole of Jennifer’s bare foot. It arches up.

WILLY
You see?

RESIDENT
The normal reflex goes downward. Up indicates brain trauma.

WILLY
She’s in there. She was looking at me.
 
89


The Resident sighs.	Sympathetic, but plain:

RESIDENT
Sometimes we have to tape their eyes shut. They all move - they make sounds, they twitch. You think they’re dreaming. But they’re not. It’s just what’s left of the system, sending broken signals.

WILLY
Can we do other tests? Like an M.R.I. or something? And I want a coma specialist to see her.

RESIDENT
You’re not authorized to order tes-

WILLY
I’ll get you authorization. First thing tomorrow.

The Resident studies Willy.	Reluctantly:

RESIDENT
You get the paperwork, I’ll do what I can.

Willy nods, grateful. As the Resident heads out, Willy sits by Jennifer’s bed - protective, intent.


INT. HOSPITAL - LOBBY - THE NEXT MORNING

Crawford comes in through the lobby: rested, well-dressed. A free man. He slows, surprised -

-	seeing Willy come off the elevators. Willy hasn’t left Jennifer’s bedside. He’s in the same suit and carrying his briefcase from the courthouse.

CRAWFORD
Mr. Slocum.

WILLY
Just...visiting.

CRAWFORD
This isn’t like you at all.

WILLY
No?
 
90


CRAWFORD
You haven’t got anything to gain.

WILLY
Oh - right.	That’s my weak spot.
(Beat)
Ever think about what yours might be?
Your flaw?

CRAWFORD
Of course I have.
(Leans in)

The truth about me is, Willy...I’m really not very nice.

Willy nods.	Concealing the ace up his sleeve.

WILLY
You sure do know a lot, though. Got everybody all figured out, everything set up, like one of your contraptions. Then you just sit back and watch it all fall right where you want it to. Must be kind of...boring. At that point.

CRAWFORD
Not an ounce of sympathy, Willy?
(Beat)
Imagine it - imagine she was yours.
And you knew you were losing her.
(beat)
Imagine days. Weeks. Going through her desk. Her purse. Her closet. Alone. Staring at her clothes. Her shoes. Knowing this is what it will be like. After.
(beat)

Do you have any idea how hard it was to go on living - with her - every day, knowing?

WILLY
But you had to, right? You needed time to set it all up...your "crime of passion."

CRAWFORD
There are many kinds of passion,
Willy.
 
91


WILLY
Yeah.	There are.
(Beat)
So - thank you.

Crawford frowns.	Starting to feel wary.	Willy sees it.
Enjoys it.

WILLY
For sharing your wisdom. All your little helpful bits of information.
(Beat)
You were right.

CRAWFORD
About...?

WILLY
Talking to her.

Beat.	Willy winks.	He goes past Crawford and out the doors.

Crawford doesn’t move - except to turn and watch Willy.
Uncertain, for the first time since we’ve met him.


INT. WOOTON SIMS - RECEPTION - LATER THAT MORNING

Willy - still unshaved, unslept, in yesterday’s suit - comes off the elevator, fishing out ID as he passes a RECEPTIONIST:

WILLY
Hi, I’m just -

- going directly to the key-card slot by the glass double-doors to the rest of the floor. He swipes his card and pulls the handle -

- but it stays locked.	Willy swipes his card again.	No go.

WILLY
Excuse me - I’m new, I just started - and there’s something wrong with my card. Can you buzz me in?

RECEPTIONIST
Who are you here to see?

WILLY
I work here.	Willy Slocum.	I’m new -

He stops, realizing how he must look.
 
92


WILLY
Nikki Gardner.	Willy Slocum, for
Nikki Gardner.

As he calls in, Willy sees Nikki through the doors - one of a half-dozen ASSOCIATES trailing in the wake of BOB WOOTON. They all carry expensive business luggage, except Wooton - who is powerful, perfectly groomed, and two decades older.

WILLY
Wait a second - never mind, here she is, thank you.

Willy goes toward the glass doors as Wooton comes through - nodding deferentially to the boss, semi-apologetic:

WILLY
Hey...Bob -
(To Nikki)
Can I talk to you for a second?

Wooton glances back at Nikki, eyes saying: don’t take long.

She nods as Wooton and the team continue to the elevators - staying back by the glass doors to talk with Willy:

WILLY
You let him know what happened last night?

NIKKI
I told him.

WILLY
Great - who do I work with on it while
you’re gone?

NIKKI
You don’t work with anyone.

WILLY
Nikki: the man has power-of-attorney and a health-care proxy, he can disconnect her life-support whenever he wants. If we don’t move fast -

Nikki explodes - but quietly, not wanting the team to hear:

NIKKI
Jesus, Willy, wake up!	It’s over!
What is wrong with you - it’s first
year law: that woman could fully
recover and swear he shot her and it
(MORE)
 
93


NIKKI (cont’d) wouldn’t matter. Double jeopardy! You can’t take him back into court!

WILLY
I told you - we bring a civil suit -

NIKKI
You’ve got no standing.

WILLY
It doesn’t have to stick: we just need to get a court order for now - to keep Crawford from pulling the plug! With all the brain-power here, I’m sure somebody can come up with a pretext or call in a favor. Then we can tie this up in court while we arrange a state-appointed conservatorship - so we can protect her while we fight him on -

NIKKI
What’s the point, Willy?

WILLY
The point?!

Willy stares. Because she’s drawn a line in the sand. One he already crossed, without truly understanding...and now he’s standing out there alone - feeling the sand slither away under his feet.

WILLY
This man is going to kill his wife.

NIKKI
Yeah.
(Beat)

What does that have to do with Wooton Sims?

Willy just breathes. Vulnerable like we have never seen him before.

He looks across the big reception area, at Wooton and the team of associates. Some look away.

NIKKI
I warned you.

WILLY
No, this is insane.

NIKKI
It’s what it is.
 
94


Ding!	The elevator.	Nikki grimaces, frustrated - and sad:

NIKKI
I warned you.

She starts for the elevators, Willy following -

WILLY
You’re not really just gonna let this happen, are you?!

NIKKI
Oh I’m supposed to lose my job over your problems?!

WILLY
My problems?! Wait a second - this is not about my anything any more -

Willy grabs Nikki’s arm to stop her, turn her around - and she shoves him away, hard, tears welling in her eyes -

-	Willy letting her go - as the Receptionist quietly calls for help -

-	and Nikki hurries into the waiting elevator. The Associate holding the doors lets them go.

WILLY
This is about taking a couple of goddamn weeks off to try and save a woman’s life!

The doors begin to close. Willy stands facing the cluster of lawyers in expensive suits, their expressions ranging from pity to contempt -

-	except Nikki, whose eyes are full of shame and guilt and defensive anger.

As the doors shut across them.

Willy doesn’t move.	Confused, humiliated, frustrated.

He turns when a bunch of OTHER LAWYERS emerge from the offices, ready to act as bouncers. People gawk from behind the glass doors.

Beat.	Willy holds up his palms.

WILLY
Don’t bother.	I got it.
 
95







He bangs open the paddle-sign on the stairway door, setting off the fire alarms as he stalks out.


INT. WOOTON SIMS - BUILDING STAIRWAY - SOON AFTER

Willy runs down the stairs furiously -

-	the clanging alarm, several floors above now, a little fainter.

He suddenly stops - clinging to the railing, bent over. He sways, dizzy, gasping -

-	backs up until he’s against the concrete wall. Presses himself against. Listening to his own ragged breathing.

Scared out of his mind.


INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DUSK

Crawford stands by the bed, glancing over a set of forms on a metal clipboard.

DR. LUNT, a senior neurologist, and a HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATOR wait. The machines hiss and click, keeping Jennifer alive.

Crawford signs the forms, expressionless.


EXT. COURTHOUSE - THE SAME TIME

Willy’s walking alongside Judge Robinson, as they leave the building. The Judge is wearing his "civilian clothes."

JUDGE ROBINSON
What do the doctors say?

WILLY
People wake up out of these things.

JUDGE ROBINSON
What did the doctors say, Mr. Slocum?

WILLY
They said...there’s no way to really know. I’m trying to get them to run more tests - but I was there, and I’m telling you.
 
96


JUDGE ROBINSON
I’m sorry. I have no probable cause to issue a court order against Mr. Crawford - and he’s protected agai-

WILLY
WHAT ABOUT HIS WIFE?!	WHAT’S
PROTECTING HER?!

The Judge stops - giving Willy a hard eye: I’m sympathetic, but yelling at me is not a smart approach.

Willy looks at the Judge a second - hapless, frustrated, scared - then nods and shakes his head and turns away - hurrying off through the homeward-bound crowds.

The Judge watches him go.	Grimaces.


INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - KITCHEN - THAT EVENING

Crawford is carefully preparing an elegant, solitary meal.
Music plays on his state-of-the-art sound system.

He stops, noticing a pair of Jennifer’s reading glasses, folded up by a note-pad and pen next to the telephone. He picks them up. Stylish, feminine.

He goes to the trash, steps on the pedal to flip open the lid, and drops the glasses in.

Goes back to cooking.


INT. LOBRUTO HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT

Lobruto - at the dinner table with his family - looks up, surprised, as the doorbell rings. He excuses himself -

-	goes to open the door. Willy’s outside: apologetic but urgent, near the end of his rope.

WILLY
I’m sorry - but nobody else seems to give a damn that sooner or later this guy is gonna finish what he started.

Beat.

LOBRUTO
Have you been home at all today,
Willy?
 
97


Willy looks down at himself: he’s unshaven, in the same rumpled clothes he wore to court yesterday. Exasperated:

WILLY
No - I’ve been trying to get some-

LOBRUTO
There’s a court order out against you.

WILLY
What?

LOBRUTO
A restraining order.
(Beat)

You were at the hospital? Talking to her doctors?

Willy nods. Lobruto looks out at the confused, frantic young man - truly sorry that he can’t help Willy fight his way back toward doing some good in this mess.

LOBRUTO
Crawford hired a lawyer this time.
They saw Judge Gorman this afternoon.

WILLY
Against me.

LOBRUTO
You need to stay away from him, and his wife, and the hospital. He can have you arrested if you don’t.
(Beat)
I’m sorry.
(beat)

I can’t help you. I told you how it would go.

Willy stares a second, slowly understanding his situation.

WILLY
Can you do anything for her?

Beat.

LOBRUTO
I don’t see how.

Willy grimaces.	But nods.	Turns away.
 
98


EXT. LOBRUTO HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

We move with Willy out to the quiet street. The windows of the houses he passes seem warm and safe - and very far away.

Behind him, Lobruto watches from his lighted doorway.

Willy walks, shaken, determined, into the night.


INT. HOSPITAL - I.C.U. - THE NEXT MORNING

A NURSE checks Jennifer Crawford’s vital signs. She then begins to gently wash Jennifer’s face, where it’s not taped or bandaged.

The monitor beeps, the ventilator hisses.


INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - THE SAME TIME

Crawford knots his necktie, studying himself in the mirror.
Expressionless.


EXT. GARDNER HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - SOON AFTER

Judge Gardner pulls his car out to the street -

-	swerving hastily, as Willy’s car skids alongside and forces him to the curb, horn honking.

Willy pulls to a stop, blocking Gardner’s way, and gets out of the car - holding up both palms: just wait.


INT. HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR - LATER THAT MORNING

Dr. Lunt takes a chart from the I.C.U. Nurses’ Station.

DR. LUNT
Has Mrs. Crawford been prepared?


INT. CRAWFORD’S CAR - SOON AFTER

Crawford drives, wearing a dark suit, sunglasses.	Calm.
 
99


INT. JUDGE GARDNER’S CHAMBERS - SAME TIME

Willy watches GARDNER’S SECRETARY bring in a document, fresh off the laser-printer. As Gardner signs:

WILLY
Can I use your fax machine?

GARDNER
These have to be served in person.


INT. PARKING STRUCTURE - DOWNTOWN L.A. - CONTINUOUS

Willy brakes as he drives around a corner and sees a DRIVER wrangling with the BOOTH GUY. He grimaces, looks around -

- backs up, tires squealing, heading for another exit.


INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Dr. Lunt stands by Jennifer’s bed, supervising the Nurse and an Orderly as they prepare her.


INT. HOSPITAL - LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

Crawford walks in, goes toward the elevators.


INT. WILLY’S CAR - INTERSECTION - CONTINUOUS

He floors it, racing under a light going red - narrowly misses getting broad-sided.


INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Dr. Lunt looks up from making notes on Jennifer’s chart, as Crawford enters the room.


EXT. EMERGENCY ROOM ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

Willy pulls into a NO PARKING zone and jumps out, papers in hand - tossing the keys to an ORDERLY smoking a cigarette -

WILLY
Move it if you need to!

- running through the automatic doors.
 
100


INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Standing beside Dr. Lunt, Crawford watches, expressionless -

-	as the Nurse and the Orderly work, efficient and silent, disconnecting the oxygen tubes, unplugging the monitor -


INT. HOSPITAL LOBBY - SOON AFTER

Willy dodges people, coming to the elevators - which open.

Too crowded.


INT. HOSPITAL STAIRWAY - SOON AFTER

Willy gasps a little as he hurries up the stairs -


INT. HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR - SOON AFTER

- comes out of the fire stairs, hurrying toward I.C.U. -


INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

-	and into Jennifer’s room, where he stops. Shocked. The bed is being stripped, the equipment rolled out. Willy stares, breathless, overwhelmed.

NURSE
You just missed her.

WILLY
What?

NURSE
She just went on up.

Willy struggles to control his emotions.	Looks down.

WILLY
How long ago...did she die?

NURSE
What?
(Beat)
The roof.
(Beat)
(MORE)
 
101


NURSE (cont’d) Medevac transfer. Out to a long-term care facility up in Santa Barbara. They just left, you can probably still catch ’em.

Willy tries to understand her.	With growing horror.

WILLY
He’s - moving her by helicopter?

NURSE
Nothing but the best.

We hear the surge of a jet engine -

- as Willy runs out of the room.


EXT. HOSPITAL ROOF - HELIPAD - LATER

A Sikorsky S-76 Medevac chopper is preparing to take off, very loud and windy.

Through the open doorway and the thick windows, we can glimpse Crawford sitting beside Jennifer, who is strapped on to a gurney. She’s connected to life-support equipment.

The MED TECH is outside, checking a few last supplies and giving Crawford a moment alone with his wife.

Crawford moves. He may be whispering to her. Or adjusting her pillow. Hard to tell.

As he climbs out of the chopper -

-	he sees Willy across the roof, arguing with Dr. Lunt, who is skimming the court documents, shaking his head.

Crawford, curious, walks toward the two men.


EXT. HOSPITAL ROOF HELIPAD - WILLY - THE SAME TIME

Dr. Lunt hands Crawford the court order. As Crawford reads them, Lunt and Willy shout over the helicopter engine:

DR. LUNT
This orders him not to take her off life support! He’s not! We can’t stop the man from -

WILLY
Then just hold it - for a couple of hours! Have it inspected!
 
102


DR. LUNT
You’re talking about a phenomenally expensive delay, Mr. Slocum - when the man has every right to move his wife!

WILLY
She’s not gonna get there!

He looks at Crawford: reading - amused, thoughtful.

WILLY
This man is a mechanical engineer with expertise in air crashes! He has access to airfields and he knows exactly how to make it look like an accident! You know what he did! You know why she’s like this!

Lunt hesitates, feeling a tiny edge of doubt.

Crawford checks his watch.	Looks into Willy’s eyes -

-	then gestures for Willy to join him, and turns back to walk across the pad to the helicopter. Climbs in.

Willy stares, stunned.

Lunt looks at him: case closed. The rotors whirl faster, engine noise rising to a scream.

From the open chopper doorway, Crawford looks at Willy again and gestures for him to get on.

Willy doesn’t know how to react. Slowly, he starts to walk toward the helicopter.


INT. HELICOPTER - CONTINUOUS

Willy bends, coming to the door - wind-whipped, flinching.
Crawford holds out a hand to help him in.

Willy doesn’t move.	The PILOT glances back.

Crawford’s eyes are locked with Willy’s.
 

Willy stares at Crawford, scared.
from the crude, plain challenge.
counting on.
 


But unable to back down Which Crawford is clearly

 

Angry, at himself, Willy climbs in without taking Crawford’s hand. As he nervously figures out how to buckle himself in -
 
103


-	the Med Tech secures the door, the Pilot turns to face front - and they lift off.


EXT. ABOVE LOS ANGELES - SOON AFTER

Looking directly down at the Sikorsky as it glides over a picturesque mapscape of streets and freeways, gray and terra-cotta rooftops, blue kidneys and rectangles of pool.


INT. HELICOPTER - SAME TIME

Willy watches Crawford, who stares back at him.	Calm.

Glances uneasily at the Pilot, bug-headed in sun-goggles and headphones. Flying them, calm.

The Med Tech, adjusting Jennifer’s portable ventilator.
Calm.


EXT. ABOVE LOS ANGELES - SOON AFTER

The Sikorsky glides over cross-hatched parking lots, a pale swath of beach -

- and the white foaming edge of the Pacific.


INT. HELICOPTER - CONTINUOUS

Willy looks up from the view.	Scared.	Yells to the Pilot.

WILLY
Why are we going out over the ocean?

PILOT
Less traffic.

Willy looks at Crawford.


EXT. ABOVE THE OCEAN - SOON AFTER

Deep dark vast blue.	The Sikorsky flies over.	Small.


INT. HELICOPTER - SOON AFTER

Willy stares into Crawford’s eyes.
 
104


Then he looks around at the vibrating metal box carrying him hundreds of feet above the earth. The sunlight glare in the scratched windows. The blur of the rotors against the empty sky. The edges of the door frame. The rivets in the roof.

Crawford’s eyes.	Amused.

Willy unbuckles his seat-belt, lurches toward the Pilot -

WILLY
We have to turn back!

PILOT
Get in your seat!

WILLY
He’s doing something - we have to turn back!

PILOT
Who’s doing something?

Willy points to Crawford, who’s just sitting there -

WILLY
He is!	You have to get us DOWN!

PILOT
Get back in your goddamn seat!

CRAWFORD
Willy, I’m not doing anything.
Everyone can see that.

WILLY
I’m TELLING you, we have to TURN BACK!
He’s DOING SOMETH-

An alarm begins to shriek - on the ventilator.

Everyone turns as the Med Tech hastily kneels next to it -

WILLY
What’s happening?!

MED TECH
I don’t know - I’m - there’s a -
malfunction -

-	Willy whips around to look at Crawford, with fury in his glare: oh, you bastard.

Crawford almost smiles.
 
105


The Med Tech is flipping switches, checking wires -

MED TECH
I can’t do anything with this, up here.

The Pilot turns - steeply, Willy falling over, the Med Tech’s supplies spilling - as the Med Tech hastily removes Jennifer’s breathing tube and prepares to begin C.P.R. -

CRAWFORD
She’s D.N.R.

The Med Tech looks up - startled.	Confused.

WILLY
What is it?

CRAWFORD
Check.

Willy watches, wide-eyed, as the Med Tech grabs up his paperwork, searching it -

WILLY
What?

The Med Tech looks up at Willy, scared.

MED TECH
She’s Do Not Resuscitate.

Willy turns on Crawford.	He shrugs.

CRAWFORD
It’s in her living will.

The Med Tech looks at Willy, paralyzed.

MED TECH
She’s D.N.R.	She signed it.

WILLY
There’s a restraining order - she’s protected - I’m authorizing you to do it!

The Med Tech turns to Crawford, uncertain -

CRAWFORD
No extraordinary measures.
(Turns to Willy)
Unless your court order specifies
(MORE)
 
106


CRAWFORD (cont’d)
contravening her living will.	But I
don’t think it would.	I think you got
one that forbids me from disconn-

Willy throws himself at Crawford - attacking him, as the Med Tech grabs him, drags him back -

PILOT
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON BACK THERE?!

-	the Med Tech holding Willy down on the floor by Jennifer’s stretcher - Willy struggles furiously -

WILLY
Wait!	WAIT - LOOK!

Willy is pointing at Jennifer - shocked -

-	as the Med Tech lets him up and they kneel by her, the Med Tech taking her pulse - Willy, staring down at her, intent:

She’s breathing.

WILLY
Yes.	Yes.

Willy whirls around to Crawford.	Who’s frowning.

WILLY
You messed up. With all your plans and games.

Willy turns back to Jennifer. Delicately strokes the side of her face. Her eyes flutter open -

WILLY
Shhhh.	It’s okay.	It’s all right.

-	she stares into Willy’s eyes. He takes her hand. Silent awe in her eyes. Yearning. Fear.

WILLY
You’re gonna be okay?

She squeezes his hand.	Very weakly.

Crawford is looking daggers: die, bitch.

Jennifer’s eyes - fixed on Willy - roll back.	She fights it.

WILLY
Jennifer?	Hang on.

Something sad in her wordless gaze.	As it starts to fade.
 
107


WILLY
Jennifer?!	JENNIFER?!

She’s slipping. Her eyes gone empty. Her hand becoming lifeless in his.

WILLY
No.	Come on, Jennifer.	Fight back.

Tears well up in Willy’s eyes, but he struggles against them - feeling Crawford’s gaze, refusing him the satisfaction.

WILLY
Don’t let go.

But she’s gone. He stares down. Mourning her. Letting his grief slowly burn into rage. He gently reaches up and closes her eyes.

Then he looks up at Crawford, who smiles sympathetically.

CRAWFORD
You pushed it, Willy. We didn’t have to be here.
(Beat)
But now you’re my witness. You saw: I didn’t touch anything, I didn’t do anything. The machine went down.

Anybody asks - you’ll have to tell them. What you saw.
(Beat)
That’s really kind of perfect, isn’t it?

Willy stares into his eyes. Cold. Then he looks away. Out the window, into the sun-glare.

SLOW DISSOLVE TO:


INT. WILLY’S APARTMENT - A COUPLE OF DAYS LATER

The garage door is open, letting in daylight. We can see the alley especially well, because there are only empty hangers on the clothes-bar, and the cinderblock shelves have been taken apart, stacked on the floor.

Willy is packing.	He’s wearing jeans, an old t-shirt.

He carries a heavy pile of legal textbooks out to the trash bins, throws them away.
 
108


As he turns to go back in - he sees Lobruto coming along the alley, wearing a suit. Surprised, waits.

LOBRUTO
You’re not answering your phone.

Beat.

WILLY
That’s kind of an answer in itself, isn’t it?

Willy heads back in, starts to pack again.

LOBRUTO
Where are you headed?

WILLY
Haven’t decided yet. Just someplace else.

Lobruto nods.	Willy packs.

LOBRUTO
I shouldn’t have let it get so far out of control.
(Beat)
We all lose, Willy.

WILLY
Yep.

LOBRUTO
We just have to live with that, and keep fighting the good fight.

WILLY
That’s not what I was doing.

LOBRUTO
You belong in a courtroom.

Willy packs, thinking about that.	Shakes his head.

WILLY
I need to - get to know myself better.

LOBRUTO
You’re a good lawyer. All this may have even made you a better lawyer. Don’t waste it.

Willy turns on him - angry, confused, bitter:
 
109


WILLY
I didn’t just lose a case! I let a man get away with murder.

Lobruto nods. Respecting his pain. Shrugs, accepts the decision, with regret.

Willy nods his thanks, and turns back to packing.

Lobruto starts to leave.	But from the alley door:

LOBRUTO
If it makes you feel any better - technically, you let a man get away with attempted murder.

Willy doesn’t respond.	Keeps packing.

Lobruto goes out.

After a moment, Willy stops. Looking up. Something turning over in his mind.


EXT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

Lobruto is walking toward his car when Willy steps out of the garage and calls after him:

WILLY
His wife is dead!

Lobruto turns.	Uncertain what Willy is getting at.

WILLY
We can still get him. We can take him back to court.

LOBRUTO
(Gently)
Willy...

Willy comes toward him - excited, insistent:

WILLY
Double jeopardy doesn’t apply! We bring a new charge - of homicide.

LOBRUTO
Willy - what happened to you, on the
helicopter - we don’t even know if we
could prove -
 
110


WILLY
No: he shot her and she died. The fact that it took time - the fact that he went to trial in between, just for shooting her - doesn’t matter. He fired a gun and caused her death, and that’s murder.
(Beat)
If he can twist the law around - then so can we.

Lobruto thinks it out.	Wary.

LOBRUTO
A second indictment on the same
incident?

WILLY
A man burns down a house; we charge him with arson. There were people sleeping upstairs - and after weeks in the hospital, they die. We’d charge him with murder. Right?

Lobruto nods. On the fence, but seeing it now. Impressed with the young man’s fervor, and his logic.

But he shakes his head.

LOBRUTO
All your evidence is still toxic. The confession, the arrest - it’s all still inadmissible.

Willy grimaces.	Looks down.	Thinking, intense.

LOBRUTO
I’m sorry, Willy. It was a good idea, but -

WILLY
I’ll get something new.

LOBRUTO
How?

Willy looks up at him.	Calm now.

WILLY
You don’t want to know.

LOBRUTO
Willy, you can’t -
 
111


WILLY
I don’t work for you.
(Beat)
Right?

Beat. Lobruto sighs, as Willy nods and turns to start back to the garage. With work to do.

LOBRUTO
Don’t do anything crazy.

WILLY
What else have we got left?

Willy disappears inside.


INT. S.I.D. LAB - LATER

End of the day. Marchand pulls on his coat, shuts down his computer. He turns to go -

- Willy is standing in his doorway.

WILLY
I need a favor.


INT. POLICE EVIDENCE WAREHOUSE - SOON AFTER

Willy follows an EVIDENCE CLERK along an aisle between floor-to-ceiling steel shelves of boxes marked with case numbers.

CRAWFORD
These are from that thing at the
courthouse, right?

WILLY
Uh-huh.

The Clerk stops, checking a number against a slip of paper in his hand - pulls down a box for Willy.


INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - THAT NIGHT

Crawford is building a new Rube Goldberg device, tools and parts laid out precisely on a table.

Eyes enlarged by the glasses, he silently connects two tiny pieces of metal -
 
112


-	when a French door suddenly implodes, a metal lawn chair hurled in from the backyard smashing through it.

Crawford stands, taking off the glasses -

-	as Willy walks in over the broken glass, carrying Nunally’s gun.

CRAWFORD
Very dramatic.

Willy crosses the room to the alarm panel on the wall.

WILLY
You ain’t seen nothin’ yet.

He presses the POLICE emergency button, then turns to Crawford.

WILLY
I want the gun.

CRAWFORD
Why?	You’ve already got one.

WILLY
I want the gun you shot your wife with. Now.

Crawford doesn’t move.

Willy raises his gun, points it at Crawford’s face.

WILLY
One way or another, I’m going to see to it you receive justice tonight.

Crawford studies Willy.

CRAWFORD
You’re serious, aren’t you.

WILLY
Oh, yes.

CRAWFORD
(A smile dawning)
Willy.	You got religion, didn’t you?!
You care.	That’s...priceless.

He laughs.	Willy keeps the gun aimed at him.
 
113


CRAWFORD
No, it’s very sweet.	Really.

WILLY
Gonna be a whole lot less funny in about a minute.

Crawford nods.	Considering the game.	Unruffled.

CRAWFORD
Getting it like this: is that going to hold up in court?

WILLY
I don’t work for the D.A. any more. I’m just a guy who broke into your house. When the police arrest me - they’ll inventory anything in my possession. If that happens to be crucial evidence in another case, well: some prosecutor just got lucky.

Silence. Crawford studies Willy’s eyes, over the muzzle of the gun between them.

CRAWFORD
It takes a very special kind of person to look right into someone’s eyes and pull the trigger. It takes a unique kind of strength.

WILLY
I guess you’d know that.

CRAWFORD
Yes.	I would.

Willy cocks the gun.

Crawford shakes his head.	Eyes on Willy.

CRAWFORD
I don’t think so.

Willy doesn’t lower the gun. But he doesn’t pull the trigger, either.

WILLY
You don’t know me.

CRAWFORD
No?
 
114


Beat.	Crawford smiles slightly.

CRAWFORD
Then I’m in for a - rude awakening.

Willy glares over the gun.	Crawford shrugs.

CRAWFORD
Tick-tock.

Willy’s angry.	Frustrated.	Trapped.

His bluff called.	Refusing to back down.

CRAWFORD
Where did you even get yourself a gun?

WILLY
(Bitter)
It’s Nunally’s.

Crawford is thrown by this - but conceals it well.

CRAWFORD
Nunally’s.	Really.

Willy grimaces, over the gun still aimed at Crawford’s face.

WILLY
Yeah.	Really.

He has backed himself into a corner, and he’s getting scared. Because all of a sudden the threat he came to fake Crawford out with -

- is starting to seem like his only way out.

Even Crawford sees it. In Willy’s eyes. The uncertain edge of the idea. He could just do it. End the game. Blow Crawford’s brains all over the wall.

WILLY
There I was, with a perfectly good weapon just sitting in the evidence warehouse.

It would be so easy. With his life already a shambles. With everything already lost. At least he would have this.

CRAWFORD
Willy.	Put it down.
 
115


WILLY
I thought you might appreciate the
...irony.

Willy’s finger tightens on the trigger.

CRAWFORD
Willy.	Think.

And Willy does.	Hesitating.

Distracted, by a thought.

Lowering the gun slightly, looking at it - remembering:


INT. S.I.D. LAB - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

Marchand, on the phone - holding the gun Crawford surrendered, in its plastic EVIDENCE bag:

WILLY (V.O.)
"A perfectly good...Heckler and Koch nine-millimeter."


INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - (RESUME)

Crawford is getting edgy, watching Willy study Nunally’s gun:

CRAWFORD
The police will be here very soon.

WILLY
The exact same type of gun you bought your wife, a month before.

He looks up at Crawford.	Getting it.


INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - (FLASHBACK)

Nunally setting down his pistol on the chair - as Crawford, across the room, sets down his on the table.


INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - (RESUME)

CRAWFORD
If they see you with a gun in your hand - they’re not likely to ask a lot of questions.
 
116


WILLY
That’s why you went to the hotel.


INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - DAY (FLASHBACK)

Surveillance-cam view: Crawford lets himself into the room -

WILLY (V.O.)
That’s why you went into the room.


INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY (FLASHBACK)

Crawford quietly closes the door behind him. Stands, taking it all in -


INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - (RESUME)

Willy looks at Crawford.	Stunned.

WILLY
You took his gun.


INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY (FLASHBACK)

Crawford checks the dresser drawers, the night-table - finds Nunally’s badge, holster and gun.

WILLY (V.O.)
And you left him yours.

Crawford replaces Nunally’s gun with his own matching pistol, which was tucked into the back of his belt.


INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - (RESUME)

Beat.	Crawford shrugs - arrogant:

CRAWFORD
I gave it back.

WILLY
Yes you did.


INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - (FLASHBACKS - VERY QUICK)
 

Crawford fires at Jennifer - Crawford shoots at the transom -
 
117


WILLY (V.O.)
After you’d used it.

Crawford holds out the gun, to Nunally: making the offer -

WILLY (V.O.)
Then you told Nunally you’d put it down - if he put down his.

Nunally setting down his pistol on the chair, as Crawford, across the room, sets down his on the table.


INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - (RESUME)

Willy turns, looking into the alcove:

WILLY
That’s why you moved her back there -


INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - (FLASHBACK)

Nunally rushes past Crawford to kneel by Jennifer - shocked, frantic -

CRAWFORD (V.O.)
The truth is I could have done it right in front of the man and he wouldn’t have noticed.

- ignoring Crawford behind him.


INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - (RESUME)

CRAWFORD
He had...other things on his mind.


INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

Nunally’s calling for help on the walkie-talkie, desperately starting C.P.R. -

-	as behind him, Crawford picks up the murder weapon, (Nunally’s gun) from the table -
 

-	and walks over to the chair where Nunally left Crawford’s gun (from his holster).
 
118


WILLY (V.O.)
And all you had to do was switch the
guns back - in the commotion -

Crawford picks up his gun and sets the murder weapon on the chair in its place.

WILLY (V.O.)
- and then wait -

He then comes back to put his gun on the table, where it will be mistaken for the murder weapon. Straightens, done.


INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT (FLASHBACKS)

Nunally grabs up the murder weapon from the chair, upset, distracted - puts it in his holster -

WILLY (V.O.)
-	until Nunally walked the murder weapon right out of the house.

A Detective drops Jennifer’s gun into an evidence bag -

- as Nunally walks out.


INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - (RESUME)

Willy stares at Crawford.	In real wonder.

WILLY
Brilliant.

CRAWFORD
You know, this is really kind of fun. It’s like showing some caveman a cigarette lighter.

Willy looks down at the gun in his hand.	Thoughtful.

WILLY
This caveman’s gonna put you in prison for the rest of your life.

CRAWFORD
It’s still not evidence, Willy.
There’s no prints left by now.
Nothing ties that gun to me.

Willy smiles, slow...	Enjoying himself, at last.
 
119


WILLY
No. That would be true. Except for all those eggs.

CRAWFORD
Those what?

Willy nods to himself, going to the wooden bowl of ball-bearings - selecting one, carrying it to the Rube Goldberg machine:

WILLY
With all those little cracks and weak places. Like Nunally. Shooting himself, right there in the courthouse. I didn’t think he was going to do that. Did you?

CRAWFORD
(Wary)
No.

Studying the complex device, toying with Crawford:

WILLY
I mean, we all knew he was going to fall apart sooner or later. That was part of your plan, right? Like a bank shot, on a pool table: you kill your wife - and destroy her lover. With one bullet.
(Turns)
Well: four bullets, actually.	Right?

Crawford frowns.	Trying to see what Willy’s getting at.

WILLY
First bullet goes into your wife.

INTERCUT QUICK FLASHBACKS:

Crawford fires at Jennifer -

WILLY (V.O.)
Then three more out the front of the house, to get some attention.

- and fires three times at the transom.

WILLY
Then while you’re waiting for the show to begin - you have to reload Nunally’s gun.
 
120


Crawford pushes new bullets into the clip -

WILLY (V.O.)
I mean, you don’t want him wondering where the hell four bullets went, considering he never fired his gun that night.

- and slides the clip back into the gun, pleased.

Willy nods, thinking it out.	Sure of himself.

He sets the ball-bearing into the slot at the top of the machine -

WILLY
And I’m betting you didn’t worry about fingerprints.

Crawford reacts.

CLOSE: Crawford’s fingers, putting the bullets in the clip.

Willy lets the ball go - watching it begin rolling down the ornate tracks.

WILLY
I mean, why would you? Nobody’s going to be looking at his gun.

The ball tumbles and clatters - flipping and clicking through the ingenious, precise, heartless machinery -

WILLY
And sooner or later, life goes on, those four incriminating bullets would get used, and be gone forever.

- and Crawford is recognizing, slowly, his one mistake.

The gun in Nunally’s limp dead fingers, glimpsed on the marble courthouse floor, through the crowd.

WILLY (V.O.)
Except Nunally only fired one of those bullets. Into himself.

Willy turns from the machine -

- which continues clattering and working, beside him.
 
121


WILLY
Which means there are still three left with your fingerprints on them - Tom. In this clip.

He holds the gun up.	Savoring Crawford’s growing fear.

They can hear a car rolling up the driveway. Red and blue lights sweep the frosted glass by the front door.

WILLY
Everybody has a weak spot, right?
Some place they break.

Without looking, Willy gently pushes the machine, moving it a fraction of an inch on the floor -

-	as the ball catapults out - sailing across the living room in a perfect, graceful arc -

-	that misses the bowl.

Outside, the police car doors open and then slam.

Crawford, going pale, watches the metal ball roll off the coffee-table and across the floor toward him.

Crawford doesn’t move.	Trying to focus.	His mind working.

The ball comes to rest against Crawford’s shoe.

The doorbell rings.

Crawford looks up.	Meeting Willy’s eyes.

Smiling slightly, Willy tucks Nunally’s gun into his belt and puts his hands in the air.

And gives Crawford a wink.

Crawford is staring at Willy, frozen - panic and hatred and fear curdling in his eyes -

-	as behind him, the police begin pounding on the front door.
