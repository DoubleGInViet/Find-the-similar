FADE IN:

NEON SIGN - THE PRINCE MOTEL - NIGHT

The N and the E are not working. So it reads the PRICE
motel.
ROOMS TO RENT BY DAY, WEEK, MONTH. KITCHENETTES. The
Prince
Motel has passed its prime. A few beat up cars are
parked
outside rooms. We CRANE DOWN to ROOM SEVEN. Curtains
closed,
but someone is holding it open a crack, looking out. We

PUSH
in CLOSE TO THE WINDOW and the EYE looking over the
parking
lot. Then the curtain closes.

INT. ROOM SEVEN - PRINCE MOTEL - NIGHT

Peeling flowered wallpaper, ultra-cheap furniture. The
man
moving away from the window is RODRIGUEZ. He is
slender,
sports a thin mustache, hair slicked straight back.

He's in
his late thirties. Slightly nervous.

Another man sits on the couch, looking at a magazine.
He is
forty, solidly built. His name is FRANK DIVINCI.

DIVINCI

Says here they got slips in Honolulu.
325 a month. Utilities included.
 
That's not bad.

Rodriguez sits down.

DIVINCI

But I gotta get at least a forty footer. It'll handle rough water better and I'll need the room if I'm gonna live on it.

Rodriguez stands up, moves back to the window. Divinci
looks
up.

RODRIGUEZ

I don't know how you do it.

DIVINCI

What?

RODRIGUEZ

How you can think about Hawaii now?

DIVINCI

My heart's in Hawaii.

RODRIGUEZ

You never been there. How can your
heart be there.

DIVINCI

You're tellin' me there's no place
you'd rather be other than here?

RODRIGUEZ

No, I'm saying I just don't know how you can think about Hawaii right now.

DIVINCI

If I was in Hawaii right now, I wouldn't be thinking about here. See the difference?

RODRIGUEZ

No.

DIVINCI

Look, I'm not in Hawaii, I'm here. But I don't want to be here, I want to be in Hawaii. I can't be in Hawaii, therefore I think about it so as to
 
not get depressed about being here.

RODRIGUEZ

But I'm here, I know I'm here, I
don't like being here, but I can't

be anyplace else because I look around and I see all this shit. How do you get around that?! That's what I'm asking.

DIVINCI

Focus.

RODRIGUEZ

Focus.

Divinci nods. Rodriguez looks at his watch.

RODRIGUEZ

It's time. No more Hawaii, okay?
Focus on this.

DIVINCI
(smiles)
Aloha.

Rodriguez shakes his head, exasperated, and exits.

RODRIGUEZ
(to himself)
Aloha my ass.


CUT TO:

EXT. DARK STREET - NIGHT

Poor side of town. A few old cars parked on the street.
Some
buildings vacant. A LATE MODEL WHITE CADILLAC cruises
past.
We HEAR LOUD RAP MUSIC.

INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT

LIONEL HUDD drives. Hudd is thirty. African American.
The
MUSIC is loud. His clothes lean to African roots. A
WOMAN
sits next to the passenger window. Her name is CYNTHIA
WEBB.
 
Cynthia is thirty-five, dressed in short provocative

skirt,
tight top. A little too much make-up. She's lead a hard
life.

She glances at Hudd. Hudd glances at her, looks down at
her
skirt hiked up on her leg.

CYNTHIA
Left at the corner.

Hudd's eyes linger on her thighs for a moment, then he
turns
his attention back to driving, tapping along with the

heavy
bass.

EXT. PRINCE MOTEL - NIGHT

The Cadillac pulls into the parking lot. Parks in front
of
room SEVEN. Hudd gets out, looks around. Cynthia gets
out,
leads him to SEVEN. Knocks.

The curtains pull back. Divinci looks at Hudd and
Cynthia.
She nods to him. The door unlocks and opens.

Cynthia enters. Hudd looks around again. Then follows.

INT. MOTEL ROOM SEVEN - NIGHT

Divinci waits at the door. He and Hudd eye each other
as

Hudd enters the room. Divinci looks out, making sure no
one
has followed, then shuts the door.

DIVINCI
Hope you don't mind me checkin' you
for weapons.

HUDD

Hell yes I mind.

Divinci hesitates. This could break the deal.

HUDD

I just don't want no man handlin'
me.
 

Hudd looks at Cynthia. The suggestion is taken.

DIVINCI
Okay. Check him.

Hudd spreads his legs, lifts his arms. Cynthia would
rather
not have the job, but there's no choice.

HUDD

Lotta good hidin' places on this
body. Check good.

Cynthia runs her hands over Hudd, checking pockets,

pants,
sleeves. Finally coming to his crotch. Hudd smiles.

HUDD

Careful. It's loaded.

Cynthia has heard it all before. She's not squeamish in
the
least and she gives him a good going over.

CYNTHIA

He's got nothin'.

She smiles back at Hudd. Then moves away, sits on the
couch

and seductively crosses her legs.

Divinci, satisfied, pulls a PLASTIC BAG packed tight
with
COCAINE out of his pocket, tosses it to Hudd.

Hudd sits on the couch, opens the bag, sticks his
finger in
and tastes the contents. But never takes his eyes off
Divinci.

HUDD

Not bad, not bad. Any more where
this came from?

DIVINCI

Maybe.

HUDD

Then maybe we talk again.

DIVINCI
 
Maybe.

Hudd stands, unzips his pants. Reaches in to grab his
cock,
but instead, pulls out a stack of MONEY. Inch thick.

HUDD

Told you there was a lotta good hidin' places on this body.

Hudd hands the money to Divinci and pockets the plastic
bag.
Then crosses to the door. Glances back at Cynthia.

HUDD

Bet you gotta lotta nice hidin'
places, too.

Then Hudd smiles and exits.

EXT. PRINCE MOTEL - NIGHT

Hudd gets into his Cadillac, pulls out of the motel
parking
lot.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Deserted. No one on the street this late. Several of
the

buildings are boarded up.

INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT

Hudd drives. No music this time. His attitude has
changed.
More serious. LIGHTS in the REAR VIEW MIRROR. Coming up
fast.
Hudd watches as the car pulls around to pass.

He glances at the CAR as it pulls past him, but all we
SEE

is the FLASH OF A BLAST FROM A GUN. Front WINDOW
EXPLODING.

THE CADILLAC

swerves into a parked car. The OTHER CAR -- a BUICK
REGAL --
screeches to a stop next to it. ONE MAN gets out.
Moving
 
quickly to the Cadillac. It's dark, difficult to see.

He
carries a SMITH AND WESSON .44. Opens the door. He's
wearing
PLASTIC GLOVES.

Hudd is dead, slumped against the passenger door. The
man

reaches in, turns off the engine, grabs the plastic bag
of
cocaine. And now we see it's Divinci.

INT. BUICK REGAL - NIGHT

Rodriguez is the driver. Anxious. Engine running.

RODRIGUEZ

Come on! Hurry up!

Divinci dashes back to the Buick, hops in. Rodriguez
floors
it.

THE BUICK

tears off down the dark street.


CUT TO:

EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Not a great part of the city. Apartment buildings line
both

sides of the street. An alley runs between two of the buildings. A TAXI pulls up in front. HEADLIGHTS SHINING

on a
MAN passed out in the street.

Cynthia exits the taxi. The taxi pulls away. She
glances at
the man passed out in the street.

His clothes are ragged. He's filthy. His face covered
in
beard and greasy dirty hair. Hard to tell how old he
is.
Maybe forty. Maybe eighty. Who knows? His hand clutches
a
bottle in a bag.

CYNTHIA
 

Hey, Joe, wake up. Get outa the street before you get run over. Joe, wake up!


She nudges him with her foot. The man groans, rolls
back.
Dead drunk.

CYNTHIA

You're in the street, Joe. Get outa
the street.

The man, JOE, is silent for a moment, then he starts to
crawl --
toward the middle of the street.

CYNTHIA

Other way, Joe.

Joe turns his crawl toward the curb. Cynthia watches
him for
a moment. He is truly pathetic.

CYNTHIA

Forget it, Joe. Maybe you're better off right there. I don't think you'd even feel it.

Cynthia enters the building next to the alley.


CUT TO:

CYNTHIA - INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

asleep. The room is dark. We HEAR a door open and
close.
Cynthia wakes.

CYNTHIA

Who is it?

Divinci crosses to the bed.

DIVINCI

Got your money.

CYNTHIA
Put it on the table.

She closes her eyes, trying to go back to sleep.
 
DIVINCI

Tired?

CYNTHIA
Yes.

DIVINCI

I'm not.

CYNTHIA
Take a sleeping pill. There's some
in my purse.

DIVINCI

You want your money?

Cynthia's eyes open and she looks up at Divinci. He's
smiling,
holding up FIVE ONE HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS.

CYNTHIA

I already worked for that.

Divinci unzips his pants.

DIVINCI

This is a bonus.

CYNTHIA
For who?

Divinci smiles. Cynthia snatches the money. Divinci
starts
to undress.

DIVINCI

This ain't my fault. This is a failure of our educational system. If you hadn't fallen through the cracks and dropped outa school, you wouldn't be here now.

CYNTHIA

So what's your excuse?

DIVINCI

I'm in love.

Cynthia just stares at him for a long beat. Then she
unbuckles
Divinci's pants.
 

CUT TO:

KEY - INSERTED INTO DOOR LOCK - NIGHT

A door is pushed open. Rodriguez enters his one bedroom apartment. Starts to shut the door when TWO MEN appear

from

the shadows. The first is short, well dressed. His name
is
VIC. The second is large, heavy-set, shaved head. His
name
is CUTLESS SUPREME. Cutless Supreme is not a man to be
messed
with.

VIC

Keepin' some late hours.

Rodriguez looks at Cutless Supreme.

RODRIGUEZ

What the hell you doin'? What're my
neighbors gonna think?

VIC

I apologize. I understand your concerns. But you must understand that, unlike a bank, I cannot rely on a late fee as sufficient encouragement to repay one's debts. I am forced to employ the likes of Mr. Cutless Supreme, whom I might add, contributes significantly to my overhead. I am the real loser here. And I am concerned about your sincerity in repaying the twenty-seven thousand, nine hundred forty-two dollar gambling debt that is one week past due. What can you do to reassure me of your good intentions?

RODRIGUEZ

I can make your life fuckin' miserable that's what I can do.

VIC

Look at me. Do I have a wife and three kids? Do I have a good job at IBM? Am I a handsome guy? No, no and no. I loan money at excessively high interest rates to pricks like you
 

who can't control their urges to lose big money playing cards and then I am forced to stay up all night trying to convince them that I have needs, too. The point of which is, I already have a fuckin' miserable life. So don't threaten me you lousy bag of cat shit.

Rodriguez steps toward Vic, but Cutless Supreme slides
in
between them. Rodriguez isn't going to win this one.

VIC

All I'm askin' is that you be

responsible. Is that unreasonable?

Rodriguez backs off, hesitates as he runs over his
options.
There aren't any. He reaches into his pocket, pulls out
some
of his night's earnings.

RODRIGUEZ

Four thousand is all I got.

VIC

I am proportionally reassured. You
purchased yourself an extension.

Vic takes the money, heads for the street. Rodriguez
watches
Vic walk away. Cutless Supreme watches Rodriguez.

RODRIGUEZ

Cutless Supreme, what kind of fuckin' idiot name is that?

CUTLESS SUPREME

It was the car my daddy stole to take my momma to the hospital, but the cops stopped him and shot him dead in an alley before he could explain. I was born in the back seat.

Rodriguez glares at Cutless Supreme, then he shuts the
door.


CUT TO:

CREDIT SEQUENCE - BLACK AND WHITE MONTAGE
 

CRIME SCENE PHOTOGRAPHS -- Dead drug dealers lying
where
they were shot. Overlapping CLOSE-UPS of EVIDENCE TAGS
and
SHELVING filled with EVIDENCE from hundreds of crime
scenes.
And CLOSE-SHOTS of CRIME SCENES -- chalk outlines --
bullet
shells - bloody foot prints. And finally CRIME SCENE
TAPE.
The BLACK AND WHITE fades back into COLOR --

YELLOW CRIME SCENE TAPE

surrounding the CADILLAC. We PULL BACK, revealing COPS controlling the area. It's early morning. A FEW PEOPLE

have
stopped to watch. But this is not a high traffic area.

ANOTHER CAR pulls up. Unmarked. Two men get out. We
FOLLOW

BEHIND THEM as they approach the Cadillac and PATROLMAN MAHONEY, who knows them.

PATROLMAN MAHONEY

Another day, another body. Where you wanna start?

FIRST MAN

A hit?

PATROLMAN MAHONEY

Looks like. Could be gang related.

And now we SEE THE TWO MEN from the unmarked car. It's
DIVINCI
and RODRIGUEZ. Suit and ties. They act like they own
the
area. And they do.

PATROLMAN MAHONEY

Happened sometime last night, early morning, two, three o'clock. African-American male, looks like in his thirties. But even that's a guess. Half his head is on the upholstery.

RODRIGUEZ

Any witnesses?

PATROLMAN MAHONEY
 
Oh, sure, hundreds.

INT. CADILLAC - DAY

The bloody scene is untouched. Hudd's body is where it
fell,
on the seat. Dried blood everywhere. Divinci looks in.

DIVINCI

Fuckin' Animals.


CUT TO:

INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

EVIDENCE ROOM. Behind a locked fenced in area. A DESK
OFFICER
checks in and out all evidence. He is twenty-eight,
wears

glasses, very clean cut. TWO DETECTIVES are checking in evidence as Divinci walks in.

FIRST DETECTIVE

...three shotgun shells, twelve gauge.

The Desk Officer checks in the evidence.

DESK OFFICER
Three shotgun shells, twelve gauge.

The two detectives wave hellos to Divinci as he
approaches.

SECOND DETECTIVE (SGT. GARDNER)

Heard you got a gang related. Lucky guy, Divinci. You get all the pretty ones.

DIVINCI

One less drug store on the street.

DESK OFFICER

And the world is a safer place.

The Desk Officer buzzes Divinci through the door.
Divinci
crosses to the --

EVIDENCE STORAGE ROOM
 
-- filled with shelves. Stacked with evidence from on-

going
investigations. And the shelves are full of guns,
knives,
bloody gloves, masks, shoes, etc.

Divinci looks around, then removes the PACKAGE OF
COCAINE
and the .44 from his pockets and places them back on
one of
the shelves. CASE NUMBER C-549087. One thing about the
.44
which we can see now -- a BLACK STAIN on the metal of
the
handle.


CUT TO:

INT. HOMICIDE SQUAD ROOM - DAY

Desks, phones, computers, typewriters and HOMICIDE
DETECTIVES.
Some witnesses being interviewed. Rodriguez is on the
phone
at his desk. He's in the middle of an interview as he
fills
out one of the many forms that complicate his life.

RODRIGUEZ

(into phone)

--	a green car... you know what make... Maybe a Ford, uh-huh. You didn't see the license, did you?

Divinci comes back to his desk, next to Rodriguez.
Rodriguez
looks up. Divinci gives him a confident smile and
brushes
his hands together -- clean hands.

RODRIGUEZ

(into phone)
Yeah, no, I understand, it was dark...
Uh-huh.

Divinci sits at his desk. He pulls an ADVERTISEMENT for
a 42

FOOT SPORT FISHING BOAT out of his desk. He holds it up
to
Rodriguez, points to the boat.
 
DIVINCI

Wanna go for a ride?

RODRIGUEZ
(into phone)
You think you could describe the
driver?
(covers phone; to
Divinci)
You bought it?

DIVINCI

As of last night, I've got the down. Just picture me under swayin' palms with a Mai Tai.

We can HEAR someone describing a felon over the phone,
but
Rodriguez isn't listening. He's looking at the boat.

RODRIGUEZ

(into phone)
Uh-huh.
(covers phone)
You're gonna buy it, no shit. When?

DIVINCI

Just a phone call away.

Divinci picks up the phone, starts to dial.

RODRIGUEZ

That's really great, man.

Divinci smiles. Rodriguez suddenly realizes the person
on
the other end of the phone has stopped talking.

RODRIGUEZ

(back to phone)
Uh-huh, okay... how tall was he?

A heavy set man in his fifties approaches -- CAPTAIN HENDERSON.

CAPT. HENDERSON

You got primary on the drug related
this morning on 27th.

DIVINCI

I'm workin' it up now.
 
CAPT. HENDERSON

Who's your second?
(Divinci points at
Rodriguez)
In my office. Both of you.

DIVINCI

Why?

CAPT. HENDERSON
Now.

Captain Henderson doesn't wait for a response. He heads
for
the office -- an inner office of glass and wood.

Divinci looks at Rodriguez, who is suddenly a little
nervous.
We can HEAR the PERSON OVER THE PHONE that he's talking
to,
but he's no longer interested and hangs up on them.

RODRIGUEZ
What the hell --

Divinci motions "keep calm."

INT. CAPTAIN HENDERSON'S OFFICE - DAY

Henderson is hanging up his coat as Divinci and
Rodriguez
enter. They aren't the only ones in the office. RICHARD
SIMMS,
thirty-two, trim, short cut hair, suit, is waiting.

CAPT. HENDERSON

Detectives Divinci and Rodriguez, this is Richard Simms. He's with the D.E.A. He wants to ask you some questions about your case.

DIVINCI

What's the occasion?

SIMMS

You get an i.d. on the victim?

RODRIGUEZ
We're waitin' for prints.

Divinci pulls out his note pad.
 
DIVINCI

Car was registered to --

SIMMS

--	Anchor Imports. 81 El Dorado. Black.

DIVINCI

If you got all this, what d'you want from us?

SIMMS

...The man in the car is Lionel Hudd.

RODRIGUEZ

(a little incensed)
How d'you know that?
(to Henderson)
What's goin' on here?

SIMMS

Hudd was DEA, undercover.

Rodriguez and Divinci take the news like a sledgehammer. On
their frozen expressions we HEAR --

SIMMS (O.S.)

He was workin' a case on syndicate distribution of drugs on the south side. But every dealer we tagged kept getting killed. He finally got a lead on a girl -- Hudd was a friend of mine... I'm gonna nail the sonuvabitch who killed him.

A long beat on Rodriguez and Divinci, then --

DIVINCI

We'll do everything we can to help.


CUT TO:

THE UNMARKED POLICE CAR - EXT. STREET - DAY

screeching around a corner and up a drive into a VACANT
LOT.
The car skids to a stop and Rodriguez gets out of the
driver's
side, slamming the door and storming off. He's out of
his
 
mind.

Divinci gets out quickly, follows him. Rodriguez is so
fired
up and scared he can't stop moving.

RODRIGUEZ
SHIT, FUCK, SHIT, JESUS CHRIST!

DIVINCI
Calm down!

RODRIGUEZ
WE'RE DEAD, WE'RE FUCKING DEAD!

DIVINCI
SHUT UP!

RODRIGUEZ
FUCK, FUCK, FUCK!

Divinci catches Rodriguez, tries to stop him from
flailing
about.

DIVINCI
STOP IT! YOU HEAR ME, RIGHT NOW,
STOP IT!

RODRIGUEZ
GOD, GOD, THIS IS REALLY FUCKIN' OUT
OF CONTROL!

Rodriguez tries to push Divinci away, but Divinci holds
on.
They struggle --

RODRIGUEZ
LET GO OF ME!

-- pushing, shoving, falling to the dirt. Divinci jumps
on

top of him, pulling his pistol and shoving it into
Rodriguez
mouth.

DIVINCI

Shut up and listen to me!

Rodriguez glares up at Divinci.

DIVINCI
 
They could be watchin' us right now

you asshole. So fuckin' shape up!
You got it?!
(nothing from Rodriguez)
I want you to nod!

It takes Rodriguez a moment, but he nods. Divinci pulls
his
gun out of Rodriguez' mouth, gets off him and holsters
his
pistol. Rodriguez is scared to death, not of Divinci,
of the
mess they're in. He just lies in the dirt.

DIVINCI

Get the fuck up!

Rodriguez starts to get to his feet. Divinci grabs him,
yanks
him up. Pushes him to the car.

DIVINCI

Get in the car!

They move back to the car. Rodriguez gets back into the driver's seat. Divinci moves around to the passenger

side.
Gets in, slams the door shut.

INT. UNMARKED CAR - DAY

They sit silently in the car for a moment in the middle
of
the vacant lot. Breathing hard. Dirty. After a beat --

DIVINCI

There's no fuckin' reason to panic.

Rodriguez turns slowly and looks at Divinci
incredulously.

RODRIGUEZ

No fuckin' reason to panic? Did you
say no fuckin' reason to panic!

DIVINCI

Stop being an idiot! We're the cops
on the case. It's our case. We are
going to find the fuckin' killers.

RODRIGUEZ
WE'RE THE FUCKIN' KILLERS!
 

DIVINCI

Since when does that matter?!

Rodriguez stares at Divinci for a beat, then we --


CUT TO:

EXT. UNMARKED CAR - PARKED - DAY

Rodriguez and Divinci are sitting on the car, each with
a
beer and sharing a bottle of whiskey.

DIVINCI

All they want is someone to go down for the crime, right? Do we care who goes down for the crime? Fuck no. As long as someone goes down for the crime. It's a slot that's gotta be filled.

Rodriguez is calmer, but still something bothers him --

RODRIGUEZ

We killed a cop, doesn't that bother you?

DIVINCI

Of course it bothers me. What d'you
want me to do, turn myself in? Well
I'm not. That's the risk we take
everyday, somebody might pop us,
especially undercover like that. So
he got popped. It happens.

RODRIGUEZ

Not by other cops!

DIVINCI

I patted him down! He wasn't wearin' a wire, he had no badge, no gun, how was I supposed to know?!

A moment of silence, then --

DIVINCI

Look, I feel just as bad as you do, but we gotta start thinkin' about us here. The important thing is we don't lose control of the case. We can
 
never lose control of the case.

Whatever evidence there is goes
through us. We lay down the trail.
Make it nice and logical. We're the
teachers and two and two can add up
to five if it's our classroom.

RODRIGUEZ

What're you talkin' about, are you
sayin' we stick somebody with this?

DIVINCI

Evidence points wherever we want it
to point. Shit, we can provide so
much evidence, even the asshole we

pick will think he fuckin' killed
him.

RODRIGUEZ

You got some asshole in mind?

DIVINCI

Just don't worry. We'll find a killer.
There's lots of 'em out there.


CUT TO:

EXT. STREET - DAY

THREE AFRICAN AMERICAN YOUTHS, all in their twenties,
are
hanging on a street corner. Talking. Normal street
traffic.
They give a long hard look to an ATTRACTIVE AFRICAN
AMERICAN
WOMAN who walks past. A little chatter.

The UNMARKED CAR suddenly screeches to the curb. The
black
youths scatter quickly as Divinci jumps out and goes
after

the tallest of the three. His name is JAMES. Rodriguez
guns
the car and gives chase on wheels.

James darts across traffic. Divinci running hard after
him.

Rodriguez spins the car in a u-turn. Racing after them.

EXT. ALLEY - SAME TIME
 

James darts down the alley. Narrow, dark, lined with
trash
bins. Divinci turns into the alley, but he isn't going
to
catch him.

James is almost to the end when the car turns into the
alley,
skidding to a stop. Rodriguez jumps out, gun leveled at
James.

No where for him to go. He slows down. Rodriguez moves
in

from his front, Divinci runs up from behind. James is disgusted.

JAMES

What the hell'd I do now?


CUT TO:

INT. POLICE STATION - EVIDENCE STORAGE ROOM - DAY

Divinci removes the PACKAGE OF COCAINE and the .44 from
the
shelf. CASE NUMBER C-549087.


CUT TO:

THE .44 - INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

SLIDING across a table to James, who stops it with his
right
hand. Divinci and Rodriguez are across from him.

JAMES

Ain't my gun.

DIVINCI

Never is, is it.

JAMES

That ain't my fuckin' gun.

He shoves the gun back. Divinci stops it with his arm,
careful
not to touch it.

DIVINCI
 
Got your fuckin' prints on it.

James quickly realizes what they've done. He lunges for
the
gun, but Divinci picks it up quickly with a pencil
through
the trigger guard. James glares at them with murderous
intent.

RODRIGUEZ
Where were you Friday night?

JAMES

Friday night... last Friday night?

RODRIGUEZ
Where were you?

JAMES

Whatever you think I did went down
last Friday night?

DIVINCI
Better have a good alibi, James, or
it's good ali bye-bye.

A beat, then James smiles.

JAMES

I was in jail you assholes. Check it out.
(starts to laugh)
All night. What a couple a dickheads!

Rodriguez and Divinci are silent.


CUT TO:

DOOR - INT. APARTMENT - DAY

KICKED IN on a grungy small apartment. Divinci and

Rodriguez
burst in, guns drawn. Scaring the shit out of an
HISPANIC
MAN (CORTEZ) and his half-naked GIRLFRIEND as they
watch
television.

DIVINCI AND RODRIGUEZ
NOBODY MOVE! HANDS IN THE AIR! NOW!
MOVE IT!
 

CUT BACK TO:

SLIDING across the table back to Rodriguez and Divinci.
Cortez
sits across from them. Wearing white t-shirt, baggy
pants.
Tattoos on his arms.

CORTEZ

Ain't my gun.

RODRIGUEZ

(smiles)
Got your prints on it.

CORTEZ

(stands; angry)
You fuck, I ain't never seen that
gun before!

RODRIGUEZ

Where were you last Friday night?

CORTEZ

Fuck you. I wanna talk to a lawyer!

Just want they wanted to hear. No alibi.

RODRIGUEZ

Lawyer's not gonna help you, Cortez. All the evidence we got points right to you.

Cortez stares at them for a moment, then --

CORTEZ

Did you say last Friday night?

Cortez smiles and pulls up his shirt, revealing a long

scar
across his stomach.

CORTEZ

Intensive Care, you pindejo fuckin'
gutter shits. And Thursday night,
and Saturday, too. I just fucking
got out this morning.
 

CUT TO:

MAN - EXT. ALLEY - DAY

SLAMMING INTO A WALL, hitting hard, falling back to the
dirty
garbage covered alley. He's about twenty-seven, thin,
blond
hair tied in a pony tail. He wears a flannel shirt,
jeans,
boots. He doesn't want to fight. His name is DAVE.

DAVE

Alright, alright, alright... shit. I ain't gonna fight you.

He looks up at Divinci and Rodriguez moving toward him.


CUT TO:

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

Dave is behind the desk handling the .44 with no
apparent
problem.

DAVE
Ain't my gun.

RODRIGUEZ

That's what they all say.

DAVE

Wish it was. No better gun than Smitty and Wes .44 mag with serial numbers filed off.

(opens cylinder)
Got any bullets?

Divinci walks around, holds out his hand for the gun.

DAVE

Who did I kill?

DIVINCI

Where were you last Friday night?

DAVE

You mean, what's my alibi right?
 
Dave spits on the gun, wipes off his prints with his

shirt.

DAVE

I was breakin' and entering. Jewelry store on seventh and Front, about nine o'clock. Not even close to your jurisdiction. I got the rocks to prove it.

He drops the gun, clean of prints onto the table.

DAVE

Sorry I can't help ya. But one to
five is better than ten to life.

Divinci and Rodriguez stare at Dave. They are not
happy.


CUT TO:

MUG SHOTS - INT. HOMICIDE SQUAD ROOM - DAY

in plastic pages. A BINDER full of criminal portraits.
Divinci
is going through one book. Rodriguez searches another.

DIVINCI
Montrose LaJolla...

RODRIGUEZ

We pulled him in last year for knifing that dealer on 32nd.

DIVINCI

Yeah. Almost killed him, remember?
He'd be good.
(calls out to ANOTHER
DETECTIVE)

Anybody seen Montrose LaJolla?

ANOTHER DETECTIVE

He's dead. His life partner killed
him in a Domestic D about a month
ago.

Rodriguez suddenly slams his book shut.

RODRIGUEZ

Shit!
 
Divinci looks at him. Rodriguez is angry, tense.

Divinci
gives him a look telling him this is not the time and
place
for a discussion on this topic.

DIVINCI

Take it easy.

RODRIGUEZ
This isn't gonna work!

Divinci leans toward Rodriguez.

DIVINCI

Nobody said it was gonna be easy.
But let's not advertise our despair...
Okay?

The PHONE RINGS. Divinci picks it up.

DIVINCI

(into phone)
Divinci.

INT. CAPT. HENDERSON'S OFFICE - DAY

Captain Henderson is sitting behind his desk. Divinci
and
Rodriguez are in front of him. Rodriguez is trying to

hide
his nervousness. Divinci is absolutely cool.

DIVINCI

This is our case! Not the goddamn
DEA's!

CAPT. HENDERSON

It's been three days.

DIVINCI

We're not fuckin' magicians! What the hell is three days?! This is a goddamn murder case! It takes a little bit of goddamn time!

CAPT. HENDERSON

When a Federal Undercover Officer goes down, it's never a fuckin' murder case! I don't like the DEA on my ass any better than you like 'em on yours. But this is personal for them and
 

they want answers. Forget your other cases and get something, anything that I can give to them. The last thing I want is the goddamn F.B.I. on my back, too.

Divinci and Rodriguez are quiet for a beat, then --

DIVINCI

We've got a couple leads. We need a
little more time.

CAPT. HENDERSON

I can't hold 'em off much longer.

RODRIGUEZ
This is no fuckin' way to run an
investigation.

CAPT. HENDERSON

Let me tell you both something, if you don't solve this quick, they're gonna start askin' why? And they'll be lookin' to blame somebody in this department. So my advise to you is, get something fuckin' fast or turn over what you've got and get outa the way.

Rodriguez and Divinci are quiet for a moment, then --

DIVINCI

How much time we got?

CAPT. HENDERSON
A couple days. The funeral's this
afternoon.

RODRIGUEZ

What funeral?

CAPT. HENDERSON

For Agent Hudd. Simms wants you there.

DIVINCI

What for? We didn't know him.

CAPT. HENDERSON

How the hell do I know?! It's DEA, it's their thing. You're the cops on the case, I suppose they want you to know what a great guy Hudd was so
 
you'll work all that harder to find

his killer. Just go. It'll reassure
'em how much you care and keep 'em
off my ass.


CUT TO:

EXT. CEMETERY - GRAVE SITE - LATE AFTERNOON

MOURNERS gathered around the grave site. WIFE in tears.
MOTHER
in tears. The men trying their best to hold up. Beyond
the

family, DEA AGENTS. Simms among them. A show of support

and
solidarity. A REVEREND delivering --

REVEREND

--	and it is too easy to say that he was a good man in his job because he gave more than most. And it's too easy to say that he was a good man in his community because he gave more than others. And it's too easy to say he was a good man at home with his family because he was always there when they needed him. Special Agent Lionel Hudd was not just a good man, he was an extraordinary man. And his death shall not be in vain.

CAMERA FINDS Divinci and Rodriguez at the back.
Rodriguez
looks nervous. Divinci notices. Their conversation is
quiet.

DIVINCI

Don't Humpty Dumpty on me.

RODRIGUEZ

What's that mean?

DIVINCI

Your cracks are startin' to show.

RODRIGUEZ
(covering)
Bullshit.

Divinci sees Simms approaching from the side.
 

DIVINCI

Get your balance. Here comes the
King.

Rodriguez glances toward Simms as he walks up. The conversation is quiet. Not wanting to disturb the

ceremony.

SIMMS
Glad you came... Anything break?

Divinci glances at Rodriguez.

DIVINCI

Nothin' to brag about. But we've got a couple new leads we're followin'.

SIMMS

...Look, normally we'd be all over this, but your Captain seems to think you can do the job. It's your territory. I guess you know it better than anybody. And that can be worth a lot. But you understand... we won't wait forever.

Divinci is pissed. He doesn't like Simms.

DIVINCI

Just outa curiosity... What happened to his backup? You guys use backup on undercover don't you?

SIMMS
It was a new lead. Hudd was afraid
backup would blow his cover. He was
supposed to check in ten minutes
after the deal went down. He never
checked in.

RODRIGUEZ

We want this one as bad as you do. A cop's a cop. We're in this together, right?

Simms stares at Rodriguez and Divinci for a moment,
then he
returns his attention to the ceremony.

SIMMS

That's why I asked you to come here.
 
Just so you knew that.


CUT TO:

EXT. HOT DOG VENDOR STREET - DUSK

Rodriguez and Divinci walk down the street, hot dogs in
hand,
returning to their car parked curbside.

DIVINCI

He didn't have backup. You believe
that?! Jesus what a dick.

RODRIGUEZ
I don't think we should criticize
that particular decision of his.

DIVINCI

I don't care what the reasons are,
you don't play Lone Fuckin' Ranger
on a drug buy. You're just askin'
for it. That's all I'm sayin'.

RODRIGUEZ

I don't trust those bastards. They're not waitin' for us. That's bullshit. They're runnin' their own investigation. I know it!

DIVINCI

Let 'em. The gun, the coke came from evidence. The car came from impound. So what's to find?

RODRIGUEZ

That's what I'm afraid of. There's
nothing for them to find. We were
too good.

DIVINCI

So what're you worried about?

RODRIGUEZ

Nobody is that fuckin' good.

Divinci looks at Rodriguez, then smiles.

DIVINCI

Except us.
 

CUT TO:

STRIPPER - INT. STRIP JOINT - NIGHT

bumping and grinding her way through her performance.
We
don't see her face yet. Just her body. G-string and
skin
tight tank top. LOUD MUSIC. MEN in the audience
appreciative.
The room is smoky. LIGHTS swirl over the stage. The
tank top
comes off. WHISTLES and CHEERS. And now we see the
dancer --

it's CYNTHIA.

INT. HALLWAY - BACK STAGE - NIGHT

Cynthia moves down the hall in her g-string and high
heels.
She enters the dressing room.

INT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

Divinci is sitting in the only chair in the cramped
little
room. He's going through her purse. Cynthia stops when
she
sees him, then shuts the door.

CYNTHIA

I think this is breaking and entering, isn't it?

DIVINCI

I work homicide, I don't deal with
that shit.

CYNTHIA

(puts on robe)
Learn anything you didn't already

have on file?

DIVINCI

Yeah. You surprise me sometimes. Here I think you're just a hard case and I discover you've got a heart of gold.

(holds up her drivers
license)
You're an organ donor. That's really
 
nice. The only problem is, they'll

never use your best parts.

CYNTHIA
I'll make sure you get them.

DIVINCI

Hey, don't get me wrong. I was just
surprised that we had something in
common... Besides what we have in
common.

CYNTHIA

Do everybody a favor, if you're gonna donate your heart, make sure it goes to science. Most people want one that beats.

DIVINCI

Cynthia... pretty name. What do the
first three letters spell?

CYNTHIA
Don't get so clever. It's out of
character.


CUT TO:

INT. CYNTHIA'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Divinci and Cynthia are lying in bed. Divinci has his
arm
around her, but he's staring at the ceiling.

CYNTHIA

What's so interesting up there?

DIVINCI

Nothing.

CYNTHIA

Then why's it got all your attention?

DIVINCI

I'm thinkin', that's all.

CYNTHIA
About us?

DIVINCI

No.
 

CYNTHIA

Good.

Divinci looks at Cynthia.

DIVINCI

What if I was thinkin' about us?

CYNTHIA
Don't waste your time.

DIVINCI

What if I was?

CYNTHIA
Where's it gonna get us?

DIVINCI

Maybe I got plans.

CYNTHIA

I don't wanna hear 'em. Plans just
make you think somethin's gonna get
better. I'm fine now. I don't need
to get screwed up waitin' for
something good to happen.

DIVINCI
I just want you to know, love is
important to me.

CYNTHIA

Me, too.

DIVINCI

But more important is loyalty. Nothing is more important than that. Not love, not anything. Because loyalty is about respect. You can talk about love all you want, but without respect it's empty. I mean the first thing that goes in a marriage is respect. And once it's gone, forget the love. So I am telling you, I am loyal to you. Like I'm loyal to my partner.

We are closer than blood. And I trust him with my life.

Cynthia didn't really expect this from Divinci. She's actually, despite herself, a little touched.
 
CYNTHIA

Why're you telling me this?

DIVINCI

When you asked if I was thinkin' about us and I said I wasn't, I just want you to know that I do.

A beat, then --

CYNTHIA

Just don't ask me to marry you.

DIVINCI

(smiles)

Why aren't more women like you?

Divinci leans in and they kiss.


CUT TO:

EXT. CYNTHIA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Divinci exits the building. Starts to cross the street
to
his car parked on the opposite side when he HEARS
SOMETHING
BEHIND him. He turns, instantly reaching for his
pistol.

A drunk staggers out of the alley -- looks like he has
a gun
in his hand.

Divinci instinctively raises his gun to shoot when --

THE LIGHT -- catches the object in the drunk's hand --
a
BROWN BOTTLE, the neck sticking ahead like the barrel
of a
gun.
