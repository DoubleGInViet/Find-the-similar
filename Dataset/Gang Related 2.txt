DIVINCI

(lowers gun)
You fuckin' idiot.

The drunk stops when he hears the voice. Looks through
his
matted greasy hair that cascades in front of his eyes.
Now
we recognize Joe.
 

Divinci turns away, disgusted. Opens his car door, then
stops.
Caught in a thought. He turns back and looks at Joe
again.

EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

Joe stumbles back into the DARKNESS OF THE ALLEY. Lies
down
next to a trash bin. LIGHTS suddenly illuminate Joe.
Joe
squints as a CAR moves right up to him. Joe shields the
light
with an arm.

We HEAR the DOOR OPEN and CLOSE, then Divinci bends
down
into the LIGHT. He is wearing a BASEBALL CAP backwards
on
his head. And GLOVES on his hands. He reaches inside
Joe's
JACKET POCKET.

DIVINCI

What've we got here?

He pulls out the Smith and Wesson .44. Divinci looks at
Joe.

DIVINCI

Where were you last Friday night?

Confused, Joe looks up at Divinci through matted hair.


CUT TO:

INT. CAR - DRIVING - NIGHT (EARLY MORNING)

Divinci drives. Joe up front. In an alcoholic daze.

DIVINCI'S VOICE

What's your name?

Joe looks at Divinci. Having trouble focusing.

DIVINCI
Your name, what's your name?

WILLIAM

...Joe...
 

DIVINCI

Where'd you get the gun, Joe?

Joe looks down at his hands -- he's holding the .44.

DIVINCI

It was in your pocket, Joe, your
coat pocket. You must keep it for
protection, right?

WILLIAM

I don't know.

DIVINCI

Sure you do, Joe. Everybody needs
protection. Especially a guy like
you lives on the street, right?

Joe just stares at the gun.

DIVINCI

Put it back in your pocket, Joe. You don't have to worry about me, I'm not gonna hurt you.

Joe puts the gun into his jacket pocket.


CUT TO:

EXT. STREET - EARLY MORNING

The LOCATION of HUDD'S MURDER. The street is empty.
Quiet.
Divinci stops his car next to where Hudd died.

INT. DIVINCI'S CAR - EARLY MORNING

Joe is asleep, leaning against the window. Divinci
reaches
across and yanks him.

DIVINCI

Wake up, Joe! I want you to look at something. Out the window, Joe. Look out the window.

Joe's eyes open. Divinci forces his head to the window.

DIVINCI

This is where it happened, Joe. I
 
want you to remember it. This is

where you killed him

Joe tries to turn to Divinci, but Divinci holds his
head.

DIVINCI

You remember it now? How you shot
him through the head? You remember
it?

WILLIAM

I... don't...

DIVINCI

(lets go of Joe)
You will.

Divinci slams his foot down on the accelerator and --

THE CAR

-- tears off down the street.


CUT TO:

RODRIGUEZ - INT. BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

asleep. Alone in a double bed. The PHONE RINGS.
Rodriguez
startles awake. Catches the phone on the second ring.

RODRIGUEZ

Who the hell is this?

INTERCUT WITH DIVINCI - INT. MOTEL ROOM - EARLY MORNING

Divinci on the phone in the f.g. Joe is passed out on
the
bed in the b.g. The room is dark.

DIVINCI

Is that any way to answer the phone?

RODRIGUEZ

Divinci, shit! It's quarter to six.

DIVINCI

I know what time it is, I'm not the one in bed. I need the photos of the scene.
 

RODRIGUEZ

Now?

DIVINCI

I got a suspect. But he can't remember all the details. He needs a little help. And I thought, since you're my partner, you might jump at the opportunity to lend me a fuckin' hand.


Rodriguez sits up in bed.

RODRIGUEZ

He doesn't remember last Friday?

DIVINCI

He doesn't remember a lotta Fridays. Bring the shots and pick up a fifth of Vodka.

(glances at Joe)
Make it two.


CUT TO:

JOE - INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY

asleep on the bed.

DIVINCI

Time to get up, Joe.

Divinci slaps him. Joe's eyes open.

DIVINCI

I want you to look at something.

The room is still dark. Curtains drawn. We now see
Rodriguez.
He's wearing a black sock cap and gloves. He hands

Divinci
POLICE PHOTOGRAPHS of the car, the street, the victim -
- the
murder scene. Divinci pulls Joe into a sitting
position.

DIVINCI

There's the guy and the street and
the car. You remember how you shot
him.
 

Joe stares at the photographs and starts to shake his
head.

DIVINCI

You don't remember? That's not what
you told me last night.

Joe is confused.

DIVINCI

If you remember you can have a drink.

Joe looks at the bottle Rodriguez holds out to him.

DIVINCI

But you gotta remember how you saw him driving toward you and you were in the street and you were afraid he was going to hit you so you had to shoot to protect yourself. You remember now don't you?

Joe stares at the photographs for a moment, then nods.

DIVINCI

And where's your gun, Joe, where do
you keep your gun?

Joe thinks a moment, then reaches into his coat pocket
and

pulls out the .44. Divinci hands Joe the bottle and Joe drinks. We PUSH IN on the BOTTLE OF VODKA as the liquid

drains
away and we CLOSE IN TIGHT until we can SEE LIONEL
HUDD'S
FACE as we --


DISSOLVE TO:

CLOSE UP - THE PHOTOGRAPHS

Hudd dead. Blood on the windows. The street. Joe is
drunk
again. In a haze. Starts to lift the bottle. Rodriguez
pulls
it away. Rodriguez and Divinci always stay behind Joe.

RODRIGUEZ

Why'd you kill him?
 
WILLIAM

I... don't know...

RODRIGUEZ
It was your gun.

WILLIAM

...I don't have a gun.

DIVINCI
Yes you do. In your pocket.

WILLIAM

...I'm tired.

DIVINCI
I know, Joe, it's tough to remember
things you don't wanna remember.
What about your last name, Joe. You
got a last name?

Joe looks up as if trying to remember. Or trying not
to.

RODRIGUEZ

Come on, Joe, everybody's got a last name.

WILLIAM
I don't remember.

RODRIGUEZ

Don't fuck with us, Joe. We're trying to help you. What's your last goddamn name?

Joe shakes his head.

WILLIAM

I don't know.

Rodriguez suddenly smacks Joe on the side of the head

when
he tries to look back. Joe is surprised by the blow.
Divinci
pushes Rodriguez back. Shakes his head telling him to
back
off.

DIVINCI

(to Joe; friendly)
Come on, we're all tired here, Joe.
 
Just give us your last name.

WILLIAM

I don't remember.

DIVINCI

...Okay, fine, what's in a name? But you remember the gun, right, in your pocket.

Joe nods.

DIVINCI

And you remember that you told me you thought he was going to hit you, right? That's why you shot...

WILLIAM

...Yeah.

Divinci looks at Rodriguez. Rodriguez nods.

DIVINCI

How'd it happen, Joe, tell me how it happened.
(prompting)
You saw him driving toward you --

WILLIAM
-- I saw him driving toward me --


CUT TO:

INT. CAR - NIGHT - LIONEL HUDD

driving. The night that he was shot. He looks ahead
into the
darkness of the street. Suddenly he SEES --

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

A MAN standing in the street ahead of him.

HUDD - INT. CAR - NIGHT

smiles and turns toward the man in the street.

A .44

is pulled from a jacket pocket, lifted toward the
APPROACHING
 

CAR. The gun is in the hands of Joe. He is scared. The HEADLIGHTS COMING RIGHT AT HIM. He aims and FIRES the

gun.

THE FRONT WINDOW

SHATTERS. And the car swerves to the curb.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Joe watches from the street, then looks at the .44 in
his
hand.

BACK INSIDE THE MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Rodriguez leans into Joe who is now sitting on the edge
of
the bed, looking down at the .44 in his hand.

RODRIGUEZ

Then what did you do?

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Joe is in the street again. He doesn't know what he
did.

BACK INSIDE THE MOTEL ROOM

Divinci leans close to Joe from behind now.

DIVINCI

You ran.

And now Joe can imagine it. We PUSH INTO JOE'S EYES.

BACK TO THE STREET

as Joe turns and runs. As fast as he can away from the
death.
He looks back over his shoulder, scared.

JOE'S VOICE

I didn't mean to...

BACK INSIDE THE MOTEL ROOM

Joe is staring at the gun. Divinci and Rodriguez watch
him.

WILLIAM
 
He was going to hit me... I was

scared... he was going to hit me.

Rodriguez looks at Divinci.

DIVINCI

That's why you shot him.

WILLIAM

That's why I...

JOE - BACK ON THE STREET - NIGHT

AIMS the gun again at the APPROACHING CAR.

JOE'S VOICE
...shot him.

And we HEAR the GUN SHOT AGAIN, shattering the silence
as we --


CUT TO:

THE SMOKING .44 - INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - DAY

held by Joe's hand, which is held by Divinci's gloved
hand.

Divinci has held Joe's finger on the trigger and pulled
it.

The gunshot is deadened in the old building. Joe is
lying in
the back seat of a car, passed out, with Divinci
holding the
.44 in his hand. The back door is open. The engine is
running.

DIVINCI

Helluva nice shot, Joe.

Divinci pulls the 44. out of Joe's hand, then shuts the

door,

gets into the front. The car pulls away, exiting the warehouse.

HAND - INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - POLICE STATION - DAY

signing a name at the bottom of a paper -- Joe. Beneath
it

is the type written name: JOE DOE. We PULL BACK and see
it's
 
Joe signing a typewritten page as Divinci and Rodriguez

watch.
Joe is a mess. When he finishes he pushes the paper
away and
puts his head down on the table. Divinci picks up the
paper
and we --


CUT TO:

EXT. CYNTHIA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

A small yellow Toyota with a bashed up left fender
pulls to

the curb. Cynthia gets out lugging her purse and a bag
of
groceries. We HEAR ANOTHER CAR DOOR SHUT. She turns.
Divinci
is walking across the street from his car toward her.

CYNTHIA

It's the middle of the day.

Divinci gives her a look as he takes the grocery bag
from
her.

DIVINCI
Just talk.

CYNTHIA

Since when?

Divinci leads the way into the apartment building.

INT. CYNTHIA'S APARTMENT - DAY

Cynthia opens the door, pulls the key out of the lock
as
Divinci enters behind her with the groceries.

DIVINCI

I need you to do something.

CYNTHIA

Good, I need the money.

She shuts the door. Divinci deposits the bag on the
table.
Cynthia picks it up, moves into the kitchen.
 
DIVINCI

This isn't a deal. Where you goin'?

CYNTHIA
I got perishables, okay?

Cynthia enters the kitchen and Divinci follows. Cynthia
starts
unloading the groceries, putting the milk, eggs, etc.
into
the refrigerator.

DIVINCI

The guy we did the last deal with is dead.

Cynthia turns suddenly.

CYNTHIA

What?

DIVINCI

Somebody popped him that night, probably when he tried to unload the stuff. I don't know.

CYNTHIA

Jesus, does anybody --

DIVINCI

--	Don't worry, there's no connection. We got the guy who did it.

Cynthia breathes a sigh of relief.

CYNTHIA

You scared the hell outa me.

DIVINCI

We just need you to do one thing.

CYNTHIA

...What?


CUT TO:

INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

Divinci and Rodriguez are moving down a hallway with
Cynthia.
She's nervous. Wants very much not to be here.
 

DIVINCI

He'll be third from the left. Don't
fuck up. Third from the left.

CYNTHIA

What'm I supposed to say?

DIVINCI

Just look at 'em and then look at
the man the third from the left and
say, It's him.

RODRIGUEZ

And I'll say, Are you sure?

DIVINCI

And you say, Absolutely. No question.

CYNTHIA

This is all I need to do right?

DIVINCI
We have a signed confession. You
i.d. him, he's goin' straight into
the can.

CYNTHIA

Okay, okay. But this is it. I'm not
doin' anything more than this.

DIVINCI

Hey, it's a done deal.


CUT TO:

INT. POLICE LINEUP ROOM - DAY

ROWS of seats face a small platform. The LINEUP WALL is striped with horizontal lines with HEIGHT NUMBERS. The brightly lighted lineup is separated from the gallery,
which
is in the dark.

UNIFORMED GUARDS are on hand to make sure there is no discussion, verbal or otherwise, between accused and
witness.
SIX MEN file onto the platform. All shady characters.

A VOICE

Stop and face front.
 

The six men obey. A couple keep their heads down. The
others
squint from the bright lights.

THE VOICE

Lift your heads, look straight.

Heads are lifted. Eyes front. But we only recognize one
of
them, standing third from the left. It's Joe.

Divinci, Rodriguez and Cynthia are in the gallery.

DIVINCI

Take your time. Try and remember his face.

Cynthia counts three from the left and... wait a
minute. She
looks more closely. Just to be sure. Rodriguez and
Divinci

watch her. She's obviously putting on a good show. Then
she
turns to Divinci, sitting next to her and whispers --

CYNTHIA

I know him.

Divinci is caught a little of guard -- he didn't expect
a
private conversation, nor does he want one for fear of
it
looking like he's coaching her.

DIVINCI

If you can identify the man --

CYNTHIA

(whisper)
I know him.

DIVINCI

Just tell us which one.

Cynthia, frustrated, gives Divinci a look.

CYNTHIA
No. I fucking know him.

Divinci still isn't sure what's gotten into her.
Rodriguez
 
looks over, a little annoyed.

RODRIGUEZ

What's the problem?

DIVINCI

There's no problem!
(to Cynthia; pointedly)
Do you see him up there?!

CYNTHIA

(aside)
You don't understand.

Divinci is losing his patience. He doesn't want to blow

the
whole thing now, not in front of guards and police
personnel.
The Guards are beginning to wonder what the hell's
going on.
So are the MEN in the line.

ONE OF THE MEN
Hey, come on, do it or don't!

THE VOICE

No talking.

Divinci leans in close to her. We can HEAR GRUMBLING
from

the men on the platform.

DIVINCI

Pick the asshole out!

Cynthia starts to protest again, but she suddenly feels Divinci's hand grip her arm. He's had enough. Cynthia

gets
the message. And while keeping her eyes locked on
Divinci
she says --

CYNTHIA

Third man from the left.

JOE

squints against the harsh light, trying to see into the
room,
as if he recognized the voice.
 

CUT TO:

INT. HALLWAY - POLICE STATION - OUTSIDE THE LINEUP ROOM
-
DAY

Rodriguez, Divinci and Cynthia move briskly down the
hall.
None happy about what just happened. The conversation
is
strained.

DIVINCI

You mind telling me what that was

all about?!

CYNTHIA

I know him. He hangs around my
building. He lives in the alley or
something.

Rodriguez looks at Divinci. Is this a problem?

DIVINCI

You don't think people that hang around your neighborhood can kill somebody. Well let me tell you something. You don't live in a great fuckin' neighborhood.

Divinci pulls a paper from his pocket.

DIVINCI

Just sign the goddamn paper.

CYNTHIA

What paper?

RODRIGUEZ

You picked a man out of a lineup,
you have to sign that you did that

so they don't think we made it up.

Cynthia just stares at Rodriguez for a beat, then --

CYNTHIA

Now why the hell would they think
something like that?

DIVINCI

Sign it.
 

CYNTHIA

You said all I had to do was pick
him out.

DIVINCI

This is part of it. Just sign it and you're done.

CYNTHIA
How come you're so sure it was him?

Rodriguez rolls his eyes.

RODRIGUEZ

Jesus Christ!

DIVINCI

He confessed.

CYNTHIA

Bullshit.

RODRIGUEZ

We got it in writing.

CYNTHIA

He didn't do it.

DIVINCI

How the hell d'you know that? Were
you with him at the time?! You have
a good goddamn alibi for him?!

RODRIGUEZ
Maybe she was blowing him!

CYNTHIA

Better him than you.

Rodriguez grabs her arm and pushes her against the
wall.

Divinci looks around quickly to see who's watching.

DIVINCI

Take it easy.

Rodriguez angrily throws up his hands and glares at
Divinci.

RODRIGUEZ

Fine, I got nothin' at stake here.
 

Divinci gives him a look, then leans right up next to
Cynthia.

DIVINCI

This is what they call an open and shut case. He did the kill and he's going down. Don't make the mistake of thinking you know the right thing to do.

Divinci holds out the paper. Cynthia hesitates a beat,
then
takes it and signs her name.


CUT TO:

JOE - CLOSE SHOT - MUG SHOTS

holding a number. The SCENE FADES WHITE with the FLASH.


DISSOLVE TO:

CELL DOOR - INT. JAIL - DAY

closing on Joe who is standing in the small CELL,
facing the
wall, his back to us. The door is locked and we --


CUT TO:

INT. EVIDENCE ROOM - DAY

as the .44 is placed on a shelf. But this time it's
tagged
with a different number. M5114000.


CUT TO:

THE SIGNED CONFESSION - INT. CAPT. HENDERSON'S OFFICE -
DAY

as Agent Simms reads through it to the end.

SIMMS

Doe?
 
Simms looks across at Rodriguez and Divinci. Capt.

Henderson
and TWO OTHER DEA AGENTS (HOOPER and SARKASIAN) are
also
present. The DEA are in suits and ties.

RODRIGUEZ

He wouldn't give us his last name.

SIMMS

He signed a confession but he wouldn't give you his last name?

DIVINCI

He said he couldn't remember it.

(points to his head)
He's a head case.

AGENT HOOPER

You run prints?

RODRIGUEZ

No priors.

AGENT SARKASIAN

Ballistics match?

RODRIGUEZ

We're waiting. But a forty-four was
used in commission. He had a forty-

four on him.

AGENT HOOPER

It went down pretty quick.

DIVINCI

It's our street.

CAPT. HENDERSON

I think they did a helluva job.

Suddenly Simms slams his hand down on the desk.

SIMMS

Goddammit!

Everyone turns to Simms. He's angry. Rodriguez is
uneasy.

SIMMS

Some goddamn piece a shit blows him
away for NOTHING!
 

The intensity of Simms anger quiets everybody. A beat
as
Simms regains his composure.

SIMMS

I'm sorry. Hudd was too good for this to happen... I just didn't think he'd go down this way.

Simms crosses the room to Divinci and Rodriguez.

SIMMS

Good work. Thanks.

He shakes their hands. Then exits. Hooper and Sarkasian
follow
their boss out the door. Rodriguez, Divinci and
Henderson
exchange a look.

CAPT. HENDERSON

Do me a favor. Make sure this one sticks. I don't want the D.E.Assholes back in here.


CUT TO:

HEADLIGHTS (B&W)

coming right at us. Closer and closer. Filling the
screen.

FLAMES BURST (COLOR)

from the barrel of a .44 in SLOW MOTION -- a FIREBALL.
The
GUNSHOT is deafening, like thunder.

GLASS

SHATTERS in SLOW MOTION.

JOE

covers his face with his hands to protect himself from
the
glass. But there is no glass. Joe is sweating,
detoxing.
Wild eyed. He looks through his fingers, but there is
no
 
street, no dead man. Just the BARS of his CELL.


CUT TO:

GLASS OF WHISKEY - INT. CYNTHIA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

golden liquid caressing the ice. A hand lifts the glass
to
red lips. The liquid disappears. Cynthia lowers the
glass,
staring at it.

DIVINCI'S VOICE (FILTERED)

Cynthia... pretty name. What do the

first three letters spell?

Cynthia suddenly hurls the glass across the room.

THE GLASS - SLOW MOTIONS

shatters against the wall. And bits of glass, edges
sharp
tumble through space like ice.


CUT TO:

INT. POLICE JAIL - CELLBLOCK HALLWAY - DAY

A GUARD leads a MAN in a dark suit and striped tie down
the
corridor. He carries a briefcase. Short hair and a
beard and
wire-rimmed glasses. His name is ELLIOT GOFF.

GUARD

Word is he killed a DEA undercover...
(no response)
Word is he shot him in the face...
(no response)
Word is he signed a confession.

ELLIOT

Word is everyone's entitled to a defense... no matter how guilty they are.

They stop at the cell block door. The guard unlocks the
door.
INSIDE THE CELL we can see Joe on the floor in fetal
position.
 
Shaking from lack of alcohol.

ELLIOT

Oh shit.


CUT TO:

INT. INFIRMARY - DAY

Elliot waits in the hall. Fingers impatiently drumming
his
briefcase. The door opens and a DOCTOR exits the room.

DOCTOR

He's detoxing. I gave him something
to help him through it.

ELLIOT

Can I talk to him?

The doctor nods, opens the door. Elliot enters.

INT. INFIRMARY - DAY

Basic first aid station. Joe is on a table. Eyes
closed.
Elliot walks up. Doctor behind him.

ELLIOT

Joe, can you hear me?

Joe's eyes open.

ELLIOT
I'm Elliot Goff. I'm your attorney...
Do you understand what I'm saying?

Joe's eyes close. Leaving Elliot in the dark.


CUT TO:

INT. SMALL COURTROOM - DAY

Court is in session. Old metropolitan courthouse. The PROSECUTOR and his TEAM are at one table. The DEFENSE
ATTORNEY
and his CLIENT are at the other.

The Prosecutor is a woman. Her name is HELEN EDEN. She
is
 
thirty-nine. She wears a business suit. RICHARD STEIN

is her
second in command. Richard is thirty-three.

The DEFENSE ATTORNEY is fifty and a little on the
portly
side. His name is JOHN OBLINGER.

But it's the DEFENDANT that really attracts our
attention.
His name is CLYDE D. DUNNER. He's done his best to look
like
a law abiding citizen, but no matter what kind of
clothes he

wears or how he slicks down his long hair or trims his mustache, this sonuvabitch looks like he'd kill for a
nickel.

He's on trial for murder. In the first. What a
surprise.

We are in the midst of opening statements. And Helen is keeping the JURY riveted. The presiding Judge is a
WOMAN,
JUDGE WEINBERG.

HELEN

--	when the defendant, Clyde Dunner, entered the house of George and Carol Beaman on Friday night, a .44 caliber pistol in his hand. He entered the house with one thing in mind. To kill George and Carol, the people he blamed for the break up of his marriage to Carol's sister, Paula.

The defendant is hardly listening. His attention is on
TWO
MEN SITTING BEHIND the prosecution table. And he turns
to

glare at them. The two men are DETECTIVES RODRIGUEZ and DIVINCI.

Clyde glares at them as if he'd like to get up right
now,
walk over to them and cut off their heads. Actually,
that's
what he's thinking. He mouths "You die."

Divinci mouths back. "Fuck you, prick, asshole,
dickhead."
Then he smiles. Clyde boils.
 
HELEN

George and Carol were watching a
movie when he entered the living
room and opened fire. George was
killed instantly, hit in the face.
Carol died later of three bullet
wounds to her chest.

John Oblinger, his attorney, catches Clyde's murderous
look
and instructs him, with a point of his hand, to pay
attention
to Helen. Clyde reluctantly turns his gaze from
Divinci.

HELEN

Then the defendant, in his effort to cover up the crime, doused them with lighter fluid and set the house on fire... Carol was still alive.

A YOUNG MAN, looking very upset, enters the courtroom,
shows
i.d. to a GUARD, then makes his way down the aisle. He
tries
his best to be quiet, not to interrupt Helen's
statement.

HELEN

Ladies and gentlemen of the jury we will prove to you, beyond any reasonable doubt, that the defendant, Clyde David Dunner, is guilty of two counts of murder in the first degree.

Helen looks at the jury for a beat, then returns to her
table.

JUDGE WEINBERG

The defense may now proceed.

John Oblinger stands to present his side of the case.

But
our attention stays with Helen as she approaches the
table
to find her team in an upset. Their conversation is a
tense
whisper.

RICHARD STEIN

-- Jesus Christ!
 
YOUNG MAN

-- I don't know where?

RICHARD STEIN
Are you sure?

YOUNG MAN

They looked all over --

HELEN
What's wrong?

RICHARD STEIN

They can't find the murder weapon.

HELEN
What're you talking about?

RICHARD STEIN

Dunner's .44. They can't find the
goddamn gun!

YOUNG MAN

They lost it or something. Misplaced it, I don't know. They can't find it anywhere.

HELEN

(no whisper this time)
What?!

A pause in the court. The judge taps his gavel in anger
as
we --


CUT TO:

INT. HELEN'S OFFICE - DAY

Rodriguez, Divinci, Richard Stein, the young man and
Helen.

Helen is furious.

HELEN

--	I don't have a goddamn case without the goddamn gun. His fingerprints, the ballistics, everything! I have

to have the fucking gun or he's gonna walk. That murdering piece of filth will go free without the .44. How could they lose it?!
 

Rodriguez and Divinci exchange a look.


CUT TO:

RODRIGUEZ AND DIVINCI - EXT. COURTROOM - DAY

walking quickly down the steps.

RODRIGUEZ

The Dunner gun, you used the fucking
Dunner gun?!

DIVINCI

This is not my fuck up! Our shooting was supposed to be gang-related and unsolved! Only because we tagged a goddamn undercover cop do we need the fucking .44 for evidence! Otherwise, we never woulda needed it. So don't point your finger at me!

RODRIGUEZ

Alright, alright... But how are we supposed to explain how the same gun was used in two murder cases by two different killers when it was supposed to be in police custody?!

DIVINCI

We don't explain it. It's not our fault they lost the evidence. Ballistics are already complete in Dunner's case. All we need is another gun.


CUT TO:

BRIEFCASE - ALLEY - DAY

as it opens, revealing a DOZEN different HANDGUNS.

THE GUN SELLER

All my merchandise is in top
condition. Untraceable. The best
money can buy.

A BLACK MAN in a three piece suit, picks up the .44
with a
 
GLOVED HAND. His accent is British.

THE GUN SELLER

It's got good knock down, but it's
slow. Unless you have a preference
for revolvers, I suggest a nine
millimeter auto. They are more
expensive, but what they cost in
money, they save in time.

Rodriguez and Divinci look down at the gun.

DIVINCI

The .44.

The gun seller eyes them for a moment.

RODRIGUEZ

What?

THE GUN SELLER

You look like police.

Divinci and Rodriguez stare at the gun seller. Then he
smiles.

THE GUN SELLER

No offense.


CUT TO:

INT. EVIDENCE ROOM - DAY

as the NEW .44 goes onto the shelf. CASE NUMBER C-
549087.


CUT TO:

INT. JAIL - INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

Elliot is waiting, sitting at a table, staring at
papers in
his open briefcase. Door opens and a GUARD leads Joe
into
the room. Joe looks better, for the first time. His
hair is
combed. And he's clean. He wears jail blues. But he is
a
little gaunt. And tired. Elliot stands. The guard shuts
the
 
door, leaving them alone.

ELLIOT

Joe, I'm Elliot, we met the other...
well, you weren't in very good shape.
You look much better.

Joe just stares at Elliot.

ELLIOT
Have a chair. We need to talk.

WILLIAM

About what I did.

ELLIOT
Yes.

Joe crosses to the table and takes a chair opposite
Elliot.

ELLIOT

Joe, before we get into what happened that night, I'd like to check a couple of things first.

(looks at papers)
Joe is your first name, I assume
Joseph?

WILLIAM

Okay.

Okay? Not the answer Elliot was looking for.

ELLIOT
What about Doe? Is that what you
told the officers your last name
was?

WILLIAM

I don't think so.

ELLIOT

What did you tell them your last
name was?

WILLIAM

I don't remember.

ELLIOT

Well, is Doe your last name?
 
WILLIAM

I'm not sure.

Elliot stares at Joe. This is going to be a little more difficult than he thought.

ELLIOT

Do you know what your last name is?

WILLIAM
I don't remember.

ELLIOT

Joe, I'm your attorney, I'm here to
help you. It doesn't matter if you

give the court your last name or
not, they will still put you on trial.
Do you understand?

WILLIAM

Yes.

ELLIOT

So there's no reason to try and hide your identity.
(Joe nods)
What is your last name?

WILLIAM
I would tell you if I could remember.

ELLIOT

Joe Smith, Joe Jones, Joe DiMaggio...

Elliot hopes he can trigger a response. Joe tries hard.

WILLIAM

...I don't think so.

ELLIOT

Okay. Look, we'll move on. You understand the charges against you. They're serious. And if you are found guilty, you could go to prison for a very long time.

WILLIAM

Maybe I should.

ELLIOT

What?
 
WILLIAM

Go to prison. I killed him. I didn't mean to. But he was going to hit me.

ELLIOT

Yes, I know, I read your confession.
Joe, if you really felt your life
was in danger, we might be able to
use self-defense as our argument.
But before we get into that... Do
you have any family, Joe? Any friends?

WILLIAM

I don't think so.

ELLIOT

Joe... do you know what a psychiatrist is?

WILLIAM

Yes.

ELLIOT
Have you ever seen a psychiatrist?

WILLIAM

...I'm not sure.

ELLIOT
Joe, you don't remember much about
yourself.

WILLIAM

No.

ELLIOT

...but you remember the night you
shot the man in the car.

WILLIAM

Yes.

ELLIOT

Why?

WILLIAM

...because... I can... I'm sorry,
I'm not much help.

Elliot stares at Joe, then looks down at the blank page
in
front of him.
 


CUT TO:

INT. SMALL COURTROOM - DAY

The trial of Clyde D. Dunner in progress. Prosecution
team
at their table. Defense team at their table. JUDGE
WEINBERG
at the bench. Divinci on the stand. Clyde glaring at
him.
And Jury listening to Helen on the floor, prosecuting
with
vigor.

HELEN

--	and when you approached the suspect in his apartment, did you identify yourself as a police officer?

DIVINCI

Yes.

HELEN

Did the suspect respond?

DIVINCI

Yes, he did?

HELEN

In what way?

DIVINCI

He started shooting through the door.

HELEN

The Defendant fired six times, until his gun was empty. We would like to show you the weapon he used.

Helen crosses to the prosecution table, picks up the

.44.
She holds it up for the jury to see.

HELEN

And we would like to enter it into court records. It was the same Smith and Wesson revolver he used to viciously murder George and Carol Beaman.
 
The .44 is duly entered into the records.

CLYDE

glances at "his" .44 as it passes into the BAILIFF'S
HANDS.
It's a .44 all right.

HELEN

The prosecution would like to call
Mr. Steven J. Allen to the stand.

BAILIFF

Steven J. Allen.

STEVEN J. ALLEN, a short balding bespectacled man in
his
fifties, crosses to the witness box where he is sworn
in,
then sits.

HELEN

Mr. Allen, would tell the court what you do.

STEVEN J. ALLEN

I am a lab technician for the police department. One of my duties is to examine weapons used in violent crimes.

Clyde's attention is on Helen's LEGS. He's bored by the proceedings, but something suddenly strikes him. He

looks at --

THE .44 SMITH AND WESSON

-- on the evidence table. There is no BLACK STAIN on
the
handle.

STEVEN J. ALLEN

I tested the defendant's revolver and matched the bullets fired to the bullets removed from the deceased.

CLYDE

That ain't my gun.

All attention turns to Clyde. His attorney, the judge,
the
 
jury, Helen, everybody is surprised by the sudden

statement.

JUDGE WEINBERG
I must remind the defendant that he
is not to speak out when --

CLYDE

That ain't my gun!

The Judge taps her gavel. John Oblinger puts a hand on
Clyde's
arm. Clyde pulls it away. And now things happen very
fast.

CLYDE
THAT AIN'T MY FUCKIN' GUN!

And Clyde is moving toward the gun. And the Bailiff and
GUARDS

are moving toward Clyde. And Helen is moving out of the
way.
And the Judge is standing, banging her gavel. And the
jury
is scared.

CLYDE
YOU'RE TRYIN' TO FUCKIN' FRAME ME!

Clyde grabs for the gun as the bailiff and guards grab
for
Clyde. Clyde turns and decks the bailiff and all hell
breaks
lose.

CLYDE
IT AIN'T MY FUCKIN' GUN!


CUT TO:

INT. MEN'S ROOM - DAY

Door slams open. Rodriguez and Divinci enter. Rodriguez quickly checks all the stalls as Divinci closes the

door.

They are alone. When Rodriguez finishes with the stalls
--

RODRIGUEZ

We gotta put the right gun back.
 
DIVINCI

We can't put the right gun back!
Without that gun, they won't convict
Joe.

RODRIGUEZ

Without that gun they won't convict
Clyde!

DIVINCI
I'm not worried about Clyde, I'm
worried about us!

RODRIGUEZ

Look, Joe's never goin' to trial, right. He signed a goddamn confession! Like you said, this one is open and shut. Clyde's the one we gotta worry about. We can't let him go back on the street! He's a fuckin' psychopath. He'll kill somebody again.

DIVINCI

Shit. How the hell did that piece of puke know it wasn't his fuckin' gun?! I don't think he knows his own fuckin' mother, but he knows his fuckin' gun!


RODRIGUEZ

I don't think that's important right now.


CUT TO:

INT. EVIDENCE ROOM - DAY

The harried Desk Officer is filling out his usual paper
work
when Divinci and Rodriguez approach. Divinci knocks on
the

door. The desk officer looks up. He's had a tough day.

DESK OFFICER

Sorry, Divinci, can't do it.

DIVINCI
What d'you mean you can't do it? I
gotta check something.

DESK OFFICER
 
You gotta get written permission

from the Chief.

RODRIGUEZ
Since when?!

DESK OFFICER

Since an hour ago when he came down
here and chewed me a new asshole
bigger than a three car garage.

DIVINCI

What's the problem?

DESK OFFICER

Something about missing evidence or
who the hell knows. I just wanna
transfer the hell outa here.

DIVINCI

What the hell're we supposed to do?!

DESK OFFICER
Ask the chief. Policy ain't my
department!


CUT TO:

INT. SMALL COURTROOM - DAY

Joe's preliminary trial. Joe is seated at the defense
table
with Elliot. ANOTHER JUDGE, JUDGE HAROLD PINE, is
behind the
bench. No jury. This is a preliminary hearing to
determine
if there's enough evidence for Joe to stand trail.
Elliot is
shuffling papers in preparation for his opening.

And at the prosecution table is a very tired Helen. She

looks
completely pissed off and worn out. In no mood for
anything
to go wrong.

JUDGE HAROLD PINE
Whenever you're ready.

Elliot stands.
 
ELLIOT

We would like to plead not guilty to the charge of murder at this time for reason of Insanity.

Helen gives Elliot a look. She doesn't need this.

WILLIAM

But I did it.

Elliot turns to Joe.

ELLIOT

Yes, Joe. Let me handle this.

WILLIAM
But I signed the confession.

ELLIOT

Yes, Joe. Don't worry about it. I'm
the attorney.

HELEN
Your honor, can we have a moment?

JUDGE HAROLD PINE

Council may approach the bench.

Helen and Elliot cross to the bench.

HELEN

Your honor, my colleague's client
admits to the killing. I don't see
any reason to go through a trial
when it's obvious he would like to
plead guilty.

ELLIOT

I don't agree.

HELEN
If he wants to plead guilty, you
have to let him plead guilty.

ELLIOT

Not if he's not of sound mind.

HELEN
Come on, Elliot!

ELLIOT

I think he's crazy. I know you think
 

he's just putting it on, that's D.A. standard procedure, but I don't think he is. So, your honor, I'm standing by the not guilty because I believe he's incapable of making that judgment.

JUDGE HAROLD PINE

Have you had a psychiatrist look at
him?

ELLIOT

Yes, your honor.
(hands him papers)

I think you'll see that my diagnosis is not without warrant.

The judge hesitates, then looks at Joe. Joe is staring
at
him.

JUDGE HAROLD PINE

I'll review the findings and make my decision tomorrow.

ELLIOT

Thank you, your honor.
(to Helen)

Besides, I hear there's a good chance of beating the charges for lack of evidence.

Helen's look turns icy.


CUT TO:

INT. ETHNIC BAR/RESTAURANT - DAY

Dark, smoky. Not a place for the health-conscious.
Rodriguez
and Divinci at a corner booth. Both with scotch and

waters.
