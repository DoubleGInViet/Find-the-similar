DIVINCI

Nobody can connect us to the evidence thing... we're clean there.

Rodriguez is quiet.

DIVINCI

The most important one is this DEA
 
mess anyway. Once that's finished,

we're completely in the clear.

RODRIGUEZ
You know we can't do it anymore.

DIVINCI

...yeah, I guess.

RODRIGUEZ
No, we're through. That's it.

DIVINCI

Good while it lasted though. A hundred grand apiece. Not bad for a few nights work.

Divinci lifts his glass in a toast to himself, drinks.

RODRIGUEZ

I just wanna get through this.

DIVINCI
We're gonna get through it. No
evidence problems on this one.

RODRIGUEZ

I hope not... I don't know, Frank, lately I been thinkin'... maybe what we did wasn't such a good idea.

DIVINCI

Hey, we took out a few scumbags, that's it. Nobody's ever gonna miss those shitheels. They were all pieces of garbage. Not one of 'em had a sheet less than a mile long. Drugs, extortion, assault. They were all fuckin' guilty as hell and still on the street, you know that.

RODRIGUEZ

Except the cop.

DIVINCI

Yeah, except the cop. That's part of the job. Could just as easily have happened to you or me.

RODRIGUEZ

But we're cops, you know? We fucked
up.
 

DIVINCI

We fucked up once. Once outa ten.
That's not bad.
(a beat)

I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry. He was in the wrong place at the wrong time, what can I say. I'm not goin' down for it.

RODRIGUEZ

I know.

DIVINCI

Look, if we got paid a decent salary we wouldn't be tempted by this, right? And what happens when we retire? You think our pension's gonna take care of us? Shit no. We are on our own. I mean all I want in life is a goddamn fishing boat, a beach, a couple drinks and some Hawaiian fuckin' music.

That ain't much for twenty years putting murdering assholes behind bars. I mean, the dealers, the pimps, the killers, they got no rules. We got all the fuckin' rules. It ain't fair. That's all I'm sayin', it ain't fair... For awhile, we made it fair.

Rodriguez downs his scotch.

DIVINCI

Quit thinkin' you're a bad guy. You're not a fuckin' bad guy. You made one mistake. Let it go.

Rodriguez nods. A WAITRESS comes to the table.
Rodriguez
orders another. The Waitress leaves. Rodriguez
hesitates a
moment, then --

RODRIGUEZ

Do you think we're corrupt?

DIVINCI

Hey, I never took a fuckin' bribe in my life.

RODRIGUEZ

Me either.
 

DIVINCI

Nobody ever bought me.

RODRIGUEZ

I know.

DIVINCI

No fuckin' way. Even the thought makes me sick. And what we did has nothing to do with being corrupt. It's two completely different things. Don't get 'em confused.

RODRIGUEZ

I guess you're right.

DIVINCI

I'm telling you. It's nothin' to do
with corrupt.

RODRIGUEZ

I'm worried, that's all.

DIVINCI

Hey, you gotta worry a little. It's
natural. Just don't lose your sense
of humor.

RODRIGUEZ

My sense of humor, right.

DIVINCI

The problem with people is, nobody gives a shit about makin' the world a better place. You and me, I don't care what anybody says, we made the world a better place. No matter what happens. There are ten less drug dealin' assholes on the street today because of us. They're not plea bargainin' their way back onto the street, they're not clogging up the courts, and they're not costing the tax payers a fuckin' penny because they're not in prison. They were garbage. And there's nothin' wrong with takin' out the garbage.

Divinci downs his scotch. Rodriguez nods, then --

RODRIGUEZ
 
So, you think you'll get back with

Caroline?

DIVINCI
Shit. Nothin' I ever do is good
enough, you know?

RODRIGUEZ

Never is, never was, never will be.

DIVINCI

Guess I gotta make the effort. It's
gonna cost me if I don't.

RODRIGUEZ

Tell me about it. You know how much
I got left.

DIVINCI

You're gonna think I'm an idiot,
but... I like Cynthia. There's no
bullshit with her. I just fuckin'
like her.

RODRIGUEZ

I think you just like fuckin' her.

Rodriguez smiles. Divinci looks at him for a beat, then
--

DIVINCI

Yeah, that, too.


CUT TO:

NEWSPAPER - INT. CYNTHIA'S APARTMENT - DAY

with JOE'S PHOTOGRAPH on the front page. HEADLINE:
UNDERCOVER

COP GUNNED DOWN BY UNDERCOVER KILLER. We PAN AROUND to Cynthia, sitting in her kitchen, staring at the

photograph.

CYNTHIA

What the hell, Joe, at least you
won't get run over.

She folds up the paper and throws it in the trash can.
 


CUT TO:
 

INT. SMALL COURTROOM - DAY

The Dunner trial. The JURY is back. Helen, Judge
Weinberg,

waiting for
the verdict.

JUDGE WEINBERG

The defendant will stand and face
the jury.

Clyde stands.

JUDGE

What is your verdict?

JURY FOREMAN

We find the defendant, Clyde David
Dunner, not guilty.

Fuckin' A!


CUT TO:

INT. HOMICIDE DIVISION - DAY

Divinci is on the phone.

DIVINCI

--	when was the last time you saw him? -- Uh-huh -- And you haven't seen him since then?

Rodriguez suddenly strides up. He looks panicked.

RODRIGUEZ

We gotta talk.

DIVINCI

(into phone)
Just a second.
(covers phone)
Calm down. I heard. Clyde walked.
 
RODRIGUEZ

No!
(leans in close)
They're takin' Joe to trial.

Divinci stares at Rodriguez for a beat, the reality of
his
statement taking a moment to fully slam home.

RODRIGUEZ
They found him mentally unable to
plead so his attorney pleaded not
guilty by reason of insanity.

DIVINCI

You gotta be kiddin' me.

RODRIGUEZ

Yeah, that's me, I love to make people laugh. You hear the one about the two cops who popped the undercover
DEA?


CUT TO:

INT. STRIP JOINT - NIGHT

Cynthia on stage, in the middle of her routine. Hoots
and

whistles from the all MALE CROWD. But she's not really
into

her performance tonight. She pulls off the last of her clothing to APPLAUSE and CHEERS.

INT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

Cynthia enters. An ASIAN MAN in sweat shirt and jeans
is
sitting in the room.

CYNTHIA

Who the hell're you and what the
fuck are you doing in here?!
(calls down hall)
HEY, BOB, I GOT AN ASSHOLE IN THE
DRESSING ROOM.

(to the man)

I suggest you get out before Bob gets here. He doesn't like assholes.

ASIAN MAN
 
You're Cynthia Webb.

CYNTHIA

(calls down hall)
BOB!

The Asian Man stands.

ASIAN MAN

But you are Cynthia Webb the famous
dancer, yes?

CYNTHIA

Yeah, yeah, nice try, get out.

The man moves toward her, pulling a PAPER from his
pocket.
He hands it to her.

ASIAN MAN

I liked your show very much.

CYNTHIA
What the hell's this?!

He exits. No answer. Cynthia stares at the paper --

CYNTHIA

A subpoena?! For what?! I didn't do
anything!

But the man is gone. BOB, a HUGE BOUNCER, tears past,
giving
chase.

CYNTHIA

(staring at paper)

Oh shit... oh shit. He served me! He fuckin' served me!


CUT TO:

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

Dark, quiet. PHONE RINGS. A hand picks up the phone.

MAN'S VOICE
Hello.

ANOTHER MAN'S VOICE

Detective Divinci?
 

DIVINCI

Yeah.

ANOTHER MAN'S VOICE This is Sergeant Gardner down at the station.

INTERCUT WITH SERGEANT - INT. HOMICIDE DIVISION - NIGHT

The station is alive with activity. Even at this early
hour.
HOOKERS, PIMPS, PUSHERS, DRUNK DRIVERS. Some being
booked,
some being released, some being obnoxious.

SERGEANT GARDNER

Sorry to call so late, but I got a hysterical woman here says she needs to talk to you about a murder.

Divinci turns on the light revealing a WOMAN in bed
with
him. He picks up his watch, looks at the time.

SERGEANT GARDNER

I told her I couldn't call you at
home, but she said that it was very
important. A matter of, you know,
life and death.

DIVINCI

What's her name?

SERGEANT GARDNER
Cynthia.

Divinci perks up at the name.

And now we SEE Cynthia in the POLICE STATION trying not
to

look as freaked out as she feels. But she's not holding together well.

DIVINCI

Tell her to wait, I'll be right down.

Divinci hangs up. Starts to dress. The woman groans.

WOMAN

What the hell're you doing?
 
DIVINCI

I gotta go down to the station.

WOMAN
Now? What time is it?

DIVINCI

Go back to sleep.

WOMAN
Frank, this is no way to repair our
marriage, you know?

She pulls the covers over her head. Divinci pulls on
his

pants.


CUT TO:

INT. POLICE STATION - 3:38 A.M.

Divinci pushes into the room. Sees Cynthia sitting on
the
bench, looking nervous as hell. Smoking, tapping her
foot,
looking around. Just this side of a wreck.

DIVINCI
Hey!

Cynthia sees him and is immediately on her feet, moving
to
him.

CYNTHIA

Frank, I can't do this. He came to
the club. You gotta --

DIVINCI

Not here!

He takes her arm, leads her out of the station.

INT. POLICE STATION PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT

Divinci leads Cynthia out of the station to his car.

CYNTHIA

I thought you said all I had to do
was pick him out?! That's what you
said, that's all I had to do. I did
 

what you said. But that was supposed to be all.

DIVINCI
SHUT UP!

He opens the driver's door, pushes her in. Gets in
behind
her.

INT. UNMARKED CAR - NIGHT

Cynthia is a bundle of nerves. Divinci slams the door.
Cynthia
is startled by the suddenness of his anger.

DIVINCI

What're you talkin' about?

Cynthia opens her purse and pulls out the subpoena.

CYNTHIA

They want me in court.

Divinci glances at the papers.

CYNTHIA

You promised me I wasn't gonna have
to do anything! What the hell is
goin' on?!

This is yet another glitch that Divinci hadn't counted
on.

CYNTHIA
I can't do this, Frank. I can't go
into court. I'm gettin' outa here!

DIVINCI

You are not getting outa here!

CYNTHIA

Well I can't go to court! THAT'S NOT
WHAT YOU SAID I'D HAVE TO DO!

DIVINCI
WELL THIS WASN'T SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN!
NOW JUST FUCKIN' CALM DOWN FOR A
SECOND AND LET ME THINK!

Cynthia glares at him, then turns away, takes a drag
and
 
blows out the smoke.

CYNTHIA

Fine. Think away.

Divinci hesitates as ANOTHER CAR pulls out. Then turns
to
her.

DIVINCI
Look, you're a witness, that's all.
You got nothin' to worry about. You
saw something happen --

CYNTHIA

-- What?! What did I see?!

DIVINCI

I will tell you everything you gotta know. You understand? Everything. You will know exactly what to say.

Cynthia looks at Divinci, unsure. Divinci gives her a confident smile. Look, it's another stage, that's all.

Just
like dancin'.

THE UNMARKED CAR

pulls quickly out of the PARKING GARAGE.


CUT TO:

INT. JAIL - MEETING ROOM - DAY

Elliot is waiting. The guard opens the door and Joe
enters.

Joe is looking better. Getting him off booze has helped immensely.

ELLIOT

Hi, Joe. You're looking much better.

WILLIAM

I guess jail's been good for me.

Elliot nods, motions for Joe to take a chair.

ELLIOT

Trial date's been set for Thursday.
 
WILLIAM

I've been thinking about what I did...
and I don't think it's right that I
try getting off.

ELLIOT

Excuse me?

WILLIAM

I want to plead guilty. I killed a
man and I should be punished.

ELLIOT

...I'm a little surprised.

WILLIAM
Why?

ELLIOT

Nobody ever wants to be punished for what they've done. It's just a new concept. But I still think our defense is reasonable. I don't believe, under the condition you were in, that you were responsible for your actions.

WILLIAM

But why was I carrying a gun? I had
no right to carry a gun.

ELLIOT

If you hadn't been carrying the gun, you might be dead.

WILLIAM
And he might be alive.

ELLIOT

I understand... Can I think about
this?

WILLIAM

No. I've made up my mind.

Elliot stares at Joe for a beat, then we --


CUT TO:

YELLOW CRIME SCENE TAPE - EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
 
TWO MURDER VICTIMS lying in the street. POLICE OFFICERS

have
the area under control. A few CURIOUS PEOPLE have
stopped to
watch. An UNMARKED CAR pulls up. Stops.

INT. UNMARKED CAR - DAY

Parked. Rodriguez behind the wheel. Divinci next to
him.

RODRIGUEZ

What if she takes off?

DIVINCI

Then we got no goddamn witness puts
him at the scene.

RODRIGUEZ

And what happens if she testifies
and nobody fuckin' believes her?

DIVINCI
Perjury, maybe. But that's a fifty
fifty. They might believe her.

RODRIGUEZ

Shit, Frank, she's a goddamn stripper for Chrissake, who's gonna believe her. I don't believe her when she's telling the truth!

An OFFICER walks to the car and knocks on the window.
Divinci
rolls it down.

DIVINCI

What?

OFFICER

Ahh, we got two bodies out here and
three more in the house.

DIVINCI

So?

OFFICER

I was just wondering if you were
gonna be the primary on this one,
that's all.

DIVINCI
 
Yeah, yeah, we're comin'. Just give

us some room.

Divinci rolls the window back up. The officer backs
off.

RODRIGUEZ

She could blow the whole thing. She
could tie us in and that would be
it. We'd be fuckin' fried.

DIVINCI

If it looks like she's gonna crumble we'll take steps.

RODRIGUEZ
What steps?

Divinci looks at Rodriguez.

DIVINCI

One more chalk outline more or less
in this city who's gonna know?

RODRIGUEZ

Oh shit, Frank.

DIVINCI

Hey, hey, you think I like this?!

RODRIGUEZ

We just can't go around killin'
everybody!

DIVINCI
Just a second. Look around. Whatta

we got here? Two stiffs on the street, shot to shit, three more inside. That's five chalk lines in one night in one deal in one neighborhood in one city. Let me fill you in on some statistics, we're not killin' everybody.

(a beat, then --)

Look, this is strictly last resort. Okay? But let's not kid ourselves. If push comes to shove, somebody has to go down. If you got another candidate, I'm willin' to listen.

Rodriguez is silent. Divinci opens the door. Rodriguez
watches
 
him, then he follows. To the scene of another crime.


CUT TO:

INT. CYNTHIA'S APARTMENT - DAY

Cynthia is in the kitchen, making herself a peanut
butter

and jelly sandwich as she watches Sally Jesse Raphael interview yet another moron on television. The phone

rings.
She takes a bite of the sandwich as she picks up and
mumbles --

CYNTHIA
Hello.

INTERCUT WITH INT. OFFICE - D.A.'S DEPARTMENT - DAY

Richard Stein, the attorney, is on the phone. His
office is
cluttered with the myriad of case files he's forced to
juggle.

RICHARD STEIN

Cynthia Webb?

CYNTHIA
(swallows)
...yeah.

RICHARD STEIN

I'm Richard Stein with the District
Attorney's office. You're a witness
in a case we're handling and I'd
like to talk to you as soon as
possible.

Cynthia puts down the sandwich, her appetite suddenly
gone.

RICHARD STEIN

Ms Webb?

CYNTHIA

Yeah.

RICHARD STEIN

Any chance we could get together
today?
 
CYNTHIA

(nervous)
I'm ah... pretty busy.

RICHARD STEIN

It won't take long. Will you be home about two?
(no answer)
Ms Webb?

CYNTHIA

Yeah, okay... two.

RICHARD STEIN

Good. Let me make sure I've got your correct address.


CUT TO:

SUITCASE - INT. CYNTHIA'S BEDROOM - DAY

shut.
And Cynthia heads for the door.


CUT TO:

EXT. MANSION - DAY

A BLACK CONVERTIBLE MERCEDES pulls into the circular,
gated

drive of the large two story home on immense manicured grounds. A BMW is parked in front of the FOUR CAR
GARAGE. It
is being waxed by car care specialists. The Mercedes
stops
and a MAN gets out. He has gray hair and expensive
clothes.
He carries a briefcase and heads for the front door.
His

name is ARTHUR BAYLOR.

EXT. MANSION - PATIO - DAY

A BUTLER shows Arthur to the patio where another MAN,
NATHAN
MCCALL, is seated behind a table, reviewing documents.
McCall
is fifty-five, wears glasses.
 
BUTLER

Mr. Baylor is here.

McCall looks up, smiles.

WILLIAM

Arthur.

Arthur crosses. The two men shake hands.

ARTHUR

Nathan. How are you?

WILLIAM

Good, Arthur, thanks. Would you like some coffee, juice.

ARTHUR

No, I'm fine.

WILLIAM

Well, this is all a bit of a mystery. You certainly got my attention with your phone call. What's this all about?

Arthur removes a NEWSPAPER from his briefcase. Opens
it.
Revealing the PHOTOGRAPH OF JOE and the headline:
UNDERCOVER

COP GUNNED DOWN BY UNDERCOVER KILLER. McCall looks at
the
paper.

WILLIAM
Is there something you want me to
see?

Arthur points at the photograph. McCall looks. A beat,
then --

WILLIAM

Oh my God.


CUT TO:

INT. BUS STATION - DAY

Cynthia boards a greyhound. Getting the hell out of
Dodge.
 

CUT TO:

INT. CYNTHIA'S APARTMENT - DAY

We HEAR a key in the lock. The door opens and Divinci
enters.
He looks around.

DIVINCI
Cynthia.

He moves into the bedroom. Sees clothes strewn around
and a
half empty closet.

DIVINCI

Shit!

He heads back into the living room. Pulls open the door
and
almost runs into Richard Stein who was just about to
knock.

DIVINCI

(startled)
Jesus!

Richard Stein is just as startled and it takes him a
moment

to recognize --

RICHARD STEIN

Divinci?

Divinci is caught off guard.

RICHARD STEIN

Richard Stein, D.A.'s office.

DIVINCI
Oh, yeah, sorry. I didn't expect --
what're you doing here?

RICHARD STEIN

I have to talk with Cynthia Webb. A witness in -- well, wait, aren't you and Detective Rodriguez on this one?

DIVINCI

(vamping)
Yeah, yeah, that's why I'm here. I
 
wanted to go over some of the details.

RICHARD STEIN

Me, too. Is she there?

DIVINCI

No.

RICHARD STEIN

I was supposed to meet her at two.
(looks at watch)
Do you know her?

DIVINCI

What d'you mean?

RICHARD STEIN

Well, I just mean, if she's not
here... you were...
(a little awkward)
...inside.

DIVINCI
(forces a smile)

Oh, yeah, the legal thing. Well, she's a witness in a murder case. And when they don't answer a knock and the door's open, it's my experience, you know. I like to make sure there's no dead bodies layin' around.

(pulls door shut)
Don't tell on me.

RICHARD STEIN

No, no, of course not... Well, maybe I should wait. She might be stuck in traffic or something.

DIVINCI

Yeah. If she shows up, let me know.
I'd like to talk to her, too.

RICHARD STEIN

Of course.

Divinci looks at Stein for a beat, then smiles and --

DIVINCI

See you in court.

RICHARD STEIN
 
Right.

Divinci heads down the walkway. Richard Stein watches
him
for a moment, then looks at the closed door, then at
his
watch.


CUT TO:

INT. ELLIOT'S OFFICE - DAY

Elliot's office is a cramped space in the PUBLIC
DEFENDERS

FLOOR of the CRIMINAL COURTS BUILDING. A buzz of
activity

outside. The staff is overworked, underpaid and underappreciated. Elliot is reviewing legal documents.
Knock
on the door.

ELLIOT
Yeah.

The door opens and Arthur Baylor enters.

ARTHUR

Elliot Goff?

Elliot looks up and suddenly recognizes --

ELLIOT

Arthur Baylor?

ARTHUR

Yes.

Elliot is stunned and flattered. He stands quickly.

ELLIOT

Arthur Baylor, oh my God. I ahh, would you ahh... are you here to see me?

ARTHUR

Yes.

Arthur shuts the door.
 


CUT TO:
 

INT. JAIL - INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

Door opens. Joe is lead into the room by the JAIL
GUARD. Joe

looks even better now. His stay in jail has broken his dependency on alcohol. His hair is clean and combed.

And
he's not as depressed. He stops upon seeing Elliot and
Arthur

at the table. Both men stand. The guard shuts the door.
Arthur
looks at Joe for a moment, then says --

ARTHUR

William.

Joe stares at Arthur as if fighting a lost memory, then
--

WILLIAM

...yes.


CUT TO:

INT. DISTRICT ATTORNEY - HELEN'S OFFICE - DAY

HELEN
What are you telling me?!

Richard Stein is facing a not very happy Helen. She is
seated
behind her desk stacked high with case files.

HELEN

She missed the appointment? She forget you were coming? What?!

RICHARD STEIN

If you want my best guess, I'd say
she split.

HELEN

She split, our witness split... Can't we keep our evidence and witnesses from disappearing around here? I mean what do I have to do, lock them in the trunk of my car? What the fuck is going on?! I want that bitch back here and on the stand or in jail!
 

Richard Stein nods quickly.

RICHARD STEIN
I'll get her.

And he exits fast. He doesn't like it when his boss is
pissed.
And right now his boss is really pissed.


CUT TO:

EXT. BAIL BOND OFFICE - DAY

A seedy side street near the courthouse and jail. The
unmarked
car pulls up and Divinci gets out.

INT. BAIL BOND OFFICE - DAY

The interior is sparse. Several FRAMED FIGHT POSTERS on
the
walls. All with MANNY LADREW, a young tough fighter in
the
featherweight division, in his best pose, explaining
where
and when the next bout will be -- but all these posters
are
at least fifteen years old.

Two desks. One for the secretary, who is on vacation,
and
the other for MANNY LADREW, the ex-pugilist. He's put
on
some pounds in the intervening years, plus an added
thin
mustache. Manny is on the phone --

MANNY

--	yeah, uh-huh. (takes notes)

Why you think he'd go there?

Divinci enters.

DIVINCI

We need to talk.

MANNY

(covers phone)
Just a second.
 

DIVINCI

Not just a second, now!

Manny glares at Divinci. He doesn't like Divinci, never
has,

never will. But he's a cop. Cop's you have to make room
for.

MANNY
(into phone)
I'll call you back.
(hangs up)
What d'you want, Divinci?

Divinci pulls some papers out of his pocket, hands them
to
Manny.

DIVINCI

I got a witness who took off. I gotta get her back. I don't got a lotta time.

MANNY

You're the fuckin' police. What're
you comin' to me for?!

DIVINCI
Don't ask fuckin' questions, you
just find her!

Manny, annoyed, looks at the papers -- photo of Cynthia included.

MANNY

Where've I seen her before?

DIVINCI

She dances.

MANNY

Yeah, right, okay. So what'd she
take off for?

DIVINCI

I said --

MANNY

--	I know what you fuckin' said, but you want me to find her I gotta know why the fuck she took off! So I know
 
where not to look! Okay?!

DIVINCI

...she's supposed to testify. She
got scared, thinks somebody might
kill her, so she's hidin'. That's
why I want you to find her. If
somebody is tryin' to pop her, I
don't want anyone knowin' where she
is. Manny eyes Divinci. He doesn't
believe anything anybody tells him.
Especially in his business.

MANNY

How long I got?

DIVINCI

Two days.

MANNY

Shit, two fuckin' days!

DIVINCI
Find her, puss head.

Divinci glares at Manny, then exits. Manny watches him
leave.

MANNY

Sure, Detective. Always like to help out the police whenever possible!


CUT TO:

INT. LARGE COURTROOM - DAY

Joe (William) is lead into the courtroom by GUARDS.
Takes
his place at the DEFENSE TABLE which includes Elliot
and TWO
YOUNG ATTORNEYS. The PROSECUTION TABLE, which includes

Richard
Stein and Helen is going over last minute minutia.

PEOPLE are taking seats in the gallery. But another
attorney
joins the Defense table. It's Arthur Baylor. And
Richard
Stein double-takes when he sees him.

AT THE PROSECUTION TABLE
 

RICHARD STEIN

(to Helen)
Isn't that Arthur Baylor?

Helen turns.

HELEN

Yes.

They watch Arthur shake hands with everyone - Elliot,
the
two young attorneys and Joe.

RICHARD STEIN

What's he doing here?

Arthur takes a seat at the defense table and glances
across
at Helen and Richard and nods. Helen and Richard are
stunned.

HELEN
What the hell?

BAILIFF

Hear ye, hear ye. All rise, face our flag and recognize the principles for which it stands. The Criminal Court, Department G is now in session. The Honorable Harold W. Pine presiding.


Everyone rises as JUDGE HAROLD PINE enters. In black
robe.
Taking his place behind the bench. He sits.

BAILIFF

Please be seated and come to order.

Everyone sits. And even Judge Harold Pine double-takes
when

he sees Arthur Baylor at the Defense table.

BAILIFF

The People versus Joe Doe in case
number 95-24705.

JUDGE HAROLD PINE

Before we proceed, I'd like to ask the Defense if there's anything this court should be made aware of.
 

Arthur stands.

ARTHUR

Yes, your honor. I have joined the defense in the representation of Mr. William Dane McCall, otherwise known to this court as Joe Doe.

Everyone turns to look at Joe (William McCall). CAMERA
PUSHES
in on him. It doesn't look as if he's sure who he is
yet.

ARTHUR

I have represented the McCall family for several years before William McCall's disappearance seven years ago. It was assumed that he had died, but since he has reappeared under these tragic circumstances, I would ask this court for a continuance to allow the defense to prepare adequately in light of his real identity now being known.

JUDGE HAROLD PINE

How long do you need.

ARTHUR

One week should be sufficient.

JUDGE HAROLD PINE

Any objection to a week's continuance by the State?

HELEN

I don't... believe so, your honor.

JUDGE HAROLD PINE

Then I grant a one week continuance.
We will start the proceedings next

Monday morning.

Judge Harold Pine taps his gavel.

TELEVISION NEWS REPORTS - INT. HELEN'S OFFICE - DAY
 
FLASH Joe's photograph and scenes of him being lead

from the
courtroom. Helen and Richard Stein are watching. They
can't
believe it.

NEWSCASTER

--	when it was discovered that the man who has confessed to killing an undercover DEA agent, was actually himself thought dead for seven years. The man who signed the confession as Joe Doe is actually William Dane McCall, brother of Nathan McCall. Both are sons of the founder of McCall International, a corporation involved in telecommunications, computer design and development and other related industries. The net worth of both men is estimated at over a billion dollars --


CUT TO:

INT. UNMARKED CAR - DAY

Parked on the street. Rodriguez and Divinci inside.
Rodriguez
reads the paper.

RODRIGUEZ

--	but William McCall shunned the business world and turned his life to medicine, receiving his medical degree from Harvard in 1969. Once again he turned his back on the established norm and spent several years in Africa performing organ transplants for the poor.

Rodriguez slams down the paper.

RODRIGUEZ

Jesus Christ, this is who you picked? A goddamn surgeon who performs organ transplants on poor Africans?!

DIVINCI

He was living in the fuckin' street! How the hell was I supposed to know he was a goddamn doctor?!
 

RODRIGUEZ

He's not a goddamn doctor! You picked a fuckin' Saint to pin a fuckin' murder on!

Divinci grabs the paper away from him. Both cops are
angry,
upset, frustrated and scared to death.

RODRIGUEZ

When we pick 'em, we really fuckin'
pick 'em. We shoulda just picked up
the fuckin' Pope.

DIVINCI
(reading)

--	he disappeared seven years ago on September 19 two weeks after the tragic death of his wife and two young children in a multiple vehicle accident. At the time it was assumed that he had returned to Africa, but that was never confirmed. What William McCall has been doing for seven years is now the mystery that the court will try to help unravel.

Divinci closes the paper.

DIVINCI

Alright, alright, let's think here.
What's the worse case scenario?

RODRIGUEZ
Are you asking me if I can think of
something worse than what we've done
that we can still do, or something
worse that might happen to us if
this all blows up and we are convicted
and sent to jail and die in the
electric chair and go to hell?

Divinci looks at Rodriguez.

DIVINCI

Work with me here.

RODRIGUEZ

I'm sorry. I'm a little on edge.
Would you repeat the question?
 
Both men are quiet for a moment, then --

DIVINCI

Even if the doc walks, there's no evidence ties us to it. There's only one person who can connect us to Hudd.

RODRIGUEZ

Okay, fine, I don't wanna argue about it anymore. Let's just fuckin' kill her.


CUT TO:

INT. BALL BOND OFFICE - DAY (LATE AFTERNOON)

Manny LaDrew is pouring himself a cup of coffee. His
SECRETARY
is typing up a letter at her desk.

DIVINCI'S VOICE
We need to talk.

Manny recognizes the voice. He mouths an oh fuck to
himself,
then turns around to Divinci who is standing in the
doorway.

MANNY

Are you fuckin' with me?

DIVINCI

No, I'm not fuckin' with you. Are
you fuckin' with me?!

MANNY

You don't know?

DIVINCI
Know what?

MANNY

Well this is a good one. You're a
cop and you don't know.

DIVINCI
Stop it.

MANNY

Cops got her. Ain't that a gas. Cops
 

got her, you're a cop, and you gotta find out from me. It's a crazy world we live in, don't you think?

Divinci suddenly explodes, going for Manny, grabbing
him,
slamming him against the wall, his arm to Manny's
throat.

DIVINCI
Cops?! What fuckin' cops?!

MANNY

I don't know what fuckin' cops. All I know is, my people got to her sister's place and she was already gone. Her sister said some cops took her. I thought it was you!

Divinci glares at Manny for a beat, then he storms out.

SECRETARY

What an asshole.

Manny looks down at his Secretary.

MANNY

You're a good judge of character.


CUT TO:

DIVINCI - INT. HOMICIDE DIVISION - DUSK

at his desk, on the phone.

DIVINCI

--	look, she's our witness, if she's in custody, somebody better tell me!

Divinci slams down the phone. He sits quietly for a
moment,

then rubs his face. Rodriguez crosses to his desk, sits
down.

DIVINCI

Anything?

RODRIGUEZ

Nothin'. Nobody knows nothin'. The D.A. thinks she's gone. D.E.A. doesn't know shit.
 

DIVINCI

If she was bein' held by police,
we'd know.

RODRIGUEZ

Unless she said somethin'.

DIVINCI

If she said something we wouldn't be sittin' here.

(a beat, then --)
I think it's that lyin' piece of
shit.


CUT TO:

MANNY - INT. BALL BONDS OFFICE - NIGHT

getting the shit beat out of him. The room is dark. Two
men
are hammering on Manny. Throwing him against the wall,
pulling
him up and hitting him in the stomach -- not the face.
Throwing him across the room, over the desk. Manny is
too
hurt to get up. Divinci walks over to him, rubbing his
gloved
hand.

DIVINCI

Don't ever lie to me again.

Manny looks up weakly. Divinci walks away. Rodriguez
opens
the door and they exit.


CUT TO:

INT. COUNTY JAIL CELL - MORNING

Joe is sitting on his cot, staring at the floor.
ANOTHER MAN
is in the cell with him, reading a magazine. His name
is
DUNCAN. Duncan looks at Joe.

DUNCAN

First trial, huh.
 
WILLIAM

Yes.

DUNCAN
I got one piece of advise. When you
break for lunch, don't get the
pastrami.

We HEAR the BARRED CELL DOOR open.

GUARD

Time to go.

Joe gets up. Puts out his hands. They shackle him as we
HEAR --

THE BAILIFF'S VOICE

Hear ye, hear ye. All rise, face our flag and recognize the principles for which it stands.

INT. COUNTY JAIL CELL - HALLWAY - MORNING

Joe is lead down the hall by TWO GUARDS, past rows of
cells
filled with other PRISONERS --

BAILIFF'S VOICE

The Criminal Court, Department G is now in session. The Honorable Harold W. Pine presiding.

(We HEAR people rise)
Please be seated and come to order.

EXT. COUNTY JAIL - PARKING AREA - DAY

Joe is lead to a waiting prison van. He gets inside.

BAILIFF'S VOICE

The People versus William McCall in
case number 95-24705.

The van pulls away.


CUT TO:

THE .44 SMITH AND WESSON (CLYDE'S .44)

as it is introduced into evidence.

HELEN
 

--	when he pulled this gun and fired at the driver of the car. Killing him instantly. Let the record show that this is the weapon used in the crime, a Smith and Wesson forty-four caliber handgun.

INT. LARGE COURTROOM - DAY

Joe is sitting at the Defense table with Arthur and
Elliot.

The trial is underway. And they watch the .44 go to the evidence table -- the .44 with the BLACK STAIN.

Richard Stein is seated at the Defense table. He, too,

is
watching the .44. He leans across to his ASSISTANT.

RICHARD STEIN

All these goddamn guns are startin'
to look the same to me.


DISSOLVE TO:

DIVINCI - INT. LARGE COURTROOM - LATER

on the stand, being questioned by Helen.

HELEN

And when you arrested the defendant, did he deny that he had killed Agent Hudd.

DIVINCI
No.

HELEN

Can you describe the defendant's condition at the time of his arrest.

DIVINCI

He was drunk. We could smell the
booze on him. But we drew blood. He
didn't object.

HELEN

We have the blood test report that
shows --
(picks up report)

--	that he had four times the legal limit to drive. The people would
 
like to enter this into evidence.

They so enter it.


CUT TO:

RODRIGUEZ - INT. LARGE COURTROOM - LATER

on the stand. Elliot is cross-examining.

ELLIOT

--	and you arrested the defendant four days after the killing. What lead you to suspect Mr. McCall?

RODRIGUEZ

You ask questions. Work the
neighborhood. Find out who was on
the street that night.

ELLIOT

Yes, but specifically Mr. McCall? He had no previous criminal record.

RODRIGUEZ

We found someone who'd seen him in the area. So we picked him up for questioning. We didn't expect it to be him. But if someone saw him in the area that night we would want to talk to him. If he wasn't the killer, he might've seen the killer. Just routine really.

ELLIOT

Where did you find the defendant?

RODRIGUEZ

On the street. Corner of Third and
Madison.

ELLIOT

What was he doing?

RODRIGUEZ

He was passed out.

ELLIOT

But you knew it was the man you were looking for.
 
RODRIGUEZ

Yes.

ELLIOT
Based on what?

RODRIGUEZ

His description.

ELLIOT
Who provided you with the description?

RODRIGUEZ

(hesitates a beat)
Cynthia something, I think.

Elliot moves to the defense table, glances at Arthur as
he

picks up a paper. Arthur nods approvingly. Elliot looks
at
the paper.

ELLIOT

I believe her name is Cynthia Webb. According to the statement filed the night she picked him out of the line-up. The name familiar?

RODRIGUEZ
Yes... that's her.

ELLIOT

Where did you find Ms Webb?

RODRIGUEZ
On the street. Same area.

ELLIOT

And she agreed to pick the defendant out of a line up.

RODRIGUEZ

Yes.

ELLIOT

Where you aware that Ms Webb
disappeared after she was served
with a subpoena?

RODRIGUEZ

Yes, my partner and I tried to contact her about the case and were
 
unsuccessful.

ELLIOT

Thank you, Detective, that's all the questions I have.

Rodriguez gets up as we --


CUT TO:

INT. ETHNIC BAR/RESTAURANT - NIGHT

A waitress cruises past tables to the booth in the
back. She

sets down two scotch and waters to the two men.
Rodriguez
and Divinci. The waitress exits. Divinci picks up his
glass.

DIVINCI

To justice in all its forms.

Rodriguez picks up his glass.

RODRIGUEZ

We're not home free yet.

DIVINCI

Without Ms Webb, there's no place they can go. We still got the confession, the gun, the ballistics...

And I don't give a shit about all this African doctor crap... the man is a drunk and he's been a drunk for seven goddamn years. So lets have a drink for drunks.

Rodriguez reluctantly lifts his glass. They clink and
drink.
