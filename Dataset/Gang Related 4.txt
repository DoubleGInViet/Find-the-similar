DIVINCI

That's the thing about life. You control it or it controls you. Most people don't understand that. They try'n blame their fuck-ups on something or somebody else. But it's not like that. I don't wanna hear why your life's a mess. It's a mess cause you're a mess. That simple. They're waitin' to live happily ever after. But after what? After all the
 

shit happens? Well, I got a clue for everybody, the shit never stops happening. So you deal with it or you get buried in it. I'm not talkin' about you, you know what I'm sayin' here.

RODRIGUEZ

Yeah.

DIVINCI

Life don't work in mysterious ways.
There ain't no mystery to it. You
just work it. And you don't take it
too serious. You can't take it too

serious otherwise you get fragile.
And you can't be fragile and have
any fuckin' fun.

RODRIGUEZ

You think I'm fragile?

DIVINCI
That's the first sign of trouble,
when you start askin' other people.

Rodriguez nods.

RODRIGUEZ

...I just wish I knew where the hell she was.


CUT TO:

INT. HELEN'S D.A. OFFICE - NIGHT

Helen and Richard Stein are working late. Over take-out Chinese.

RICHARD STEIN
(referring to papers)

--	so I think we'll have to rely on the confession for his description of what happened. He'll never take the stand, even if --

The phone rings. Richard picks up.

RICHARD STEIN

(into phone)
D.A.'s office... What?... When?...
 
Where will --

Richard is surprised. He turns to Helen.

RICHARD STEIN

They found Cynthia Webb.

HELEN

Where?

RICHARD STEIN

I don't know.

HELEN

When?

RICHARD STEIN

I don't know.

HELEN

Well who the hell was that?

RICHARD STEIN
I don't know. They hung up.

Richard hangs up the receiver. He and Helen exchange a
look.

HELEN
What the fuck is going on?!


CUT TO:

INT. LARGE COURTROOM - DAY

HELEN

Your honor, the people call Ms.
Cynthia Webb to the stand.

VARIOUS REACTIONS

Rodriguez and Divinci are stunned. Cynthia? Elliot is completely surprised. Cynthia? Arthur is never shaken
by
anything.

The courtroom doors open and Cynthia is lead down the
aisle
by a SHERIFF'S DEPUTY. She moves to the chair.
 
But it's Joe's turn to double take. He remembers her.

My
God, he knows her. It's Cynthia -- the girl from the
apartment
building. He never saw who pointed him out, but he
never
expected it to be her.

BAILIFF

Raise your right hand.

Cynthia raises her hand. But her look goes right to
Joe.
Staring at him. She's never seen Joe like this --
cleaned

up, trimmed, handsome. She's not sure she even
recognizes
him.

BAILIFF

You swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help you God.

She turns her eyes from Joe.

CYNTHIA

Sure.

BAILIFF

You may be seated.

Cynthia sits down. Looks at Divinci.

And Joe leans across to Arthur and Elliot. Their
conversation
is in whispers --

WILLIAM

I know her.

ELLIOT

She's the woman who identified you.

WILLIAM

No. I mean I know her.

ARTHUR
...How?

WILLIAM

I'm not sure... I think I lived near
 
her.

Arthur exchanges a look with Elliot. Arthur turns now
and
looks at Cynthia. The wheels are turning.

HELEN

Please state your name for the court.

CYNTHIA
Cynthia Webb.

HELEN

Do you see the man that you identified in a police line-up in this room.

CYNTHIA

Yes.

HELEN

Is it the defendant, Mr. McCall?

Cynthia looks at Joe. Joe looks straight at her.
Cynthia
turns her eyes away.

CYNTHIA

Yes.

HELEN

Please describe what you saw the
night of September 14th.

CYNTHIA

I was comin' out of an all night
minimart --


CUT TO:

EXT. STREET - MINI MART - NIGHT

Cynthia comes out of a ALL NIGHT MINI-MART with a bag
of

food. She walks down the street and suddenly we HEAR a GUNSHOT. Followed by a CAR CRASH. She turns toward the

sound.
And we HEAR RUNNING FOOTSTEPS. Then we see a man
running. He
has a pistol in one hand.

Cynthia watches the man run past and disappear into the
 
darkness.

CUT
BACK TO:

INT. LARGE COURTROOM - DAY

Cynthia is looking at Helen.

HELEN
And you're positive the man you saw
with the gun is the defendant.

Instead of looking at Joe, Cynthia turns to Rodriguez
and

Divinci who are seated in the rows behind the
prosecution

table. They are looking right at her. They wait for her answer.

CYNTHIA

Yeah.

HELEN

No further questions.

Divinci offers her a small smile.

Cynthia turns away. Arthur is now standing in front of
her.

ARTHUR

Miss Webb... is it Miss?

CYNTHIA
Yes.

ARTHUR

Miss Webb, had you ever seen the
defendant before that night, the
night you described to us?

CYNTHIA

No.

ARTHUR

Do you know what perjury is?

CYNTHIA

When you lie.

ARTHUR
 

When you lie under oath in a court of law. Do you know what the penalty for that is?

CYNTHIA

You go to jail.

ARTHUR

Yes... Cynthia, have you ever seen
the defendant before that night?

HELEN

Objection. The witness has already
answered that question.

JUDGE HAROLD PINE
Sustained.

ARTHUR

I just want to give the witness the opportunity to remember if she could have seen Mr. McCall anyplace else before the night in question.

Divinci stares at Cynthia. As if willing her to give
the
answer he wants her to give.

JUDGE HAROLD PINE
Ms. Webb, do you understand the
consequences of perjury?

CYNTHIA

Yes.

JUDGE HAROLD PINE

Let's get on with it then.

ARTHUR

What did you buy the night you went
into the mini-mart?

CYNTHIA

What did I buy?

ARTHUR

You remembered seeing Mr. McCall
that night and hearing the gunshot
and a car crash. I just wondered if
you remembered what you bought in
the mini-mart.
 
CYNTHIA

...shampoo I think.

ARTHUR
That's all?

CYNTHIA

Yes.

ARTHUR
Where do you live?

CYNTHIA

4356 17th Street. Number 37.

ARTHUR
Is that close to where this mini-
mart is?

CYNTHIA

Close? Sort of.

ARTHUR
How far would you say?

CYNTHIA

I don't really know.

ARTHUR
Within walking distance?

CYNTHIA

No... I don't think so.

ARTHUR
Did you walk there that night or
drive?

CYNTHIA

I ahh... drove.

ARTHUR

You drove. But when you left the mini-mart you stated that you walked down the street.

CYNTHIA

Yeah.

ARTHUR

How far?
 
CYNTHIA

...to the corner.

HELEN

Objection. Your honor, I don't see a point to this line of questioning.

JUDGE HAROLD PINE

Is there a point?

ARTHUR

Yes, your honor. Since this is the only witness, I'm trying to establish what the scene was like that night.

JUDGE HAROLD PINE
Try to get there as quickly as
possible.

ARTHUR

(to Cynthia)

And how far away from the corner was the Mini-mart? For example was it in the middle of the block, close to the corner, where?

CYNTHIA

In the middle I think.

ARTHUR

So you walked all the way to the corner. I assume then you were walking back to your car, yes?

CYNTHIA
...yeah.

ARTHUR

Was there a reason you parked so far away?

CYNTHIA

(getting nervous)

Um... there were lots of cars parked on the street.

ARTHUR

Was there anyone else on the street
besides you?

CYNTHIA

No.
 

ARTHUR

Lots of cars, but no people. Any
traffic?

CYNTHIA

I don't remember.

ARTHUR

So you were the only person to see
Joe on the street that night?

CYNTHIA

I didn't see anybody else.

ARTHUR

So you heard a gunshot, a car crash

and a man running with a gun in his
hand.

CYNTHIA

Yes.

ARTHUR

What did you do then? Did you call
the police, 911?

CYNTHIA

I went home.

ARTHUR

You went home. Straight home?

CYNTHIA

Yes.

ARTHUR

And you're sure it was Joe you saw
that night?

CYNTHIA
Yes.

ARTHUR

When you went home.

CYNTHIA

Yes.

Arthur pauses.

ARTHUR
 
When you went home you saw Joe?

Cynthia realizes what she's said.

CYNTHIA

No.

HELEN

Objection. Defense is trying to
confuse the witness.

ARTHUR

I'm not trying to confuse the witness, it's the witness that's trying to confuse the court. I have witnesses who will refute her testimony. Witnesses who were on that corner the night of the shooting, who never saw Ms. Webb, who never heard the gunshot, who never saw Joe run past. Ms Webb saw Joe outside her apartment building that night because he lived in the alley next to it. Isn't that right, Ms Webb?

Arthur turns dramatically to Cynthia. She is scared.

HELEN

Objection!

Everyone's attention is on Cynthia.

ARTHUR

When I referred to him as Joe, you knew who I was talking about, didn't you. This case is the People versus Mr. William McCall. Not Joe. Joe has never been mentioned in this trial. How did you know who I was talking about, Ms. Webb?

Cynthia looks from Arthur to Divinci. Divinci is

frozen.
Rodriguez is sweating.

Then Cynthia turns and looks at Joe.

Joe looks at her, feeling sorry for her. Not hating
her.

ARTHUR

Ms. Webb, how did you know that Joe
 
was the defendant?

Cynthia lowers her eyes to the floor.

CYNTHIA

He lived in the alley next to my
apartment building.

Helen and Richard Stein are stunned yet again.

HELEN

(to herself)
Oh shit.

Divinci and Rodriguez are doing their best to remain

cool,
calm and collected.

ARTHUR

Why did you lie to this court?

CYNTHIA

I don't know.

ARTHUR

Are you afraid of somebody?

CYNTHIA

I don't know.

ARTHUR

Are you protecting somebody?

CYNTHIA

I don't know.

JUDGE HAROLD PINE

Answer the questions, Ms. Webb or
I'll be forced to cite you for
contempt.

Cynthia looks up at the judge. She's not talking.


CUT TO:

CYNTHIA

having her mug shots taken. Holding a number. On the
FLASH --
 

CUT TO:

INT. UNMARKED CAR - STREET - DAY

Driving.

RODRIGUEZ

She didn't talk.

DIVINCI

Don't hold your breath.

RODRIGUEZ

You think she'll talk.

DIVINCI

I know she'll talk.

RODRIGUEZ

We'll make it look gang related.

DIVINCI
Problem is we're gonna need another
gun.

RODRIGUEZ

The problem?! Have you forgotten?
She's in fucking jail. That's the
goddamn problem.

DIVINCI

Since when is being in jail a guaranty of a long life? You just get a fuckin' gun.

EXT. STREET - DAY

Rodriguez gets out of the car. Divinci pulls away,
driving
into traffic. Rodriguez heads into the Station.


CUT TO:

INT. BAIL BOND OFFICE - DAY

Divinci enters. Manny looks up from his desk. His face
is
bruised and bandaged.

MANNY
 
Oh shit. I didn't do anything!

DIVINCI

Everything's fine, Manny. I just
came to apologize.
(looks at secretary)
We need some privacy...

Manny looks at Divinci, then motions for his Secretary
to
take a walk. She gets up, exits.

DIVINCI

Just one more favor. I want you to
bail somebody out of jail.

MANNY

You're kiddin'.

DIVINCI

Bail's twenty-five thousand.

Divinci pulls out a piece of paper.

DIVINCI

I want her out tonight. And don't
tell her who. It's a surprise.

MANNY
And how'm I payin' for this? They
don't take American Express.

Divinci pulls a plastic bag filled with cocaine out of
his
pocket -- tosses it onto Manny's desk.

DIVINCI

I know you know how to exchange that. It's worth a lot more than twenty-five grand. You can keep the change.
(points to cocaine)
I want her back in two hours... Or

I'll nail you for possession.

MANNY

How'd you get to be such a prick?

DIVINCI
DNA.

Divinci exits.
 
MANNY

What a piece of shit.


CUT TO:

INT. COUNTY JAIL CELL - NIGHT

Cynthia sits alone in her cell.


CUT TO:

INT. COUNTY JAIL CELL - NIGHT

Joe lies on his cot. But even though he is in jail for
murder,
he is no longer the bum. This is a new man now. Clean
shaven.
Hair cut. Prison clothes neat. Duncan rolls over on his
cot.

DUNCAN
You don't have to say nothin', but...
you really a doctor?

WILLIAM

...I was... a surgeon.

DUNCAN

No shit, no shit, really. A surgeon. I know I'm nobody to judge, but you musta been a smart guy. What the hell's a smart guy like you doin' in here?

Joe looks up at Duncan, hesitates, then --

WILLIAM

...I had an affair with another woman... a nurse at the hospital I worked at. It was nothing... I can't even remember much about her... Except my wife found out. We had a fight. She left the house, took the kids...

She was hysterical. I should've done something... gone after them, I don't know... they were killed in a car accident about a mile from the house... I've never told anybody that... about why she left.
 
Duncan nods.

DUNCAN

Hey, doc, you can trust me. It won't go no farther.


CUT TO:

EXT. 6TH STREET OUTSIDE STATION - NIGHT

Rodriguez is outside the Station. Looking nervous and
upset.
The unmarked car pulls up. Rodriguez moves for the car.
He

gets in and the car pulls away.

INT. UNMARKED CAR - NIGHT

Divinci drives. Rodriguez sweats. Divinci notices.

DIVINCI

You get the gun?

RODRIGUEZ

I got it.

DIVINCI

Everything okay?

RODRIGUEZ

Are you kidding? We're going to kill a goddamn witness who's in fucking jail because we killed an undercover DEA agent. I'm sorry, but this kinda shit troubles me a little.

DIVINCI

Take off the dress and get back in
the game. We gotta do what we gotta
do.

RODRIGUEZ

Yeah. I know. Let's just get it over with.

Divinci glances at Rodriguez. He's more nervous than
normal.


CUT TO:
 
EXT. COUNTY JAIL - FRONT - NIGHT

Manny walks out of the jail building. Cynthia is with
him.

CYNTHIA

I don't understand. Why can't you
tell me who put up the bond?

MANNY
Look, a guy comes in, says bail her
out, gives me the money, I do it.
That's how I make my living, I bail
fuckin' people outa jail. You wait
with me.

CYNTHIA

Was it a cop?

MANNY

Yeah, right. Cops bail people outa
jail all the time. Doesn't there
seem to be a dichotomy there for
you?

CYNTHIA

I don't like this.

MANNY

You wanna stay in jail, that's up to you. Or you come with me.

CYNTHIA

What'd he look like?

MANNY

You're a stripper right? Lotta guys fall in love with your type. But they don't know how to get close, know what I mean? Somebody wants you to owe them something.
(shrugs)

Take it or leave it.

Manny starts down the steps. Cynthia hesitates, then
follows.

INT. UNMARKED CAR - PARKED DOWN THE STREET - NIGHT

Divinci and Rodriguez watch Cynthia get into the car
with
Manny.
 

RODRIGUEZ

This is the last time, Frank. The
last time we kill somebody.

DIVINCI

Yeah, it's the last time.

RODRIGUEZ

This'll be eleven, Frank. Eleven is
enough.

DIVINCI

I get the picture.

Divinci looks at Rodriguez. He's staring out the
window, but
he looks ill. Something is not right with him.

RODRIGUEZ

It was all okay until you shot Hudd.

DIVINCI
What's goin' on here? You mad at me
or something?

RODRIGUEZ

It wasn't my idea to start killing people, Frank. That's all I'm sayin'. We're in this goddamn mess because you started killing people.

DIVINCI

Drug dealers don't qualify as people. Never did, never will. So what the hell's wrong with you tonight? You suddenly worried about where all the money went?

RODRIGUEZ

I'm just sick of it, that's all.

Divinci stares at Rodriguez for a beat, then starts
car.


CUT TO:

EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

The unmarked car turns off the street onto the side
street
 
and stops. The lights go out.

INT. UNMARKED CAR - NIGHT

RODRIGUEZ

What're you doin'?

DIVINCI

I need some fresh air.

Divinci exits. Rodriguez hesitates, then gets out with
him.

EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

RODRIGUEZ
Frank --

DIVINCI

Talk to me, okay? Just fuckin' talk
to me.

Rodriguez hesitates a moment, then --

RODRIGUEZ

I don't know... I owe some money. I
don't know how I'm gonna pay it...

DIVINCI
You gambling again?

RODRIGUEZ

Yeah, yeah... I just couldn't... Frank... let's forget about this. Let's just get the fuck outa here. We got enough money, let's go. We'll get outa the country or something.

Divinci turns toward Rodriguez. And he's got his pistol
out.

RODRIGUEZ

What the hell're you doin'?!

DIVINCI

Take off your shirt.

RODRIGUEZ
What're you talkin' about?

DIVINCI

Just take off your shirt. If there's
 
nothin' to worry about, then I'll

apologize. But I'm not gonna argue.
Take off your fuckin' shirt now.

RODRIGUEZ

What is this, you piece of shit?!
You don't trust me?! Is that it?!
YOU DON'T FUCKIN' TRUST ME AFTER ALL
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH?!

DIVINCI

...Take off your shirt.

RODRIGUEZ

Fuck you, you don't trust me.

DIVINCI

I'm askin' you one more time.

RODRIGUEZ

You wanna shoot me? Shoot me.

Divinci hesitates. He doesn't want to. This is his
partner.
A beat, then he lowers his gun.

DIVINCI

Okay, I'm sorry. You're right. I'm
fuckin' nervous. Like you. Forget
it. This thing... shit. Let's just

get it over with.

Divinci holsters his gun. Rodriguez hesitates, breathes
a
sigh, then returns to the car. They both get back in.

INT. UNMARKED CAR - NIGHT

Divinci starts up the car.

DIVINCI
I'll just feel a whole lot better
when she's dead. Then we're off the
hook.

RODRIGUEZ

Right.

Divinci starts to shift gears, but suddenly throws his
elbow
into Rodriguez' face. And Divinci is all over him like
a
 
tornado. Slamming a fist into his face repeatedly. He

grabs

his shirt and rips it open REVEALING the TAPE RECORDER strapped to his body, recording their every word.

DIVINCI
YOU FUCKIN' RAT!

Divinci puts his revolver to Rodriguez' head.
Rodriguez,
bleeding from the mouth and nose, looks at Frank.

RODRIGUEZ

Yeah... yeah... I am, I'm a fuckin' rat... I traded you, Frank, I fuckin' traded you... Simms knows everything.

Divinci pulls back the hammer, ready to blow Rodriguez'
head
off.

RODRIGUEZ

Just fuckin' shoot me, get it the
fuck over with! I DESERVE IT! I
FUCKING DESERVE TO DIE!

Divinci is ready to pull the trigger.

DIVINCI
You're fuckin' right.

Divinci rips the wires off the recorder. Rodriguez
closes
his eyes, waiting for the end. A tense moment, then --

DIVINCI

...Get out.

Rodriguez opens his eyes, looking at Divinci, who is
still
holding the gun to his head. Another moment, then --

RODRIGUEZ

Frank --

DIVINCI

(calm)
Get outa the car NOW!

A beat, then Rodriguez gets out. Divinci looks up at
his
partner.
 

DIVINCI

This is why you can never -- ever -- lose your sense of fuckin' humor.

EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

The car tears away, leaving Rodriguez alone in the
alley.


CUT TO:

THE KEY - INSERTED INTO THE DOOR LOCK - NIGHT

Rodriguez pushes open the door to his apartment,
enters.
Shuts the door. Stands alone in the room for a moment,
then
suddenly erupts in rage. Ripping off his coat, ripping
off
his shirt, ripping off the tape recorder taped to his
chest.

He throws the recorder on the ground. Stomps on it
until
it's shattered into pieces. He stares at the broken
recorder.

MAN'S VOICE (VIC)

I guess we caught you at a bad time.

Rodriguez spins around. Vic steps into the moonlight
streaming
in through the window. Behind him is Cutless Supreme.

VIC

But we all have problems.

Rodriguez suddenly YELLS and CHARGES THEM. He tackles
Vic.
But in the darkness we can't see anything. Until the

explosion
of a GUN and the FLASH of flames lights up the room. A
moment
of silence then --

VIC
Oh shit. You shot him, you fuckin'
shot him!
 
Two men stumble to the door. Leaving one on the floor.

The
door is flung open and Vic runs out. Followed by
Cutless
Supreme.


CUT TO:

CRIME SCENE TAPE - INT. RODRIGUEZ APARTMENT - EARLY
MORNING

The crime scene is swarming with cops, DEA and FBI. The
task
of evidence collection in progress. Rodriguez' body on

the

floor. Agent Simms is standing over the body with Agent Sarkasian.

AGENT SARKASIAN

Divinci musta figured it. I didn't
think he'd kill his own partner
though.

SIMMS

He's an animal.

DEA AGENT Hooper comes up behind Simms.

AGENT HOOPER

Recorders busted up. But we might be able to salvage some of the tape.

SIMMS

I want him. You understand me, I
don't care what it takes. I want
that sonuvabitch!

Simms heads for the door. Sarkasian and Hooper follow.


CUT TO:

EXT. BAIL BOND OFFICE - MORNING

A car pulls up in front.

INT. BAIL BOND OFFICE - MORNING

It is deadly quiet. We PAN SLOWLY around the office
until we
 
find Manny in his chair, sprawled back. Continuing to

PAN
until we see Cynthia sprawled on the couch. But no
signs of
blood. Just the bodies. The door opens. TWO MEN enters.
All
we SEE are GUNS in hands.

Cynthia and Manny wake up with a start. Manny is
scared.

MANNY

Shit! Who the fuck're you?!

A BADGE comes out. And now we see Agents Hooper and

Sarkasian.

AGENT SARKASIAN

Ms. Webb. We'd like you to come with us.

Cynthia looks at Manny. She's pissed.

CYNTHIA

This was the big secret? Shit. You're an asshole.

Cynthia puts her coat on and heads for the door. Manny
doesn't
know what the hell is going on.


CUT TO:

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - FEDERAL BLDG. - DAY

Cynthia is in with Agents Simms, Hooper and Sarkasian.

SIMMS

Who set it up?

CYNTHIA

I don't know.

AGENT HOOPER

It was Divinci wasn't it?

CYNTHIA
I don't know.

SIMMS

Which one pulled the trigger? Divinci
 
or Rodriguez?

CYNTHIA

I don't know.

Agent Simms looks right into Cynthia's eyes.

SIMMS

Detective Rodriguez is dead. He was
shot in the head last night.

This gets Cynthia's attention.

SIMMS

Rodriguez was wearing a recorder. Divinci found it. You can do addition, can't you.

CYNTHIA

You're full of shit.

AGENT SARKASIAN

Just tell us what you know.

Cynthia looks at both of them.

CYNTHIA

Where's Divinci?

SIMMS

We don't know. But we're gonna find
him.

CYNTHIA

You're gonna find him?
(smiles sarcastically)
Right... I don't know a fuckin' thing.

Simms stares at her for a moment, then turns to Hooper
and
nods. Hooper takes Cynthia's arm and leads her out of
the

office. When the door closes --

SIMMS

Get a copy of the tape to Bailor.
But make sure it doesn't come from
us.


CUT TO:
 
INT. COUNTY JAIL CELL - DAY

Cynthia is alone in her cell. We HEAR footsteps. She
looks
up as the GUARD approaches.

GUARD

Your attorney's here.

CYNTHIA
What attorney?

INT. ROOM - COUNTY JAIL - DAY

Cynthia enters the office. The Guard shuts the door.

Cynthia
finds herself facing Arthur Baylor. A tape recorder on
the
table in front of him.

ARTHUR

Hi, Cynthia. Please sit down.

CYNTHIA

I got nothin' to say.

ARTHUR

So I'm told.

Arthur pushes the tape recorder and we HEAR --

DIVINCI'S VOICE

...Take off your shirt...

RODRIGUEZ'S VOICE
Fuck you, you don't trust me.

DIVINCI'S VOICE

I'm askin' you one more time.

RODRIGUEZ'S VOICE
You wanna shoot me? Shoot me.

DIVINCI'S VOICE

Okay, I'm sorry. You're right. I'm
fuckin' nervous. Like you. Forget
it. This thing... shit. Let's just
get it over with. I'll just feel a
whole lot better when she's dead.
Then we're off the hook.
 
Arthur watches Cynthia's reaction to "when she's dead."

But
Cynthia has seen enough not to be too shocked by
anything.
And her reaction is subtle. She knows better than to
reveal
what she's really feeling and thinking.

RODRIGUEZ'S VOICE

Right.

DIVINCI'S VOICE
YOU FUCKIN' RAT!

RODRIGUEZ'S VOICE

Yeah... yeah... I am, I'm a fuckin' rat... I traded you, Frank, I fuckin' traded you... Simms knows everything. Just fuckin' shoot me, get it the fuck over with! I DESERVE IT! I
FUCKING DESERVE TO DIE!

DIVINCI'S VOICE
You're fuckin' right.

The recording ends. Arthur shuts off the machine.

ARTHUR

I think you know my client is
innocent. That's all I care about,

my client. But I understand why you're scared. You're already facing perjury charges. My guess is, your involvement is deeper than that. But I don't really care, I'm not after you... I get nothing if you go to jail. But I think if I help you, I can help my client.

CYNTHIA

...how?

ARTHUR

William -- Joe -- didn't do it, did
he?

Cynthia hesitates, then shakes her head.

ARTHUR

Why don't you sit down.

A beat, then Cynthia pulls up a chair.
 


CUT TO:

AGENT SIMMS - INT. OFFICE - DAY

angry.

SIMMS

No goddamn way! I'm not going to grant that whore immunity. She lied on the stand, she's protecting somebody. And she's involved. I want them all.

Arthur, who was sitting across from him, stands.

ARTHUR

Before I leave, let me remind you that you have shit for a case. If you really care about seeing justice for your dead agent, don't blow this deal. Immunity for her testimony is a small price for a bad cop. It's the only way she's going to talk.

Simms glares at Arthur.

ARTHUR

And William McCall walks, right now, all charges dropped.

Simms hesitates, then --

SIMMS
If what she says is any good, I'll
deal. If it isn't, then nobody goes
anywhere.


CUT TO:

INT. HALLWAY - CRIMINAL COURTS BUILDING - DAY

Cynthia is lead down the hall by GUARDS. They enter an
office.

INT. OFFICE - CRIMINAL COURTS BUILDING - DAY

Agents Simms, Hooker, Sarkasian and TWO TECHNICIANS are waiting inside with Arthur. Cynthia is lead into the

room.
 
The guards withdraw, closing the door.

Cynthia looks at the men, then at the TAPE RECORDING
EQUIPMENT
on the table and the empty chair. A MICROPHONE is
waiting.

Cynthia looks at Arthur, then sits down in the chair.


CUT TO:

EXT. CRIMINAL COURTS BUILDING - DAY

REPORTERS swarm around Arthur and Joe as they exit the courthouse.

REPORTERS

How does it feel to be a free man
again?

Arthur and Joe head down the steps to a waiting
LIMOUSINE.

REPORTERS

Do you remember everything that happened to you? What are your plans?

WILLIAM
I just want to go back to work.

REPORTERS

As a surgeon?

WILLIAM
Yes.

REPORTERS

What about the signed confession,

did the police coerce you into signing it?

ARTHUR

I'm sorry, no more questions.

They get into the back of the waiting limo and it pulls
away.

INT. LIMOUSINE - DAY

Nathan is in the back, staring at Joe. Arthur sits next
to
 
Joe. Nathan smiles. Joe smiles.

NATHAN

Good to have you back, Will.

WILLIAM

...I'd like to make one stop.

NATHAN

I know.


CUT TO:

EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

The limousine is parked curbside. Nathan and Arthur
wait.
Watching Joe walk across the lawn. He stops, looking
down.

The grave stones are for his wife and two children. He
sits
down beside them. It's very near where Agent Hudd was
buried.


CUT TO:

EXT. THE MCCALL MANSION - DUSK

Giant party in progress. Expensive cars parked along
the
drive.

INT. MCCALL MANSION - DUSK

Filled with well-wishers in TUXES and GOWNS. Arthur
Bailor
and Elliot in attendance. Elliot isn't used to this
much
glory, but he's taking credit where where he can --

with one
of the PRETTY YOUNG WOMEN.

ELLIOT

--	you know, it just didn't make

sense, a man wanting to be punished for a crime? How many times does that happen? Once in a lifetime, I can tell you.
 
CAMERA MOVES to Arthur, who is also receiving his share

of
the credit.

ARTHUR

--	to tell the truth, I had no other witnesses to refute her testimony. But she didn't know that. All we knew was that she was reluctant to testify. You look for signs.

And CAMERA CONTINUES TO Joe and Nathan.

A MAN

My God, we thought you were dead,

you know. It's just incredible that
you're here.

A WOMAN

Life moves in such strange ways. Oh, I just think what might've happened to you had you not been arrested for killing that poor policeman. You still might be on the street.

Joe just takes it all in, smiling and nodding.

ANOTHER WOMAN

Joe, you look wonderful. After what
you've been through... I just can't

imagine.

ANOTHER MAN (SINCLAIR)

When you're ready to come back to work, let me know. I've already spoken to the board, they're ready to re-certify you anytime. I can put you

in the emergency sector until you get warmed up. We all want you back. We can't afford to waste someone of your talent.

A beat, then Joe smiles.

WILLIAM

...I'm ready.

A BLACK TUXEDO WIPES past CAMERA as we --


CUT TO:
 
BLACK SCREEN. We HEAR the POUNDING of the MUSIC -- a

FAMILIAR
RHYTHM. And in GRAFFITI across the screen:

FOUR MONTHS LATER

EXT. STRIP JOINT - NIGHT

The neon blares as usual.

INT. STRIP JOINT - NIGHT

And there's Cynthia. Back bumping and grinding to the
music.
He life hasn't changed at all. And she knows it. But

there's
nothing else she can do.


CUT TO:

INT. CYNTHIA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT (EARLY MORNING)

Door opens. Cynthia enters. Shuts the door. Tries the
light.
It doesn't go on. Suddenly a man is next to her --

MAN'S VOICE (DIVINCI)

I guess you had no choice.

Cynthia tries to move, but a hand grabs her arm. And
now we
see Divinci. He looks like hell. A man on the run.
Desperate
and dangerous. He hasn't shaved. His clothes are
filthy. He
looks like... Joe. Cynthia looks up at him.

DIVINCI

You had to do the right thing.

CYNTHIA

What d'you want?

DIVINCI

What do I want?

Divinci suddenly shoves her hard across the room.

DIVINCI

Why're you asking me that? You gonna grant me three wishes? I don't know
 
where to start. Let's see... money

would be nice... love would be
better... but a little loyalty...
you can never get enough of that.
(moves up to her)
...But we'll start with... money.

Divinci pushes her into the bedroom.

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT (EARLY MORNING)

Cynthia goes to her closet, pulls out a box, opens it.
It's
got her savings.

CYNTHIA
This is all I've got.

Divinci grabs the money and stuffs it into his jacket
pocket.

CYNTHIA

They'll catch you.

DIVINCI

I don't think so.

CYNTHIA

You wanna bet?

DIVINCI

They don't have a clue, baby. And
you wanna know why? Because I am
following my heart.

Divinci puts aside his gun. And pushes Cynthia down on
the
bed. He leans in close to her. Face to face.

DIVINCI

And they don't know where that is.

CYNTHIA

So tell me about your plans. I think
I'd like to hear 'em now.

Divinci looks at Cynthia for a moment, almost with
remorse.

DIVINCI

Loyalty is what it all comes down to. Nothing holds together when it's
 

gone. And once it's gone, you don't ever get it back... You shouldn't've told 'em.

CYNTHIA

I shouldn't've done a lotta things
in my life. But that's not one of
'em.

DIVINCI

Let me tell you something... the only difference between a liar and a witness is that just one of 'em knows what he's doing.

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT (EARLY MORNING)

It is dark and quiet. No clue as to what's going on
inside.
And we hold on this for a long moment. Just wondering
what's
she being made to do. And then there's a MUFFLED BOOM.
Divinci
exits the bedroom quickly. He is upset. We HEAR the
DOOR
close.

AND WHITE FEATHERS

fall like snow flakes on Cynthia's body draped across
the
bed. The pillow on the floor beside her with the
stuffing
blown out. She has a hole in her chest, right above her
heart.


CUT TO:

INT. BAIL BOND OFFICE - EARLY MORNING

Manny unlocks the door, enters his office.

DIVINCI'S VOICE

Shut the door and lock it.

MANNY

Jesus Christ!

Manny looks toward the voice. Divinci is sitting on the
floor
out of sight. Holding his revolver.
 

MANNY

You scared the shit outa me.

DIVINCI

Lock the door.

Manny locks the door.

DIVINCI
One more favor, Manny.

MANNY

Since when did I become such a good
guy?

DIVINCI

I'm takin' some time off. I want a car, here tonight, and a driver. You can do that for your old friend, right?

MANNY
(disgusted)

Yeah, I can do that. But you are a hot fuckin' potato. And drivers that don't talk, don't come cheap.

DIVINCI
I got the money. Just put it together.


CUT TO:

EXT. HOSPITAL - EARLY MORNING

An AMBULANCE races up to the EMERGENCY entrance.

INT. HOSPITAL - EARLY MORNING

TWO PARAMEDICS push the gurney down the hall. Cynthia
is

conscious on the gurney. Looking up at the ceiling. She
is
fading. We HEAR --

VOICES

--	come on, hang in there, hold on. CYNTHIA'S (MOVING) P.O.V OF THE CEILING and FACES.
 
The gurney pushes past and CAMERA PICKS UP TWO SURGEONS

moving
out of an Operating Room. Pulling off masks and rubber
gloves
bloody from surgery. One of them is Joe. The other
surgeon
pats him on the back.

OTHER SURGEON

Just like riding a bike.

Joe finally breathes a sigh of relief and manages a
smile.


CUT TO:

BLACK LINCOLN - EXT. BAIL BOND OFFICE - NIGHT

pulls up in front of the office. Tinted windows.

INT. BAIL BOND OFFICE - NIGHT

Manny is looking out the window.

MANNY

Leather upholstery, moon roof, CD.
What more could you ask for?

Divinci looks out. Gun in hand. He's cleaned himself
up.
He's now wearing a Hawaiian shirt, slacks. A traveler.

DIVINCI

Better not be a set up.

MANNY

Want me to hold your hand?

DIVINCI

Just walk me to the door.

EXT. BAIL BOND OFFICE - NIGHT

The Lincoln idles at the curb. Divinci and Manny exit
the
office. Divinci glances up and down the street as they
move
toward the car. Manny opens the back door. Nobody
inside.

DIVINCI
 
I think I'll let you live.

MANNY

You are a real prince. Now how about my money?

Divinci hands Manny a wad of cash from his pocket, then
gets
into the back of the car.

DIVINCI

You never saw me.

MANNY

Don't I wish that were true.

He closes the door. The Lincoln pulls away. Manny
watches it
move off down the street.

MANNY

Have a nice trip.

INT. LINCOLN - NIGHT

Driving. Divinci in the back. Can only see the DRIVER'S
EYES
in the REAR VIEW MIRROR.

DIVINCI

Head south. Get on the interstate.
Don't break the speed limit.

Divinci settles into the leather seat. Looks at the
rear
view mirror.

DIVINCI

You know, the one thing about life...
you can never lose your sense of
humor. Without it, you got nothin'.

Suddenly the driver turns around, holding a 9mm and
fires.
BLAM. BLAM. BLAM. Divinci's head snaps back as the BACK
WINDOW
BLOWS OUT of the Lincoln.

And now we recognize the driver. It's Clyle D. Dunner.

CLYDE

Fuckin' A.
 

THE LINCOLN

moves right into CAMERA. BRIGHT HEADLIGHTS filling the
screen.
The car stops. We HEAR the DOOR OPEN and RUNNING FEET.
And
PAN INTO THE BRIGHT HEADLIGHTS GLARING into CAMERA.


CUT TO:

SURGICAL LIGHTS - INT. OPERATING ROOM - NIGHT

SHINING BRIGHTLY into CAMERA.

MAN'S VOICE

-- run the cardioplegia.

Faces appear. Looking down. We recognize Joe and one of
the
friends from the party -- Sinclair.

WILLIAM

She's fibrilating. Go on bypass.

Faces move away as we HEAR MEDICAL MACHINES in
operation. A
NURSE reappears. CAMERA MOVES back now, revealing the
room.

And the operation in progress.

SURGEON SINCLAIR

Forceps.
(A nurse hands him
forceps)
Just like old times.

WILLIAM

I wouldn't have done this without
you... I owe you.

SURGEON SINCLAIR

Lucky to have a donor. Never would've survived the night. Have a suture ready.

NURSE
(picks up suture)
I heard it was a cop's heart.

Joe looks at the nurse.
 

NURSE

He was shot in the head a couple
hours ago.

CAMERA PUSHES IN ON JOE

NURSE

They think it was gang related.

The BRIGHT LIGHTS OVERHEAD bleed the scene to WHITE and
we --


DISSOLVE TO:

WAVES - DAY

crashing on white sand. PANNING with the clear blue
water
racing up the sand to a woman in a bathing suit,
sitting
alone. We PAN UP HER LEGS, past her stomach, to her
CHEST
where we see a SCAR ABOVE HER HEART.

We CONTINUE UP TO HER FACE NOW. It's Cynthia. Staring
out at
the ocean. Palm trees behind her. She's beautiful. She
leans

back, hands behind her and... She smiles. Her life has changed. And we HEAR HAWAIIAN SLACK KEY GUITAR MUSIC as

we
