"GANGS OF NEW YORK"
INT. ROOM OLD BREWERY DAY
Half in shadow, a man named VALLON, dressed in black, fastens a clean white clerical collar around his thick neck. He raises a jagged razor to his face, RAKES it across his right cheek, drawing BLOOD. He does not flinch.
The sharp SCRAPING of the jagged blade against skin is the first SOUND we hear. VALLON cuts himself similarly on the left cheek, then hands the razor ceremoniously to a BOY standing beside him. The boy, no more than twelve years old, looks at VALLON worshipfully, keen eyes shining with fear and excitement. He starts to wipe the razor blade on the bottom of his jacket.
VALLON
No. Never. The blood stays on the blade, son.
He hands the boy a dark red velvet pouch. Very carefully, the boy, known as AMSTERDAM, wraps the razor up, hands it back to his father. From the shadows, VALLON now raises a long pole with a beautiful golden crucifix mounted on the end, then holds his free hand out to his son.
Amsterdam squeezes tight. VALLON nods toward the door. Amsterdam pulls it open. Outside is a dim hallway. We hear SOUNDS that might be animal or human. MUSIC begins: a steady, driving cadence somewhere between a march and a hymn.
CUT TO
INT. HALLWAY
VALLON strides in long measured steps. Amsterdam has trouble keeping up with him. They are walking down a long corridor that's like a tunnel. Patches of LIGHT stain the darkness. Sometimes Amsterdam glimpses a FACE peering out from the gloom. Once or twice he almost stumbles over a BODY stretched across his path.
CUT TO
INT. ROOM
Another room, even smaller. The only decoration is a bizarre rendering of a Madonna and child painted on the wall.
A beefy man picks up a home-made PIKE, its iron tip sharpened to a lethal point. He is smiling. The grin is huge, but cockeyed. It
2
occupies only half of his face. The grotesque, unending grin is the result of facial paralysis, and has given him a nickname: HAPPY JACK MULRANEY. Jack lifts the pike carefully, then takes a candle from the wall and bends down over a wooden cage full of rabbits. He slowly moves the candle back and forth across the cage top. Wax falls on the cage, splattering an unlucky rabbit.
Jack thrusts the pike between the wooden bars, impaling the rabbit's body. He pulls the pike from the cage and leaves.
CUT TO
INT. HALLWAY
Jack falls into step beside VALLON and Amsterdam. He holds the pike with the dead rabbit high, next to VALLON's cross.
HAPPY JACK
Did you bring the boy for a charm, Priest?
VALLON
No, Jack. For a baptism.
Now a WOMAN joins them. She's dressed in man's clothes, her pants held up by suspenders. She wears a set of IRON CLAWS. MUSIC builds, growing more insistent and more ominous. Now a figure looms before them. Over his street clothes, this WARRIOR wears a rig of home-made armor made from fracgments of steel, lengths of chain and bits of leather. He carries a battle-axe as lightly as if it were a twig.
RABBIT WARRIOR
We'll send a few across the river today, Priest.
He joins the procession. Another woman, as tough as the first and half again as large, and several more men, all armed with implements of destruction, fall in beside him. Their faces are marked with blood, like Vallan's, or covered with ritual markings made with paint and ink. The group grows ever larger and more forbidding. occasionally PEOPLE dart around them in the tunnel and scamper out of their way like animals frightened in a burrow.
CUT TO
INT. ROOM
Vast and dank, like a cavern. We start CLOSE on...  the body of a dead rat being filled with some pieces of lead. Then a little WIDER to reveal: an eager boy, SHANG DRAPER, about the same age as Amsterdam. He drops the last few pieces of lead into the mouth of the rat, then sews it closed. He hefts the animal by the tail, swinging it as he stands up.
3
He is near a primitive forge where a half-drunk SLACKSMITH hammers crude weapons into shape and distributes them to OTHER MEN and WOMEN. The floor is covered with bits of lead and steel, which Shang has been using to sew into his rat.
Shang FOLLOWS the crowd of men and women with their weapons. And now we see this room full. It is huge: the main room of the Old Brewery, crowded with families huddled together for warmth and comfort, or out of fear; men and women, together or separately, drunk or passed out. They are like zoo animals in a pit. There are sticks of furniture jammed in corners, or, more often, arranged at angles in the middle of the room to form tiny enclaves where the ancient brewery machinery forms irregular boundaries.
Above Shang's head, VALLON and his gang walk across a plank bridge that spans the room a hundred feet beneath them. Armed men and women from the Brewery are climbing a rope ladder to join them. Shang SCURRIES up after them.
The men and women from the Brewery fall in behind VALLON and the others in the lead. Shang SPOTS someone near his own age toward the front: Amsterdam. He presses through the crowd like a hunting dog.
SHANG
What's the fight?
AMSTERDAM
The Dead Rabbits against the Native Americans, same as ever. But it'll
all
be settled today.
SHANG
Are you Native or Rabbit?
AMSTERDAM
(points to rabbit on pike)
What do you think?
SHANG
Looks alright. I'll stand by you, then.
CUT TO
INT. HALLWAY
The group now turns down the last corridor, as dim and long as a tunnel. In the distance, there's a faint glimmer of light and the figure of a MAN (MONK EASTMAN). VALLON stops near the door.
4
VALLON
I don't know you.
MAN
(lightly)
I suppose there's to be a fight.
VALLON catches the heavy Celtic inflection in the man's voice.
VALLON
Derry?
MAN
Donnegal. Name's Monk Eastman.
VALLON
And you want to fight, Mr. Eastman?
MONK
lf there's money in it.
VALLON
Fight for the Natives. They have a proper war chest.
MONK
Well, I might at that. But I thought I'd ask you first, seeing as how
I'm
not quite a Native American myself.
VALLON
Let's see your skills, and we'll talk of payment later.
MONK
Fine. But if you like what you see, pay me double.
Monk turns to the door with the grace of a dancer and delivers a SHATTERING kick, sending it flying off its hinges. Clear white LIGHT streams in, and we see Monk Eastman plain for the first time: a huge man,
in stature and girth, wearing a small DERBY that intentionally makes
his
head look even bigger.
VALLON
(as the door splinters settle)
Stand with us then.
CUT TO
EXT. STREET DAY (WINTER)
WINTER WIND blows across a scene as strange and bleak as an alien planet.
5
VALLON, carrying his cross high, steps through the doorway. The OTHERS slowly follow VALLON out of the building, which is three stories high and maybe a block long. A dilapidated sign identifies it as the 5 Paints Brewery.
It is the tallest structure in the midst of low, squalid SHACKS, winding ALLEYS as narrow as a snakels back, and DIRT STREETS filled with ruts, mud and filthy snow. A few PIGS wander forlornly about, rooting for garbage. WASH hangs stiff, in the middle of the square, from a peculiar monument erected to some forgotten war hero.
The Brewery occupies one side of a SQUARE surrounded by some storefronts and a couple of collapsed wooden sidewalks. If this place resembles anything at all, it's a horrible hybrid of London's Limehouse and a pioneer town in the American West whose best days have long passedâ€”or never came at all.
VALLON stands still, staring across the square past the monument. His battalion of irregulars waits for his signal. Now...  very, very slowly... from around both sides of the monument comes ANOTHER GANG, in size the same as VALLON's, men and women both, armed like Visigoths with HOMEMADE WEAPONS: knives, pitchforks, building blocks and bricks, boards with sharp nails protruding from the ends. Every member of this second group is dressed in a long DUSTER which reaches to the ankles. Several MEN in front of the group sport dusters made of leather.
VALLON
Bill Poole! on whose challenge are we assembled?
A MAN in a leather duster (BILL THE BUTCHER) steps forward. He is young, lean and fierce. And then there are his eyes. They do not match. One is real. The other is a huge, bulging PEARL upon which has been engraved, instead of a pupil, a full-color portrait of the AMERICAN EAGLE.
On the side of the square, arranged to get a good view of the impending combat, is a group of STREET KIDS, girls and boys, none older than eight. They talk and laugh excitedly among themselves, picking their own favorites among the gangs as if the warriors were players on a team.
BILL THE BUTCHER
On the challenge of the Native Americans, to settle for good and all
who holds sway.
VALLON
Bene.
6
BILL THE BUTCHER
By the ancient laws of combat, we offer our bodies to the ghosts of those warriors who have gone before us. Valor is avid for glory, and glory is in our wounds.
VALLON
But this time can you bear to look on the glory when it comes, Bill?
Can you see it clear with your single eye?
BILL THE BUTCHER
Whoever fights untouched in battle has skill, but the warrior who
returns wounded has been touched by God.
VALLON
It wasn't God who touched your eye.
BILL THE BUTCHER
It was God gave me guidance. Will you be able to look on the death blow like a gladiator, and not look away? No honorable man turns an eye from his death.
VALLON
I don't expect a death blow from your hand, Butcher. Let's have at it.
BILL THE BUTCHER
There is another matter.
VALLON
Say it out and quick, before spring gets here.
BILL THE BUTCHER
No Native American Warrior will dishonor himself with the blood of the
halt and maimed.
VALLON
So?
BILL THE BUTCHER
So we would like to know whether Squire Jack Mulraney of the Dead
Rabbits can smile out of both sides of his face.
A pause of a single second. Then HAPPY JACK takes the dead rabbit off the tip of his pike and hurls it across the square. It lands right at BILL THE BUTCHER's feet.
In a flash, BILL THE BUTCHER opens his coat. Inside, on a special belt he carries a CLEAVER, a CARVING KNIFE and other instruments of the butcherls trade, all stained with blood and gristle. Now the MAN standing next to him removes the broad BELT from around his coat. The brass buckle is sharpened to a point, the leather studded with glass. The gallery of Street Kids tenses for action: they are thrilled.
7
VALLON reaches up to the CROSS, pulls off the top piece, to disclose, underneath, a gleaming sword point. He folds the arms of the cross down, like the blades of a jackknife.
VALLON
Prepare to receive the Lord.
And the air is full of screams and battle cries as the two gangs hurl across Paradise Square into BATTLE. VALLON draws first blood. He impales a Native American on the sword end of his cross and turns to fight again.
Amsterdam and Shang exchange a glance of frightened, worried wonder.
Then a Native American rushes at them, shouting for blood. The boys act together. Amsterdam dives down in front of the man, sending him sprawling. Shang BLUDGEONS the fallen warrior, using his lead-filled rat like a blackjack as Amsterdam kicks him savagely; the Native collapses unconscicus at their feet. Before the boys can thank one another, however, they are separaten by the SURGING GANGS all around them. BILL THE BUTCHER leaves his meat CLEAVER imbedded in the middle of a man's skull, then WADES through the combat as if shielded by a charm.
The gallery of Street Kids is thrilled by this display and reacts with CHEERS.
VALLON BATTLES three Natives who come at him at once.
Monk Eastman grabs a Native in his arms like a groom hugging a bride. He raises his knee and brings the man crashing down across it, BREAKING his spine like a Thanksgiving wishbone. The gallery of Street Kids is awed by this display of power from a new star in the making.
The Rabbit Warrior in the home-made armor grins at an intrepid Native and lowers his battle-axe. The Native rushes as the Rabbit Warrior swings and SEPARATES the man from his legs.
A NATIVE WOMAN lowers her head and charges her Dead Rabbit adversary, delivering a shattering BUTT to his stomach.
A NATIVE BOY holds a rusty old pistol, which he uses at pointblank range against several Rabbits.
A RABBIT WOMAN flies into a Native, using her IRON FINGER EXTENSIONS to GOUGE his face.
The NATIVE with the deadly belt uses it to TEAR a piece out of a Rabbit's face.
Amsterdam, beginning now to be overwhelmed by the hellish fight, looks
8
around in growing PANIC for his father.
SHANG uses his lead-rat blackjack to clear an escape back toward the Brewery. The Street Kids can tell he's trying to escape, and start BOOING him... as Shang's GRABBED from behind and pulled off his feet by a PEG-LEGGED NATIVE. He THROWS the boy to the ground and pins him by holding the sword-sharp point of his wooden leg against Shang's throat.
SHANG
(desperate)
I run with you! I'm one of you! Born a Native American from the blood
of five generations!
PEG-LEG
Yeah? Then you oughta be a red Indian.
He pushes down. Shang starts to bleed. But now PEG LEG is distracted by the sudden SOUND of bells and whistles. He watches the BOY trembling on the ground, then moves off him, making for the sound of the bell, leaving the BOY quaking.
The SOUND grows louder as TWO HORSE-DRAWN CARTS full of battle ready POLICE tear around the curve of a narrow thoroughfare and stop in Paradise Square. The BELLS on the carts toll loudly and work magic. The fighting stops.
The POLICE, all carrying clubs and wearing leather helmets, LEAP OFF the wagons.
There are several moments of ABSOLUTE SILENCE, broken only by the SOUND of the wind and the GROANS of the wounded.
Then, as one, the Dead Rabbits and the Native Americans RUSH the police together, hurtling stones and brandishing weapons. Even the Street Kids get into the act, kicking and biting and generally having a fine time. The gangs SWARM all over the police, driving them back. Some lucky cops climb back on the wagons and try to get away. The unlucky police remain behind, dead on the ground.
The GANGS cheer, jeer and continue to throw things at the retreating POLICE. When the second wagon disappears from view, the GANGS confront each other once again. Another brief moment of QUIET. The Street Kids settle back into their spectator role. Then the GANGS go at each other with fresh intensity. Amsterdam finally SEES his father and starts to PUSH his way toward him.
VALLON and BILL THE BUTCHER stand facing each other in the midst of battle like two titans: then they rush at each other, joining with a terrible fury.
Shang, still blindly SWINGING his blackjack, makes his way closer to the relative safety of the Brewery, his face stained with tears of
9
fear. He hits someone. The MAN turns, swats him down. Shang sprawls on the street, which is a SWAMP of mud and blood and dirty snow, and finds himself face to face with a departed PEG LEG. Someone has removed his artificial limb and driven it through his heart.
Across the square, Amsterdam has reached his father in time to see a NATIVE AMERICAN sneaking up behind him. Amsterdam grabs a long TRUNCHEON from a fallen warrior and uses it to hit the man a strong blow behind the knees.
The MAN falls, howling. AMSTERDAM HITS him again. And again. He is hysterical.
VALLON and BILL THE BUTCHER keep fighting. Amsterdam sees, with a single look, that his father is in the fight of his life. He looks for a weapon to help... sees a HATCHET lying by the body of the Rabbit he has just beaten senseless. He grabs it and runs forward, looking for an opening between the Butcher and his father... 
As the two combatants move, Amsterdam MOVES. Bobbing, weaving, feinting, falling back looking for his chance... as Bill deals VALLON a blow that ROCKS him back and throws him off balance... 
... just as Amsterdam has made his move. He RUSHES forward, sees his father FALLING, tries to turn but... too late. The boy's hatchet SLASHES his father in the leg. VALLON falls to one knee, gestures frantically to the stunned Amsterdam to get away... and Bill is upon VALLON, SINKING his knife into his chest. VALLON screams and falls on his back, Bill kneeling over him. He looks into his enemy's eyes and VALLON's EYES LOCK ON HIS. For all his suffering, VALLON's eyes HOLD Bill ...  he forces himself to look at Bill... it's a terrible struggle...  but VALLON will not look away. Amsterdam, hysterical, RUSHES at the Butcher. The Butcher grabs Amsterdam by the arm, making him drop his hatchet.
BILL THE BUTCHER
You need a weapon? Use a knife.
He puts the struggling boy's hand on the hilt of the knife that the
Butcher sunk into his father's chest.
BILL THE BUTCHER
It makes a deeper cut.
And, HIS HAND GUIDING THE BOY'S, he RAMS his knife deep into VALLON's
heart.
BILL THE BUTCHER
Say a benediction, Priest.
VALLON bellows in agony. Amsterdam screams at the very same moment, his cry mingling with his father is tearing through the air.
10
BILL THE BUTCHER
(to Amsterdam)
Hold this close to mind, boy, should you ever think of going up
against the Native Americans.
Bill the Butcher rises and all around him, as if on some mysterious signal, the fighting subsides. A DEAD RABBIT sees the fallen Vallon, takes a battered brass HORN from his belt and sounds THREE NOTES, quick and sharp. As the notes fade away, the fighting stops completely.
BILL THE BUTCHER
(announcing)
Ears and noses will be trophies of the day.
The Rabbits SCAMPER to collect their dead and wounded before the Natives can get to them to slice off the battle souvenirs. But there are many corpses maimed. The Street Kids DISPERSE. The main battle is over, and the Natives have clearly carried the day.
The Rabbits file past Vallon, rorming a protective CIRCLE around him. Amsterdam kneels at his side. Vallon tries to speak. Blood bubbles in his throat.
VALLON
Can't..can't cross the river...  with steel through my heart.
Amsterdam looks around. None of the Rabbits makes a move. This is clearly something he is meant to do himself.
Amsterdam grabs the tortoise handle of the knife, PULLS on it. Vallon tries not to cry out. The knife does not move. Amsterdam tries again. He can't budge the knife. Vallon MOANS. Nearly wild, Amsterdam PULLS with all his strength. Vallon SCREAMS in agony. Amsterdam is pulling so hard he raises his father's back four inches off the ground. Still the knife will not move. Vallon passes out from the pain.
Now, finally, someone steps forward: Monk Eastman. He leans over but Amsterdam, berserk with grief, pushes him away, turns back to his father, and, with a last desperate pull, DRAWS the knife from his father's heart. He throws it on the ground. Monk picks it up, wipes the blade on his arm, closes the knife and hands it to Amsterdam.
MONK
That's yours, rightfully.
Now Monk leans over the lifeless body and reaches inside Vallon's coat, REMOVING some money.
MONK
And this is mine. Only what's owed. Use the rest for funeral.
11
AMSTERDAM
No!
He tries to shove Monk away from his father, when the Native Warrior
intervenes.
HAPPY JACK
It's fair.
Amsterdam, wild with shock and grief, turns back to his father as Monk takes what's owed him. Amsterdam bends over to KISS Vallon on both cheeks, then on his left eye.
The boy is just about to kiss his fatheros closed right eye when the lid springs OPEN - Amsterdam jumps back despite himself. Vallon stares at him: a last moment of recognition.
VALLON
Hon ... 
AMSTERDAM
No, Pa!
VALLON
...  honor me...  think of me ...  don't never look away.
Vallon convulses and DIES. Amsterdam shakes him to revive him.
RABBIT WOMAN
Take the body. Bring the boy.
Several RABBITS take a step or two forward, but Amsterdam springs up at
them, like an animal.
RABBIT WARRIOR
Come an, lad. Therels nothing to be done now.
AMSTERDAM
Get away! Get away!
HAPPY JACK
Leave him be. He's his to mourn.
And the RABBITS turn away, going back to the Old Brewery or vanishing down the narrow streets.
Now a few CITIZENS venture out into Paradise square. A couple of SCAVENGERS scoot about, looting bodies. Amsterdam stays in the center of the square unmoving, undisturbed, keeping solitary vigil over his father.

A TITLE is superimposed across this scene:
NEW YORK CITY 1844
EXT. HARBOR DAY WINTER (MATTE)
The same afternoon. As the sun goes down, we have our first full look (MATTE) at the low pale outlines of the city. The harbor is crowded with the high masts of sailing ships. Just north of the island tip is the steeple of the city's tallest structure, Trinity Church. The buildings of Wall Street are masses of concrete and wood, the streets surrounding them paved with cobblestones. Just above the financial district are the sloping buildings and rutted avenue of the Five Points . The Old Brewery stands tall and forbidding over Paradise Square.
Above the Five Points, in the distance, we can glimpse some finer, newer buildings. One wide street--Broadway--seems to run from the very tip of the island clear up into the woods just a few miles north of the harbor. The only SOUNDS are the lapping of the harbor water against the boats, the creaking of masts in the winter WIND.
CUT TO
EXT. HARBOR DAY
A closer view - The TITLE fades off. We see an imposing edifice on the edge of the harbor with a wooden sign identifying: "IMMIGRATION DEPARTMENT, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA."
The sun has nearly set. A boy--about 10 years old--sits on the edge of the Castle Garden dock, gazing down at the frozen Hudson. He can just about make out his reflection in the dull sheen of the ice. His name is JOHNNY SIROCCO, and he watches himself with bewildered seriousness.
Abruptly, he reaches down and SMASHES through the ice with his fist. In SLOW MOTION, we watch the ice fragments drift apart in the river current, each bearing away a REFLECTION of Johnnyls face, like pieces of a puzzle.
POLICEMAN
Where's your family, sonny?
Johnny sees a POLICEMAN scrutinizing him.
JOHNNY
(lilting brogue)
My mother's just there.
He gestures toward a ship, where MEN are unloading cargo. In a hoist, they are lowering a thin pine COFFIN to dockside.
13
JOHNNY
On the trip, her insides all broke up. She wasn't dead and there was
three others fighting for her bed.
POLICEMAN
And your father? Where's he, then?
JOHNNY
I never knew him.
POLICEMAN
(taking Johnny's hand)
We better see to you, then.
CUT TO
EXT. STREET NIGHT
The Policeman leads an awed Johnny through the TEEMING streets of the Five Points.
POLICEMAN
Where all those streets come together right ahead is the true Five Points.  But most speak of the Five Points and mean anywhere between the Battery and the Bowery.
Although the night's cold, the streets are jammed. WHORES painted like carnival Gypsies sell themselves to any man sober enough to stand up. SOUNDS of laughter and combat filter out from garish SALOONS like the Little Naples, the Hell Hole, the Egyptian Hall. In the midst of all this highlife are BEGGARS and the SICKLY, looking for charity, scrounging garbage in the street. An INDIGENT battles a CRIPPLE for a meager scrap of faod. A richly dressed WOMAN, riding by in a carriage, hides her eyes by raising a HUGE BOUQUET OF FLOWERS in front of her face.
POLICEMAN
Streets hereabouts are lively of an evening. The city comes here to
sport.	But there's places to put up a boy on his own.
Three WOMEN, exquisitely costed, burst from the door of the Egyptian Hall.
Under the harsh glare of a nearby gas lamp, their faces are no longer striking. Johnny STARES; there is something not right about these faces.
JOHNNY
And those? What are those?
14
POLICEMAN
Well, those. Those are, as you might say, a sort of... 
We SEE one of the women's faces, suddenly harsh under gaslight: under thickly caked make-up is a smiling TRANSVESTITE.
POLICEMAN
...  sort of whatnot.
TRANSVESTITE
Say, policeman. I'll buy your bonny friend.
The Policeman fetches the Transvestite a strong WHACK with his nightstick. The Transvestite screams and falls ...  and Johnny RUNS.
POLICEMAN
Hey!
But Johnny's off, already lost in the mad street life.
CUT TO
INT. MORTUARY NIGHT
A funeral chapel.
Vallan's body lies in state. He is wearing his gang regalia, and all the Dead Rabbits FILE PAST his coffin in solemn tribute. A WOMAN bends down and kisses the body. Happy Jack Mulraney holds Vallon's crucifix, which he has obviously inherited. As a disreputable looking Minister mutters PRAYERS, Happy Jack whispers to a silent Amsterdam.
HAPPY JACK
We passed the plate amongst ourselves. Come up with enough ned to
carry all this, and carry you a while, too.
He stuffs some money in Amsterdam's pocket.
AMSTERDAM
Where will my father rest?
HAPPY JACK
Potters Field, with everyone else.
AMSTERDAM
My father won't be buried with everyone else. He'll lie separate in
fresh ground, facing east.
15
HAPPY JACK
What difference where he faces?
AMSTERDAM
He'll face east for the second coming of Christ.
HAPPY JACK
Fine, son. When Jesus gets to the Battery you show Him the way from
there.
The Minister finishes the service. MR. CORNELIUS, a funeral director who resembles one of his own customers, ushers in a WOMAN (MAGGIE) pulling a lovely 10 year old GIRL (JENNY EVERDEKNE) by the hand. The woman is obviously drunk, the girl frightened.
MR. CORNELIUS
Will you have music, entlegen
WOMAN (MAGGIE)
My daughter'11 do any song you like.
HAPPY JACK
Not tonight, Maggie, we got... 
Monk Eastman interrupts from the Background.
MONK
How much?
MAGGIE
Any ned in your pocket, sir.
MONK hands MAGGIE some coins.
MONK
She sing sweet as she looks?
MAGGIE
Pure celestial, sir.
(to girl)
Go on, Jenny.
Jenny's voice is sweet as promised. The song she SINGS, however, is a bawdy saloon song. Maggie cuts her off fast.
MAGGIE
No, Jen, the other.
Jenny starts to sing a HYMN. To avoid looking at the corpse, she lets her eyes rove all around the chapel until she SEES Amsterdam. She looks straight at him until the hymn is over. And he does not take his eyes off her.
16
CUT TO
INT. MORTUARY HALLWAY NIGHT
Mr. Cornelius is about to escort Maggie and Jenny into another room crowded with mourners when a smartly-dressed man (DANIEL KILLORAN) gestures to him from the shadows.
KILLORAN
Mr. Tweed would like a word, Mr. Cornelius.
(Cornelius hesitates)
Tweed of Tammany.
At the mention of the name, Cornelius shoos Maggie and Jenny into the mourning room and shuts the door behind them. Then he gives Killoran his full attention.
KILLORAN
In your office. At your pleasure, of course.
CUT TO
INT. MORTUARY OFFICE
As the door opens, we see a man gazing out the narrow window onto the spectacle in the next building. He is in his late 20s, already a little fleshy but dressed with dash: WILLIAM TWEED...  "BOSS" TWEED. He shows a bemused, almost schalarly interest in the goings-on next door. This mortuary is located next to a bordello, where the windows are uncurtained and the energy and variety of the activities inside is astounding.
Tweed finally TURNS as Killoran opens the door.
TWEED
Mr. Cornelius. With a view like this I'm surprised the dead can rest
in peace.
CORNELIUS
Is there anything I can... 
TWEED
(interrupting)
Yes. A favor.
CORNELIUS
Happy to serve, Mr. Tweed.
TWEED
Excellent. Lend me something.
17
CORNELIUS
(puzzled)
Oh, I don't know what I could ... 
TWEED
I believe in form and appearance, you see. Just like yourself, sir.
And I
believe in law, and the power of example. Our city is a lawless
wilderness, sir. I'm asking you to help chasten it.
CORNELIUS
A matter of civic duty, then.
TWEED
And civic pride. I want you to help me set an example.
(smiles)
I only need to borrow one of your clients.
CUT TO
INT. MORTUARY NIGHT
Two native Americans open the door where Vallon is laid out and Bill the Butcher STRIDES into the room. There is immediate TENSION, like an electric charge, as other Natives stand in the doorway and crowd the hall stand while Bill walks over to the coffin. He places a BLACK ROSE in Vallon's folded hands.
BILL THE BUTCHER
Tomorrow your cortege will cross Paradise Square, into territory protected by the Native Americans. You will be permitted undisputed passage both ways. That is our tribute. After that, any Rabbits wishing to join the Native Americans and willing to swear blood loyalty will be welcomed. All others will be dispatched.
He starts out of the silent room, but STOPS when he sees Mank Eastman looking at him with easy interest. Bill the Butcher STARES him down, but Monk's gaze never wavers.
BILL THE BUTCHER
I'll expect you first.
MONK
Me? Oh, I don't know. All that talk of blood loyalty makes me quake.
I'll spill blood when the price is right.	But blood for ceremony?
Prefer holy communion.
BILL THE BUTCHER
You saw us fight today. You know we can pay any price.
MONK
Not mine. Not now, and not any time after.
18
BILL THE BUTCHER
We'll see. Independence is a slippery thing. But being a rival ... 
well, that's dead dangerous.
Bill brushes past Monk and leaves, followed by the NATIVES. Now the RABBITS file out, with Monk among them.
HAPPY JACK
Come on, boyo. I'll put you up tonight.
AMSTERDAM
I'll do for myself, Jack.
HAPPY JACK
You can't.
(Amsterdam stares at him)
There's no mistaking you're his son.
Happy Jack leaves Amsterdam alone in the room.
Now, by himself, sure of no one seeing, Amsterdam CRIES.
CUT TO
INT. MORTUARY NIGHT
Mr. Cornelius is seated in his office, enjoying a late supper while looking out his window at the bordello activity across the alley. A NOISE at the door disturbs him: Amsterdam.
AMSTERDAM
What's the cost to bury my father proud and proper?
MR. CORNELIUS
For a plot, a headstone, hands to break the earth... 
AMSTERDAM
How much?
MR. CORNELIUS
What are your current means?
Amsterdam turns out his pockets, which contain Bill the Butcher's pirate knife as well as the cash Happy Jack pressed on him. Cornelius TAKES it all.
MR. CORNELIUS
Of course you'll have to wait three days for a city permit. But all
this may do for part.
19
AMSTERDAM
No.
Amsterdam takes the knife back from Cornelius.
AMSTERDAM
That's owed another.
CUT TO
EXT. STREET/PARADISE SQUARE DAY
A grey day. Amsterdam stops in front of a window. He STRUGGLES with his scarf, trying to keep himself warm. His eye strays for a moment, and he sees he is outside Mr. Cornelius' Establishment. Then he NOTICES something else... his FATHER, propped up in a coffin, on public display. There is a large sign beside the body: "The Dead End of Lawlessness. Tammany Abhors Crime. Tammany Means Justice."
A sizeable CROWD is goggling at the body. Amsterdam BULLS his way through the people to the street. He looks in the gutter, then looks up quickly. Someone is watching him: Johnny. He's carrying an armful of wood.
JOHNNY
Firewood?
Amsterdam grabs the longest plank Johnny has.
JOHNNY
It's a penny the load.
AMSTERDAM
Later.
He turns with the plank in his hand and starts to RUN back through the crowd.
JOHNNY
Hey!
Johnny manages to GRAB the other end of the plank. But Amsterdam's so
strong he YANKS him right along. The Crowd YELLS as it parts for
Amsterdam, who CHARGES through using the plank like a battering ram,
with Johnny on the far end, born along by stubbornness and
momentum... toward Mr. Cornelius' window. Amsterdam SHATTERS the window
and the Crowd SCATTERS in a blizzard of GLASS.	Amsterdam stumbles
into the window and against the coffin, which falls over, spilling
Vallon's BODY, knocking the boy over. Amsterdam picks himself up as
Johnny stands frozen.
AMSTERDAM
Help me.

He starts to pull his fatherls body from the window.
AMSTERDAM
Come on! Help me, goddamn it!
In a daze, Johnny steps forward and HELPS Amsterdam pulls the body onto the street.
Now: the SOUND of WHISTLES and WHEELS and RUNNING HORSES as a wagon full of POLICE arrives on the scene. Behind them, the Crowd returns, yelling insults.
The police RUN toward the window. Mr. Cornelius dithers at the front of the crowd.
Amsterdam and Johnny exchange a look. Then Johnny RUNS for it. Amsterdam stays with the body... as the cops close in, SWINGING clubs. Amsterdam's grabbed and hit a couple of times. The Crowd yells. A COP swings his arm back to give Amsterdam a good wallop... and someone grabs his arm: Bill The Butcher.
BILL THE BUTCHER
Easy, crusher. What's this all about?
CRUSHER
Ask the boy.
AMSTERDAM
I paid Cornelius for my father to rest in honor. He told me I had to
wait on a permit, but he only wanted time to... 
BILL picks up the Tammany sign from the ground.
BILL THE BUTCHER
Make another Arrangement, looks like. For advertising.
(to cop)
Better go along. I'll see to all this.
COP
The boy... 
BILL THE BUTCHER
Take the little malefactor.
The Cops YANK the wildly flailing Amsterdam to his feet and DRAG him off to their wagon. Bill The Butcher approaches Cornelius.
BILL THE BUTCHER
Give the boy what he paid for.

EXT. STREET/PARADISE SQUARE DAY
Amsterdam is HURLED into the police wagon. The door is locked behind him. He pulls himselt to his feet, looks out the tiny barred window, SEESâ€¦Dead Rabbits join up in a rough funeral procession. SEVERAL help LOAD Vallon's body back into the coffin and place it onto Mr. Cornelius' fancy funeral wagon. Monk Eastman LEAPS up onto the wagon and closes the coffin lid tight.
There are PEDDLERS everywhere. One dispenses drinks from a portable samovar. A SAILOR hawks ships in a bottle, repeatedly shouting the same advertisement: "Encourage the work of a landswamped sailor!" A SILHOUETTE ARTIST offers to draw portraits of passersby.
Funeral music is furnished by STREET MUSICIANS: a drummer, a fiddle player, and a horn player, with a couple of BUSKERS performing along side for good measure. Mr. Cornelius takes the wagon reins and guides the horses out of the square. The gang FOLLOWS solemnly behind.
And across the square, the police wagon carrying Amsterdam starts MOVING OFF in the opposite direction. He keeps looking out the tiny wagon window. The funeral procession leaves the square and activity returns quickly to normal. Peddlers' CRIES once again fill the air. The Buskers start PLAYING a snappier tune. SNOW begins to fall.
CUT TO
INT- TOMBS DAY
A huge, awful prison building modeled on an Egyptian mausoleum. Amsterdam--trying to hide his growing fear--waits on line with other PRISONERS, all of them older than he. At the head of the line, prisoners are being processed by a JAILER and a couple of COPS. Each prisoner is asked several cursory questions, then told to strip. Every one of the men is SCARRED in some way. AMSTERDAM nears the front of the line. The MAN just ahead of him undresses. His left buttock is missing, and his back is covered with whip scars. A PRISONER behind Amsterdam WHISPERS loud enough for Amsterdam to hear
