PRISONER
Ain't his first Tombs trip.
ANSTERDAM steps up to the desk. The JAILER hardly takes notice of him.
JAILER
What do they call you?
And this is the first time in the film we have heard his name.
22
AMSTERDAM
Amsterdam.
The JAILER looks him over.
JAILER
Your full name.
AMSTERDAM
Vallon.
The JAILER writes this down with a scratchy pen.
JAILER
First name?
AMSTERDAM
I told you.
JAILER
(skeptical, resigned)
Address?
AMSTERDAM
Got none.
JAILER
I'll put city. Now what's your age?
(Amsterdam shrugs.)
Maybe twelve. Got a family?
AMSTERDAM
No more.
JAILER
Well, where was they from when you had one?
AMSTERDAM
(beat)
City.
JAILER
(writing)
Disrobe.
As Amsterdam obeys, the Jailer turns to the Cop in the leather helmet standing at his side.
JAILER
What's the charge, Asbury?
23
COP
Theft. Assault. Creating a ... 
The Jailer finishes writing. Amsterdam stands naked.
JAILER
Through that door there.

And don't stand too near no one else.
CUT TO
INT. CREMORE NIGHT
The largest, noisiest, gaudiest dive we have yet seen, full to bursting with bawdy CUSTOMERS even at this late hour. Therels a long bar, where men and women stand three deep; lots of small tables; a dance floor; and a stage on which four blowsy DANCING GIRLS are giving out with a ribald number titled "My Father's Teeth Were Plugged With Zinc."
One end of the bar is entirely taken up by a huge woaden keg with an attached hose. BAR ATTENDANTS DUMP the unfinished contents of glasses into the open barrel top as a line of FAR GONE DRUNKS wait their turn for the hose. Maggie, Jenny's mother, is close to the front of the line, very drunk, hanging on to a mush-faced HOODLUM.
Two VISITORS watch. One has a pad and makes quick SKETCHES.
VISITOR ONE
Ought to be served in a trough, properly. Will you try some?
ARTIST
Probably. What is it?
VISITOR ONE
All-Sorts. It's made of all that's poured and not drunk, and any they
can
salvage that's spilt.
Maggie GRABS the hose, staring at the Artist as she takes a drink. His hand moves quickly an the page, SKETCHING her.
VISITOR
(to Maggie)
Your health.
She SPITS at him, insulted. The Artist steps forward, puts some of the All-Sorts from the hose into his glass, and toasts Maggie. She nods and turns away... as Johnny enters, dragging a large SACK across the crowded floor toward a far door.

CUT TO
INT. CREMORE BACK ROOM NIGHT
Johnny RUSHES toward a wooden pen in the center of the room. There are cries from the crowd of SPORTSMEN of "Hurry it up" and "More speed!" Johnny dodges a kick or two before he finally arrives at the pen.
He UPENDS the sack over the pit and a dozen live RATS tumble out. A GAMEMASTER slips Johnny a couple of cents as he starts his spiel.
GAMEMASTER
Alright, gents and ladies, your bets now on Towser against the vermin,
the count to beat is ten rodents in three minutes.
The crowd starts to place bets. A sleepy Johnny settles down close to ringside to watch the show.
At a signal from the Gamemaster, a TRAINER tosses TOWSER--A fierce mongrel--into the ring. The crowd cheers lustily, continuing to shout out bets, as the dog goes after the rats.The rats, fighting for their lives, bite the dog, attaching themselves to his body. Towser retaliates by gnawing the rats, SNAPPING them in half and spitting them out.
As the CROWD cheers, and Towser kills, and money changes hands, Johnny curls up and goes to sleep.
CUT TO
INT. TOMBS NIGHT
A row of cells, noisy and cold. The GUARD shoves Amsterdam into a cell.
GUARD 2
You get to live private until they come from the orphan's asylum. On
account of your tender years.
There is nothing in the cell but a board for a bed, and a window through which Amsterdam can see the late winter moonlight. He looks for stars in the sky, but can see none.
CUT TO
INT- MAIN ROOM/OLD BREWERY
Jenny Everdeane and a girl FRIEND, her own age, huddle together in a dark corner of this huge space. The Friend opens her hand to show Jenny a glimpse of what she's clutching: a penny.
25
JENNY
Let me see! I don't believe it.
FRIEND
(closing her hand)
No! It's a danger.
JENNY
Oh come on! It's not.
(Friend shakes her head)
Then tell me where you got it.
FRIEND
From some man. He took me in his carriage. He only wanted to do
something
to me fast.
JENNY
What?
FRIEND
(shrugs)
I didn't understand.
JENNY
Would he do the same with me?
FRIEND
I won't tell you if he's around again.
(clutches penny tight)
He's my secret.
JENNY
Better keep it more careful, then.
The Friend GETS UP and starts across the Brewery floor, acting nonchalant. But she looks around her, across the sleeping, passed-out bodies, past the desperate families and their squalling infants, to see if she's been noticed.
A man and two women cast a glance her way. She looks away, but the TRIO keeps watching her...  then FANS OUT and starts to FOLLOW her. The Friend looks over her shoulder again. SEES the Man. Locks in another direction, SEES: the woman. And then: the second woman. All closing on her. The Friend starts to RUN. The Trio runs after her. And no one else pays attention. The Friend PLUNGES into one of the warren of TUNNELS that lead off the Brewery floor. CAMERA plunges through the darkness, after her. Her footsteps ECHO; there
is the SOUND of stumbling, falling, an angry CURSE and a BLOW being struck. The FRIEND picks herself up out of the darkness and keeps running, CAMERA following down the dank halls.
26
Suddenly the TRIO runs AHEAD of the camera. There is a SCREAM. CAMERA staps. And others SOUNDS follow quickly now: the dull THUD of a heavy object against bone, REPEATED several times; and then, very soon after, the most terrible sound of all: silence.
Then Two Women emerge from the darkness of the tunnel, fighting over the penny. The Man, several steps behind them, throws an object to the dirt floor: it's a STONE, and it is covered with blood. He comes up behind the
Two Women quickly and GRABS the penny from them with a hand that still DRIPS blood and gore. They CHASE after him across the crowded Brewery floor.

INT. HALLWAY/TAMMANY NIGHT 2
CAMERA races along the ornate corridor, past PORTRAITS of many affluent and self-important GENTLEMEN...  through a door and into... 
INT. TWEEDIS OFFICE/TAMMANY NIGHT
...  Tweed's domain. Small in size, but there are dozens of CAGES OF CANARIES all around. Tweed looks up startled as the door flies open. The birds set up a COMMOTION.
CAMERA bears down on Tweed as a pair of HANDS grabs him and hurls him against the wall.
Bill The Butcher GLARES at Tweed. Some NATIVES come into the room behind him.
BILL THE BUTCHER
You come into the Five Points and you stole from me.
TWEED
I don't know... 
BILL THE BUTCHER
You stole Vallon. He was my kill. My example, of my power. You took
him
and made him yours.
TWEED
You're a lunatic to come here like... 
In the background, same of the NATIVES have begun to play CATCH by removing the CANARY CAGES from their places and tossing them all over the room.
27
BILL THE BUTCHER
Thank you. Just listen good. The Native Americans holds the Five
Points.
We have prevailed. What you do outside the Points is your deciding. Outside is your city. Inside the Points is mine. Anyone who says different, or does different, or thinks different...  (smiles)
...  theyâ€™ll draw my unwelcome attention. You understand?
BOSS TWEED
I do understand, yes.
BILL pushes him away and starts out.
BOSS TWEED
But you don't understand at all.
Bill keeps walking.
BOSS TWEED
There's a whole city to share and all you see is your own narrow
streets.
BILL THE BUTCHER
(turns now)
You just stay out of my place.
BOSS TWEED
Yes, alright. Gladly. It's all blackjack jobs and panel games and
killings for a fiver.
Bill waits for Tweed to continue. But Tweed stoops and tries to soothe a canary in a cage.
BILL THE BUTCHER
It's good work.
BOSS TWEED
As far as it goes.
BILL THE BUTCHER
You wouldn't be talking to me otherwise.
BOSS TWEED
But we're talking about different things, Bill. You describe the
present.
I see the possibilities. Look to the future. There is so much more.
The Butcher starts to look interested.
CUT TO
28
INT. TWEED'S OFFICE NIGHT
Later. The Natives have cleared out; only Tweed and the Butcher remain.
The cages have been restored to their proper places and the room has been straightened. Bill stands beside the door, while Tweed relaxes in a chair.
BOSS TWEED
There's things demanding to be done that no police force can do, not
even
an obedient one. There's contributions from every dive and brothel.
Loyalties to be secured and debts to be collected.
BOSS TWEED (Cont'd)
And now you and your Natives have emerged as the foremost force in the
Five Points, I'm prepared to extend you an opportunity. You can work
for
Tammany... 
BILL THE BUTCHER
We work for no one.
BOSS TWEED
...  beside Tammany...  in the performance of these civic obligations.
And
for a satisfactory...  I'm prepared even to say equitable...  financial
participation. It's not the sort of responsibility the founding
fathers
might have recognized. But then, the founding fathers never imagined
the
city New York has become.
BILL THE BUTCHER
Maybe you Tammany boys should do your own lifting and carrying and
muscle
work. Might build you up.
BOSS TWEED
We'd like to. I do miss it. But it's wiser for men in the public life
to
give an appearance of probity.
BILL THE BUTCHER
Then get cops to do it.
BOSS TWEED
Oh Jesus, no. The appearance of law must be upheld, especially while
it's
being broken.
29
BILL THE BUTCHER
Appearance means nothing.
BOSS TWEED
Perhaps not within the Points. But the smart man could go higher.
Bill looks at Tweed for a long moment. The he SHOVES himself away from the wall, pulls away the chair on which Tweed has been resting his feet and sits down close to him.
BILL THE BUTCHER
If you can talk plain, maybe we can do business.
EXT. STREET NIGHT
A small slum thoroughfare congested by a splendid FIRE-WAGON labeled "Americus Co./Tammany Hall." Curious SPECTATORS and panic-stricken RESIDENTS crowd around to watch a ramshackle building going up in FLAMES.
As Johnny presses through the crowd to get a good look at the fire, Tweed, in a white coat and fancy fire helmet, steps off the fire wagon to address an ONLOOKER.
TWEED
Anyone inside?
ONLOOKER
No, praise God, but all we own... 
TWEED places a bucket over the only fire plug in the vicinity, then
sits
on it.
ONLOOKER
Well?
TWEED
Waiting on reinforcements.
The SOUND of another bell, nearby. Down the street from the opposite direction come TWO MORE FIRE-WAGONS. The crowd starts cheering. Tweed does not move from the plug.
TWEED
That's not them. It's only the Black Jokes. Seems your fire
interrupted their festivities.
The wagons pull up next to the fire plug. Each of them has the words "Black Joke Fire Co." written large on the side, but the FIREMEN wear party costumes, not regular uniforms. Some are dressed as British
30
Redcoats, still others as Indians.
The FLAMES continue to devour the building, but Tweed does not budge from the plug. He is approached by the Black Jake chief, who is dressed as an Indian chief.
CHIEF
May I point out that the building is burning to ashes?
TWEED
Certainly. And may I then remind you, Pocahontas, that this entire area is the province of the Americus company, and you will kindly keep your distance.
Impasse. The rival Fire Companies size each other up and start toward each other. The building continues to burn. Tweed remains regal and unperturbed atop the fire plug. As the two COMPANIES are about to close with each other, a second BELL sounds. Tweed's "reinforcements" have arrived: the Native Americans, led by Bill The Butcher. They PILE OFF the wagons before the horses halt. Now the Black Joke Co. is outnumbered, and it FALLS BACK. As the Crowd CHEERS, Tweed takes the bucket off the fire plug.
TWEED
Alright, boys! To work!
The MEN of the Americus Co. give a great SHOUT and start firefighting: a hose is hitched up to the plug, buckets are filled, a primitive pump sends water spluttering everywhere.
But there is not much blaze left to combat and the Men quickly grow frustrated. Tweed realizes this immediately.
TWEED
Next building over, boys! Mustn't let it spread!
The men charge into a neighboring building, STOMPING down doors, CLIMBING through windows and SWINGING AXES with gusto, all to save a building that is in no danger at all.
A local poll named DANIEL KILLORAN detaches himself from the crowd and approaches Tweed, giving him a hearty SLAP on the back.
KILLORAN
Another proud night for Tammany, Bill.
TWEED
Just tell them... 
(lowers his voice)
...  to take enough to share. And not to steal so in the open.
31
Indeed, the Men are leaving the building with lots of LOOT. CITIZENS who question their right to do this are promptly KNOCKED DOWN. Killoran GRABS Bill The Butcher as he rushes by.
TWEED
Jesus! Boss says to tell you to fight the fire from the front and loot
out
the back.
Bill grins and leaves to spread the word as an angry WOMAN approaches Tweed.
TEARFUL WOMAN
The Black Joke could have saved my house!
TWEED
Black Joke had no business here, Madam.
TEARFUL WOMAN
Their business was to save my house!
TWEED
Tammany's your business. When we're here to call upon there's no need
of other. We understand loss, Madam, and take care of our own.
As Tweed leads her off, away from the blaze and the thieving, he passes a boy sitting an the curb, watching the fire ...  and watching Tweed ...  with admiration. It's Johnny.
The FLAMES light up his EYES as we...

INT- ROOM/HIGH BRIDGE ORPHANS ASYLUM 2
Amsterdam, eyes wide, lying on a cot in the middle of a long room crowded with KIDS - This place is a step or two up from the Brewery-- but not a big step. He stares at the ceiling, eyes grave, untroubled by the small cries of loneliness and fear that come from some of the beds surrounding him. As we move CLOSE on his EYES we...

EXT. HIGH BRIDGE ORPHANS ASYLUM DUSK
...  the same eyes. But OLDER. Smart and full of savagery. It is Amsterdam. He is now in his early 20s, fully grown and no man to trifle with. Moving with jungle stealth and strength he ... BURSTS out the door within the massive frame of a great iron gate over which hangs the sign "High Bridge Orphan Asylum." He starts to RUN and a TITLE comes up... 1852.
Pursued by GUARDS, Amsterdam runs hell-for-lather for a long vaulted bridge. It's a beautiful, stern old Romanesque span across the Harlem River with rolling banks of leafy trees on the far side. Even in the twilight, we can see that it is late spring, the end of a long afternoon.
CUT TO
EXT. HIGH BRIDGE DUSK (MATTE)
Amsterdam is on the bridge. But he does not slow up until ... two orphanage GUARDS suddenly TACKLE him. A THIRD GUARD beats him with
a billy club. Amsterdam moans and curses, as much from frustration as pain.
SECOND GUARD
It's Blackwell's Island certain now, boyo.
The SECOND GUARD pulls AMSTERDAM up by the hair.
THIRD GUARD
Are you hurting? Let's hear you!
Amsterdam won't give him the satisfaction. The Guard hits him. Amsterdam goes down, biting his lip so he won't cry out. Instead, he forces a SMILE.
SECOND GUARD
There's nothing funny, boyo! You been beat and turned back four times
now.
AMSTERDAM
But every time you bring me back...  you got to come further to catch
me.
CUT TO
EXT. CORLEAPS' HOOK PIER NIGHT
Through the THICK FOG comes a ghostly apparition: a tattered SKULL AND CROSSBONES, made of rags, fluttering from the mast of a leaky, unstable vessel.
33
The bow of the small boat breaks the fog, and on board we see: a hulk called SHEENY MIKE KURTZ and a huge black kid named JIMMY SPOILS, manning the cars. Johnny Sirocco, grown wary and wiry, peers into the fog like a
lookout, while Shang Draper, at the tiller, looks anxious. The HULL of a large boat suddenly laoms in front of them, not five yards away.
JOHNNY
Hard starboard, Shang! Hard starboard!
SHANG
(panic)
I told you forget that sailor stuff! Which way's star... 
Too late. Their Ticket craft crashes into the side with enough force to make a LOUD THUMP and to send Shang sprawling.
SHEENY MIKE
(sarcastic)
Why don't we just knock on their front door?
Shang gestures for QUIET. They wait and listen. No sound from the deck of the boat above them. The boys throw two ROPE LADDERS over the rail of the larger ship and start climbing.
CUT TO
EXT. SHIP NIGHT
The boys board the ship and gather on deck. They look around uneasily, spooked by the silence and the fog.
SHANG
Spread out and make for the cabin.
Moving slowly, the boys FAN OUT and move toward the cabin at the far end of the deck. Johnny stays close to Shang, holding onto the shipls rail for support.
SHANG
(whispering)
Nothing. Looks picked clean.
Johnny stops. His hand, on the railing, is BLOODY. On the other side of the deck, Sheeny Mike discovers more traces of blood and SIGNALS Shang.
SHANG
Bill and the Natives must have got here first.
Johnny freezes in terror.
34
SHANG
What ... 
A long SHADOW falls across his shoulder. Shang jumps.
Standing before him, holding a musket and covered in blood, is the ship's CAPTAIN. A BUTCHER'S CLEAVER is imbedded between his neck and shoulder. With his dying energy, the Captain takes AIM at a petrified Shang and fires his musket.
Jimmy Spoils JUMPS the Captain from behind, sending the musket ball way wide. But the SOUND of the musket is thunderaus, and echoes through the harbor. The boys panic and head for the side.
SHEENY MIKE
That'll bring the Harbor cops for sure.
JOHNNY
(about the dead man)
Wait! Take him. If he's still alive he's good for ransom!
SHEENY MIKE
Hels dead as Good Friday, can't you... 
JOHNNY
Then we'll take Bill the Butcher's cleaver and sell the body to the
medical students. They'll go five dollars for it anyway.
SHANG
Come on. We'll get something out of this.
Shang and Johnny start DRAGGING the body. Pushing, pulling and mostly panicked, the others help. As they boost the body over the side, the SOUND of a bell cuts through the fog.
SHEENY MIKE
The Harbors!
Shang shoves the body off the side and into the boat. It lands with a resounding THUD. The boys CLAMBER after it.
CUT TO
EXT. BOAT/RIVER NIGHT
PUSHING OFF with cars, tearing their rope ladders from the side of the ship, stumbling over the captain's body, the boys slip off into the fog.
The Harbor Police are so close to them they can see a police LANTERN shining. The boys stay absolutely still. Suddenly, WE SEE: the POLICE BOAT, breaking through the fog, then DISAPPEARING again.
35
SHEENY MIKE
We can't go back to Corlears Hook, they'll be watching... 
SHANG
We'll make for Blackwells.
JIMMY SPOILS
And which way's that through this fog?
Johnny throws his hands up for quiet. From close by comes the SOUND of COP'S VOICES. They are near. Very near. The boys stay as still as they can... and the VOICES recede again in the thick fog.
JIMMY SPOILS
Should have asked them directions as they drifted by, Shang.
SHANG
You'd have liked that, wouldn't you Coal Face? You're the only one
they'd
miss in the dark.
SHEENY MIKE
Let's quiet, or we'll all be found out!
As the BOYS stay still, their boat DRIFTS against an outcropping of
land
and STOPS.
SHANG
Alright. We lay up here till first light. Then we run back across the
river.
JIMMY SPOILS
(contemptuously)
River pirates!
Spoils settles back and tries to sleep. Johnny watches Shang in the bow. Shang is too agitated to notice Johnny's stare. He looks away, waiting for the sun.
CUT TO
EXT- BLACKWELLS ISLAND DAWN
Shang drowses in the boat, fighting fatigue, then succumbing to it. But h's brought awake suddenly by a loud SPLASH. He looks in the direction of the noise, SEES ... the BODY of the slaughtered ship's captain floating away in the company. He starts to cry out but Amsterdam GRABS him, locking his throat in the crook of his arm.
36
AMSTERDAM
(to everyone)
Push off! Or his pipe snaps!
The other boys are too stunned to resist. They push the boat away from
the
island.
AMSTERDAM
Head straight out, then turn for the current.
He pushes Shang away from him. The two boys stare at each ather, finally remembering... 
SHANG
(breathing hard)
Figured you for dead.
AMSTERDAM
Close enough.
SHANG
This is my crew. And welcome to join, if you've the mettle. We're
river
pirates and quick thieves and street brawlers... 
AMSTERDAM
(casual disdain)
You're lost.
SHANG
Yeah? You've no business saying anything against us! Do you know how
much
you cost us? You know how much that body's worth?
AMSTERDAM
I doubt it's worth the water it's floating in.
SHANG
Fifteen dollars! Fifteen dollars from them medical ghouis.
AMSTERDAM
I'll make it back for you whatever it is, once we're in the city. Just
keep sailing, or we're all done for.
SHANG

Go ahead then.

He was in his prime. He'd have fetched thirty dollars easy.

CUT TO
INT. HIDEOUT DAY
A ramshackle room near the docks. It is part meeting hall, part living quarters for the gang, and part clearing house forstolen goods. SHANG presides over a boisterous meeting.
JIMMY SPOILS
You're as flat as Broadway going north. We can't run the river no
more.
We're poaching the Natives and the Harbor cops are looking for us.
SHANG
The cops can go to blazes. Who cares about them?
SHEENY MIKE
Youlre all sand when it comes to cops, Shang. But do you have the sand
to
go against the Natives?
SHANG
It ain't the time to go against the Natives. We've got to build first.
Then we go.
JIMMY SPOILS
If we go like we did in the river, all of us'll sink.
Amsterdam is sitting off to the side, watching this ongoing debate with contemptuous detachment. Johnny sits next to him.
AMSTERDAM
Does Shang have the sand to ever go against the Natives?
JOHNNY
I don't know. He acts like it.
AMSTERDAM
If he only acts, held be better on the stage.
(looks away)
Like her.
His tone of voice has changed. Jenny Everdeane passes before him; she's ravishing. Amsterdam STARES, as if he's trying to see into her heart. Jenny pays him scant attention as she moves across the room toward Shang.
JOHNNY
Jenny Everdeane. Shang turned her into the best bludget in the Points.
Jenny gives Shang silk scarfs, wallets and several purses from her coat.
38
AMSTERDAM
Shes his mort, is she, as well as his best provider?
JOHNNY
Yeah. But Jenny says she's anyone's she chooses.
Jenny's haul is impressive. Shang picks a BRIGHT RED SILK SCARF with a distinctive PAISLEY design from the pile of stolen goods. He examines it with a shrewd, appreciative eye.
SHANG
That's the prize of the month. Spice Islands silk.
He puts the scart in his coat pocket with a FLOURISH, then throws his arm about Jenny in a proprietary way.
SHANG
You'll learn our way if you're going to be one of us, Amsterdam.
Jenny reacts slightly to the mention of the name: she looks over and RECOGNIZES Amsterdam now.
SHANG
Every one of us gives a portion of all they steal to the gang. Morts
more
than men, being morts.
AMSTERDAM
Yeah? And why is that?
SHANG
Because morts have more resources. Men can work only on their feet,
but a mort can turn out on her back.
AMSTERDAM
I mean, why give at all? Why don't they keep for themselves?
SHANG
If you think there's something off about my way of running things, you
got no place in this gang.
AMSTERDAM
I got no place anyway, and you got no gang. This ain't a gang, no
matter what you say. It's a mob.
There's a tense hush in the grubby room. Shang takes his arm from around Jenny, wanting to be restrained.
JENNY
(smiling)
It's all your play now, Shang. Maybe you can set him right.
39
Jenny hands him a cane. Barely managing to hide his reluctance, he starts--slowly--toward Amsterdam, who stands his ground. The gang steps back to give them room in this tiny space. Shang pulls the cane apart: it's a SWORD CANE, but Amsterdam shows no fear. He shifts his weight a little, watching ...  and they're interrupted by a... 
VOICE (HAPPY JACK)
You boys settle with me before you settle each other.
They turn to him.
HAPPY JACK
I've come for my due and proper, Shang.
Happy Jack Mulraney (the Dead Rabbit gang member with the halfparalyzed face) stands before them in a POLICEMAN'S UNIFORM-sparkling clean and splendid--a leather helmet and long coat. In his hand, he twirls a NIGHTSTICK.
SHANG
As agreed, then, Jack. Refreshment?
Shang OPENS the top of the gold-handled sword cane. Inside are large, solid LUMPS of cocaine. Jack reaches for the choicest.
AMSTERDAM
Still smiling, are you?
HAPPY JACK
(sizing him up)
It's the young Vallon, is it? I hardly recognized you.
AMSTERDAM
I hardly knew you under that hat, Jack.
By now, Jack has taken not only the cocaine, and the money and swag Shang offers, but several of the purses and wallets Jenny delivered. Jenny stares at him with contempt, and he laughs, tossing one of the purses back at her.
JACK
There. For your respect.
Jack turns to leave but a BRASH BOY blocks his way. Moving fast and
fancy,
Jack bashes the Boy to the floor with his nightstick.
HAPPY JACK
Anybody else? Any number at all, come on.
40
Several of the gang make a move toward Jack, but Shang WAVES them back. Jack departs UNHARMED, to general disgust. Jenny walks back across the room to help the Brash Boy. Shang GLARES at Amsterdam, slides his sword back into his cane and follows Jenny, trying to explain himself.
AMSTERDAM
Is that sand we've just seen?
JOHNNY
It's politics.
CUT TO
EXT. PARADISE SQUARE DAY
A hot summer day. All the TRADESMEN are out in force, jamming the square and the side streets leading to it. Amsterdam walks fast through the crowd, enjoying the freedom and the bustle, as Johnny tags along close behind him.
AMSTERDAM
I've got my own way to go, why don't you find yours?
JOHNNY
Because your way's different, and I want to see where it goes.
(Amsterdam looks at him)
Unless you say otherwise. Amsterdam shrugs and keep walking.
JOHNNY
You act like you have something in mind, like you know every day what
you'll be doing the next. Me, I don't figure on tomorrow.
AMSTERDAM
Well, if you shut up a while maybe it'd come on its own.
(he stops, looks)
Now what the hell's that?
JOHNNY
(following his glance)
Oh that's heaven.
WE SEE what they're looking at: the Old Brewery. In worse shape than ever before, but shut-down, abandoned. A tattered banner flaps against the front door: "Future Home of the Five Points Mission/ Praise God!/ The Reverend Shadrach Raleigh, Pastor."
JOHNNY
The city shut down the Brewery as unfit to live and Tammany gave it
over to this minister.
41
AMSTERDAN
What's Tammany?
JOHNNY
Why Tammany ...  you don't know? Tammany makes the city run. A
political organization that's like...  like the Native Americans, only
ranging over the whole city.
CUT TO
MONTAGE
As Johnny continues to speak, we see Tammany tactics in action: WARD-HEALERS dispensing coal to the poor, and TOUGHS stealing meat off of butcher's wagons; a political PARADE with fife and drum-and politicians--including Boss Tweed--in ceremonial Indian costume, and a group of GOONS busting up a saloon; Tweed making a speech to enthusiastic CONSTITUENTS and a Tammany Fire Company tearing through the streets, scattering everyone in their way, finally revealing they are not rushing to a fire but are CRASING OFF a rival fire company.
JOHNNY
They seem like the law, but they got a way of acting outside the law. Anything that happens in this city, on the straight or on the sly, Tammany's a part of, and Boss Tweedls the heart of Tammany.
CUT TO
EXT. PARADISE SQUARE,/OLD BREWERY DAY
Amsterdam studies Johnnyls enthusiastic face.
JOHNNY
They're the best gang there is.
AMSTERDAM
So if Tammany's the best, go with Tammany. What are you running with
this
mob for?
JOHNNY
'Cause they're more my size for now. With Tammany, you got to do
something
large, something that makes them take notice of you.
AMSTERDAN
You're better oft without their notice. You can run free, work your
own
schemes.
JOHNNY
But if your schemes have size, you need size to bring them off.
42
AMSTERDAM
What are you thinking?
Johnny shrugs, grins: he doesn't want to give anything away. Amsterdam understands, turns toward the Brewery.
AMSTERDAM
Let me in if you ever get it figured.
Amsterdam starts toward the Old Brewery, Johnny keeping step.
AMSTERDAM
I'll go on my own from here.
Johnny STOPS and Amsterdam continues on by himself.
CUT TO
INT. MAIN ROOM/OLD BREWERY
Echoing. Dank. Amsterdam holds a candle high for light. RATS skitter.
He crosses the main floor, enters one of the side tunnels.
CUT TO
INT. ROOM/OLD BREWERY
A tiny room we recognize from the first scene: this is the place where Amsterdam lived with his father. He crouches and TEARS UP some floorboards, then quickly LOWERS HIMSELF into the hole.
CUT TO
INT. UNDER FLOOR/OLD BR.EWERY
A short tunnel under the Brewery floor, the kind a kid might make. Amsterdam has trouble crawling through it. DIRT and ROCK sprinkle him until he finds what he wants stuck in a shallow hole; a battered leather MONEY PURSE; and a PAPER-WRAPPED PACKAGE.
Amsterdam snaps open the purse to make sure the little bit of MONEY is still there, then turns his attention to the package. He TEARS it open. Inside is the PIRATE KNIFE that Bill the Butcher used to kill Amsterdam's father.
Amsterdam handles the knife carefully as he opens it. The candle light makes the blade GLEAMS.

CUT TO
EXT. ALLEY/OLD BREWERY DAY
A shock of summer SUNLIGHT as Amsterdam emerges from one of the back entrances of the Brewery onto a fetid alley filled with rotted barrels, broken glass and insensible drunks.
Amsterdam looks carefully up and down the alley, letting his eyes adjust to the bright light. Ahead of him, he SEES ... 
Shang Draper, in jovial conversation with a SECOND MAN we do not recognize. The man is bareheaded, and has a deep scar running back to front clear down the center of his bald head. Amsterdam waits, WATCHES.
Shang takes the RED SILK SCARF he got from Jenny's swag and hands it to the Second Man. He and Shang SHAKE HANDS, as if they have concluded a business deal, and the Second Man walks away.
Amsterdam PRESSES himself close to the door as Shang LOOKS AROUND... 
doesn't see Amsterdam...  and walks off in the opposite direction, across Paradise Square.
CUT TO
INT- RECEPTION ROOM AND TWEED'S OFFICE DAY
The main room is as loud and as prosperous as the stock exchange. Bill the Butcher makes his way past Small GROUPS of men engaged in heated political dealings of dubious virtue.
Bill knocks on the door to Tweed's private office while he's opening it. Inside is Boss Tweed, seated in a large WOODEN BOX like a primitive sauna.
Around him are various PETITIONERS, and his assistant Daniel Killoran.
TWEED
I dread city stimmers. They bring illness and beget vermin.
PETITIONER #l (GLEASON)
My plague box fends off all pestilence. Its elixir combats ill
humors... 
KILLORAN
We can't have every citizen of the Five Points boxed up like cargo.
TWEED
But the season is vicious, and I must take thought of our
constituents.
Mr. Gleason, I'd like you to shake hands with Mr. Barnett Baff... 
44
Gleason, dubious, shakes hands with PETITIONER #2 as Bill the Butcher looks on with amusement.
TWEED
A friend and owner of an estimable carting service. Work out an arrangement whereby the citizenry can receive the benefit of Mr. Gleason's
wondrous elixir outside this excellent box. At a cost, Mr. Gleason, of
how
much the barrel ... 
GLEASON
(figuring rapidly)
Oh, perhaps twenty-five dollars.
TWEED
... and how much, Mr. Baff, for haulage and distribution... 
BAFF
The same again. At least.
TWEED
At least. That's a price of fifty dollars. And greedy, low piracy at
that
(Gleason and Baff splutter)
But a price that Tammany, in its generosity, will meet. Merely submit
a
bill for a hundred. We'll each have half. And I'll retain this box for
further experiment. Hello, Bill.
Killoran LEADS the astonished Gleason and Baff away as Bill APPROACHES.
TWEED
Bolt the door.
Bill complies. As Tweed speaks and the anti-plague VAPORS SWIRL around his head, he keeps his eyes closed.
TWEED
Scotchy Lavelle's gone wrong in his accounts.
BILL THE BUTCHER
I know. Scotchy's a good man.
TWEED
Not good enough to rake thirty percent of our share from Sparrow's and
use it for his own.
(opens his eyes)
You got to give him over, Bill.
45
BILL THE BUTCHER
I can't do that. No matter what he steals, I still get more from him
than any two others. As do you.
TWEED
Alright then. What about Charles McGloin? He's running a panel game
off to one side. Did you know that?
(Bill shrugs)
I can't get a day's work done for all the good citizens pouring in
here complaining about crime and corruption all over the Points. They
accuse Tammany of carelesoness. Some even suspect ...  a few
practically suggest.
(eying Bill significantly)
...  our complicity with this rampant criminality. We must show them
Tammany stands behind the letter of the law. We need to set an
example.
BILL THE BUTCHER
(beat)
Charles McGloin will do.
TWEED
I'll set the trial for Friday.
CUT TO
44 EXT- TOMBS DAY
CAMERA moves high along the outside wall, past small rectangular slits that pass for jail windows. EYES peer out, as if a peep show is underway directly below in the Tombs courtyard. A PRISONER is being readied for the gallows by having a hood tied to his head.
The CROWD is in a carnival mood; HOT CORN GIRLS, STREET VENDORS, "HOKEY-POKEY" (i.e., ice cream) MERCHANTS, even BUSKERS, all add to the holiday spirit.
Jenny works through the crowd, pushing and smiling her way past groups of raucous merrymakers. She stops once or twice to have a word with a GENTLEMAN, flirts for a moment, then moves on.
Further back in the crowd, Amsterdam NOTICES her. He watches her go through the crowd with an admiration that quickly turns to FASCINATION as he realizes what she's doing: picking pockets. The best bludget in the Five Points. He starts to FOLLOW her.
Jenny has worked her way close to the hanging platform, but she's so intent on her job she has not noticed Amsterdam. The closer the platform, the closer the spectacle and richer the pickings: Jenny's concentration is absolute. On the platform, an ASSISTANT HANGMAN addresses the Crowd.
