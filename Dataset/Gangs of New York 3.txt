ASSISTANT HANGMAN
Those interested in the effects of the condemned please come forward.
Part of the Crowd PRESSES in toward the platform, temporarily blocking Amsterdam's view of Jenny. He is right against the platform.
ASSISTANT HANGMAN
What am I bid for this coat? A coat of some wear but excellent cut... 
containing a rather remarkable pocket silk... 
MAN IN CROWD
Bid a quarter!
HANGMAN
A quarter, thank you. Do I hear fifty cents? Fifty cents?
The Hangman is holding up the condemned man's coat which contains the
RED
SILK SCARF Amsterdam saw Shang give away. Amsterdam flips the HANGMAN
a
quarter, reaches out and GRABS the handkerchief.
AMSTERDAM
Here. Just for the silk.
He stuffs it into his pocket and starts to PUSH his way through the crowd. On the platform, the WARDEN steps forward holding a primitive megaphone.
WARDEN
Do you have any last remarks, Charles McGloin?
McGloin grunts from underneath the hood.
MCGLOIN
Not from under this hood I don't.
Crowd near the platform begins to CHANT "No hood, no hood, no hood!" The Warden puts his hand on the hood, starts to remove it... and the Crowd CHEERS. Amsterdam turns, SEES: Charles McGloin. Bald, with a deep scar running front to back on his head. The very SAME MAN he saw in the alley with Shang.
McGloin acknowledges the cheers of the crowd. The Warden holds to megaphone close and McGloin bellows... 
MCGLOIN
I never struck a foul blow or turned a card and may God greet me as a friend!
The Crowd ROAR approval at these words. Amsterdam PUSHES through the crowd, looking for Jenny ...  SPOTTING her finally... while up on the
47
platform, the NOOSE is placed around McGLOIN's neck, and he is HOISTED UP in no time. We hear his neck SNAP. His feet kick after death. The Crowd raises a zighty cheer.
CUT TO
EXT./INT. BROADWAY AND BROADWAY STAGE DAY
Amsterdam walks with a crowd toward a waiting Broadway stage, a vehicle that looks like a horsedrawn train car. The stage will take spectators back uptown from the hanging.
He is working his way toward Jenny, who is now BOARDING the stage. Amsterdam DASHES through the crowd and SQUEEZES onto the stage, which moves forward with a JOLT.
Once on board, Amsterdam looks through the jammed car, SEES: Jenny, about to sit down - A MAN has offered her his seat. She smiles dazzlingly as she sits... and arranges her hands genteelly on her lap. The Man looks down on her and she smiles up at him again. He is bequiled.
Amsterdam manages to get a little closer.
MAN
I hope you won't think me rude if I speak.
JENNY
No, sir. You look a proper Gentleman down to the ground.
As this conversation continues, we watch-not only Jenny and The Man in conversation, and Amsterdam watching them; but we begin to notice what Amsterdam SEES. Although Jenny's hands apparently remain folded on her lap, her RIGHT HAND moves SLOWLY out from her wrap...  toward The Man... 
MAN
Well, I wouldn't want you to think me forward, you see.
...  and BRUSHES past his jacket. He does not notice or feel a thing. Jenny's hand GLIDES past his THIGH ...  nearly brushing it ...  moving up across his pelvis and around his buttocks... 
JENNY
Does it matter to you what I think?
MAN
Well, I might like it to.
JENNY
Oh.
48
... toward his pocket. The Man is in Jenny's thrall. He feels nothing and continues to have no idea what is going on. But Amsterdam KNOWS. Every silken, surreptitious move of her HAND across The Man's body is like a CARESS that Amsterdam can feel. Jenny's grace is balletic and EROTIC. As she picks The Man's pocket, she is, without knowing it, also seducing Amsterdam
MAN
I mean, if you would like.
JENNY
I might like, sir. But I can't say now.
Her hand HOVERS above his pocket, waiting for the SWAY of the stage to
match and mask her movement... .
MAN
Why?
...  and she starts to get up as soon as the stage JOSTLES. The entire car full of passengers LEANS into one another... and Jenny's hand SLIDES the Man's WALLET from his trousers as he recovers his balance. Amsterdam watches her withdraw her HAND in a flash and hide it beneath her wrap.
JENNY
Because this is my stop.
MAN
May I walk with you a little, then?
JENNY
(firmly)
That would be too bold.
MAN
But I'll never see you again.
JENNY
I come every Thursday to the Tombs to see my father.
MAN
I'll look for you.
Jenny fetches him another fine SMILE--it's almost demure--and takes her way off the rear entrance of the stage.
lt PULLS AWAY up Broadway and Jenny walks briskly toward an alley.
49
CUT TO
EXT. ALLEY/BROADWAY DAY
Jenny looks to make sure she has the alley to herself, then moves her body a little... and her arms seem to come off. She has been wearing a set of ARTIFICIAL ARMS, hollow inside, which she can leave folded on her lap misleadingly while she goes about her pickpocketing.
She's folding up the appliance--cotton sewn over a soft form-when a VOICE behind her makes her turn.
AMSTERDAM
May I walk with you a little, then?
CUT TO
EXT. BROADWAY DAY
As Jenny and Amsterdam walk through the noisy bustle of the city's main thoroughfare.
JENNY
Are you a spy, then?
AMSTERDAM
Got no one to spy for. I'm an appreciator, you might say.
JENNY
Appreciator of what?
AMSTERDAM
A good touch.
She STOPS in the street, looks him straight in the eye.
JENNY
Don't bother with the chat. If you want me, we come to a business arrangement. lf the terms is right, then I decide how you suit me. Then I do it or not.
AMSTERDAM
Just take a minute, I was Just... 
JENNY
I know what you was just. I had years already of what you was just. You know how I got so good at thieving? So's I wouldn't have to lay down for everyone who had the ned. Now I do it when I want to for how much I want to. Otherwise I don't do it, and don't have to do it, and to hell with anyone's rules but my own.
50
AMSTERDAM
What about Shang's rules? You pay a lot over to him. The better your
day,
the better his. It don't seem gute right.
JENNY
(a little curious now)
What's it to you?
AMSTERDAM
Give him this.
He hands her the RED SILK SCARF. She recognizes it instantly as the
same
one she gave Shang.
AMSTERDAM
And you can keep a little more of what you earned.
JENNY
How'd you come by this?
AMSTERDAM
I got my own touch.
JENNY
Are you making me a present, or making an Arrangement?
AMSTERDAM
It's your rules, right? So you decide.
She looks at him for a moment, then starts to TIE the scarf around her neck like a kerchief.
CUT TO
INT. HIDEOUT
A gentlemen's WALLET skims across a pitted wooden table, straight into Shang's hand. Jenny is giving him her CUT. He opens the wallet, looks up at Jenny. No more goods are forthcoming. Amsterdam, hanging back, watches them both.
Shang SEES the RED SILK SCARF, tied around her neck.
SHANG
Pretty slim cut for a hanging day. Where'd you get that?
JENNY
From Amsterdam.
51
SHANG
(beat)
It don't suit you.
CUT TO
EXT. STREET AND PARADISE SQUARE NIGHT
A SWELTERING evening. The streets are jammed with REVELERS and RESIDENTS. Some people sleep in doorways in futile search for fresh air. Happy Jack Mulraney leads a group of apprehensive UPTOWN CITIZENS past drunks and whores.
JACK
Commissioner Brunt said to spare you nothing concerning conditions.
CITIZEN
Nothing but our safety, of course.
JACK
All's snug around Paradise Square in my company, squire. See there.
He gestures toward the street, down which one oi Mr. Barnett Baff's CARTS is being drawn by a team of WHEEZING NAGS.
The cart bears massive barrels of what a colorful banner advertises as "an anti-pestilence influenza-thwarting solution...  a service of Tammany Hall." As the wagon draws abreast of a large group of languishing RESIDENTS, HOSES spurt waves of solution all over the streets. Many people are SOAKED. Jack and his Citizens jump back just in time.'
JACK
Tammany makes the streets nanitary, I make 'am safe.
WOMAN CITIZEN
(apprehensive)
Even against them?
A small distance behind the anti-plague cart, moving in rough formation, come some of Shang's mob, heading aimlessly across the Square cruising for action
JACK
Against them especially. Let me demonstrate.
Jack takes out his GOLD WATCH AND CHAIN, which he HANGS carefully over a nearby lamppost. Then, very casually, he leads the Citizens off.
JACK
We'll be back for this at our leisure.
52
WOMAN CITIZEN
You dare leave it here?
JACK
Safe as a vault, lady. Since all knows it's mine.
The Gang draws abreast of the lamppost. No one makes a move to take the watch until one of the YOUNGEST BOYS reaches out ...  but
Shang knocks his hand away. Jack, at a distance, NODS approvingly.
SHANG
You know that's Jack's.
BOY
So what?
AMSTERDAM
It should be hangin' off Jack's vest, then. Not here, like some war
flag.
SHANG
That watch is a small price for free run of the Points.
AMSTERDAM
If it's free, how come we pay so much? Wo shouldn't pay for what's our
due.
SHANG
We don't tight when we don't have to. It's not warring that counts.
It's
the living day to day.
ANSTERDAM
(smiles)
Is that right? Did I hear that correct? John, did we hear that
correct?
Eyes now on Johnny. Jenny looks at him with great interest.
JOHN
(uneasy pause)
We heard the same.
AMSTERDAM
So then.
He reaches for the watch.
53
CUT TO
EXT. STREET AND PARADISE SQUARE NIGHT
Happy Jack stands at the lamppost, aghast. A WOMAN lowers her head and retches. Jackls watch and chain are still in place.
But the watch has been SMASHED. And hanging from the chain is a BLACK CAT, skinned and strangled.
CUT TO
51 INT- HIDEOUT
Happy Jack stands with his Citizens. The room QUIETS as, one by one, the mob notices him.
JACK
You!
He GRABS the Young Boy who had reached for his watch on the lamppost and starts to BEAT him.
JACK
What'd you do to my watch, you dirty little bastard... 
Jack breaks the Boy's hand with his nightstick. The Boy SCREAMS and FAINTS. So does one of the Women in the group. Jack takes the Boy's other hand.
JACK
Hands won't be so quick in future.
SHANG
That's enough sport this evening, Jack.
JOHNNY
(stepping forward)
It wasn't him.
All turn to look at Johnny. Jack drops the Boy's hand.
JOHNNY
I have word for you from who did it. You're to meet him at Sparrow's
Chinese Pagoda.
CUT TO
INT. SPAPROW'S CHINESE PAGODA NIGHT
A low and lunatic place: a combination of an opium dream out of the Arabian Nights and a panel from a Bosch triptych. FAN-TAN games played by Orientals; WOMEN and CHILDREN of various colors suspended in cages
54
from the ceiling as MEN and WOMEN in a secondfloor GALLERY point at them and JOKE. On the main floor, a long line waits for a shot at the barrel of All-Sorts. Jack charges in the front door, looks around.
JACK
All right, step out, you yellow... 
All the NOISE subsides. Only the Fan-Tan game continues; nothing is so interesting that these Orientals will stop gambling. Now Amsterdam STEPS right in front of him. It's a grandstand play.
AMSTERDAM
Hello, Happy Jack. I'm the one you're looking for.
JACK
Then you're marked for dead.
Jack lunges ahead, swinging his NIGHT STICK. Amsterdam throws a chair across his path. Jack stumbles, goes down, dropping his night stick. Amsterdam grabs it, jumps on top of him, HITS him twice on the side of the head. There is a CRACKING SOUND. The PATRONS of the Pagoda gather round.
CUT TO
INT. SPARROW'S CHINESE PAGODA NIGHT
Later. Festive again. And no sign of Amsterdam.
Two PATRONS step away from the all-sorts barrel. Hanging from the spigot like the cat from the watch chain is the BODY of Happy Jack Mulraney. The belt has been removed from his trousers, tied like a NOOSE around his throat, then looped over the spigot. His TEETH lie scattered on the floor around him. His NIGHT STICK has been jammed down his throat.
CUT TO
EXT. DOCKS/HIDEOUT NIGHT
Amsterdam holds the FANCY COAT from Jack's uniform over his arm. Carefully, he DRAPES the coat over Jenny's shoulders. SHANG steps forward.
SHANG
I gave no order for this.
Amsterdam says nothing at first, just holds his hand out: he's holding the RED SILK SCKRF.
55
AMSTERDAM
(very quietly)
Never mind giving orders. What were you giving this for?
SHANG
I'm calling you out, Amsterdam.
AMSTERDAM
I got this at the hanging. It was Charles McGloin's. Everybody here
saw
you take it from Jenny. What was MCGloin doing with it? What'd you
give it
to him for?
SHANG
I didn't give it to him. Why would I give it to him?
AMSTERDAM
I gaw you give it to him. Last week, behind the Old Brewery.
SHANG
(to group)
He's gone flat. I got no reason to trade with the Native Americans.
AMSTERDAM
What about stepping up in the world, as it were, and leaving the rest
of
us behind. There's a reason. Making a separate arrangement for
yourself
with the one Native so stupid and luckless that he got hung. That's
you to
the ground, Shang.
SHANG
(very edgy now; to group)
Who believes what he's saying? Can any of you believe what he's
saying?
AMSTERDAM
Bene. We'll see. Any of you that believes I did proper by Happy Jack Mulraney tonight, stand beside me. Any of you that still likes Shang's way
with the cops, and Shang's way with the Natives, go to him.
(to Shang)
Or should we settle right now, you and me, and just see which of us is
left standing?
SHANG
Let see where they stand.
Jenny rises, stands next to Amsterdam. Jimmy Spoils, Johnny, Sheeny Mike are next. Now the other members of the mob move in clusters to all STAND with Amsterdam.
56
AMSTERDAM
What's your pleasure, Shang?
One of the YOUNG BOYS has a dead rat blackjack hanging from his belt. Shang grabs it. He BITES the head oft the rat and spits it across at Amsterdam. Amsterdam almost smiles at him. Shang sneers, drops the body of the rat, and LEAVES.
AMSTERDAM
This mob ever have a proper name?
JOHNNY
We was called after Shang when we was named at all.
AMSTERDAM
We're the Dead Rabbits from now. They were the best. They were
history.
They were legend, and we'll live up to them.
CUT TO
EXT. DOCKS/WATERFRONT NIGHT
Amsterdam sits on an empty pier, watching the ships in the river.
There's a SUDDEN RUSTLING NOISE as a NOOSE coils around his neck.
It's Jenny. She's slipped the SILK Amsterdam gave her close to his throat, and she's TIGHTENING it. Amsterdam starts to resist. Then he sees how's she's looking at him.
She uses the silk to bring his face closer to hers. She KISSES him.
AMSTERDAM
What's this then?
JENNY
Payment for the silk.
Then DROPS the silk from his throat and starts to touch him. Then his hands are under her skirt. Then, under the cloudy moonlight, they start to make love.
CUT TO
EXT. DOCKS/WATERFRONT NIGHT
Later. Amsterdam pulls Happy Jack's uniform COAT over Jenny to keep her warm in the chill air.
JENNY
You were waiting for me out here, weren't you?
57
AMSTERDAM
Maybe I was, yeah.
JENNY
You was that sure of me?
AMSTERDAM
Sure enough to wait, anyway. Waiting don't cost nothing.
JENNY
It don't do to be sure. I could go away just as easy.
AMSTERDAM
Alright.
He sweeps the coat away from her body, allowing her to leave.
JENNY
I'll say when I want to, not you.
AMSTERDAM
Stay then.
(beat; smile)
One way or another, I get what I want.
JENNY
(looking at him)
Yeah. If it was just a shag you wanted.
AMSTERDAM
You're a gypsy, are you, come to tell my fortune? Go ahead then. Tell
me
what I'm wanting.
JENNY
You got blood in your eye for someone.
AMSTERDAM
It's just I can't look away, that's all.
JENNY
Who from?
AMSTERDAM
Bill Poole.
JENNY
You better get someone else in your sights. No one's ever taken him.
58
AMSTERDAM
'Cause he's mine, that's why. I'll take his one eye, and then the rest
of
him, piece by small piece.
JENNY
You have a plan for this? You going to raise a militia? I'll wager
Bill
the Butcher don't even know about you or care if he does.
AMSTERDAM
He'll know about me soon enough.
JENNY
And after the Butcher?
AMSTERDAM
You.
JENNY
Is that so?
AMSTERDAM
You'll be in love with me.
JENNY
Love you? You just had me. You can have a mort any time you want. So
why
look for more than that.
AMSTERDAM
That's taking love, not giving it. I want it to be just you and me, no
one
else for either.
JENNY
Why?
AMSTERDAM
'Cause none of us means nothing in life except one to the other.
JENNY
I don't know I want to mean something, to you or anybody. Can there be
good in that?
He stares at her.
AMSTERDAM
We'll see.
Jenny pulls the coat tighter around her.
59
JENNY
It'll take a while if we do. If we ever do.
AMSTERDAM
And what about the meantime?
JENNY
Meantime's business.
CUT TO
EXT PARADISE SQUARE DAY
A CROWD gathers in one of the main thoroughfares bisecting the 5 Points. A beefy SPEAKER is making an anti-Irish speech on behalf of James W. Barker, a mayoral candidate supported by Tammany's current rivals, the Know-Nothing Party. Hand-painted signs are everywhere, bearing Barker's unsavory likeness. A couple of BUSKERS provide a musical score for the political spiel.
SPEAKER
The potato is a thick vegetable. Heavy. Meaty. Comes out of the ground dirty and stays that way unless you scrub it and boil it to death! (cheers and laughs from crowd)
We don't want to keep lem out of the country! We'll even give 'em a
place
at our table! But we ain't gonna vote 'em into office.
Much CHEERING and jovial approval from the Crowd. On its fringes, Amsterdam and the Dead Rabbits make their way roughly across the Square.
SHEENY MIKE
Any Irish hears that will be out for blood.
AMSTERDAM
The Irish is too busy building up Tammany. That's where their brains
and
muscle goes. Once they're inside with their cronies, they turn on
their
own outside. Tammany'd steal the air and rent the daylight if they
could.
SHEENY MIKE
We'd do the same.
AMSTERDkM
Not against our own we wouldn't. That's the difference.
JOHNNY
Tammany earns better. That's the difference.
60
AMSTERDAM
I ain't seen their ned yet.
Johnny stops walking, betraying slight annoyance that he has to explain the day's deal.
JOHNNY
You will at day's end, that's our arrangement. A quarter a voter,
whether
they're repeaters or not. I'm telling you, we got a square deal.
SHEENY MIKE
It's sound, Amsterdam.
AMSTERDAM
Yeah? Well, it's ned anyway. Just make sure you count it when we get
it.
JOHNNY
It's just a day's job, we don't have to make it a life's work. We work
for
Tammany today and kill them tomorrow, if that's our pleasure.
JIMMY SPOILS
So we're politicians just for today.
AMSTERDAM
Not for a minute. We're better than that. We're thieves.
CUT TO
MONTAGE
The Dead Rabbits go about the business of rounding up Tammany voters. They pick up DRUNKS in alleys; Jenny and some of the Dead Rabbit MORTS raust PATRONS in a whore house; Rabbits shanghai SAILORS from saloons; corral CITIZENS as they walk along the street, either wheedling or bullying to get them to vote. It's the strong arm of democracy.
CUT TO
EXT. POLLING PLACE DAY
On one side of the door, some Dead Rabbits, with a RABBLE of potential voters; on the other, POLICE doing their best. Behind and all around, various WARD HEELERS and SMALL-TIME POLITICIANS, representing both the Know-Nothing candidate Barker and Tammany's Fernando Wood. Varicus factions push and pull at one another as they wedge their VOTERS into the polls.
61
JIMMY SPOILS
He's got the right to vote, damn you!
COP Not four times he don't.
(shoves a Voter)
There'll be no damned repeaters here!
The Cop and Jimmy play tug-of-war with a besotted VOTER, while other gang members rush to GRAB VOTERS leaving the polls.
PANDEMONIUM.
CUT TO
INT. TAMMANY HALL DAY
The main floor is jammed with CLUBMEN and PARTY RACKS. Daniel Killoran bustles from group to group, making promises, taking notes and searching out Boss Tweed, who is holding court in a far corner, surrounded by JOURNALISTS.
BOSS TWEED
I would never speak ill of a rival. I would never say that every Know-Nothing is a horse thief. It is my observation, however, that every
horse thief is a Know-Nothing.
Good-natured LAUGHING all around. Even TWEED seems amused. Killoran catches the Boss' eye and whispers to him.
KILLORAN
The Know-Nothings are already finished, and there's four more hours at
the
polls yet.
BOSS TWEED
Keep our men voting. Everybody works today. It's not a victory we
need,
Daniel. I want a triumph.
CUT TO
INT. DON WHISKERANDOSO BARBER SHOP DAY
Amsterdam roughly deposits REPEAT VOTERS in the barber chairs, as the BARBERS work FRANTICALLY to cut their hair, prune beards, and otherwise alter appearances. As soon as one customer is done, Sheeny Mike douses him with bay rum and pushes another REPEATER down in his place. Johnny keeps count of the turnover.
DON WHISKERANDOS (BARBER)
Now that's eight...  and how many still to come ... 
62
He looks toward the door, where more Repeaters are lined up, waiting their turn under close supervision.
REPEATER
I already voted once today. Cast for Tammany, by God, and Fernando
Wood.
AMSTERDAM
Once? Come here and do your duty.
Amsterdam GRABS him and SLAMS him down in a chair.
CUT TO
INT. FAN-TAN PARLOR DAY
Amsterdam and some RABBITS BURST into the front door, frightening and scattering all the Chinese GAMBLERS.
AMSTERDAM
(barking orders)
Line up like soldiers!
SHEENY MIKE
They got no notion what you're talking about.
AMSTERDAM
(To Johnny)
You explain their democratic right. Illl see they unterstand.
Amsterdam GRABS the nearest two CHINESE by their PIGTAILS and HURLS them against the wall.
CUT TO
INT. OPIUM DEN
Amsterdam and the Rabbits PROWL the murky darkness where OPIUM EATERS lie in bunks stacked high against the walls. The Rabbits start ROUSING and rounding up the Opium Eaters. Jimmy Spoils SLINGS a couple over his shoulder like flour sacks. Amsterdam SHOVES two more out the door, past an admiring Daniel Killoran.
KILLORAN
(to Johnny)
I come to see if our counts square. You boys have made a remarkable
showing... .
AMSTERDAM
Who the hell's this?
63
JOHNNY
He's our Tammany man.
Killoran compares his figures to the piece of paper where Johnny has
been
keeping his own count.
KILLORAN
...  remarkable... 
AMSTERDAM
(With an edge)
Our own Tammany man. We are coming along. Happy to meet any friend of
Johnny Siroccols.
KILLORAN
Likewise. Pleasure to meet the best but one in the whole Five Points.
AMSTERDAM
Best but one? Who's better?
Killoran looks up. Johnny, standing behind Amsterdam, SHAKES his head "NO" VIGOROUSLY. Killoran gets the message.
KILLORAN
(smooth)
Maybe nobody. But when the count's done the numbers will tell who's
come
out in front.
AMSTERDAM
I'm in no race. Just pay us what you owe.
KILLORAN
Tonight. At the victory celebration.
CUT TO
INT. SPARROW'S CHINESE PAGODA
A Tammany victory celebration. When we last saw this place--as Amsterdam confronted Happy Jack--the place was busy, alive. It's RIOTOUS now, jammed to bursting with POLITICIANS, CRIMINALS, GANG MEMBERS, MORTS, WHORES, HANGERS-ON, UPTOWN THRILL-SEEKERS, JOURNALISTS and COPS, not all of them off duty. The SOUND of the place is a cacophony of SHOUTING, SINGING, GAMBLING and STRANGE MUSIC--which we can't identify at first. We START CLOSE on a huge ruby ring and we HEAR... 
64
BOSS TWEED
(V.O.)
Read what it says there, alongside the ruby... read it out ... and WE
MOVE OUT as a WELL-WISHER reads the Latin inscription.
CONTINUED:
WELL-WISHER
"Fortuna Juvat Ordentes."
TWEED
A grand victory gift from the men of Tammany. Now, tell 'em what it
means,
Mayor Wood.
WOOD
"Fortune favors the bold."
TWEED gives him a resounding slap on the back.
BOSS TWEED
What do you think? Would that make a fit motto for our fair City?
WOOD
Well, I could certainly see ... 
KILLORAN
(interrupting)
We've got a motto.
BOSS TWEED
what is it?
(no one knows)
Well, hell, let's get one we can remember. We're going to build a new
City
hall, we better have something to put over the front door. And Mayor,
you'll make sure the Latin's right?
As Wood nods his assent, CAMERA MOVES across room... past the gilded CAGES suspended ten feet over the floor, where the women and children look down at the action just below them with a mixture of trepidation and resignation. Occasionally a REVELER will jump up to try and GRAB one of the caged inhabitants. Still MOVING, CAMERA... passes a stage, where we finally SEE the source of all the strange MUSIC we've been hearing: the music is provided by
CHINESE MUSICIANS, a woman SINGER, a DANCER and some ACROBATS. They perform some weird, mangled Five Points version of Chinese opera. The music and performance continues as we MOVE PAST... across a PEWTER FAN-TAN TABLE, where CHINESE GAMBLERS play with fierce animation and
65
concentration. By comparison, the Occidental types playing beside them seem like tourists.
Everyone SHOUTS and SCRAMBLES to place bets with the FAN-TAN DEALER.
Above the Dealer is an oval opening in the ceiling, through which OTHER PLAYERS may watch the action below. These FAN-TAN PLAYERS lean over an elegantly carved rail, peering at the action on the table below, placing their bets and collecting their winnings by means of a BASKET attached to WIRES that whirrs constantly overhead. We continue to MOVE PAST... until we are at the door of the place, where Amsterdam, Johnny and the Rabbits are having words with a BOUNCER.
BOUNCER
I don't know you, you don't enter.
AMSTERDAM
(enjoying himself)
Come on, what are you saying? If you don't know us now, you'll know us
tomorrow and you'll be working for us next week.
JOHNNY
(more temperate)
Daniel Killoran knows us.
BOUNCER
Oh he does?
JOHNNY
We work for him.
AMSTERDAM
The hell we do.
JOHNNY
(to Amsterdam)
Tampen down, will you?
BOUNCER
Why don't you all get the hell out of here and go fix on a story? Go
on!
He SHOVES Johnny, who STUMBLES back into Amsterdam. They're both mad now, and they step forward together toward the Bouncer... until Killoran intervenes.
KILLORAN
(to Bouncer)
It's all right, Nat. They're saying the truth. They gave a good day's
work
for a good wage.
66
Killoran HANDS OVER a paper-wrapped parcel of money, which Amsterdam takes firmly.
KILLORAN
A fine first showing. But second best.
AMSTERDAM
Second, eh? You don't say so.
KILLORAN
It's no shame to be bested by veterans. The Native Americans always
sweep
the field.
AMSTERDAM
What?
KILLORAN
We count on them sure as mass comes an Sunday.
AMSTERDAM
(to Johnny, glaring)
Did you know this? Is this some scheme of yours?
JOHNNY
No, I didn't have no idea ... 
AMSTERDAM
I was working the same side as the Natives? The Natives?
KILLORAN
That's only right. Bill the Butcher's our ambassador throughout the Points, as you might say. It's deemed an honor to work with him. Everyone
knows Bill Poole, everyone fears him, everyone ... 
AMSTERDAM
I sure as hell don't fear him. And I sure as hell won't stand with
him, or
any who calls him one of theirs.
KILLORAN
Well, if it's matter of personal honor, the money can only be a
further
insult. I have no wish to rile you further, so if you'll allow me... 
He REACHES to take back the parcel of money, but Amsterdam BATS his
hand
away.
AMSTERDAM
Where is he? Where's Bill the Butcher?
67
KILLORAN
Listen, buck. This is a Tammany night. If you and Bill Poole have
matters
to settle, you can do it any other time, any other place, I don't give
a
good dancing goddamn. But you do it here tonight and all the Five
Points
will be down on you like the righteous wrath of heaven. or you could,
as
the Book says, put away childish things. Join the celebration.
Personally,
I always find the least strenuous solution the most appealing. Don't
you?
Amsterdam stares at him as we... 
CUT TO
INT. SPARROW'S CHINESE PAGODA
As a CHINESE ACROBAT TWIRLS in the air, off the stage, and lands in the middle of the audience. The crowd is raucously appreciative as the Acrobat does GYMNASTIC MOVES among them... past a table where the Dead Rabbits have settled. it is later in the evening, and everyone has been drinking. Amsterdam, sullen, intense, WATCHES ... Bill the Butcher, across the room. He is like a prince regent. Everyone
pays him court, including several uniformed COPS, TAMMANY HANGERS-ON, and NEWSPAPERMEN. Bill receives the attention as his due... while Amsterdam keeps watching, contempt and hatred gleaming in his
eye. He pays attention to none of the gang around, including Jenny.
Johnny takes advantage of the situation.
JOHNNY
I got experience. It's the education I lack.
JENNY
And you heard I was a good teacher?
JOHNNY
I don't listen to talk, I figure for myself. And I figured you'd be
good
at everything you did.
JENNY
That's right.
JOHNNY
And tonight I got the ned.
JENNY
And now what?
68
JOHNNY
Now I'm ready for you. Unless there's an arrangement between you and
Amsterdam.
JENNY
(glancing over at Amsterdam)
Not to my thinking.
JOHNNY
(needs to be sure)
Amsterdam...  listen up, Amsterdam... 
Amsterdam glances over at them.
JENNY
(to Johnny)
You going with me or him? It's my thinking matters here. You don't
have to
ask him nothing.
AMSTERDAM
What?
JOHNNY
(makes his decision)
How's the evening passing?
AMSTERDAM
Fine. Why?
JOHNNY
(puts his arm around Jenny)
'Cause it's treating me fine too.
She gets up and starts toward the stairs to the second floor, Johnny following her, holding her hand. As they pass Amsterdam he LEANS toward Jenny.
AMSTERDAM
This is no game, you and me. Don't go on like it's a game.
JENNY
I said already, it's not a game. It's business.
Johnny pulls her away. As he watches her go through the crowd,
Amsterdam's gaze falls on Bill the Butcher again... and for the first
tine their EYES MEET. Bill's eyes rest on Amsterdam, take him all
in...  but DON'T REMEMBER him. He looks away as a TAMMANY HACK steps up
to pay court... and a MASTER OF REVELS, center-floor, SHOUTS ... 
69
MASTER OF REVELS
Gentlemen and gentlewomen, if you please ...  we will now...  raise the
cages and start the bidding!
The Crowd CHEERS and KIDS PULL on a series of ropes and pulleys to RAISE the CAGES further above the floor until they are parallel with the second-floor gallery of the Pagoda. WOMEN AND MEN call out BIDS even as the cages rise through the air. Depending on their age, the Women and children inside the cages respond to the auction with grim resignation, trepidation or fear. A few, drugged or drunk on all-sorts, lie insensible in their impossibly cramped space.
Johnny and Jenny make their way along the second floor gallery until she spots a COUPLE LEAVING a room and walks inside. Johnny CLOSES the door behind them as a BURST of APPLAUSE... rises from the main floor, where Bill the Butcher stands in the dead center of the room. He slowly removes his coat and hands it to a FLUNKY.
He is wearing his battle vest underneath, and it is fully rigged with all his butcher's implements.
The place QUIETS. KIDS swarm silently, like busy ants, all over a huge wooden CHANDELIER, LIGHTING its HUNDREDS of CANDLES. Only the noise from the Chinese playing fan-tan in the far corner of the room can be\ heard now.
The Kids finish lighting the candles and the chandelier is RAISED toward the Pagoda ceiling, casting the whole place into a new riot of LIGHT and SHADOW as The Butcher prepares himself.
Now the Chinese Opera DANCER steps forward and stands near Bill. He NODS. The unsprung MUSIC begins. The DANCER starts to move, sinuously... and Bill, with amazing skill, starts THROWING his KNIVES. The knife MISSES the Dancer by a hairsbreadth, landing in the floor near her foot.
She doesn't flinch. She keeps dancing. And Bill keeps THROWING... the KNIVES, which follow the Dancer around the room in a careful, deadly choreography. They land just inches from where she has just been, or will be: in a wall; a pillar; the apron of the small stage; the bar; the barrel of all-sorts. After each knife LANDS, kids retrieve it. When one of the KNIFE KIDS pulls the blade from the all-sorts barrel, DRUNKS knock each other over to drink from the stream that flows from the hole.
Native Americans, meanwhile, WORK THROUGH the awed, attentive Crowd. They AVOID Cops, Tammany Members and anyone who looks too prosperous or too sober. But when one of the Natives SPOTS a MARGINAL CITIZEN, they GRAB his hand and examine it as if they were telling fortunes.
Center floor, Bill pulls TWO KNIVES out, BALANCES one in each hand ... 
as a WHORE in the crowd pushes a guy who's groping her toward a couple
70
of Natives. Hels wearing a large RING. As soon as the Natives SEE the ring they throw their arms around the GROPER like a long-lost pal and escort him to Bill ... who THROWS both knives rapidly at the Dancer.
They land on the floor, inches from her dancing feet. She SPINS AWAY to great applause as the Natives bring the Groper to Bill.
BILL THE BUTCHER
Evening, sir. Are you prepared to be celebrated? Are you ready to be
famous?
GROPER
How much will it cost?
BILL THE BUTCHER
Just a moment of your time. My men will assist you.
They do quite a bit more than that: they GRAB the Groper and KNOCK him to the floor. In the crowd, one SPECTATOR turns to his companion.
PAGODA SPECTATOR
Watch this careful. I've never seen the like, not even in Barnum's
Museum.
The Groper CRIES OUT as the Natives PIN HIM to the floor, SPREADEAGLED. Bill has one weapon left...  in a special pocket, inside his vest. It's his CLEAVER. He takes it out slowly, SAVORING the moment.
The Pagoda goes QUIET. Only the gambling continues. The MUSIC dies. The only SOUND beside the noises of the Chinese at their fan-tan is the Groper, who HOLLERS for help as soon as he sees the cleaver.
Bill HEFTS the cleaver in his hand, feels its weight, calculates timing, figures distance ... . and starts THROWING it in the air... 
CATCHING it by the handle ...  then throwing it again...  higher, FASTER and HARDER with every toss.
BILL THE BUTCHER
(in full control)
What's it so quiet for? I don't need quiet.
The Chinese opera MUSIC commences with a dissonant CRASH... and Bill catches the cleaver again. But EVERY TIME he throws it and
every time he catches it by its handle ... he also MOVES CLOSER to the terrified Groper. Now...  standing very close...  he gives the cleaver a mighty toss ... sending it SPINNING high in the air...  up past the cages ...  past the second-floor gallery, jammed with appreciative spectators until it SLOWS seems to HANG in the air...  then starts its descent... FALLING FASTER...  towards Bill's waiting, STEADY HAND.
