The Groper SCREAMS in fear. Bill SMILES confidently, holding his hand out until ...  just as smoothly, just as confidently... he PULLS his
71
hand AWAY and the cleaver FALLS with terrific impact on the SPLAYED HAND of the Groper, cleanly SEVERING it at the wrist. The
Groper FAINTS dead away as a TREMENDOUS CHEER greets Bill's amazing feat.
One of the Natives TOSSES Bill the severed hand. Bill SLIDES the ring off the finger and TOSSES it to the Chinese Dancer.
BILL THE BUTCHER
There's for your beauty and your song.
The Dancer puts the ring on her finger and DANCES OFF. Bill TOSSES the hand to the floor and walks back to his table. The Crowd PARTS, murmuring compliments on his dexterity, and the Knife Kids reverently RETURN the Butcher's implements.
Now two DOGS from the rat pit in the back room RUN through the crowd and FIGHT FRENZIEDLY over possession of the bloody hand.
The Crowd PASSES the Groper overhead and WE SEE from ABOVE: the Groper's unconscicus BODY being passed from hand to hand. The Crowd looks like a wave bearing the body toward the door. The Groper's stump BLEEDS on them as he passes overhead, sprinkling drops of blood and flesh like a moveable sacrament.
Bill approaches his table, acknowledging the continuing adulation, and is about to sit down when a VOICE rises above all others.
AMSTERDAM
Mr. Poole!
Bill turns, searching out the voice ... 
AMSTERDAM
Bill Poole!
And SEES Amsterdam, standing at his own table. His attitude is calm, smiling, respectful. But his eyes are demonic.
AMSTERDAM
My compliments on your exhibition, sir.
BILL THE BUTCHER
Thank you, sir.
AMSTERDAM
It was like watching a dance.
(Bill nods his thanks)
Some great grand goddamned dance. (Bill looks at him more closely)
You know me, sir.
72
BILL THE BUTCHER
Do I? Are you missing a finger?
Appreciative laughter from the crowd.
AMSTERDAM
No. A father.
The laughter turns a little uneasy. Bill the Butcher sizes up the younger man.
BILL THE BUTCHER
Do you have a name?
AMSTERDAM
Amsterdam.
BILL THE BUTCHER
That's a New York name.
(suddenly smiles)
shall we drink to it?
AMSTERDAM
Indeed.
(they drink)
And to my other name. Vallon. Will you drink to that?
BILL THE BUTCHER
Priest Vallon's son?
(Amsterdam nods)
Of course I'll drink to that. Your father was a worthy man.
AMSTERDAM
Not worthy of you. Those dogs ain't worthy of you. You ain't worth
what
they feed on, and what they shit's too good for you.
DEAD QUIET. Absolute. Breathless. Only the Chinese Gamblers at their fan-tan ignore this confrontation.
BILL THE BUTCHER
What do you want, boyo?
AMSTERDAM
I got to give you something, Butcher. Something from my father.
Amsterdam PULLS OUT the piratels knife which Bill the Butcher used to kill his father almost 12 years before.
BILL THE BUTCHER
You got the sand to draw a blade in front of me? You will make good
sport.
73
Come ahead and give it here, you son of a bitch.
And Amsterdam THROWS the knife, the bright blade FLASHING OUT of his
hand
like lightning.
And just as quickly the Buitcher PICKS UP his table, sending glasses flying and breaking, using it as a SHIELD... 
...  and the knife THUMPS into it dead center. The Butcher HEAVES the table at Amsterdam... sending PATRONS yelling and SCATTERING.
Amsterdam LEAPS out of the way of the table, then RUNS AT Bill the Butcher... 
...  who's already coming for him. As they CLASH and GRAPPLE with each other... 
...  PATRONS all over the Pagoda crowd around for a good view of the action
and start to MAKE BETS on the outcome. The odds do not favor Amsterdam.
And neither does the fight. Amsterdam fights with real blood lust, but he doesn't have the Butcher's skill, or experience, or dispassion. He breaks the Butcher's CLINCH...  HITS him once in the face...  then a second time...  and then gets FLOORED by a well placed kick. The Crowd cheers.
And, on the second floor, Jenny and Johnny come out of the room. Still arranging her clothes, Jenny looks over the gallery rail onto the floor below, sees the fight...  and starts to RUN down the stairs. Johnny WATCHES her go ...  looks at the fight again, for a second...  then follows Jenny to the main floor.
The Butcher is on top of Amsterdam now. He HITS him upside the head with the wood and brass handle of his cleaver. Then hits him again. AND AGAIN.
In the Crowd now, Jenny finds Sheeny Mike.
JENNY
The Butcher'll kill him if we don't do something.
SHEENY MIKE
It was Amsterdam's own doing. And it'll be our death too if we try to
stop
it.
JOHNNY
(finally catching up)
74
That's the truth.
JENNY
The truth is you don't give a damn about him.
SHEENY MIKE
Yeah, well, if he gave a damn about us he wouldn't have called out the
Butcher in the first place.
Jenny looks at him with contempt, then STARTS into the crowd. Johnny grabs her ARM but she pushes him off.
On the floor, Bill uses the FLAT SIDE of the cleaver to SMACK the barely conscious Amsterdam on one side of his face...  then on the other... REPEATEDLY...  until Amsterdam is barely sensible. Bill grabs him by the hair. Amsterdam's body is slack.
BILL THE BUTCHER
What do you say? Loin or shank? Rib or chop?
The Crowd YELLS their choices. Jenny tries to PLUNGE through toward Amsterdam, but a HALF-DOZEN MORTS and WHORES put hands on her and HOLD her back.
BILL THE BUTCHER
Come on, let me hear you!
(the Crowd yells louder)
You're all talking at once, I can't hear you!
(a near frenzy)
I don't hear the choicest cut! The best, the vital!
(they quiet a little to listen)
The heart. I think I must have the heart!
This is greeted with the biggest CHEER of the night. The newlyelected Mayor Wood seems to feel as if he should do something to stop the slaughter, but Boss Tweed calms him with a single dismissive GESTURE. Even the Boss himself is excited by the prospect of this ritual sacrifice.
BILL THE BUTCHER
Come on, look at it! You fancy yourself a gladiator, act a gladiator!
(raises his cleaver)
Watch the death blow when it comes to you. Go to hell with open eyes!
Bill the Butcher readies himself to deliver the blow...  and a HAND GRABS his wrist, STOPPING his arm.
Who would dare do this to Bill the Butcher? Bill turns, incredulous, to look into... 
...  the untroubled face of Monk Eastman.
75
MONK EASTMAN
It's been a full evening's fun now, Butcher. It's enough.
BILL THE BUTCHER
You got nothing to do with this, Monk.
MONK EASTMKN
Well I'm the game warden, you might say. I'm telling you this buck's
too young yet. Wait till he's aged for a proper kill.
BILL THE BUTCHER
The hell.
With his gigantic strength, Monk actually PULLS the Butcher off Amsterdam and onto his feet.
MONK EASTMKN
Just settle yourself Bill ... 
...  and he part SHOVES, part THROWS Bill back a good twenty feet.
MONK EASTMKN
...  and let the merrymaking continue.
The Dead Rabbits have scampered forward, and they're picking Amsterdam up off the floor. Monk looks at Jenny and Johnny, who each have Amsterdam by an arm.
MONK EASTMAN
It was his father took me in first, and it's thanks I'm returning now.
BILL THE BUTCHER
Eastman!
MONK EASTMAN
(ignoring Bill)
This squares any debt. Get him out of here.
BILL THE BUTCHER
Monk Eastman!
As the Rabbits CARRY Amsterdam toward the door, Monk finally turns his attention back to Bill.
BILL THE BUTCHER
I'll have you then!
MONK EASTMAN
Come ahead, Bill. Unless you're wanting to shout me to death.
76
And Bill comes forward, BRANDISHING his cleaver. Monk Eastman stands his ground, unmoving, untroubled. Everyone looks on in awe at this contest ... except Boss Tweed.
BOSS TWEED
(to Killoran)
If these two are going to combat, it aught to be a worthier occasion.
And more rewarding for all.
Tweed SIGNALS to Bill: STOP. The Butcher sees the signal but can't believe it. He SHAKES his head. His blood is up. He won't stop.
Tweed SIGNALS AGAIN. Bill KEEPS COMING.
Tweed signals Killoran, who STANDS himself. And, when he stands, every COP and TAMMANY LOYALIST in the place--a hundred of them anyway--STAND behind Boss Tweed.
As Bill keeps coming, and Monk stands easy, waiting... 
...  the Natives and their ALLIES now stand, facing the Tammany crew. The Tammany backers, dressed flush and fancy, face the scruffier, more savage Five Points bunch: the twin factions of the criminal underworld, so different in style and so similar in purpose, SIZE EACH OTHER UP from opposite sides of the room.
Bill STOPS. The odds are shifting, the stakes are climbing. Even the Chinese STOP GAMBLING. For the first time all evening the room is absolutely STILL. Even the Dead Rabbits have turned, at the door, to see what will happen.
Tweed and the Butcher LOCK EYES: neither blinks. Then after a moment ... a very long moment ...  a calm, bemused Tweed RAISES his glass.
BOSS TWEED
I only wanted to thank you, Bill, for the customary good job today... 
and an equally bright future for us both.
Another pause. Bill does not look placated. The whole place seems ready to explode... until Boss Tweed RISES to his feet, and RAISES his glass higher.
BOSS TWEED
Will you drink with me, Bill, as a friend? An honored friend.
Bill weighs the proposition...  then looks to his men, NODS his head to call them off. He GRABS a glass off a table to join Tweed's toast.
The MUSIC begins again. The gambling recommences. Patrons take their seats. The Dead Rabbits help Amsterdam out the door.
Monk Eastman sidles up to Bill the Butcher.
77
MONK EASTMAN
If there's one thing I can't abide, it's fighting for free.
He takes the Butcher's glass from his hand, raises it in salute, DRINKS DEEP and hands it back to him.
At the door of the Pagoda, a badly beaten Amsterdam starts FLAILING and fighting by brute instinct. He HITS Jenny, and she goes down. Johnny grapples with him as Jenny PICKS HERSELF up and struggles to help SUBDUE Amsterdam.
JENNY
Go easy! Go easy. It's over.
JOHNNY
He knew what he was doing, hitting you.
JENNY
Let's get him up.
She grabs Amsterdam's arm and, with Johnny's help, tries to HOIST him
back
to his feet.
JENNY
(Looking at Amsterdam's bloody face)
Therels too damn little of him left to know anything.
They start across Paradise Square, holding him up... 
...  as the rest of the Dead Rabbits join to help them...  all growing smaller in the distance against the primeval nighttime landscape of the Five Points... and the Bouncer CLOSES the door.
DISSOLVE TO
INT. DON WHISKERANDOS BARBER SHOP DAY
Another DOOR OPENS, and Amsterdam stands on the threshold. A week or so has passed since the big night at Sparrow's Pagoda, but Amsterdam's face still shows the marks of Bill's beating.
Don Whiskerandos is ministering to Monk Eastman with a straight razor, giving him a close and careful shave. Monk is thoroughly relaxed, doesn't even glance over when the door opens, hardly reacts when Don Whiskerandos says ... .
DON WHISKERANDOS
Someone's here for you.
MONK EASTMAN
That so? What's he look like?
78
DON WHISKERANDOS
He looks pretty damned sorry.
MONK EASTMAN
(looks at Amsterdam)
Indeed.- Can I buy you a shave?
AMSTERDAM
No thanks.
MONK EASTMAN
Face is too sore, eh? I understand.
AMSTERDAM
No. I'm beholden enough to you as it is. I don't like to be beholden.
MONK EASTMAN
We're all even, son. There's nothing more between us.
AMSTERDAM
I'd like it if there was.
MONK EASTMAN
Are you proposing employment?
AMSTERDAM
A collaboration. The Dead Rabbits got to get strong before we make
another
move. I figure you're the one to make us strong. There's a lot we can
learn from you.
MONK EASTMAN
Boyo, I'm a freebooter and a mercenary, not a teacher. I can't learn
nothing from you and I can't earn nothing from you either.
AMSTERDAM
The Dead Rabbits is going to be glorious again. We're going to reign
over
the Points.
MONK EASTMAN
And Bill Poole's Natives? What will they have to say?
AMSTERDAM
Nothing. They won't have tongues left to speak.
MONK EASTMAN
Don't worry about what theylll have in their mouths. You think about
what
they got in their hands.
(beat)
79
Listen, son...  take a word from a man who was honored to fight beside
your
father. Temper yourself like a sword, and pay attention to balance.
Anger
spoils an edge.
AMSTERDAM
Then you say no?
Monk SIGHS and points to a huge WAR CLUB which hangs in a place of honor above the shop mirror. It has deep marks running along its front, like NOTCHES-
MONK EASTMAN
You see my instrument there? First notch represents two dollars and
fifty
cents. That's how much I got for my first kill. There are forty-eight
more
notches after it, and my fee has grown with each one. I can
accommodate
you alright, but you got to afford me. So do business with me or do it
on
your own.
AMSTERDAM
Everything I got is still to come. So I guess it's on my own, then.
MONK EASTMAN
Fair enough. You'll find independence a fine thing, a fierce thing.
Although I do hold money preferable to all.
(Amsterdam turns to leave)
But I'm sure we'll have news of each other.
AMSTERDAM
Bound to.
As he shuts the door of the shop, Monk Eastman gestures to Don Whiskerandos for another hot towel.
CUT TO
EXT. STREETS OFF PARADISE SQUARE DAY
A large wagon bearing a Tammany banner and carrying dozens of small sacks of coal moves slowly down the narrow street. Boss Tweed sits on the front seat, next to the driver, as his minions HAND him coal sacks. Tweed distributes them with a smile to the NEEDY who trot next to the wagon.
80
BOSS TWEED
(to the people as they grab the coal)
Tammany's here to take the chill off the winter and the weight off your heart. It's Tammany can make this city a fit place, with the help and vote of all you good people... 
As he continues, Bill the Butcher JUMPS onto the wagon and sits down beside him. Boss Tweed hardly gives him a glance.
BILL THE BUTCHER
You sent me word.
BOSS TWEED
We could use help here. Grab a sack.
BILL THE BUTCHER
I keep my hands clean.
BOSS TWEED
(now he looks at him)
So I've observed.
BILL THE BUTCHER
(tense)
Better be on your mark to talk like that to me. It was you stopped me
at
the Pagoda. I would have cut Monk inside out.
BOSS TWEED
What if you hadn't? Think of the embarrassment. And what if you had? Consider the waste. Next time you're in a dust-up like that, think ahead
and make proper plans. It'd be a grand source of revenue, whoever prevails.
BILL THE BUTCHER
It touches my heart how you always. have our best interests in mind.
BOSS TWEED
Our mutual interests. That's why I want you to contact Monk Eastman.
(Bill's incredulous)
I want you to extend a proposition. I want him to join US.
BILL THE BUTCHER
What?
BOSS TWEED
Oh, not Tammany, of course not. We could no more have him there than
you.
But he should throw in with the Native Americans, become aware of our Arrangement and ...  well, use his influence, shall we say, to enrich us all.
81
BILL THE BUTCHER
You're saying I can't do everything you need? You don't think the
Natives
has been doing good and right? You think there's something more he can
do
that I ... 
BOSS TWEED
(interrupting)
It's none of that, Bill. None of that. His independence is like a
rebuke
to Tammany. And an insult to you.
BILL THE BUTCHER
Then you should have let me have him at Sparrow's.
BOSS TWEED
I should. If I'd been confident-absolutely certain--that you would
have
prevailed. Monk is an unpredictable power, and a figure of size. He
needs
to be reckoned with.
BILL THE BUTCHER
He needs to be killed.
BOSS TWEED
No. He's an elemental force. Them you don't destroy. But you can
contain
them and use them for the good they give off.
He hands Bill a sack of coal.
BOSS TWEED
Coal?
Bill doesn't answer. He HOPS DOWN off the moving wagon, and the Needy give way quickly before him, then regroup and SWARM after Tweed and his coal. The Boss continues with his Tammany spiel-enjoying all the attention—as the Butcher watches, disdainful of Tweed but filled with angry frustration. From his face we ... 
DISSOLVE TO
INT. DON WHISKERA.NDOS BARBER SHOP DAY
...  the incredulous face of Monk Eastman, as he looks at Bill the Butcher.
82
MONK EASTMAN
And this is your offer?
BILL THE BUTCHER
It's Boss Tweedls offer.
MONK EASTMAN
How do you think we'd sit as allies, Bill?
BILL THE BUTCHER
The only way we could tolerate being near each other would be
stretched
out dead.
MONK EASTMAN
My thoughts exactly. Then why are you here? Because you were asked to
be.
You were ordered to be. And who would order me among the Natives? You?
And
would you follow my orders, even if they was being relayed from
William Marcy Tweed himself?
He EASES himself out of the barber chair. The Butcher TENSES as Monk comes toward him.
MONK EASTMAN
Dubious and doubtful, my friend. But your offer--pardon, the offer you bring--is the most generous that's ever been extended. I favor the terms,
if not the personalities. So let us decide the way any Native American would appreciate. We'll do it the democratic way.
He throws open the door of the barber shop and stands there, beside Bill the Butcher, his arm thrown carelessly around him. PASSERSBY stop in wonderment as Monk ADDRESSES them.
MONK EASTMAN
Citizens of the Five Points! It seems the Native Americans have come to trouble. They have grown so weak that now they seek my help. They can pay any wage I ask. But I ask you now. Even for money, should I carouse and conspire alongside a boyo like this with gristle on his knife and spittle on his chin every time his cock gets hard?
Monk is beaming, the Butcher is appalled. His body tenses like a snake ready to spring. But the people in the street just STARE- They can't believe what they've just heard.
MONK EASTMAN
(to Bill)
There. You see. I'm afraid the people have spoken.
83
BILL THE BUTCHER
I'll see you again, you bog Irish bastard.
MONK EASTMAN
Well, if it's a fight you want now, Bill, remember to come back with a
bankroll.
Monk returns to the shop and the comfort of his chair. Bill GLARES at the people in the street. One lock from him starts them moving fast. But they do not look away from him quite so fast, or at him, either, with quite the same fear.
CUT TO
INT. MISSION (FORMERLY OLD BREWERY) NIGHT
The vast main room has been changed into a dance floor and decorated for the evening. An altar has been hung with bunting; SHIP'S LANTERNS and CANDLES illuminate the place. The REVEREND SHADRACH RALEIGH GREETS everyone. The room, already crowded with CELEBRANTS of all ages, grows quiet as the Dead Rabbits, done up in their party best, show up for the revelry.
REVEREND RALEIGH
Ah, the Native Americans, is it now?
AMSTERDAM
Are they coming?
JENNY
We don't want a ruckus, minister.
REVEREND RALEIGH
Nor do I. I intended no disrespect. I'd heard the Native Americans
were
figures of the greatest prominence here.
AMSTERDAM
Indeed they are, just for the moment. Let them come. Happy to have
them.
Everyone's welcome in a house of God, isn't that right, Reverend?
REVEREND RALEIGH
As all are welcome in heaven.
SHEENY MIKE
Ild like to go to heaven. Ild like to go to heaven and bite off
Gabriells
ear.
REVEREND RALEIGH
You're still welcome, even with such peculiar appetites.
84
AMSTERDAM
But if the Natives do come, Father... 
REVEREND RALEIGH
I'm not a priest, son ... 
AMSTERDAM
...  there's no accounting for what may follow.
REVEREND RALEIGH
I'm sure God's hand will guide us in that. Just as He guided you here
at
the right perfect time, with a right perfect regent. The young lady
with
the sunset hair. Miss ... 
JENNY
Everdeane. Jenny Everdeane.
REVEREND RALEIGH
Miss Everdeane. Step forward, please.
Radiant and curious, Jenny joins the Reverend Raleigh in the center of the room.
REVEREND RALEIGH
And the evening's regent chooses her evening's partner.
There is much MUTTERING about this from everyone. Someone makes a wet, farting SOUND.
REVERAND RALEIGH
(unfazed)
Here we make only joyful noises to the Lord.
Under the instruction of the bustling Reverend and his HELPERS, the Women skeptically stand away from the Men, who allow themselves to be arranged into a LINE. The Reverend Raleigh escorts the delighted Jenny to a chair that has been placed, by itself, in the center of the room. Jenny sits down, facing away from the rest of the guests. She holds a MIRROR in her hand.
REVEREND RALEIGH
Now. The men, please. One by one.
The first volunteer Reverend Raleigh brings forward is a reluctant Sheeny Mike. There are RUDE COMMENTS as he leads Mike slowly to the center of the room, coming up behind Jenny until she can see Mikels face reflected in the mirror. She SHAKES her head.
85
REVEREND RALEIGH
Next Gentleman, please.
More laughing. The BOYS push out one CANDIDATE. Rejected.
Now ANOTHER CANDIDATE comes forward. And STILL ANOTHER- Jenny rejects each with the composure of a princess.
Now it is Johnny's turn. He WALKS slowly across the big room, and stands behind Jenny, trying to look confident. The moment is long, the room's tense...  until--just once but very decisively-Jenny SHAKES her head.
Jenny watches Johnny's face in the mirror. She stays still. Finally, he walks back to the GANG.
Now Amsterdam starts toward the center of the room. He keeps his eyes fixed on Jenny.
Jenny catches Amsterdam's reflection in the mirror. He STOPS. She NODS her head. Yes. Him.
A small BAND strikes up a barely recognizable version of "A Mighty Fortress Is Our God," arranged in waltz time. Jenny rises and holds out her arms to Amsterdam. They start to DANCE, a little clumsily, as other COUPLES join them.
AMSTERDAM
So you accept?
JENNY
What?
AMSTERDAM
You accept to be my mort and no one else's.
JENNY
(teasing)
No, it's just that I didn't recognize you in the mirror. You still got
some of the face the Butcher gave you.
AMSTERDAM
(going along with the joke)
It's not the Butcher, it's the dancing. It shifts my face all around.
JENNY
Maybe you'll look better later.
The Reverend Raleigh and his Helpers DASH among the dancers, distributing LIGHTED CANDLES, which the COUPLES take and hold as they move around the floor.
86
AMSTERDAM
I will if we're together later.
(she smiles)
And what about after that? After tonight?
JENNY
I chose you just for tonight. If that's not good enough I'll go with
someone else.
She takes a candle from the Reverend and holds it so the light
FLICKERS on
Amsterdam's face.
AMSTERDAM
I'll have tonight. But after this don't come to me no more till you're
ready. No more.
His eyes, in the candlelight, show both his love and his Resolution. Jenny NODS and they DANCE AWAY ... losing themselves now among the dancers, all moving and holding candles. As they dance, their movement becomes SPLIT, SEQUENTIAL, a study in motion like an old Gjon Mili photograph. Their bodies create a RUSH OF YELLOW LIGHT ACROSS the screen like the tail of a comet.
CUT TO
INT- DEAD RABBITS HOUSE NIGHT
In the hallway. JOHNNY stands pressed against a door.
JOHNNY
(whispering)
Amsterdam.
(louder; hissing)
Amsterdam!
AMSTERDAM (V.O.)
Who is it?
JOHNNY
Me.
AMSTERDAM
Come on in.
JOHNNY
I don't want to come in! You come out.
AMSTERDAM
Just a damn minute.
87
AMSTERDAM comes to the door, half-dressed and sleepy. We see Jenny asleep on the floor inside.
AMSTERDAM
What do you want?
CUT TO
EXT. PIER/DEAD RABBITS HOUSE NIGHT
Just before dawn. The streets are empty, the river is quiet. AMSTERDAM follows JOHNNY out of the house.
JOHNNY
I'm going to fight you.
AMSTERDAM
Oh, Jesus, Johnny, I'm tired. How about sometime else?
JOHNNY
Now.
AMSTERDAM
You want to tell me what this fight's over? Is it The Butcher? Jenny?
(Johnny turns, determined)
Alright, alright. Then tell me why like this?
JOHNNY
So when I lose no one will see.
And he SLUGS him. Hard. Harder even than he thought he could. AMSTERDAM stumbles, stunned, then pulls himself up. And CHARGES at Johnny, knocking him down.
The two friends PUNCH, WRESTLE, BITE and PUMMEL EACH OTHER with such extravagant energy that they soon... 
...  ROLL OFF the pier... 
CUT TO
EXT. PIER DAWN
...  onto the muddy ground underneath the pier. They LAND with a shuddering SPLASH in the soggy earth, but they keep fighting ... as a PACK OF ORPHANS, eyes glinting like night animals, scatter like wild beasts disturbed in their burrow.
Amsterdam has the physical advantage, and more skill. But Johnny has the fury. All the feeling and the frustration rain out of him physically, making the match nearly even.
88
The Orphan Pack watches the fight silently, showing no favoritism or emotion, just an edge of curiosity.
Amsterdam HITS Johnny a wicked combination that makes him SINK to one knee in the mud. But Johnny will not go down. Amsterdam, hurt himself, just stares at Johnny in wonderment.
AMSTERDAM
Satisfied?
JOHNNY
Satisfied? It wasn't me that's been dancing and shagging all night.
And he pulls himself to his feet and THROWS a roundhouse at Amsterdam, who half-staggers out of the way. The moment throws Johnny off balance, and he falls in the mud again, this time on all fours. Amsterdam SINKS down beside him.
AMSTERDAM
Enough.
Johnny won't stop: he throws a punch that Amsterdam can see coming a block away. But he's too tired too duck; or maybe he's just fed up. He takes the punch and FALLS on his back.
AMSTERDAM
That's it then.
JOHNNY
The hell.
And he THROWS HIMSELF on Amsterdam. It's more like he rolls over onto him than anything, but he's on top of him now, hitting him in the face with all he's got left in him.
AMSTERDAM
Goddamn it.
Amsterdam HEAVES Johnny off and pops him a solid SWIPE to the jaw. That does it. Lights out. Johnny falls unconscious into the slime beneath the pier.
The Orphan Pack keeps staring from the shadow with their ferret eyes. Still silent. Amsterdam STRUGGLES to his feet, stops at the river's edge to get a handful of water to revive himself. Then he looks over, sees his unconscious friend.
AMSTERDAM
Goddamn you anyway.
He grabs Johnny's body by the shoulders and pulls him to the river's edge.
89
He gets some water on his hand, lets it drip over Johnny's face, washing away a little of the blood. Not enough. He draws some more water, and RUBS it gently onto Johnny's face.
CLOSE: on the motion of his hand. It is nearly gentle.
CUT TO
INT. DON WHISKERANDOS BARBER SHOP DAY
As Don Whiskerandos' hand, holding a razor, travels over the great plains of Monk Eastman's face. His hand is shaking.
MONK EASTMAN
What's the trouble, Don?
DON WHISKERANDOS
There's someone here.
Monk bestirs himself in the chair, SEES: Bill the Butcher, standing in the doorway.
MONK EASTMAN
It's just a man of commerce.
Monk settles back in the chair as Bill the Butcher walks into the shop.
BILL THE BUTCHER
You're right enough this time, Monk.
(to Don Whiskerandos)
Go ahead.
(the barber hesitates)
Go on with your work. I'll finish my business.
Don Whiskerandos picks up a pair of SCISSORS and NERVOUSLY starts to TRIM Monk's hair.
MONK EASTMAN
Come out with it then.
Bill NODS emphatically at Don Whiskerandos, who is clearly terrified. Bill nods again, almost vehemently. Don Whiskerandos SHAKES his head. Bill GLARES at him. The Barber takes a STEP BACK. Monk opens his eyes, starts to size up the situation.
BILL THE BUTCHER
You damn craven, do it!
Bill LEAPS forward, grabs the trembling barber's arm and pushes it toward MONK... 
90
MONK EASTMAN
(rising from his chair)
What the hell... 
... and the scissors, held by Don Whiskerandos and pushed by Bill the Butcher, meet Monk full in the face as he bolts from the chair. The long scissor BLADE SINKS into Monkls right eye.
MONK BELLOWS, staggers toward Don Whiskerandos, who shrinks against the wall. The scissor protrudes from Monk's eye as he RAGES, blinded by blood, now reaching out for the Butcher
BILL THE BUTCHER
Your eyes was open for that alright. And you still got one to see
this.
Bill the Butcher reaches above him for Monk's war club, which hangs on the wall. He grabs tight hold of it and, with Monk nearly upon him, swings it viciously at Monk's head. The BLOW sends the scissor FLYING out of Monk's eye, with the eyeball still attached. It also SMASHES in the side of Monk's face. He FALLS, still GRABBING desperately for the Butcher... 
...  who now stands over him, beating him incessantly with the war club. CAVING his head in. KILLING him.
Don Whiskerandos looks at Bill in a virtual paralysis of terror. The Butcher lets the CLUB FALL, reaches in his pocket and throws some MONEY at the barber.
BILL THE BUTCHER
If I was you I'd use that to open in a new location. Consider St.
Louis.
The enormity of what he's done is beginning to sink in. He turns to leave the shop ...  but STOPS in the doorway.
Outside, CITIZENS of the Points are staring at the fallen Monk in mute wonder. They have just witnessed a moment in history.
Bill the Butcher surveys them all silently, then calls out to Don Whiskerandos.
BILL THE BUTCHER
The war club.
The barber steels himself to CARRY the bloody club to the Butcher, who hefts it slowly in his hands, in view of all.
He takes a knife from his vest, and CUTS the LAST NOTCH in the club.
Then, slowly... he steps down into the crowd, which PARTS before him.
91
He walks among them in regal splendor, the war club at his side, dripping gore.
As the crowd falls back, Bill spots Amsterdam, Johnny and some of the other Dead Rabbits, watching his every mave. He STOPS.
HOLDS OUT the bloody war club in front of him...  straight in front of him...  POINTING IT right at Amsterdam.
BILL THE BUTCHER
I promise you, Amsterdam. I promise you.
Then he grins, turns away and walks through the crowd: prince of all he surveys.
CUT TO
INT. RESTAURANT/PARK ROW
Boss Tweed reigns in the banquet room of a vast, gaslit restaurant, at a long table overburdened with food. Seated along both sides of the table is an array of the city's POWER BROKERS, with whom Tweed and his Tammany MINIONS mix easily. Their attitude toward the Power Brokers is a mixture of ribald fawning and fine condescension; the Power Brokers, in turn, enjoy the food, and the MUSIC from a small BAND, and the DANCING GIRLS who flirt and entertain them, while exuding the unmistakable impression of amateur anthropologists exploring a decaying civilization.
Tweed is courting and joking with a bewhiskered HORACE GREELEY, editor of the influential Tribune.
GREELEY
I may enjoy the bounty of your table and the pleasures of your
company,
Mr. Tweed ... 
BOSS TWEED
And the pleasures of the company provided you, Mr. Greeley.
GREELEY
... without the Tribune endorsing your politics.
BOSS TWEED
I suppose you can at that. Take with one hand, flay with the other.
Virtuels on your conscience, Horace, but Tammany's in your heart.
Killoran materializes at Tweed's side and whispers something quickly, discreetly in his ear. Tweed EXCUSES himself, rises quickly and WALKS across the restaurant floor... 
...  past the Band and the Dancing Giris ... 
92
...  to the swinging doors of the kitchen. As he pushes open the SWINGING DOOR, his face has lost its humor.
CUT TO
INT. KITCHEN/RESTAURANT/PARK ROW
A madhouse of activity. WAITERS in black suits, vests and serving outfits STREAM by carrying huge TRAYS of food while the KITCHEN STAFF works double-time to keep up with the unceasing volume.
As Boss Tweed walks in, Bill the Butcher PLUCKS a piece of roasted poultry off a tray as it's carried out the door.
BILL THE BUTCHER
I'm not good enough for your table, so I eat where I can. (takes a big
bite)
It's good, what is it?
BOSS TWEED
Pheasant.
BILL THE BUTCHER
Is that like pigeon? I killed a pigeon once but it didn't taste
nothing
like this.
BOSS TWEED
You killed a bull this morning. I told you to make an Arrangement with
him, and you come back with his blood on your hands.
BILL THE BUTCHER
(chewing his food)
He insulted me. He aggravated me. I couldn't stand for that, for no
one.
BOSS TWEED
You stand for anything if I tell you.
BILL THE BUTCHER
You think I should be afraid of you. You act like lightning strikes
when
you talk.
As they talk, and the tension builds between them, the two men are constantly BUFFETED by the swinging doors and the unending stream of WAITERS.
BILL THE BUTCHER
I never was afraid of you, so don't think I was or act like I was, you
ain't earned it.
93
BOSS TWEED
What did you earn us, killing Monk?
BILL THE BUTCHER
Where'd you earn the right to ask that question? You raised some dust
in
the streets a while back, but no more. You got power but you ain't got
muscle and you ain't got a notion what it means to be a warrior.
BOSS TWEED
I see it lost you a lot of God's sense, along with that eye.
BILL THE BUTCHER
You don't know nothing about that! It was my doing! It says in The
Book,
"If thy eye offend thee, pluck it out." I followed that law with my
own
knife and hand. The first I ever fought Priest Vallon, he bested me.
And
when he came to bring me to death, I looked away and he watched me and
he
let me go. The shame was worse than the killing. I would have cut out
both
eyes if I could still have fought, but cutting just the one gave me
heart.
When I killed Priest Vallon, that restored me. Now I sent Monk Eastman over I got glory. I got all there is, and small thanks to you, squire.
BOSS TWEED
(measured, conciliatory) You need two eyes to see the depth, Bill.
That's
how we help each other. If it wasn't for me would be happy enough to plunder the Points and put the fear into people who don't know nothing else. But Bill, I'm only saying...  I'm counselinm...  look in the distance.
You want to sit at my table, fine. But you must always remember who
the
host is. It's not a matter of courage welre talking. It's manners.
Bill grabs another piece of food from a tray.
BILL THE BUTCHER
Howls these manners?
BOSS TWEED
Fine, if you're hungry.
BILL THE BUTCHER
I'm always hungry.
94
BOSS TWEED
I've always told you, Bill. There's plenty for all, and more for us
together than separate. We'll dine together sometime.
Bill the Butcher nods, appeased, and leaves, swaggering his way through the kitchen chaos, making everyone get out of his way. Boss Tweed watches him go, his expression changing from bemused appeasement to molten rage
