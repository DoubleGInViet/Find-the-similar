INT. RESTAURANT/PARK ROW
Later. Everyone's gone except some WAITERS, cleaning up, and Boss Tweed and Daniel Killoran, who sit at the end of the banquet table. Leftover plates of food have been massed at Tweedls place and, as he talks, he PICKS from them.
BOSS TWEED
Let me put this to you, Daniel. Now that the Butcher has killed the
single
most prominent figure in the Five Points--a man of myth and moment--
who is
there to take his place?
(as Killoran starts to answer)
Of course. Then what do we do about the Butcher? He's too useful to be
killed, but he must be checked.
KILLARAN
It could be a police matter.
BOSS TWEED
Impossible! Any cops who might have the mettle to go against the
Butcher
have blood ties to the gangs. They can't be trusted. And any cops that
can
be trusted are too craven to be any use. If Bill's to be checked, it
must
come from within the Points, not without.
KILLORAN
The Dead Rabbits did a proud job for elections. That Amsterdam boy has
sand.
BOSS TWEED
That so? The last time I saw him he was under the Butcher's knife
looking
like a fine filet. Who else is there?
KILLORAN
Well, the Rough and Tumble Boys over to Slaughterhouse Point. There's Country McCleesterls bunch, too, and the Plug Uglies, but there's none
95
that have the promise of the Dead Rabbits, or the stake, neither.
BOSS TWEED
What would that be?
KILLORAN
The boy Amsterdam has a blood feud with the Butcher. He's sworn
revenge
for the death of his father, and he's got the heart to carry it
forward.
He'll have the skill and power soon enough.
BOSS TWEED
Blood will make a man intrepid. Bring them along, then. Nurture the
Rabbits with neglect. Let them roam where they like.
KILLORAN
And if they roam into some portion of our own revenues?
BOSS TWEED
I'd tolerate a little trespassing if it was for a higher good and use.
They'll cross with the Natives soon enough and keep each other
occupied.
KILLORAN
Bill's got to be a lot more than occupied.
BOSS TWEED
I'll hold Bill in check. If he becomes unwieldy ...  well, damn it all, Daniel, I might just have to oil up my old musket. What do you think of
that, eh?
Boss Tweed gets up from the table. A WAITER is DIMMING the gaslights, filling the room with deep shadows.
KILLORAN
It'd be gratifying, Mr. Tweed. Even edifying.
BOSS TWEED
But poor politics, eh? Well, we musn't have that.
(as he walks away)
I do miss those roistering days, though. Oh, and bring some of that
food
for the canaries.
96
CUT TO
EXT. STREET/THE BLOODY ANGLE DAY
The sharply-angled turn of Doyers Street, nicknamed "The Bloody Angle." SOUND of a horse and cart as we see a row of UPTURNED mostly WOMEN and YOUNG CHILDREN.
A NATIVE AMERICAN drives a cart carrying large barrels of MILK. A SECOND NATIVE rides beside him on the seat, holding a rifle, looking impassively at the faces turned up to him. A WOMAN holding a BABY in one arm and a CHILD by the hand steps in front of them. They almost run her down.
WOMAN
We ain't had no milk this week.
NATIVE 2
You can have as much as you can pay for.
(to crowd)
Anyone that's got the ned, step up with your pitchers. Any not, come
back
when you do.
The Woman gives her children to other WOMEN in the crowd and advances toward the wagon. Native 2 cocks his rifle... 
...  and Jenny steps from the watchful Crowd.
JENNY
I got ned enough for all. See? Fair enough?
She holds her hand out as she WALKS slowly toward the milk wagon. She's carrying a huge fistful of GLEAMING COINS. The Natives on the wagon watch her warily... 
...  and are JUMPED from behind by a couple of Dead Rabbits. Amsterdam grabs a milk pitcher from a WOMAN in the crowd, AXES open the spigot on a milk barrel and FILLS the pitcher to overflowing. Jenny JUMPS up on the wagon seat.
JENNY
(to Amsterdam)
What's our rate? What do we charge?
AMSTERDAM
Johnny worked it out to a nickel less than the Natives. Just till
we're
established. Then we raise it a penny more than now.
JENNY
Raise it? Is that what you want?
97
AMSTERDAM
You say, then.
JENNY
(beat; then, to Crowd) There'll be no paying at all this day. Or this
week, neither. This is Dead Rabbits business from now on.
The Crowd scrambles for milk and the Rabbits try to keep ORDER.
JENNY
(to Crowd)
We'll take ned if you got it, now or in future. But no one will go
without.
AMSTERDAM
(to Jenny)
Except us. You opening a charity?
JENNY
They'll pay us what they owe, in loyalty if not in cash. Tammany gives
coal, we give milk.
AMSTERDAM
They can afford it.
JENNY
Can't we?
CUT TO
INT. MOTHER JOYCE'S BORDELLO DAY
The midday sun shining through the windows makes the place look tatty and slightly desperate: this is a place that needs low light and long shadows to look good.
Amsterdam and Johnny are at a long bar, talking to Mother Joyce, a beefy, wised-up woman with pornographic tattoos an both forearms.
MOTHER JOYCE
This place is so clean it's the next thing to chaste. And safe as a
convent, too.
AMSTERDAM
From the Natives, maybe. But not from us.
MOTHER JOYCE
You're saying I got to worry about your mob too?
98
JOHNNY
No worries at all. You throw in with the Dead Rabbits and we'll worry
about the Natives.
Across the room, Jenny is sitting talking to a few of the WHORES, one of whom is a mixed-blood Eurasian with long black hair named Emma Loss. She gets up lazily and heads for the bar. As she passes a DRUNK, he reaches out to grab her. She's used to this, and she knocks his hand away. He keeps after her.
At the bar, Mother Joyce notices Emma being hassled, but pays no attention: her girls can take care of themselves.
MOTHER JOYCE
(to Amsterdam and Johnny)
And if someone else comes along, do I pay them too?
AMSTERDAM
You only pay us. We see you safe from everyone.
Johnny has been watching the drunk bothering Emma Loss. Without saying anything to Amsterdam or Mother Joyce, Johnny LEAVES the bar, walks over
to the drunk and SHOVES him away.
JOHNNY
Leave off her. She don't want you. Not even if you could pay her.
EMMA LOSS
Hey, just a minute.
JOHNNY
(to Emma)
He can't pay. I can pay.
AMSTERDAM
(watching this)
Maybe I should offer Johnny as a bouncer for your busy nights.
MOTHER JOYCE
(laughs)
A bouncer! I don't know if he could bounce on a feather bed. He wants
to
be a character like you, is that it?
AMSTERDAM
He's got his own ideas. Too full of Tammany, maybe, but he's a fast
friend.
Across the room, Johnny is talking to Emma Loss. She NODS and starts to LEAD him upstairs.
99
MOTHER JOYCE
But in my trade you go on your instincts. My instincts says to heed
you,
and my memory of your father says I'm right. We'll shake on it.
(Amsterdam grabs her hand)
And have one of my best to seal the bargain. Megs!
A lanky blonde, seated across the room near Jenny, bestirs herself.
MOTHER JOYCE
Come here and show my new friend why we're worth special care.
Jenny watches MEGS move toward Amsterdam.
CUT TO
INT. ASSIGNATION ROOM/MOTHER JOYCE'S
Big enough to contain a half-gutted mattress supported by a rickety bed, some worn sheets and a few GUTTERING CANDLES.
Johnny undresses as Emma sits on the bed and starts to take off her dress.
JOHNNY
You liked that old man? You would have gone with him?
EMMA LOSS
I like anyone that pays, that's all.
JOHNNY
Tell me what he wanted you to do.
EMMA LOSS
He mostly wanted comforting.
JOHNNY
I never seen hair so black. Can you take the pins out?
EMMA LOSS
It takes so long to do back up.
He sits beside her and starts slowly, almost tenderly, to remove the pins.
JOHNNY
Did your mother have the same color?
I don't know.
JOHNNY
(as the hair cascades over her bare shoulders)
100
Lie back, I want to look at you.
(his eyes glide along her body)
What's that mark?
EMMA LOSS
I always had it.
JOHNNY
(touching her lightly)
And there? Is that a scar?
EMMA LOSS
(she looks at her naked belly)
There was a baby. They cut it out.
JOHNNY
And that on your shoulder? That looks old.
EMMA LOSS
Yeah, I got that when I ... 
JOHNNY
(interrupting, quiet)
I don't want to know when. Don't tell me about before or what you used
to
be, I don't want that.
EMMA LOSS
What about your scars. Do you have scars?
JOHNNY
None I ever seen. Maybe you can find them.
Her hands and mouth cover his body. He closes his eyes.
CUT TO
INT. ASSIGNATION ROOM/MOTHER JOYCEIS
Another room. Amsterdam and Megs are undressing each other when Jenny walks in.
AMSTERDAM
Go on. I can see you later.
Megs leaves, brushing past Jenny.
JENNY
What are you doing?
AMSTERDAM
I couldn't decline what Mother Joyce offered. It's in the interests of
business. You understand business.
101
JENNY
Sure I do. But there's something else I still don't understand. At
Sparrow's Pagoda, did you hit me, knowing it was me?
AMSTERDAM
Yeah. I did.
She HITS him. In the face. Hard. Not a slap. A solid PUNCH. His nose starts to gush blood. He puts his arm under it to staunch the flow, keeping his eyes an her.
JENNY
Meantime's over.
AMSTERDAM
Oh fine. That's fine. I'd be celebrating but I'm losing too much
blood.
Jenny tears part of the sleeve from her blouse and puts it against his nose.
JENNY
Put your head back.
AMSTERDAM
That don't work.
JENNY
Put your head back I said.
AMSTERDAM
(as she tends to him)
So why so sudden, then?
JENNY
Sudden? Every day I see you and you complain I can't decide. Now I
decide,
you say it's sudden.
AMSTERDAM
It's the whore did it, then.
JENNY
Don't flatter yourself.
AMSTERDAM
It's because you're jealous.
JENNY
It's because you didn't lie about hitting me.
102
AMSTERDAM
Christ, I wish I had. Come here, then.
He reaches to pull her down on the bed.
JENNY
Not here. There's too much past.
CUT TO
INT. ROOM/DEAD RABBIT HOUSE
The room where Johnny fetched Amsterdam out for the fight. Amsterdam and Jenny have just made love.
JENNY
It must be morning.
AMSTERDAM
I don't care, I'm not getting up.
JENNY
This is what you meant, then? It's going to be just the same from now
on?
AMSTERDAM
What?
JENNY
Every morning I wake up next to you.
AMSTERDAM
Or you don't wake up at all.
JENNY
We only just started in and you're already threatening me.
AMSTERDAM
It's not a threat.
(no teasing now)
It's a declaration of love.
JENNY
I prefer my kind. This kind.
She reaches beneath the pillow and pulls out a fine DIAMOND RING, which she slips on his finger. Amsterdam reacts with surprise, gratitude and (of course) suspicion.
AMSTERDAM
What's this? Where'd you get this?
103
JENNY
You said I was the best thief in the Five Points. But I got
restless. Will you wear something I got?
CUT TO
EXT- UPTOWN STREET DAY
A long street of tree-shaded houses. Spacious lawns. North of the Five Points. Considerably north. This is the first time we have been outside the Five Points and Paradise Square. The city rent place.
Jenny and Amsterdam stand near a residence at the end of the street. Amsterdam, dressed in a suit, can't quite conceal his wonder as he stands staring at the house.
AMSTERDAM
What is this place?
JENNY
My jeweler's.
She GESTURES for him to follow her and we see now that she is dressed in a maid's outfit.
JENNY
Come on.
AMSTERDAM
I don't see nobody.
JENNY
That's the best time. They're all having lunch.
CUT TO
EXT. UPTOWN HOUSE DAY
At the back door of the grand house, as Jenny OPENS it slowly and glances inside.
AMSTERDAM
You're off your head.
JENNY
(pleased, showing off)
You can wait on me a minute. Or I'll see you back in the Points if
you're
scared.
(Amsterdam looks at her)
Don't worry. I know every house on this street. They all leave their
doors
104
open. They live like they're not in New York.
She GOES IN the house. Amsterdam WATCHES through the window, sees her going up stairs. Then he looks at the dining room, visible distantly through an open kitchen door.
He WATCHES, fascinated, fragments of the everyday rituals of a world he's never seen. As SOUNDS drift listlessly from the street beyond, and a light BREEZE blows, WE SEE IN A SERIES OF DISSOLVES the serving of a meal; SERVANTS carrying and passing plates; FAMILY MEMBERS reaching for dishes and passing them; the LOW KURMUR of Konversation in accents he has never heard. It's not so much that these people and their life are foreign to him. It is as if he has stepped into another Dimension.
He loses his sense of time, and of danger. So that when Jenny TOUCHES his arm she surprises him thoroughly.
JENNY
Come on. I might still be taken for a maid. But you're nobody's notion
of a butler.
EXT. UPTOWN STREET DAY
As Jenny and Amsterdam walk away from the house. She holds his arm. They look young and full of hope, like a servant couple just over from the old country enjoying a day off.
JENNY
The Police Commissioner lives the next street over. I was thinking of visiting him next month, but cops don't buy goods. They keep all their graft in cash.
Amsterdam looks at the houses with wonder that he tries to make casual. She opens her satchel a little way, then NUDGES him to have a lock at the swag inside.
JENNY
How's that for ten minutes?
AMSTERDAM
It's a lot to fence.
JENNY
I'm not going to fence it. I'm going to keep it and take it where no
one
will recognize it.
AMSTERDAM
Where would that be?
105
JENNY
Somewhere west. Far west. Past the Mississippi River, somewhere into
that
territory.
AMSTERDAM
That's a hard journey for a woman alone.
JENNY
You'd be with me.
AMSTERDAM
You got it all planned and straight, is that it?
JENNY
Once I said I'd be with you I wanted someplace we could be together.
Someplace better than here. What's the matter with that?
AMSTERDAM
Nothing. Except there's no place but here for me right now. I got to
settle things.
JENNY
Yeah, I know, but I'm talking about settling down, not settling debts.
AMSTERDAM
You don't have my obligations.
CUT TO
EXT. PARADISE SQUARE DAY
The Dead Rabbits SWEEP across the bustling square, Johnny and Amsterdam in the lead.
JOHNNY
It's a fair day's wage. We just move the people out of the building,
and
collect.
AMSTERDAM
Who from?
JOHNNY
Who owns the building.
(points)
Them.
The gang approaches a tumbledown BUILDING called Jacob's Ladder because of the iron rungs that run straight up its front to the roof. Two well-dressed GENTS stare at the building fretfully.
106
GENT 1
(to Johnny)
I'm glad you came in force. There's half a hundred people still in
there.
GENT 2
Maybe more.
GENT 1
And not one's given rent the whole year.
AMSTERDAM
You live here?
GENT 1
No, no, of course not.
AMSTERDAM
I mean in the city. A ways north, I'll bet.
GENT 2
Yes. Why?
A RIFLE SHOT sounds from an upper window and a Rabbit falls wounded.
They all DUCK FOR COVER.
JOHNNY
It's not just citizens in there?
GENT 1
Of course it is.
JOHNNY
with arms?
GENT 2
From their damned gang. Some of them live there.
AMSTERDAM
Some of who?
GENT 2
The Native Americans.
JOHNNY
We didn't contract for that.
GENT 1
We'll pay extra for the danger.
AMSTERDAM
No danger. But you will pay extra.
107
(turns; to gang)
Let's go and greet some Natives.
Under SCATTERED RIFLE FIRE and a barrage of ROCKS, the GANG STORMS the building, charging inside and starting up the ladder as if they were attacking a medieval fortress. ARMS reach out from windows to try and pull them off. The Rabbits respond with knives and PISTOL SHOTS. As they charge inside, the CAMERA RISES to an OVERHEAD shot and we ... 
DISSOLVE TO
EXT. PARADISE SQUARE DAY
Later. The same OVERHEAD ANGLE. BODIES litter the street everywhere. Some dead and wounded Rabbits lie near NATIVES who have gone to their reward. Some BUILDING RESIDENTS wander the street in a daze. JOHNNY is collecting money from the Two Gents, who look very pleased as Amsterdam approaches with Jenny. He's carrying a rifle he took from the building.
AMSTERDAM
(to Gents)
Alright, then?
GENT 2
Very much alright. Quite a spectacle.
AMSTERDAM
Oh really? Just the entertainment you favor, is it? Pardon me for a
moment, gents.
(he turns to Jenny)
You wanted to settle, you and me. That's so, isn't it? You did agree,
did
you not.
JENNY
I did, yes.
AMSTERDAM
Good, because I didn't want to act hasty. I can never tell for sure
what
you're thinking, and sometimes I'm not always sure what you're
saying... 
GENT 2
(interrupting)
Excuse me, we have to finish and... 
AMSTERDAM
(to Gent 2)
Excuse me. We'll conclude in a moment.
108
(back to Jenny)
Where do you settle?
JENNY
Amsterdam, what are you saying?
AMSTERDAM
I'm asking, where does anyone settle?
JENNY
I don't know, you mean a place, a home?
AMSTERDAM
A home yes.
GENT 1
Excuse me, but we really must conclude.
AMSTERDAM
(ignoring him)
Well, I'm saying to you then, Jenny Everdeane, welcome home.
No one sees it coming. Amsterdam FLASHES around, swinging the BUTT of his
rifle into Gent l's midsection, doubling him over and sending him breathless to the ground. Amsterdam SPINS again and swings the butt into
Gent 2's face, knocking him cold.
AMSTERDAM
Fine place. Room enough for all.
(to Johnny)
Get them out of here.
GENT 2
They'll come back looking for you.
AMSTERDAM
With whose help? The Natives? They won't help these flourishing
bastards
even for ned.
(to Jenny)
Tell any who wants they can stay. If they can't pay rent they can join
the
gang. But make sure the best rooms go to us. Look around ... 
JENNY
(interrupting)
I know this building.
109
CUT TO
INT. UNDERGROUND/JACOB'S LADDER
As Jenny leads Amsterdam through a narrow tunnel. The place is like a weird catacomb: it is narrow and dank, filled with bones of dead animals, of the two- and four-legged variety.
JENNY
These lead all under the Square, into the Brewery and out again from there. They're closed off and forgotten since the Reverend opened the mission. Pass me the candle.
Amsterdam hands Jenny a stump of candle, which she holds high enough to see... that the tunnel has opened onto a small room just above the foundation of Jacob's Ladder. It's a graveyard, memorializing gang members gone to a better world--or worse. Trophies from many gangs-- including the bones and skulls of some Dead Rabbits-litter the place in loose ritual fashion, as if this were a catacomb in Palermo.
Stooping low, Jenny walks to a narrow corner of the room, where several PAVING STONES have been laid in the rough pattern of a cross. A slab of slate serves as a headstone, and on it, in fading paint, barely legible, is the name "Maggie Everdeane."
JENNY
We lived in this building till she lost her seamstress work and we
went to
the Brewery. One day she slept so drunk she never woke and I brought
her
back here. Dug this myself.
(beat)
Families. Give here what I gave you.
Amsterdam hands her a chest that looks like a small version of Blackbeard's treasure box. She opens it and holds the candle close: inside is the swag from all her cat burglaries. There's a lot of it, GLITTERING with promise in the GUTTERING flame. Jenny starts to dig in her mother's grave.
JENNY
She'll keep an eye on this for us. How about some help?
He KNEELS beside her and they dig at the grave with stones and bones.
AMSTERDAM
You trusting me with your treasure, then?
JENNY
Just take another look at it to remind you. I can always do fine on my
own.
110
Amsterdam reaches inside the chest, pulls out a ring and SLIPS it onto Jenny's dirt-covered finger. She KISSES him.
JENNY
What's mine is yours, is that it?
AMSTERDAM
I could use this, too.
From the bag he holds up a small GOLD CROSS.
JENNY
You making an offering to the Reverend Raleigh?
Amsterdam slips the cross into his pocket without answering and starts to dig again.
AMSTERDAM
Are you sure we can trust your mother?
CUT TO
INT. HALLWAY/TAMMANY
BOSS TWEED listens to an angry BILL THE BUTCHER as they walk briskly down a long marble corridor lined with formal portraits of former Tammany worthies.
BOSS TWEED
The building and how many?
BILL THE BUTCHER
A dozen at least of my Natives.
BOSS TWEED
The Dead Rabbits are a wooly bunch alright.
BILL THE BUTCHER
I want at them. All of them, and Amsterdam especial. Now.
BOSS TWEED
Not just now. It's between too late and too soon. They've become a
little
too prominent for comfort, but they're still too small for you to soil your hands. The man who killed Monk Eastman pushing around a mob of upstarts. It's practically undignified.
BILL THE BUTCHER
To hell with any of that.
Tweed stops under a grand new PORTRAIT of himself.
111
BOSS TWEED
Very well, and to hell as well with any plans you and I may have for
growth and change and even greater reward. You'll never advance
anywhere
beyond the limited perimeter of your imagination.
BILL THE BUTCHER
I don't got to advance anywhere further.
BOSS TWEED
Got to, no. But ought to.
He hands him a fancy embossed envelope.
BILL THE BUTCHER
What's this?
BOSS TWEED
(eyes merry)
An invitation. To dinner.
CUT TO
INT. JENNY AND AMSTERDAM'S ROOM/JACOB'S LADDER DAY
Better by a little than their place in the old hideout. There's even a window that throws some LIGHT an the few bits of castoff furniture in the room...  an the bed where Jenny sleeps with her face turned to the dawn light...  and an Amsterdam, who is dressing quietly in the corner. He checks in his coat Pocket,... finds the gold cross ...  and leaves.
Jenny
does nat stir.
CUT TO
EXT. GRAVEYARD DAY
START CLOSE on: Amsterdam's hand, as he places the gold cross in a small hole at a grave site, then covers it over with dirt.
Then WE SEE: Amsterdam is kneeling at his father's grave.
AMSTERDAM
He never had his own cross. Thanks.
Now he STANDS and TURNS. Jenny is half-hidden behind an elm tree.
AMSTERDAM
Your touch is light, but as a tracker you work awful heavy. Come
ahead.
112
Now that I met your mother, you should come and meet my father.
As Jenny starts to WALK towards the grave, we see for the first time ... that we are in the country, a graveyard in an open field with an astonishing PANORAMA of New York and the East River. (MATTE) The cemetery is atop a hill, and the East River, busy with ferries and vessels of trade, glistens in the near distance. Just beyond it is Manhattan Island: low buildings, winding narrow streets, houses surrounded by open land. A BREEZE off the river rustles Jenny's dress and blows her hair as she steps up to the grave site, looks at the headstone and sees ...  it is blank. No name, no date. Clean stane.
JENNY
You should finish the stone.
AMSTERDAM
It'll be finished when everything's finished. That's when helll rest.
The
hand that killed him is the hand that will bury him in peace.
He holds up his open hand, covered in dirt.
JENNY
It was Bill killed him, not you.
AMSTERDAM
With my hand on the knife.
JENNY
And his hand on yours!
AMSTERDAM
And me feeling the life go out of my father! He looked at me ...  he
looked
at me and he swore me with his eyes. I could feel his spirit...  I say
I
could feel it rising...  flowing through the knife like blood into my
own
heart.
JENNY
You talk like he lives in you.
AMSTERDAM
I don't want him to live, I want him dead! I kill Bill and I'm free of
them both!
JENNY
You think you can be free that easy? You need your way so clear, and you''' use anything to clear it. Anyone, too. Me, everybody, we're all just a way for you to settle your damned ghosts.
113
AMSTERDAM
You're part of me now, like the gang is part of me and my father both.
If
I can bring us to glory, then my father...  like The Book says... my
father
can enter his house justified.
As Amsterdam continues to talk we ... 
DISSOLVE TO
MONTAGE
The growth of the Dead Rabbits, as we continue to HEAR Amsterdam speak passionately to Jenny. We first see the Rabbits surrounding and OVERTURNING a fire wagon; this starts as a live action scene but soon BLEEDS into SEPIA, then freezes like an old magazine illustration.
AMSTERDAM (V.O.)
All of us is set on the same road together. The gang can have
everything
they ever wanted and get me what I want while they're doing it. We're
not
interfering with each other, we're helping each other. It's all the
same,
we're all one together.
We CONTINUE with sepia illustrations: of Dead Rabbit morts picking pockets and purses along a crowded Broadway; climbing onto a wagon distributing newspapers and tossing off the occupants, taking over the route themselves; swarming all over a merchant ship in the harbor as the captain doles out protection money to have his cargo unloaded.
AMSTERDAM (V.O.)
We'll all have a share of the profit like we'll all have a portion of
the
fame. If we come to be notorious, that only means we're strong, and if
we're strong that means we're ready.
A sepia illustration of a fire wagon rounding a corner, refurbished and manned by Rabbits, all wearing striking uniforms with short capes called TAMLAS. (N.B.: they will be seen wearing the tanlas from these uniforms during all gang activity throuqhout the rest of the film. Only Johnny, Amsterdam and Jenny do not wear them.)
The sepia illustration turns to live action as the fire wagon TEARS around Paradise Square, SCATTERING everyone in its path, the Dead Rabbits laughing, their tamlas FLYING behind them.
AMSTERDAM (V.O.)
And I'll know that time, know it right off when it comes. Just like I
knew you.
114
The live action DISSOLVES TO... 
...  the last image in the montage: an ILLUSTRATION of Amsterdam, a half-decade older, turned out in fancy clothes, but with all his fierceness intact. This is a magazine illustration, and there is a dated headline over his picture: "Fresh Scourge of the Five Points." The date reads "June, 1863.11
AMSTERDA.M (V.O.)
And just like that, there'll be no way of stopping till it's ended.
From this illustration, we quickly... 
DISSOLVE TO
EXT. RIVER DAY
...  Amsterdam, as he is in the picture, but in live action, SPRINGING to his feet and YELLING at a couple of PRIZEFIGHTERS doing battle in a ring.
AMSTERDAM
Now! Finish him now!
Far up the sparkling Hudson, a RAFT floats slowly upstream. It's a huge thing (perhaps half a city block in size) crowded with SPORTSMEN. They form a LARGE RING around two mammoth PRIZEFIGHTERS who are brawling with bare knuckles. Amsterdam and Johnny are among the spectators.
JOHNNY
Our man will take him in another five. What puts you in such a hurry?
FIGHTER 1 fetches FIGHTER 2 a powerful roundhouse punch that sends him CRASHING to the deck. As soon as he hits the floor, a CARD GIRL appears carrying a sign announcing "Round 37.11 SECONDS drag the stupefied Fighter 2 to his corner, while two BOYS minister to Fighter 1, SUCKING THE BLOOD off his knuckles.
A GONG sounds to announce the appearance, in the center of the ring, of the fight promoter, a florid and fulsome P.T. Barnum .
BARNUM
I want to extend thanks and admiration not only to our two combatants
today, but to their sponsors, the Dead Rabbits ... 
(indicates one side of the ring)
...  and the Native Americans.
He FLINGS an expansive arm toward the opposite side of the ring, where
115
Bill the Butcher sits with Daniel Killoran and a large group of Natives. Amsterdam and the Butcher eye each other with all the old animosity: it's almost ceremonial now, part of the Tradition.
BARNUM
Their generous support allows me to bring you this splendid
exhibition.
With their indulgence I'd like to remind you also of the further
wonders
that await you at my new Museum, located on Broadway... 
There are BOOS from the crowd at such untoward commercialism.
BARNUM
...  P.T Barnum's gallery of wonders from worlds natural and unnatural,
from nature and from myth!
(continued boos)
And to encourage you also in the view that new Albany ordinances
forbidding sportive violence on land shouldn't dampen your enthusiasm
for
wagering. Bets down, entlegen, and you gents..
(indicated fighters)
...  fists up!
The Fighters come to center ring, circle each other, then start slugging. A flurry of punches, and Fighter 2 GOES DOWN again. As he hits the deck, the round automatically ends and the between-rounds ritual takes place again.
JOHNNY
Dobbs will take him this round. That'll be something. The Natives has
never lost before.
AMSTERDAM
Because there's never been a Dead Rabbit fighting before.
JOHNNY
That'll shame them thorough.
AMSTERDAM
There'll be worse than shaming. We only got the Natives in range.
It's time to squeeze the trigger, John.
The next round begins and the Fighters set to, MAULING each other furiously.
JOHNNY
Don't push the Natives too far, Amsterdam. Otherwise it'll be Tammany
pushing back.
116
AMSTERDAM
That don't matter any more.
JOHNNY
It does matter, and it's going to matter even more. Tammany's the
heart
and future of this city. If the Rabbits is going to keep growing,
we're
going to have to throw in with Tammany some way.
The action in the ring is FURIOUS. The Crowd cheers. Fighter 1 seems about to go down, but recovers and starts returning punishment to Fighter 2.
JOHNNY
They got that Conscription Act from Washington keeping them busy, but
they
won't leave us alone forever. And the Natives is strong as they ever
been!
In the ring, Fighter 1 drives Fighter 2 to the deck again, and this time KNOCKS HIM COLD.
AMSTERDAM
(indicates Fighter 1)
You call that strong, John?
In the ring, a couple of agitated NATIVE AMERICANS are trying to get at the Rabbit-sponsored winner. RABBITS start to RUSH the ring but Amsterdam WAVES them back.
AMSTERDAM
(to Johnny)
This is our time now!
BARNUM
(trying to make official announcement)
The winner...  gentlemen, please! ...  the winner in the 39th round is
the
Dead Rabbits champion, High Water Dobbs ...  please, gentlemen!
The unofficial ring COMBAT continues, knocking Barnum about, as the
new
champ throws marauding Natives around like empty flower sacks.
Amsterdam
iumps into the fray, PUSHES some Natives away. They start for him but
the
champ stands them off while Amsterdam WHISPERS to Barnum.
BARNUM
Just a moment, please, gentlemen! There's a word for us all. Amsterdam
promises ... 
117
(Amsterdam whispers to him briefly)
...  something large, something grand, something epic. The greatest
these
are my own words, of course the greatest righting of the gravest wrong
ever done in the Five Points.
The crowd quiets, their sporting blood still up, curiosity engaged.
Only Johnny seems glum, concerned.
This is to be a duel not for money, but for honor! A fight to the death... 
AMSTERDAM
(interrupting, emphasizing)
To the death. If he can stand up to it.
BARNUM
...  on which money, I hasten to add, may certainly be wagered. The
names
of the two champions are Amsterdam Vallon, here beside me, and ...  and
Mr.
William Poole, known to all as ... 
BILL THE BUTCHER
(leaping up)
They know me by any name, you son of a bitch!
The crowd ERUPTS: this is a death match between Olympians. Only Johnny does not rejoice. He looks at Amsterdam's face, flush with the belief that the right moment has finally come, and he has to turn away. He walks away from the ring as Killoran tries unsuccessfully to PULL the Butcher down and cool him off.
BILL THE BUTCHER
(yelling)
I'll have him stretched on a spit!
Killoran is beside him now, whispering urgently. Bill the Butcher shakes his head vehemently.
BILL THE BUTCHER
(to Killoran)
You got no more to say about this now.
AMSTERDAM
Come on, Bill! Let go of your Tammany wet nurse! My challenge, your
terms.
KILLORAN
(to Bill)
118
Don't do it, you can't do it! There's the Conscription to deal with,
and
elections coming, too. That's your calling now, not these ancient
quarrels.
BILL THE BUTCHER
I'll do my work. But this is a shame, a public shame. It demands my
attention.
(yelling to Amsterdam)
Fine, then! Fine and welcome! Day after elections, we'll meet with
seconds
on neutral ground to work out time and terms. It will be done and
done.
He walks to the ring, holds his HAND out to Amsterdam.
BILL THE BUTCHER
You know this hand. Last time it was this close, it was on your
throat.
AMSTERDAM
I remember it better from another time.
He takes the Butcher's hand. The duel is on.
CUT TO
INT./EXT. DRAFT REGISTRATION OFFICE
START CLOSE ON: money being counted out: $300. And a RECEIPT quickly written and given. We think at first this must be a bet being made on the duel between Amsterdam and Bill the Butcher-
But we go WIDER to reveal: an office, tables and chairs, and a line. Two lines, in fact. One, very long, filled with young man. And the second, very short, in which a CLERK is handing the receipt to a PROSPEROUS YOUNG MAN.
CLERK
Your release from service, according to the terms of the Conscription
Act.
Keep it somewhere safe.
PROSPEROUS YOUNG MAN
I'll keep it with me.
There is only one OTHER PERSON standen behind the Prosperous Young Man, and he steps up quickly and hands $300 to the Clerk as the Prosperous Young Man heads for the door... past the second line, which snakes out into the street, filled with draftees who SHOUT at the Prosperous Young Man as he leaves.
119
DRAFTEE 1
Hey, tell your Papa to pass me three hundred dollars too.
DRAFTEE 2
Tell him if he don't we'll come get you on our way to Gettysburg.
The Prosperous Young Man HURRIES away, but spots Boss Tweed and Daniel Killoran as he leaves.
PROSPEROUS YOUNG MAN
Oh, Mr. Tweed, I'd take the time to say proper thanks but... 
BOSS TWEED
No thanks owed, son. Conscription's Federal Law, and so's the $300 exemption. You might remind your father, though, that you saw me here today, minding that the law's strictly and equitably enforced.
The Prosperous Young Man hurries out, as the Draftees continue to holler abuse. Boss Tweed HEADS for them, followed by Killoran.
KILLORAN
You see how much they like this damned law? Enforcing it's going to
hurt
us in elections.
