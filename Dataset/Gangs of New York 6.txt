BOSS TWEED
It's not my law, and not my liking, either. But Washington's always treated us with sufferance, and we must extend the same regard to them.
(to Draftees)
Boys, we are bound by honor and love of country to fight in this time
of
crisis!
DRAFTEE 4
We're bound by our wallets and the emptiness in them, that's what!
BOSS TWEED
Boys, the union is in distress, our land is wounded deeply, our future
is
suddenly a frail and finite thing. We must ask ourselves how... 
DRAFTEE 5
Yeah, you could talk a dog off a meat wagen, Tweed. But let's see you
fight!
DRAFTEE 6
That'd be worth twice three hundred dollars to see!
BOSS TWEED
(as he backs off)
Thank you, boys, thank you for your understanding.
120
(to Killoran)
Holy Mother.
Tweed hustles Killoran outside, where the line of Potential draftees snakes down the block and into Paradise Square.
BOSS TWEED
Daniel, between the blindness of Washington and the damned brass of
Bill
Poole Tammany will fall like an autumn leaf. We must take what
measures we
can. Attend to the Butcher. After the elections, of course. Unless you
think Amsterdam will do our work for us first.
KILLORAN
He could at that. Then he would become a fresh concern
BOSS TWEED
Not so daunting as this.
(turns to the Draftees in the street)
Boys, I've just had a word with your compatriots inside, and if you
show
half the sand and a fraction of the spirit they have manifeste for
joining
this great struggle... 
There is a chorus of BOOS and JEEPS from the Draftees outside.
OUTSIDE DRAFTEE
Put a rope around it, Tweed, and swing in your own wind!
BOSS TWEED
Great weeping Jesus, Daniel, whatever happened to the halcyon days?
CUT TO
EXT. POLLING PLACE/PARADISE SQUARE DAY
Election Day pandemonium. The Dead Rabbits aren't working the repeaters this day, but Johnny observes the action as Native Americans—identifiable because of their long dusters—strongarm REPEATERS into the polls.
His attention is drawn to a HARRIED TELEGRAPH OPERATOR, who is being SHOUTED at by Natives as he is inundated by pieces of paper and teetering volumes of the voting registry. It's chaos. The poor Operator can't cope.
121
CUT TO
INT. TAMMANY HALL
It's chaos here, too. The large main room is filled with TELEGRAPH OPERATORS receiving election returns. There is SHOUTING and CONCERN throughout the room. Even Boss Tweed shows signs of worry.
BOSS TWEED
I swear that science will be the death of industry.
KILLORKN
The telegraph moves the voter tabulation by wire faster than we can
get
the repeaters in and out.
BOSS TWEED
(losing patience)
Your role is to expedite, Daniel, not to explain.
(Killoran looks at him blankly)
Do something!
JOHNNY
If you'll allow me.
They both TURN to see Johnny standing coolly before them.
JOHNNY
There's a scheme we might try.
KILLORAN
You got no place among us, get the hell out of here however you come
in.
BOSS TWEED
A moment please, Daniel. One moment.
(to Johnny)
You're a Dead Rabbit, aren't you? Friend to Amsterdam?
(Johnny nods)
And therefore no particular friend to us. What brings you here?
JOHNNY
Opportunity. Science and opportunity.
KILLORAN
You got opportunities enough among your own.
JOHNNY
I did have. But times change faster than people. Some people, anyhow.
And
I like to stay with the advantage.
122
BOSS TWEED
Well, then, a Gentleman of foresight! Are you suggesting...  or perhaps you're even saying...  that your friend and your gang may be ...  well, lagging behind the great march of history?
JOHNNY
Something like that, yeah.
BOSS TWEED
Well fine, step up to history then and tell us what you have in mind.
CUT TO
EXT. POLLING PLACE/PARADISE SQUARE DAY
START CLOSE ON: telegraph wire, HUMMING with the election returns. And, below it--far below--Johnny, Killoran and a couple of TAMMANY BOYOS, looking up at the wire.
BOYO 1
I ain't goin' up there. I got my election suit on.
JOHNNY
This election'll be over unless we get up there.
KILLORAN
"We?" This was your notion, you go up there.
BOYO 2
(looking at polling place)
Him. He looks likely, and he ain't workin'.
He points over at Sheeny Mike Kurtz, who is observing the action at the polls.
JOHNNY
(calls to him)
Sheeny Mike, you want to make ... 
(to Boyo 1)
... how much?
BOYO 1
A dollar.
JOHNNY
(to Sheeny Mike)
Five dollars? Just to help us?
SHEENY MIKE
(a bit wary)
What's the pitch, Johnny? Amsterdam wouldn't like it, working with Tammany.
123
BOYO 2
Well, now, if Amsterdam wouldn't like it ... 
JOHNNY
(interrupting)
He knows about it. Welre working a whole new scheme. But I won't tell
him
youlre helping, if that's the way you want it. And you can keep the
full
five. Just start climbing.
SHEENY MIKE
(beat)
Where's the ned?
Boyo 2 hands Sheeny Mike five bucks, which he pockets as Boyo 1 gives him
a large pair of SHEARS. Mike wipes his palms on his pants and STARTS UP the pole.
For Killoran and the Tammany Boyos, this is like a circus stunt. They watch Mike's ascent with pleasure.
Sheeny Mike is quite pleased with himself as he nears the top of the pole. He turns to look at Johnny and the Tammany group below. A couple of SPECTATORS have stopped to watch as well.
Mike gets to the top of the pole, REACHES OUT--STRETCHES OUT-toward the telegraph wire with the shears... 
...  strains...  reaches ...  MAKES THE CUT.
On the ground, Johnny looks relieved. The Boyos offer a partmocking round of applause.
In the spirit of things, Sheeny Mike TURNS to acknowledge the applause. Just briefly. But long enough so he's distracted. He sees the upturned FACES fill suddenly with fear, and he TURNS when he HEA.RS a sharp, odd WHISTLING NOISE.
A LIVE TELEGRAPH WIRE is coming at him. He doesn't even have time to scream. The wire hits him, whipping around him as JOLTS OF NT leap through his body and he FALLS to the ground.
CUT TO
EXT. PARADISE SQUA.RE DAY
HANDS pick up the lifeless body of Sheeny Mike and start to carry it off...  past Amsterdam and Jenny, who stand on one side of it, watching... and Johnny, who is on the other.
124
JOHNNY
He was working a Tammany job, Tammany will see to him.
AMSTERDAM
He wasn't Tammany. Not like you.
JOHNNY
He made the right choice.
AMSTERDAM
You don't know what you're saying! You killed one of our own. One of
your
family!
JOHNNY
(slowly)
I didn't know he was going to die, Amsterdam. And don't tell me what's
my
own and what isn't. You're not my family. And I swear, I swear on the Virgin Mother's eyes ...  I know what I'm doing, Amsterdam. It's you that's
always been blind.
(they look at each other)
I'll say my farewells.
Johnny KNEELS down beside Mike's body, brushes the hair from his brow.
JOHNNY
You still smell like drink.
He nods to the Rabbits to carry the body on and, as he RISES a half-dozen NEWSBOYS DASH into the square, carrying fresh copies of the Tribune and crying... 
NEWSBOYS
New Tammany victory! Fernando Wood elected to third term! Tammany
ticket
prevails by narrow margin! Boss Tweed vows
Armageddon for crime!
JOHNNY
(looking at Amsterdam and Jenny)
Can't you hear the future?
He walks away from the gang, through the rushing Newspaper Boys.
125
CUT TO
INT. SPARROW'S CHINESE PAGODA
The place has been cleared out for a war council: Amsterdam with a couple of Dead Rabbits, and Bill the Butcher with a few Natives. They sit at a round poker table with a green felt top.
JIMMY SPOILS
We say the Square is the place. Let Barnum sell the tickets for a
share of
the price... 
NATIVE SECOND
(interrupting)
A small share.
JIMMY SPOILS
And the Rabbits and Natives will split the majority portion equal.
NATIVE SECOND
Who works the crowd?
AMSTERDAM
Nobody. This is a day of honor. No pickpockets, no lush-rollers,
nothing.
BILL THE BUTCHER
I'll cut their hands off. After the fight.
NATIVE SECOND
We got to fix positions for everyone so there won't be no other
fighting.
I know for fact the Roach Guards has sworn blood against the Black
Birds,
and the Forty Thieves don't tolerate the Chichesters.
As these delicate negotiations continue, the only two outsiders in the place, Mother Joyce and a Bartender, are listening intently on the far side of the room.
BARTENDER
Amsterdam will make the Butcher a fine banquet.
MOTHER JOYCE
My ned's on the boy. He's got the youth, and he's got the hunger.
BARTENDER
Is he so hungry you'll put up a hundred?
MOTHER JOYCE
Two.
126
CUT TO
EXT. PARADISE SQUARE DAY
OFFICIALS stand on a high wooden platform facing a JEERING CROWD. Banners announce a "DRAFT LOTTERY." OFFICIALS are preparing to draw the first numbers as Boss Tweed gives out with a speech.
BOSS TWEED
Your honor...  yes, and the law of the land...  lies in the balance. The Conscription Act of 1863 was handed down by President Lincoln himself ... 
CROWD MEMBER
(shouting)
If Lincoln signed it, then let Lincoln fight!
CROWD MEMBER 2
It's an army of the poor fighting for a bunch of rich slackers!
CROWD MEMBER
Tammany's been our voice, let Tammany pay the exemption for all!
A YOUNG MEMBER of the crowd steps forward as Boss Tweed turns to look at those backing him on the platform: Killoran, a CAVALRY OFFICER in fancy dress ...  and, out of sight of the crowd, Johnny Sirocco. Their expressions are not reassuring.
YOUNG CROWD MEMBER
Your first payment, m'lords.
The Young Crowd Member hurls a STONE through the front window of a nearby store. The CROWD cheers and runs to sack the store, and others SURGE toward the platform. Johnny'and Killoran grab a fearful Tweed and rush him to safety. But the Cavalry Officer stands his ground with sword and pistol. He SHOOTS.
That STOPS them. But only for a fractured, eerie moment. Then they jump on the Cavalry Officer, PULL him to the ground, begin to KICK and BEAT him.
CUT TO
EXT. STREET/JACOB'S LADDER NIGHT
A building burns at the end of the street, spreading a silhouette of smoke and flame in the air... 
...  as a LION CHARGES down the street, growling, scattering RIOTERS in its wake. It's a mad, frightening sight, like a fulfillment of the
127
Biblical prophecy produced by P.T Barnum, whose Museum is burning in the distance.
SCREAMS, YELLS, CURSES and GROANS. CRIES of pain and fear as RIOTERS jump out of the way of the wild animal, then course up the street toward Broadway burning in the distance.
From ABOVE, on the roof of Jacob's Ladder, Amsterdam and Jenny watch the madness below.
AMSTERDAM
(watching lion)
That must be the vanguard of Barnum's army.
JENNY
This city will burn like Gomorrah.
AMSTERDAM
Then we'll take what we can before it gets too hot.
JENNY
I think it's past that already.
AMSTERDAM
It'll never come to that. These people ain't gang-led and they have no
purpose.
They'd rather die for themselves than the army, that's the purpose.
What
would you do?
AMSTERDAM
Fight better and not get so mad. They're only doing what they should
have
done years ago. Why'd they ever think there was another way to live?
JENNY
They believed what people told them, that's all.
AMSTERDAM
What people is that? The Reverend at the mission? Boss Tweed? Daniel
Killoran? People like Johnny Sirocco?
JENNY
You believed Johnny.
AMSTERDAM
Hell.
JENNY
And I believed you.
128
AMSTERDAM
I ain't done nothing different than what I told you, Jen.
JENNY
I believed what you said abaut being with me, with me alone. But you
lied
to me. It's not me alone, it's just you and Bill Poole. Youlre so
blood-blind you can't see nothing else, not even this!
AMSTERDAM
I don't care a fine damn about what they want! It's what I want! They won't dare harm the Points, that's all I care about! Let them turn the rest of the city into hell! It's another country anyway.
JENNY
It's not a country for me, Amsterdam. I don't know about you. Will you
come with me?
AMSTERDAM
Not now.
JENNY
Now is when I'm going. Will you come?
AMSTERDAM
I don't want all this fighting to go to waste, Jen. I want to come out
of
it with something. And I got to be waiting for the Butcher.
CUT TO
INT. UNDERGROUND/JACOB'S LADDER
Jenny digs out her treasure from her mother's grave, throws open the box, starts to GRAB all the swag she can and hide it on her person... 
in her pockets, under her clothes, anywhere. She takes as much as she can, but she has to travel fast.
CUT TO
EXT. STREET NIGHT
Beginning a swift series of scenes that are like a laudanum nightmare.
The street is JAMMED with people fleeing and people fighting...  as Jenny forces her way through, trying to escape.
A small mob starts to ATTACK a house where a TERRIFIED FAMILY stands in the doorway.
FAMILY MAN
We're with you, don't harm us!
129
MOB MAN
Show us your spirit and come out with us then!
MOB WOMAN
And put a candle in the window to show you're one with us! Every light
is
a flame against the draft!
The WIFE begs her husband not to join the mob, but they PULL HIM out into the street. The Mob Woman hands the Wife a candle, then runs back to join the mob.
Jenny starts to cross Paradise Square now...  tries to cross, anyway...  and passes the stand where Tweed delivered his speech that very morning. She sees: the Cavalry officer. Several MOB WOMEN have revived him with water. He has been beaten terribly, but as he MOANS and starts to regain consciousness, the MOB WOMEN fall upon him with fresh fury, KICKING and HITTING his helpless body. They BREAK his bones with rocks and TEAR OFF the fancy braid of his uniform to hang around their necks.
Now a SECOND MOB RUSHES toward the first from the opposite side of Paradise Square. Chaos. Jenny is buffeted wildly. It's like being in a whirlpool. She grabs a LITTLE GIRL whose face is bruised and blaody but whose eyes shine wildly.
JENNY
What is it?
LITTLE GIRL
Cops has everything closed to the north, and the militia's coming.
CUT TO
EXT. STREET/FIVE POINTS NIGHT
As Jenny presses her way through the mob-devoured streets. She sees:
MEN, WOMEN and CHILDREN attacking a small group of BLACKS.
BOY
My Daddy don't have to die for you! Why should he fight and die for
you?
Jenny looks ahead, sees: the river, in the distance. And flames. She runs forward, STUMBLES. Some of the swag FALLS to the street. She SCRAMBLES to pick it up as Rioters rush by her.
CUT TO
EXT. PIERS HUDSON RIVER NIGHT
130
MATTE: The surface of the water looks like a mirror made of flame. The piers are BURNING. The docks are ash.
SAILORS battle a MOB for possession of a small rowboat. As they fight, the boat starts to DRIFT. Jenny spots it, RUNS for it
...  but so does ANOTHER GIRL. Younger than Tenny--20 maybe, Jennyls age when Amsterdam fell in love with her. They both get to the boat at the same time. Each grips it by a gunwale, and they STARE at each other like two jungle beasts over a kill.
JENNY
I'd kill you for this.
The Girl lunges at her with a knite, and Jenny SHOOTS. The GIRL slides into the flame-reflecting Hudson as if she drowning in a pit of lava.
Jenny climbs into the boat and frantically starts to row. We stay CLOSE on her ...  working the oars clumsily, furiously ...  moving the boat across the water, trying to get away from the city... 
...  and we go WIDER now. A huge line of IRON--like the side of a glacier...  bisects the frame, then starts to move. Jenny turns, SEES it. It is ... 
...  the looming hull of an ironclad war ship (MATTE). It LOBS cannon fire into the city, setting off tremendous explosions. Jenny TURNS back for the shore... 
...  as cannonballs land, devastating rioters.
CUT TO
EXT. SHORE/RIVER NIGHT
MATTE: Police and MILITIA push the rioters back toward the river like rats. A cannanball EXPLODES in their midst... 
...  injuring many more cops and militia than rioters. The rioters rally, RUN over the bodies of fallen cops and soldiers. Now the advantage is theirs; cops and militia are in retreat.
Jenny climbs up on shore and joins the mob as it presses back inland.
CUT TO
EXT. DOYERS STREET/THE BLOODY ANGLE NIGHT
Further from the docks. Shells still exploding in the distance. Jenny moves with the marauding mob, recognizes Doyers Street. She splits away from the mob, moves stealthily into the street known as the Bloody Angle. And STOPS.
131
Weird shadows dance on the walls of the buildings. SMOKE and EERIE LIGHT. The angle is lined with lampposts. And from every lamppost dangles the BODY of a black man. Or woman. Or child. Some are still smouldering.
At the base of a lamppost, a group of RIOTERS have cut open the hog-tied CORPSE of a black man and are pouring oil into it. One of the Rioters sees Jenny, grins and holds out the TORCH he's holding. She shakes her head and starts to BACK out of the alley.
The Rioter touches the torch to the oil in the wound of the corpse. The body IGNITES in flame. The RIOTERS pull on a rope and the body rises, burning, to the top of the lamppost ... 
...  where its awful shadow joins all the others in the madhouse refractions on walls all up and down the street. On the street, as the flames dance and the bodies burn, rioters DANCE and SING. Walpurgis Night. From these mad SHADOWS, we... 
DISSOLVE TO
EXT. ROOF/JACOB-S LADDER NIGHT
...  the face of Amsterdam, stepping out of the SHADOWS of the roof. There are flames in the distance. The whole gang is assembled, facing him as he speaks.
AMSTERDAM
No we ain't going to fight, but we can take something for ourselves
out of
this.
JIMMY SPOILS
I want to know who hung them bodies in the Bloody Angle. I want to
address
who done it.
AMSTERDAM
Five thousand people in the street done it! Boss Tweed done it! Abe Lincoln done it! There's nothing you can do about any one of them but stay
with us. You'll have a little of your own back.
JIMMY SPOILS
How's that?
AMSTERDAM
These riots are a gift. They... 
132
...  he PAUSES just for a moment as he sees a hand on the last rung of the outside ladder leading to the roof: it's Jenny, returning.
AMSTERDAM
...  they've made everything clear, as you might say.
(to Jenny)
Are you with us, then?
JENNY
Until I can get out. I'll go with you... 
(straight at Amsterdam)
... meantime.
AMSTERDAM
Good. We're going for the Armory at Canal Street.
JIMMY SPOILS
The Armory! We'll have to beat the militia to get there.
AMSTERDAM
There's a way through the lines. Jen, did you see the cops and
militia?
JENNY
I can show you from here where they are. I doubt they'll get to the
Armory
in force before midday tomorrow.
AMSTERDAM
We'll get there first. We'll take everything we can carry, and destroy
the
rest so no one else has the use of it, the militia, the Natives,
nobody.
Then we'll turn to real business. We'll go down to the Battery.
JIMMY SPOILS
Why, we going to take a sail to Europe?
AMSTERDAM
No. But we could, after this. We're going... 
(slowly, savoring this)
... we're going to take the banks. The government banks.
(awed silence from all)
Are we not?
JENNY
(beat; steps forward)
Seems we are.
One by one, then in small groups, the entire gang FOLLOWS her. They are uncertain, reluctant, even frightened at the audacity of the scheme. But they stand with Amsterdam.
133
CUT TO
NT. MAIN ROOM/TAMMANY HALL NIGHT
The crowded main room of Boss Tweed's domain, jammed with anxious POLITICOS and OFFICIALS, as well as a harried group of TELEGRAPH OPERATORS who receive news of the riots from all over Manhattan. There is a huge map of the city against one wall: the place has been converted from a political princedom to an operational headquarters. Johnny Sirocco and Bill The Butcher are there. Other guests include the GOVERNOR, Mayor Fernando Wood, and a badly shaken Horace Greeley.
GREELEY
They attacked me! I had every sympathy for them at first... 
BOSS TWEED
Too much sympathy, Horace. Writing these riots were a rising against
"unjust laws and unsuitable law-givers." The shame!
GOVERNOR
I suspended the draft at noon but the mobs only grew more virulent. It is a criminal rising of the lowest class, of the Gangsters and rabble who have been allowed by Tammany to run lawless!
BOSS TWEED
It was Tammany and the rabble that elected you, Governor. And it's
Tammany
and the gangs who'll stop it. Isn't that so, Bill?
BILL THE BUTCHER
(nods at Johnny)
I won't say nothin' in front of him. Who knows what business he's here
on?
BOSS TWEED
He's here on our business and my invitation. He's already been of
great
help. What's the opposition strength, John?
To answer, Johnny yanks back a CURTAIN drawn across a high window. The view, looking downtown, is one of almost continual ILLUMINATION—every place the eye falls, CANDLES burn in sympathy for the rioters.
JOHNNY
Each candle is against you, gents.
MAYOR
"Against you," sir? Don't you mean "us".
134
JOHNNY
(diplomatic)
Some of us come from those people, Mayor. I'll not deny they still
claim
part of me.
MAYOR
Which part? Perhaps your heart.
BOSS TWEED
Gentlemen, I'm sorry you find it necessary to question the loyalty of
my
friend here, and by extension, my own judgement. So as proof ...  John,
where will the mob go? What will the gangs do?
(Johnny is uneasy about answering)
Go on, tell them what you told me.
JOHNNY
There's no telling about the mob. Or the small gangs. But the Dead
Rabbits
...  if I was Amsterdam... 
BOSS TWEED
(interrupting)
As indeed you nearly was. Were.
JOHNNY
...  if I was ...  I'd figure to take the Rabbits to the Armory.
BOSS TWEED
Would you agree with that, Bill? Wouldn't you do the same? If you were
fighting against the militia instead of beside them?
BILL THE BUTCHER
Beside them? What are you talking...  ?
BOSS TWEED
(interrupting)
You will have to fight beside them to take the Armory. It cannot fall
into
unfriendly hands.
BILL THE BUTCHER
I can't stand with the militia against the people. I could never work
the
Points no more if I did.
BOSS TWEED
We're all of us swept up in a great tide of events, Bill. Have you
learned
to swim?
135
From Bill's face, struggling to make sense of this, knowing Tweed's
right
but not wanting to believe it, we ... 
DISSOLVE TO
INT. MAIN ROOM/TAMMANY HALL NIGHT
...  Johnny's face, as Tweed talks to him. It is later, and the Butcher has left. The activity is still frantic all around, but Tweed speaks in unhurried tones.
BOSS TWEED
I'm sure that Bill will do his usual splendid job. But after that ... 
well, I'm afraid he's grown away from us.
(Johnny looks puzzled)
He shows distressing signs of...  shall we say, free-thinking. Crime flourishes in chaos, and these riots could encourage Bill to overstep himself. He no longer inspires in me the same trust...  well, that you might. If you can prove yourself further.
JOHNNY
You already said in front of everyone you trusted me.
BOSS TWEED
In vital things. Would I be talking to you now otherwise? Vital
things,
but small things. Are you equal to greater responsibility and
opportunity?
JOHNNY
Such as what?
BOSS TWEED
Ridding me of Bill the Butcher.
(Johnny is startled)
He may question your loyalty to me, but Bill would never believe you
had
the sand to go against him. He'd never expect it. Do you have the
sand?
From Johnny's face, struggling to make the right answer, we... 
DISSOLVE TO
INT. JACOB'S LADDER
...  Ansterdam's face, as he looks up from preparing a brace of pistols for the next day's scheme.
136
AMSTERDAM
Let him in.
Johnny enters the common room of Jaccb's Ladder, where the Dead Rabbits have gathered to ready themselves. As they work over their weapons and prepare battle dress, Johnny walks through their midst. They do not acknowledge him...  except for Jenny.
JENNY
Did you miss us, John?
JOHNNY
Not a bit.
AMSTERDAM
(rising to meet him)
Are you here to spy?
JOHNNY
I don't have to spy.
Amsterdam leads Johnny off to a shadowy corner of the room where they can talk privately.
JOHNNY
(as they walk)
I know what you're doing. I told Tweed what you're doing.
AMSTERDAM
You don't know what I'm doing.
JOHNNY
You're going after the Armory.
AMSTERDAM
Am I now? Why do you think that?
JOHNNY
'Cause that's what I would do, and you and I think alike.
AMSTERDAM
No more. And it don't seem worth a visit to tell me something you
already
think I'm doing.
JOHNNY
There's something else alright. Tweed's arranged to kill Bill the
Butcher.
AMSTERDAM
(disbelieving)
Who could Tweed get to do that?
137
JOHNNY
One of his own.
AMSTERDAM
There's no one around him... 
JOHNNY
(interrupting)
Listen, it don't matter who, it's going to be done, that's all! Tweed
ain't going to wait around
for you and Bill to settle yourselves. I'm telling you so you have a
chance.
AMSTERDAM
Chance of what?
JOHNNY
A chance...  a chance to do what you want. Bury the Butcher, draw what blood you got to. But you better make speed. The Natives will move on the
Armory too.
AMSTERDAM
And what's any of it mean to you?
JOHNNY
It means whatever's left of friendship, I don't know. There's still
part
of me here. I don't
want to see you lose everything in your life at once.
AMSTERDAM
I'm going to lose nothing.
(beat)
If you believe me, you can stay.
JOHNNY
I got to go.
He turns so Amsterdam can't see his face and LEAVES-
JENNY
So Tammany's going to kill the Butcher. That puts you and Tweed on the
same side. Does that make the path clear enough to suit you?
From Amsterdam's face, trying to work out all the new angles, we... 
138
DISSOLVE TO
INT. NATIVE AMERICAN HIDEOUT
...  Amsterdam's face, full of resolve, staring unblinking as ... 
...  the barrels of two dozen RIFLES SURROUND the edges the screen, boxing
Amsterdam in, as if his head were in a frame. And Bill the Butcher gazes at him with astonishment. We are, for the first time, in the Natives' lair, a house hung with American flags of all shapes
and vintages, some of them torn by battle, others by years of weather and use. Some of them go back to the early days of the republic. There is not an inch of wood or wall space to be seen for all the stars and stripes.
BILL THE BUTCHER
Murder Me? No one's going to murder me.
AMSTERDAM
Then you better learn to fight locking over your shoulder, Bill,
because
that's the only way you'll ever see it coming.
BILL THE BUTCHER
I don't believe it, and I don't believe it's you telling me. You got
no
reason to care about any danger to me.
AMSTERDAM
One reason. You're my kill, Butcher. No one else is going to have you,
not
Tweed, not Tammany, not those pigs in the street. No one--not even
you,
Bill--will ever take the pleasure of your death away from me. I'd do
anything to keep you for my own, even if I have to protect you.
BILL THE BUTCHER
You protect me? Get out of here and go to hell.
AMSTERDAM
Fine, so long as I pass you on my way.
BILL THE BUTCHER
Maybe I'd believe you more if I knew who was talking to you.
AMSTERDAM
Someone I credit.
BILL THE BUTCHER
That means nothing to me. None of this means nothing to me because I
am
139
Tammany. Without me and my Natives they're nothing but a bunch of old horses at a trough.
AMSTERDAM
You join with me and we fight against Tammany, fight them back and out
of
the Points. Then you and me can settle. But if you don't join with me, then there won't be no settlement because you'll be murdered in the street
and the whole Points will be mine.
BILL THE BUTCHER
I relish the thought...  just the thought...  of cutting you up and
opening
you wide. So if just thinking about it gives me such pleasure, imagine
how
I'm going to enjoy doing it.
AMSTERDAM
Why don't I make it easy for you, then.
He TURNS his back on the Butcher and starts to walk out, through the entire gang of Natives.
AMSTERDAM
Same as you're making it easy for Tweed.
He keeps walking...  through the Natives ...  dozens of ancient enemies glowering at him.
BILL THE BUTCHER
Amsterdam!
(Amsterdam looks around)
Don't be like your father. Don't make it too easy.
Amsterdam struggles to keep his temper. But he turns and keeps walking through the enemy camp as we...

... .Amsterdam walking. But this time, he is WALKING among his gang.
All the Dead Rabbits are assembled, weapons ready. Jenny is beside him. Then Jimmy Spoils. Then a few others.
As the group passes, others STAND and walk with them... 
...  until the whole gang is rallied...  and bound for the passageway in the corner of the room that leads under the building.

DISSOLVE TO
INT. BASEMENT
As Amsterdam and the gang heads through the catacomb-like basement, past the graves, into a tunnel. Torchlight GUTTERS all around. Their steps echo like repeated rifle shots.
DISSOLVE TO
INT. TUNNEL
The whole gang MARCHES down a tunnel under the Old Brewery. Except for Amsterdam and Jenny, they all wear their tamlas. Many have marks and gang insignia on their faces. All of them have weapons. A lot of weapons.
Frightened FACES--people seeking shelter and safety from the riots— appear in the darkness, then vanish like ghosts.
As the Rabbits walk, they summon memories of the first fight, that same march through the tunnels when Amsterdam marched beside his father. Amsterdam's face gives little away. But perhaps he is remembering that day too.
DISSOLVE TO
INT. TUNNEL
The last tunnel.. Shreds of light from a door in the distance. Amsterdam walks up to the door and--just as Monk Eastman did years before--KICKS it down. Dim dawn LIGHT FLOODS the tunnel as the Dead Rabbits step out.
CUT TO
EXT. CANAL STREET DAWN
The first thing we see is an ELEPHANT, who trumpets fearfully at the sudden sound of the sattere door. The gang stops, wary of this huge refugee from Barnum's Museum, but the animal is more frightened of them.
It hurries on down the street... 
...  revealing behind it a group of several dozen RIOTERS who carry a huge American flag and a long wooden plank bearing the legend "No Draft." They stare at the Rabbits with something near reverence.
AMSTERDAM
Where's the Native Americans?

RIOTER
Ain't seen them. Ain't here.
AMSTERDAM
And the militia?
RIOTER
There's a detachment coming on from two streets over. The rest is
still
north of here. What are you after?
Amsterdam POINTS to a formidable building a block away: the Armory. It looks like a fortress.
RIOTER
The Devil himself couldn't take that place.
AMSTERDAM
That's why he sent us.
CUT TO
EXT. STREET NEAR ARMORY/ DAY
The DETACHMENT of militia proceeds warily towards the Armory. They are a young, uncertain-looking outfit; their COMMANDER looks like an upstate farm kid. He tenses and his eyes widen as he sees Jenny walking toward him, carrying a BOY in her arms.
JENNY
(crying)
Help me. Oh please help me. He's shot, we need a doctor, please help.
DETACHMENT COMMANDER
Miss, we ain't a medical outfit. The main unit's ten minutes behind
us,
they'll have... 
He doesn't get the chance to finish. Jenny DROPS the Boy from her arms and shoots the Detachment Commander once, cleanly... 
...  as the Boy roles into a prone position and FIRES two shots into the stunned Detachment... 
...  while the Dead Rabbits SWARM from every doorway along the street, FIRING GUNS and brandishing weapons.
It's over in seconds. The Detachment has hardly gotten off a shot.
Every one of them lies dead or wounded in the street... 
...  as the Rabbits CROUCH over their bodies.

CUT TO
EXT. ARMORY DAY
A rifle emplacement manned by a dozen GUARDS- They stand anxious post in front of the Armory. Each window is barred and fortified, and the front door is massive. But the tension in the Guards' faces eases a little when they see ... 
...  the Detachment of militia heading towards them down the street. Some of the Detachment are wearing bloody uniform jackets; several are being carried. The Detachment, unrecognized by the Guards, is made up entirely of Dead Rabbits.
AMSTERDAM
Help us, we got wounded!
GUARD 1
We can't leave the post.
AMSTERDAM
Open the damn doors then! We're bad hurt!
GUARD 1
Where's the others?
AMSTERDAM
Just behind us! But I got our major here wounded so bad half his guts
is
out!
Guard 1 SIGNALS for the doors to be opened to the Armory as the Detachment draws close to the emplacement.
GUARD 1
God, it's good to see you!
AMSTERDAM
Likewise.
Ainsterdam SHOOTS him where he stands as the Rabbits OVERWHELM the emplacement.
AMSTERDAM
(shouting)
Move fast! We got to get out with everything we can before the militia gets here!
As the Armory Guards return fire, the Boy Jenny carried in the previous scene RUNS for the telegraph pole and starts to CLIMB. A SHOT makes the wood fly inches from his face... 
143
...  as the Rabbits storm into the Armory, FIRING wildly.
The Boy reaches the top of the telegraph pole and CUTS the wire. He shinnies back down the pole as the wire SWINGS ineffectually in the air and we ...

..a telegram, held in Killoran's hand. He passes it to Tweed.
KILLORAN
It's from the Armory Guards. That's the last before the wire went
dead.
BOSS TWEED
(reading, furious)
If the Rabbits are already at the Armory, where the hell is Bill and
the
militia?
He THROWS the telegram onto the floor, where it joins a whole SEA of yellow telegraph forms. They are shin-high; there must be thousands of them.
KILLORAN
They got to be near.
JOHNNY
So long as they're near, it's alright. The Rabbits can take the
Armory,
but they can't hold it. If Bill can get into position, he can make
sure
they don't get out.
BOSS TWEED
Alright then, John, you pray to any God you choose that's the fact of
it.
If Bill thinks he can best the Natives, that is your opportunity. That
is
your moment.
(Johnny hesitates)
Are you a Bible man? The Book says in Revelations, "I saw a new heaven
and
a new earth." If the hand of God's not on you to fulfill that
prophecy,
then the hand of Tweed will be. Go on and God bless.
Johnny looks like he is about to say something, but he stops; looks at Tweed a moment longer; then nods acknowledgment and leaves.

GOVERNOR
I don't believe he can do it, Tweed.
BOSS TWEED
Oh, I think he can. Whether it's one man against another or a mob
against
the city, the mathematics remain the same. You never enjoyed the enlightenment of poverty, did you, Governor? If you had, you'd know you
can always hire half the poor to kill the other half
