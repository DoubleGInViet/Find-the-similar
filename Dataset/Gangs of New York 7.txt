EXT. ARMORY DAY
A TREMENDOUS VOLLEY of GUNFIRE, as if to illustrate the Tweed theory of class warfare. Bodies fall in the street. Bodies fall from the Armory. The building is under siege by the main unit of the MILITIA and by Bill the Butcher and the Natives. The Dead Rabbits are trapped.
Johnny SNAKES through the Native American lines, over dead bodies, moving towards Bill, who he sees a hundred yards away... 
...  running over corpses of comrades and enemies toward the MILITIA COMMADER. As SHOT WIDENS, the carnage is revealed. Bodies of Natives, in their uniform dusters, and Rabbits, in their tamlas, lie side by side in the street.
FIRING continues from both sides as the Butcher shouts at the Militia Commander.
BILL THE BUTCHER
We move now and we can drive them out! We press them and they'll
break!
MILITIA COMMANDER
I can't spare the men or stand the risk! We stay fast and smoke lem
out!
BILL THE BUTCHER
Tweed put me in charge of this! I say we move, and by the crucified
Christ
we will move!
(turns to his men)
Native Americans, come with me! Any militia that wants to live upright
instead of die hunkered down, come with us!
Bill STALKS through the lines, rallying the men. And Johnny starts to FOLLOW.
BILL THE BUTCHER
We'll show you gladiators' greatness! Come on!
145
The men start to JOIN the Butcher; even some militia fall in. Johnny SLIPS
through the men gathering near the Butcher. He's closer to Bill than ever.
Bill starts to mount their BARRICADE. There is MOVEMENT and commotion all around him as Natives and militia fall into rough formation. It threatens to obscure Bill from Johnny's view. Shield him.
He has to make his move. NOW. He DRAWS a revolver as militia and Natives pass in front of him...  he AIMS ...  he's anxious, confused ...  his HAND shakes ...  he fires...  too soon! ... 
...  and HITS a Native, who falls dead. Right near Bill.
The Butcher turns in the direction of the shot, SEES Johnny. Their eyes lock. Johnny FIRES again ...  WINGS Bill ... 
...  and Bill SHOOTS him. Johnny FALLS with the first shot. Bill's above him now, looking down at him.
BILL THE BUTCHER
Was it Tweed or your friend put you to this?
JOHNNY
Tweed.
Bill SHOOTS him again, point blank. Johnny screams.
BILL THE BUTCHER
You'd lie to save your friend.
JOHNNY
(in terrible pain)
No. There's no friends for me.
BILL THE BUTCHER
Me the same. Pity us both.
He EMPTIES his revolver into Johnny.
BILL THE BUTCHER
(to his men)
Hold your fire!
(toward the Armory)
In there! Hey in there! I want to talk to Amsterdam!
The Militia Commander is aghast at this proposition and starts forward, gun in hand. But a Native STOPS him.
Amsterdam's face APPEARS in a front window of the Armory.
146
AMSTERDAM
Go on, then, talk.
BILL THE BUTCHER
You and me.
AMSTERDAM
(beat)
Come ahead then. And bring my friend's body.
Bill the Butcher SLINGS Johnny's body over his shoulder as easily as if it were an empty sack of flour... 
...  and starts walking thraugh the lines toward the Armory. The Militia watches in disbelief, the Natives in confusion. The Dead Rabbits keep the Butcher in their sights. But no one fires. No one moves.
And Bill the Butcher enters the front doors of the Armory.
CUT TO
INT. ARMORY DAY
As the Butcher is admitted through the huge doors which clang SHUT quickly behind him. It's a scene of devastation inside-dozens of dead and wounded everywhere. And enough rifles and munitions to sink Manhattan island.
Bill the Butcher stands dead center in the middle of the Armory floor as Amsterdam walks toward him. The Butcher DROPS Johnny's body in a heap at his feet.
BILL THE BUTCHER
Your friend made different friends lately.
AMSTERDAM
Tammany's put us all in the same place. You want to get out alive?
BILL THE BUTCHER
It don't matter to me. I got enemies outside, enemies in here. The
militia
can move on me anytime. You could drop me before I get to the door.
AMSTERDAM
I don't want to lose you so easy. You'll never get past the militia
unless
you come with the Dead Rabbits.
BILL THE BUTCHER
You'd lay aside what's between us?
147
AMSTERDAM
I'm not forgetting where I put it.
BILL THE BUTCHER
If you do, I'll remind you.
(he turns, leaves)
AMSTERDAM
What's your call, Bill?
BILL THE BUTCHER
I'm considering where's my better chance.
He walks to the doors. The Rabbits guarding it don't make a move. He OPENS it himself and strides out into the street.
CUT TO
EXT./INT. ARMORY DAY
Bill walks alone toward the Native/militia lines.
From inside...  from every window ...  the Dead Rabbits watch him.
The sun is high, but the street is eerily quiet. There are FARAWAY SOUNDS of battle, but here there is only the sound of distant, unheard conversation between Bill, the Militia Commander and some Natives.
Amsterdam WATCHES intently.
The Butcher and the Militia Commander argue, but we still can't hear what they're saying. There is still no sound... 
...  until, SUDDENLY, we see the Militia Commander's face. Huge. EYES WIDE with surprise as we HEAR the thunderclap of a SHOT.
Bill the Butcher has just gutshot the Militia Commander.
As if the shot were a signal, the Natives TURN on the militia. It's hellish, close-quarter combat. Guns fired inches from enemies who had just been allies. Knives, swords, bludgeons, kids with dead-rat blackjacks, women with hob-nailed wooden planks, attacking better-armed but totally stunned soldiers.
Bill the Butcher falls back toward the Armory, the Natives following him.
Inside the Armory, Amsterdam turns to his own greatly diminished gang.
AMSTERDAM
Go ahead them, give them cover! Give them some damn cover!
148
The Rabbits are so stunned to be fighting on the same side as their sworn enemies that, even with Amsterdam's order, no one makes a move. It's Amsterdam who FIRES the first shots. And that unleashes a great VOLLEY from the Armory... 
...  toward the militia.
The Butcher and the Natives are closer to the Armory now...  and the Armory doors start to open... 
...  when a MILITIA LIEUTENANT SIGNALS ... 
...  and MILITIA on the surrounding roofs, waiting for this moment, suddenly open fire... on the Natives below and on the Rabbits on the roof
of the armory. Many drop in the street and fall from the Armory roof... 
...  as the Armory doors SWING WIDE to admit the Natives. As they run or
stagger inside, the Rabbits start to close the doors. Some Rabbits are cut down by the fire from the rooftops. Other Natives never make it to the doors. And a few are shot... 
...  when the doors close before they can get through.
CUT TO
INT./EXT. ARMORY DAY
The Dead Rabbits keep firing, but they have sustained grave losses. The Butcher looks around at the Natives who have made it inside with him: he has perhaps one-quarter of his original strength.
BILL THE BUTCHER
Well, it seems like between us we got two mobs that might make a gang.
AMSTERDAM
Whose gang might it be?
BILL THE BUTCHER
Not William Tweed's.
Jimmy Spoils and a crew of Natives PUSH a cannon toward the rear of the Armory.
AMSTERDAM
Which way you pointing that?
149
JIMMY SPOILS
Any way you say. One direction could let us out, the other will let
them
in.
BILL THE BUTCHER
They got to come in if we're going to fight them.
AMSTERDAM
Who do you want to fight, Bill?
Amsterdam MOTIONS toward the rear wall and Jimmy swings the cannon around.
Everything surrounding them is MOVEMENT and COMMOTION as the remaining members of both gangs TAKE whatever weapons they can carry from the Armory stockpile... 
...  and Jenny steps forward with a torch, LIGHTING the fuse of the cannon... 
...  which ROARS and BLOWS a huge hole in the rear wall of the Armory.
AMSTERDAM
(to Bill the Butcher)
See you in the street.
The gang members RUSH for the opening, carrying whatever they can manage.
Outside, the MILITIA LIEUTENANT hears the cannon blast...  sees no damage to the front of the building...  and SIGNALS for a frontal ASSAULT on the Armory.
HIGH ANGLE FROM ABOVE, CAMERA MOVING as the militia CHARGES ...  following them forward, then moving ahead to the Armory
...  SHOOTING straight down inside (no roof or ceiling) as the Gangs HURTLE through the still-smoldering hole in the wall ... 
...  and drop twenty feet to an alley below... 
...  where militia on the roof try to pick them off. As the militia presses closer from the front, gang defenses start to fall back inside the Armory. Everyone wants to get through that hole.
Amsterdam, Jenny, Jimmy Spoils and some of the other gang nembers are carrying TORCHES. Jenny HANDS a torch to the Butcher. Amsterdam MOTIONS them all toward the back of the Armory.
150
But he stays behind. Just for a moment. He BENDS over the crumpled body of Johnny Sirocco, ARRANGES it, folding JOHNNY'S HANDS across his chest.
AMSTERDAM
You'll have a warrior's funeral anyway, John.
He STANDS and RUNS for the hole in the wall, where Jenny and the others stand waiting.
He TURNS, takes a last look inside the Armory. The militia is BATTERING DOWN the front doors. Then he raises his TORCH over his head...  and HURLS it through the air. Jenny and the others do the same.
His single torch BLAZES a path of light across the screen. The others, JOINING it, make a fiery CONSTELLATION.
CUT TO
EXT. REAR OF ARMORY/STREETS BEHIND ARMORY DAY
As Jenny, Jimmy Spoils, Bill the Butcher and Amsterdam HURTLE through the hole into the alley below... 
...  and start to run through the withering GUNFIRE of the militia on the roof... 
...  getting away...  just barely away.
As Jenny runs, her swag drops and FALLS from under her clothes. She
TURNS to pick it up but Amsterdam PULLS her on... .
...  and just away from the titanic EXPLOSION of the Armory. The CONCUSSION throws some of the militia from their perches on the roof. It sends a fountain of FLAME and RUBBLE high into the sky. It is VOLCANIC in its brilliance and intensity. The sky turns BLACK with powder, BLAZING ORANGE with flame.
In the small streets BEHIND THE ARMORY, many gang members are CRUSHED by debris or burned by FIREBALLS breaking off from the central flame.
The Armory is gone. Much of the surrounding area is gone with it.
On the ground, everything is smoke, flame, dirt, death, confusion,
Corpses everywhere. Gang members and kids running all over, desperate.
It looks like the last day of mankind on earth.
Bill the Butcher HELPS a couple of fallen Natives, then SEES through the smoke and flame and storm of ash ...  Amsterdam. Coming towards him.
151
BILL THE BUTCHER
We're finished, all of us.
AMSTERDAM
But you and me ain't settled.
BILL THE BUTCHER
We got the same now, a full share of nothing. There's nothing to
settle.
There's nothing left.
Amsterdam takes a weapon from his pocket, OPENS it for the Butcher to see: it is the pirate's knife which the Butcher used to kill Priest Vallon.
AMSTERDAM
Then let's start over.
Bill the Butcher looks tired, sorrowful. He BURIES his face wearily in his arms. And for a moment we think he has given everything up. Amsterdam MOVES toward him, through the smoke. The Butcher does not even look at him. Of all the things he could do, this is the one that Amsterdam could not anticipate and does not know how to reckon.
AMSTERDAM
Look at me. Look at me!
But the Butcher will not obey. Amsterdam HESITATES.
And it's at that moment the Butcher LOOKS UP...  in a FLASH...  a pistol in his hand, a grin of triumph on his face...  and shoots. Amsterdam goes down.
The Butcher THROWS ASIDE his gun and takes out his CLEAVER...  walking through the smoke ... 
...  and past gang members who FLEE the explosion around them...  toward Amsterdam.
BILL THE BUTCHER
Don't look away, Amsterdam. You wanted this so long.
A HAZE of ash and gunpowder BLOWS across the Butcher's face, making him look like a phantom...  but making the ground where Amsterdam lies indistinct. For just a second.
But time enough. A WOODEN PLANK filled with NAILS cuts through the haze, catching the Butcher across the middle. He goes down howling... 
...  and Amsterdam, wounded in the leg, kneels before him. Then SPRINGS at him, pinning him like some crazed lover. The CLEAVER flies from the Butcherls grip.
152
The two men STRUGGLE desperately. But the gang members FLEEING around them pay no attention. This great epic combat, this tremendous blood feud, has been reduced to its essence: it is a street fight. But a street fight to the death.
WE WATCH Amsterdam and the Butcher struggle from street level, the fight often obscured by the legs and feet of the gang members RUSHING past. These two ancient antagonists could be anyone. Anyone at all.
The Butcher is atop Amsterdam now, iron hand? at his throat... as Amsterdam's hand rises, holding the pirate's knife...  searching for the strength ...  and the place...  for one final blow ...  the Butcher's fingers TIGHTEN ...  Amsterdam's hand moves ...  and the pirate's knife DRIVES HOME right into the Butcher's stomach: the belly of the beast.
The Butcher bellows. Amsterdam FLIPS him over, starts to SLIT him up the
front, but the knife cannot cut the pelvic bone. Amsterdam puts his knee on the Butcher's throat, PINNING HIM.
AMSTERDAM
Don't look away.
And he SLAPS his hand over the Butcher's one good eye, so he can't see the death blow, EXTRACTS the knife... and PLUNGES it like a stake into the Butcher's heart.
He takes his hand away. All the Butcher can see is Amsterdam's face as his EYE starts to roll back in his head at the approach of death.
BILL THE BUTCHER
Thank...  thank God I died a true American.
And he dies. There is no triumph in Amsterdam's face. Only pain, and satiation. He SEES: the CLEAVER, on the ground a few yards from him. And Jenny, staring at him. Amsterdam GESTURES for the cleaver.
JENNY
(quietly)
Get it yourself.
Amsterdam tries to get up. He can't. So he CRAWLS through the mud... 
for the cleaver. Grabs it.
DISSOLVE TO
EXT. CEMETERY DAY
The headstone of Priest Vallon. Now it has an inscription, which Amsterdam is finishing. He uses the handle of the Butcher's cleaver for a hammer, the blade of the piratels knife as a chisel. WE SEE the inscription: "Priest Vallon/ 1814-1844/ New York City...  of
153
The blade BREAKS on the final letter. Amsterdam sits back an the ground near the grave. Behind him across the river (MATTE), the fires of the riots still burn.
JENNY
You'll have to come back to finish.
AMSTERDAM
Maybe I'll leave it.
(beat)
Are you leaving?
JENNY
I'm going west.
AMSTERDAM
Well wherever you go, you got to go back through the city. so we're
going
the same way for a while.
He starts to STAND, STUMBLES to one knee.
AMSTERDAM
Help me, will you?
She looks at him...  a lingering moment ...  then goes to him.
JENNY
Give me your hand.
She HELPS him up, puts his arm over her shoulder...  and they start to walk away together through the graveyard toward the burning island beyond.
The CAMERA pulls back... . and as Amsterdam and Jenny WALK AWAY the
SKYLINE OF NEW YORK starts to take shape before us. TOWERS of steel and concrete start to rise.
As the SUN begins to descend, we see, in outline, the familiar contemporary SKYLINE of New York. As the SUN FALLS, the outline of the city becomes grander still, until, in the late afternoon light, it gives off an almost SPECTRAL GLOW... 
...  which SHINES for a last moment on the now-aged headstone of Priest Vallon, its inscription unfinished.
As, in the distance, the sun SETS an New York and the city grows still and black in the wash of impenetrable darkness.
THE END
