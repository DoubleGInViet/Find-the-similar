I appeal to you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship. Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect.
-Romans 12:1-2
EXT. SUBURBAN - NIGHT
ANDRE, 29, an African-American man walks down the sidewalk talking on his phone.
ANDRE
Hey. I’m trying to figure out what kind of sick individual would name a street Evergreen Way a half a mile from and “Evergreen Lane.”
CRYSTAL (O.S.)
Oh shit. You’re at Evergreen Lane?
ANDRE
Took me long enough to figure that shit out too. Now I’m walking through creepy confusing-ass suburbs.
They laugh
ANDRE (CONT’D)
I’m serious though. I’m out here
like a sore thumb and shit.
CRYSTAL (O.S.)
Stay put; we’ll come get you.
ANDRE
No, I’m like 10 minutes away now.
I’m good. I need a drink, but I’m
good.
CRYSTAL
Okay. Sorry baby. I’ll make it up
to you.
ANDRE
I’m gonna hold you to that, too.
See you in a minute.
Andre hangs up.
2.
Andre stops. He looks down the street behind him. It’s dark and empty. Andre looks up the street in front of him; A vintage creme-colored Porsche with tinted windows and a roof passes him.
A dog barks.
The car does a u-turn behind him. It now CREEPS up on the street behind Andre. It’s following him.
INT. SPORTS CAR - CONTINUOUS
Drivers’s POV watching Andre. His BREATH ECHOES deep and tinny as if were into a coffee can. Through the car’s system we hear the song “Run Rabbit Run.”
EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - CONTINUOUS
Andre, feeling followed, stops and turns. The car stops. He waves at the unseen DRIVER obscured by reflection of the streetlight on the windshield. There is no response. The ENGINE PURRS. The song “Run Rabbit Run” is playing from inside.
Andre peers through the windshield but can’t see through the reflection of the street lamp.
Nothing. Sketchy. Andre resumes walking; the car follows suit... 
ANDRE
(under his breath)
This is some shit right here... 
After a beat of walking.
ANDRE (CONT’D)
Nope.
Andre turns around and begins walking in the other direction.
ANDRE (CONT’D)
(to himself)
Yo.
INT. SPORTS CAR - CONTINUOUS
Driver’s POV. Andre walks.
3.
EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - CONTINUOUS
Andre hears the song “Run Rabbit Run” more clearly now. Andre turns back to the car it’s sitting in the street where he left it. He walks into the street and peers to get a better angle. The driver’s side car door is open.
ANDRE
What the fuck?
Andre turns back to the curb and the DRIVER, in a black knight’s helmet, steps towards him and quickly wraps him up in a rear naked choke hold. Andre struggles but soon passes out. The phone drops to the floor. HE is dragged to the trunk of the car.
The driver plops Andre in the padded trunk. He gets in his car and drives off.
TITLE CARD:
“Get Out”

EXT. CITY- DAWN
The sun rises over the city. Autumn. Beautiful.
INT. CITY APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - MORNING
We move slowly through the small but clean apartment. The walls are decorated with striking urban photography. A SHOWER RUNS.
INT. CITY APARTMENT - BATHROOM - MORNING
CHRIS WASHINGTON, 24, a handsome African-American man shuts the medicine cabinet. He’s shirtless and naturally athletic. He scrutinizes his reflection with a touch of vanity.
INT. CITY APARTMENT - BATHROOM - MORNING
Chris spreads shaving cream onto his face and shaves. He postures a little then nicks himself on the neck. He smirks; deserved that.
INT. CITY APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - MORNING
Chris, clothed, looks out his window through a professional camera. He flips through some striking urban images on the digital display much like the ones framed around his apartment. He is a very talented photographer.
Sid, a small dog, watches him. The BUZZER RINGS.
INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - ELEVATOR
Rose rides in the elevator. The doors open.
INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - MORNING
Rose walks down the hallway with her hands full. She has two coffees and two bags of pastries. Chris opens the door. Rose stands outside the apartment. Chris smirks.
ROSE
I know. I couldn’t decide... 
He takes the coffee tray and pulls her inside. They kiss and shut the door.
5.
INT. CITY APARTMENT - CHRIS’ BEDROOM - DAY
Chris packs a small bag of luggage. Rose lays on the bed.
Rose eats a chocolate croissant. SID lays by her on the bed.
She strokes him. It’s a perfect morning.
ROSE
Toothbrush...  Deodorant... 
CHRIS
Check...  Check... .
Rose notices Chris is being cagey.
Chris packs in silence for a moment.
ROSE
What? Where’d you go?
CHRIS
Nowhere.
ROSE
No, what?
CHRIS
Do the know I’m black?
ROSE
No. Why? Should they?
CHRIS
Seems like you might wanna mention it... 
ROSE
Right. You mean like “Mom, Dad, my black boyfriend and I are coming up for the weekend”? He’s African American, but I hope you can overlook that.
Chris, being teased, pulls Rose by the ankle and gets on top of her.
CHRIS
You said I’m the first black guy
you’d ever dated.
6.
ROSE
Yeah, so.
CHRIS
I’m just sayin’ this is uncharted territory for them. I don’t wanna get chased off the lawn with a gun.
Rose embraces him and pulls him to the bed.
ROSE
Dude, seriously. My dad would’ve legit voted for Obama a third time if he could’ve. Yes, he will want to talk to you about it, and that will be embarrassing as fuck, but it’s just cause he’s lame.
Chris laughs.
ROSE (CONT’D)
There are a lot of maddening things about them but they’re not racist. I promise.
Chris nods amused, but isn’t totally convinced.
ROSE (CONT’D)
And my mom loves Idris Elba.
CHRIS
(sarcastic)
Oh, why didn’t you say so?
He holds her. He kisses her cheek. She raises her phone and takes a selfie of them.
CHRIS (CONT’D)
Oh, sneak attack!
ROSE
(laughing)
Don’t!
They roll around playfully.
INT. CITY APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY
Chris and Rose stand by the front door about to leave. Rose blows Sid a kiss.
7.
ROSE
(to Sid)
Bye, Sid.
They almost leave, but at the last second goes to turn the TV on for Sid. He rubs Sid’s head briefly.
CHRIS
(to Sid)
Rod’ll be by soon. Love you.
They leave. Sid watches a commercial for the United Negro College Fund.
COMMERCIAL (V.O.)
The United Negro College Fund. A mind is a terrible thing to waste.
EXT. RURAL ROAD - BIRD’S-EYE VIEW - DAY
We soar over Rose’s Car as it drives through the beautiful countryside; a road flanked by woods.
INT. ROSE’S CAR - DAY
Rose hums. Chris, in the passengers seat, looks through his camera at the passing trees. He snaps a test shot. Chris picks up a fast food wrapper from the floor of the car and tosses it in the backseat.
CHRIS
I can’t believe they even let you
in a Hospital.
ROSE
I’m very sanitary at work.
CHRIS
How long has it been?
ROSE
Since I’ve been up here? I don’t
know. A few years? My dad grew up
here. We used to come up every
summer to visit my grandparents.
Since they died, my parents
basically moved here.
Chris takes out a cigarette sneakily. Rose grabs it promptly. Chris holds out his hand for it. He’s played this game before.
8.
CHRIS
Okay.
She poses sexy with it.
ROSE
Is this hot? Do I look hot?
CHRIS
I’m a grown man. If I say I want a cigarette, I should be able to--
She opens the window and throws it out and closes the window.
CHRIS (CONT’D)
Okay, so that’s like a dollar. You basically just threw a dollar out the window.
Rose takes a crumpled dollar out of her purse.
CHRIS (CONT’D)
Hold on, I gotta call Rod.
Chris takes out his phone.
EXT. AIRPORT - DEPARTURES TERMINAL - DAY
ROD WILLIAMS, 26, African American, a stocky TSA agent smokes a cigarette and hides it from arriving passengers. His cell phone rings.
ROD
Sup?
INTERCUT WITH:
NT. ROSE’S CAR - DAY
Chris sits in the passenger seat and talks on the cell phone.
CHRIS
Hey, You at work?
ROD
Yeah. Chris, tell me this. How I’m gonna get in trouble for pattin’ down an old lady. It’s standard procedure!I got fuckin’ Gary out here thinkin’ just because a bitch elderly, she can’t hijack an airplane.
9.
Chris laughs.
ROD (CONT’D)
Watch, the next 9/11 is gonna be on some geriatric shit too.
CHRIS
Look, man; Thanks for watching Sid this weekend. Remember, no human food; he’s got IBS.
ROD
You actually think I forgot that shit? Damn ‘C’, I’m hurt. Give your boy a little credit. I don’t forget shit, you do.
CHRIS
Yeah, yeah. Alright.
ROD
Apology accepted. How’s ‘Lil Miss
Rosie?
CHRIS
She’s good. She’s drivin’--
Rose holds out her hand. Chris reluctantly turns on the speaker phone.
ROSE
Hi, Rod.
ROD
Whattup girl? Hey listen, you
better bring my boy back in one
piece.
ROSE
I don’t even know what that means
but yes, I promise.
ROD
You know you picked the wrong guy
though right?
ROSE
It’s not too late for us is it?
Chris turns the speaker phone back off.
CHRIS
Okay, get your own girl.
10.
ROD
Damn, I never seen you like this.
CHRIS
Like what?
ROD
Meeting the family? What does she
lick your balls or something?
CHRIS
Goodbye, Rod. I’ll kick you some
cash when I get back.
ROD
I don’t need your money, just get your girl to introduce me to one of her ball-lickin’ girlfriends, and we’re straight.
CHRIS
Bye.
ROD
You better not come back all bougie on me--
Chris hangs up. He gives Rose a look.
ROSE
What..? Settle down. You know I’m
yours.
Rose pokes Chris. He’s clearly very ticklish.
CHRIS
Hey!
After a brief standoff they begin a tickle fight.
ROSE
Stop! I’m driving.
Chris pulls away. After a moment... 
CHRIS
You started it--
A shadow darts across the hood of the car. It’s hind legs SMACK the hood of the car with a loud THWAT-THWAT!
11.
EXT. RURAL ROAD. CONTINUOUS
The deer is propelled into the woods like a pinwheel. The car screeches to a halt. The passenger’s side mirror swings dangling off it’s mount. Chris and Rose breathe hard for a few moments of shock.
ROSE
Fuck!
CHRIS
You okay?
ROSE
Yeah. You?
CHRIS
Yeah. That scared the shit out of
me.
Rose and Chris get out of the car and inspect the damage. The right headlight is busted and a scratch in the paint leads across the hood to the right rearview mirror which hangs
ROSE
Fuck!!!
Chris looks back in the direction of the collision.
CHRIS
Stay here.
ROSE
What are you doing?
CHRIS
I don’t know...  See if it’s okay?
Chris walks a few more steps then stops. He rethinks.
CHRIS (CONT’D)
Maybe it’s gone--
A guttural, almost human, moan OF PAIN comes from in the trees behind them. They watch the woods in horror.
Chris walks back towards the haunting wail. It stops.
ROSE
Chris... ?
12.
Chris motions for Rose to stay. He keeps walking towards the thicket about 40 Ft behind the car. Something breathes deep in the bushes.
ROSE (CONT’D)
Be careful!
Chris gathers his courage and steps off the road into the dark thicket. He peers through the bushes. The deer lays there gasping for air and watching him with a black wet eye. Chris is transfixed.
EXT. RURAL ROAD - DAY
A cop car is now pulled up behind Rose’s car. OFFICER FROSTY - Caucasian - 33 stands near the deer on the road behind. Another officer, OFFICER RYAN - 40 - Caucasian, speaks with Rose who stands by the open driver’s side door. Chris sits lightly on the hood facing forward lost in thought.
INT. ROSE’S CAR - CONTINUOUS
Rose rummages through her messy purse.
OFFICER RYAN
So, in the future the number to
call is Animal Control Services.
ROSE
Right. Thanks. Here it is!
Rose finally pulls her driver’s license from her purse. The Officer looks at it and over at Chris.
OFFICER RYAN
You two coming up from the city?
ROSE
Yeah. My parents live in the Lake Pontaco area. We’re up here for the weekend.
OFFICER RYAN
Sir..? Can I see your license?
CHRIS
Oh...  yeah. I have a state I.D.
ROSE
Wait, why?
13.
OFFICER RYAN
Ma’am?
ROSE
He wasn’t driving?
OFFICER RYAN
I didn’t ask if he was driving, I
asked to see his I.D.
ROSE
(to Officer Ryan)
But why? It doesn’t make any sense.
CHRIS
Here.
Chris offers Officer Ryan his I.D.
ROSE
No, fuck that. He shouldn’t have to show you his I.D. because he hasn’t done anything wrong.
CHRIS
Baby. It’s okay--
OFFICER RYAN
Ma’am, any time there is an
incident we have the right to--
ROSE
That’s bullshit!
OFFICER RYAN
Ma’am... 
There is a tense silence. Officer Ryan gives up. Not worth the trouble. Officer Ryan’s walkie chimes in.
OFFICER FROSTY
Everything alright up there
Crowsie?
He presses his walkie button.
OFFICER RYAN
Yeah, I’m all good.
(to Chris and Rose)
You guys drive safe.
Rose and Chris get into their car.
14.
OFFICER RYAN (CONT’D) Get that headlight fixed...  And the mirror.
EXT. RURAL ROAD - DAY
Bird’s eye view. The car winds through a thickly wooded road.
INT. ROSE’S CAR - AFTERNOON
Chris sits in the passenger’s seat deep in thought. He watches Rose with a new pride. Rose notices.
ROSE
What?
CHRIS
That was hot.
ROSE
I’m not gonna let anyone mess with my man.
CHRIS
I see that.
ROSE
We’re here.
EXT. ARMITAGE ESTATE - AFTERNOON
The woods give way to an huge clearing. A lovely medium-sized home sits in the middle. Thick forest surrounds the estate. The property is charming and isolated; no other houses in sight.
As they drive past the large front lawn passing WALTER, African American 35, who trims hedges. Walter is tall and wears a gardening hat. He works slowly and methodically. Rose waves as they pass.
ROSE
Hi, Walter!
Walter waves back.
ROSE (CONT’D)
(to Chris)
The grounds-keeper.
15.
CHRIS
Oh, okay.
EXT. ARMITAGE ESTATE - MOMENTS LATER
Having parked, Rose and Chris approach the front door with their luggage. Rose rummages through her bag.
ROSE
Where are my stupid keys... ? I just had them in my hand.
Chris RINGS the DOORBELL. Touché.
ROSE (CONT’D)
Get ready.
FOOTSTEPS. The door swings open revealing... 
DEAN ARMITAGE, 59, a tall, barrel-chested WASP. Dean is a well educated man with a poor social filter and a bad case of Dad humor. He is the kind of guy who pronounces garbage, Gar-bahge.
And...  MISSY ARMITAGE, 56, is poised, warm and beautiful. She exudes patience and intelligence. Missy can read people like books. She’s a perfectly attentive host.
Rose hugs her parents.
Hi!	ROSE (CONT’D)
DEAN	MISSY
There she is!	Hello sweetheart.
Chris stands there awkwardly.
ROSE
Chris, this my Mom and my Dad. Mom,
Dad; Chris.
CHRIS
Hey.
Dean holds his hand out.
DEAN
You can call me Mr. Armitage.
CHRIS
Of course. I--
16.
DEAN
Got him. Come here.
Dean grabs Chris’ hand and pulls him in for a bear hug.
DEAN (CONT’D)
We hug around here, my Man. Call me
Dean.
Rose rolls her eyes with love. She’s already embarrassed.
MISSY
(to Rose)
Your father’s very excited.
CHRIS
Nice to meet you.
MISSY
Hi, I’m Missy, welcome to our home.
Missy shakes Chris’ hand warmly.
MISSY (CONT’D)
Come inside.
DEAN
Yes, Come in! Make yourselves
comfortable?
The four enter the house. Walter watches from afar. He slowly turns and goes back to work.
INT. ARMITAGE HOME - FOYER - CONTINUOUS
The interior is homey and eccentric; worldly and interesting.
DEAN
(to Rose and Chris)
How was the ride in?
ROSE
We hit a deer.
DEAN
Oh no! Is it dead?
CHRIS
Yeah.
MISSY
That’s horrible. Are you guys
alright?
ROSE
Yeah. It just fruck us out.
17.
MISSY
“Fruck?” That’s a good one.
CHRIS
It came out of nowhere. We got it
pretty good.
DEAN
You know what I say: One down...  a few hundred thousand to go.
MISSY
ROSE
(laughing)
Dad.
Dean. So awful.
DEAN
What?! They’re everywhere; like
rats. The threat they pose to the
ecology is pretty serious stuff.
MISSY
I’m sure that was traumatic for
you. You two must be exhausted.
CHRIS
Yeah, a little.
DEAN
So how long have you guys been a
thing?
CHRIS
4 months.
ROSE
5 months.
CHRIS
She’s right, I’m wrong.
DEAN
‘Atta boy, Chris. Get used to
saying that.
Dean stands.
DEAN (CONT’D)
Anyway, let me give you the grand
tour.
ROSE
Slow down. We just got here.
18.
MISSY
Let them unload their bags first.
DEAN
Yeah, yeah. Alright. Well, hurry.
INT. ARMITAGE UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY
Rose and Chris take their bags upstairs.
INT. ARMITAGE HOUSE - ROSE’S BEDROOM - DAY
Rose’s old room is a cross between a young-minded teenage girl...  (a stuffed lion, ballerina music box etc) and a moodier more rebellious teen. A window overlooks the front lawn.
Rose and Chris place their bags down. She starts unpacking.
ROSE
I was never this clean.
CHRIS
Oh, right.
Chris looks at some pictures posted on her dresser.
ROSE
So... 
CHRIS
What? Oh, they’re great.
ROSE
I told you.
He sees a picture of Rose in high school on stage in a production of ‘The Crucible.'
CHRIS
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Is this
you?
ROSE
Where did you find that. I hate
that picture.
Rose takes it from him and puts it in the closet.
CHRIS
I didn’t know you were a drama kid.
19.
ROSE
There’s a lot you don’t know about me.
CHRIS
Oh really?
Rose grabs Chris by the belt and pulls him to the bed on top of her. They kiss. She goes for his fly.
CHRIS (CONT’D)
Wait, what about the tour?
Rose looks at him like “You’ve got to be kidding me.” Chris laughs.
CHRIS (CONT’D)
What? I want to be respectful.
INT. ARMITAGE DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY
Dean and Chris walk and look at pictures on the wall. Rose in the living room.
Dean opens the door to the office. He and Chris stand outside the door as Dean reaches in to turn on the lights. In front of the desk, two comfortable-looking chairs face each other. Books line the walls. Dean and Chris don’t enter.
DEAN
Missy’s office.	She takes
appointments in there.
CHRIS
Nice. She’s a therapist, right?
DEAN
Psychiatrist, yeah. Turns out
people up here are just as messed
up in the head as they were in the
city.
Chris zones in on a photograph taken in the 90’s in front of the Armitage house. Dean and Missy are younger, and Rose and her brother Jeremy are kids. Roman and Josie Armitage, the grandparents stand in the middle.
DEAN (CONT’D)
That’s my Son Jeremy.
CHRIS
I’ve heard stories.
20.
DEAN
He went through a couple dark spots but came out the other side just fine. He’s in Med school like his pops. You’ll meet him later.
CHRIS
Oh, cool.
They pass Rose who’s on her phone in the living room. She gives him an “Told you this would be boring” look.
DEAN
(chuckles)
We pop around quite a bit; always
seem to bring some new little
treasure back from wherever.
They move down the hallway to a black and white framed picture of a 25 year old man posing in the starting position for a race.
DEAN (CONT’D)
Oh you’ll like this. My dad’s claim to fame. He was beat out by Jessie Owens in the qualifying round for the Berlin Olympics in ‘36. That’s the one where--
CHRIS
--Owens won in front of Hitler.
DEAN
Talk about a perfect moment in history. There’s Hitler on his high horse with his perfect Aryan race, and here comes this black fella to prove him wrong in front of the world. What a moment.
CHRIS
Tough break for your Dad though.
DEAN
He almost got over it.
Dean winks.
INT. ARMITAGE HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY
Dean and Chris continue their walk-through. The kitchen is homey and pristine. It has a distinctly grandmotherly vibe.
21.
GEORGINA (30), African American, stands in the middle of the kitchen cleaning the center island and smiling like she’s been waiting for them.
DEAN
My mother loved her kitchen, so we kept a piece of her in here.
CHRIS
(to Georgina)
Hi
DEAN
Oh, Georgina, this is Chris; Rose’s boyfriend.
GEORGINA
Hello.-
DEAN
“Garbahge” goes under the sink. But now for the piece de resistance... 
Dean opens the glass back door.
EXT. BACKYARD - LATE AFTERNOON
The yard is huge and the woods beyond it ominous. The wind RUSHES through the trees. Dean leads Chris out through the yard towards a gazebo.
DEAN
Smell that... ? Space! I love it. I’m tellin’ you, the nearest house is practically on the other side of the lake. It’s total privacy out here.
Chris is distracted by Walter who prepares the lawn mower in the distance.
DEAN (CONT’D)
I know what you’re thinking.
Chris looks at him.
DEAN (CONT’D)
White family; black servants. Total cliche.
CHRIS
I wasn’t gonna go there.
22.
DEAN
You didn’t have to. Trust me, I know. We hired them a few years ago to help care for my parents; they’re like part of the family now. Couldn’t bear to let them go. I hate the way it looks though... 
CHRIS
Yeah, I know what you mean.
DEAN
And by the way, I would’ve voted
for Obama a third term if I
could’ve. Best president in my
lifetime. Hands down.
Chris smirks.
CHRIS
I agree.
EXT. OUTDOOR PATIO - DAY
Dean, Missy, Chris and Rose sit with iced teas. Missy stirs sugar into hers. Walter mows in the distance. Dean views pictures on Chris’ camera.
DEAN
Wow. Look at that. Isn’t that
something?
He shows Missy a particularly cool photo.
MISSY
Gorgeous. Just gorgeous.
DEAN
I love this one.
ROSE
Which one?
Dean turns the camera around and it’s a beautiful picture of Rose.
CHRIS
That was taken the day we met.
ROSE
I was volunteering at the blood
drive.
23.
MISSY
How long ago was that?
DEAN
So... ? Are you guys in love or
what?
ROSE
Really, Dad..?
CHRIS
We’ve been trying to take it slow
but... 
Chris blushes. He looks at Rose. Rose can’t help but smile.
MISSY
Wouldn’t that be wonderful.
DEAN
(to Chris)
And what do your parents do?
CHRIS
My Dad was never really in the picture. My mom passed away when I was 11...  Hit and run.
MISSY
How did she die?
CHRIS
Hit and Run.
MISSY
Oh, that’s awful.
DEAN
Sorry to hear that.
DEAN (CONT’D)
So young too.
CHRIS
--Actually I don’t remember a whole lot from that time.
MISSY
It’s okay. We don’t need to talk
about that.
Missy stirs her glass. The spoon hits the side of the glass creating a small... 
TING TING TING TING
24.
Chris and Missy share a comforting look. They have an unspoken connection.
Chris scratches the table nervously. Missy notices.
DEAN
You smoke Chris?
CHRIS
I’m quitting.
ROSE
This is why I stopped bringing guys around.
MISSY
It’s okay, I’m not judging.
DEAN
Ugly habit though. You should have
Missy take care of that for you.
CHRIS
How?
DEAN
Hypnosis. She’s developed her own
system. It works like a charm.
CHRIS
Oh. Wow. Um... 
ROSE
Believe it or not, some people
don’t want strangers all up in
their heads.
DEAN
I thought the whole thing was bull shit too. I smoked for 15 years. She puts me under once, now the sight one makes me wanna vomit.
MISSY
Fall back, Dean.
CHRIS
I’m good, actually. Thank you
though.
25.
MISSY
Of course. I’m available for the
next two days if you change your
mind... 
Georgina brings the pitcher of iced tea around and refills everyone’s glass. She smiles and avoids eye contact.
DEAN
Smoker or not, we’re just glad you could join us for the big get-together.
ROSE
Oh shit. That’s this weekend?
CHRIS
What’s the get-together?
MISSY
Rose’s grandfather’s party.
DEAN
My Dad threw a shindig for his
friends once a year. Bocce ball,
horseshoes, badminton.
ROSE
It’s basically a bunch of rich old people playing lawn games. Why didn’t you tell me?
MISSY
It’s the same day every year
sweetheart.
(To Chris)
We kept it going after they died.
Makes us feel like they’re here
with us.
Georgina’s expression glazes over. Her head cocks a little, and subtle flashes of fear cross her face. No one notices.
ROSE
I just wanted to bring him up on a chill weekend.
CHRIS
Sounds like fun, actually.
Georgina has been pouring Chris’ drink too long and his glass has overflown.
26.
MISSY
(concerned)
Georgina.
Georgina snaps out of her daze and starts to clean.
GEORGINA
I’m sorry. Look what I’ve done.
What a nincompoop.
MISSY
It’s fine, George. Just leave it.
GEORGINA
Oh, I can’t leave that there.
MISSY
--Yes you can. Why don’t you go lie down.
GEORGINA
I think I will.
Georgina nods, smiles and walks away. Chris and Rose look at Dean. That was odd. Dean shrugs.
JEREMY (O.S.)
What’s up, FAM?!?
MISSY
Jeremy’s home.
JEREMY, 29, rounds the house with open arms. He’s “Rich kid intense”; handsome with an unpredictable wildness behind his eyes.
JEREMY
Who answers the door around here?!
INT. ARMITAGE DINING ROOM - LATER/NIGHT
Everyone but Rose laughs. She holds her face in embarrassment.
Dean pours the remainder of a bottle of wine into Chris’ glass. Their meal is done and they are tipsy.
ROSE
Okay, enough.
JEREMY
“Enough?” We’re just getting
started. Let’s see. What else?
(MORE)
27.
JEREMY (CONT'D)
What else? Did she tell you about
her toenail collection?
ROSE
Oh my God!!!
CHRIS
What?
JEREMY
She’d bite em off with her teeth
and suck on them and save them in
her jewelry box.
ROSE
No I didn’t.
JEREMY
Yes you did, liar.
Rose throws her napkin at Jeremy as he pops the cork on a new bottle. Dean and Missy try not to laugh.
CHRIS
That’s really disgusting.
ROSE
(to Jeremy)
I hate you so much.
JEREMY
(to Rose)
Love you too.
(to Chris)
Oh, okay. Here’s a good one. Let me set the scene. It was our junior year and Rose has a crush on this guy Conner Garfield.
ROSE
--No. Mom.
MISSY
Jeremy... 
CHRIS
No, no...  These are good. I wanna
hear this.
DEAN
Manners, Rose. Give the guest what he wants.
He winks at Rose warmly.
28.
JEREMY
SO, Conner’s from my lacrosse team. Huge kid, like 6’3”, and pretty dumb, right? We threw a party--
ROSE
You threw a party.
JEREMY
--I think my parents were in Greece or something. We raided their liquor cabinet and we’re all shit-faced. Like 15 of us.
MISSY
Ha! No you weren’t. Were you?
JEREMY
We put water in the bottles so you wouldn’t know. Let me finish. So I’m upstairs in my parents’ bathroom hooking up with Jean Deely, hottest girl in our class.
MISSY
Ugh.
ROSE
You realize you’re coming off like a douche right now, right?
JEREMY
Thanks. All of a sudden Connor starts banging on the bathroom door, right? I open it, and he’s got blood gushing out of his mouth and he’s screaming “Your thith-ter bit my fuckin’ thongue off!!!!”
CHRIS
Whoa, what?
JEREMY
Sure enough, there is a centimeter of tongue meat missing right here.
Jeremy demonstrates and Chris winces.
CHRIS
(to Rose)
Ahhhh! You bit him?
29.
ROSE
He cornered me and shoved his
tongue in my mouth, so yeah.
CHRIS
That’s badass.
DEAN
I never heard about that.
JEREMY
I made him clean up the blood.
Jeremy locks into Chris, intensely.
MISSY
Well, I’m going to see how dessert is coming along.
(To Dean)
Maybe we can change the conversation to something a little lighter.
Missy walks out of the dining room into the kitchen. The door swings open and Chris gets a glimpse of Georgina who stands in a daze looking at the ceiling. The door swings shut.
DEAN
Chris, what’s your sport?
Football... ? Baseball?
CHRIS
Ah, Basketball, I guess. I don’t
know; not really into sports
though.
JEREMY
You an MMA fan?
ROSE
Dude.
JEREMY
What?
DEAN
She’s right. Let someone else talk for a bit.
30.
JEREMY
He’s dating my sister! You’ve had your chance; I can’t bond with the guy?
Dean exhales.
CHRIS
You mean like UFC? Yeah, nah. Too
brutal for me.
JEREMY
You ever get into street fights as a kid?
CHRIS
Not really. I did take Judo for
after-school in 1st grade.
ROSE
Awww.
JEREMY
Cause, with your frame, your
genetic make-up?	If you pushed
your body, I mean really trained,
you’d be a fucking beast.
The kitchen door swings open again, and Missy walks back in with a perfect carrot cake. Georgina is gone.
MISSY
What’d I miss?
ROSE
A lot of nothing.
JEREMY
We’re talking about sports.
(to Chris)
See the thing about jiu-jitsu, is
that strength doesn’t matter. All
that matters is this.
Jeremy points to his head and stares Chris down.
JEREMY (CONT’D)
It’s a strategic game like chess.
It’s all about being two, three,
even four moves ahead.
CHRIS
Cool.
31.
JEREMY
Stand up. Let me show you
something.
MISSY
No karate at the dinner table.
JEREMY
It’s not karate.
He stumbles a little towards Chris and tries to put him in a headlock. Chris stands.
CHRIS
I’ve got a rule. I don’t play-fight with drunk dudes.
JEREMY
I’m just--
DEAN
--Alright enough, Jeremy.
Dean is loud and stern for the first time. Jeremy’s eyes flutter, DRUNK and embarrassed.
JEREMY
I wasn’t going to hurt him.
He grabs a wine bottle and goes upstairs... 
DEAN
Well...  one more bottle?
EXT. THE ESTATE. NIGHT
Full moon. CRICKETS.
INT. ROSE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Chris lays in Rose’s bed looking at Rose’s computer. Rose brushes her teeth in the bathroom. She says something unintelligible.
ROSE
I mean, he was going to put you in a headlock? What the fuck! He’s never talked to any of my boyfriends like that.
CHRIS
Mmm hmm.
32.
Chris smiles.
ROSE
And my Dad! He must’ve called you “My man” eight times today. Eight.
CHRIS
Yep.
ROSE
Even my Mom is like borderline rude to Georgina, right? Chris, what the fuck?!?
Chris bites his tongue.
ROSE (CONT’D)
Well?
CHRIS
I told you so.
Rose pouts.
CHRIS (CONT’D)
I wasn’t going to say it.
ROSE
Chris.
CHRIS
Come here.
Rose comes to him.
ROSE
How are you so calm?
CHRIS
Honestly. It could be so much
worse. At least they’re trying.
ROSE
They are. They love you.
CHRIS
I can tell. At the end of the day, that’s more than can be said for a lot of people.
He pulls her on top of him.
33.
CHRIS (CONT’D)
I like you on your racial flow tho.
They kiss.
ROSE
I’m worried about tomorrow. The
party? What if it gets worse?
CHRIS
I’m good. How bad could it be?
Chris pulls her on top of him and she kisses him.
CHRIS (CONT’D)
You’re minty.
They kiss again.
CHRIS (CONT’D)
You know, with my genetic makeup... 
They wrestle and she pulls off her shirt.
EXT. ARMITAGE ESTATE - NIGHT
All the lights are off in the house. Crickets chirp.
INT. ROSE’S BEDROOM - LATER
Rose sleeps, but Chris is wide awake. There’s a buzz in his ear. He smacks his own head and sits up. A stuffed lion seems to watch Chris from atop her dresser. He turns it away. A soft HOWL of WIND rushes through the room. The CLOSET DOOR CREEKS open.
Chris’ eyes drift to the pack of cigarettes sticking out of his camera bag pocket draped on the desk chair.
INT. ARMITAGE HOME - NIGHT
Chris leaves Rose’s room and walks down the dark hallway. A floorboard creaks under his feet. He turns down the stairs.
INT. ARMITAGE DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
Chris gets to the bottom of the stairs. Chris continues to walk down the hallway past the pictures towards the kitchen.
34.
INT. ARMITAGE KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
Chris walks through the kitchen and continues out back door of the house.
EXT. BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS
Chris steps out the back door and takes a cigarette out. Chris looks into the vast night around him. The CRICKETS are deafening.
Suddenly, Chris hears a RUNNING NOISE in the distance. Chris peers out into the darkness. A moment of terror comes over Chris. He makes out a shape. It’s now running towards him. Chris backs up in fear. It gets closer and closer. When it’s just 10 feet away, the moonlight reveals a now very close Walter, the grounds keeper who continues running by. Chris gathers his breath.
Chris turns back towards the kitchen window lights up from inside. He finds himself face to face with Georgina who, with teeth exposed in a frightening grimace, glares through the window dead in Chris’ eyes. He drops his cigarette. Caught.
INT. ARMITAGE LAUNDRY ROOM - NIGHT
Georgina sucks her teeth. She doesn’t actually see Chris at all. She examines her teeth in the reflection in the window which, front lit, reflects her and the room around her. Outside is invisible.
EXT. BACKYARD - NIGHT
Chris realizes he’s not caught. Close call. Inside Georgina begins to do laundry. Chris quietly sneaks around the house.
INT. ARMITAGE HALLWAY - NIGHT
Chris sneaks in through the door in the dark dining room. Chris moves down the hallway past Missy’s office. The desk lamp turns on. Missy sits inside drinking a cup of tea.
MISSY
Do you know how dangerous smoking
is, Chris?
Chris is startled; caught; for real this time.
35.
CHRIS
Yeah. Yeah I do.
MISSY
You alright?
CHRIS
Yeah, why?
MISSY
You seem a little jumpy, nervous.
CHRIS
I’m not nervous. That dude Walter
running out there scared me. And
Georg--
Georgina comes by with a teapot.
GEORGINA
Can I get you a cup.
CHRIS
Nah, I’m good. It’ll keep me up.
MISSY
Come in.
Chris comes in.
INT. MISSY’S OFFICE - NIGHT
Georgina Missy and Chris sit across from each other. Georgina pouring tea pot.
MISSY
I’ve got it Georgina.
GEORGINA
Of course.
Georgina leaves. Missy starts stirring sugar into her tea.
MISSY
They’re both obsessive
compulsive...  They get up too
early.
CHRIS
What about you?
36.
MISSY
I just can’t sleep.
CHRIS
Me neither.
MISSY
Is it the bed?
CHRIS
Nah, the bed’s fine.
MISSY
Comfortable enough?
CHRIS
It’s perfect, thanks.
MISSY
Enough sheets?
CHRIS
Yep.
Chris’ scratches the chair. Missy notices.
MISSY
Wanna know how it works?
Missy puts two sugar cubes in her cup. She begins to stir slowly, CLINKING the SPOON softly and rhythmically against the sides of the cup.
TinG TINg.	TinG tinG.
CHRIS
What, do you swing a pocket watch
in front of people’s faces?
MISSY
You watch a lot of Television. Now, you are feeling very sleeepy... 
TinG tinG.	TinG tinG.
They share a smile.
MISSY (CONT’D)
We do use focal points sometimes, but just about any object or simple motion can guide someone to a state of heightened suggestibility.
37.
CHRIS
Heightened suggestibility.
MISSY
That’s right. Why do you wanna try?
CHRIS
Nope. Definitely not for me.
MISSY
I understand. Now do you smoke in
front of Rose?
CHRIS
Huh.
TING TING. TING TING.
MISSY
Yeah, she’s my kid... 
CHRIS
Yeah, I’m gonna quit.
MISSY
What was your relationship with
your mother like?
CHRIS
Um I don’t. Wait, are you?
MISSY
Tell me, it’s alright. What was you relationship with your mother like?
CHRIS
Yeah...  She worked all the time.
She was funny. She loved me.
MISSY
Where were you when she died?
