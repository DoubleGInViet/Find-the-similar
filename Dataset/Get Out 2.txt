TING TING TING TING
CHRIS
I don’t wanna think about that.
MISSY
The mind goes where it wants to.
CHRIS
Home; watching TV.
38.
MISSY
And what do you hear?
CHRIS
Rain.
MISSY
It’s been raining a while.
CHRIS
Yes.
MISSY
Hear that. Hear the rain. What does it sound like? Hear it, Hear it...  Find it...  Tell me when you find
it.
The sound of RAIN AGAINST a WINDOW slowly fades up along with the MUFFLED sound of a SITCOM ON TELEVISION.
CHRIS
Okay...  Yeah, I found it.
TING TING.	TING TING.
MISSY
How old were you?
CHRIS
Eleven.
MISSY
Good. You’re eleven. Now touch. Feel your surroundings. Feel every part of your body and what you touched. Feel it. Find it...  Tell me when you find it... 
FLASHBACK - INT. SMALL APARTMENT - NIGHT
Close on 11 year old Chris’ hands scratches the bed post nervously.
MISSY (V.O.)
Tell me when you find it.
CHRIS (V.O.)
I found it.
His toes brush the carpet as his dangling legs swing off the 57 side of his bed.
39.
TING TING.	TING TING.
PRESENT DAY - INT. MISSY’S OFFICE. - NIGHT
Chris’ feet try to swing but are too long. He scratches the arm of the chair in Missy’s office.
MISSY
Are you alone?
CHRIS
Yes.
MISSY
Where’s your mom?
CHRIS
She’s late.
MISSY
Well, where is she?
CHRIS
Something’s wrong. She’s still not home.
MISSY
What did you do?
CHRIS
Nothing.
MISSY
Nothing?
CHRIS
I just sat there.
MISSY
You didn’t call anyone?
CHRIS
No.
MISSY
Your Aunt?
CHRIS
No.
MISSY
Why not?
40.
CHRIS
I don’t know. I thought if I did,
it would make it real.
TING TING.	TING TING.
MISSY
Good. Do you see it? Do you see the phone?
Chris doesn’t answer.
MISSY (CONT’D)
You need to see it. See it. See it.
Find it.
Chris’ continues to scratch the armchair.
TING TING.	TING TING
FLASHBACK - INT. SMALL APARTMENT - NIGHT
11-year-old Chris scratches through the wood on his bed, splintering a piece of the wood off. He watches TV from his bed next to some action figures. Chris looks at a telephone.
MISSY	(V.O.)
Tell me when--
11-year-old Chris nods.
TING TING.	TING TING.
PRESENT DAY - INT. MISSY’S OFFICE. NIGHT
Chris nods and cries.
CHRIS
--I see it.
MISSY
You’re scared.
Chris nods.
MISSY (CONT’D)
(realizing)
You think it was your fault.
Chris nods.
Chris’ hand scratching the chair intensifies.
41.
CHRIS
I can’t move.
MISSY
You can’t move.
He nods.
MISSY (CONT’D)
That’s good. Now sink into the
floor.
CHRIS
Wait I--
MISSY
Sink.
TING TING... 
Chris’ hand has compulsively scratched open the arm of the chair. His hand stops. His mouth drops and eyes open, frozen.
FLASHBACK - INT. SMALL APARTMENT - NIGHT
... TING TING.
Suddenly, 11-year-old Chris falls through the bed and floor.
END FLASHBACK
INT. DARKNESS
Terror. Chris, 26 again, breathes fast but falls in slow motion though darkness as if through water
He flails towards a pitch black abyss. He’s illuminated by the fading blue flicker of a large downward facing TV-like screen. On it Missy sits speaking to him and clinking her teacup.
Missy’s voice is everywhere.
PRESENT DAY - INT. MISSY’S OFFICE. NIGHT
Chris’ body sits in his chair motionless. He can’t move. His eyes are wide open, staring straight at Missy.
42.
INT. DARKNESS
Chris continues to slowly fall backwards away from the screen. All of a sudden his body stops is the space. He turns upright. He’s frozen in stasis.
CHRIS
No! NO!!! I’m done! Bring me back!
Please!!!!
He looks up. He can still see the screen above but it is far away, like the mouth of a deep and expansive well.
CHRIS (CONT’D)
(whispering)
Bring me back. Bring me back. Bring me back. Bring me back. Bring me back. Bring me back. Bring me back.
INT. MISSY’S OFFICE. CONTINUOUS
Missy stands. She walks towards Chris’ motionless body and looks down at him through his own eyes.
INT. DARKNESS - CONTINUOUS
Chris looks up in the darkness. Missy comes towards him until her face is close to the screen.
CHRIS
Mrs. Armitage!!!
MISSY
Now you are in the Sunken Place.
Missy reaches towards the screen and shuts his eyelids. The abyss goes almost completely dark. Now he’s alone in the dark. He cries in terror.
INT. ROSE’S BEDROOM - DAWN
Chris wakes up with a start in Rose’s bed, sweaty and heaving. He’s alone and confused. Bad dream? Headache.
The shower runs inside Rose’s bathroom.	SHE hums.
DING DING, DING DING
He’s gotten a message. It’s a picture of Rod pretending to pour beer in Sid’s mouth. Chris smiles. The batteries are low. He plugs his phone in and puts it on the dresser.
43.
EXT. WOODS - DAWN
It’s Golden hour. Beautiful. Chris walks through the yard to the edge of the forest with his camera.
Chris keeps walking. He looks through a long-zoom lens into the wilderness. He sees a bird and snaps a picture.
EXT. BACKYARD - MORNING
He walks from the woods towards to the house. Georgina can be seen through an upstairs window knitting. Chris raises his camera. She stands and begins admiring herself in a mirror. She’s beautiful. She begins to remove her wig. Then as if aware she’s being watched, she turns towards him. Chris turns away, taking a picture in another direction. He glances back at the window. Georgina is gone.
Chris sees Walter working about 50 feet away in the yard. He walks towards Walter.
CHRIS
What’s up?
No response.
CHRIS (CONT’D)
They working you good out here,
huh?
WALTER
Nothing I don’t want to be doing.
Walter is different than we’d expect. He has a bold and assaulting energy. Like he’s concealing a deep loathing with over the top enthusiasm. Chilling. Chris is instantly taken aback.
CHRIS
Yeah...  I never really got to meet you actually, up close. I’m Chris.
WALTER
I know who you are. You’re Rose’s
friend.
CHRIS
Yeah. Her boyfriend actually.So,
where you from originally?
WALTER
She is lovely isn’t she?
44.
CHRIS
Rose? Yeah, she is... 
WALTER
One of a kind; top of the line. A
real doggone keeper.
CHRIS
Right.
WALTER
And did it work?
CHRIS
Did what work?
WALTER
You were in Mrs. Armitage’s office for quite some time.
CHRIS
I	don’t... 
Chris remembers.
CHRIS (CONT’D)
Oh, yeah. Actually, I guess I had
too much wine last night. I don’t
really remember much.
WALTER
Well, I should get back to work,
and mind my own business.
Chris turns and walks away. He takes out a cigarette and puts it in his mouth. He spits it out. Nasty.
INT. ROSE’S BEDROOM - DAY
Chris enters as Rose finishes blow drying her hair. He’s worked up.
ROSE
Hi. Where have you been?
CHRIS
Out. Taking pictures. Hey, I think your mom hypnotized me last night.
ROSE
Wait, what?
45.
CHRIS
(hazy)
Yeah, I must’ve gone out for some air and run into her. I can barely remember any of it, but now the thought of a cigarette makes me wanna throw up.
Rose tries to hide slight amusement.
ROSE
I’m sorry. I just can’t believe she did that.
CHRIS
I had some fucked up dreams.
ROSE
Of what?
CHRIS
I was in a hole or something. I
couldn’t move.
ROSE
That happened to me too. When I was a kid. She hypnotized me
once for stage fright, and I had
the craziest nightmares. It did
work though... 
CHRIS
Yeah. Yeah, it worked. Hey, what’s
Walter’s deal?
ROSE
What do mean?
WALTER
I just talked to him. Dude’s whole vibe was hostile.
ROSE
What do you mean?
CHRIS
I don’t know. Maybe he likes you.
Maybe he’s jealous or something?
ROSE
I’ve never gotten that...  But, if
you think I have a chance..
Chris looks at her.
46.
ROSE (CONT’D)
I’ll talk to my Dad about it.
CHRIS
No, no, no. Don’t talk to your Dad.
It’s fine. It’s fine.
ROSE
I like that you’re threatened by
him.
CHRIS
I’m not threatened.
Rose hears and looks. Out the window, A PROCESSION OF CARS DRIVES onto the front yard. Chris looks as well.
ROSE
Okay. Here we go; It begins... 
EXT. BACKYARD - NOON
The party is in full swing. The 30 or so guests mingle excitedly. They are all white except for one Japanese man. A few play horse shoes. Georgina places Hors d’oeuvres.
Rose and Chris walk through the party.
Chris glances through the kitchen window where Missy entertains some guests. She makes eye contact with Chris and then looks away.
Chris and Rose are stopped by GORDON GREENE, 68, and his wife EMILY GREENE, 67. Gordon is a cute man with a cane and impish excitement. Emily is pretty and birdlike. They watch Chris intently and smile from ear to ear. Gordon shakes Chris’ hand thoroughly.
GORDON
Nice to meet you, Chris. Nice to
meet you indeed.
(to Emily)
Good grip.
CHRIS
Thanks. You too.
GORDON
You ever play golf?
CHRIS
Once, actually; a few years ago. I wasn’t very good.
47.
EMILY
Gordon was a professional golfer
for years.
CHRIS
Oh? No kidding.
GORDON
Can’t quite swing the hips like I
used to though. You know: I know
Tiger.
Rose and Chris share a subtle smirk.
ROSE
CHRIS
Wow, that’s great.
Cool.
EMILY
Gordon loves Tiger.
GORDON
Best I’ve ever seen.	Ever, hands
down. Let’s see your form.
Chris humors him.
GORDON (CONT’D)
If I knew what I know now at your age? Now then I could really play.
CHRIS
It’d be kind of a waste of time
travel though.
They laugh.
EXT. BACKYARD - LATER
Chris and Rose speak to NELSON DEETS, 82, who’s smiles in a wheelchair with an oxygen mask, and LISA DEETS, 54, a loose-lipped trophy wife smiles at Chris in a predatory manner. She has a Dutch accent.
LISA
(to Rose)
How handsome is he?
ROSE
Extremely.
Lisa squeezes Chris’ bicep. A bit too familiar.
48.
LISA
Not bad huh, Nelson?
Nelson just stares.
LISA (CONT’D)
(to Rose)
So, is it true? The love making. Is it better?
Rose cackles at the bluntness of the question. Chris almost chokes on his drink. Lisa continues to size Chris up.
CHRIS
Wow. Um... 
LISA
(to Rose)
I’m being too forward?
ROSE
We’ll talk later.
CHRIS
Oh, will you now?
EXT. BACKYARD - LATER
Chris and Rose talk to PARKER DRAY, 60, and APRIL DRAY, 57. They are a rose-cheeked tipsy wasp couple. Chris and Rose try to mask boredom and annoyance.
APRIL
Who even cares about skin color? My
God.
CHRIS
A lot of people do.--
PARKER
I told you, April. The world cares, It’s human nature to care. It’s not like one’s better than the other.
When you look at the big picture, you’ll see its always shifting. The question of “What skin color is more “culturally advantageous” that is.
ROSE
I’m sorry...  What are you saying?
49.
PARKER
Well take this country. Fairer skin has been in favor the first couple of hundreds of years, but the pendulum has swung back again hasn't it..? Black is “in fashion!”
CHRIS
Pardon me. I’m going to take some
pictures.
Chris walks away.
PARKER
I didn’t mean to offend him.
ROSE
Really? ‘Cause you have yet to say anything that’s not a convoluted blanket statement about race.
PARKER
Now Rose... 
Chris steps into the party to take pictures. He snaps a couple pictures of mingling guests. HE hears a group cackle.
He sees Dean schmoozing animatedly with three couples and the Japanese man. Dean quickly scans the party, finds Chris and points him out. The three couples wave and smile giddily. They had all just been talking about him. Chris pretends to not see this.
Suddenly, Chris sees another black guy in a particularly square ascot and golfing hat. The man stands at the bar and faces away from Chris. Relief.
EXT. BACKYARD - MOMENTS LATER
The man stands by the bar and makes himself a Martini. Chris approaches him.
CHRIS
It’s good to see another brother
around here.
The man turns to face Chris neatly. It is Andre, the jogger from the first scene, but he’s very different than before. He seems glazed-over with the same frozen smile as Walter and Georgina. Andre’s voice is completely different from the first scene. There is no longer any trace of an urban dialect. He speaks slowly and softly, enunciating his words precisely.
50.
ANDRE
Yes, of course it is.
Chris expects Andre to engage more. He doesn’t. He just stares at him smiling.
CHRIS
Who do you know?
Chris expects Andre to engage more. He doesn’t. He just stares at him smiling.
CHRIS (CONT’D)
Who do you know?
ANDRE
Why, the Armitage’s of course.
We’re friends of the family.
PHILOMENA(60), Caucasian, a stern and guarded wealthy woman, cuts between them.
PHILOMENA
(to Andre)
There you are. Here, put this
somewhere.
Philomena hands her napkin to Andre who pockets it obediently. Philomena places her hand on Andre’s back possessively.
PHILOMENA (CONT’D)
(to Chris)
Oh, hello. I’m Philomena...  and you are... ?
CHRIS
Chris. Rose’s boyfriend.
PHILOMENA
Fantastic. You really make a lovely couple.
ANDRE
I’m sorry, where are my manners.
Logan, Logan King.
(to Philomena)
Chris was just telling me that he felt more comfortable with my being here.
Chris is let down. Andre isn’t what he had hoped.
51.
PHILOMENA
That’s nice. Logan, I hate to tear you away, dear, but the Wincott’s were asking about you.
ANDRE/LOGAN
Ah, well it was nice meeting you
Chris.
CHRIS
Yeah.
Chris holds out his fist for Andre/Logan to bump.
Andre/Logan grabs Chris’ fist.
ANDRE/LOGAN
Tootles.
Andre/Logan and Philomena laugh and walk away. They join a small group of people who applaud Andre’s arrival. Andre does a little spin showing off his clothes.
EXT. BACKYARD - MOMENTS LATER
Chris comes looking for Rose. He is more creeped out and agitated. Dean projects over the crowd.
DEAN
Hello!
Everyone applauds and gives Dean their attention.
DEAN (CONT’D)
Ahem! If I can have your attention for a moment. Words cannot express how much it would mean to my father that after all these years we can all still get together like this.
Dean sees Chris.
DEAN (CONT’D)
Oh, actually first, everyone this
is my daughter’s boyfriend Chris.
Everyone turns to Chris. Too much attention.
DEAN (CONT’D)
Chris is a fantastic photographer and an all around good kid. If you haven’t met him yet, make sure you introduce yourself to him at some time during the party.
52.
Chris sees a man sits alone by the gazebo. His Chauffeur walks away. Chris walks over to the man as Dean speaks to the crowd.
DEAN (CONT’D)
You know, if Dad were alive, I know he would remind us of how the knights of old would gather in honor of a new crusade. He’d ask us to remember that though they’d massed great fortunes, the Templar lived lives of humility. So as we gather here today in celebration, let us not forget that our mission is far from over. In fact it’s just beginning. And in the years to come let us not forget the sacrifices that have been made so long ago so that we might enjoy this wine, and these games. So for now let us drink to the dawn of a new era. One that has been given to us by the generations before us. Thank you. Cheers.
EXT. GAZEBO. DAY.
During Dean’s speech, Chris wanders away from the group.
JIM
Ignorance... 
Chris hadn’t seen Jim Hudson, the blind man, who sits in front of the gazebo with his seeing eye dog. He is close to Chris, but far enough away from the group that no one else hears them.
CHRIS
Who?
JIM
All of them. They mean well but they have no idea what real people go through.
CHRIS
I guess people only see what’s in
front of them.
Chris notices his faux pas.
53.
CHRIS (CONT’D)
I mean... 
JIM
You’re right. And usually not even that much. That’s people. Jim Hudson.
CHRIS
Chris-
JIM
I know who you are. I’m an admirer of your work; you have a great eye... 
CHRIS
Wait. Jim Hudson...  of Hudson
Galleries?
Jim smiles.
JIM
Believe me. The irony of being a blind art dealer isn’t lost on me.
CHRIS
How do you do it?
JIM
My assistant describes work to me in great detail. You’ve got something...  The images you capture...  so brutal; I mean...  so melancholic. Powerful stuff. I think.
CHRIS
Thank you.
JIM
I used to dabble myself. Wilderness mostly. I submitted to Nat Geo 14 times before realizing I didn’t have “the eye” for it. No one took me seriously in the art world until I began dealing and then, of course, my vision went to shit.
The party guests APPLAUD the end of Dean’s speech.
CHRIS
Damn.
54.
JIM
I know. Life can be a sick joke. One day you're developing prints in a dark room, and the next day - BAM. You wake up in the dark. Genetic disease.
CHRIS
Shit ain’t fair, man.
JIM
You got that right. Shit ain’t
fair.
Jeremy comes over with his preppy friend, Derrick, 29.
JEREMY
Chris, we were hoping we could
borrow you. I need to kick
someone’s ass in Badminton.
Chris rolls his eyes.
CHRIS
(to Jim)
Nice to meet you.
Chris, Jeremy and Derrick begin to leave.
JIM
Stop by the gallery. Bout time you had a solo show.
CHRIS
Really? Wow, okay. Thank you. That would be a game changer.
JEREMY
We’ll get together some time.
EXT. BACKYARD - LATER
Chris and Rose play badminton against Jeremy and Derrick. Chris is actually having fun. He swings big but misses the shuttlecock.
JEREMY
HA! Come on, come on, come on. You can do better than that, Bruh!
CHRIS
Not my game.
55.
JEREMY
Thought you didn’t have a game.
ROSE
Shut up Jeremy.
JEREMY
I’m just saying, if your boy isn’t gonna bring even a little heat, we might as well bring one of Grandpas old friends up here.
CHRIS
Whoa, whoa, okay.	Now we talkin’
smack huh?
JEREMY
Your serve.
Chris serves the shuttlecock hard. The following rally is long. As they play the more and more guests come over to watch. They aren’t following the shuttlecock as much as watching Chris. Chris ends it with an impressive diving swat. Derrick misses the return and the crowd goes wild. Chris throws his arms up in celebration.
CHRIS
Boom!
ROSE
Yay, baby!
JEREMY
That’s what I’m talking about!!!
Okay, I see you dog! I see you!
Again!
Chris is about to serve. He scans the crowd of beaming faces. Everyone is rooting for Chris. They love him. Chris scans the crowd. It’s too much.
CHRIS
Hold up.	Here.
ROSE
Where are you--
CHRIS
I’m gonna go to the bathroom.
Chris gives his racket to Gordon Greene.
56.
INT. ARMITAGE HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY
Chris walks through the kitchen.
INT. ARMITAGE LIVING ROOM - DAY
Chris slips past several small groups of guests mingling. He goes up the stairs to the second floor.
As soon as he is out of sight and earshot, the mingling guests stop in mid-conversation. Everyone in the room waits and listens to Chris’ footsteps above. It is now clear that their conversations have been fake. They are all hanging on Chris’ actions.
INT. ARMITAGE UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY
Chris walks to Rose’ room.
INT. ROSE’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
Chris enters Rose’s room. The bed is made. He picks his phone up from the dresser. It’s unplugged and out of batteries. That’s odd. He plugs it in again as he hears a CREAK down the hall.
INT. ARMITAGE UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY
Chris leaves Rose’s room. Across the hallway is a crack open. Chris slowly walks down the hall, and peers inside. He sees a couple hip hop posters, lacrosse trophies and jujitsu. Jeremy’s room. Movement inside. It’s Georgina making the bed.
INT. ARMITAGE LIVING ROOM - DAY
Rose enters looking for Chris. Everyone is mingling again.
She goes upstairs.
INT. ARMITAGE UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY
Chris looks in Jeremy’s room. The door creaks alerting Georgina of his presence, she turns slowly. Before she sees him he walks quickly back to Rose’s room just as she comes upstairs.
ROSE
Hey.
57.
Chris waves for her to join him back in her room.
INT. ROSE’S BEDROOM - DAY
ROSE
Hey, what the fuck? You left me out there.
Chris speaks quietly and frantically to Rose.
CHRIS
She unplugged my phone.
ROSE
Who?
CHRIS
Georgina. I’m trying to check in
with Rod, and I got no juice.
ROSE
So...  Why would she do that?
CHRIS
Maybe she doesn’t like the fact
that I’m with you.
ROSE
(Not buying it)
Really?
CHRIS
What? It’s a thing.
ROSE
I mean, she shouldn’t be unplugging peoples phones, but I don’t think she would do that on purpose.
CHRIS
Forget it. Nevermind.
ROSE
No. Don’t do that. Don’t shut me
out like that...  Don’t do that to
me. We’re a Badminton team.
CHRIS
Okay, yeah. I’m sorry. It’s all good. I’ll just plug it back in and I’ll be down in a minute, okay?
58.
ROSE
Okay...  Say hi to Rod and Sid for
me.
INT. CHRIS’ APARTMENT - DAY
Rod lies on the couch with Sid watching TV.
ROD
Oh, they got you on display?
INTERCUT WITH:
INT. ROSE’S ROOM - SAME TIME
Chris is alone in Rose’s room. He peers out the window.
CHRIS
It’s so weird, man. It’s like some of these people never met a black dude that doesn’t work for them.
ROD
Yup. You in it now.
CHRIS
Also, shit, I don’t even wanna tell you.
ROD
What?
CHRIS
I got hypnotized last night... 
ROD
Nigga, what the fuck?
CHRIS
Yeah, to quit smoking. Rose’s mom
is a psychiatrist--
ROD
I don’t give a fuck if a bitch is
Dr. Phil. You ain’t getting in my
head.
CHRIS
I know. She caught me off guard.
But it’s cool. I mean, it worked.
59.
ROD
Nope. That’s some scary shit. Who knows what they gonna make you do. White people into some crazy sex slave shit. You know that right?
Chris laughs.
CHRIS
Yeah, I’m pretty sure they’re not a kinky sex family--
ROD
Why not? Jeffery Dahmer ate niggas’ heads, but that was after he fucked the heads. You think they saw that shit coming? Hell no. One second they think they just gonna suck some dick, next second they sucking dick but their head isn’t on their body, Chris
CHRIS
And thanks for that image, right
there.
ROD
I saw that on A&E, so that’s real
life.
CHRIS
It’s the black people out here too though. It’s like their living in a different era.
ROD
Maybe they got hypnotized--
CHRIS
(dry)
Ha ha--
ROD
I’m just connecting the dots you presenting me with. The mom puttin’ trances on niggas and fuckin’ them. It’s clear as day and that’s fucked up. She hot?
CHRIS
What’s fucked up is: You’re the
first line of defense against
terrorism.
60.
ROD
Don’t say I didn’t warn you ‘cause my ass sure as Hell ain’t coming up to the country to save you from no fuckin’ witch coven...  Unless the mom’s really hot. On a scale of one to ten--
CHRIS
Thanks Rod, bye.
Chris hangs up and turns. Georgina stands in the doorway, eerie smile and all. Chris is startled.
GEORGINA
Hello.
CHRIS
Hi.
Georgina’s voice is shaky and careful. Pleasant on top, but angry underneath.
GEORGINA
I owe you an apology. How rude of me to have touched your belongings without asking.
CHRIS
Oh, no. It’s cool. I was just
confused.
GEORGINA
Just so you know, there was no funny business, allow me to explain. I had lifted your cellular phone this morning in order to wipe down the dresser and it accidentally came undone.
CHRIS
Yeah, I--
GEORGINA
Rather than meddle with it further, I left it that way. How foolish of me.
CHRIS
No. It’s fine. I wasn’t tryin’ to
snitch... 
GEORGINA
Snitch?
61.
CHRIS
Rat you out?
GEORGINA
“tattletale.”
CHRIS
Yeah.
GEORGINA
Don’t worry about that. I assure
you, I don’t answer to anyone.
CHRIS
Right...  Well, all I know is
sometimes, being around too many
white people makes me nervous.
He’s half joking. Georgina doesn’t laugh. Instead eyes get lost for a moment. A tear falls down her face as if there is a pain behind her otherwise vacant smile.
GEORGINA
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no...  Aren’t you something? That’s not my experience. Not at all. The Armitages are so good to us; They treat us like family.
EXT. BACKYARD - AFTERNOON
Chris walks back into the back yard where Dean entertains seven people Chris hasn’t met. They turn as Chris approaches smiling eagerly. They all seem to share a private joke.
DEAN
Chris! There you are, my brother. I wanted to introduce you to some old friends. We’ll do it quickly. Down the line: David and Marcia Wincott, Ronald and Celia Jeffries, Hiroki Tanaka, and Fredrich and Jessika Walden.
Each couple - DAVID and MARCIA, RONALD and CELIA, HIROKI, FREDRICH and JESSIKA - waves as they are name.
CHRIS
Too many names to remember but,
hi... 
The couples all laugh nervously.
62.
HIROKI
(to Dean in Japanese)
Can we ask him questions?
DEAN
(in Japanese)
Of course.
HIROKI
Do you find that being African American has more advantages or disadvantages in the modern world?
Chris pans the crowd who all give him their undivided attention. The silence is long. He looks for Rose. She is off talking to someone.
CHRIS
Yeah, I don’t know, man.
They all smile like hungry vampires. Chris is very uncomfortable with this unprovoked group interrogation. Andre/Logan and Philomena approach.
CHRIS (CONT’D)
That’s actually a great question.
Logan! They were asking me about
the African American experience.
Maybe you could take this one.
Andre/Logan is a little caught off guard but dives in.
ANDRE/LOGAN
My life as an African American has been, for the most part, very good. It’s hard to be too specific as I haven’t much desired to leave the house in a while.
The crowd chuckles. Chris takes out his phone.
PHILOMENA
We’ve become homebodies... 
ANDRE/LOGAN
(to Philomena)
But recently, even when you go to
the city, I’ve just had no
interest.
(to the group)
The chores	are my sanctu--
63.
With the attention on Andre/Logan, Chris raises his phone toward Andre/Logan and the group and snaps a picture. The flash pops.
CHRIS
Shit.
Everyone turns to Chris. Andre/Logan steps forward and looks at Chris oddly; His head cocks a little and his peaceful expression drifts slowly to maddened horror. Some of the party guests gasp.
PHILOMENA
Logan?
Andre/Logan drops his glass and stumbles towards Chris. Chris backs up, but Andre is already up in his space.
ANDRE
Get out.
Andre/Logan’s voice is higher and scratchy, like it was in the first scene.
CHRIS
Hey, man, I’m sorry, I--
Andre/Logan grabs Chris by the shoulders and screams shrilly.
Blood trickles out of his nose.
ANDRE
GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!!!!
Philomena and Jeremy grab Andre. They have to pry Andre/Logan’s grip off of Chris. When they do Andre/Logan screams bloodcurdlingly. It takes all their strength to bring him into the house. Missy follows.
INT. LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON
Rose sits on the couch arms crossed. Chris comforts her but is clearly traumatized. A few other concerned guests mill around. Dean enters and CLEARS HIS THROAT. Everyone gives him their attention.
ROSE
What the fuck was that?
DEAN
It was a seizure.
64.
ROSE
A seizure?
CHRIS
Why did he come at me like that?
DEAN
Seizures can have a wide range of
effects.
ROSE
Yeah, but randomly attacking
people?
DEAN
The flash on your phone must have
triggered it. Andre/Logan enters
with Missy and Philomena to a
smattering of concerned applause.
Jeremy follows.
Andre/Logan enters with Missy and Philomena to a smattering of concerned applause. Jeremy follows.
Andre/Logan addresses a group in his “Logan” voice. Chris now looks at him like he recognizes him.
ANDRE/LOGAN
Well, I do believe I owe you all an apology.
The group grumbles.
MISSY
We’re just glad you’re feeling
yourself again.
ANDRE/LOGAN
Well yes I am. Thank God you were
here to calm me down. I know I
scared you all quite a bit..
Especially you, Chris.
CHRIS
No, I’m sorry; the flash...  I
didn’t know.
ANDRE/LOGAN
Of course not. How could you have?
65.
PHILOMENA
(to Andre/Logan)
You shouldn’t have been drinking
either.
ANDRE/LOGAN
Right. Now you’ll all have to proceed without the aid of my marvelous wit; the whole ordeal has left me a quite a bit exhausted.
The group chuckles.
DEAN
Of course.
ANDRE/LOGAN
It was nice meeting you.
CHRIS
Yeah.
Chris is skeptical.
MISSY
(to Dean)
Something to brighten the mood?
Missy shows Philomena and Logan out. Andre and Philomena leave.
DEAN
Yes! I think it’s time for my dad’s favorite...  sparklers and BINGO.
JEREMY
Yes, Bingo!
The group applauds. Dean gives Rose and Chris sparklers.
ROSE
We’re going on a walk.
Rose grabs Chris’ hand and leads him out the front door. He pulls away from her as they leave.
EXT. THE WOODS - AFTERNOON
Rose and Chris walk by the lake. Their sparklers fizzle.
CHRIS
My cousin is epileptic. That wasn’t a seizure.
66.
ROSE
I mean...  my dad is a neurosurgeon.
CHRIS
How long have you known that guy?
ROSE
Not at all. I’ve known Philomena
since I was little, her husband
died last year. Logan is new... 
Why?
CHRIS
I don’t know. This is gonna sound weird, but when he got up in my face like that, I got this feeling like I knew him.
ROSE
You know Logan?
CHRIS
No, I don’t know Logan. I know that guy who grabbed me.
ROSE
Chris...  That doesn’t make any
sense.
EXT. BACK YARD. SAME TIME
With Chris and Rose are away, the party guests have all gathered in the back yard facing Dean who stands in front of the gazebo by a large picture of Chris on an easel. Everyone is silent.
Dean raises his hand and makes numbers with his fingers: “Three and three.” Several party guests raise their hands. Dean points to the Waldens.
This is an auction.
EXT. THE WOODS - SAME TIME
Rose and Chris are in little nook in the trees.
ROSE
No. No, no, no. Don’t do this..
67.
CHRIS
I don’t know what to say. I think
your mom got in my head. I think
she got into my head.
ROSE
I thought she helped you.
CHRIS
No she didn’t. She got in my head. She fucked some shit up there and since then... 
Chris shuts down.
ROSE
Chris...  I’m here. Talk to me.
INT. BACKYARD - SAME TIME
Dean raises his hand again making more numbers with his fingers: “4, 5.”
Gordon Greene raises his hand. Dean points to him accepting his bid.
EXT. WOODS - SAME TIME
CHRIS
It’s not about what’s happening,
it’s about what’s actually
happening.
ROSE
What’s happening? Explain it to me. I’m sorry, I don’t understand. Yes everybody is crazy out here but don’t take it out on me.
CHRIS
I’m not. I’m not. I just need to
go.
ROSE
You want me to stay here?
CHRIS
Whatever you want. I need to go
Rose sinks. She tries to hide a tear. After a long silence.
68.
ROSE
... I’m late.
CHRIS
Late?
ROSE
I should’ve got my period like last week.
CHRIS
Oh.
ROSE
I mean, I did change my birth control, so it could just be that, but... 
Chris thinks silently.
ROSE (CONT’D)
So... ?
CHRIS
I don’t know what to say.
ROSE
Say anything.
EXT. BACKYARD - SAME TIME
The auction is flying now. Dean’s hand signals are going fast. It’s down to three couples.
Dean signals “5, 6.” Mr. Greene raises his hand. Dean points.
Dean signals “5, 8.” Mrs. Deets raises her hand. Dean points.
Dean signals “6.” Jim Hudson raises both his hands and signals “10.” His chauffeur stands beside him whispering in his ear. Dean points at him.
Dean scans the crowd signaling “10, 2?” “10, 2?” The crowd looks around. No one is challenging. Dean smiles. Finally Dean bangs his fist onto his open palm and points to Jim Hudson. Jim’s chauffeur whispers in his ear.
The guests clap in a mixture of delight and disappointment.
69.
EXT. WOODS - DUSK
Chris and Rose sit watching the sunset over the lake. Chris kisses her hand. He hears the faint APPLAUSE in the distance. He looks in the direction of the house.
ROSE
I didn’t tell you that to make you stay, I just thought you should know.
CHRIS
I told you about the night my mom died; how I didn’t call 911; didn’t go out looking for her.
ROSE
Baby--
CHRIS
One hour went by, then two,
three...  I just sat there...  I just watched TV.
ROSE
It wasn’t your fault.
CHRIS
I found out later she had survived the initial by the side of the road all night, cold and alone. And that’s how she died in the early morning...  Cold and alone. And I was watching TV. There was time. If someone was looking for her, there was time. But no one was looking.
Chris cries. Rose cries for him.
ROSE
You were just a kid.
CHRIS
Yeah...  yeah.
ROSE
There’s nothing you could have
done... 
CHRIS
I could have tried...  I could have tried.
Rose almost responds, but doesn’t. She gets it.
70.
CHRIS (CONT’D)
You’re all I got now. I’m not gonna leave here without you. I‘m not going to abandon you. Okay?
She wipes her tears and nods.
ROSE
Let’s go back home.
CHRIS
Yeah?
ROSE
Yeah. I mean, you’re right. This
sucks. I’ll make something up.
We’ll go back.
CHRIS
I love you.
ROSE
I love you too.
The two get up and walk back toward the house.
EXT. FRONT LAWN - DUSK
Chris and Rose approach the house as the last of the guests get into their cars and drive off.
CHRIS
That was fast.
ROSE
Yeah.
The guests wave to Walter and Georgina, who stand at the front door, and then to Chris and Rose. Jeremy hangs out on the porch. He seems less menacing than before. Parker and April Dray are leaving. Parker is tipsy.
PARKER
Bye Chris!	It was a pleasure
meeting you. I hope you--
Chris and Rose wave.
APRIL
Come on, Parker. Before you say
something stupid.
71.
Chris laughs. Walter shuts the car door behind Lisa. Walter stands pleasantly watching the cars leave. He turns to Chris with the same ol’ smile. Chris and Rose enter the house.
INT. ARMITAGE BATHROOM - NIGHT
Sink running. Chris washes his hands and looks in the mirror.
He finds the picture he took of Logan/Andre on his phone and sends it.
Chris plugs the phone in and goes to pack. The phone vibrates.
Chris picks it up.
CHRIS
Hey.
INTERCUT WITH:
INT. CHRIS’ APARTMENT - NIGHT
Rod is on the phone. Sid is there too.
ROD
That’s Dre.
CHRIS
Dre?
ROD
Andre Hayworth! He used to kick it with Veronica, remember? That’s him.
CHRIS
Veronica from... 
ROD
... Teresa’s sister! Worked at the
movie theatre on 8th. Why’s he
dressed like that?
CHRIS
(realizing)
Yeah. That is him. But...  Wait,
wait, wait, This is so fuckin’
crazy. He’s different.
72.
ROD
No shit. Why is he dressed like
that?
CHRIS
No, it’s not just that though, it’s everything. He came to the party with a white woman like thirty years older than him.
ROD
What?
CHRIS
I don’t know if she was his boss or if they’re fuckin’ or both.
ROD
Slave! Chris, you in a fucked up Eyes Wide Shut situation. You need to--.
The phone goes dead. No batteries.
