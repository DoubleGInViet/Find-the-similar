INT. ROSE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Chris goes to finish packing with a purpose. Rose enters.
ROSE
Hey, should we eat and then leave?
CHRIS
No. Rose, we gotta go.
ROSE
Is everything okay?
CHRIS
I’ll tell you in the car.
She does.
ROSE
Okay, I’m gonna get my bag.
Rose leaves.
Just then Rose’s closet creaks open. Chris sees a framed picture of Rose inside. Not quite knowing what he’s looking for, he goes to the closet. The picture is a frightening one. Rose is one of the witches in a high school production of Macbeth. It’s on top of a red shoebox that has the drama/comedy masks drawn on top of it.
73.
He takes it off of the shelf. Inside is a pile of pictures. On top is one of Rose dressed as Juliet in a high school play.
The next one is of Rose at 13 playing Ms. Hannigan in Annie. Chris flips through a few more pictures of Rose at different ages in different class plays.
Finally Chris comes upon a photo printed from a computer. It’s a selfie of her and some other black guy. The picture is almost identical to the one she took with Chris before the ride up. Under the image are written the words. “X-mas 2014” Stunned, Chris flips to the next picture.
It’s another romantic selfie, this time with a different black guy. Underneath, the caption “Memorial Day 2013”
He continues flipping through the stack of pictures of Rose with 8 different black guys. The last one is a picture of Rose with Walter. In it she kisses Walter’s cheek intimately. “Thanksgiving 2009” Walter looks different in the picture. He isn’t smiling vaguely; he’s got swagger.
ROSE (CONT’D)
Hey? Are you ready?
Rose stands there in the doorway behind him. Chris subtly drops the pictures back in the shoebox.
ROSE (CONT’D)
What?
CHRIS
Yeah, Um...  Looking for my camera.
ROSE
Here.
Rose hands him the camera.
CHRIS
Where are the keys..? I’m gonna put our bags in the trunk real quick.
Rose picks up her bag and ruffles through it.
ROSE
Okay. They’re in here somewhere.
Are you okay?
CHRIS
Yeah, yeah. Can we do that on the
move.
74.
Chris walks out the door, leaving Rose.
INT. FOYER/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Rose follows Chris down the stairs.
ROSE
(Hushed)
Chris...  What’s wrong?
CHRIS
Nothing.
Jeremy stands near the front door twirling his lacrosse stick.
JEREMY
Where are you going? The party’s
just getting started.
CHRIS
I’m going to the car; see if we
left the keys in there.
Missy enters the hallway behind Chris.
MISSY
Would you like some tea, Chris?
CHRIS
I’m good.
The family is silent. Missy’s glare pierces Chris. He avoids eye contact.
MISSY
You’re leaving us. Is something
wrong?
CHRIS
No. Well, yeah...  Um.
ROSE
(still blank)
His dog is sick. He needs to go to the vet first thing in the morning--
Dean, in Missy’s office in front of the roaring fireplace, presses play on a remote control and a darkly classical track comes on.
DEAN
What is your purpose, Chris?
75.
CHRIS
What?
DEAN
In life? What is your purpose..?
CHRIS
Right now, it’s finding the keys.
Dean stares into the fire.
DEAN
Mesmerizing isn’t it? The fire is a reflection of our own mortality. It’s born, it breathes and then it dies.
CHRIS
Rose... 
Rose lamely rummages through her messy bag.
ROSE
I’m looking.
Dean now looks at the painting above the fireplace.
DEAN
Even the Sun will die some day, Chris. It is us who are the divine ones. We are the Gods who are trapped in cocoons.--
CHRIS
--Rose.--
DEAN
--You’d take the baptism wouldn’t you? You’d shed your skin to awake renewed and perfect. Of course you would.
CHRIS
I was raised Episcopalian.
Chris starts toward the door, but his path is blocked by Jeremy swinging at air.
JEREMY
Whoa! Be careful, bro.
MISSY
Jeremy... 
76.
JEREMY
I’m not doing anything.
MISSY
What is this shit?!!
DEAN
It’s our purpose! It is our destiny! The requirement for spiritual transmutation is the will of a new vessel must sacrifice!!!
CHRIS
Rose! The keys!
Rose backs away.
ROSE
You know I can’t give you the keys.
Chris makes a run for the door. Missy clinks the cup with her spoon.
TinG tinG.	TinG tinG.
The world instantly blurs around Chris. He begins to fall. He sees a flash.
INT. DARKNESS
Chris falls through the dark abyss of his mind again just like when he was hypnotized. The blue screen above him displays what his real eyes see. It’s his own perspective in the real world in which his body falls backwards to the floor. CRASH! The screen now shows the living room ceiling. Jeremy leans over him.
JEREMY
Oh shit!
MISSY (O.S.)
Is he hurt?
CHRIS
No!
JEREMY
Did you see him drop?
DEAN (O.S.)
He hit his head pretty good.
MISSY (O.S.)
Take him downstairs. Jeremy, get
the legs. Dean, help him.
77.
JEREMY
I can take him alone.
MISSY (O.S.)
No. Be careful. We’ve already
damaged him enough. Dean, please.
Chris continues to fall slowly further from the screen above which continues to show his body’s perspective as it is being lifted by Dean and Jeremy and carried out of the room.
CHRIS
Rose!? No, no, no, no. Shit,
shit... 
DEAN
You’re going to drop him.
JEREMY
No, I’m not.
MISSY (O.S.)
Be careful what you say, everyone.
He can hear every word.
JEREMY
Why? He’s gonna find out sooner or later..
MISSY
Not like this.
DEAN
Listen to your mother.
CHRIS
Rose!!!!
Rose approaches Chris’ face.
ROSE
(whisper)
You were one of my favorites.
Chris stops sinking. He turns right side up.
CHRIS
No!! Help!!!	Help!!!!! Help!!!!!!
A door creaks open. Chris’ body is taken downstairs into the darkness. The screen in the abyss goes dark.
Chris shivers. He’s cold and alone. He takes out his lighter and lights it.
78.
Something large and dark moves underneath Chris. Chris looks around frantically.
His light goes out.
CHRIS (CONT’D)
Shit.
Chris tries to light his lighter again. In takes a couple tries. Each flash illuminates a large face beside his. He doesn’t see it. The amorphous antlered thing emerges from the shadow. Its eyes glow and flicker faint blue in its sockets.
He finally lights the flame and feels the beast’s presence he turns, but the creature is gone.
He turns back and there it is. Very close. It’s head is the skull of a deer and it has dim blue glowing eyes. It MOANS A WRONG SOUNDING MOAN OF HATEFUL ANGUISH.
EXT. AIRPORT - DEPARTURES TERMINAL - DAY
Rod smokes a cigarette and dials Chris.
CHRIS’ VOICEMAIL MESSAGE (V.O.)
It’s Chris.	I’m away from my phone
or I just don’t want to talk to
you.
ROD
(anxious)
Sup? Dude, you scaring me, man? I
thought you were coming back
yesterday. Hopefully you home
already and just sleeping or some
shit. Aiight. Let me know.
INT. CHRIS’ LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Rod opens the door.	Sid wags his tail hungrily.
INT. CHRIS’ KITCHEN - LATER
Rod opens dog food while he calls Chris.
CHRIS’ VOICEMAIL MESSAGE (V.O.)
Hey, it’s Chris. I’m away from my phone or I just don’t want to talk to--
79.
Rod hangs up.	He places Sid’s bowl down. Sid doesn’t eat.
Instead Sid looks back up at Rod and WHINES.
ROD
Yeah...  me too.
INT. CHRIS’ LIVING ROOM - LATER
Rod zones out at Chris’ desk in front of his laptop. Sid sits on Rod’s lap. Rod types “Andre Hayworth” into the search engine. Images of Andre come up.
Rod finds an article entitled: “What Happened to Andre Hayworth?” Under in bold “Brooklyn Native Goes Missing In Evergreen Hallow.”
Rod’s eyes go wide.
ROD
Oh shit.
INT. GAMES ROOM - LATER
Chris wakes up. In front of him, a deer’s head is mounted above an old-school floor-standing television. Behind him, a goat’s head is mounted under a taxidermy owl, wings spread. There are several objects precisely placed around the room.
His arms and legs are fastened to a leather upholstered chair in the middle of a small dark room.
Chris pulls at the straps that bind his arms and legs. Chris tries to gnaw at the harnesses, but they are too thick.
CHRIS
Oh shit. Oh shit. Oh fuck. Oh shit.
The fuck?!?
The television in front of Chris flickers on and the image of a tea cup comes into focus on the screen. A spoon stirs and clinks the side of the cup.
“TING TING, TING TING”
Before he can react, Chris falls asleep.
INT. CHRIS’ LIVING ROOM - DAWN
Sid wakes Rod up with a lick to the face.	He’s on the sofa.
80.
INT. POLICE STATION - DAY
Rod sits at a desk with Sid on his lap.. DETECTIVE LATOYA (40), African American enters. She’s been doing this too long. She speaks to someone outside her office.
DETECTIVE LATOYA
... Then he should’ve gone back up there and made sure everything was accounted for. ‘Cause hey, look; how about this? If you record the evidence, you’re responsible for it.
Latoya shuts the door and sits at her desk. She begins opening and eating a bag of sunflower seeds.
DETECTIVE LATOYA (CONT’D)
Hello, Mr... 
ROD
Williams...  Rod Williams... 
DETECTIVE LATOYA
From the TSA?
ROD
Yes Ma’am.
DETECTIVE LATOYA
You know that TSA issues should be brought to your authorizing officer, right?
ROD
It’s not TSA business, ma’am.
DETECTIVE LATOYA
Please don’t call me “ma’am,” or
we’re not gonna get along. How can
I help you, Rod Williams from the
TSA?
ROD
Here it is: My boy Chris has been
missing for two days.
DETECTIVE LATOYA
Your son is missing?
ROD
No, sorry, not my son, my boy. He’s my friend. He’s 26. His name is Chris...  Washington... 
81.
He gives her time to write the name which she doesn’t do. She just stares at him.
ROD (CONT’D)
He left town on Friday with his
girlfriend Rose...  Armitage... 
She’s white.
DETECTIVE LATOYA
That’s four days ago.
ROD
Yeah, I mean he’s only been MISSING for two days. He was supposed--
DETECTIVE LATOYA
--I’m gonna stop you right there.
Now you know the minimum amount of
time without contact before you can
file a missing persons report is--
ROD
--Three days I know, but I have
reason to believe he’s been
abducted.
DETECTIVE LATOYA
Go on.
ROD
Chris was set to come back home on
Sunday. I was watching his dog Sid.
Latoya points to Sid.
DETECTIVE LATOYA
That’s Sid.
ROD
Yup. Cute right? Now look... 
Rod takes out his phone and scrolls to a photo of Andre.
ROD (CONT’D)
Chris sent me this which he took at the girlfriend's parents house. That’s Andre Hayworth, a guy we knew from back in the day. Come to find out he went missing 6 months ago in an affluent suburb upstate.
DETECTIVE LATOYA
Doesn’t look missing to me.
82.
ROD
Well that’s the thing. We found him and now, according to Chris, he’s got a different personality.
DETECTIVE LATOYA
Different how?
ROD
This dude is from Brooklyn. He
didn’t used to dress like that.
DETECTIVE LATOYA
I didn’t used to dress like this.
ROD
Plus, now he’s married to a white
woman twice his age.
DETECTIVE LATOYA
Well, that explains the clothes.
Look Rod Williams from the TSA-
ROD
I know, I know. I’m working up to it. Look, I know what I’m about to say is gonna sound crazy.
DETECTIVE LATOYA
Try me.
ROD
You ready for this... ? I think this family is abducting black people and brainwashing them to work for them as sex slaves and shit...  Sorry.
DETECTIVE LATOYA
... Brainwashing?
ROD
Yeah.
DETECTIVE LATOYA
Hold on one second.
(over her intercom)
Garcia, Drake, get in here a
second.
(to Rod)
I want you to tell these officers
exactly what you just told me.
83.
INT. POLICE STATION - MOMENTS LATER
Two detectives, Garcia, 37, and Drake, 43, stand behind Latoya.
ROD
... See, I don’t know if the hypnosis makes you a slave or what, but they already got two brothers that we know of, and who knows how many more there could be.
The officers are all riveted...  Then...  All three detectives laugh. Rod is not being taken the slightest bit seriously.
DETECTIVE LATOYA
(to her colleagues)
So, I don’t want none of you sayin’ I don’t do nothin’ for you...  White girls’ll get you every time!
They all laugh harder.
INT. GAMES ROOM - LATER
Chris wakes up suddenly. He takes in his surroundings again. He’s in the same room. He’s scratched the arm of the chair to the point where the leather on the arm of the chair has begun to rip open.
CHRIS
Okay. Okay! What do you want? You tryin’ to break me? Done. I’m broke. What do you want me to do? What do you want me to do????
Chris is exhausted. He laughs at the absurdity of the situation.
The television flickers on and again the image of a tea cup comes into focus on the screen. A spoon stirs and clinks the side of the cup. Terror flashes across his face.
CHRIS (CONT’D)
No--
Again Chris becomes paralyzed.
84.
INT. CHRIS’ APARTMENT - DUSK
Rod sits by the window with Sid. He looks out over rooftops and thinks. He picks up his phone and calls Chris again. He knows Chris won’t answer. Then--
ROSE
Hello?
Rod is taken off guard. He almost drops his phone.
ROSE (CONT’D)
Chris?
ROD
Yo. Um, Rose? It’s Rod.
ROSE
Hi.
ROD
Where’s Chris?
INTERCUT WITH:
INT. ARMITAGE HOUSE. DINING ROOM - DUSK
Rose stands by the dining table on Chris’ phone. Rose starts to cry.
ROSE
He left like two days ago.
ROD
He left?
ROSE
He got paranoid. We got in a fight. And flipped out. Then he took a cab home and left his phone. Wait...  You haven’t seen him?
ROD
No. He never made it back here.
ROSE
Oh my God.
ROD
I’ve been calling. I went to the
police and--
85.
ROSE
--What did you say?
ROD
I told them he was missing.
ROSE
Okay, wait...  um...  Did you call
his aunt?
ROD
Yes. Lemme ask you something, Rose.
What cab company did he use?
ROSE
I don’t know. A local one I’m guessing. Maybe Uber? Wait, I’m so confused... 
ROD
Hold on a second.
Rod hits mute.
ROD (CONT’D)
(under his breath)
This bitch knows she got something to do with this.
He opens up ‘Garage Band’ on Chris’ computer and puts the phone on speaker, recording her. He un-mutes the phone.
ROD (CONT’D)
So, last time Chris and I talked, he told me your mom hypnotized him?
Rose is silent. Then... 
ROSE
Rod, just stop.
ROD
Huh?
ROSE
I know why you’re calling.
ROD
Why is that?
We now see Rose’s family standing in the living room behind her. They watch her operate.
86.
ROSE
Come on. I mean, it’s kind of
obvious.
ROD
What?
ROSE
That there’s something between us.
ROD
No. I’m calling about Chris.
ROSE
We’d all go out drinking...  I
remember you looking at me.
ROD
That’s my best friend. If you did
something--
ROSE
I know you think about fucking me,
Rod.
ROD
--No. You crazy...  What? No!
Rod hangs up in a panic. He looks at Sid helplessly.
Rose’s expression goes blank. She places the phone on the dining room table and looks back at her family. They watch in approval.
INT. GAMES ROOM - DAY
Chris, still strapped to the chair, wakes up again. He is drained. The arm of the chair is more torn than before.
The television in front of Chris flickers on again... 
CHRIS
Wait--
The image that comes on isn’t the teacup this time. Instead it’s... 
EXT. ARMITAGE ESTATE - SUNSET
A beautiful landscape of the Armitage grounds. In it, the sun rises through a clearing in the trees accompanied by SOOTHING CLASSICAL GUITAR MUSIC.
87.
There is a distinctly dated mid 90’s feel to the look of the video. Chris is confused. The image pans to reveal ROMAN ARMITAGE 80 Caucasian, watching the sunset.
ROMAN
Ah, is there anything more
beautiful than a sun rise?
Roman turns to the camera. We recognize him as Dean’s father from the pictures in the hallway. Underneath the pleasant tone of the video, Roman suppresses a spiteful glee.
ROMAN (CONT’D)
Hi, I’m Roman Armitage, and if you’re watching this, your probably wondering what’s going on. Well don’t you worry, answers are coming soon. Let’s take a walk... 
EXT. ARMITAGE ESTATE - CONTINUOUS
Roman walks by a hedge which he occasionally prunes as he addresses the camera.
ROMAN
What if I told you, you would never have to work again. No more responsibility, or difficult life decisions. Isn’t that what you’d want? Let’s take a walk.
EXT. ARMITAGE’S BACK LAWN - MOMENTS LATER
Roman walks towards the back of the house.
ROMAN
You were chosen because of the physical advantages you’ve enjoyed your entire life. I’m certain that with your natural gifts and our determination we‘ll soon both be a part of something greater. Something perfect.
EXT. ARMITAGE BACK LAWN - MOMENTS LATER
Roman walks in the distance.
ROMAN (V.O.)
The Coagula procedure is a man-made miracle.
(MORE)
88.
ROMAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Our order had been developing it
for many many years, but was
perfected only recently by my own
flesh and blood.
EXT. ARMITAGE BACK LAWN - MOMENTS LATER
ROMAN (V.O.)
My family and I are honored to offer it as a service to members of our group.
As Roman approaches the house, JOSIE ARMITAGE, 78 Caucasian, waves to Roman through the kitchen window.
ROMAN
Save your strength. Don’t try to
fight it. You can’t stop the
inevitable.
EXT. ARMITAGE’S FRONT LAWN - MOMENTS LATER
The Armitage family stands around Roman. They are all 20 years younger. Dean, Missy, as well as 6 year old Rose and Jeremy.
ROMAN
And who knows, you might just enjoy being part of our family.
The family waves at the camera as it pulls out. The words “Behold the Coagula” come up. The Screen goes blank. A few seconds later. The screen pops back on to... 
INT. GAME ROOM - TELEVISION - DAY
Jim Hudson, with shaven head, sits on a hospital bed. And faces Chris through the television.
JIM
Hey Chris. How’s it going... ? You can answer. There’s an intercom in the room.
CHRIS
I need water.
JIM
I know, this probably feels like
some kind of sick joke or... 
89.
CHRIS
Where’s Rose?
JIM
You dirty dog. You’re one of the lucky one’s, trust me. Jeremy’s wrangling method sounds way less pleasant. I’m supposed to answer any outstanding questions you may have so far. I guess our common understanding of the process has a positive impact on the success rate of the procedure.
Chris is silent.
JIM (CONT’D)
Okay, then let me just tell you
what it is. Phase one was the
hypnotism. That’s how they sedate
you. Phase two is this. Mental
preparation. It’s basically a
psychological pre-op.
CHRIS
Pre-op?
INT. GAME ROOM - TELEVISION - DAY
The television turns off. Chris clenches his body trying to pry free from his restraints, before his shoulders collapse with exhaustion. He lifts his head. The leather arm of the chair is completely torn revealing tufts its cotton stuffing. Chris gets an idea.
INT. GAMES ROOM - DAY
We hear nothing except a HEART BEAT.
Chris’ head hangs, asleep.	His lips are dry. Chris wakes up.
The Television turns on. On the screen, a woman’s hand holds a tea cup. With a spoon, she clinks it. We don’t hear it though. We still hear nothing but the HEART BEAT.
CHRIS
No, No--
Before Chris can finish SCREAMING, his eyes widen. He goes limp -- unconscious again.
90.
INT. OPERATING ROOM.
Jim Hudson lies unconscious on one of two operating beds in the center of the room connected to an IV and heart monitors.
A bright medical light shines on Jim’s shaved head which also has a dotted line around it. The other bed is empty and has a light shining on it as well. This bed is for Chris.
Dean stands in ceremonial operating scrubs in the middle, his palms upwards in silent prayer near some ceremonial candles. Jeremy, also in scrubs, watches his father. Dean finishes his prayer.
DEAN
Saw... 
Jeremy hands Dean a circular surgical saw.
DEAN (CONT’D)
Get the vessel.
Jeremy leaves as Dean begins to saw into Jim’s cranium.
INT. DARK HALLWAY
Jeremy wheels a wheelchair and IV down the hallway.
JIM
For Phase three: Brain transplantation. Partial actually, the piece of your brain connected to the nervous system needs to stay put, keeping those intricate connections intact, so you won’t be gone; not completely. A sliver of you will still be in there somewhere; limited consciousness; You’ll be able to see and hear what your body is doing, but your existence will be as a passenger...  an audience. You’ll live
in--
CHRIS
(defeated)
--In The Sunken Place.
JIM
That’s it. That’s what she calls
it. I’ll control the motor
functions so I’ll be--
91.
CHRIS
--Me...  You’ll be me.
JIM
Good. You got it quick. Good on ya.
CHRIS
Why black people..?
JIM
Who knows. People want a change. Some people wanna be stronger, faster, cooler. Blah blah blah, but don’t lump me in with that ignorant shit. I could give two shits about race. I don’t care if you’re black, brown, green, purple...  whatever. People are people. What I want is deeper: Your eye, man. I want those things you see through.
CHRIS
That’s crazy.
JIM
Is there a greater complement?
INT. GAMES ROOM
Jeremy enters with the wheelchair. He unstraps Chris’ arms then legs. Then turns to prepare his IV.
Chris raises behind Jeremy with a bocce ball in his hand. He’s not really hypnotized! He hits Jeremy in the back of the head with the bocce ball. Jeremy crumples in pain. Chris hits him again. Jeremy falls limp and blood rushes from his head.
INT. OPERATING ROOM
Dean is busy sawing Jim’s cranium off.
INT. GAMES ROOM
Chris takes the earplugs out of his ears and can hear again.
INT. OPERATING ROOM
Dean finishes sawing the top of Jim’s skull off. He removes the cranium preciously exposing Jim’s brain.
92.
DEAN
Jeremy... ?
Dean walks to the doorway and scans the dark hallway. It’s quiet.
Chris emerges charging from the darkness with Deer’s head in his arms. He punctures Dean through the neck and body with the antlers. Dean and stumbles back into the operating room, bleeding from neck and torso.
DEAN (CONT’D)
Ahhh--
His scream gargles. Dean falls knocking a candle over which lights the unused bed on fire. The fire grows fast. Chris slams the door shut and continues through the dark hallway lined with ceremonial photos. He finds the pitch black stairwell and ascends to... 
INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
Georgina sits nearby knitting . The window, like before, reflects the room around them.
She sniffs the air. She is suddenly afraid. She turns off the light illuminating the back yard. She turns the light back on again. Chris’ bloodied reflection emerges from the basement door behind hers. He looks savage. Georgina runs out the back door.
Chris heads to the door, but sees his phone on the dining room table. He goes for it.
INT. MISSY’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Chris picks up his phone and presses the power button. The loading screen comes up. Chris walks to the front door.They see each other. The teacup is on the table by the chair in the middle of the room. They both go for it, Chris gets there first. He knocks the teacup off the desk shattering it. They stare each other down for a moment. Missy walks towards her desk and Chris follows.
Missy grabs a letter opener from the desk and stabs him through the hand. Chris grabs her wrists. He is unhinged. He pushes his forehead against hers in a show of primal dominance. In this moment he becomes a being motivated by revenge.
MISSY
No. No. No!
93.
Chris screams in rage. He pushes Missy further into her office. We hear the struggle and screams of a excruciating fight. We see a quick flash of a stab. We hear a CRASH as a lamp light turns off. The FIGHT SOUNDS slow down. MISSY GARGLES. Chris comes out of the room bloodier than before holding the letter opener.
INT. FOYER - CONTINUOUS
Chris turns towards the front door. Jeremy comes out of nowhere with blood all over his face, and puts Chris in a rear naked choke hold.
Chris attempts to stab Jeremy behind him twice but can't reach him. Chris grabs the door knob and opens the door; Jeremy SLAMS it shut. The struggle continues, and Jeremy’s choke sinks in deeper. Chris goes for the door again; Jeremy kicks the door shut propelling them both back into the wall. Chris looks down. He gets an idea but is losing consciousness fast.
With his last bit of awareness, Chris makes a final push towards the door. Reaches for the door knob again; a seemingly futile pursuit.
Chris opens the door again, Jeremy KICKS the door again; Chris STABS Jeremy in the leg. Jeremy falls to his knees.
Chris kicks him to the ground. Chris stomps on Jeremy’s head 3 times.
CHRIS
Jujitsu this Motherfucker!
Chris takes the keys from Jeremy’s pocket.
Moments later... 
INT. ROSE’S ROOM -NIGHT
Rose sits on her bed listening to music and researching college basketball. All her pictures are up again.
INT. SPORTS CAR - NIGHT
The sports car takes off. Chris is in the driver’s seat. The tubular metal helmet sits next to him in the passengers seat. His phone finally turns on. There is a very small amount of batteries. He turns the ignition. The English to French tutorial comes on.
94.
TUTORIAL
I seem to have misplaced my

Chris peels off, driving fast through the field into the night.
INT. SPORTS CAR ON RURAL ROAD
Chris dials 911.

CHRIS
I’m at the Armitage--
Chris looks in the rearview mirror. All of a sudden, BAM! The car slams into and over Georgina, who, in the night, seems to have come out of nowhere.
INT. ROSE’S ROOM - NIGHT
Rose takes off her head phones. She heard something.
EXT. ARMITAGE FRONT LAWN -NIGHT
He drives on a few more seconds on a flat tire but then stops the car. Chris breathes heavy.
CHRIS
(to himself)
No...  no...  Don’t do it...  Just get the fuck gotta here...  Just go! Just... 
He looks back and sees Georgina’s body laying motionless.
Chris flashes back.
INT. YOUNG CHRIS’ APARTMENT - NIGHT
Young Chris watches TV in his apartment.
INT. SPORTS CAR - NIGHT
Chris looks back at Georgina.
95.
CHRIS
Fuck!
EXT. ARMITAGE FRONT LAWN - NIGHT
Chris gets out of the car to get Georgina. The house is beginning to burn from deep inside. He lifts her up and
INT. SPORTS CAR - NIGHT
Moments later... 
TUTORIAL
Where is the nearest train station?
Ou est la gare la plus proche?
He puts Georgina into the passenger’s seat of the car. He shuts the door and gets in the driver’s seat. He floors it.
As Rose comes out of the house with a rifle.
ROSE
Grandma!!!
After a moment of driving, Georgina’s eyes open and she rises. She is Grandma. The wig slides off her head revealing an old surgical scar around the top of her head. Chris hasn’t noticed her yet. He reaches for his phone.
TUTORIAL
Can you please call the police? Pouvez-vous s’il vous plait appelez la police?
Annoyed, Chris turns off the sound system just before Georgina grabs his face. They both scream. Chris, veers the car into a tree. Georgina‘s head hits the windshield hard and bursts open. She’s dead. So is the car.
A bullet hits the rear view mirror. Rose stands with the hunting rifle 100 Ft behind the car. Chris crawls out of the car and runs. Rose shoots a tree and starts reloading.
ROSE
Grampa!
Walter, the grounds keeper, runs from behind Rose at top speed. Walter is grandpa aka Roman Armitage and he’s so fast.
96.
As Walter/Roman sprints across the front lawn strait at him. Walter’s hat flies off revealing the surgical scar around his head like the others. Walter/Roman closes the gap quickly. As Chris reaches the road, Walter/Grandpa pounces like a jaguar and rolls him over on his back. He grabs Chris’ face.
WALTER/ROMAN
Damn you to Hell!!!
Rose arrives behind them.
WALTER/ROMAN (CONT’D)
You ruined everything!!!
Chris, blinded, raises his phone to Walter/Roman’s face. He takes a picture, flashing strait into Walter/Roman’s eyes.
Walter/Roman doesn’t shoot. Instead he looks up. Rose is confused as to why Walter/Roman has stopped.
ROSE
What... ? Grandpa--?
Walter/Roman raises and gathers his bearing. His eye is cocked and blood trickles out of his nose. He holds his hand out for the gun. She gives it to him.
Walter/Roman shoots Rose in the stomach. She falls. Walter turns to Chris. His face changes from Walter’s anger to Roman’s rage. He points the gun at Chris.
WALTER/ROMAN
I never beat Jessie’s time.
CHRIS
What?
Walter/Roman raises the gun under his own chin and shoots himself through the head. He falls. Approaching sirens blare in the distance.
Chris lays in shock. It’s over until... 
Rose is still alive! Blood pours from her mouth.
ROSE
Ahhhhhh!
She goes for the gun, and grabs it, but Chris pulls her away and ends up on top.
ROSE (CONT’D)
Wait. Wait. Chris!... . Chri-
97.
Chris chokes her. Tears stream down his face. Chris is lost in violence.
CHRIS
Shhhh.
Rose convulses. She scratches his hand and cheeks. He’s too strong. She stares at Chris’ eyes as her consciousness fades. Then, through the agony, her face curls into a twisted smile. Psycho.
Chris pulls his hands off her neck. She’s not going to make him a monster. Rose is confused, sure he would do it.
CHRIS (CONT’D)
Cold and alone... 
Rose grimaces in agony. Her wound is bleeding a lot now.
Siren lights flash on the side of their heads. The scene doesn’t look good.
Chris turns towards them raising his hands. Rose smiles again and pleads with the approaching officers.
ROSE
Help. Help! He’s trying to kill me.
The driver of the car opens the door. It’s Rod. The siren’s are coming from a TSA security vehicle!
ROD
Oh shit! Chris!
(to Rose)
You fucked now, huh?
Chris hobbles to the car. He gets in the passengers side. The gravity of what he’s been through sets in. Rod looks at Chris. Rod tries to gauge Chris’ mental state by see He tries to breaking the tension.
Chris is silent and emotionless. Not a smirk. Rod realizes he may be too late to save Chris’ sanity. Rod looks at Rose through the windshield.
ROD (CONT’D)
What about her?
CHRIS
I think we need some time apart.
98.
Chris looks at Rod and gives a little smirk. Rod exhales in relief. Rod does a three point turn. Rod and Chris drive away leaving Rose to die.
ROD
I told you to get the fuck out that house, man.
Rose watches the car leave.
INT. ROD’S CAR. NIGHT
Chris in the passenger’s seat watches Rose get smaller in the rear view mirror. He takes a breath and shuts his eyes.
