DARKNESS.

We HEAR the strange, hollow cry of a BELL ringing in reverse. The warbled sound grows louder and louder until we...

FADE IN:

EXT.	HOSPITAL BELL TOWER -- POTSDAM UNIVERSITY - MORNING

The morning sunlight gleams off the great IRON CAST BELL as it continues ringing, but at its normal speed.

From this high up we can see how isolated the school is -- surrounded on one side by thick forest.

A small campus, mostly brick and ivy. In the Quad, a fraction of the students amble to their classes.

We glimpse the highlights: THE FOOTBALL FIELD. SORORITY ROW. AN ADMINISTRATIVE BUILDING. THE DORMS.

INT. CARTER’S DORM ROOM - MORNING

A boxed shrine to hip. From the “BLADE RUNNER” and vintage “STAR WARS” posters to the book shelf lined with plastic-sealed comics.

Tangled in black skull and crossbone sheets, we find TERESA “Tree” GELBMAN, 19, beautiful.

Outside, the bell tolls one final time before a calm settles over the room. The quiet doesn’t last long as Tree’s CELL PHONE plays “Happy Birthday”.

Tree stirs through the fog of her hang-over, searching for her phone. As she sits up, several things hit her at once: she’s not in her room, she’s wearing a guy’s T-shirt, and the guy it probably belongs to is bent down, putting something away under the couch.

CARTER DAVIS, 19, good looks hidden behind grunge and stubble, turns around and smiles at Tree.

CARTER
You’re up. I wasn’t --

TREE
(interrupting)

Where are my clothes?
 
2.


CARTER
On the night stand.

Tree fishes her phone out -- 1 missed call from “DAD”.
She snaps it shut with an exasperated sigh.

Tree pulls off the T-shirt, exposing a black lace bra.
Carter quickly turns his back to her.

CARTER (CONT’D)
I don’t know if you remember my
name. You were pretty wasted last

night. I’m Car--

TREE
Tylenol?

CARTER
What?

TREE
My head’s killing me. Do you have

any Tylenol?

CARTER
Uh, sure. Hold on a sec.

He starts rummaging through the debris of his room while Tree finishes getting dressed. Carter finds a bottle of aspirin in a TOILETRY BAG that was hidden under a pair of jeans. He offers her a pill. She snatches the bottle and dumps three in her hand and dry-swallows them like a pro.

CARTER (CONT’D)
I’m Carter.

TREE
(interrupting again)
Not a word of this to anyone. Got

it?

CARTER
Sure...

Tree starts to leave. The door is covered in a collage of band stickers and other bits and strips of randomness. In the middle of it all is a BUMPER STICKER that proclaims:

“TODAY IS THE FIRST DAY OF THE REST OF YOUR LIFE”

Tree opens the door and collides with a lanky FRESHMAN.
The words are already leaving his mouth:
 
3.


FRESHMAN
Dude! Did you hit that fine-vagine or what?!

He meets Tree’s hard stare and instantly shrinks. Tree pushes past him.

Carter shoots the freshman a look.

CARTER
Nice one, dickweed.

Carter’s eyes fall on Tree’s GOLD BRACELET, lying on the floor, as it catches the light from the open window. She must have knocked it off the night stand in her haste.

EXT. THE CAMPUS - MORNING

Dressed in a slinky outfit and heels, Tree is forced to make the “walk of shame” across the already bustling campus. She shields her eyes from the blinding sunlight.

She passes a female STUDENT who thrusts a petition at her.

STUDENT PROTESTER
Stop global warming!

Tree doesn’t deign to acknowledge the proffered clipboard.

A nearby CAR ALARM goes off.

Next, Tree notices a PAIR OF STUDENTS studying on the lawn as the sprinklers suddenly go off -- they’re getting soaked as they scramble to protect their books.

On the left, TREE passes a group of FRAT PLEDGES singing loudly. THE FRAT BROTHER stands beside a sign: “26th Straight Hour”.

FRAT PLEDGES
--	not a Willie or a Sam! I’m the eighth ole’ man named Henry! Henry the Eighth, I am!

FRAT BROTHER
Second verse, same as the first!
 
4.


FRAT PLEDGES
Oh, Henry the Eighth, I am, I
am!...

The crowd of onlookers cheer as one EXHAUSTED FRAT PLEDGE passes out, hitting his head hard on the pavement.

Tree reaches the end of the quad and starts down the steps, as KEITH LUMBLY (18, a big-boned mouthbreather) is just lumbering up the steps.

KEITH
Morning Tree!

She genuinely doesn’t see him... He sighs.

The end of the steps lead to SORORITY ROW. Tree’s house, KAPPA DELTA is a converted Mansion at the edge of the park.

INT. KAPPA DELTA HOUSE - MORNING

Tree creeps into the house -- trying to avoid any of her sisters. She’s got one foot on the stairs when:

DANIELLE (O.C.)
Oh-my-god. You sneaky beeyotch!

Busted. Tree turns around to face DANIELLE BOUSEMAN, 20, peroxide-pretty.

DANIELLLE
Who was it?

TREE
Nobody.

DANIELLLE
Sisters don’t keep secrets.

TREE
Seriously. It was nobody.

DANIELLLE
Well, I hope nobody used a condom. We don’t want somebody getting chlamydia.

TREE
Thanks for that, Danielle. Really, so thoughtful.
 
5.


DANIELLE
What are sisters for?

Tree starts up the stairs.

DANIELLLE
(calling after her)
Don’t forget! House meeting at

lunch!

TREE
Living for it!

INT.	TREE’S BEDROOM - MORNING

Tree has changed into new clothes and is running a brush through her tangled bed-head when her roommate, LORI SPENGLER (18, a cherubic faced redhead) steps from the bathroom, wet, wrapped in a towel.

LORI
She finally rolls in.

Shoving a pile of “rejected outfits” off her bed, Tree curls up with her childhood stuffed animal.

TREE
Did I totally embarrass myself

last night?

LORI
Not at all. Unless you consider dancing on a table, starting two fights, and barfing pretzel chunks all over the bar embarrassing.

TREE
Please tell me you’re kidding...

LORI
Oh, and you rammed your tongue
down Nick Sims’ throat right in

front of Danielle.

TREE
Get out!

LORI
For shizzle.
 
6.


TREE
But she was so nice to me this

morning?

LORI
I think she was as drunk as you last night. Consider it collective amnesia.

TREE
Thank god for that.

Tree looks at the clock.

TREE (CONT’D)
Crap! I’m so late for class!

Tree starts putting her backpack together. Her side of the room is a giant mess -- clothes, make-up, and trash strewn everywhere.

TREE (CONT’D)
I can’t find my damn book!

LORI
Maybe if you cleaned your side of
the room, you could actually find

something.

TREE
Just cause I’m not an OCD freak -- (finding her book)

Ha!

The TEXT BOOK is under a pile of mail on her desk. (Note: there’s a BLACK ENVELOPE on top of the pile but Tree pays it no attention.)

Lori clears her throat behind Tree -- Tree turns around and discovers her roommate holding a CUPCAKE with a single, burning candle.

LORI
Did you really think you could

keep it a secret from me?

TREE
How did you find out?
 
7.


LORI
Driver’s license. Not the best

picture of you, I might add.

TREE
I assume you changed my ringer

too?

LORI
(sly)

Who me? Never.

Tree reluctantly takes the cupcake. Closing her eyes, she makes a wish and blows the candle out.

LORI (CONT’D)
What’d you wish for?

TREE
A new roommate.

LORI
(laughing)

Wench.

And without a second thought, Tree dumps the cupcake into the trash.

LORI (CONT’D)
Hey!

TREE
Sorry. Too many carbs.

Lori looks a little hurt. Tree grabs her bag.

TREE (CONT’D)
Toodles.

LORI
Well, you’re welcome...

Tree’s already out the door.

Lori shakes her head: Tree thoughtlessly left the door open with Lori still standing there in the towel.

LORI (CONT’D)
Hello?	Towel here -- !
 
8.


INT.	DR. BUTLER’S SCIENCE CLASS - MORNING

Tree “sneaks” into the rear of the lecture hall. DR. GREGORY BUTLER (early 30’s, chiseled) jots notes on the chalkboard.

GREGORY
When extreme agitation occurs, locomotive response in the subjects show an acceleration across the quantum plane, where --

A quiet entrance is ruined by a very loud, squeaky door as Tree slinks into the room. As she takes a seat in the back she makes eye-contact with her professor.

Was that a sneer or a smirk he just flashed her?

EXT. LUNCH PATIO - AFTERNOON

A group of Kappa girls have gathered around a table, as Danielle conducts a house meeting with the intensity of a U.N. assembly. To her right, MONICA KEENER, 18, a nervous pledge, diligently takes notes on a legal pad.

The other girls, including Tree, absently suck on sugar-free, no whip Mochas OR what they call...lunch.

Visibly absent is Lori.

DANIELLE
--	and we still need to pick this year’s charity. I can say right now, there is no way we’re doing the Special Needs art fair again. All those tards want to do is hug. Totally freaked my shit out. Thoughts?

Another pledge, BECKY SHEPARD, 18, a little chunky but doing her best to fit-in, joins the group with her tray. All eyes fall on her food...a sandwich with a side of pasta salad, and a tall glass of chocolate milk.

Feeling the weight of their collective stares:

BECKY
What’s wrong?

DANIELLE
I don’t know. What’s wrong Tree?
 
9.


TREE
Nothing. Except for the buffet you just dumped on our table.

DANIELLE
And is that chocolate milk I see?

Becky looks horrified.

BECKY
(ashamed)

I missed breakfast.

She gets up with her tray and SLAMS into Carter. The chocolate milk slides off the tray and SPLASHES all over Tree. Danielle cracks up.

TREE
Ass--

She looks up and sees who it is.

TREE (CONT’D)
--hole.

Carter grabs some napkins from the dispenser on the table.

CARTER
I’m so sorry, Tree.

DANIELLE
You two know each other?

CARTER	TREE
Yes.	No.

They look at each other -- Tree’s eyes could burn holes through him. Carter remembers her threat earlier.

CARTER
(sheepish)
We...had a class together last

year.

Tree snatches the napkins from him and starts wiping herself down.

CARTER (CONT’D)
I just came by to return this.
 
10.


He offers Tree her bracelet.

CARTER (CONT’D)
I didn’t know where you lived--

Tree snatches it back and looks around to see if anybody saw the exchange. Luckily, they didn’t.

He waits for a “thank you”.

TREE
Help you?

Carter’s hurt turns to indignation. But he doesn’t bark at her. He’s better than that.

CARTER
Sorry again about the mess.

Carter walks off.

DANIELLE
What a douche-bag.

INT. CAMPUS BOOK STORE - AFTERNOON

Tree, a BLUE WORK SMOCK over the CHOCOLATE MILK STAIN on her blouse thumbs through a copy of US Weekly. Her boss, LEONARD GILBERT, 40’s, wormy, peers over her shoulder.

LEONARD
Teresa, I believe you’re supposed
to be unpacking the new shipment,
not reading about--
(reading the cover)

--Brangelina.

TREE
I’m still on my ten.

LEONARD
Your ten ended ten minutes ago,

missy.

Tree drops the magazine. As she heads toward the back, she passes a display of school-spirit paraphernalia including a stack of eerie MASKS (the school mascot).
 
11.


INT. STOCK ROOM - AFTERNOON

Fluorescent lights HUM in the sterile room as we find Tree hunched over a pile of text books, stamping the covers with STICKERS that say “REDUCED”.

Immersed in the mind-blowing monotony of her job, Tree doesn’t see the HULKING FIGURE standing behind her.

We SEE a BOX CUTTER in his dirty hand as the blade slowly slides out...

The figure leans in and SLASHES!--

--the plastic band wrapped around a pile of books next to Tree. She jumps!

ANGLE ON

Keith (the mouthbreather from before) standing behind Tree.

TREE
Don’t sneak up on me, Keith. It’s

creepy.

KEITH
Leonard wants to know if the books are ready.

Tree picks up a stack and shoves them into Keith’s arms. But he doesn’t move. He just stands there like a lug, holding the stack.

TREE
Anything else, Keith?

KEITH
Um...I was wondering what you were doing this Friday night?

TREE
Are you asking me on a date,

Keith?

His cheeks turn red.

KEITH
Well...sorta...
 
12.


Tree raises the gun and STAMPS Keith’s forehead with a “REDUCED” sticker.

TREE
Sorry, I’m busy.

INT.	CAMPUS HOSPITAL - AFTERNOON

Tree enters the lobby. Her cell phone plays “Happy Birthday”. Tree checks the LCD: INCOMING CALL FROM DAD.

She instantly hits the IGNORE button as she stops in front of the elevators. The doors open -- LORI steps out, wearing her NURSING SCRUBS.

TREE
(surprised)

Lori...

LORI
Hi.

She steps out. The doors close as Tree struggles with the stilted air between them.

TREE
So, I thought you only work

nights.

LORI
I’m doing a double for Jen. She

has the flu.

TREE
We missed you at the meeting

today.

LORI
I didn’t think I needed to be
there to decide what color
Danielle’s hair should be this

season.

Tree laughs.

LORI (CONT’D)
I guess I don’t have to ask what

you’re doing here.

The levity between them dissolves instantly.
 
13.


TREE
Gotta go.

Nudging past Lori, Tree presses elevator button.

LORI
Look, Tree...it’s none of my
business but I think eventually
something like that is bound to
have some pretty serious

consequences.

The doors open. Tree steps inside.

TREE
You’re right. It’s none of your

business.

The metal doors shut -- Lori’s disconcerted expression reflected in the polished surface.

INT. 4TH FLOOR -- HOSPITAL - AFTERNOON

Tree exits the elevator and discreetly slips past the nurse’s station and disappears behind a door marked “DR. GREGORY BUTLER”

As the door closes, we SEE a POLICE OFFICER stationed outside a door at the far end of the hall.

INT.	GREGORY’S OFFICE - AFTERNOON

Tree pushes open the door of this small cramped office and realizes she’s alone for a moment.

She notices a wedding picture of a happy bride and groom.

She smirks, places it face side down on the desk.

Gregory (Professor Butler) enters his office, closing the door behind him.

GREGORY
We can’t do this.	There’s too
much going on in the building

today.

TREE
Okay.	I’ll go.

She takes his CAR KEYS out of his hand and dumps them in his desk drawer.
 
14.


GREGORY
I have patients...

TREE
Yeah, and I’m losing mine.

ZIP!	She has her hands down his pants, kissing him hard.

GREGORY
(between kisses)
This doesn’t mean you’re passing

my course.

TREE
Do I look like I care?

They start kissing passionately -- Tree accidentally kicks the desk chair across the room. It wedges itself between the door and a file cabinet.

Which is perfect, as, suddenly... SOMEONE OUTSIDE opens the door and tries to enter, but it is jammed.

STEPHANIE
Gregory?	Are you there?

In what seems like an instant later...

... Gregory and a completely dressed Tree open the door for STEPHANIE BUTLER (pretty, fragile) Gregory’s wife.

GREGORY
Hey, Sweetie --

He gives Stephanie a kiss.

GREGORY (CONT’D)
-- just wrapping up here.

Tree squeezes past Stephanie and forces a smile -- which isn’t returned.

As Gregory closes the door, Stephanie glances back at Tree, who wonders if Stephanie suspects anything.

INT. TREE’S BEDROOM - EVENING

Tree sits on her bed, painting her toenails while a “Road Rules” marathon runs for the umpteenth time on MTV.

There’s a light knock at the door.
 
15.


TREE
Enter...

Danielle walks in, all dolled-up. Tree sizes her up, brow furrowed.

TREE (CONT’D)
Is that my top?

DANIELLE
How cute is it on me?

TREE
Just don’t get anything on it,

please.

DANIELLE
You mean like Nick’s jizz?

TREE
Wow. Classy.

DANIELLE
(ignoring her)
What time are you going to the

party tonight?

TREE
I don’t know...later.

Tree goes back to painting her nails.

Just then, there is a BLACK OUT.	It is 9:23.

DANIELLE
Our tuition dollars at work.

A moment later, the lights go back on.

DANIELLE (CONT’D)
Anyhoo...don’t be too late or all

the cute Sigma boys will be taken.

Danielle leaves.

Looking down, Tree notices she messed up one of her toes in the blackout. Tree growls. As she reaches over to grab the bottle of POLISH REMOVER, she spills the open bottle of RED NAIL POLISH on her bedspread.
 
16.


TREE
Damn it!

Tree jumps up and grabs a crumpled towel hanging over her desk chair. But something makes her freeze...

A PHOTOGRAPH...

Peeking out beneath her unopened mail (and the BLACK CARD).

She picks up the photo. We SEE Tree, dressed in her high school cap and gown, framed between her proud FATHER and MOTHER (Tree looks just like her).

The image cuts right to Tree’s heart -- so Tree does the only thing she knows, she hides the photo in the top drawer of the dresser. Out of sight, out of mind.

EXT.	THE THOROUGHFARE - NIGHT

Tree, in a resplendent white cotton dress, leaves her house and looks around. The area is completely empty of people. Most everyone at their respective pledge houses.

Tree checks her VOICE MAIL as she walks at a brisk clip.

GREGORY
(on the phone)

Hey, it’s me. I’ll text you later about meeting tonight. Not sure if I can get away but I’ll do my best. By the way, that was close this afternoon. But kinda hot.

Tree laughs.

SAVE -- NEXT MESSAGE...

ALAN
(pissed)
Tree, it’s dad. I sat in that
restaurant waiting for you for
almost an hour --

DELETE. Tree snaps her phone shut.

At the path she comes upon a blocked off area.

She glances at her watch.	10:43.
 
17.


TREE
Shit.

The lights are off along the cordoned and torn up path.
But it is the shortest way to the Quad.

Tree steps around the wooden barriers...

EXT.	THE PATH - NIGHT

Tree walks along the path, suddenly aware of... what?

Something?	Someone?

TREE
Hello?

She comes across a large ditch exposing a water pipe.
She realizes she has to edge around, towards the trees.

Taking a deep breath, convinced she is alone, she edges her way along the ditch. Her back to the trees.

Which is when a hand reaches out from the shadows and grabs her around the mouth!

Her muffled screams are cut short when she’s suddenly aware of the KNIFE that erupts from her chest! Before she can make sense of it...

She’s tossed in the ditch...

...where her rapidly draining blood mixes with the water and mud. She stares wide-eyed at an uncaring universe.

Then she is dead.

SLAM CUT:

INT. CARTER’S DORM ROOM - MORNING

Tree bolts awake -- realizing it was just a nightmare, she inhales deeply with relief. In the background we HEAR the bell toll the hour. Suddenly her cell phone rings...”Happy Birthday” plays.

Sitting up, Tree finds Carter bent over, putting something away beneath the sofa. He turns around, smiles.

CARTER
You’re up. I wasn’t --
 
18.


TREE
(interrupting)

My clothes?

CARTER
Uh...on the night stand.

Tree fishes her phone out of her jeans -- 1 missed call from “DAD”. She snaps the phone shut.

Tree starts changing into her clothes. Carter turns around.

CARTER (CONT’D)
I don’t know if you remember my
name. You were pretty wasted last

night. I’m Car--

TREE
(interrupting)

Carter.

He smiles, pleasantly surprised.

TREE (CONT’D)
Tylenol?

CARTER
What?

TREE
My head’s killing me. Do you have

any Tylenol?

CARTER
Uh, sure. Hold on a sec.

Carter begins searching. Tree grows inpatient and grabs his TOILETRY BAG under some clothes. She finds the bottle and dumps the pills in her hand.

CARTER (CONT’D)
(laughing)

Wow. Have you been here before?

The question makes Tree pause. How did she know where the aspirin was?

CARTER (CONT’D)
You okay?
 
19.


Tree is still thinking.

CARTER (CONT’D)
Tree?

She turns and looks at his door -- there’s the sticker:

“TODAY IS THE FIRST DAY OF THE REST OF YOUR LIFE”

Suddenly, the door opens. Enter lanky freshman...

FRESHMAN
Dude! Did you hit that fine-vagine or what?!

He immediately shrinks at the sight of her. A little freaked, Tree pushes past him and hurries out.

Carter shoots the freshman a look.

CARTER
Nice one, dickweed.

EXT. THE CAMPUS - MORNING

Shielding her eyes from the glaring sun, Tree makes the “walk of shame” again. But it’s all so familiar.

She passes the student protester.

STUDENT PROTESTER
Stop global warming!

The CAR ALARM goes off...

Then the sprinklers, soaking the studying pair.

The frat pledges...

FRAT PLEDGES
--	not a Willie or a Sam! I’m the eighth ole’ man named Henry! Henry the Eighth, I am!

FRAT BROTHER
Second verse, same as the first!

FRAT PLEDGES
Oh, Henry the Eighth, I am, I
am!...

Keith, waiting for Tree at the steps...
 
20.


KEITH
Morning Tree.

This time, she notices him.

TREE
Keith, what day is it?

KEITH
Tuesday, the eighteenth.

TREE
Are you sure?

KEITH
Says so right here on my watch.

He offers his wrist but Tree turns and looks back. The whole world looks a little off kilter to her.

INT. KAPPA DELTA HOUSE - MORNING

Tree doesn’t sneak in this time. But as she starts up the stairs...

DANIELLE
Oh-my-god. You sneaky beeyotch!

Tree turns around, clearly on edge.

DANIELLE (CONT’D)
Who was it?
(off Tree’s blank
stare/offended)

Sisters don’t keep secrets.

TREE
No, I’m totally having deja vu

right now.

DANIELLE
I have it all the time. It’s
supposed to mean somebody’s like
walking over your grave or

something.

TREE
Seriously. I’ve had it all

morning. It’s crazy.
 
21.


DANIELLE
Maybe you should switch to water
next time, hon. You’re so Tara

Reid when you drink.

TREE
Thanks. I’ll keep that in mind.

DANIELLE
What are sisters for?

Tree starts up the stairs.

DANIELLE (CONT’D)
(calling after her)
Don’t forget! House meeting at

lunch!

Tree stops again, turns around. Danielle misinterprets the confused look in her eyes.

DANIELLE (CONT’D)
It’s been on the schedule board

since last Thursday, Tree.

TREE
Yeah...I remember.

The problem is she remembers everything.

INT. TREE’S BEDROOM - MORNING

Tree is changing when Lori steps from the bathroom, wrapped in a towel.

LORI
She finally rolls-in.

Tree just stares at her.

LORI (CONT’D)
You were sort of a mess last

night.

TREE
Dancing on a table, barfing

pretzel chunks?

LORI
You remember. I’m shocked.
 
22.


TREE
(re: the deja vu)

So weird.

LORI
Oh, and you rammed your tongue
down Nick Sims’ throat right in

front of Danielle.

TREE
I’m...late for class.

Grabbing her backpack, Tree immediately finds her book on the desk. When she looks up, Lori has the cupcake.

LORI
Did you really think you could

keep it a secret from me?

She hands the cupcake to Tree who is still totally tripping.

LORI (CONT’D)
Don’t you wanna know how I found

out?

TREE
You looked at my driver’s license.

LORI
Well, aren’t you the clever one.

TREE
I gotta go.

Tree sets the cupcake down.

LORI
But you didn’t even blow the

candle out.

She’s gone, pulling the door shut behind her. The wind BLOWS the candle out anyway.

Confused by Tree’s odd demeanor, Lori looks down at the cupcake.

CLOSE ON...

The candle...a sinewy rope of smoke rising from the extinguished wick.
 
23.


EXT. THE PATIO - AFTERNOON

The Delta’s are around the table as before. Tree is spacing out as Danielle holds court.

DANIELLE
--	and we still need to pick this year’s charity. I can say right now, there is no way we’re doing the Special Needs art fair again. All those tards want to do is hug. Totally freaked my shit out. Thoughts?

Becky arrives with her lunch tray.

BECKY
What’s wrong?

DANIELLE
I don’t know. What’s wrong Tree?

Tree suddenly looks up -- she only caught the tail-end of the conversation.

TREE
I’m just a little tired, I guess.

DANIELLE
No, dumb-ass. What’s wrong with

that?

She points at Becky’s food. Tree shakes her head.

DANIELLE (CONT’D)
So not Kappa-cuisine. And is that

chocolate milk I see?

BECKY
(ashamed)

I missed breakfast.

Humiliated, Becky stands with her tray, she starts to turn...

TREE
Becky, look out!

SLAM! Becky collides with Carter. The chocolate milk splashes all over Tree. Danielle cracks up. Carter grabs some napkins from the dispenser on the table.
 
24.


CARTER
I’m so sorry, Tree.

DANIELLE
You two know each other?

TREE	CARTER
No.	Yes.

Tree slowly turns and looks at Carter -- he sees the fear in her eyes. Translates it quickly:

CARTER
We...had a class together last
year.
(to Tree)

Sorry again.

He starts to walk off.

TREE
Hey!

He stops turns around. Tree walks up to him -- clears her throat awkwardly. Carter stares at her like she’s crazy until he looks down and sees her open hand.

TREE (CONT’D)
My bracelet?

CARTER
Oh. Yeah. Here--

Reaching into his pocket, he drops it into the palm of her hand. For a split-second Tree pauses -- how did she know he had it on him? Tree finally turns around and walks away.

DANIELLE (O.C.)
What a douche-bag.


INT.	CAMPUS BOOKSTORE - CONTINUOUS

Tree, her blue smock covers her chocolate milk stain, thumbs through her US Weekly... her brow is furrowed, this is all so fucking familiar to her. It is irritating.

She suddenly recalls Leonard approaching. Tree quickly hides the magazine and pretends to be pricing down some dictionaries with a red pen. He eyes her suspiciously.
 
25.


LEONARD
What are you doing?

TREE
(duh?)
Working.

LEONARD
I believe you’re supposed to be
unpacking the new shipment, not

pricing dictionaries.

Tree drops the marker and gets up. As she heads toward the back, she passes the display of school spirit paraphernalia.

She freezes --

--and picks something up we don’t see.

Trees looks like she’s just seen a ghost. Her own.

Off screen, there’s a loud BANG! Tree looks to her right where Keith has just dropped something. He looks at Tree. There’s something peculiar in his eyes.

Tree hurries past the stock room door. Keith moves to the display and studies what Tree just set down...

A MASK.

Keith’s big, meaty hand curls around the mask as he slowly brings it to his face -- his breathing even louder behind the eerie plastic grin.

There’s a FULL-LENGTH MIRROR to his right -- Keith twists his head to the right and meets his masked reflection.

Off his silent stare...

INT.	CAMPUS HOSPITAL - AFTERNOON

Tree enters the lobby. Her cell phone plays “Happy Birthday”. Tree checks the LCD: INCOMING CALL FROM DAD.

She instantly hits the IGNORE button as she stops in front of the elevators. The doors open as LORI steps out, wearing her NURSING SCRUBS.
 
26.


TREE
(surprised)

Lori...

LORI
Hi.

She steps out. This time Tree steps into the elevator. The doors start to close but Lori’s hand catches the bumper. The doors open.

LORI (CONT’D)
Everything okay?

TREE
Yeah. Fine.

LORI
You were acting really weird this

morning.

TREE
I’m having a weird day.

LORI
Look, it’s none of my business but I think eventually something like that is bound to have some pretty serious consequences.

TREE
Lori, I really can’t talk right

now.

LORI
Fine...it’s your life.

Lori pulls her hand back, letting the doors close.

INT.	GREGORY’S OFFICE - AFTERNOON

Alone, Tree turns over the wedding photo without looking at it. She pushes the photo under some papers.

Gregory enters, and quickly closes the door.

GREGORY
We can’t do this.	There’s too
much going on in the building

today.
 
27.


TREE
I need to talk to you.

She reaches around him... to LOCK THE DOOR.

GREGORY
Tree, I know what you’re going to

say.

TREE
You do?

Gregory puts his CAR KEYS in his desk.

GREGORY
It’s normal for a young girl to
have feelings for an older man.
But you can’t let it cross that

line. You can’t fall in love.

TREE
I’m not falling in love with you.

GREGORY
(relieved)

You’re not?

TREE
No. I’ve been having--

Overcome with lust at her proximity, Gregory lifts her to his desk and starts to kiss her -- Tree resists but he’s not stopping. Tree is overcome by a sudden sense of dread. She pushes him back.

TREE (CONT’D)
(breathless)

Your...wife?

He stops.

GREGORY
Okay. That’s kind of a buzz kill.

A jangling of the doorknob.	And then a loud knocking!

STEPHANIE (O.S.)
Gregory?	Are you in there?
 
28.


GREGORY
(hushed)

Thank god you locked the door!

Tree and Gregory hurriedly adjust their clothing and open the door -- Gregory giving a lame:

GREGORY (CONT’D)
Didn’t realize I locked the door.

Have you met my student Teresa?

STEPHANIE
No, I don’t think I have.

TREE
Hi.

Tree edges past. Stephanie gives Gregory a look regarding Tree: What was that about...? Gregory gives the loopdy-loop international sign for Parts On Order.

INT. 4TH FLOOR -- HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS

Heading toward the elevator, Tree passes the nurse’s station and overhears a couple NURSES whispering.

NURSE#1
Well, I’m not comfortable with it.

NURSE#2
Me neither.

They both look up at Tree at the same time. Tree’s immediate thought...Do they know about her and Gregory?

Diverting her eyes, Tree reaches the elevators. While she waits, she notices the POLICE OFFICER sitting at the end of the hall. Was he in her “dream”? (YES)

INT. TREE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

“Road Rules” is on the TV. Tree is at her dresser, looking at the same picture from her high school graduation. There’s a knock at the door...

Tree stuffs the photo into the top drawer as Danielle enters.

She’s all dolled-up. Tree recognizes her top instantly.
Reading Tree’s expression:
 
29.


DANIELLE
I know. I’m just borrowing it for

tonight. How cute is it on me?

Overwhelmed by her deja vu, Tree looks at the TV -- she recognizes the challenge on “Road Rules”.

DANIELLE (O.C.) (CONT’D)
What time are you going to the
party tonight?
(Tree doesn’t hear
her)

Hello?...earth to space-bitch...

Tree snaps out of it.

TREE
Huh?

DANIELLE
(pretending to use
sign-language)
What-time-are-you-going-to-the-
party?

TREE
I don’t know...later.

BLACKOUT.

TREE (CONT’D)
Oh my god!

The lights come back on.

DANIELLE
Our tuition dollars at work.

She sees the fear in Tree’s eyes.

DANIELLE (CONT’D)
Chill out. It’s just another

rolling blackout, sweetie.

TREE
(hopeful)

It happened before?
 
30.


DANIELLE
Yeah, like two weeks ago. I
remember because I was running on
the treadmill and almost ate shit.
I don’t know what’s so hard about
keeping the electricity on.
Anyhoo...don’t be too late or all
the cute Sigma boys will be taken.

She leaves. We HOLD ON Tree -- her face wrought with a mounting sense of dread.

EXT.	THE THOROUGHFARE - NIGHT

Tree, in a resplendent white cotton dress, leaves her house and looks around. The area is completely empty of people. Most everyone at their respective pledge houses.

Tree checks her VOICE MAIL as she walks at a brisk clip.

GREGORY
(on the phone)

Hey, it’s me. I’ll text you later about meeting tonight. Not sure if I can get away but I’ll do my best. By the way, that was close this afternoon. But kinda hot.

SAVE -- NEXT MESSAGE...

ALAN
(pissed)
Tree, it’s dad. I sat in that
restaurant waiting for you for
almost an hour --

DELETE. Tree snaps her phone shut.

At the path she comes upon a blocked off area. A palpable dread washes over her.

She glances at her watch.	10:43.

The lights are off along the cordoned and torn up path.
But it is the shortest way to the Quad.

TREE
(chiding herself)

You’re being an idiot. It was just a dream.
 
31.


Tree steps around the wooden barriers...

EXT.	THE PATH - NIGHT

She walks the path...skittish, but nope.	Nothing.

She comes across a ditch exposing a water pipe. She needs to edge around it, towards the trees.

Off screen a branch SNAPS! Tree freezes...

TREE
Hello? Somebody there?

She looks around. All seems quiet and still until she
catches something or someone move in her periphery....

Tree spins around. Just more space and the woods
beyond...but Tree’s eyes zero-in on something peeking out from behind one of the trees...

A FAINT GLIMMER OF LIGHT.

LIKE THE TIP OF A KNIFE.

Is somebody hiding behind the tree? Waiting?

TREE (CONT’D)
Screw this.

Tree turns and runs back the way she came and practically leaps over the wooden barrier.

EXT. FRAT HOUSE - EVENING

Hurrying up the path, Tree reaches the front door and rings the bell. It’s oddly quiet for a usually racous place.

Tree looks back over her shoulder to make sure she’s not being followed. When she turns back the door is already open.

Tree’s POV --

--	THE MASK instantly appears out of the darkness! Tree SCREAMS and throws a right hook! BAM!
The lights suddenly turn on revealing a CROWD gathered in the doorway.
 
32.

There’s a big “HAPPY BIRTHDAY” banner hanging on the wall. Everyone is staring at Tree in shock.

Somewhere in the back of the crowd, someone says:

PERSON (O.C.)
Happy Birthday?

The guy who just got slugged, NICK SIMS (21, major hottie) pulls his mask off, rubbing his red and swelling cheek.

NICK
What the hell, Tree?!

TREE
Oh my god! I thought you -- I

thought I was -- I’m so sorry.

Danielle steps forward, addressing the crowd:

DANIELLE
Don’t mess with a Kappa bitch!

The crowd cheers, bringing the levity back to the affair. Somebody CRANKS the music as Danielle pulls Tree into a hug.

INT. FRAT HOUSE - EVENING

The party is in full swing. Empty plastic cups shake on the speakers pumping out some old school party anthem.

Pushing through the throngs of REVELERS we find Tree in the corner with Danielle and some other randoms.

Tree checks her cell phone -- no new messages. The disappointment registers on her face.

DANIELLE
(looking around)

That slut.

TREE
Who?

DANIELLE
Lori. She said she’d be here.
She’s so out of the house next

year.
 
33.


TREE
I think she had a double shift.

DANIELLE
Whatevs. She’s been boning some

mystery guy.

Nick saddles up to Tree and offers her a beer.

NICK
Truce?

TREE
You know I didn’t mean it.

Danielle tries to wedge herself between these two -- there’s lots of hair-flipping and eye-lash batting but it’s pretty obvious that Nick is more interested in Tree.

TREE (CONT’D)
Why were you wearing that stupid

mask in the first place?

NICK
Big game’s on Friday. Just showing a little school spirit. Didn’t think I’d get clocked for it.

Danielle laughs REALLY LOUD. It’s desperate and draws an annoyed look from Nick.

TREE
I really am sorry. Did you ice it?

NICK
It’s fine.
(devilish grin)

You can make it up to me later.

He gives her a knowing wink before heading off into the crowd. Danielle looks like she’s going to kill Tree.

TREE
What?

DANIELLE
Don’t “what” me. You know exactly

what you’re doing, Tree.

TREE
Danielle--
 
34.


Danielle storms off in a huff. Tree’s CELL PHONE chimes.

She looks at the screen. 1 NEW TEXT.

It’s from Gregory:

“Sorry...can’t get away tonight. C U tomorrow?”

Hurt, Tree snaps the phone shut. Surrounded by people she hardly knows or hardly wants to know, Tree looks sad and alone.

Tree starts pushing her way toward the front door when she sees something--

--Nick. Heading upstairs. He looks right at Tree and flashes a smile that says “follow me”.

INT. UPSTAIRS HALL -- FRAT HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Tree reaches the top of the stairs, but Nick is already gone.

TREE
Nick?

She starts down the hall. Tries the first door on her right.

Tree’s POV -- THE BATHROOM. Two Kappa PARTY GIRLS (X-ing; eyes-wide, pupils totally dilated) are standing shoulder to shoulder at the sink. One of them is staring at herself in the mirror while the other pets a wash-cloth like it was her cat.

PARTY GIRL #1
(staring)
I’m so pretty...

PARTY GIRL #2
(petting)
It’s so soft...

They don’t even see Tree as she closes the door.

A little further down the hall, Tree tries another door...

Tree’s POV -- HALL CLOSET. A drunk COUPLE is getting it on.

She quickly shuts the door.
 
35.


The next door to her left is slightly ajar...

INT. NICK’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Nick is sitting on the bed wearing the MASK.

TREE
You want me to hit you again?

He stands and approaches her. Face to face, Tree laughs:

TREE (CONT’D)
Okay, I’m not into kinky. Lose the mask.

She tries taking the mask off but he stops her with a GLOVED HAND.

TREE (CONT’D)
What’s going on?

She sees something over his shoulder...her eyes go WIDE with terror!
