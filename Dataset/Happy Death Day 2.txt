ANGLE ON -- THE CLOSET

Nick’s semi-naked BODY lies on the closet floor. Blood pooling around him.

Tree starts to scream as her KILLER grabs her throat! He pulls out a knife! Before he can stab her, she’s already swinging a FRATERNITY PADDLE she grabbed off the night stand!

WHACK!

The hard wood, cracks his arm, knocking the knife out of the killer’s grip -- it drops behind the headboard!

Tree tries to go for the door but he blocks her!

TREE (CONT’D)
(screaming)

SOMEBODY HELP ME!

The music and crowd-walla easily drown-out her cries for help.

The killer grabs a HOCKEY STICK mounted on the wall as Tree backpedals toward the window. She pulls it half-way open when the killer takes a swing! Tree ducks!
 
36.


CLOSE ON

The bottom of the window frame as the hockey stick shears off the bottom of the wooden frame, exposing the jagged GLASS.

Trying to squirm away, Tree loses her footing and falls back onto the window sill. The killer’s gloved hand pins her down!

Looking up, Tree sees the sharp, exposed GLASS directly above her throat.

TREE (CONT’D)
NO!!!

The attacker grips the top of the frame and SLAMS the window shut!

SLAM CUT:

INT. CARTER’S DORM ROOM - MORNING

Tree wakes with a SCREAM. Clawing herself up into a seated position. Outside, the bell chimes the hour as Tree’s eyes dart around the room -- noting all the familiar bits and pieces.

TREE
This can’t be happening...this

can’t be real!

Carter is staring back at Tree, mouth agape.

CARTER
Everything...okay?

Cue “Happy Birthday” from Trees cell phone. She grabs the phone from her clothes on the night stand.

CLOSE ON -- THE LCD SCREEN

INCOMING CALL FROM “DAD”

On the brink of hysteria, Tree grabs her clothes and starts changing.

Carter turns his back to her.
 
37.


CARTER (CONT’D)
I don’t know if you remember my

name. You were --

TREE
--pretty wasted last night.

CARTER
Yeah.

TREE
And you’re name’s Carter?

CARTER
(perking-up)

Yeah.

TREE
But we’ve never met before?

CARTER
Not until last night. I mean, I’ve seen you around campus but we don’t exactly move in the same circles.

Tree’s eyes fill with tears.

TREE
This is a nightmare....

CARTER
(hurt/defensive)

I’m sorry...but you’re the one who wanted to come here last night!

Tree shoves him out of the way and runs for the door. She sees the sticker again.

TREE
Oh-my-god.

Tree throws her weight into the door, as it swings open --

FRESHMAN (O.C.)
Dude! Did you--

The door SMASHES the lanky kid in the face!

FRESHMAN (CONT’D)
Ow! Sonofa--
 
38.


He sees Tree. Sees the tears running down her cheeks.

FRESHMAN (CONT’D)
Oh. Hey.

Tree pushes him out of the way and runs down the hall.
The Freshman shoots Carter a look.

FRESHMAN (CONT’D)
Nice one, dickweed.

EXT. THE CAMPUS - MORNING

A distraught Tree hurries through the bustling campus.

She tries to side-steps the female PROTESTER who thrusts a petition at her.

STUDENT PROTESTER
Stop global warming!

Tree slaps the clipboard away.

STUDENT PROTESTER (CONT’D)
(shouting after her)

A simple “no-thanks” would do!

Car alarm...

Sprinklers...

TREE passes a group of FRAT PLEDGES singing loudly. THE FRAT BROTHER stands beside a sign: “26th Straight Hour”.

FRAT PLEDGES
--	not a Willie or a Sam! I’m the eighth ole’ man named Henry! Henry the Eighth, I am!

FRAT BROTHER
Second verse, same as the first!

FRAT PLEDGES
Oh, Henry the Eighth, I am, I
am!...

The crowd of onlookers cheer as one EXHAUSTED FRAT PLEDGE passes out, hitting his head hard on the pavement.
 
39.


Horrified by the re-play, Tree begins to run blindly! Reaching the end of the quad, Tree bounds down the steps and CRASHES into...

Keith.

KEITH
Morning Tree.

Tree backs away from him. Eyes wide with fear.

KEITH (CONT’D)
Tree--

She keeps running.

INT. KAPPA DELTA HOUSE - MORNING

Tree slams the door shut. She starts for the stairs but is forced to grab the rail. She’s having a hard time breathing.

DANIELLE (O.C.)
Oh-my-god. You sneaky beeyotch!

Tree turns around. Danielle sees tear-streaked cheeks, the wild look in her eyes.

DANIELLE (CONT’D)
What’s wrong?

She can’t answer. Doesn’t know how to explain. Instead, she just runs up the stairs.

DANIELLE (CONT’D)
Tree?!

She vanishes around the corner.

DANIELLE (CONT’D)
(baffled)
Freakshow.

INT. TREE’S BEDROOM - MORNING

Tree throws herself on her bed and sobs into her pillow. Lori steps out of the bathroom, wet and wrapped in a towel.

LORI
She finally rolls-in.
 
40.


Lori realizes Tree’s upset.

LORI (CONT’D)
Hey, what’s wrong?

TREE
I feel like I’m losing my mind,
Lori. I don’t know what’s

happening to me. I’m so confused.

LORI
Just calm down and start from the

beginning.

Tree takes a deep breath.

TREE
Have you ever had deja vu?

LORI
Sure. Everybody has.

TREE
Well, I’m having it but like...big time. This isn’t going to make any sense but, I’ve already lived through this day. Twice.

LORI
Tree--

TREE
I know! It’s not possible but it’s happening! I swear to god!

LORI
Look, Tree, I know this is a hard

day with your mom and all.

TREE
You made me a cupcake! For my
birthday! You’re about to give it
to me, right? And later tonight

there’s a surprise party!

LORI
Who told you? Was it Becky?
 
41.


TREE
No! Nobody told me! Don’t you see? I know what’s going to happen before it happens!

Tree grabs Lori’s arm, desperate/afraid.

TREE (CONT’D)
Lori, somebody’s going to kill me

today.

Lori looks at Tree in total shock -- but she suddenly cracks a smile and laughs.

LORI
Okay. I get it. Who put you up to

this? Danielle?

TREE
No! This isn’t some stupid joke! I’m being totally serious! It’s already happened! But I don’t know who it is!

LORI
Okay, Tree...you’re starting to

freak me out.

TREE
How do you think I feel?!

LORI
Tree, listen to me. Nobody’s

trying to kill you.

TREE
Yes, they are--

LORI
Tree! Look at me!

Gripping Tree by the shoulders, Lori looks into her eyes.

LORI (CONT’D)
You need to take the day off. Skip class. Get some rest. Maybe you can talk to somebody.

TREE
 
Who?
 
42.


INT. STUDENT HEALTH CENTER - AFTERNOON

We’re CLOSE ON a “FEELINGS CHART” (a poster featuring a series of cartoon faces with categorized moods matching corresponding expressions.)

Tree sits rigidly on a floral print sofa, surrounded by other posters encouraging “COMMUNICATION!” and proclaiming “DEPRESSION: IT’S NOT YOUR FAULT”.

A light rap on the door precedes the entrance of DR. MARY TURTLEBAUM (late 30’s, wispy, doe-eyed, saccharine). She checks her file before offering her hand.

MARY
Hello, Teresa, I’m Mary.

Mary sits down across from Tree, pen and pad at the ready.

MARY (CONT’D)
So, Teresa...what brings you here

today?

Tree struggles with how to even broach her crisis. After a few prolonged seconds of false-starts and hand-wringing, she decides just to blurt it out:

TREE
I’m reliving the same day over and over.

MARY
That’s fairly common. Lots of
people feel stuck in a rut. The

routine of life can often feel--

TREE
No, you don’t get it! I’m literally living the same day over and over! It’s like I can’t get out of it! And somebody keeps killing me!

MARY
I’m sorry?

TREE
He’s wearing one of those school
masks!

(MORE)
 
43.

TREE (CONT'D)
The other night -- which will actually be tonight --he stabbed me to death near the quad and then last night he chopped my head off with a window!
(off Mary’s reaction)
It was broken. He smashed it with
a hockey stick.
(off Mary’s raised
eyebrow)

Nevermind. Point is, I keep dying and then waking up. I’m scared out of my mind! I don’t want to die again!

Mary takes a beat to put this all down in her pad. Tree waits in agony for a response, for some miraculous intervention that’s going to make sense of it all. What she gets is:

MARY
(sing-song)
Okee-dokey. I’m just going to
recap to make sure I’m getting
this straight.
(reading from her
note pad)
You wake up today, Tuesday the 18th, and you re-live the same day over and over, and the same exact things happen in a specific, linear order, before a maniac wearing a mask stabs you or chops your head off, and then you wake up and start all over again?

TREE
Yes! But you make it sound so

crazy when you say it like that!

MARY
Teresa, first of all, there’s no
such thing as “crazy”. There’s a
very logical explanation for

what’s happening to you.

TREE
There is?
 
44.


MARY
Of course. Stress, fatigue,
repressed emotional trauma --
these are all powerful triggers.
Now what we can do, together, is
figure out which of these factors
is playing a role in
your...situation.

Tree stares at Mary incredulously as Mary begins flipping through her schedule book.

MARY (CONT’D)
I’m a little booked tomorrow, but

Thursday is wide open.

TREE
Lady, have you heard a single word
I’ve said?! I can’t come in

Thursday! I’ll be dead!

MARY
(placating)
I’m so sorry, Teresa. You’re
absolutely right. What I meant to
say was, in two days, which will
still be today, you can come in
and we can get down to the bottom
of this.

TREE
Right. Sounds great. I’ll just die a couple more times before I come back here to sit on this ugly couch so you can make me feel crazy and then tell me there’s no such thing as crazy even though what’s happening to me is totally-fucking-crazy!

Tree jumps up and grabs her bag.

TREE (CONT’D)
Thanks for the help.

She storms out and slams the door so hard the “FEELINGS” poster falls off the wall.
 
45.


INT. TREE’S BEDROOM - EVENING

The dresser slowly lumbers across the floor as Tree pushes it flush against her bedroom door. Along the way, a few items fall off the top -- including Tree’s graduation PHOTO with mom and dad.

Tree picks it up, studies the image for a second, tracing her finger over her mother’s smiling face.

Suddenly, somebody tries the handle. Tree looks at the door startled.

There’s a knock then:

DANIELLE (O.S.)
Tree? Why’s the door locked?

TREE
I’m...uh...just need a little

privacy.

DANIELLE (O.S.)
What time are you going to the

party tonight?

TREE
I don’t know...later.

Tree looks at the clock -- 9:22

Then the digit changes to 9:23

BLACKOUT.

DANIELLE (O.S.)
Our tuition dollars at work.

The lights turn back on.

DANIELLE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
Anyhoo...don’t be too late or all the cute Sigma boys will be taken.

Tree listens to Danielle’s FOOTSTEPS walking away -- her eyes suddenly filling with purpose...
 
46.


INT. TREE’S BEDROOM - LATER

Tree has dismantled her Ikea night stand and is nailing the wood panels over the windows. Finished, she gives them a good tug to be sure they’re secure.

With the windows sealed-shut and the door locked and securely blocked, she feels “safe”.

TV back on, Tree finds the CUPCAKE Lori made for her sitting on her desk. She settles onto her bed and begins peeling the paper off of her treat. About to take a bite, Tree notices the “Road Rules” marathon is still playing. It feels like a bad omen, she opts for a station change.

Tree begins searching for the remote but it’s nowhere to be found.

TREE
(annoyed)
Lori...what’d she do with the

freagin’ remote?

Tree goes to her desk, riffling through loose papers when she comes upon her stack of mail and THE BLACK ENVELOPE. There’s no post mark and the front is blank.

Perplexed, Tree opens it...

Inside the envelope is one of those 3-D cards featuring a weird little Elf waving a “Happy Birthday” sign attached to a tiny spring. As the sign bounces the Elf GIGGLES through a tiny, hidden voice box.

On the blank side of the card, written in black marker, a child-like scrawl reads:

“HOPE IT’S YOUR LAST ONE...”

Disturbed, Tree slowly lowers the card when --

The TV turns off.

Tree looks at it.

TREE (CONT’D)
What the hell?

She walks over and turns it back on manually. “Road Rules”. Tree immediately changes the channel.
 
47.


CLOSE ON -- THE TELEVISION SCREEN

The first station change brings us to the famous opening credits of “The Twilight Zone”.

TREE (CONT’D)
No shit.

She changes the channel again to an unfolding “Breaking Story” on a local news station. A female REPORTER standing outside the entrance to an EMERGENCY ROOM.

REPORTER
--where suspected murderer Joseph
Tombs is being treated for a
gunshot wound following a deadly
shoot-out this morning that left

one officer dead.

The story CUTS TO a MUG-SHOT of the menacing killer.

REPORTER (CONT’D)
Tombs had been the subject of a

nationwide manhunt--

The TV suddenly TURNS OFF AGAIN...

Tree freezes. In the stillness, we HEAR a scraping noise coming from

THE CLOSET.

At this moment, it dawns on Tree that she never checked the room before she barricaded herself inside.

Picking up the HAMMER, Tree advances slowly toward the closet -- the door is slightly ajar.

She grips the handle...raises the hammer, ready to strike...

PULLS!

ANGLE ON -- THE CLOSET

Empty.

Tree notes a lone wire hanger, gently scraping on the wall.
 
48.


She sighs with relief and closes the door. But as she turns around, Tree’s focus moves to another part of the room...

THE BATHROOM.

Through the open doorway, she can see the shower -- the opaque curtain is drawn. Did it just move a little?

Tree crosses the room.

IN THE BATHROOM

Tree stops at the shower. As she reaches out for the curtain...

The TV turns back on! A loud COMMERCIAL blares, scaring the shit out of us!

Spinning around, Tree looks at the TV. Her eyes slowly move to the bed and then the slip cover where the sole of a BLACK BOOT is just sticking out from under the fabric.

He’s hiding under the bed!

Tip-toeing back into the bedroom, Tree gingerly kneels down in front of the bed, keeping her hammer at the ready.

Looking over Tree’s shoulder, we SEE the shower curtain is OPEN -- as the masked killer emerges from the bathroom!

Tree doesn’t see him creeping toward her, the long blade of his knife at his side...

Tree yanks the slip up and finds the boot -- but it’s not attached to anybody. That’s when she HEARS it...

BREATHING.

Tree slowly turns around...

Before she can scream the killer strikes! Tree narrowly dodges the blade as it digs into the mattress!

Running for her door, Tree tries to push the dresser out of the way but there isn’t time! The killer is already behind her.
 
49.


INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE TREE’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

We HEAR Tree screaming in agony as her blood begins to spill-out under the crack of the blocked door...

SLAM CUT:

INT. CARTER’S DORM ROOM - MORNING

The tolling bells outside are drowned out by Tree’s hysterical awakening -- THRASHING and SCREAMING so loud that Carter himself screams from the shock!

CARTER
What’s wrong?!

Jumping out of bed too quickly, Tree suddenly doubles-over in pain. Carter rushes to her side.

CARTER (CONT’D)
Tree ---

She shoves him back. Her cell phone plays “Happy Birthday”. Tree grabs the phone and throws it against the wall.

TREE
SHUT UP!!!

Afraid, Carter jumps back. Tree grabs her head, distraught.

TREE (CONT’D)
Ohmygod..ohmygod...make it stop,
please make it stop...

Carter tries to approach Tree again.

CARTER
What’s wrong? Are you sick?

TREE
Just get away from me!

Pain subsiding, Tree pulls the T-shirt off and starts changing into her clothes. Carter spins around.

CARTER
I don’t know what’s going on but --
 
50.


Carter turns around -- Tree’s already out the door. A second later, the lanky freshman peeks into Carter’s room.

FRESHMAN
Dude...what’s up the psycho-
hottie?

EXT. THE CAMPUS - MORNING

Tree staggers through the crowded thoroughfare -- her eyes darting left and right. Everyone she passes has an air of menace.

Anyone could be her killer.

TREE’S POV -- VARIOUS “SUSPECTS” STARING BACK...

*	A PROFESSOR peering at us over the rim of his coffee cup.

*	A PAINTER, wearing a bandana over his mouth, looks up from his work to tracks us with his eyes.

*	A STUDENT VENDOR, working behind an espresso kiosk, stares at us through a glass partition.

Becoming winded again, Tree stops in the middle of the walk way. The student protester thrusts the petition at Tree!

STUDENT PROTESTER
Stop global warming!

Tree staggers back.

The car alarm goes off.

Then the sprinklers.

Behind her, the FRAT GUYS are singing...

FRAT PLEDGES
--	not a Willie or a Sam! I’m the eighth ole’ man named Henry! Henry the Eighth, I am!

FRAT BROTHER
Second verse, same as the first!
 
51.


Tree begins to turn in a circle, the world spinning around her in a kaleidoscopic nightmare!

The protester, the car alarm and the frat guy’s voices grow louder and louder!

Students begin to stop and stare at Tree, who is caught in the middle like a trapped animal.

The world begins to whirl faster and faster...

The voices become louder and louder...

Until everything builds to a deafening crescendo!

And Tree collapses onto the pavement.

INT. TREE’S HOSPITAL ROOM - AFTERNOON

Tree is arguing with DR. ELLIOT WINTER (50’s, kind face). Arms folded, pouting like an indignant little girl, Tree doesn’t want to be here.

TREE
It’s just a concussion right? That’s not a big deal. Why can’t I go?

DR. WINTER
Where’s your father? We’ve been
trying to contact him but we must

have an old number on file.

TREE
What do you need him for?

DR. WINTER
We need your full medical history. Our system’s down from the rolling black-outs and we can’t retrieve any records. Specifically, we’re trying to find out how many times you’ve been hospitalized.

TREE
Never.

DR. WINTER
Excuse me?
 
52.


TREE
I’ve never been hospitalized

before.

A grave expression falls over the doctor’s face.

TREE (CONT’D)
What?

Dr. Winter opens a file and puts up a series of X-RAYS on the LIGHT BOARD.

DR. WINTER
We just got these back from the

lab. You see here --

He runs his finger over a CHEST X-RAY.

DR. WINTER (CONT’D) These are your lungs. There’s some scar tissue here. At first we thought it was a sign of pneumothorax.
(off Tree’s blank
stare)
A collapsed lung. But then we saw
these...

He points to light-colored lines crisscrossing through her NECK and LOWER ABDOMEN.

DR. WINTER (CONT’D)
These are signs of major trauma,
Teresa. Given the severity of the
scar tissue and the size of the

lesions...

He shakes his head, unable to finish his sentence.

TREE
What?!

Slowly, Dr. Winter turns his baffled gaze on Tree.

DR. WINTER
You should be dead.

The words sink in slowly.
 
53.


DR. WINTER (CONT’D)
We’re going to keep you here for
observation. Your heart rate’s a

little low and we need--

TREE
(interrupting)

I have to go.

Tree starts to get out of bed.

DR. WINTER
Whoa.	Hold, on. You’re not going
anywhere.

TREE
I have to go! He’s going to kill

me again!

Dr. Winter forces Tree back into her bed.

DR. WINTER
Teresa, I need you to calm down...

TREE
NO! LET ME GO!

DR. WINTER
(calling out)

I need a little help in here!

Two NURSE’S rush into the room.

DR. WINTER (CONT’D) Get me three cc’s of pentobarbital right away.

Tree grabs Dr. Winter’s arms, pleading desperately:

TREE
Please...I don’t want to die

again...

DR. WINTER
Nobody’s going to hurt you Teresa.

We just want to help.

The nurse returns with the shot. Tree takes one look at the needle and starts freaking out.
 
54.


DR. WINTER (CONT’D)
(shouting at the
nurses)

Hold her down, damn it!

Arms pinned, Tree is helpless as the needle sinks into her skin. She begins to slow down, losing her motor skills. In a matter of seconds, she’s out again.

INT. TREE’S HOSPITAL ROOM - EVENING

A thick silence fills the air as Tree slowly begins to emerge from the fog of her sedation.

From her blurry POV we’re looking at the door. It slowly begins to OPEN.

A MAN enters...

As he draws closer, we SEE he’s wearing THE MASK.

Tree opens her mouth to scream, but no sound comes out!

He reaches out to grab her! Tree recoils!

But Tree’s vision pulls into focus and she realizes it’s just Gregory and he’s not wearing a mask.

He sits beside her.

GREGORY
Hey...Tree it’s me. It’s okay.

TREE
(alarmed)

What are you doing in here?

GREGORY
Just checking on you. I heard they had to sedate you. The drugs take a little while to wear off.

TREE
What day is it?

GREGORY
Tuesday, the 18th. Why?

Tree closes her eyes. It wasn’t a bad dream.

Her eyes fill with tears.
 
55.


TREE
Nobody...believes me.

GREGORY
Believes what?

TREE
That I’m dying...every day.

Must be the drugs.

Gregory brushes her hair out of her face.

GREGORY
I can’t stay long. Stephanie’s
gotten us into some god-awful
charity thing tonight. But I’ll
come check on you first thing in

the morning.

Tree licks her dry-lips.

TREE
I’m really thirsty.

Gregory starts to pour her some water.

TREE (CONT’D)
No water. Can you get me a Coke?

GREGORY
Sure. Be right back.

He kisses her forehead and leaves.

INT. HALLWAY -- HOSPITAL - MOMENTS LATER

Gregory fights with the machine as it won’t take his dollar. It finally sucks it in. He punches the button as the soda can dumps into the tray.

We TRACK Gregory back to Tree’s room.

GREGORY
(announcing as he
enters)
Special delivery...

INT. TREE’S HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Entering the room, Gregory comes to an abrupt halt...
 
56.


ANGLE ON -- TREE’S EMPTY BED

She’s gone.

INT. 4TH FLOOR -- HOSPITAL - SAME

Tree quietly exits the elevator -- there’s only one NURSE at the station but she’s too busy reading a cheesy harlequin novel to notice Tree as she tip-toes right past her.

Reaching the door to Gregory’s office, Tree glances to her right and notices the POLICE OFFICER isn’t stationed at the end of the hall. But his chair is still there beside a fresh, steaming cup of coffee.

INT. GREGORY’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Gingerly closing the door behind her, Tree goes straight to Gregory’s desk and opens the top drawer. She grabs what she came for...

HIS CAR KEYS.

INT. 4TH FLOOR -- HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS

Peering into the hallway, Tree makes sure the coast is clear. But as she reaches the elevator, the doors automatically open.

Tree freezes...

Gregory steps out.

GREGORY
Tree? What are you doing?

Tree bolts!

GREGORY (CONT’D)
Tree!

Running down the hall, Tree makes a desperate dash for the emergency exit. She’s still weak so it’s easy for Gregory to gain ground.

Passing a GURNEY, Tree stops to push it in Gregory’s direction. It slows him down a little but not enough.

Tree collides with the FIRE EXIT DOOR but it doesn’t budge.
 
57.


Gregory stops a few feet away from Tree.

GREGORY (CONT’D)
Tree, listen to me --

TREE
YOU KILLED ME!

GREGORY
Tree, you’re delirious. Let me

help you.

Tree turns back to the fire door and begins banging on the handle.

TREE
Somebody help me!!!

She feels something WET hit her hospital gown. Tree spins around...

ANGLE ON -- GREGORY

Eyes wide, blood running out of the corner of his mouth. He collapses to the floor revealing THE KILLER STANDING BEHIND HIM!

TREE (CONT’D)
No...

The killer rips the knife from Gregory’s back!

Tree kicks the handle this time. The door SWINGS OPEN just as the killer steps over Gregory’s body.

INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

Hobbling down the stairs, Tree looks up as the killer pursues!

Using everything she’s got, Tree runs down four more floors until she reaches the FIRST PARKING LEVEL.

INT. PARKING LEVEL 1 - CONTINUOUS

Bursting out the door, Tree screams for help but there’s no one around.

Behind her, the killer continues his relentless chase.
 
58.


Tree scans the area, desperately searching for Gregory’s car. There’s too many! It could be anywhere! She starts pressing the ALARM button on his key-chain.

The killer is getting closer!

Frantically pressing the button, an alarm finally goes off two rows over. Tree and the killer are about equidistant to the flashing lights and honking horn of Gregory’s car.

They both pause for a split-second. Waiting to see who makes the first move...

Sucking in a deep breath, Tree goes for it! Running harder than she’s ever run before in her life!

The killer keeps pace. It looks like they’re going to make it to Gregory’s car at the same time but Tree gets there first.

INT. GREGORY’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

Lunging into the car, Tree slams the door shut and hits the LOCK BUTTON just as the killer SLAMS against the driver’s side window!

Tree SCREAMS!

The killer immediately begins pounding the glass with the butt of his knife. Tree tries to start the car but her hands are trembling too much.

TREE
COME ON!!!

The glass begins to crack!

CLOSE ON -- THE KEY

As it slips into the ignition. Tree starts the engine and throws it in REVERSE!

Peeling rubber, Gregory’s car flies back and smashes into a parked car. Looking ahead, Tree sees the killer standing a few feet ahead.

Slamming the gear into DRIVE she stomps on the pedal -- the car lunges forward. The killer narrowly dives out of the way!
 
59.


INT. PARKING LEVEL 1 - CONTINUOUS

The killer slowly rises to his feet as Tree speeds off in Gregory’s car.

EXT. MAIN ENTRANCE -- POTSDAM UNIVERSITY - NIGHT

Racing off the campus grounds, Gregory’s car fish-tails onto the main road.

INT. GREGORY’S CAR - NIGHT

The lights of the isolated campus fade from view as Tree pushes the speedometer past 80.

Realizing she’s escaped, Tree is overcome by a wild euphoria. She begins pounding the steering wheel, laughing through her tears.

TREE
I did it!!!

Her celebration is cut short by the sound of SIRENS. Tree glances into the rear-view window as a POLICE CAR closes-in behind her.

TREE (CONT’D)
Shit.

Tree slows down and pulls onto the shoulder. OFFICER BILL SANTORA (40’s, seen too many Clint Eastwood movies) saunters up to the driver’s side and raps his knuckles on the glass. Tree rolls the window down, trying to stay calm.

TREE (CONT’D)
I know. I was speeding.

OFFICER SANTORA
Turn the engine off.

TREE
Sorry, officer.

She kills the engine.

OFFICER SANTORA
License and registration.

TREE
Um...I don’t have them.
 
60.


OFFICER SANTORA
Pardon?

TREE
(blurting out)

Someone’s trying to kill me again!

OFFICER SANTORA
Again?

TREE
Yes!
(realizing how that
sounds)
I mean no! I mean...he’s tried
before but this time I got away
but I didn’t have time to get my
clothes and my driver’s license
was in my pocket.

Santora grabs his FLASHLIGHT and shines it in Tree’s face. She squints back.

OFFICER SANTORA
Ma’am, are you under the influence of alcohol or any other controlled substance?

TREE
No! I’m not--
(pause/epiphany)
Wait. If I am, does that mean
you’ll arrest me and	put me in a

jail cell?

OFFICER SANTORA
That’s usually how it works.

Realizing she couldn’t be in a safer place:

TREE
I’m drunk!

OFFICER SANTORA
You are?

TREE
Wasted! And I’m high. Pills, weed, you name it man! I’m on it!

Santora couldn’t be more confused.
 
61.


OFFICER SANTORA
Well...then I’m placing you under

arrest.

TREE
Good idea.

She gets out of the car. Santora cuffs Tree’s hands behind her back and leads her to his cruiser. As he opens the back door, Tree looks at him and smiles.

TREE (CONT’D)
Thank you.

Officer Santora: Weirdo.

He pushes Tree into the backseat. The POLICE RADIO suddenly CRACKLES.

DISPATCHER
All units, we’ve got a 187 at the
university hospital.

Santora pauses, listening to the homicide report.

DISPATCHER (CONT’D)
Suspect is believed to be an
escaped patient. Be advised--

As Santora looks at Tree’s hospital gown he’s suddenly flooded by a BRIGHT LIGHT!

We HEAR an engine roar! Before he can even turn, Santora is struck by a speeding car! The impact SHEERS the back door right off as Tree SCREAMS in terror!

The UNKNOWN VEHICLE makes a hard 180 and stops.

Hands cuffed tightly behind her back, Tree struggles to get out of the cruiser. Feet crunching over broken glass, she finally manages to shimmy out.

The other car idles...Tree can’t see the DRIVER beyond the blinding HIGH-BEAMS.

Then she hears it: a door squeaking open. Footsteps begin to draw closer. Tree looks around, there’s nowhere to hide. Just miles of woods...

The driver, steps in front of one of the headlights -- backlit, we SEE it’s the masked killer.
 
62.


TREE
(screaming)

Why are you doing this to me?!

Unsheathing his hunting knife, the killer begins to advance.

Tree runs!

EXT. WOODS - CONTINUOUS

Fighting for balance, Tree makes a futile attempt to flee as her killer, with a clear advantage, takes his time.

Toying with her.

Tree screams for help but there’s nothing but miles of forest.

Branches whip Tree in the face as her bare feet crunch over twigs and, tiny jagged rocks.

With only a two-second lead, Tree runs as fast as she can. Looking over her shoulder, the killer is gaining ground!

Ahead, Tree sees some LIGHTS through the trees up ahead!

TREE
(screaming)

HELP! HELP ME!

She looks back over her shoulder again -- she’s suddenly confused.

He’s not behind her anymore...

Breaking out of the forest, Tree reaches a short clearing

--	she can see the lights of a FARM come into view. Then she DROPS OUT of frame!
She just ran off a cliff.

We HEAR Tree cry out as she plummets over two hundred feet! As she’s about to make impact with the jagged ROCKS below we...

SLAM CUT:

*ALTERNATE DEATH SCENE -- CONT. FROM PAGE 61*
 
63.


INT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT

Tree has just been placed into the backseat by Officer Santora. A split-second after he closes the car door...

WHAM!

Santora is struck by a speeding car as it broad-sides the police car in a flash of scraping metal and flying sparks!

Tree screams!

Looking though the plexi-glass partition, she can see Santora’s crumpled body, mercilessly displayed in the police car’s headlights.

Tree looks for the other car but it’s nowhere to be seen...

Suddenly, a pair of HIGH-BEAMS appear -- blinding Tree as the car roars toward her at full throttle!

Tree goes for the door handle! But there is none!

ANGLE ON -- THE SPEEDING CAR!

Blazing a head-on collision course!

Tree braces for impact but the other car SLAMS on its brakes at the last second!

Tires SCREECH! Then...silence.

The cop car is completely flooded with light now. Tree shields her eyes as we HEAR a door open and close outside followed by slow, encroaching FOOTSTEPS.

Suddenly a HAND slaps against Tree’s window! Tree yelps as the MASKED KILLER comes into view, peering at Tree like a bug in a jar.

TREE
What do you want?!

He presents something to her...A BIRTHDAY CANDLE?

The killer lights it.

What he does next is even more baffling to Tree. He simply turns around and goes back to his car.
 
64.


The killer’s car starts to back away...headlights fading until they’re the size of distant FLASHLIGHT BEAMS...

TREE (CONT’D)
(dumbfounded)

Where’s he going?...

And then his lights just GO OUT.

Beat...

OUTSIDE THE KILLER’S CAR:

The black-gloved hand emerges from the open driver’s-side window holding the birthday candle. He drops it...

WHOOSH!

A FLAME IGNITES!

The fire starts at the killer’s car (driver’s side)
quickly running toward the police car!

BACK IN THE POLICE CAR:

Tree beats on the glass but, it too, is bullet-proof. Looking toward the rear of the police car, Tree can see the damaged gas tank -- hemorrhaging GASOLINE from the previous collision.

ANGLE ON -- THE FLAMES

Running faster and faster in Tree’s direction!

CLOSE ON -- TREE

Face framed in the window as the glass suddenly reflects an ORANGE/RED glow...

TREE (CONT’D)
Oh Fu--

BOOM!!!

The car explodes into a massive ball of fire!

INT. CARTER’S DORM ROOM - MORNING

The tower bell rings one last time as Tree’s eyes SNAP OPEN...
 
65.


ECU -- we SEE the FIRE BALL flare and then vanish in the reflection of Tree’s eyes.

She sits up and wipes the sweat from her brow. A brief glance around the room reminds her she’s still trapped in the same day.

TREE
(sighing)

Here we go again...

The opening bass-line of a White-Stripes-ish song starts...

BEGIN MONTAGE:

EXT. KAPPA DELTA HOUSE - MORNING

The two KAPPA GIRLS (who were X-ing in the bathroom at Tree’s B-Day party) stare up at the second floor as BOOKS, PAPERS, even a LAPTOP fly out of Tree’s bedroom window.

INT. TREE’S BEDROOM - MORNING

Desk cleared of debris, Tree sits down and begins to jot-down a list of NAMES in a small note-pad. The “suspects” include KEITH, STEPHANIE, DANIELLE, and GREGORY...(But she immediately goes back and crosses off Gregory since he already died in front of her.)

EXT. KEITH’S DORM ROOM - NIGHT

On her tippy-toes, Tree peers through a first-floor window. From her POV we can SEE Keith, already fast-asleep in his over-sized Sponge-Bob pajamas.

Tree looks disappointed as she crosses his name of the top of the list. She turns around and--

--WHAM!

She collides with the masked killer. Looking down, Tree finds the handle of a knife protruding from her stomach.

PRELAP: “Happy Birthday” plays on	Tree’s cell phone.
 
66.


INT. CARTER’S DORM ROOM - MORNING

Already, sitting up in Carter’s bed, Tree grabs her ringing cell phone and makes a perfect basket-toss into Carter’s trash can.

Carter looks at her: crazy bitch.

INT. BATHROM -- TREE’S BEDROOM - MORNING

Tree cuts huge chunks of her hair off (which has already been died a hot shade of bright-pink).

EXT. THE PATIO - AFTERNOON

Danielle and the other Kappa girls stare in horror/disgust as Tree (sporting her new-do) sprays a bottle of Cheeze-Wiz into her open mouth.

EXT. GREGORY’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Gregory escorts Stephanie (he’s in a tux, she’s in a gown) out of their up-scale house.

CLOSE ON -- THE PAD as Stephanie’s name is crossed out.

Gregory’s sedan pulls out of the circular driveway -- Tree is suddenly tackled by her killer! Tree falls backward into a KOI POND. She manages to knock the mask off, but the killer shoves her head UNDERWATER...

Tree’s POV -- through the rippling water, she can’t make out the identity of her attacker.

INT. CARTER’S DORM ROOM - MORNING

Tree wakes up and instantly leans over Carter’s bedside to puke a stream of pond-water.

On Carter: gross!

EXT. THE CAMPUS - MORNING

Shot tastefully, Tree strolls down the thoroughfare COMPLETELY NAKED...

ANGLE ON -- THE STUDYING PAIR as they look up and see Tree. The sprinklers go off but they don’t even react because they’re too stunned.

ANGLE ON -- THE STUDENT PROTESTOR
 
67.


STUDENT PROTESTER
Stop global war--

She sees Tree and pulls her clipboard back.

ANGLE ON -- THE FRAT PLEDGES who follow Tree’s naked body with shocked grins. So distracted are they, nobody notices when the exhausted brother passes-out.

ANGLE ON -- THE STAIRS where Tree crosses paths with Keith. His eyes look like they’re going to shoot out of his head. As Tree streaks by, she winks at him. Keith turns too quickly to follow Tree and loses his footing. He eats shit down the stairs.

EXT. STREET -- ON CAMPUS - AFTERNOON

Tree is walking with Danielle when a student bumps Danielle. A BLACK CARD falls out of her bag. Tree grabs it...it’s just like the one she found in her room earlier. Danielle looks guilty.

Tree attacks her and a cat-fight ensues right there on the street. A few BYSTANDERS try to stop them. Danielle and Tree fall off the sidewalk and onto the street.

We HEAR a HORN blare one long note...

Tree and Danielle both turn as an on-coming BUS speeds toward them. They both scream in unison then -- SPLAT!

INSERT: Tree’s “suspect list” as Tree crosses off Danielle’s name.
