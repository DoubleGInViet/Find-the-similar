EXT. THOROUGHFARE - NIGHT

Tree, donning army fatigues and camo face paint, makes herself small behind a Tree. She waits, clutching a baseball bat, as we HEAR approaching footsteps...

Just as the killer enters her periphery, Tree jumps out and SWINGS!

CRACK!

He goes down. But Tree’s face falls when she realizes it wasn’t the killer. It was just BECKY (her chubby Kappa sister), sneaking onto campus with a box of doughnuts, which are now splayed around her unconscious body.
 
68.


Tree drops the bat and rushes to Becky’s aid. Suddenly, there’s a SNAPPING SOUND behind Tree. She looks over her shoulder and finds the killer hovering over her -- armed with Tree’s own bat!

But instead of screaming, Tree just sighs...

SLOW MOTION: the bat swings in CLOSE-UP and connects with the side of Tree’s SKULL! Continuing with the motion, Tree’s head slowly tilts out of frame and lands on--

--A PILLOW as we

END MONTAGE.

MATCH CUT TO:

INT. CARTER’S DORM ROOM - MORNING

Tree’s HEAD lies on the pillow in the same position. She opens her right-eye, squinting...

Outside, the bell tolls -- wincing in pain, Tree gradually pushes herself up:

TREE
This-is-getting-really-friggin’-
old...

Looking to her right, she sees Carter staring at her.
“Happy Birthday” plays on her phone.

TREE (CONT’D)
I’m fine. Really.

Tree stands. She grabs her phone and dismisses the call from her father.

CARTER
I don’t know if you--

She holds her hand up.

TREE
Carter...sshh. A moment.

Carter nods as Tree shuffles over to his desk and unearths the toiletry bag. She helps herself to his aspirin.
 
69.


CARTER
How did you...

He watches Tree pour 2...3...6 pills into the palm of her hand.

CARTER (CONT’D)
I don’t think you’re supposed to

take that many. You could die.

TREE
If only it were that easy.
(snapping her
fingers)

Water, por-favor.

As Carter retrieves a bottle from his bedside, Tree is already at his door. She pulls it open -- the lanky Freshman is already there but before he can say it...

TREE (CONT’D)
Hi. I’m the so-called “fine-

vagine.

Freshman to Tree -- How the hell did she know he was going to say that?

TREE (CONT’D)
And if that’s the way you refer to girls, then you and your hand are going to have a very lasting relationship.

Tree pushes him back gently.

TREE (CONT’D)
Thanks for stopping by.

And she closes the door in the freshman’s stunned face.

Turning around, Carter is still wearing the same confused look on his face. Tree takes the bottle of water from him and knocks back the pills before chugging down what’s left of the water.

She tosses the empty bottle on the floor and finally acknowledges Carter’s dumbfounded stare.

TREE (CONT’D)
 
What?
 
70.


CARTER
Are you always this charming in

the morning?

TREE
(shit-eating grin)

Just this one.

Tree pulls her T-shirt off. Carter spins around as she starts getting dressed.

CARTER
So...bad dream?

TREE
Sorry?

CARTER
You were screaming before you fell out of bed.

TREE
Oh. I was dying. Again.

Dressed, she turns around.

TREE (CONT’D)
It’s a long story.

CARTER
I’ve got nothing to do.

TREE
Trust me. You’ll think I’m

bonkers.

Tree bends down to grab her shoes and starts to leave.
But the same damn sticker gives her pause.

“TODAY IS THE FIRST DAY OF THE REST OF YOUR LIFE”

Tree turns around...

TREE (CONT’D)
Seriously, I hate this sticker.

INT. HALLWAY -- CARTER’S DORM - CONTINUOUS

Carter catches up with Tree at the stairs.
 
71.


TREE
Why are you following me?

CARTER
I hate when people start something and they don’t finish.

TREE
Look, no offense, but there’s
really no point in explaining any
of it to you. Every time I try, I
end up sounding crazy which, at

this point, I must be.

She reaches the exit.

EXT. THE CAMPUS - CONTINUOUS

Tree puts her shoes on just outside the dorm. Carter is still tailing her.

CARTER
So you’re having bad dreams. I
took an elective course on

neurocognition and dream content.

TREE
Hooray for you.

CARTER
Maybe I can help?

TREE
Can you stop me from re-living the same day, everyday, only to be murdered by someone I may or may not know?

Carter stops. Huh?

TREE (CONT’D)
Thought so.

Tree keeps going. Carter catches up again.

CARTER
You literally think you’re re-

living the same day?

TREE
Yup.
 
72.


CARTER
And somebody kills you?

TREE
Yup again.

They pass the student protestor.

STUDENT PROTESTER
Stop global warming!

She thrusts the clipboard at Tree, who takes it and hands it off to Carter. It stalls him, leaving Carter in Tree’s wake. He has to run and catch up yet again!

CARTER
Come on. You’re just messing with
me, right? You don’t seriously
think you’re re-living the same

day?

Annoyed, Tree stops.

TREE
Car alarm...

CARTER
What?

Just then, the CAR ALARM goes off.

Tree turns, facing the pair studying on the lawn.

TREE
Sprinklers...

She snaps her fingers and the sprinklers go off.

Tree grabs Carter by his shoulders and turns him to face the FRAT PLEDGES.

TREE (CONT’D)
See that pledge over there? The

one with the baseball cap?

She points to the exhausted FRAT PLEDGE.

CARTER
Yeah?
 
73.


TREE
He’s going to pass out right now.

Thump. He goes down on cue. Shocked, Carter slowly turns and looks at Tree.

TREE (CONT’D)
Any further questions?

INT. DAIRY QUEEN - AFTERNOON

Muzak plays softly in the background as Tree noisily sucks down the last drops of her Oreo Blizzard through a straw.

Carter is staring at her, mouth agape.

TREE
Please stop looking at me like I have a dildo stuck to my forehead.

CARTER
Sorry. I’m just trying to work

this whole thing out.

TREE
And how’s that going for you?

CARTER
I guess it’s kinda like that movie “Groundhog’s Day”, only you’re not Bill Murray and instead of zany-fun you’re being violently butchered.

TREE
Well, you’re a nerd. Don’t you
have some scientific theory about

it?

CARTER
First of all, I wouldn’t classify

myself as a nerd.

TREE
Carter, you have a poster of Boba
Fett in your dorm room. You’re a

nerd.
 
74.


CARTER
Whatever. Just because I like
science fiction doesn’t make me an
expert on	crazy chicks trapped in

the same day.

Tree looks down, a little hurt. Carter feels bad.

CARTER (CONT’D)
Look, if I were you I would stop
trying to figure out how it was
happening and start figuring out
why.

TREE
What do you mean?

CARTER
There has to be a reason you’re
stuck in this day. Out of all the
days of your life, this day must

have some kind of meaning.

TREE
But it’s like any other day.

Except the dying part.

Suddenly, Tree’s phone rings -- she looks at her CALLER ID. It’s DAD again. Tree thinks of answering it...but balks.

CARTER
(off the ring-tone)

It’s your birthday?

Tree nods.

CARTER (CONT’D)
Hello?!

TREE
So what? Birthdays are just excuses people make to eat cake and get presents and shit. There’s no real meaning to a birthday.

CARTER
It’s symbolic! Whoever is killing

you knows it’s your birthday!
 
75.


CARTER (CONT’D)
Here --

Carter unfolds a napkin and removes a PEN from his shirt pocket. Tree stares at the pen.

CARTER (CONT’D)
Okay. That’s nerdy. Let’s move on. Who knows it’s your birthday today and who would want to kill you?

TREE
Well, thanks to my sorority sisters, the whole school knows it’s my birthday. They’re going to throw me this stupid surprise party tonight. It could be anyone. At first I thought it was Gregory, but he got killed last night.

CARTER
Who’s Gregory?

TREE
One of my professors. We’ve been

having an affair.

CARTER
Nice.

TREE
Hey, mister “I brought a drunk
girl home and took advantage of

her”. Don’t judge.

CARTER
For the record, I didn’t take
advantage of you. I slept on the

couch.

TREE
(shocked)

We didn’t --

CARTER
No. You were wasted and I was
worried you’d fall or choke on

your own vomit like Janis Joplin.
 
76.


Sitting across from her in the booth, Tree discovers two things about Carter: he’s probably the sweetest guy in the whole world and he’s actually kinda cute.

But she’s not letting her guard down.

TREE
Well...thanks but I would have

been fine.

CARTER
Yeah, I can see that.

Tree manages a laugh. It’s the first time we’ve seen her smile like this.

EXT. THE CAMPUS - AFTERNOON

Carter is walking Tree back to her house. The sun is out, the flowers are in bloom, and if they weren’t talking about Tree dying violently every day, the moment would almost seem romantic.

CARTER
There has to be somebody you

didn’t think of.

TREE
That’s it. Everyone who’d want to

kill me had a solid alibi.

CARTER
But it could be somebody who knows you but you don’t necessarily know them.

TREE
Carter, that’s just dumb. Do you
know how many dozens of people
that could be. I’d spend the rest
of my life dying trying to figure

that out.

Carter snickers.

TREE (CONT’D)
What?

CARTER
You just said you’d have to spend
the rest of your life dying.

(MORE)
 
77.

CARTER (CONT'D)
It was ironic.
(off Tree’s blank
expression)
Get it...”rest of your life
dying”...
(she’s still not
laughing)
Sorry. I’ll shut up now.

They reach Tree’s house. She plops-down on the short wall and releases an exasperated sigh of defeat.

CARTER (CONT’D)
Can I ask you a dumb question?

TREE
Go for it.

CARTER
Why don’t you just leave the

country?

TREE
Oh, you mean like on my private jet? I don’t even have a passport.

CARTER
Look, my parents gave me a credit
card for emergencies. You have a

driver’s license, right?

Tree nods.

CARTER (CONT’D)
That’s it, then. We’ll put you on
a plane. Europe. Mexico. Whatever.
By the time you get there it’ll be
tomorrow. Even if they send you
back cause you don’t have a
passport it’ll still be the next
day. You’ll be home free!

TREE
(genuinely touched)

You’d...do that for me?

CARTER
My parents will freak when they
get the bill but if it means
keeping you alive...yeah. Of

course.
 
78.


PRELAP: A HORN beeping...

INT. CARTER’S VW JETTA - DUSK

Carter and Tree are stuck in a long line of cars trailing back from the interstate on-ramp.

TREE
This is ridiculous. There aren’t
even enough people in this stupid
town to make a traffic jam.
(punching the dash)

God, I hate this day!

Carter clears his throat.

CARTER
So, apart from the obvious
reasons, why are you so down on

your birthday?

TREE
I just think it’s dumb.

He looks at her. He’s not buying that answer.

TREE (CONT’D)
My mom and I were born on the same day.

CARTER
And you’ve had to share it all

your life and it pisses you off?

TREE
No. The opposite. It was always the best day of the year. I’d get to skip school, we’d go to the beach. My dad would get mom and I this big cake. There was always just one candle on it. Dad said it was cause on this one day the greatest people he knew were born.
(she laughs)
Mom said it was cause the cake
would look like a bonfire if both
our ages were on it.

Her smile fades. Carter sees the sadness in Tree’s eyes.
 
79.


CARTER
She died, huh?

Tree nods as she shoves her hurt back down.

TREE
Three years ago. Cancer.

CARTER
Sorry. That sucks.

TREE
Yeah, well...that’s life right?
Everybody dies. Some more than

others.

Inching closer to the on-ramp, Tree suddenly sits up in her seat -- her gaze fixed ahead.

TREE (CONT’D)
Oh my God...

ANGLE ON -- A POLICE OFFICER

Directing the traffic around a small fender-bender, we immediately recognize him as the SAME COP that pulled Tree over before.

TREE (CONT’D)
He died...

CARTER
Who?

TREE
It was my fault. I made it happen.

Tree looks stricken with guilt as she watches the cop, dutifully waving the cars toward the on-ramp -- completely unaware that three cars away, a young girl he’s never even met has seen him die violently.

TREE (CONT’D)
Turn around.

CARTER
What?!

TREE
Take me back!
 
80.


CARTER
Tree, I’m getting you out of here!

Reaching over, Tree grabs the steering wheel.

EXT. HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS

The car behind Carter SLAMS on its breaks as Carter’s car flips a bitch, swerving into oncoming traffic!

Narrowly escaping a major accident, Carter slips into the flow of traffic heading BACK TOWARDS campus.

CLOSE ON -- THE POLICE OFFICER

Shaking his head disapprovingly as he continues to direct cars.

INT. CARTER’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

Checking his rear-view mirror, Carter sighs with a mix of relief and frustration.

CARTER
Are you crazy?!

TREE
Every time I try to run, somebody
dies! Nick, Gregory, that cop! If
I leave who knows how many more

people will die?!

CARTER
So then what?

TREE
I don’t know, okay?! I just...I

don’t know.

Carter turns to look at her. His face is so sympathetic it clams Tree’s frayed nerves like a salve.

Looking ahead, the horizon is ablaze with a crimson glow as the school’s BELL TOWER rises above the woods. Ominous. Foretelling.

TREE (CONT’D)
(softly)
I know one thing...no more
running.
 
81.


INT. 2ND FLOOR HALLWAY -- KAPPA HOUSE - EVENING

A vexed Danielle bumps into Tree as she exits Tree’s room, holding Tree’s blouse.

DANIELLE
Where were you?
(off Tree’s blank
stare)

You ditched our house meeting.

TREE
Danielle, I’m sorry. I’m
just...going through a lot right

now.

DANIELLE
It’s mandatory, Tree. I just finished telling your roommate the same thing. If you guys want to be Kappa sisters you have to stick to the schedule or else you’re out.

TREE
Then I’m out.

Tree yanks her top out of Danielle’s hands and walks off.

Danielle is floored.

DANIELLE
Have fun back in the dorms!

INT. TREE’S BEDROOM - EVENING

Lori is zipping-up a small bag when Tree enters the room. As she flops down on the bed, Tree notices the cupcake sitting on the night stand.

LORI
She just bitch you out too?

TREE
I so could care less.

LORI
You two fighting?

TREE
Danielle and I?
 
82.


LORI
No, you and Gregory. He asked
where you were. Said you didn’t

show up to his class.

TREE
I can’t even think about that

right now.

LORI
I’m off. I have--

TREE
--a double shift. I know.

LORI
(weird)

Right.

Lori starts out the door but stops. Something is on the tip of her tongue...but she chickens-out.

LORI (CONT’D)
See ya later.

TREE
Bye.

Lori leaves. Tree lays back down on her bed. Exhaustion and pain have taken their toll as she easily dozes off.

INT. TREE’S BEDROOM - LATER

Tree wakes up. Looks at the clock...9:19

Danielle bangs on the door before entering in a huff.
She’s all dolled-up sans Tree’s totally cute top.

DANIELLE
Well, it was supposed to be a surprise but since you’re being a total bitch I’ve decided to spoil it. The party at the Sigma house tonight is a surprise birthday party for your ungrateful-ass so I suggest you suck it up and go. Just don’t even try talking to me when you’re there. Got it?
 
83.


Danielle storms out, slamming the door behind her. Instead of getting upset, Tree grabs the cupcake Lori made her and peels-off the paper shell. She’s about to take a bite when...

BLACKOUT.

TREE
(in the dark)

Damn it!

The lights come back on and Tree finds the cupcake resting upside-down on the floor.

TREE (CONT’D)
So much for that.

Tree picks it up and dumps it in the trash. She turns the TV on. The “Road Rules Marathon” is still playing.

TREE (CONT’D)
Oh for god’s sake, enough already!

She changes the channel.

The same LOCAL NEWS REPORT is on. But this time, she’s catching the beginning of the story. Tree instantly recognizes the HOSPITAL in a WIDESHOT -- it’s the one on campus.

REPORTER
I’m standing outside Potsdam University Hospital where suspected murderer Joseph Tombs is being treated for a gunshot wound following a deadly shoot-out this morning that left one officer dead.

Tree slowly rises from her bed as they CUT TO Tombs’ mug-shot.

REPORTER (CONT’D)
Tombs was the subject of a nationwide manhunt that ended after a five month pursuit, across four state lines that left six known female victims.
(MORE)
 
84.

REPORTER (CONT’D)
Authorities are still not sure if Tombs is responsible for the murders of more than a dozen other victims he claims to have buried across the vast deserts of Arizona and New Mexico.

CLOSE ON -- TREE’S STUNNED FACE

TREE
He’s been here this whole time?

FLASHBACK IN TREE’S MIND: Tree is running from Gregory in the hospital. As she passes the room where the OFFICER’S empty chair sat, she catches a split-second glance at the closed door -- in the tiny, glass window we SEE specks of

BLOOD.

BACK ON TREE -- AS SHE REALIZES

TREE (CONT’D)
Oh my god. He’s going to escape...

INT. 4TH FLOOR -- HOSPITAL - NIGHT

The same NURSE is reading her harlequin novel when Tree runs up to her station, startling her.

TREE
He’s going to escape! Call the

police!

NURSE
Who?!

TREE
Joseph Tombs! Just call the cops!

Tree runs down the hall -- she catches a GLIMPSE of the guarding OFFICER as he enters the room!

TREE (CONT’D)
Wait! Don’t go in there!

He didn’t hear her. Tree spots a FIRE AXE mounted on the wall. She retrieves it and approaches Tombs’ room.

Behind her the nurse calls after Tree:

NURSE
Excuse me! What are you doing?
 
85.


Tree ignores her and enters the room.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The first thing Tree sees is the empty hospital bed with a pair of ARM RESTRAINTS dangling from the guard rails.

Moving deeper into the room, Tree discovers the OFFICER’S BODY lying on the other side of the bed. His throat has been slit, his GUN is missing from its holster.

TOMBS (O.C.)
(Southern drawl)
Hey...

Tree turns around and finds her killer standing behind her.

TOMBS (CONT’D)
That’s a pretty big axe you got
there, little girl.

Tombs raises the officer’s stolen handgun. Tree starts to swing the axe -- Tombs fires twice! Both bullets ricochet off the blade, knocking the axe out of Tree’s grip.

Tree: Oh shit.

Tree bolts for the door! Tombs goes after her!

INT. 4TH FLOOR -- HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS

Running out the door, Tree slams into the nurse.

NURSE
What are you--

TREE
Run!

Tree tries to grab her but the nurse pauses to peer into the room.

BAM-BAM-BAM!

Three rapid-fire shots take the nurse down. Tree screams and runs for the elevators. She sees another NURSE in the hall -- she bolts for the elevator. By the time Tree reaches her, the elevator doors are already closing!
 
86.


TREE (CONT’D)
WAIT!

Too late! The doors close on Tree. Tombs rounds the corner. Tree is trapped in the small reception area. He laughs -- cold-blooded and mocking.

Backed against the elevator doors, Tree watches helplessly as Tombs advances, gun raised and ready to fire!

Suddenly, Carter appears BEHIND Tombs. He tackles Tombs -- the gun goes off twice before falling from his grip!

Tree is quick to grab the gun. She aims at Tombs and fires!

CLICK...

Tree’s eyes widen in horror. It’s empty.

Without missing a beat, Tombs pulls a hunting knife tucked away and drives the blade into Carter!

TREE (CONT’D)
Carter!!!

He’s dead. Tree backpedals away from the elevator as Tombs rises to his feet.

Tree turns and runs down another CORRIDOR. It dead-ends at a door marked “STAIRS”.

INT. STAIRWELL -- BELL TOWER - CONTINUOUS

Assuming it was another fire-exit, Tree discovers the stairs only go up...

...toward the BELL TOWER.

Tombs bursts through the door!

Tree races up the wooden steps of this small, cramped stairwell (metal candle holders line the wall) -- Tombs is close behind! He lunges --

-- when Tree reaches back and KICKS him hard in the gut!

He slips back a few steps! She kicks him again -- square in the face, shattering part of the mask -- exposing half of Tombs demented grin.
 
87.


Catching her ankle, he yanks her hard and she nearly tumbles atop him!

Tree’s kicking at him, but his grip is iron clad.

Tombs snaps a metal candle stick from the wall -- prepared to stab her with the jagged metal edge! He brings it down hard, Tree dodges the blow as the pointed edge jams into the soft wood of the stair!

Tree seizes the moment and CLAWS his face as hard she can. Tombs screams in agony! Wriggling out from under him, Tree clamors for the entrance to the bell tower.

INT. BELL TOWER - CONTINUOUS

Moments later, Tombs steps into the loft.

He looks, where could she have gone? There’s no way out.

Tree is standing on the railing.

He’s confused. She’s three flights up.

He notices the rope leading from the bell tower...

...is tied around her neck.

She turns, glares him in the eye.

TREE
See you tomorrow, asshole.

She leaps!

In mid-air, the rope pulls taught! The bell rings out as we...

SLAM CUT:

INT. CARTER’S DORM ROOM - MORNING

Outside, the bell is still tolling as Tree’s eyes snap open. She sucks in a breath of air and exhales with a wheeze. Tree looks pale -- we don’t know how many more “lives” she’s got left.

But her eyes are filled with purpose. She knows who her killer is and she’s not afraid anymore.

Tree sits up and sees Carter staring at her.
 
88.


CARTER
You’re up. I wasn’t --

Weak but elated to see him alive, Tree jumps out of bed and throws her arms around Carter.

TREE
Thank you! I can’t believe you

tried to save me!

Carter’s body is rigid in Tree’s awkward embrace. He finally pats her back cordially.

CARTER
No biggie.

She pulls away as her cell phone plays “Happy Birthday”. By the time she retrieves it, she’s missed her dad’s call.

TREE
Damn it.

Tree pulls her T-shirt off. Carter spins around.

CARTER
I don’t know if you remember my

name --

TREE
Carter.

He looks surprised. Tree grabs a pillow from his bed.

TREE (CONT’D)
Can I borrow this?

CARTER
Uh...sure. Why not?

TREE
Thanks.

She pecks him on the cheek.

TREE (CONT’D)
See you at lunch.

Now he’s really confused but before he can even ask she’s already starting out the door. The freshman is just arriving. As she passes him, Tree SLAPS his ass.
 
89.


The freshman looks at Carter -- WTF?

Cue a hot song with a nice beat...

EXT. THE CAMPUS - MORNING

A walk of shame no more, Tree ditches her heels and chucks them in the bushes before strutting down the main thoroughfare.

Sun in her eyes, Tree casually snatches a pair of SUNGLASSES off a passerby and puts them on. He spins around and watches Tree keep going, too shocked to protest.

She comes across the PROTESTER...

STUDENT PROTESTER
Stop global--

Tree grabs the clipboard out of her hand and signs the petition. She shoves it back into the protester’s hands, adding:

TREE
I love Al Gore.

Next stop, the frat pledges...

FRAT PLEDGES
--	not a Willie or a Sam! I’m the eighth ole’ man named Henry! Henry the Eighth, I am!

FRAT BROTHER
Second verse, same as the first!

FRAT PLEDGES
Oh, Henry the Eighth, I am, I
am!...

The EXHAUSTED FRAT PLEDGE starts to go down, but his fall is broken by Tree. She gently lays him down and sticks the pillow under his head. He’s already out like a light as Tree plants a kiss on his forehead.

A hush has fallen over the cheering crowd of onlookers. Tree doesn’t pay any attention to them as she keeps going.
 
90.


Reaching the end of the quad, Tree starts down the steps.

She sees Keith up ahead and waves to him.

TREE
Morning Keith!

He almost has a heart attack as she gives him a bear hug.

TREE (CONT’D)
Have a great day.

KEITH
Thanks?

As he watches Tree go, his confused expression yields to a smitten grin.

INT. KAPPA DELTA HOUSE - MORNING

Starting up the stairs, Tree is accosted by Danielle.

DANIELLE
Oh-my-god. You sneaky beeyotch!

Tree turns around.

TREE
(rapid-fire)
His name’s Carter. We didn’t have
sex. But I think if I get through
this, I might have his children.

Lots to do. Gotta go.

Tree’s really racking-up the baffled expressions today.

INT. TREE’S BEDROOM - MORNING

Dressed and ready for the biggest day of her life, Tree smiles as Lori exits the bathroom.

LORI
She finally rolls-in.

TREE
Lori, I’m late for class but I
wanted to say that I’m sorry for
being such a shitty roommate. I
know you’ve been seeing somebody
and you couldn’t even talk about
it with me and that’s wrong. I
should have been there for you.
(MORE)
 
91.

TREE (CONT'D)
But I want to change that.

Starting today.

LORI
Are you okay?

Tree smiles.

TREE
Never better.

INT. DR. BUTLER’S SCIENCE CLASS - MORNING

Late for class, Tree enters the lecture hall. The door squeaks open, drawing everyone’s attention -- including Gregory’s as he turns from the chalkboard.

Only Tree doesn’t sit down.

TREE
Dr. Butler...a word please?

INT. HALLWAY -- OUTSIDE GREGORY’S CLASS - MOMENTS LATER

Tree is already waiting outside as Gregory practically explodes out of the lecture hall.

GREGORY
What the hell do you think you’re

doing?!

TREE
Ending this.

GREGORY
Wait. What?

TREE
I wish I’d never started seeing you. It was wrong. Anyway, I can’t change that. But I can start doing the right thing today.

Gregory laughs -- it’s smug and condescending.

GREGORY
What lame self-help book did that

come from?

TREE
You know something, you have a
wife who really loves you.

(MORE)
 
92.

TREE (CONT'D)
If you can’t be committed to her

then have the balls to leave her.

That shut him up. Tree starts off.

GREGORY
(shouting after her)
Don’t expect me to let you coast-

by in my class now!

TREE
(laughing)

I already dropped it!

She flips him the bird before disappearing out the door.

EXT. LUNCH PATIO - AFTERNOON

The Kappa lunch meeting is in full swing. Danielle is holding court when she sees Tree approach the table with a tray FULL of junk food. She sets it down and instantly dives-into a wedge of cheesecake. Everyone is staring at her like she’s a leper.

TREE
(mouth-full)
This is totally amazing.

Becky arrives with her tray -- including a sandwich, pasta salad, and the notorious glass of chocolate milk. As she sits down...

DANIELLE
Did I miss the memo?

BECKY
Sorry?

DANIELLE
What’s up with the fat-fest? We’re

Kappa’s.

Tree shoves her plate of cheesecake toward Danielle.

TREE
Live a little, hon. A few calories won’t kill you.

DANIELLE
No, they’ll just turn me into a

chunker like Becky here.
 
93.


Becky looks like she’s going to die. She starts to get up with her tray of food. She doesn’t see Carter coming.

SMASH!

They collide. Only this time, Tree’s ready as she nimbly ducks out of the way. Becky’s chocolate milk flies off the tray and splashes all over Danielle!

Tree cracks up!

CARTER
Oh my god! I’m so sorry!

TREE
Don’t be. That was perfect.

Becky starts laughing with Tree. Danielle gets up. As more people see her dripping wet they start laughing too.

DANIELLE
Shut up!

Her tantrum only makes them laugh harder. Bursting into tears, Danielle runs off with some of her Kappa cronies chasing after her.

CARTER
I didn’t mean to--

Tree grabs him and plants a big kiss on his lips. She finally pulls away. Carter’s eyes are as wide as saucers.

CARTER (CONT’D)
What was that for?

“Happy Birthday” starts playing again on Tree’s cell phone. It’s dad again.

TREE
Look, I have to run but what are

you up to tonight?

CARTER
Um...nothing.

TREE
Would you like to take me out for

my birthday?
 
94.


CARTER
Okay. What’s the punch-line?

TREE
I’m being serious. I know it’s kinda random but I’ll explain everything tomorrow assuming there is one. Just say yes.

CARTER
Yes?

Tree pecks him on the cheek. As she heads off, Carter looks at Becky -- they both share confused grins.

INT. RESTAURANT - AFTERNOON

Tree’s dad, DAVID (late 40’s, distinguished), sits in the half-empty restaurant -- an empty coffee cup in front of him.

He looks at his watch with a sigh before waving the WAITRESS over to his table.

DAVID
Can I pay for my coffee?

WAITRESS
You’re not going to eat, honey?

DAVID
No. Thanks. Just the check.

The waitress leaves. David fishes out his wallet and removes a ten. But when he looks up, he finds Tree standing there.

TREE
Hi, daddy. Sorry I’m late.

Tree takes a seat across from him. She can tell he’s hurt.

TREE (CONT’D)
You look nice. I like the tie.

David looks down at his tie.

DAVID
Thanks.
 
95.


An uncomfortable silence fills the air. Tree looks down, ashamed she’s let the distance between them get this far.

DAVID (CONT’D)
How’s school?

TREE
It’s fine. Dad, I don’t want to do that anymore.

DAVID
Do what?

TREE
You know...small talk.

David looks surprised by her forthrightness.

TREE (CONT’D)
This day...it’s so hard. I miss
her so much. And I thought if I
just avoided it -- and you, it’d
be easier. But it’s worse. All
this running and hiding has made
me so unhappy. I think I finally
figured it out. It took something
crazy for me to get it. But I’m
here and I love you and--
(she chokes up)

I’m so sorry for hurting you.

Tree’s dad looks visibly moved. Tree wipes her own tears away. David takes her hand and kisses it.

DAVID
Happy Birthday, baby.

TREE
Thanks daddy.

NEW SHOT -- FROM ACROSS THE ROOM

We SEE Tree and David engaged in conversation. Picking-up where they left off three years ago.

INT. TREE’S BEDROOM - EVENING

We’re CLOSE ON a chef’s KNIFE as Tree slides it into the back of her jeans before hiding the handle with a tight T-shirt.
 
96.


Pulling her hair back into a pony tail, she glances at her reflection in the mirror. Her eyes say all we need to know...she’s ready to take control of her destiny.

Teresa Gelbman is going to make it to Wednesday, the 19th.

Even if it kills her.

INT. 4TH FLOOR -- HOSPITAL - NIGHT

We follow Lori as she comes down the hall -- she passes the nurse’s station where our hopeless romantic (the same nurse every night) has her face buried in the harlequin novel.

LORI
Deena, I’m taking my break. Back

in a few.

The nurse doesn’t look up. She just answers with a “K”.

Lori steps into the elevator. As the doors close, we see the adjacent doors open revealing Tree.

Our heroine slips by the nurse’s station. Much to her relief, she finds the OFFICER just sitting down outside Tomb’s room with his hot cup of coffee.

Tree quietly approaches him. He looks up at her, surprised.

POLICE OFFICER
Help you?

Tree brings a finger to her mouth, shushing him.

TREE
(whispering)
This is going to sound crazy, but
Joseph Tombs is going to escape

tonight.

POLICE OFFICER
(you crazy?)

Come again?

TREE
Please. Just check on him.
 
97.


POLICE OFFICER
Look, I don’t know who you are,
missy, but you better turn around
and high-tail it out of here

before I have you thrown out.

He doesn’t even see it coming. Tree has the blade at his throat before the officer can get the gun from his holster.

TREE
I’m really sorry but you’re just
gonna have to do what I say right

now.

POLICE OFFICER
(scared)

Okay. Take it easy. Take it easy.

TREE
Now stand up very slowly.

He does as he’s told.

POLICE OFFICER
This is a real bad idea.

TREE
So’s getting killed for the sixth

time. Open the door.



INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Guiding the officer into the room, Tree’s relieved to find Tomb’s still asleep in his bed.

POLICE OFFICER
See? Safe and sound.

She nudges the officer closer.

POLICE OFFICER (CONT’D)
Look, he’s not--

TREE
Shoot him.

POLICE OFFICER
What?!
 
98.


TREE
Shoot him in the head.

They both don’t see Tomb’s eyes slowly open...

POLICE OFFICER
Girly, you are out of your

freakin’ mind!

CLOSE ON -- TOMB’S ARM RESTRAINTS

His wrists are just resting in them but the straps are already UNDONE.

TREE
He’s going to kill me! Shoot him!

Tombs suddenly LUNGES at the cop and shoves the knife he was hiding into the police officer’s stomach!

Tree staggers back as Tombs rises from his bed. He picks up the MASK sitting on the table beside his bed.

Tree grabs the fallen officer’s GUN! She aims it at Tombs and squeezes the trigger! Nothing happens!

TOMBS
The safety’s still on little
girl...

The blood covered Tombs throws his full weight atop her! She goes down hard -- shattering a rib! The gun sails across the room from the impact!

He drops the knife, climbing atop her, choking her with his bare hands!

TOMBS (CONT’D)
I should cut off your head and be
done with it... but this feels so

much better, no?

But this isn’t the weak and defenseless Tree who has been killed again and again. She focuses --

--	and drives her open palm hard into his nose! He cries out in pain. Tree tries to run but he grabs her by her shirt and throws her across the room! Tree hits the wall like a rag doll.
 
99.


Tombs retrieves the knife and slowly stalks over to Tree.

She’s in too much pain to move.

He he stands above her, the knife in the air. Tombs flashes a sadistic grin.

But he’s surprised...

...when she smiles back?!

9:23.	Blackout.

Moments pass.

The lights come back on.

He is surprised that Tree... is gone?!

TREE
Psst.

No, not gone. She took advantage of the blackout to scramble a few feet away and pick up the gun.

TREE (CONT’D)
Thanks for the tip.

...and as he lunges at her, knife in hand...

...she empties the gun into his chest!

Tombs falls back onto the bed, a bloody mess. DEAD.

We HOLD ON Tree -- exhausted but still alive. A victim no-more.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. KAPPA DELTA HOUSE - NIGHT

The police have gone, the ordeal is finally over. Carter is walking Tree to her house.

CARTER
So this has to be strangest

birthday you’ve ever had.

TREE
You have no idea.
 
100.


CARTER
Did the police say how Tombs got

free?

TREE
They really don’t know.

CARTER
Like Houdini.

TREE
I guess.

They stop outside her front door.

TREE (CONT’D)
So, sorry our little date didn’t

happen.

CARTER
It’s okay. There’s always

tomorrow.

Tree glances at her watch. It’s 11:53 pm.

TREE
(under her breath)
I hope so.

She kisses him.

TREE (CONT’D)
Good night.

CARTER
Night.

She goes inside. Carter lingers for a moment, totally smitten.

INT. TREE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Tree’s a little surprised to find the room empty. Lori must be out with her “new man”.

But she left something behind...

THE CUPCAKE.

Tree grabs a book of matches sitting on a box of incense.

She lights the candle on the cupcake.
 
101.


Sitting down on her bed, Tree closes her eyes. Thinking of a wish.

Love? Money? Fame?

Doesn’t matter. She’s alive.

Tree opens her eyes and blows.

CLOSE ON -- THE WICK

As the flame is extinguished by Tree’s breath we are plunged into DARKNESS.

SLAM CUT:

THREE BEATS OF DARKNESS MAKE US THINK OUR STORY HAS ENDED BUT...

THE TOWER BELL TOLLS THE HOUR...

Tree’s eyes flutter open. She’s a little groggy. Pushing herself up, her eyes suddenly fill with an unspeakable horror!

INT. CARTER’S DORM ROOM - MORNING

Carter is putting something under the couch when he notices Tree sitting up in his bed. He smiles.

CARTER
You’re up. I wasn’t --

TREE
Carter...

CARTER
I didn’t think you’d remember my
name. You were pretty wasted last

night.

Tree’s cell phone plays “Happy Birthday”. She grabs the phone...the caller ID says “DAD”.

TREE
No...this can’t happening! This

can’t be happening!

She jumps out of bed.
 
102.


TREE (CONT’D)
I killed him!

CARTER
(alarmed)

Who? What are you talking about?

She pulls her T-shirt off. Carter spins around.

CARTER (CONT’D)
You probably just had a bad dream. It happens to me whenever I drink too much.

But when he turns around, Tree’s already gone. He frowns.

CARTER (CONT’D)
(to himself)

Nice one, dickweed.

EXT. THE CAMPUS - MORNING

Tears streaking down her cheeks, Tree runs past everything familiar. Nothing has changed. She’s trapped in the same day forever...

INT. TREE’S BEDROOM - MORNING

We can HEAR the shower running through the bathroom door as a border-line hysterical Tree enters.

She immediately begins pulling clothes from her drawer and tossing them on the bed.

The water stops as Lori emerges from the bathroom wrapped in a towel.

LORI
Oh. She’s finally back.

Lori notices the pile of clothes building on Tree’s bed.

LORI (CONT’D)
Going somewhere?

TREE
Yes! As far away as possible!

LORI
What’s wrong?
 
103.


TREE
What’s wrong?! I’ll tell you
what’s wrong! Me! I was wrong! I
thought if I stopped running I
could beat it! But it’s never
going to stop! So I’ll run! I’ll
run to the end of the god-damn
earth if I have to!

LORI
Tree, you’re freaking me out.

TREE
Oh well! That’s me! A freak!

Tree yanks the closet open, searching for something.

LORI
Tree, look...

She turns around. Lori’s holding the cupcake she made for Tree.

LORI (CONT’D)
Happy Birthday.

TREE
(sarcastic)
Thanks, but I already ate it last

night--

Tree freezes. Last night...

She turns around to face her roommate -- her eyes locked on the cupcake.

TREE (CONT’D)
I died in my sleep.

LORI
What?

TREE
You...killed me.

Lori slowly sets the cupcake down on Tree’s desk.

TREE (CONT’D)
(working it out;
aloud)

(MORE)
 
104.

TREE (CONT’D)
It was poisoned. But I never ate
it before.

FLASH: We SEE Tree throwing the cupcake in the trash -- then dropping it on the floor after the black out.

TREE (CONT’D)
So you had to find another way.
Then Tombs fell right into your
lap...the perfect scapegoat.

FLASH: Tombs is rolled past Lori on a gurney. She follows him with narrowed eyes as a plot is hatched in her mind.

TREE (CONT’D)
You had access to him. Did you
drug him first?

FLASH: Lori jams a hypordermic needle in Tombs’ arm. While he’s unconscious, she changes him into “The Killer’s Outfit”. She puts the MASK on his face and sets the HUNTER’S KNIFE at his side. As she slips out of the room, we SEE his wrists are no longer restrained.

TREE (CONT’D)
You knew he’d wake up and escape.
Then they’d just assume he killed
me.

FLASH: Tree’s FIRST DEATH. The masked killer stabs her from behind.

TREE (CONT’D)
But it was always you...

FLASH: The killer pulls-up his mask REVEALING Lori’s satisfied/hateful expression as she looks down on Tree’s lifeless body in the ditch.

BACK TO TREE’S BEDROOM:

Lori’s stunned expression yields to a sardonic laugh.

LORI
You’ve totally lost your mind. You actually think I’d try to poison you with a friggin’ cupcake?

TREE
Prove it.

Tree nods to the cupcake.
 
105.


TREE (CONT’D)
Have a bite.

Lori hesitates. Tree picks it up.

TREE (CONT’D)
Go ahead...

LORI
You really are nuts.

TREE
Fine. I’ll just take it to the police. I’m sure they can see what your little birthday treat is made of.

Lori’s expression falls. As Tree turns, Lori grabs Tree by the hair! The cupcake falls on the desk! Lori swings Tree into the wall! Tree hits the ground, dazed.

Lori slams the bedroom door shut and locks it. Blocking the door, she looks down on Tree.

LORI
(with venom)
You stupid little whore.

TREE
Why?..

LORI
Oh, I don’t know. Maybe because
you wouldn’t stop sleeping with

him.

TREE
Gregory?

LORI
But he kept choosing you over me.
Guess all he really wanted was a
cheap slut like you. But what I
want to know is...how did you

figure it out?

TREE
You’ve killed me before.
 
106.


LORI
Then I guess I’ll just have to do

it again.

Tree runs for the window but Lori tackles her! She flips Tree over. Grabbing her by the hair, Lori begins BASHING her head against the floor.

Suddenly, there’s a loud KNOCK at the door...

Lori stops for a second and immediately covers Tree’s mouth with her hand.

DANIELLE (O.S.)
What the hell’s going on in there?

LORI
Everything’s fine...Tree just

fell. She’s okay.

In her peripheral, Tree SPOTS the up-turned cupcake lying on the desk -- just an arm’s length away...

Lori suddenly becomes aware of Tree grabbing the cupcake. With her other hand, Tree PUNCHES Lori in the throat!

Lori gasps for air!

TREE
Eat it, bitch!

And Tree crams the cupcake into Lori’s open mouth!

As Lori struggles to spit the cake out, Tree SLUGS her again, knocking Lori off.

Tree gets to her feet fast. Lori rises, spitting the last bits out.

LORI
Oh, you’re dead now...

Looking up, Tree spies a built-in BOOKSHELF over the window where Lori is standing.

With the last of her strength, Tree JUMPS UP and catches the shelf with both hands then KICKS Lori through the window!
 
107.


EXT. KAPPA DELTA HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Glass and wood EXPLODE as Lori sails though the window! Her body bounces off the ledge, before flipping over backwards!

There’s a skull-crushing THUD as Lori hits the stone walkway two-stories below.

INT. TREE’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Danielle’s door-pounding has intensified with all the commotion.

DANIELLE (O.S.)
What the hell was that?

ANGLE ON TREE -- BATTERED AND FADING

TREE
(winded)

Lori...ate...my birthday cupcake.

We can HEAR some of the sorority sister’s SCREAMS outside as Tree’s eyes roll back into her head and she passes out cold.

FADE IN:

EXT.	POTSDAM UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL - MORNING

It is a beautiful, sunny morning.

Half a dozen LOCAL and NATIONAL NEWS VANS parked out front, all covering the story of the day.

INT.	INTENSIVE CARE WARD - MORNING

Tree wakes up in the hospital bed. Beside her is Carter and her dad.

TREE
What... day is it?

DAVID
Wednesday, you slept all night.

TREE
Wednesday?	The nineteenth?
 
108.


DAVID
That’s right.

TREE
(relieved)

I made it.

She smiles... starts to get up, but can’t.

CARTER
You’re not supposed to move.

You’ve been banged up pretty bad.

She lets them lower her back down.

CARTER (CONT’D)
Do you remember anything?

TREE
Lori? She’s dead?

He shakes his head.

DAVID
The police know everything. They

found her journal.

She takes Carter’s hand. Then her Dad’s. Tree is grateful. Just then, Dr. Winter appears.

DR. WINTER
She needs her rest. You can visit

her later.

DAD
I love you.

TREE
I love you, too.

As dad starts off, Carter steals a little kiss, adding:

CARTER
You still owe me a date.

Tree smiles.

They leave.	Alone with Dr. Winter: Tree winces.

TREE
Can I get something for the pain?
 
109.


DR. WINTER
In your condition, I’m afraid anything I would prescribe could be dangerous. You might need to put up with some pain for a day -- can you do that?

Tree smiles.

TREE
I can handle one day. Believe me.

Dr. Winter excuses himself.

Tree closes her eyes, soaking in the sunlight of this new day, pouring through the window --

-- when she’s suddenly aware of a shadow over her.

She sees the silhouette of a nurse standing over her.
The woman is preparing a syringe.

Tree raises her hand to try to get a look at the nurse.

TREE (CONT’D)
Excuse me.	What are you doing?

NURSE
It’s for the pain.

The nurse brings the syringe to the I.V. tube.

TREE
But... the doctor said no.

The nurse steps closer...

It’s Stephanie -- Gregory’s wife.

STEPHANIE
Not your pain, Teresa. Mine. Did
you think you’d get away with

screwing my husband?

Stephanie empties the syringe in the intravenous.

TREE
You’ve got to be kidding me.
 
110.


...whispers Tree, even as she begins to convulse...

SLAM CUT:

END CREDITS



*ALTERNATE ENDING*

INT. CARTER’S DORM ROOM - MORNING

The bell tolls outside. Tree stirs from her slumber. She sits up...notices she’s wearing the same oversized T-shirt.

TREE
No...

She spies Carter -- bent over, in front of the couch putting something away.

Tree’s eyes go wide with shock as her cell phone plays “Happy Birthday”. She grabs it...

CLOSE ON -- THE LCD SCREEN

It says: PRIVATE NUMBER

Tree: What?

Carter turns around, holding his cell phone. He laughs as he snaps it shut. Tree’s cell phone instantly stops ringing as she realizes he was just fucking with her.

TREE (CONT’D)
You think that’s funny?!

CARTER
Hilarious.

Grabbing a pillow, Tree takes a swing and misses. Carter tackles Tree onto the bed. Pinning her down, he goes in for the kiss...

But Tree suddenly pushes him back -- she looks worried.

CARTER (CONT’D)
What’s wrong?
 
111.


TREE
What if I get stuck in this day?

Carter kisses her. It’s passionate but tempered with sweetness. He pulls away. A smiles breaks through Tree’s anxiety.

TREE (CONT’D)
I guess I could live with that.

Tree grabs Carter’s head and pulls him into another kiss.

Cue love-song that makes teenage girls prematurely ovulate as we PULL AWAY from our lovebirds...

EXT. HOSPITAL BELL TOWER - MORNING

The bell rings one last time as the sun rises over the Potsdam University campus -- its incandescent light finally keeping its promise of tomorrow.
