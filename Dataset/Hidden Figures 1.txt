In darkness, the voice of a little girl.	Counting.

LITTLE GIRL (V.O.)
14, 15, 16...prime.	18, prime.

EXT. TREE LINED PATH - DAY

A pair of little feet navigates down a gravel path. Kicking a pine cone.

LITTLE GIRL (O.S.)
20, 21, 22, prime, 24, 25, 26...

Pulling up, we reveal: KATHERINE COLEMAN (8,) a peculiar, quiet, mouse of a child, wearing glasses bigger than her bookish face. Counting to herself.

A VOICE (her Mother’s) in the distance hollers out:

JOYLETTE COLEMAN (O.S.)
Katherine!	Come on now!

Katherine looks up. Sees a car stopped at the end of the path. She runs off. Counting all the way.

Titles over: White Sulphur Springs, Virginia - 1926

EXT. WHITE SULPHUR SPRINGS GRAMMAR SCHOOL - DAY

A “colored” grammar school. Small, spirited. Katherine’s now between her parents (dad: JOSHUA and JOYLETTE,) holding their hands as they enter.

INT. WHITE SULPHUR SPRINGS GRAMMAR SCHOOL - DAY - CONT.

A long hallway lined with windows. Sitting on a bench, outside a Principal’s office, Katherine sketches (in a small notebook) the window panes, highlighting all the geometric shapes she discovers within:

KATHERINE (@8 YEARS OLD) Isosceles, scalene, obtuse, equilateral, rhombus...

On the windows opposite her: the tetris-like patterns of her mind’s eye come alive.

KATHERINE (@8 YEARS OLD) (CONT’D) Trapezoid, tetrahedron, octahedron, dodecahedron...

And on she goes.

INT. PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Katherine’s parents sit across from the school’s principal, MR. MARION SMITHSON and Katherine’s teacher, MS. SUMNER.

MARION SMITHSON
West Virginia Collegiate Institute is the best school for Negros in the state.

MS. SUMNER
It’s the only school, past the eighth grade, anywhere close to here.

JOSHUA COLEMAN
Katherine’s in the sixth grade.

MS. SUMNER
They want to take her early.

MARION SMITHSON
They’re offering a full scholarship. All you have to do is get there.

Joshua and Joylette are overwhelmed. They grasp each other’s hands.

MS. SUMNER
Joshua, Joylette...we took up a collection amongst the teachers and such, a few parents.

Ms. Sumner hands Joylette an envelope.

MS. SUMNER (CONT’D)
It’s not a whole lot, but it’ll surely help get you settled in.

Joylette accepts the envelope.

JOYLETTE COLEMAN
That’s beyond kind, Ms. Sumner.

MS. SUMNER
In all my years of teaching, I’ve never seen a mind like the one your daughter has. You have to go. You have to see what she becomes.

Joylette starts to tear. The kindness of people. Joshua puts his arm around his wife.

EXT. ROAD - INSTITUTE, VIRGINIA - DAY

The Coleman family car, hauling a trailer with all their belongings, drives past a pasture dotted with COWS. A road sign reads: Welcome to Institute, Virginia.

INT. COLEMAN FAMILY CAR - DRIVING - DAY - CONTINUOUS

Katherine’s crowded in the back seat with her siblings (CHARLES, MARGARET and HORACE.) She stares out the window, studying the cows whizzing by, the patterns on their hides forming shapes in her mind. She studies the shapes, only now she’s...

INT. WEST VIRGINIA COLLEGIATE INSTITUTE - ANOTHER DAY

...staring out another window in a new classroom. A fancy classroom in a prestigious academy. The class is full of OLDER STUDENTS dressed in the best they have.

Unbeknownst to Katherine, her new teacher, PROFESSOR GRAVES, is standing right in front of her.

PROFESSOR GRAVES
Ms. Coleman.

Katherine whips back to reality.	Embarrassed.

PROFESSOR GRAVES (CONT’D) You find something out there more interesting than quadratic equations?

KATHERINE (@8 YEARS OLD)
Yes, sir.	I mean no, sir.

Professor Graves holds out a piece of chalk.

PROFESSOR GRAVES
Why don’t you figure out the equation on the board?

Katherine looks at the chalkboard.	The equation looks Greek:
symbols, signs, parentheticals.

Professor Graves pushes the chalk closer.

PROFESSOR GRAVES (CONT’D)
Go on.

Katherine takes the chalk. Stands. Walks sheepishly to the front of the class. Every eye on her.
 




(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

She stands in front of the blackboard, the equation. Studies it for the longest time. Inspecting every number, sign, symbol. Wheels churning.

Then she starts to write.	Slow and meticulous at first.
Then fast.	Faster.	With passion and fury.

The Students crane their heads.

Professor Graves rubs his temple.

And Katherine writes on, chalk dust dropping like snow from her chalk stick. On and on and on...until she’s at the very bottom, far side of the board. She circles the answer.

Stands and faces the class. The equation behind her dwarfing her in stature. She clears her throat...

KATHERINE (@8 YEARS OLD)
If the product of two terms is zero, then common sense says at least one of the two terms has to be zero to start with. So, if you move all the terms over to one side, you can put the quadratics into a form that can be factored, allowing that side of the equation to equal zero. Once you’ve done that, it’s pretty straight forward from there...

You can hear a pin drop. There’s nothing to say. Katherine shuffles. Adjusts her glasses.

KATHERINE (@8 YEARS OLD) (CONT’D)
...sir.

Katherine walks back to her desk. We push in on the equation. The numbers. The endless, endless numbers. The title fades up:

Hidden Figures

EXT. ROAD - DAY

We float down towards a lone stretch of road in the middle of nowhere. Infinity in all directions.

A 1955 Chevy Impala sits on the shoulder, the hood up.

THE CAR - DAY - CONTINUOUS

KATHERINE GOBLE (now 38) sits in the passenger seat, staring out the window. Up into space.

A holler crashes the silence:

DOROTHY (O.S.)
Try and turn it over!

Outside, a pair of legs poke out from under the car.

DOROTHY (O.S.) (CONT’D)
Katherine?!

DOROTHY VAUGHAN (40s) slides out from under the car. No-nonsense, brilliant, tough, mechanically gifted.

DOROTHY (CONT’D)
Mary!?

At the back of the car, sitting on the trunk, we find MARY JACKSON (30ish) putting on lipstick. Mary’s a spirited beauty, free-tongued, unbridled.

MARY
Katherine!?	Quit staring off into space!
Turn the damn car over!

Mary bangs on the rear window. Katherine snaps out of her trance.

KATHERINE
I got it.	I’m not deaf.

MARY
I wonder some times.

Katherine slides over to the driver’s seat.	Pumps the gas.
Stamps the pedal to the floor.

KATHERINE
Here it goes.

She turns the key in the ignition. Click, click, click. The engine whines, the car doesn’t start.

DOROTHY
That’s the starter. It’s definitely the starter.

MARY
That starter’s startin’ to make us late. We’re all gonna be unemployed driving this hunk of junk to work everyday.

DOROTHY
You’re welcome to walk the 16 miles.

KATHERINE
Or sit on the back of the bus.

MARY
Won’t do neither.	I’ll hitchhike.

Mary models her hitchhiking thumb, pose.

Just then, far in the distance, Mary sees a POLICE CAR coming over the hill...

MARY (CONT’D)
Girls.

Dorothy and Katherine look.	See the car coming up fast.

DOROTHY
No crime in a broken down car.

MARY
No crime being Negro either.

Katherine gets out of the car.	Dorothy stands up.

KATHERINE
Button it up, Mary. No one wants to go to jail behind your mouth.

MARY
I’ll do my best, sugar.

The police car stops behind them. And the gruffest WHITE COP steps out. Walks toward them. Silent. Then...

WHITE COP
Not a great place for the three of ya’ll to be havin’ car trouble.

Mary can’t help herself.

MARY
We didn’t pick the place, Officer. It picked us.

The White Cop steps into Mary.	Not interested in talk back.

WHITE COP
You bein’ disrespectful?

Mary shakes her head.

MARY
No, sir.

WHITE COP
You have identification on ya?

Katherine jumps in.

KATHERINE
We sure do. We’re just on our way to work. At Langley.

Katherine pulls out her NASA ID badge. Holds it up for him to see.

KATHERINE (CONT’D)
NASA, sir.

Dorothy specifies, holds up her NASA badge.

DOROTHY
We do a great deal of the calculating getting our rockets into space.

He turns his attention back to Mary.

WHITE COP
All three of ya?

Mary pulls out her NASA badge.

MARY
Yes, Officer.

Hmm.	He takes Mary’s badge.	Studies it.	Inspects the back.
It’s official.

WHITE COP
NASA. That’s somethin’. Had no idea they hired-

He stops himself from saying “coloreds.”	Or worse.

DOROTHY
There are quite a few women working in the Space Program, sir.

She saves him the embarrassment.	He looks toward the sky.
Paranoid.

WHITE COP
Damn Russians are watching us right now.

Sputniks.

His wheels turn.	Shifting gears.

Mary lies through her teeth:

MARY
Absolutely.

WHITE COP

KATHERINE
We work with those gentlemen all the time.

The White Cop gets patriotic.

WHITE COP
Those boys are the best we got. That’s for sure. We have-ta get a man up there before the Commies do. Whole damn country’s counting on ‘em.

DOROTHY
That’s for certain.

MARY
Hard to be of service broken down on the side of the road though.

The White Cop springs into action.

WHITE COP
That’s right. That’s right. You need a tow or somethin’?

Dorothy motions to Katherine to toss the screwdriver to her.
She does.

DOROTHY
No, thank you, Officer. I think I got it, right here. Just have to bypass the starter...

Dorothy ducks under the hood. Crosses the screwdriver across the battery poles. SPARK! The engine starts.

DOROTHY (CONT’D)
That’a girl.	We’re all set.

Oh, we wouldn’t want to trouble you.

Mary butts in.

MARY

Damn Mary.

EXT. ROAD - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

The police car screams down the road at a million miles an hour. Dorothy’s car lunges right on its tail.

INT. DOROTHY’S CAR - DAY - CONTINUOUS

Mary’s driving like a mad-woman. Loving every minute of it. Dorothy’s in the passenger seat, white knuckling the dashboard. And Katherine’s in the back, holding onto the ceiling. Praying.

DOROTHY
Slow down, Mary!	You’re too close!

MARY
He said to follow him.

DOROTHY
Doesn’t mean you hit him in the ass!

KATHERINE
Dear Lord...please...I don’t even know where to begin!

MARY
I’ll tell you where to begin: three “colored” women are chasing a white police officer down the highway in Hampton, Virginia, 1961. Ladies, that there is a God ordained miracle!

Mary screams!	Dorothy bursts out laughing.	Finally...
Katherine.	Mary hits the gas.	The car lunges forward.

EXT. NASA - LANGLEY RESEARCH CENTER - DAY - LATER

The sprawling campus of NASA: hangars, wind tunnels, research buildings, surrounded by tall, barbed wire fences and SECURITY.

The police car slows, pulls to the shoulder, as Dorothy’s car speeds past. The White Cop waves them on.

And our camera floats up to...

EXT. SPACE - DAY

From the vast blackness of space...looking down on Planet Earth. Quiet. Picturesque. Peaceful.

Then: a rumbling sound creeps up. And the camera pans to find...a massive ROCKET burning up through the earth’s atmosphere. Atop the rocket, a capsule shakes, rattles, grinds. The noise is deafening.

We then hear a RUSSIAN VOICE, military-esque. The VOICE then translates into TURKISH...matter of fact. And finally: The CRACKLING VOICE of a radio communication in English. Not happy at all. Tense.

CRACKLING VOICE (ON RADIO) Approximate speed: 17,400 mph. Ascend angle: 42.46. Closing.

INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

The Oval Office.	President Kennedy is handed a briefing doc.
He’s worried.	The VOICE OF AN AIDE:

PRESIDENT’S AIDE (O.S.)
Latest intelligence on the Soviet booster rocket still in relay, Mr. President.

INT. US CENTRAL COMMAND - CONTINUOUS

A room packed with US MILITARY BRASS. JIM WEBB, NASA ADMINISTRATOR, a hard, powerful man, is front and center. All eyes are on the radar screen plotting the rocket’s trajectory.

CRACKLING VOICE (ON RADIO)
Disengage booster rocket.	We are go.

SPACE - CONTINUOUS

The booster rocket falls back to Earth, as the dislodged capsule floats at us, into the black of space.

INT. NASA TRACKING CONTROL ROOM - HAMPTON, VA - CONT.

Al Harrison stands in a control room packed with ENGINEERS. He leans forward, owl-eyed on the massive screens tracking the rocket. And then:

CRACKLING VOICE (ON RADIO)
Orbital entry is...go.

SPACE - CONTINUOUS

The capsule twists on axis, revealing...the blood-red hammer and sickle of the Soviet Union. This is Korabl-Sputnik-4. The Russian Military Communication crackles in:

RUSSIAN MILITARY ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
(in Russian, with English subtitles) All systems safe. Confirmed. Orbital entry is established.

THE OVAL OFFICE - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

President Kennedy rubs his eyes.

US CENTRAL COMMAND - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

Dire mood.	Jim Webb picks up a ringing phone.

NASA TRACKING CONTROL - HAMPTON, VA - CONTINUOUS

Harrison, distraught, walks out of the room.

A SCREENING ROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS

A black and white film reel plays. It’s a Russian Press Conference.

A RUSSIAN SCIENTIST is holding a small, wiry dog in a cosmonaut vest. This is ZVEZDOCHKA, the world’s first space traveler: a Jack Russell Terrier mix. He barks.

RUSSIAN SCIENTIST
(in Russian, subtitled in English)
Zvezdochka is ready to go again.
(motions to his side)

So is our comrade, Ivan.

Next to the Scientist: a mannequin with a placard, IVAN IVANOVICH, is propped up in a chair, dressed as a cosmonaut. The Russian press laughs.
 





(CONTINUED)
 
	12	.

CONTINUED:

RUSSIAN SCIENTIST (CONT’D) Now it is time. Mother Russia will be first to put a human in space.

The hoarse voice of Jim Webb breaks in:

JIM WEBB (O.S.)
A goddamn dog!	And a goddamn mannequin!

Webb steps up out of his seat, the news reel plays across his back. The screening room is packed with MILITARY BRASS and NASA ENGINEERS. Including: Al Harrison, Lead Engineer, PAUL STAFFORD, Associate Engineer, SAM TURNER, and Harrison’s Secretary, RUTH.

JIM WEBB (CONT’D)
And then a 1.6 megaton RDS-37
thermonuclear warhead drops down in the

middle of Des Moines.

Harrison stands, holds up his hand. The news reel abruptly stops. Lights come up. It’s funeral wake quiet. Until, Paul Stafford speaks out of turn.

PAUL STAFFORD
Well, that’s a pretty big jump, sir.

Bad move.	Webb turns to Stafford.

JIM WEBB
Who the hell is he?

Harrison defends his man.

AL HARRISON
Paul Stafford...our Lead Engineer, Mr. Webb. I think what he meant to say is that speculation, at least on our side of the equation, can be dangerous.

Webb wags a finger at Stafford.

JIM WEBB
You know what’s dangerous...inaction. Inaction and indecision. The Russians have a spy satellite lapping the planet. Taking pictures of God knows what. The President is demanding an immediate response. No more delays. Alan Shepard, John Glenn, your uncle Bob. Doesn’t matter, just get us up there, Harrison. We can’t justify a space program that doesn't put anything in space.

Webb walks out.	A mass exodus.

EXT. HALLS OF NASA (IBM COMPUTER HALLWAY) - CONTINUOUS

Footsteps echo off the marble floor, as Harrison walks with Paul Stafford, Sam Turner, Ruth, and the rest of the TEAM.

AL HARRISON
(to Stafford)

How did that feel in there, Paul? Do you think you enlightened the Administrator?

Stafford has no response.

AL HARRISON (CONT’D)
He didn’t look enlightened to me.

Harrison stops.	He cleans his glasses.	Addresses SAM.

AL HARRISON (CONT’D)
He look enlightened to you, Sam?

SAM TURNER
Not particularly.

Paul nods.	Harrison walks away.	The Team keeps up.

AL HARRISON
And just so you know, he’s not wrong about what he said in there. You know that, right? Because now that they can get up there, a bomb will follow. That’s what happens to all our good ideas.

Harrison stops again. Stands in front of a window staring at something we can’t see. He’s quiet for the longest time.

AL HARRISON (CONT’D)
Where’s the machine?

RUTH
Any day now, Mr. Harrison.

AL HARRISON
Any day now. What’s it called? The initials...the letters

RUTH
IBM.

PAUL STAFFORD
International business machine.

Harrison jots a note in a mini notebook.

AL HARRISON
Space is business.	I need a
mathematician.

RUTH
I’ll put in another request, sir.

AL HARRISON
Another request. Jesus Christ. We don’t have a single person, in this entire building, that can handle Analytic Geometry?

RUTH
That’s what I’ve been told.

AL HARRISON
Well, tell me something else, Ruth. Like we’re going to find such a person, before the Russians plant a flag on the damn moon.

He walks off again.	Mumbling.	The Team hustles after him.

We stay at the window Harrison was staring into. It’s a stark white clean room. Bright...and empty.

EXT. THE WEST COMPUTING GROUP - BUILDING - LATER

Nondescript brick. A sign reads: West Computing Group. TWO PROFESSIONAL BLACK WOMEN lead us in.

INT. WEST HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

This is the other side of the tracks at NASA. No white marble here. Concrete floor, no frills. We push toward a door labeled: “West Computers,” as the two Black Women enter.

INT. THE WEST COMPUTING ROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS

The West Computing Room is a dumpy rectangle of long tables and mismatched chairs below a “Colored Computers” sign. Dorothy stands in front of TWO DOZEN BLACK COMPUTERS, women of all shapes and sizes, assigning the day’s work. Katherine and Mary stand in back.

DOROTHY
Eleanor you’re with Bernie today in Data

Reduction, Building 202.

Ugh.

Eleanor hops up.

ELEANOR
No thank you, ma’am. Data Reduction’s just fine.

Dorothy holds out paperwork. Eleanor takes it. Heads to the door.

DOROTHY
Mary.

Mary raises her hand like a school girl.

MARY
Present.

DOROTHY
The Mercury 7 prototype has arrived for testing. Mr. Zielinski’s requesting you...for permanent assignment.

Mary can’t contain herself.	This is big news.

MARY
Are you serious?

DOROTHY
Get moving.

Mary literally jumps to the front of the room. Takes her paperwork.

MARY
Thank you.	Thank you!	Thank you, Jesus!

DOROTHY
(privately)

Keep it inside, hon.	The other girls...

Mary tempers her boisterousness.	Buttons it up.

MARY
Sorry, Dor.

Mary winks at her.	Dorothy shakes her head.

Just then, in walks: VIVIAN MITCHELL, Supervisor of Female Computers, flanked by her ASSISTANT. Armfuls of worksheets and graph pads. The Group snaps to attention.

DOROTHY
Mrs. Mitchell.

VIVIAN MITCHELL
We’re on double time this mornin’, girls.

I need these calculations before lunch.

Vivian’s Assistant dumps the workload on the table.	Thud.
Vivian hands Dorothy an assignment sheet.

VIVIAN MITCHELL (CONT’D) The Space Task Group needs a computer ASAP. Someone with a handle on Analytic Geometry. Much to my chagrin, we can’t fill the position outta the East Group.

DOROTHY
Permanent or temp?

VIVIAN MITCHELL
Everything’s temporary, Dorothy.	You
have someone?

Dorothy doesn't hesitate:

DOROTHY
Yes, ma’am. Katherine’s the gal for that.

Vivian looks the room over. Katherine raises her hand, squirms: the Space Task Group is the ‘be all.’

DOROTHY (CONT’D)
She can handle any numbers you put in front of her.

Vivian sizes Katherine up.

VIVIAN MITCHELL
I’ll check her credentials.

And with that, Vivian swoops off.	Assistant behind her.

VIVIAN MITCHELL (CONT’D) Didn’t think of comin’ all the way down here.

They exit.

THE WEST HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Vivian and her Assistant walk away from the Computing Room.
Dorothy comes out, catches up.

DOROTHY
Mrs. Mitchell...if I could-

Vivian stops.	Turns back.

DOROTHY (CONT’D)
My application for supervisor, ma’am. Was wondering if they’re still considering me for that position.

VIVIAN MITCHELL
Yes. Well, the official word is: no. They’re not assignin’ a permanent supervisor to the Colored Group.

Dorothy is sunk.

DOROTHY
I see.	May I ask why?

VIVIAN MITCHELL
I don’t know “why.”	I didn’t ask “why.”

DOROTHY
We need a Supervisor, ma’am. Haven’t had one since Ms. Jansen got sick. Been almost a year.

VIVIAN MITCHELL
Things are workin’ just fine as is,

Dorothy.

DOROTHY
I do the work of a Supervisor. I’m in charge of the Group, like a Supervisor.

VIVIAN MITCHELL
That’s NASA, for ya. Fast with rocket ships. Slow with advancement.
(changes the subject)
Get those trajectories calcs worked out.

We need ‘em for the Redstone test.

Vivian walks off.	Dorothy simmers inside.

EXT. WIND TUNNEL - NASA COMPOUND - DAY

The sun bounces off the massive, silver spheres that house the wind tunnels. Mary, arms loaded with reports and worksheets, walks briskly underneath the turbines.

INT. HALLWAY TO THE WIND TUNNEL - DAY

Mary scoots down the hallway leading to the tunnel. She stops at the edge: for the first time she sees the Mercury 7 prototype capsule suspended in mid-air. Her eyes twinkle at the sight.

THE WIND TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

Mary ambles under the Mercury 7 capsule. She inspects every single bolt, every shingle. This is why she’s here. This is why she works at NASA.

A PA announcement jars her back to reality:

PA ANNOUNCER
Mach 2 tunnel test, T-minus one minute.

Red lights flash, a siren spins. Mary hustles off, through the tunnel. As fans start to whir. Wind builds.

She’s almost at the end, when she missteps off the path. One of her high heels gets caught in the grating.

THE WIND TUNNEL CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Chief Wind Tunnel Engineer: KARL ZIELINSKI, 50s, Polish Jew, stares down from the glass control booth. He sees Mary struggling with the shoe.

THE WIND TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

The wind picks up. Mary’s in a state. Fighting with the shoe. A voice over the PA shocks her:

ZIELINSKI (OVER THE PA)
No shoe is worth your life.

Mary looks up at the control booth. Sees Zielinski staring down at her.

PA ANNOUNCER
Mach 2 tunnel test, T-minus ten, nine, eight...

Mary pulls her foot out of the shoe and runs one-shoed, hobbling toward the exit.
 


(CONTINUED)
 
	19	.

CONTINUED:

PA ANNOUNCER (CONT’D)
Seven, six, five...

Mary steps out of the tunnel. Just as the wind becomes deafening.

THE WIND TUNNEL CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Zielinski and WIND TUNNEL ENGINEERS watch the Mach 2 test. The Mercury 7 capsule is engulfed in forceful winds. It shakes. Rattles. Groans.

Mary comes up behind Zielinski.

The bolts strain on the heat shield.

Pop! One of them pops off, a shingle flies off the heat shield, hits the control booth window. Crash. Engineers jump. Then another two break off. Crash. Crash. A few more. Bang. Bang.

Zielinski holds up his hand.

ZIELINSKI
Shut it down.

The wind subsides.

THE WIND TUNNEL - LATER

Zielinski and Mary are walking around the Mercury 7 capsule.
Inspecting.	Mary’s taking notes.

ZIELINSKI
If we alter the exterior from smooth to
corrugated, the capsule would have more

stability, despite the air displacement.

He stops, touches an indent in the heat shield.

ZIELINSKI (CONT’D)
But the friction it’s under during re-entry...heat trumps wind. It’s less predictable. Note: most shield erosion occurs on the posterior side abutting the retro-boosters. Conclusion?

Mary looks up from taking notes:

MARY
The area closest to the boosters is closest to the heat.

(CONTINUED)
 
	20	.

CONTINUED:

MARY (CONT'D)
Coupled with rising temperatures on re-entry, the contacts soften. We could consider another fastener other than bolts.

Zielinski nods approval. Inspects another section of the capsule.

ZIELINSKI
There’s another opening in the Engineer

Training Program.

She’s heard this before.	Deflects.

MARY
Flat head rivets could reduce wind drag.

He turns to her.	Serious.

ZIELINSKI
Mary...a person with an engineer’s mind should be an engineer. You can’t be a Computer the rest of your life. That would be a tragic waste of your ability.

MARY
Mr. Zielinski, I’m a Negro woman. I’m not going to entertain the impossible.

ZIELINSKI
And I’m a polish Jew whose parents died in a Nazi prison camp. Now I’m standing beneath a space ship that’s going to carry an astronaut to the stars. I think we can say, we’re living the impossible. Let me ask...if you were a white male, would you wish to be an engineer?

Mary doesn’t need to think.

MARY
I wouldn’t have to.	I’d already be one

INT. NASA HALLWAY - LATER

Vivian Mitchell leads Katherine down an endless white hallway. Briefing her:

VIVIAN MITCHELL
Skirts must be worn past the knee.
Sweaters are preferred to blouses.	No
jewelry.	A simple pearl necklace is the
exception.

CONTINUED:

VIVIAN MITCHELL (CONT'D) Your supervisor is Mr. Al Harrison, Director of the Space Task Group. You’ll write research, proof calculations, so forth. Don’t talk to Mr. Harrison lest he talks to you. Not many Computers last more than a few days, he’s been through a dozen in as many months.
(hands her a lanyard)
Your clearance.

Katherine takes the lanyard. She’s overwhelmed. They arrive at steel doors labeled: Space Task Group.

VIVIAN MITCHELL (CONT’D) They’ve never had a colored in here before, Katherine. Don’t embarrass me.

Vivian walks off, leaving Katherine alone. She takes a deep breath. Walks into her future.

INT. SPACE TASK GROUP OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

Katherine steps into a cyclone of activity and stress. ENGINEERS chalk equations on blackboards, slug coffee. AIDES and SUPPORT STAFF scurry, answer phones. This is the Space Task Group: the world’s most exclusive scientific club.

At the back of the room, Harrison paces in his glass bubble, talking with Karl Zielinski.

For the briefest moment, everyone seems to be looking at the black woman who just entered their world. But it’s just a passing moment, there’s far too much to do.

Engineer Sam Turner hands Katherine a trash can.

SAM TURNER
This wasn’t emptied last night.

KATHERINE
I’m sorry.	I’m not-

He’s gone before she can explain. Katherine sees the only other woman in this zoo: Ruth. Puts the trash can down, walks her way.

KATHERINE (CONT’D)
Excuse me, ma’am, Mr. Harrison’s Computer reporting.

Ruth barely looks up from beneath a pile of worksheets.
 




(CONTINUED)
 
	22	.

CONTINUED:

RUTH
(points, far off)

Take the desk in the corner. I’ll get you work in a bit.

She finally notices Katherine is...black. Pauses. Katherine smiles. Ruth considers her. Her strength. Her calm.

RUTH (CONT’D)
Mr. Harrison won’t warm up to you, don’t expect it. Do your work, keep your head down.

KATHERINE
Thank you.

Katherine lingers.

RUTH
Go on.	Get settled.

Katherine walks to her station, way at the back of the room, against the wall. Puts her personals on the desk. Sits. She looks at the Engineer toiling aside her, it’s Paul Stafford. He looks at Katherine. Doesn’t smile. Just studies her.

Harrison (with Zielinski) steps out of his office, eating a sandwich. He barks:

AL HARRISON
Stafford, why are we still losing

shingles off our heat shield?

Stafford damn near jumps.

STAFFORD
We’re working with a prototype of the capsule, Al. It’s one third the size-

AL HARRISON
I get that.

He turns to Zielinski.	Dead serious.

AL HARRISON (CONT’D) Well, do we need to turn our million dollar fan down, Karl?

ZIELINSKI
No, Al.	I don’t think-
 




(CONTINUED)
 
	23	.

CONTINUED: (2)

AL HARRISON
Of course not.	That was a joke.

Back to Stafford.

AL HARRISON (CONT’D)
Paul. If the heat shield comes off, what do you think happens to our astronaut?

Stafford nods his head.

AL HARRISON (CONT’D)
So we’re going to come up with a solve, right?

STAFFORD
Yes, sir.	We’re working on it.

Harrison moves on.

AL HARRISON
Ruth.	What’s the status on my Computer?

RUTH
She’s right in front of you, Mr.

Harrison.

Ruth motions to Katherine.	Harrison gives her a once over.
Not what he expected either.

AL HARRISON
Does she know how to handle Analytic

Geometry?

RUTH
Absolutely.	And she speaks.

KATHERINE
I do, sir.

AL HARRISON
Which one?

KATHERINE
Both, sir.	Geometry and speaking.

Harrison waves a finger at Ruth.

AL HARRISON
Then give her the-

She knows exactly what he’s talking about. She always knows what he’s talking about. She snatches a bundle of worksheets off her desk, rushes them to Katherine.

AL HARRISON (CONT’D)
(to Katherine)

Do you think you can find me the Frenet frame for that data using the Gram-Schmidt--

Katherine glances at the data sheets.

KATHERINE
--Orthogonalization algorithm.	Yes, sir.
I prefer it over Euclidean coordinates.

That’s all Harrison needs to hear.	She knows her stuff.

AL HARRISON
Good. Then, I’m going to need it by the end of the day. And I’m also going to ask you to check Mr. Stafford’s math as well as others on this floor from time to time.

Stafford rebuts.

STAFFORD
I can work that out myself, Al.

AL HARRISON
I’m sure you can, Paul. I’m sure all of you can. But if that were the case, shingles wouldn’t be flying off the heat shield, now would they.

Harrison walks into the center of the Task Group.

AL HARRISON (CONT’D)
Excuse me.	I just want to be clear about
something...in 14 days the Mercury 7 will
be here for training and I have no doubt
that they’ll be asking questions about
our work.	Do I need to remind
everyone...that we are putting a human on
top of a missile and shooting him into
space?	It’s never been done before.	And
because it’s never been done...everything
we do between now and then is going to
matter: it’s going to matter to their
wives, their kids, I believe it’s going
to matter to the whole damn country.

AL HARRISON (CONT’D)
So this Space Task Group will be as advertised. And Americas greatest engineering and scientific minds will not have a problem with having their work checked. Will they, Paul?

He waits.	Then...nods all around.	No issues.

AL HARRISON (CONT’D)
Good.	So let’s have an amen, goddamnit.

THE ENTIRE SPACE TASK GROUP
Amen.

Harrison plods off, into his office.

The Group jumps back into the work.

Katherine arranges her personals.	Everything in it’s place.
Meticulous.

She looks over at a very frustrated and diminished Stafford. He’s using a thick black marker to redact much of the data in a report. He feels Katherine’s gaze, and stares hostilely at her until she looks away.

Katherine puts her head down, opens Harrison’s bundle of worksheets. Starts to dive in.

THUD.	A thick report lands in front of her.	She jolts.
Stafford’s standing above.

STAFFORD
My numbers are spot on.

KATHERINE
I’ll double check them, sir, not a problem.

Katherine opens the report. The black marker redaction is bleeding through pages and pages of numbers. Can’t make out much.

KATHERINE (CONT’D)
I’m not going to be able-

STAFFORD
Work on what you can read. The rest is classified. You don’t have clearance.

Stafford walks off. Joins Sam and a FEW COLLEAGUES at the coffee maker. All clearly talking about Katherine.

She holds Stafford’s report up to the light. This is going to be impossible.

Then...her foot starts tapping, jittery. She crosses her legs. Has to pee something fierce.

She walks over to Ruth, who’s on a phone call.

KATHERINE
Excuse me...

Ruth holds her hand over the phone.

KATHERINE (CONT’D)
May I ask you where the ladies’ room is?

RUTH
Sorry, I have no idea where your bathroom is.

Ruth returns to her conversation.	Katherine walks away.

INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Katherine rushes down the hall, worksheets in her arms.
Searching for a bathroom.	Her papers drop.

At the far end of the hall...she sees the bathrooms. Thank God. She scoops the papers up.

A TRIO OF WHITE WOMEN come out of the ladies’ restroom. They stand outside the door, chatting away.

Damn.	Katherine gathers herself, ducks down another hallway.

ANOTHER HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Katherine’s practically running. No “colored bathrooms” anywhere.

EXT. NASA GROUNDS - MOMENTS LATER

Katherine pushes through steel doors into the blinding sun. Sees the West Campus Building way off in the distance. 1/2 mile away to be exact. She runs.

INT. WEST CAMPUS HALLWAY - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

Katherine sprints down the familiarly dingy West Campus hall. She crashes through a door labeled: “Colored Restroom.”
 
	27	.



THE RESTROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Katherine plops down on the toilet. She reaches down to her feet, puts the paperwork on her lap...and keeps working. Calculating numbers.

EXT. NASA GROUNDS - MOMENTS LATER

Katherine runs back toward the East Campus. As fast as her legs will take her.

INT. SPACE TASK GROUP - MOMENTS LATER

Harrison, one ear glued to a phone, plunges out of his office, looks for Katherine. Not there. He hollers at Ruth.

AL HARRISON
Where’s that girl with those numbers?

RUTH
On a...break.

AL HARRISON
(to himself)

We take breaks now.

Harrison returns to his phone call.

Katherine bursts through the main door.	Ruth intercepts her:

RUTH
My God, where have you been? Are you finished yet?

KATHERINE
I was- Almost. He said: the end of the day?

RUTH
The end of the day around here was yesterday.

Ruth thrusts a double stack of worksheets at Katherine. Thrice the size of the first. Harrison’s voice booms from above.

AL HARRISON
I want those done first.

Katherine startles. Harrison’s outside his office, still on the phone. Then...he disappears again. Katherine inspects the stack. Shell shocked.
 



(CONTINUED)
 
	28	.

CONTINUED:

RUTH
He wants those done first.	Get going.

Katherine hustles back to her station. On her way, she sees Harrison standing in his bubble, still on the phone, staring right at her.

She lands at her desk. Gathers herself. Opens the new worksheets: miles and miles of data. This will be the longest day of her life.

THE COFFEE AREA - LATER

Katherine’s head is buried in data sheets, as she steps up to the coffee counter, holding her cup. She looks around. Only one coffee pot. She picks it up...

Sam looks up from his desk. Sees Katherine pouring her coffee. He looks over at ANOTHER ENGINEER. They share a confused look. OTHER ENGINEERS look over.

Stafford sees everyone staring, he follows their gaze to Katherine. Now stirring her coffee. Sam looks to Stafford, “What the hell is she doing?”

Katherine turns back, sees all the eyes on her. Puts her head down and walks back to her desk.

INT. SPACE TASK GROUP - NIGHT - MUCH LATER

A BLACK CLEANING LADY is wiping the coffee counter.

The Space Task Group is all but abandoned...aside from Katherine working by lamp light at her desk. She finishes her last calculation. Looks up and sees:

Harrison standing in his glass bubble. Scribbling on a chalk board. The only other person left.

She rises, takes her report.	Walks up the stairs.

HARRISON’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

Katherine taps on the glass door.

KATHERINE
Mr. Harrison.

Harrison waves her in.

KATHERINE (CONT’D)
Here you are, sir.
 



(CONTINUED)
 
	29	.

CONTINUED:

Without looking.

AL HARRISON
And Stafford’s heat shield calcs?

KATHERINE
It’s hard to be sure, sir.

That’s not what he needed to hear.	He swivels to her.

AL HARRISON
Do you know what we’re doing here?

KATHERINE
We’re trying to put a man in space, sir.

AL HARRISON
That’s right. So you can throw that in the trash.

KATHERINE
Excuse me?

Harrison gets up, moves around his desk.

AL HARRISON
I said you can throw it away.

He gently takes it out of Katherine’s confused hands.

AL HARRISON (CONT’D)
Here.

Harrison drops her report on top of a trash can overflowing with dozens of similar reports and worksheets. It’s a graveyard of obsolete work.

AL HARRISON (CONT’D)
It's not an insult to your work.

Harrison goes back to the board. Obsessed with the numbers, the logistics.

AL HARRISON (CONT’D)
It's just obsolete. That's how fast things are moving. If I said I was sorry, I'd be saying it all day.

Katherine’s immobile.	Floored.
 







(CONTINUED)
 
	30	.

CONTINUED: (2)

AL HARRISON (CONT’D)
What I’m asking you..what I’m asking everyone one in that room, all my geniuses, is to look beyond the numbers. To look around them. Through them. For answers to questions we don’t even know to ask. Math that doesn’t yet exist.

He studies the math.

AL HARRISON (CONT’D) Because without it, we’re not going anywhere. We’re staying on the ground. We’re not flying into space...we’re not circling the earth. And we’re certainly not touching the moon. And in my mind...I’m already there.

Katherine has no words.

AL HARRISON (CONT’D)
Are you?

KATHERINE
Yes, sir

AL HARRISON
Good. Because I don’t need another smart girl with a calculator.

Harrison stops abruptly, takes off his glasses.	Cleans them.
Katherine is lost.	Finally:

KATHERINE
Can I go, sir?

Harrison remembers she’s in the room.	Turns back:

AL HARRISON
Oh.	Yes.	Yes.	Go home.

He turns back to the board.	Mumbles to himself.

KATHERINE
Good night, sir.

Katherine walks to the door. Harrison starts calculating on the board. Too engrossed to say good night.

INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Katherine walks down the lonely white hallway. She shakes her fists in frustration.
