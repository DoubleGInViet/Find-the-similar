EXT. NASA GROUNDS - NIGHT

Katherine pushes out a door, into the parking lot. She’s relieved to see: Dorothy and Mary leaning on the back of Dorothy’s car. Katherine smiles in relief.

DOROTHY
We’ve been waiting for hours. Next time you catch a bus.

Dorothy steps into the car, starts it up. Mary holds a door open for Katherine.

MARY
(re: Dorothy)

She’s in a mood.

Katherine and Mary hop in the car.

INT. DOROTHY’S CAR - LATER

Dorothy drives. Katherine’s in back. Mary’s shotgun, with her feet on the dash. The car is their sanctuary.

DOROTHY
I haven’t been late one day in ten years. Haven’t been out sick. Haven’t complained. My work’s on time. It’s done right. It’s done well.

MARY
It’s not fair, that’s a fact.

DOROTHY
What’s not fair is having the responsibility of a Supervisor, but not the title or the money. Watching you all get moved on. Now don’t get me wrong, any upward movement is movement for us all. It just isn’t movement for me.

KATHERINE
Truth be told, Dorothy, I don’t know if I can keep up in that room. I’ll be back with the Computers in a week, or out of a job entirely.

DOROTHY
Oh, please. You’re better with the numbers than anyone in there and you know it. Make that pencil move as fast as your mind does, you’ll be fine.
 



(CONTINUED)
 
	32	.

CONTINUED:

Dorothy swats Mary’s feet off her dashboard.

DOROTHY (CONT’D)
And you. Have some respect. Get your damn feet off my dash board. This isn’t your living room.

Mary sits up straight.	Katherine sinks back in her seat.
It’s quiet.	For a long time.	Then:

DOROTHY (CONT’D)
I sound like a supervisor, don’t I?

Dorothy smiles wryly.	Mary and Katherine breathe.

MARY
A mean, ole salty one.

KATHERINE
Riddled with authority.	No question.

DOROTHY
You don’t mess with, Mrs. Vaughan.

Dorothy turns the music up.

EXT. KATHERINE’S HOUSE - NIGHT - LATER

Katherine’s tiny, single-family brick house is modest but well-appointed. She drags up the walkway, waves goodbye to Dorothy and Mary pulling off the curb.

INT. KATHERINE’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Katherine steps inside. The only light shines from the kitchen, where her mother, JOYLETTE, is doing dishes.

JOYLETTE COLEMAN
My word, Katherine. I was fixing to call the National Guard.

Katherine kisses her mom.

KATHERINE
Sorry, Momma.	New assignment.	The Space
Task Group.

JOYLETTE COLEMAN
That sounds important.	It’s a promotion?

KATHERINE
It’s important and overwhelming...maybe a slight promotion.
 


(CONTINUED)
 
	33	.

CONTINUED:

Joylette smiles at her daughter.	Always the encourager.

JOYLETTE COLEMAN
You want the job, right?

KATHERINE
I think so.	It’s a challenge.

JOYLETTE COLEMAN
Nothing you can’t do, Katherine.

Katherine lights up. Joylette’s happy to see a spark in her daughter’s eye.

KATHERINE
Are they sleeping already?

JOYLETTE COLEMAN
They’re pretending to.	They want their
Momma.

Katherine smiles.

INT. KID’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Katherine peeks into the tiny bedroom. One unoccupied double bed. And one twin bed where her daughter JOYLETTE (10) is pushing back against CONSTANCE (8), and KATHY (6), who are trying with all their might to shove Joylette from the bed. Katherine steps in, stops the madness.

KATHERINE
What are you doing!?

CONSTANCE
It’s not fair Joylette always gets to sleep by herself ‘cause she’s the oldest.

JOYLETTE (10)
It is too fair!

KATHY
Nuh unh!

Katherine nods calmly, sits on the double bed.	Pats it.

KATHERINE
Constance, Kathy, come sit.

Constance and Kathy sit on either side of her.
 






(CONTINUED)
 
	34	.

CONTINUED:

KATHERINE (CONT’D)
I understand you want to be grown. And you want your own space. So I’m willing to change the rules--

JOYLETTE (10)
Momma!

Katherine shoots her a look.	Joylette quiets.

KATHERINE
Whoever sleeps in that bed in, Joylette’s place, will also dry the dishes, take out the trash, and do all the rest of Joylette’s choirs.

Constance and Kathy would rather die!

KATHY
That’s okay.	Never mind.

CONSTANCE
She’s not so terrible to share with.

As Constance and Kathy get into bed, Katherine winks at Joylette. Joylette smiles.

KATHERINE
Now don’t let me come home, find you like this again. You should have been asleep. A long time ago.

JOYLETTE (10)
We just wanted to say “good night.”

KATHY
You’ve been gone for 300 hours.

Katherine steps to Kathy’s side of the bed.

KATHERINE
I work full time now.	You all know that.
I have to be the mommy and the daddy.

Just the mention of “daddy”...instant quiet.	Long faces.
Katherine sits on the edge of Constance and Kathy’s bed.

KATHERINE (CONT’D)
I miss your father as much as anyone.

KATHY
He’s with his angels.
 



(CONTINUED)
 
	35	.

CONTINUED: (2)

KATHERINE
That’s right.	He’s with all his angels.

CONSTANCE
And he’s watching over us.

KATHERINE
Every minute.

She tucks Kathy in.

KATHERINE (CONT’D)
So, we’re going to be strong. We’re done crying about it. We have to all do our part now. Which means you have to go to bed like big girls. On your own. Understand?

ALL THREE SIBLINGS
Yes, Momma.

Katherine moves over to Constance.	Tucks her in.

CONSTANCE
Are the Russians fixing to attack us?

KATHERINE
Where’d you hear that?

CONSTANCE
My teacher. She said they’re putting spies and nuclear bombs up in space.

Joylette (10) cuts in.

JOYLETTE (10)
We had to stay under our desks this morning. All scrunched up.

KATHERINE
That’s just a drill. A precaution. Truth is, we don’t know what they’re doing up there.

Katherine moves to Joylette (10), tucks her in.

CONSTANCE
Are you going up to space too, Momma?

KATHERINE
No, baby. But I’m going to help those brave men do it. The best I can.
 



(CONTINUED)
 
	36	.

CONTINUED: (3)

Kathy pulls out a picture she drew of Katherine in space.
Hands it to her.

KATHY
You could fly to space too if you wanted to, Momma. You could be an astronaut.

Katherine’s touched.	She smiles at her babies.	Kisses them.

KATHERINE
Thank you, baby. Now this time...really go to bed.

She turns off the lamp.

EXT. MCCLEAN BAPTIST CHURCH - ANOTHER DAY

Picturesque, white church for an all black congregation.

THE CHURCH SERVICE - CONTINUOUS

Sunday morning. Everyone’s on their feet. The room is packed with FAMILIES. Amongst them: Katherine, Joylette (Mom) and the kids; Mary, her husband LEVI and their kids (LEVI, JR.(5) and CAROLYN MARIE (4)); and Dorothy and her husband, HOWARD and their kids (ANN (16), KATHRYN (14), LEONARD (9) and KENNETH (7)).

The charismatic, PASTOR AYERS, afire, preaches from the hip.

PASTOR AYRES
Praise God that change is coming. From the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, to the good Reverend Dr. King, to the students sitting in at lunch counters in North Carolina.

Amens all around.

PASTOR AYRES (CONT’D)
His faith in us has no limit! The good Lord has our very own women workin’ on rocket ships!

All eyes turn to our women. Here they stand proud, here they’re revered.

PASTOR AYRES (CONT’D)
And we have National Guardsman defending our freedom!

On the front row, a tall drink of water, NATIONAL GUARD COLONEL JIM JOHNSON, bows his head in recognition.
 


(CONTINUED)
 
	37	.

CONTINUED:

PASTOR AYRES (CONT’D)
Give a shout of praise for: Colonel Jim Johnson. Returning home by the grace of God, to set up a National Guard unit right here in Hampton!

Cheers and claps.

PASTOR AYRES (CONT’D)
Can I get a “Hallelujah” in here?!

Refrains.

BEHIND THE CHURCH - CONTINUOUS

An after service banquet: PARISHIONERS everywhere enjoying an outdoor pot-luck.

Mary and her husband, Levi are serving their Kids. A hushed argument:

LEVI JACKSON
Now you want to be an engineer? A female engineer. We’re Negro, baby. Ain’t no such thing. Understand it.

MARY
It’s not like that there, Levi.

LEVI JACKSON
The only real chance we’re gonna have is when we fight back. You can’t “apply” for freedom. Freedom is never granted to the oppressed. It’s got to be demanded. Taken.

MARY
Levi, please. Stop quoting your slogans at me. I’ve heard them all. There’s more than one way to achieve something.

Levi, Jr. interrupts:

LEVI JR.
I don’t want any greens.

LEVI JACKSON
I tell you about interruptin’?

Mary steps in, replaces the greens with mac and cheese.

MARY
Try this, baby.
 


(CONTINUED)
 
	38	.

CONTINUED:

LEVI JACKSON
He’s gonna eat the greens too.

Levi pushes the greens back on his son’s plate.

LEVI JACKSON (CONT’D)
Kid needs to eat vegetables. You would know that, if you were home.

Mary has heard enough.

MARY
You better settle, Levi Jackson. Less you want this female’s mind right here, front of everybody.

Levi backs down.	Hell hath no fury...

LEVI JACKSON
All I’m saying, don’t play a fool. I don’t want to see you get hurt. NASA’s never given you gals your due, having another degree won’t change that. Civil rights ain’t always civil.

He walks off.	Mary serves greens to her daughter, Carolyn.
Cuts her off before she can complain:

MARY
No lip, little miss. Your brother gets them, so do you.

PICNIC TABLES - MOMENTS LATER

Katherine and Dorothy are feeding their Kids, trying to have a conversation.

DOROTHY
I hear he’s planning on staying in the area.

KATHERINE
That’s good for him.

Mary walks up, cuts in:

MARY
Katherine, go find your way over there.

That Colonel Jim’s a tall glass of water.

Across the green: Jim Johnson’s talking to Dorothy’s husband, Howard.
 



(CONTINUED)
 
	39	.

CONTINUED:

DOROTHY
That he is.	Tall.	Strong.	Commanding.

MARY
Probably like that day...and night.

KATHERINE
Mary, it’s Sunday.	Have some shame.

MARY
I will not.

They laugh.	Jim Johnson smiles over at Katherine.

DOROTHY
I think he’s smiling over here.

MARY
(to Katherine)

At you.

Katherine looks.	Yep.

KATHERINE
I’m not smiling back.

Dorothy and Mary look at Katherine.

DOROTHY
Yes, you are.

MARY
You’re all teeth right now.

KATHERINE
I am not.

She is.	Katherine turns away.

DOROTHY
He’s coming this way.

KATHERINE
Why’s he doing that?

DOROTHY
Mary’s waving him over.

Sure enough, Mary’s waving him over.

KATHERINE
Ladies, I don’t know if I’m-
 



(CONTINUED)
 
	40	.

CONTINUED: (2)

MARY
Too late.	Fix your hair on the side.

Jim Johnson arrives.	Dorothy wastes no time:

DOROTHY
Hello, Colonel. I’m Dorothy Vaughan. This is Mary Jackson. I believe you met her husband, Levi.

Jim nods hellos.

JIM JOHNSON
Yes, ma’am.	Good to meet ya’ll.

DOROTHY
And this is Katherine Goble.

Jim and Katherine lock eyes.	Mary blurts out:

MARY
She’s not married. She’s a widow. With three little girls, so well-behaved. Angels on earth, we call ‘em. She can tell you the rest. Dorothy, slice-a pie?

DOROTHY
I’d love one.

And with that, Mary and Dorothy leave Katherine alone with Colonel Jim. He smiles at her.

THE GROUNDS - LATER

Katherine and Jim are walking through the grass.

JIM JOHNSON
Pastor mentioned you’re a “Computer” at

NASA.	What’s that entail?

KATHERINE
We calculate the mathematics necessary to enable launch and landing for the Space Program.

JIM JOHNSON
Aeronautics. Pretty heady stuff. They let women handle that kind of-

He stops himself.	Too late.	Backpedals.

JIM JOHNSON (CONT’D)
Well.	That’s not what I mean.
 


(CONTINUED)
 
	41	.

CONTINUED:

KATHERINE
What do you mean?

JIM JOHNSON
I was just surprised something

so...taxing-

Katherine stops him.

KATHERINE
Mr. Johnson, it may be best if you quit talking right now.

JIM JOHNSON
I’m not meaning any disrespect-

KATHERINE
I’ll have you know, I was the first Negro female student at West Virginia University Graduate School. On any given day I analyze the manometer levels for air displacement, friction and velocity and compute over 10,000 calculations by cosine, square root and lately Analytic Geometry. By hand. There are 20 bright, highly capable Negro women in the West Computing Group. And we’re proud to be doing our part for the country.

Katherine adjusts her glasses.

KATHERINE (CONT’D)
So, yes...they let women do some things over at NASA, Mr. Johnson. But it’s not because we wear skirts...it’s because we wear glasses.

She walks off.	Jim Johnson watches her go, he’s speechless.
And very, very enticed.

EXT. NASA GROUNDS - MAIN STREET - ANOTHER DAY

The energy of a parade. A MARCHING BAND plays, You’re a Grand Old Flag.

A MILITARY MOTORCADE roars to a stop, and out step the guests of honor: The Mercury 7 Astronauts: ALAN SHEPARD, GUS GRISSOM, JOHN GLENN, SCOTT CARPENTER, WALLY SCHIRRA, GORDON COOPER, and DEKE SLAYTON.

Harrison’s the first to greet the Mercury 7. Shaking hands. Making introductions. Ruth and Sam are amongst the welcoming committee.
 


(CONTINUED)
 
	42	.

CONTINUED:

The entire NASA STAFF is lined up in the parking lot. A receiving line. At the end of this very long line of WHITE MALE NASA EMPLOYEES...we find WHITE FEMALE NASA EMPLOYEES. And after that...our “Colored Computers.”

Dorothy’s first, proudly next to Katherine and Mary. She bios the Astronauts for Katherine and Mary.

DOROTHY
Alan Shepard. US Navy pilot. He could be the first man in space.

Alan Shepard waves at the Crowd.

DOROTHY (CONT’D)
That’s Scott Carpenter and Walter

Schirra.	Also Navy pilots.

Shots of the Mercury 7 intercut.

DOROTHY (CONT’D)
All under 5’11”, 180 lbs.	IQs over 130.

MARY
Handsome must be a requirement too.

KATHERINE
How can you possibly be ogling these white men?

MARY
It’s equal rights. I have the right to see fine in every color.

Harrison leads the Astronauts down the receiving line. John Glenn shakes hands.

DOROTHY
That’s John Glenn. The only Marine Corps pilot.

A dashing John Glenn shakes a NASA ENGINEER’s hand.

DOROTHY (CONT’D)
And those three there are Airforce: Gus

Grissom, Gordon Cooper and Deke Slayton.

The Mercury Team lands in front of Vivian Mitchell and the East Computers. Handshakes. Ruth ends the procession.

RUTH
Gentlemen, if we may...much to see around here.
 


(CONTINUED)
 
	43	.

CONTINUED: (2)

The Mercury Team follows Ruth. John Glenn catches Dorothy staring at him from the end of the line. He stops.

JOHN GLENN
Heck, haven’t shaken all the hands yet.

RUTH
We have a fairly tight itinerary,

Colonel.

AL HARRISON
(lets her know it’s okay)

Ruth-

Too late, John Glenn’s already gone. Heading to the end of the line. The Mercury Team follows.

DOROTHY
Sweet mother of mercy. They’re coming this way.

KATHERINE
Look straight ahead.

MARY
Shoot, look right at ‘em.

Mary stares at the Astronauts as they approach. Vivian sees them headed to Mary, Katherine and Dorothy’s way. Hmm.

John Glenn stops in front of Dorothy.

JOHN GLENN
Ladies. Didn’t wanna run off without saying hello. They seem to be in a big rush around here.

Dorothy looks him in the eyes.

DOROTHY
The Russians certainly aren’t slowing down any.

He smiles.	Jokes:

JOHN GLENN
They can’t make a damn ‘frigerator, how the heck they beat us into space?

Dorothy laughs. John Glenn offers his hand. They shake. He moves on to Katherine. Holds out his hand.
 




(CONTINUED)
 
	44	.

CONTINUED: (3)

JOHN GLENN (CONT’D)
What do you gals do for NASA?

KATHERINE
Calculate your trajectories, sir. Launch and landing.

JOHN GLENN
Can’t get anywhere without the numbers.

KATHERINE
No, sir.

He offers Mary his hand. She doesn’t wait for the introduction.

MARY
Mary Jackson, Mr. Glenn. Engineering. Proud as the devil to be workin’ with you.

JOHN GLENN
Thank you, Mary.

He smiles at her. Mary could faint. John Glenn moves down the line. Shaking hands. The other Astronauts follow.

INT. NASA AIRPLANE HANGAR - DAY

A press conference. Camera flashbulbs pop incessantly. The Mercury 7 Astronauts sit at a table in front of DOZENS OF REPORTERS and NEWS CAMERAS.

A REPORTER hollers out to John Glenn:

REPORTER
Colonel Glenn, medical experts have stated that a man cannot survive in Zero-
G.	What are your feelings on the dangers of space flight? Are you scared at all?

John Glenn leans down to his mic.

JOHN GLENN
Well. I only discuss my ‘feelings’ with the Missus.

Laughter.	They love these men.

JOHN GLENN (CONT’D)
I believe I can speak for all of us on this: we’ve been flying most of our lives.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)
 
	45	.

CONTINUED:

JOHN GLENN (CONT’D)
We’re honored to serve our country.
That’s what we signed up for.	We don’t
think about the dangers or have the time
to be scared, we have a job to do.
Whatever happens up there is in God’s
hands.

The Reporter hurls another question:

REPORTER
Well, which one of you wants to go first?

Without a beat...every Astronaut raises his hand. And then John Glenn raises both hands. Laughter. Flashbulbs.

INT. SPACE TASK GROUP OFFICE - DAY

A madhouse.	MORE ENGINEERS, MORE STAFF, more work.

Katherine’s at the coffee counter. There are now two coffee stations...the smaller coffee pot is labeled: “Colored.”

Katherine pours her coffee. Nothing. None made. Imagine that. She makes a pot. Refusing to look around.

KATHERINE’S DESK - LATER

Katherine’s back at her desk, pouring over reports.

Stafford drops a stack of data on her desk.	Redacted.

STAFFORD
Mr. Harrison wants you to confirm launch and landing for the Redstone Rocket test.

KATHERINE
I cannot work on what I cannot see, Mr.

Stafford.

Katherine fans the data sheets.	A sea of black ink.

KATHERINE (CONT’D)
It’s illegible.

STAFFORD
The numbers have been confirmed by two
Engineers in this department, and myself.

It’s more-or less a dummy check.

Stafford walks off.
 






(CONTINUED)
 
	46	.

CONTINUED:

Katherine scans the sheets. Holds them up to the light. She can see through the redaction in places. A few terms bleed through: “Redstone,” “Atlas.” Curiosity peaks.

She looks at the massive chalkboards across the room. A chalked-chart reads: Redstone Rocket Trajectories. She looks back at her worksheets, gathers her work and walks to the boards. Studies the Redstone Rocket Chart.

INT. NASA TECH HALLWAY - LATER

Dorothy’s walking down the hallway with an armload of worksheets. She turns a corner.

INT. IBM COMPUTER ROOM HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Dorothy continues down a different, white-tiled hallway. It’s crowded with massive crates and MAINTENANCE MEN and TECHS unloading high-tech equipment.

The IBM has arrived. And...it doesn’t fit in the door to the white room. Lots of head scratching. A PAIR OF CARPENTERS are hacking away, sawing the door header.

Harrison stands staring at the debacle. Next to him we meet BILL CALHOUN, the young, overly officious IBM Supervisor.

AL HARRISON
No one thought to measure this thing.

BILL CALHOUN
I’m afraid not.	Should we stop?

AL HARRISON
No.	No, just keep going.

Harrison writes a note in his pad.

Dorothy walks by. Instinctively...she knows what this is. The next big thing. And the beginning of the end of human Computers.

INT. EAST COMPUTING GROUP HALLWAY - LATER

Dorothy moves toward a door: “East Computing Group.”

INSIDE THE EAST COMPUTING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Dorothy enters the all-white East Computing Room. A sharp contrast to the West Group’s room. Every WHITE FEMALE COMPUTER has a desk, a matching chair, a lamp. It’s homey, comfortable, spacious.
 



(CONTINUED)
 
	47	.

CONTINUED:

Vivian sees Dorothy, summons her over.

VIVIAN MITCHELL
Our runner can pick up your work, Dorothy. You need to be workin’, not walkin’.

Dorothy puts worksheets in a box next to Vivian’s desk.

DOROTHY
It’s break time, ma’am. No trouble at all.

Vivian points to a massive pile of worksheets within several boxes.

VIVIAN MITCHELL
Since you made the trip...you can take that batch over there.

DOROTHY
Sure thing, Mrs. Mitchell.

Dorothy stands there, a beat too long.

VIVIAN MITCHELL
You need somethin’ else?

DOROTHY
I was wondering if you knew what they’re building in the Tech Wing.

Vivian considers whether to answer.	Then:

VIVIAN MITCHELL
It’s called an IBM. A mainframe machine. Apparently, it can do our calculations in a fraction-a the time.

A knowing moment for both of them.

DOROTHY
Guess that’s good for NASA.

Vivian nods.	Dorothy lingers.	Vivian points off...

VIVIAN MITCHELL
Hurry on, now. Best if you do it in one trip.

Vivian returns to her work.	Dorothy heads to the boxes.
 
	48	.



THE SPACE TASK GROUP OFFICE - LATER

Katherine’s still at the chalkboard staring at that Redstone Rocket Chart. Cross-checking her worksheets.

She picks up a piece of chalk, starts chalking calculations.
Analytic Geometry.	Then a graph...the Redstone’s trajectory.

The chalk line stops suddenly. Just short of a line labeled, “Orbit.” She draws an X on the spot, then writes: “Redstone Fail.” Then she draws another trajectory line that pushes past the “Orbit” line...and labels it, ”Atlas.”

She steps back, looks at her work.	Her leg starts tapping.
She puts the chalk down.

EXT. NASA GROUNDS - CONTINUOUS

Katherine pushes out through the steel doors and runs for the West Computing Building.

THE SPACE TASK GROUP OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Stafford is standing in front of the blackboard, staring at Katherine’s work. He references a worksheet in his hand. He’ll be damned.

Sam Turner comes up behind him. Studies the board. Stafford hands him the worksheet. He compares. Hmmm.

And then, like moths drawn to light, one ENGINEER after another is pulled to the math. Surrounding Stafford and the blackboard. Chatter builds.

Then, a voice from above:

AL HARRISON (O.S.)
Whose work is that?

Harrison stands outside his glass bubble.	No one answers.

AL HARRISON (CONT’D)
I said, whose work is that?!

EXT. COLORED RESTROOM - DAY

Katherine comes out of the bathroom.	Scurries down the hall.

PAUL STAFFORD (O.S.)
How did you know the Redstone couldn’t support orbital flight?
 
	49	.



INT. AL HARRISON’S OFFICE - DAY - LATER

Stafford’s pacing in front of a seated Katherine. Sam and Ruth are behind him, along with a UNIFORMED US MILITARY OFFICER.

PAUL STAFFORD
It’s classified information.

SAM TURNER
It’s top secret.

Across from them is a distressed Katherine.

KATHERINE
It’s not a mystery why the Redstone tests keep failing. It’s fine for sub-orbital flight, but it can’t handle the weight of the capsule and push it into space. The numbers don’t lie.

Pan over to: Al Harrison. He’s been standing quietly off to the side, studying the redacted report.

AL HARRISON
And you figured that out with this? Half the data is redacted.

KATHERINE
What’s there tells the story if you read between the lines. The distance from launch to orbit is known. The Redstone mass is known. The Mercury Capsule weight is known. And the speeds are there in the data.

Impressive.

AL HARRISON
You did the math.

KATHERINE
Yes, sir.	I looked beyond.

AL HARRISON
Then how did you know about the Atlas rocket? That’s not math. That data’s not here. Like he said, it’s classified.

Harrison waves the report at her.	Katherine pauses.

KATHERINE
I held it up to the light.
 


(CONTINUED)
 
	50	.

CONTINUED:

Really. Harrison holds the report up to the light. Squints at the redaction. Sees: “Atlas.”

AL HARRISON
Yep.	There it is.

He shakes his head in disbelief.

AL HARRISON (CONT’D)
What’s your name?

KATHERINE
Katherine Goble.

AL HARRISON
Are you a spy, Katherine?

KATHERINE
Am I what?

AL HARRISON
Are you a Russian spy?

KATHERINE
No sir, I’m not Russian.

Harrison looks to Ruth.

RUTH
She’s not Russian, sir.

AL HARRISON
All right then, we have nothing to lose here. Let’s get her everything she needs to work on Shepard’s trajectories. Without redaction. Are we clear on that?

Nods and agreement.	Stafford objects:

PAUL STAFFORD
Are we sure about this?

AL HARRISON
What’s the issue, Paul? You heard her...she’s not a spy.

PAUL STAFFORD
I just don’t think it’s a good idea.

AL HARRISON
You know what I think is a good idea?

Harrison tosses the redacted documents in the trash.
 


(CONTINUED)
 
	51	.

CONTINUED: (2)

AL HARRISON (CONT'D)
Darker ink. Ruth, think you could pass that along?

He walks out.	Ruth smiles at Katherine.

INT. COLORED CAFETERIA - HALLWAY - LATER

A BLACK COMPUTER pushes through a door labeled: “Colored Cafeteria.”

INT. COLORED CAFETERIA - CONTINUOUS

Hardly an adequate dining space. Cold steel tables, wobbly wooden chairs and a small rectangular window, whereby brown-bagged lunches are distributed to BLACK EMPLOYEES.

Dorothy, Katherine and Mary are at the window, grabbing lunch. Mary’s admiring Katherine’s new lanyard credentials.

MARY
You can probably get to the moon and back with these.

KATHERINE
Just not the bathroom.

MARY
Least they’re not blind to what you do.

DOROTHY
It’s not going to matter soon.	This
IBM’s going to put us all out of work.

They walk to a table.	Sit.	Eat.

KATHERINE
What can we do about it?

DOROTHY
Only one thing to do: learn all we can. Make ourselves valuable. Somewhere down the line a human being’s going to have to hit the buttons.

Through the door, in steps Vivian Mitchell. File folder in hand.

KATHERINE
Oh, mercy.

MARY
Well, she must be lost.
 


(CONTINUED)
 
	52	.

CONTINUED:

Vivian sees the women. B-lines over. She drops the file in front of Mary.

VIVIAN MITCHELL
NASA doesn’t commission females for the

Engineer Trainin’ Program.

Mary ruffles up.

MARY
That position is open to any qualified applicant.

VIVIAN MITCHELL
Right. ‘Cept you don’t have the

educational requirements.

MARY
I have a Bachelors Degree in Mathematics and Physical Sciences. Same degree as most engineers ‘round here.

Vivian does not like to be challenged.

VIVIAN MITCHELL
We now require advanced extension courses through the University of Virginia. It’s in the Employee Handbook. An addendum.

She slides a copy on the table.

VIVIAN MITCHELL (CONT’D)
‘Case you haven’t read it.

Mary can’t control her frustration.

MARY
Every time we have a chance to get ahead, ya’ll move the finish line.

Vivian tightens up.

VIVIAN MITCHELL
I just follow the rules around here. And I expect those who work for me to follow ‘em as well. There are no special circumstances for anyone. Ya’ll should be thankful you have jobs at all.

Vivian walks off.	Steamed.	Mary pushes her lunch aside.
 
	53	.



INT. DOROTHY’S HOUSE - ANOTHER DAY

The living room.	Dorothy and Katherine are playing Bridge.

Mary’s on fire. Bouncing around the room. Reading the NASA Handbook Addendum.

MARY
“For those that cannot attend classes at the University of Virginia, Advanced Extension Courses are available at Hampton High School.”

KATHERINE
That’s still a segregated school.

MARY
Virginia acts like Brown vs. the Board of Ed. never happened. They’ll never just let a “colored” woman take classes at an all white school!

Dorothy is curt.

DOROTHY
Sounds about right.

MARY
That’s all you’re gonna say?

Dorothy rises.

DOROTHY
I’m not going to sit here all day and listen to you complain about the way things are. Petition the court. Fight for what you want.

She throws her cards down.

DOROTHY (CONT’D)
But quit talking about it.

Walks off.	Katherine and Mary are silent.	Then:

MARY
I’ve been complaining?

Katherine nods ‘yes.’

KATHERINE
For days.
 



(CONTINUED)
 
	54	.

CONTINUED:

Dorothy waltzes back in. Holds up a Mason jar of homemade whiskey mash.

DOROTHY
Not one more peep about work.

DOROTHY’S KITCHEN - LATER

Music on the radio. The gals are tipsy. Mary’s dancing around the room. Laughing. Dorothy and Katherine are trying to make a cake and icing. It’s a mess.

DOROTHY
Don’t give her any more.

KATHERINE
I can’t.	She drank it all.

MARY
I’m fine.	I’m as fine as I’ve ever been.

DOROTHY
You’re as drunk as you’ve ever been.

A song comes on the radio, “Twisting The Night Away” by Sam Cooke.

MARY
Damn. It’s my wedding song. Katherine, come dance with me.

KATHERINE
What?	No.

MARY
Come on.	Dance with me.

DOROTHY
Go on, Katherine.	Go dance.

Katherine obliges.	Mary instructs.	Dorothy joins.

MARY
We have to teach you how to get a man!

Katherine hollers.

KATHERINE
Teach me what!

Dorothy and Mary wrap their arms around her.	They laugh.
And dance.	Friends through it all.

EXT. HAMPTON COUNTY COURTHOUSE - DAY

A Civil Rights protest in progress. DOZENS OF BLACK MEN AND WOMEN holding desegregation signs march outside the Courthouse, chanting. A LINE OF WHITE POLICE OFFICERS block the sidewalk.

Levi Jackson’s smack in the middle of the fray. A POLICE DOG rares up, knocking Levi to the ground. He bounces up, full of fire.

Turning the corner, Dorothy and her two youngest: Leonard (9) and Kenneth (6), walk down the opposite sidewalk.

KENNETH
What’s happening over there?

DOROTHY
Don’t pay attention to all that. We’re not part of that trouble.

Dorothy looks across the way, sees Levi in the thick of it.
She pulls her boys up the steps of:

EXT. HAMPTON PUBLIC LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS

They climb the stone stairs of the “Colored Entrance.”

INT. HAMPTON PUBLIC LIBRARY - LATER

Dorothy’s in the middle of an aisle of reference books.
Searching titles.	The boys are at her feet, fussing.

DOROTHY
(taps Leonard on the head)

I told you no fussing around.

Dorothy hands them a book.

DOROTHY (CONT’D)
Read together.	Be quiet.

They do as told. Dorothy keeps searching the racks. She finds what she’s looking for, a book titled: Fortran, The New Language of Computers.

She pulls it off the shelf. A WHITE LIBRARIAN in the next aisle stares back at her.

WHITE LIBRARIAN
We don’t want any trouble in here.
 




(CONTINUED)
 
	56	.

CONTINUED:

DOROTHY
I’m not here for any trouble.

WHITE LIBRARIAN
What are you here for?

DOROTHY
A book.

WHITE LIBRARIAN
You have books in the colored section.

DOROTHY
It doesn’t have what I’m looking for.

WHITE LIBRARIAN
That’s just the way it is.

EXT. LIBRARY - MOMENTS LATER

A SECURITY GUARD escorts Dorothy and her boys, not so gently, out of the library. The Guard grabs the kids’ shoulders, moving them along.

DOROTHY
Get your hands off my boys. Don’t touch them.

She pulls her boys away from the Guard.	Gathers her dignity.
Turns back.	Grits a smile.

DOROTHY (CONT’D)
You have a blessed day.

INT. CITY BUS - LATER

We push past SEVERAL WHITE PASSENGERS to the back of the bus...where we find Dorothy between her boys.

DOROTHY
Separate and equal are two different things. Just cause it’s the way, doesn’t make it right. You understand?

THE BOYS
Yes, Momma.

DOROTHY
You act right, you are right. That’s for certain. Understand?

THE BOYS
Yes, Momma.
 


(CONTINUED)
 
	57	.

CONTINUED:

She smiles at her little men. Settles in. Then...pulls the Fortran Computer book out of her purse.

LEONARD
You took that book, Momma?

DOROTHY
Son, I pay taxes. And taxes pay for everything in that library. You can’t steal what you already paid for.

She opens the book and starts reading to them:

DOROTHY (CONT’D)
Fortran is a new and exciting language used by programmers to communicate with computers...

Titles over: April 12, 1961

INT. DOROTHY’S HOUSE - DAY

A birthday party: Leonard Vaughan’s turning 9. The place is packed with FAMILY, FRIENDS and CHILDREN.

Little Leonard stands, eyes closed (making a wish) in front of a sprinkled cake. He opens his eyes. Blows. Misses a few. Blows again, way too close.

DOROTHY
Cake’s already got sprinkles, baby.

Doesn’t need a shower.

Dorothy gives him a small hug.	Everyone LAUGHS and CLAPS.
Dorothy starts cutting cake.	Katherine and Mary help serve.

At the entry: Howard opens the door for Colonel Jim Johnson.
Holding a bouquet of flowers.	Katherine’s been set up.

MARY
Look at that.	What a surprise.

KATHERINE
I’ll say.

DOROTHY
Howard must have invited him.

KATHERINE
Mmm.	Hmmm.

Colonel Jim stares through the crowd...over at Katherine.
Locks on her.	Smiles.
 
	58	.



THE PARTY - NIGHT - LATER

A swing song plays on the radio. The living-room floor is swaying with Guests swing dancing. Dorothy and Howard. Mary and Levi.

Off to the side we find Katherine. Alone. Until Colonel Johnson walks up.

JIM JOHNSON
I believe I owe you an apology.

KATHERINE
Was that it?

Jim smiles.

JIM JOHNSON
Can I make it while we dance?

Katherine looks up at him.	He sure is handsome.

DANCING - LATER

Katherine and Jim dance.	He’s real good.	She’s real stiff.

JIM JOHNSON
I’m afraid I simply misspoke, Mrs. Goble. I’ve been away for a long time. I imagine, I’m just out of practice.

KATHERINE
Mm-hmm.

JIM JOHNSON
And I was hoping you would allow me to start over?

KATHERINE
Mm-hmm.

JIM JOHNSON
The thing is...I have an interest in getting to know you better.

KATHERINE
Mm-hmm.

He smiles at her.

JIM JOHNSON
You are one tough customer.
 



(CONTINUED)
 
	59	.

CONTINUED:

KATHERINE
You haven't said “you’re sorry” yet.

She’s a whole lot more than he can handle.

JIM JOHNSON
Right.	Of course.	I’m sorry, Mrs.
Goble.

KATHERINE
For what, Mr. Johnson?

JIM JOHNSON
Underestimating you.	Or any woman like
you.	Though I can’t imagine there’s
many.

KATHERINE
There you go. That’s good practice, right there.

They dance on.	Staring at each other.

The music cuts off abruptly.	An ANNOUNCER cuts in:

RADIO ANNOUNCER (ON RADIO)
We interrupt Hampton’s Big Band Hour with breaking news. Russian cosmonaut, Yuri Gagarin, has become the first man in space.

The mood drops.	Dancing stops.	You can hear a pin drop.

RADIO ANNOUNCER (ON RADIO) (CONT’D)
Gagarin completed one full orbit around

the planet in one hundred and eight minutes.

INT. NASA SCREENING ROOM - DAY

Stale air, tension, dead quiet. A news reel plays footage of Yuri Gagarin’s capsule in orbit.

RADIO ANNOUNCER (ON RADIO) This is a crushing blow to America in the race for space.

Yuri Gagarin waves to a crowd of RUSSIAN WELL-WISHERS.

The news reel stops playing abruptly.	Lights rise.
Harrison’s standing in the wings, leaning against a wall.

Stafford, Sam and Ruth are seated amongst Team Members.
 



(CONTINUED)
 
	60	.

CONTINUED:

The Mercury 7 are in attendance, sitting in back. They’re devastated. No one talks. No one moves. It’s like someone died.

Finally, John Glenn speaks up:

JOHN GLENN
Well. They beat the pants off us. Now let’s go on, learn how to fly to space.

He walks out.	The other Astronauts follow.

INT. SPACE TASK GROUP - DAY - LATER

Harrison steps into the Space Task Group. The entire Team is sitting at their desks, standing at stations. Frozen in quiet. Harrison walks to the front of the room. Takes off his glasses.

AL HARRISON
I want to thank everyone for staying. I know it’s late and after what we just saw, I think everyone’s probably anxious to go home. But before we do, I just have to ask... how can it be that we’re in second place in a two man race? Anybody? Paul?

Stafford doesn’t have the answer.	Shakes his head.

AL HARRISON (CONT’D)
Then I think Glenn said it pretty well. They’re just outworking us. And the reason I have to think that is because I refuse to believe that the Russians are smarter than us, or because they have more technology. Or that they care more. But I don’t know? Is that possible? Is it possible that it actually means more to them?

Harrison walks to the middle of the room.

AL HARRISON (CONT’D)
We’re in the fight of our lives, people. I just saw seven faces that don’t think we can get there. This isn’t some epic joyride that we’re all on together. So, as of right now, going forward, there’s only two things you need to know: one, staying late will be a fact of life.

(MORE)
 



(CONTINUED)
 
	61	.

CONTINUED:

AL HARRISON (CONT’D)
And two: your paychecks will not reflect the extra time it takes to catch up and pass those bastards. For those of you that can’t work that way, I understand and thank you for what you've done. For everyone else, you can call your wives and tell them how it’s gonna be. I’ll start with mine.

Harrison walks off.	Up to his office.

INT. AL HARRISON’S OFFICE - DAY - CONTINUOUS

Harrison picks up the phone, dials. Waits. He walks to his window, looks out.

Every single member of the Space Task Group is on the phone.
Quietly talking to their wives, husbands, children.

Paul Stafford. Ruth. Sam Turner. And finally...Katherine Johnson. No one is leaving.

MONTAGE - THE PUSH TO SHEPARD’S LAUNCH

INT. NASA HANGAR - DAY

Astronaut training. A full scale model of the Mercury 7 capsule is suspended in the air. Spinning in all directions. Alan Shepard’s inside. Harrison watches from the ground.

INT. SPACE TASK GROUP - ANOTHER DAY

Katherine’s buried in work. Literally. She’s fighting a cold. Stafford dumps a new load of data on her desk.

STAFFORD
End of the day.

He’s off.	Katherine grabs a tissue, blows her nose.

THE TECH HALLWAY - ANOTHER NIGHT

Dorothy stands at the end of the hallway leading to the IBM room, clutching her purse. Through the window, she sees Harrison alone, standing in front of the IBM. Cleaning his glasses. Tortured by this hunk of metal.

Finally...he walks out. Clicks off the lights. Heads down the hallway.
