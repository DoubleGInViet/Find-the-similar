INSIDE THE WHITE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Dorothy flips the lights back on. The IBM sits ominously staring back at her.

She walks to the keypunch, sits down. Opens a draw. Staring back at her: an IBM User Manual. Bingo.

DOROTHY
Let’s see what you’re made of.

EXT. HAMPTON COUNTY COURTHOUSE - ANOTHER DAY

Mary walks towards the Hampton County Courthouse. Clutching a case file like a security blanket. She turns down a sidewalk labeled “Colored Entrance.”

INT. HAMPTON COUNTY COURTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Mary’s at a window, standing in front of a COURT CLERK.

COURT CLERK
This is your court date.
(stamps her case file)

Colored seats are at the back of the courtroom.

Mary nods.	Too happy to be offended.

INT. WEST COMPUTING ROOM - ANOTHER DAY

Dorothy’s standing at the blackboard in front of her Computing Group. Teaching Fortran, computer basics from her library book.

DOROTHY
The IBM 7090 Data Processing System has the ability to solve problems that cannot be solved in a lifetime of manual labor. When working at optimal capacity it is capable of over 24,000 multiplications per second.

Bernie cuts in.

BERNIE
Holy Moses, that’s lightning fast.

ELEANOR
They’ll never get it to work.

DOROTHY
It’ll run eventually. We have to know how to program it once it does. Unless you’d rather be out of a job?

“Nos” all around.	The Girls re-focus.

INT. IBM COMPUTER ROOM - ANOTHER NIGHT

Dorothy opens the Power Control on the IBM. She inspects the machine’s innards. Cross-referencing with schematics from the IBM Manual. Labeling parts out loud:

DOROTHY
Control console.	Card reader.	Card
punch.	Central Processor.	Mother
board...always a mother around somewhere.

INT. WIND TUNNEL - ANOTHER DAY

Mary finds Zielinski on a ladder, inspecting the Mercury 7 Capsule.

MARY
Mr. Z.

He looks down at her.	She holds up her Court Petition.

MARY (CONT’D)
I have a court date....

Zielinski smiles.

EXT. KATHERINE’S HOUSE - ANOTHER DAY

Katherine, sick as a dog, opens the door to find: Jim Johnson holding a paper bag.

JIM JOHNSON
Heard you were fighting the flu.

He holds up the bag.

JIM JOHNSON (CONT’D) Thought maybe you could use some soup? Hot meal for the girls.

This is a good man.	Katherine can’t deny it.
 
	64	.



INT. KATHERINE’S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - LATER

Katherine, Jim and the Girls are sitting at the table. Plates of food in front of them. The Girls are sizing up every fiber of this new man in their house.

Heads bow for grace. Jim offers Katherine his hand. She takes it.

END OF MONTAGE

EXT. NASA GROUNDS - ANOTHER DAY

Rain pelts the campus.

INT. SPACE TASK GROUP - CONTINUOUS

Harrison barrels out of his office.	Juggling worksheets.
Beyond stressed.

AL HARRISON
Ruth, get the Cape on the line.
Shepard’s trajectories need to be

updated.

He looks over to Katherine’s desk.

AL HARRISON (CONT’D)
Where is she?!

Ruth shrugs.	Harrison, frustrated, walks off.

INT. COLORED RESTROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS

Katherine’s washing her hands. She grabs a stack of worksheets and rushes out.

EXT. NASA GROUNDS - CONTINUOUS

Pouring rain. Katherine runs across campus, back to the East Building.

INT. SPACE TASK GROUP - MOMENTS LATER

Katherine’s soaked like a wet rat. She walks back to her desk. Stafford’s staring at her. Ruth’s staring at her. The whole damn place seems to be staring at her.

AL HARRISON (O.S.)
Where the hell have you been?	Everywhere
I look you're not where I need you to be.

And it's not my imagination.
 



(CONTINUED)
 
	65	.

CONTINUED:

Katherine turns, Harrison’s on the floor.	Katherine freezes.

AL HARRISON (CONT’D)
Where the hell do you go everyday?

KATHERINE
(quietly)

The bathroom, sir.

AL HARRISON
The bathroom!	The damn bathroom!

KATHERINE
Yes, sir.	The bathroom.

AL HARRISON
For 40 minutes a day!? What do you do in there!? We are T-minus zero here. I put a lot of faith in you.

Katherine can barely speak.	She whispers:

KATHERINE
There’s no bathroom for me here.

AL HARRISON
There’s no bathroom? What do you mean there’s no bathroom for you here?

Katherine can’t take it anymore.	Her voice rises.

KATHERINE
There’s no bathroom here. There are no COLORED bathrooms in this building or ANY building outside the West Campus. Which is half a mile away! Did you know that? I have to walk to Timbuktu just to relieve myself! And I can’t take one of the handy bikes. Picture that, with my uniform: skirt below the knees and my heels. And don’t get me started about the “simple pearl necklace” I can’t afford. Lord knows you don’t pay “the coloreds enough for that. And I work like a dog day and night, living on coffee from a coffee pot half of you don’t want me to touch! So excuse me if I have to go to the restroom a few times a day!

You can hear a pin drop. Katherine takes her purse, personals and walks off. Leaving everyone’s jaws on the ground.
 
	66	.



EXT. COLORED RESTROOM HALLWAY - LATER

BANG!	BANG!	BANG!	The sound of hammering, tearing.

A SECURITY GUARD runs down the hallway and arrives upon a scene: a crowd of TECHS and ENGINEERS block the corridor. He pushes through the crowd to the front...where...Ruth holds up her hand, stops him. There in front of the group: an inflamed Al Harrison, wielding a crow bar, is bashing the “Colored Restroom” sign on the wall.

AL HARRISON
Damn thing!

On the other side of the corridor...the entire West Computing Group, including Dorothy and Mary watch in wonder. Katherine makes her way through, landing between them.

Harrison flails away at the sign.	Bang!	Bang!

AL HARRISON (CONT’D)
For Christ’s sake!

Harrison keeps at it. Rip. Bang. The sign’s holding on, with all it’s might. Imagine that. He takes a final successful WHACK! And the sign crashes to the floor.

AL HARRISON (CONT’D) There you have it! No more colored restrooms. No more white restrooms. Just plain old toilets.

Harrison looks over.	He sees Katherine.

AL HARRISON (CONT’D)
Go wherever you damn well please.

Preferably closer to your desk.

Harrison snatches up the sign.

AL HARRISON (CONT’D)
At NASA we all...pee the same color!

He stumbles off. Straight through the Crowd. Shock and pride and justice for all those watching. Katherine nods approval.

Titles over: May 5, 1961

EXT. ROAD - LATER

Jim and Katherine drive down a picturesque road in a convertible.

EXT. SIDE OF THE ROAD - LATER

The convertible’s parked on the side of the road. Katherine and Jim are sitting on a blanket in front of the car. A road-side picnic. Jim pours Katherine a Chianti.

JIM JOHNSON
I think it’s high time that I kissed you,

Mrs. Goble.

KATHERINE
Oh.	And why’s that?

JIM JOHNSON
Figure you’re attracted to me the same as

I to you.

KATHERINE
Is that right?

JIM JOHNSON
Yes. Or you would have told me to get going a long time ago.

Jim leans in and kisses Katherine. She doesn’t flinch. Jim leans back.

KATHERINE
Haven’t kissed a man in a long time.

Almost forgot how.

Jim leans in again.	They kiss again.

Applause. The Group disperses. Harrison takes the paper from Stafford. Walks off.

INT. IBM COMPUTER ROOM - ANOTHER DAY

Dorothy’s in a familiar position: deep within the IBM. She’s running a diagnostic.

She moves to the control panel.	JFK plays under:

JFK (V.O.)
Yet the vows of this Nation can only be fulfilled if we in this Nation are first, and, therefore, we intend to be first.

She types a command. Hits enter. Throws the switch. The IBM whirs to life. Lights. Noise. Drives spinning.

She runs to the card feeder. Stuffs a stack of programming cards in. The machine sucks them right up.

DOROTHY
That’a girl.

A VOICE catches Dorothy off guard:

BILL CALHOUN (O.S.)
What the hell are you doing!?

Now standing in the doorway: Bill Calhoun and a FEW MAINFRAME TECHS have returned from lunch.

BILL CALHOUN (CONT’D)
You can’t be in here.	Who are you?

DOROTHY
I’m with the West Computing Group.

Dorothy Vaughan, sir.

Bill steps up to her. Dorothy presents her NASA ID. A Tech rushes to the IBM.

BILL CALHOUN
What kind of numbers?

The Tech holds up a worksheet pouring out of the IBM.

TECHNICIAN
Look.

Bill moves to the machine, sees for himself. Turns back to Dorothy. Who just smiles.

INT. MARY’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Levi’s standing in front of the TV watching the news. As the Kids clean the dishes off the table.

Walter Cronkite reports on the KKK fire bombing of the Freedom Riders’ bus (May 14, 1961.) Images of the charred bus. Battered RIDERS. The extreme violence.

WALTER CRONKITE
The mob of Klansman threw fire bombs at the bus, as it stopped in Anniston, AL. Fire and smoke trapped many of the Riders inside the vehicle.

Mary comes home from work. No one greets her. Odd. She walks behind Levi. Sees:

WALTER CRONKITE (CONT’D)
The local police stood by as the choking riders fled the flaming bus.

She moves to turn the TV off.

FOLKS litter the front of the Courthouse steps.

INT. HAMPTON COUNTY COURTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

A packed courtroom. NERVOUS DEFENDANTS, LAWYERS. Way in the back corner, past the sea of White Folks: Mary sits in “Colored Seating,” tapping her foot. Finally, A COURT CLERK calls her name:

A COURT CLERK
Mary Jackson. Petition to attend courses at Hampton High School.

Mary hops up. Approaches the rail. A WHITE-HAIRED SOUTHERN JUDGE looks up from the case notes. Stops in his tracks when he sees Mary is...black.

MARY
Good morning, your honor.

THE JUDGE
Hampton High School is a white school,

Mrs. Jackson.

MARY
Yes, your Honor.	I’m aware of that.

The Judge flips through the case notes.

THE JUDGE
Virginia is still a segregated state. Regardless of what the Federal Government says or the Supreme Court says. Our law is the law.

He reaches for his rejection stamp.	Mary blurts out:

MARY
Your Honor, if I may, I believe there are special circumstances to be considered.
 


(CONTINUED)
 
	74	.

CONTINUED:

THE JUDGE
What would warrant a colored woman attendin’ a white school?

MARY
May I approach the bench, sir?

The Judge considers, waves the BAILIFF to let her through.

Mary walks through the rail gate, stands in front of him.

MARY (CONT’D)
Your Honor, you of all people should understand the importance of being first.

THE JUDGE
How’s that, Mrs. Jackson?

MARY
You were the first in your family to serve in the Armed Forces. US Navy. The first to attend University. George Mason. And you are the first State Judge to be re-commissioned by three consecutive Governors.

THE JUDGE
You’ve done some research.

MARY
Yes, sir.

THE JUDGE
What’s the point here?

MARY
The point is, your Honor...

Mary leans in.

MARY (CONT’D)
No Negro woman in the State of Virginia has ever attended an all white school. It’s unheard of.

THE JUDGE
Yes.	It’s unheard of.

MARY
And before Alan Shepard sat on top of a rocket, no American had ever touched space.

And I, sir, plan on being an engineer at NASA. But I can’t do that without taking those classes at that all-white high school. And I can’t change the color of my skin. So...I have no choice but to be the first. Which I can’t do without you.

Mary looks around the courtroom.

MARY (CONT’D)
Your Honor, of all the cases you’ll hear today, which one will matter in a hundred years? Which one will make you the “first?”

Mary stops talking. The Judge is jarred. He looks around. Considering his legacy. Considering her passion. Then quietly:

THE JUDGE
Only the night classes.

Mary closes her eyes.

EXT. COURTHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Mary steps of the courthouse. Containing herself...until she can’t hold it in any longer. She screams. She screams with everything she’s got. Happy and free and full.

INT. SPACE TASK GROUP - ANOTHER DAY

Katherine’s at her desk, typing a report.

INSERT TYPING: “Gus Grissom, Launch and Landing Projections,

She hesitates. Then adds: “and Katherine Goble.” She pulls the cover page out of the typewriter and sets it on top of the full report.

Harrison, Stafford, Sam and a few ENGINEERS come out of
Harrison’s bubble.	Passing Ruth:

She hands Stafford the report.

KATHERINE (CONT’D)
I’d like to get a jump on John Glenn’s trajectory.

Stafford slows down.	What!?

PAUL STAFFORD
Do you have any idea what you’re asking?

Katherine won’t be deterred.	She digs in.

KATHERINE
An orbital launch with an Atlas Rocket is going to take time.

Harrison slows down, turns back.

AL HARRISON
Is there a problem?

KATHERINE
Mr. Harrison...I was wondering....

AL HARRISON
I’ve been wondering my whole life. Spit it out.

KATHERINE
Well, sir, I’d like to get a jump on John

Glenn’s trajectory.

AL HARRISON
This isn’t about plugging in numbers, this is about inventing the math. I think we talked about that. It doesn’t exist.
 



(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

KATHERINE
I can do it, sir.

PAUL STAFFORD
Do you know how exacting these

calculations have to be?

KATHERINE
Yes. It’s like shooting a sawed-off shotgun from a thousand feet and getting that one beebee through a hole so tiny, you can’t even see it.

Stafford is not impressed.

KATHERINE (CONT’D)
I’m an excellent shot, sir.

Harrison studies her. She doesn’t flinch. He takes the report from Stafford. Checks Katherine’s math.

AL HARRISON
How do Grissom’s numbers look good.

Paul?

PAUL STAFFORD
They appear spot on.

Harrison nods his decision.

AL HARRISON
Give Glenn’s orbit a go. But you run it all through Stafford. You understand?

KATHERINE
Yes, sir.	Thank you.

Harrison hands the report back to Stafford.	Walks off.
Stafford looks at the report, the cover page.	Miffed.

PAUL STAFFORD
Computers don’t author reports.

Stafford rips the cover page off and hands it to Katherine.
Catches up to Harrison.

The tip of the Liberty Bell 7 capsule sinks below the black.
Harrison sits.	Devastated.

INT. SENATE HEARING ROOM - ANOTHER DAY

Senate Hearing in progress. Harrison sits in front of a panel of SENATORS. SENATOR PATRICK grills Al Harrison.

SENATOR PATRICK
Mr. Harrison, American Taxpayer money sank in the ocean along with your capsule. What makes you think you can bring John Glenn home safely?

Harrison adjusts himself.	Takes a moment.	Then:

AL HARRISON
Well, let me say first that discovery is never for the sake of discovery but for the sake of human survival, gentlemen, and it will always come with risk. Whoever gets there first, will make the rules.

AL HARRISON (CONT'D)
That’s been true of every civilization. And so I think the bigger question for this body to consider is: who do you want calling the shots in space?

The Senators are silent.	Harrison swings for the fences:

AL HARRISON (CONT’D) We have to know what’s out there, Senator. If only to ensure our own survival. We have to touch the stars. And only a man can do that. We’ll get John Glenn home safely because we have to, because he has to tell us what he saw.

He stops talking, the Senate Panel weighing his words.

EXT. NASA GROUNDS - ANOTHER DAY

The NASA Campus is still.

INT. SPACE TASK GROUP - DAY - CONTINUOUS

Paul Stafford’s sitting on his desk. The Space Task Group stands all around him. He’s holding a miniature of the Mercury Capsule.

PAUL STAFFORD
The Redstone Rocket: went straight up. The capsule didn't have enough speed to go into orbit. It came back down.

He waves the Capsule up, then back down.

PAUL STAFFORD (CONT’D) Essentially it’s a triangle: Earth, suborbit, Earth. The math was known. It took Shepard, it took Grissom. It cannot take Glenn.

Stafford demonstrates with the Capsule. Stopping it in mid air.

PAUL STAFFORD (CONT’D)
The Atlas Rocket can push us into orbit. It goes up. Delivers the capsule into an elliptical orbit. Earth’s gravity keeps pulling it, but it’s going so fast that it keeps missing the Earth - that's how it stays in orbit.

He arcs the model in an ellipse, around and around.
 


(CONTINUED)
 
	81	.

CONTINUED:

PAUL STAFFORD (CONT’D)
Getting it back down...that’s the math we don’t know.

Katherine raises her hand.	A question.	Stafford acquiesces.

KATHERINE
So...the capsule will spin around the Earth forever, because there’s nothing to slow it down?

PAUL STAFFORD
Yes. Slowing it down at precisely the right time, by precisely the right amount is the task.

She raises her hand again.	Demonstrates with her pencil.

KATHERINE
So...it has to move from an elliptical orbit to a parabolic orbit?

PAUL STAFFORD
Yes.	That’s the Go/ No Go.

He pulls the model closer.	Tightens the orbit.

PAUL STAFFORD (CONT’D)
This point is a pin head. We bring him in too soon...

Sam interjects:

SAM TURNER
He burns up on reentry.

Stafford completes.

PAUL STAFFORD
Too late...and he’s pushed out of Earth’s gravity.

Katherine raises her hand...doesn’t wait.

KATHERINE
Any changes in mass, weight, speed, time,
distance, friction...or a puff of
wind...would alter the Go/No Go.	And we
would have to start calculating all over.

Yes?
 






(CONTINUED)
 
	82	.

CONTINUED: (2)

PAUL STAFFORD
Yes. We have to be able to choose this re-entry point. The Go/No Go has to be exact.

Stafford motions to Sam, who hands out data briefs.

PAUL STAFFORD (CONT’D)
These are the latest Redstone numbers and current capsule data. Obviously, we know the launch spot.

Engineers scan the data.

Harrison and Jim Webb step out of Harrison’s office

PAUL STAFFORD (CONT’D)
The Pentagon Briefing should illuminate where the Navy needs the recovery zone. We work backwards from there. The rest is on us.

Stafford heads off in Harrison and Jim Webb’s direction.
Katherine catches up to him.

KATHERINE
Mr. Stafford.

Stafford slows.

KATHERINE (CONT’D)
Sir.	I if can attended these briefings,
I would be more useful to the project.

STAFFORD
Pentagon briefings are closed door.

KATHERINE
Yes. But you know without the latest information, we can’t keep up. I need the changes as they occur. As you said, it’s a pin head.

STAFFORD
That’s the job, Katherine. You asked for the assignment. Calculate with what you have. Or we’ll find someone who can.

Stafford walks off.	Katherine’s frustrated.

INT. SPACE TASK GROUP - NIGHT

Katherine’s at the chalk board.	Working the math.
Determined.	Exhausted.

INT. SPACE TASK GROUP HALLWAY - ANOTHER DAY

Harrison, Stafford, Sam and Team are walking to the Pentagon briefing. Katherine catches up to them, report in hand:

KATHERINE
Launch parameters for Friendship 7, sir.

PAUL STAFFORD
It’s all moot. We’re altering the window on the capsule.

KATHERINE
When did that happen?

PAUL STAFFORD
6 minutes ago.	The mass is changing.
Start over.

Katherine’s irked, all her hard work...pointless.

KATHERINE
Sir.	If I could attend these
briefings...I’d be able to stay current-

PAUL STAFFORD
We’ve been through this, Katherine. It’s not possible. There’s no protocol for women attending.

KATHERINE
There’s no protocol for a man circling the Earth either, sir.

Stafford hands her report back to her.

PAUL STAFFORD
That’s just the way it is.

He walks off. Katherine keeps her head high. Harrison clocks it all.

INT. SPACE TASK GROUP - ANOTHER DAY

Katherine’s high on the ladder at the chalkboard. One leg dangling as she computes. Chalk dust flies.

Harrison’s in his office on the phone, looking out at her.

Colonel Glenn’s launch coordinates accounting for the window change, sir.

She hands her report to Stafford. Stafford sees her name on the cover.

PAUL STAFFORD
I’ve told you this: Computers don’t author reports. Fix it.

He shoves the report back at her.	She won’t take it.

KATHERINE
Those are my calculations. My name should be on it.

He pulls the cover page off. Katherine reaches for the report now. A tug-of-war.

PAUL STAFFORD
That is not the way it works.

Harrison turns back.	He’s watched this long enough.

AL HARRISON
Paul.	What’s happening here?

Katherine let’s go of the report. Addresses the bigger issue:

AL HARRISON
Why’s that?

KATHERINE
Well, sir, the data changes so fast. The capsule changes. The weight and the landing zones are all changing daily. I do my work, you attend these briefings and I have to start all over. Colonel Glenn launches in a few weeks. And we don’t have the math figured out yet.

Harrison weighs it out.	He turns to Stafford.

AL HARRISON
Why can’t she attend?

PAUL STAFFORD
She doesn’t have clearance, Al.

Harrison nods.

KATHERINE
I cannot do my work effectively without having all of the data and all of the information as soon as it’s available. I need to be in that room, hearing what you hear.

PAUL STAFFORD
Pentagon Briefings are not for civilians.

It requires the highest clearance.

KATHERINE
I feel like I’m the best person to present my calculations, Mr. Harrison.

AL HARRISON
You’re not going to let this go. Are you?

KATHERINE
No, sir.

Harrison nods again. Takes off his glasses.	Stafford shifts.

PAUL STAFFORD
And she’s a woman. There’s no protocol for a woman attending.

AL HARRISON
Okay, I get that part, Paul. But within these walls, who makes the rules?

KATHERINE
You, sir.	You’re the boss.

Katherine looks at Stafford.

KATHERINE (CONT’D)
You just have to act like one.

Harrison looks at Katherine.	She’s got serious guts.

AL HARRISON
You keep quiet.

Stafford, frustrated, pushes past them and into the room.

KATHERINE
Thank you, sir.

INT. NASA BRIEFING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER	(FORMERLY 162)

A tornado of high level testosterone: Jim Webb, MILITARY BRASS, John Glenn and the Mercury 7. Harrison, Stafford and Sam enter...Katherine in tow. A record scratch. Until:

AL HARRISON
This is Katherine Goble with our Trajectory and Launch Window Division. Her work is pertinent to today’s proceedings.

No one questions Harrison. She takes a seat at the end of the table. A little mouse in this room. Harrison dives right in, dropping reports on the table. They’re passed out.

AL HARRISON (CONT’D)
We have a confirmed launch window for Friendship 7. Let’s discuss a landing zone.

JIM WEBB
The Navy needs a singular landing zone.

All eyes shift to the Navy Officer.

NAVY OFFICER
20 miles square is what we can service for retrieval. Outside of that, we risk the capsule’s recovery.

PAUL STAFFORD
We’d like 3 possible recovery areas.
 




(CONTINUED)
 
	87	.

CONTINUED:

NAVY OFFICER
We can’t cover half the damn ocean.

Harrison steps in.

AL HARRISON
Our capsule’s being altered daily. And we’re orbiting the Earth at...what’s the speed now?

Harrison looks at Stafford. Who starts frantically flipping through the report. Katherine saves him:

KATHERINE
17,544 miles per hour.

All eyes shift to Katherine.	Harrison looks at Katherine.

KATHERINE (CONT’D)
At the time the rocket delivers the capsule into low space orbit.

Silence.	This woman spoke.	This black woman.	Then:

JOHN GLENN
That’s one hell of a speeding ticket.

Laughs. John Glenn’s lightened the mood. Webb stares curiously at Katherine.

JIM WEBB
So we have the capsule’s speed, launch window and for argument’s sake, let’s say the landing zone is The Bahamas...should be enough to figure the Go/No Go.

PAUL STAFFORD
In theory, sir.

JIM WEBB
We’re flinging a man around the globe at 17,000 miles per hour...we need to be past theory at this point.

AL HARRISON
We’ll be able to calculate a Go/No Go with that information.

JIM WEBB
When is that going to happen?

Harrison considers his words. Then he looks over at Katherine.
 


(CONTINUED)
 
	88	.

CONTINUED: (2)

AL HARRISON
Katherine.

Katherine is frozen. He’s serious. Harrison holds out a piece of chalk:

AL HARRISON (CONT’D)
Have a go at it?

Katherine takes the chalk. Rises. Slowly walks to the board. All eyes on her. She stands with her back to the room. A mess they can’t see. She takes a deep breath. And puts her chalk to the board.

And...the numbers churn out.	She narrates:

KATHERINE
The Go point for re-entry is 2,990 miles from where we want Colonel Glenn to land.

She references a coordinate map.

KATHERINE (CONT’D)
If we assume that’s The Bahamas...

She writes coordinates for The Bahamas.

KATHERINE (CONT’D)
At 17,544 miles per hour upon reentry...

Chalk dust flying.

KATHERINE (CONT’D)
At a descent angle of 46.56 degrees...

Chalk scrawling.

KATHERINE (CONT’D)
That puts the landing zone at...

Scratch, scratch.

KATHERINE (CONT’D)
25.0667° North, 77.3333° West.

Scribble, scribble. The board is flush with numbers. She circles the final coordinates. And then the spot on the map estimating the landing zone.

KATHERINE (CONT’D)
Right here. Give or take 20 square miles.
 



(CONTINUED)
 
	89	.

CONTINUED: (3)

Silence as the room studies the board. Her speed, precision and talent is remarkable. Harrison has witnessed her genius, he knows she’s the one.

John Glenn breaks the silence.	Smiles at Katherine.

JOHN GLENN
I like her numbers.

And that’s it.	Katherine is approved.

Webb’s not satisfied.

JIM WEBB
That’s assuming the capsule hits the re-entry point exactly. How do we insure that?

Katherine doesn’t have the answer.	Harrison steps in.

AL HARRISON
That’s the math we don’t have yet, gentlemen. We’re working on it.

Harrison walks out.	Katherine tags after him.

INT. IBM COMPUTER ROOM - ANOTHER DAY

Harrison stands in front of the massive mainframe. Bill Calhoun and IBM Techs at his side. The IBM hums in the background.

AL HARRISON
What’s it gonna take to make this thing worth the price tag?

BILL CALHOUN
We’re just getting up to speed here, Mr.
Harrison.	I need more man power.

Programmers.	Folks to feed the cards.

AL HARRISON
Then get them, for crying out loud. You’re the IBM man. Pull them out of the sky if you have to, but let’s get ahead of this thing. Or I’m not paying you either.

Harrison walks out.

INT. WEST COMPUTING GROUP HALLWAY - DAY - LATER (FORMERLY 148)

Dorothy’s reading the assignment sheet.

DOROTHY
Me?

VIVIAN MITCHELL
Temporarily.	Yes.	We need the IBM for
Glenn’s launch.	The Lead Engineer says
you’re good with the cards, programming
and such.

DOROTHY
What about the girls here?

VIVIAN MITCHELL
Human computers can’t calculate an orbital flight in the time we have. They’ll stay put for now.

DOROTHY
What about after “now?”

Vivian shifts.	Dorothy knows.

VIVIAN MITCHELL
After the Glenn launch, NASA’s dissolvin’ the Computing Groups.

Dorothy thinks it over. She hands the assignment back, draws a line:

DOROTHY
I’m not accepting reassignment.

Vivian tightens up.

DOROTHY (CONT’D)
Unless...I bring my ladies with me.

VIVIAN MITCHELL
Excuse me?

DOROTHY
We’re going to need a lot of manpower to program that beast. I can’t do it alone. My gals are ready. They can do the work.

Dorothy won’t budge.	Vivian won’t budge.

INT. WEST COMPUTING ROOM - CONTINUOUS	(FORMERLY 150)

Dorothy enters the room, holding a NASA Memo.

DOROTHY

Dorothy leads her Group down the hallway.

NASA GROUNDS - CONTINUOUS

The Women walk in the sunshine en route to East Campus.

THE IBM COMPUTER ROOM HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

They arrive in the Tech Hallway. And finally...at the door to the IBM Room.

Dorothy straightens herself...and opens the door. And the all-black West Computing Group steps into the all-white IBM room.

INT. SPACE TASK GROUP - ANOTHER DAY

Harrison’s standing at the window watching Katherine toil away at the chalkboards. She’s frustrated. She erases a few lines of calculations and starts all over.

Stafford drops a report on Harrison’s desk.

PAUL STAFFORD
Today’s heat shield test data, Al.

Stafford walks off.	Stops when:

AL HARRISON
Do you know what your job is, Paul? To find the genius among those geniuses. To pull us all up. We all get to the peak together, or we don’t get there at all.

Stafford understands.

PAUL STAFFORD
Yes.	Well.	Good night, sir.

Stafford walks out.
 
	92	.



INT. SPACE TASK GROUP - NIGHT

Once again...Katherine is among the last “men” working. She’s standing in front of the chalkboard, staring at the numbers. Stuck, for the first time in her life.

Stafford stops at his desk. Looks over at Katherine. Stares at her work on the board.

He walks past her, without a word.

EXT. MARY’S HOUSE - DUSK

Dusk light bathes Mary’s house.

INT. MARY’S HOUSE - ANOTHER NIGHT

Mary’s sitting on the bed, putting on her stockings. Levi enters, holding a small box.

MARY
I don’t know when I’ll be home. The class ends at 9.

Levi just stands there.

MARY (CONT’D)
You have something to say?

He hands her the box.

LEVI JACKSON
Thought you might need these.

Mary opens the box.	A set of mechanical pencils.

LEVI JACKSON (CONT’D)
You can refill ‘em with any weight lead you want.

Levi sits next to her.	Demonstrates how they work.

LEVI JACKSON (CONT’D)
Just pull the eraser off, like this, drop the new lead down through here.

Mary watches him, not the pencil.	He takes her hand.

LEVI JACKSON (CONT’D)
You’re going to make a fine engineer.

MARY
You think so?
 


(CONTINUED)

LEVI JACKSON
Yes.	Nobody dare stand in the way of
Mary Jackson’s dreams.	Myself included.

MARY
Amen.

Levi kisses her.	Mary touches his face.

MARY (CONT’D)
Don’t make me mad again.

LEVI JACKSON
Yes, Ma’am.

They kiss again.

EXT. HAMPTON HIGH SCHOOL - NIGHT - LATER

A city bus pulls away, leaving Mary standing in front of Hampton High School. She stares at the building, takes a deep breath and walks toward the entrance.

INT. HAMPTON HIGH SCHOOL - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

Mary walks down the darkened hallway of this typical High School. A lone light shines from the one open door at the end of the hall.

INT. CLASSROOM - CONTINUOUS

Mary steps into the classroom. TWO DOZEN WHITE MALE STUDENTS look up at once. The PROFESSOR turns from the board.

MARY
Good evening.	Is this Quantum Mechanics?

PROFESSOR
Yes.

Mary approaches, hands him a copy of her petition.

MARY
I’m Mary Jackson.	I’m enrolled.

The Professor scans the petition. It’s official. He’s genuinely confused.

PROFESSOR
Well. The curriculum is not designed for teaching...a woman.

She’s unstoppable:
 


(CONTINUED)
 
	94	.

MARY
Well, I imagine it’s the same as teaching a man.
(she smiles at him)

I don’t see a colored section. Should I take any seat?
 

He nods.	Mary turns to the class.
the back row.	Few in the middle.
 


A few seats left. Few on One on the front row.

 
Mary steps forward, all eyes on her. She considers her choices. Then...she plops down. First row. Dead center. She pulls out her notebook. Let’s go.

INT. SPACE TASK GROUP - ANOTHER DAY

Al Harrison sits at his desk, tortured. Studying. He turns to his board, the math. The camera pushes past him to the numbers.

INT. SPACE TASK GROUP - ANOTHER DAY

Katherine’s back at the board in front of a chalked drawing of the capsule’s orbits. Stafford’s sitting on the desk behind her. Sam and other Team Members wrap around.

KATHERINE
The problem is when the capsule moves
from an elliptical orbit to a parabolic
orbit.	There’s no mathematical formula
for that.	We can calculate launch,
landing, but without this
conversion...the capsule stays in orbit,
we can’t bring it home.

Katherine puts her chalk down. Harrison comes up behind them. Studies the board.

AL HARRISON
Maybe we’re thinking about this all wrong.

PAUL STAFFORD
How’s that?

AL HARRISON
Maybe it’s not new math at all.

Katherine lights up.	An idea:

KATHERINE
Maybe it’s old math. Something that looks at the problem numerically.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)
 
	95	.

CONTINUED:

KATHERINE (CONT'D)
And not theoretically. Math is always dependable.

AL HARRISON
For you it is.

Harrison walks away. Katherine stands back and looks at the board. The digits come alive. They bounce off the drawings. All she sees are the numbers now.

KATHERINE
Euler’s Method.

PAUL STAFFORD
That’s ancient.

KATHERINE
Yes.	But it works.	It works
numerically.

She walks off.

INT. WEST COMPUTING ROOM - DAY - LATER

Katherine steps into the West Computing Room. She moves to a bookshelf and starts digging through math textbooks. She finds a book on Euler’s Method.

INT. SPACE TASK GROUP - LATER

The book hits her desk.	Pages flip.	Euler’s Method.
Katherine studies the pages.	She rushes to the chalk boards.
Erases everything.	Starts over.

INT. SPACE TASK GROUP - ANOTHER DAY

Once again, Katherine’s at the chalkboard. The entire surface is full of calculations. Katherine, one hand holding the textbook, the other her chalk, finishes the last bit of math on the far right bottom of the board. Almost on her knees.

She circles the Go/No Go. She transfers the number to a diagram of the re-entry point. She did it.

Katherine puts the chalk down. Turns around. The entire Space Task Group is behind her. Staring up at the board.

Paul Stafford walks up to Katherine at the board. Inspects the work. Then:

PAUL STAFFORD
Let’s type it up.
 


(CONTINUED)
 
	96	.

CONTINUED:

Katherine smiles.	Heads off to her desk.

INT. SPACE TASK GROUP - NIGHT

Katherine finishes typing her report.

INSERT: Friendship 7: Launch, Landing and Go/No Go Analysis.
By: Paul Stafford.

She pulls the cover page out, sets it on top of the rest of her report. And walks the document over to Stafford’s desk. He nods a thank you.

Stafford walks up to Harrison’s office. Hands him the report and the two men talk. As Katherine puts on her coat, turns off her lamp. And walks out.

INT. RESTROOM - NIGHT - LATER

Dorothy’s washing her hands, rinsing her face. It’s been a long day.

A toilet flushes behind her...and out walks Vivian. A first for both of them. Sharing a bathroom. Vivian steps up to the sink beside her.

DOROTHY
Mrs. Mitchell.

VIVIAN MITCHELL
Dorothy.

Cold silence.	Then...

DOROTHY
You’re working late tonight.

VIVIAN MITCHELL
Seems to always happen that way.

DOROTHY
Yes.	Seems to.

Vivian needs a paper towel, none left on her side. Dorothy hands her one. More silence. Then...

VIVIAN MITCHELL
I hear the IBM is at full capacity.

DOROTHY
Appears so.
 




(CONTINUED)
 
	97	.

CONTINUED:

VIVIAN MITCHELL
You certainly have a knack for it.

DOROTHY
My father taught me a thing or two about mechanics.

VIVIAN MITCHELL
You know, I have a few girls in the East Group who have an interest in knowin’ more about it.

DOROTHY
It is the future.

VIVIAN MITCHELL
I may bring ‘em by, if it’s all the same to you.

DOROTHY
That’s not my decision. That would be the supervisor’s.

VIVIAN MITCHELL
Yes.	That’s true.

Dorothy finishes up.

DOROTHY
Well.	Good night, Mrs. Mitchell.

Dorothy heads out.

VIVIAN MITCHELL
You know, Dorothy...

She stops, turns.

VIVIAN MITCHELL (CONT’D) Despite what you may think...I have nothin’ against ya’ll.

Dorothy takes this in.	Then:

DOROTHY
I know. I know you probably believe that.

Dorothy smiles at her. And then she walks out. Leaving Vivian to absorb the truth of Dorothy’s words.

EXT. KATHERINE’S HOUSE - NIGHT - LATER

Katherine slugs up the walkway to her house. She waves goodbye to Dorothy and Mary pulling away.

INT. KATHERINE’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Katherine steps in to find, Joylette (Mom,) Joylette (10,) Kathy and Constance sitting at the dinner table wearing their best dresses. The table is set, the room bathed in candlelight.

KATHERINE
Please tell me I didn’t miss a birthday.

Jim Johnson steps in from the kitchen, wearing an apron, holding a frying pan.

JIM JOHNSON
Good evening, Mrs. Goble.

KATHERINE
(hmmm.)

Jim.

The girls help Katherine take off her coat, lead her to the table.

CONSTANCE
Madame...your seat.

KATHERINE
Is it my birthday?

The girls giggle. Katherine sits. Constance pushes her seat in. Kathy puts a napkin in her lap. Katherine looks to her Mom.

KATHERINE (CONT’D)
Are you going to say anything?

JOYLETTE COLEMAN
It’s not my place.

Jim sits next to Katherine. It’s quiet. Katherine looks them all over. Then:

KATHERINE
Okay, I’m not going to do this all night...
 





(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

The Girls eye motion to something sitting on the table right in front of Katherine. She finally looks down...and sees a small box damn near under her nose. She knows what it is.

KATHERINE (CONT’D)
Oh, mother of mercy.	That’s for me.

Everyone nods. Jim takes the box. Then...gets down on one knee. Instant tears come to Katherine’s eyes.

KATHY
Are you sad, Momma?

The girls comfort her.

JOYLETTE (10)
It’s okay, Momma.

CONSTANCE
He’s a good man.

KATHERINE
I know. I know. I just. I can’t help it.

More tears.

KATHY
He hasn’t even asked you yet.

KATHERINE
He’s going to.

She looks at Jim.

KATHERINE (CONT’D)
Is that what you’re going to do?

JIM JOHNSON
If anyone will let me.

CONSTANCE
Go on then.	She’s already crying.

Jim opens the box: a classic, handmade diamond ring.

JIM JOHNSON
This was my mother’s ring. She and my father were married-

Joylette (10) cuts him off.

JOYLETTE (10)
For 52 years.

Jim looks at Joylette (10).	Are you going to let me do this?

JIM JOHNSON
I figure it’s about as lucky a ring as you can get.

Jim takes the ring.	Takes Katherine’s hand.

JIM JOHNSON (CONT’D)
The day I met you, I called my mother and asked her if I could have it. I said, “Mom, I met the woman I want to marry.”

Katherine cries more.	Kathy butts in:

KATHY
What’d she say?

JIM JOHNSON
She said, “She must be something, Jimmy.

Really something.”

Everyone’s enrapt in the story.	Constance:

CONSTANCE
What did you say?

JIM JOHNSON
I said, “She’s not something. She’s everything.”

Jim puts the ring on Katherine’s finger.

JIM JOHNSON (CONT’D)
I planned on this being more romantic. I’ll make that up to you real soon. But I know marrying you...includes the girls as well.

Joylette (Mom) clears her throat.

JOYLETTE COLEMAN
Amen to that.

Katherine takes Jim’s hands.

KATHERINE
I do.

Harrison is surrounded by piles of work.	Katherine steps in.

KATHERINE
You wanted to see me, sir?

AL HARRISON
Have a seat.

This is serious.	She obliges.

KATHERINE
Something wrong, Mr. Harrison?

AL HARRISON
No. There’s nothing wrong. In fact our IBM is churning out numbers in fractions of the time any human can. Present company included.

KATHERINE
That’s good then.

AL HARRISON
Maybe. The thing is, the Cape is now insisting on doing all the backups down there. On site.

Oh, boy.

KATHERINE
I see.

AL HARRISON
So, we won’t be running backups here. And truth be told, we can’t keep up with that IBM anyhow.

Katherine can barely move.

AL HARRISON (CONT’D)
Long story short, we no longer need a computer in this department. Progress is a double edged sword.

Harrison is struggling.	Hard to look her in the eyes.

AL HARRISON (CONT’D)
Let’s have you report back to the West Group for now. We’ll see if we can find another assignment.

KATHERINE
Thank you, sir.

All the effort. All the work. Gone in a split. Katherine stands.

AL HARRISON
I’m sorry about this, Katherine. It’s out of my hands, if you can believe it.

KATHERINE
I understand.

Katherine walks out.	She doesn’t say good-bye.

KATHERINE’S DESK - LATER

Katherine’s gathering her things. Putting her belongings in a file box. Ruth walks over, with a small present.

RUTH

RUTH
Mr. Harrison’s idea really. Beats the fake ones, that’s for certain.

Katherine’s holding back a flood of tears.	Ruth rambles:

RUTH (CONT’D)
Although I suspect his wife did the picking out. I can’t imagine he has an eye for such things...

As Ruth carries on, Katherine takes it all in: the Space Task Group bustles around her. Never stopping. Never slowing down. Stafford is at the board, conferring with Other Engineers.

RUTH (CONT’D)
Now you have a great wedding. You did good work around here.

Katherine looks up at Harrison’s bubble.	He’s on the phone.
He makes eye contact with her.	Nods a thank you.

INT. MCCLEAN BAPTIST CHURCH - ANOTHER DAY

Katherine’s standing in front of a mirror, adjusting the pearl necklace. She studies it in the reflection. We pull out to reveal...she’s dressed in white. Immaculate. Her wedding day. Dorothy and Mary join her in the reflection.

KATHERINE
I don’t think I could feel a thing the first time I did this.

DOROTHY
You look even more beautiful than you did back then.

KATHERINE
You think so?

DOROTHY
Just a little older.

MARY

Harrison escorts Katherine into the room: the Engineers at control stations, the massive screens, the live feeds, tracking stations, tech details, etc. The energy. Katherine’s in awe. This is the culmination of her work.

SAM TURNER
(calls out to Harrison)

Sir, we’ve got Pad 14 at the Cape on the line.

Harrison hits a button on the intercom.

Langley’s on the phone.

JOHN GLENN
Right on time.

John Glenn stalks over.

SCOTT CARPENTER (ON PHONE)
What do you say, Langley?

Harrison pipes up:

AL HARRISON (ON MIC)
We can confirm the Go/No Go point for re-entry is 16.11984, -165.2356. The launch window is a go. The landing coordinates match.

John Glenn answers himself.

JOHN GLENN (ON PHONE)
Good to hear that, Al. Hard to trust something you can’t look in the eyes.

The whole Team lights up at the sound of John Glenn’s voice.

AL HARRISON (ON MIC) That’s right, Colonel. Katherine did manage to calculate a few decimal points further than that hunk of metal.

JOHN GLENN (ON PHONE)
I’ll take every digit ya got. Be sure to thank her for me.

AL HARRISON (ON MIC)
Copy that.	Good luck, Friendship 7.
We’ll see you in the Bahamas.

JOHN GLENN (ON PHONE)
God speed, Langley.

CAPE CANAVERAL - CONTINUOUS

The rocket blasts off the pad.	Heads toward the heavens.
People stare in awe.

JOHN GLENN (V.O.)
We’re programming into a roll.

MISSION CONTROL COMMANDER (V.O)
Roger that.

JOHN GLENN (V.O.)
It’s getting bumpy along here.

MISSION CONTROL COMMANDER (V.O.)
Roger that.	You are in Max Q.

THE WEST COMPUTERS - CONTINUOUS

No one moves:

JOHN GLENN (V.O.)
Roger that, smoothing out real fine.

HARRISON, KATHERINE AND THE TRACKING TEAM - CONTINUOUS

JOHN GLENN (V.O.)
Zero G.	Feeling fine.	I feel fine.

Harrison rubs his eyes.

MISSION CONTROL COMMANDER (V.O.)
Go for SECO.

The rocket becomes an indiscernible blaze high in the air on the screen.

JOHN GLENN (V.O.)
Roger that.

And then...it’s gone.

CAPE CANAVERAL - CONTINUOUS

The crowd is silent.

HARRISON, KATHERINE AND THE TRACKING TEAM

Harrison cracks his neck.	The silence is torture.	Then:

JOHN GLENN (V.O.)
Oh, that view is tremendous.

And, John Glenn’s in space.	A collective sigh of relief.

MISSION CONTROL COMMANDER (V.O.) Roger, that, Friendship 7. You are go for orbit.

The journey has just begun. Harrison finally turns to the screens.

AL HARRISON
10.5 hours to go. If we make 7 round trips.

He sits down.	A rare event.

AL HARRISON (CONT’D)
I need a coffee.

Assistants scramble.
 
	112	.



INT. WEST COMPUTER ROOM - LATER

The Computers are packing up for the day.	Heading home.
Dorothy’s the last.	She shuts off the TV.

Vivian Mitchell enters.	Envelope in hand, she holds it out.

VIVIAN MITCHELL
New assignment came down the pike.

Dorothy takes the envelope.	Doesn’t want to open it.

VIVIAN MITCHELL (CONT’D) Always changin’ ‘round here. Hard to keep up.

Dorothy opens the envelope. Reads. Poker-faced. She looks up to Vivian.

VIVIAN MITCHELL (CONT’D)
Seems like they’re gonna need a permanent team to feed that IBM.

DOROTHY
How big of a team?

VIVIAN MITCHELL
30 to start.

They stare at each other for the longest time. An understanding between them. Some growth. But mostly...respect.

DOROTHY
Thank you for the information, Mrs.

Mitchell.

VIVIAN MITCHELL
You’re quite welcome...Mrs. Vaughan.

Mrs. Vaughan? Yes. She called her Mrs. Vaughan. Vivian walks out.

Dorothy opens the letter and re-reads:

INSERT - Dorothy Vaughan, Transfer Assignment to: IBM
Computing Lab.	Position: Supervisor.

She walks to the door. Turns back. Takes one last look at her old digs: the adding machines, the mismatched desks...and finally the “Colored Computers” sign. And...she shuts off the lights.

TRACKING CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Harrison’s drinking coffee.	Katherine’s sitting in a chair.
Stafford is talking to TECHS.	Zielinski’s eating a sandwich.
Suddenly, a warning light blinks red.

JOHN GLENN (V.O.)
Capcom 7, I have a warning light.

THE FRIENDSHIP 7 CAPSULE - CONTINUOUS

John Glenn inspects his console.

MISSION CONTROL COMMANDER	(IN JOHN’S EAR)
Standby, Friendship 7.

TRACKING CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Zielinski turns to Harrison.

ZIELINSKI
It’s the heat shield lock, Al.

AL HARRISON
What are we looking at, Stafford?

STAFFORD
The heat shield may have come loose.

MISSION CONTROL COMMANDER (V.O.) 7, will you confirm the landing bag is in the OFF position?

THE FRIENDSHIP 7 CAPSULE - CONTINUOUS

John Glenn checks:

JOHN GLENN
Affirmative, Capcom.

MISSION CONTROL COMMANDER (IN JOHN’S EAR)
Have you heard any banging noises or

anything of this type at higher rates?

JOHN GLENN
That’s a negative.

TRACKING CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Stafford is a mess:
 






(CONTINUED)
 
	114	.

CONTINUED:

STAFFORD
We need to get him down, now. We could burn up on re-entry.

Harrison considers.	Then:

AL HARRISON
Get Hawaii Capcom.

EXT. GRAMMAR SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS

Mary’s outside her kids’ school, scanning the dozens of children for her little ones.

Levi, Jr. and Carolyn Marie break through the crowd. Hug their Momma.

MARY
Gotta hurry, bunny rabbits. There’s a man in space. We don’t want to miss it.

Mary stops in her tracks. Across the street: a CROWD is gathering in front of an appliance store window full of TVs. Anxiety. Worry on faces. A MAN yells:

MAN
Something’s wrong with Glenn.

Mary pulls her kids that way.

APPLIANCE STORE WINDOW - CONTINUOUS

The TV Newscaster:

NEWSCASTER
We’ve just learned, the Friendship 7 is in danger of losing its heat shield.

Mary and her kids, step up to the window.	This is bad.

MARY
(talks to the TV)

Tell them not to jettison the retro-package.

INT. DOROTHY’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

Dorothy’s driving home. Listening to the radio newscast of the mission. She turns the volume up.
 







(CONTINUED)
 
	115	.

CONTINUED:

NEWSCASTER (ON RADIO)
NASA is confirming this is some sort of malfunction with the capsule’s heat shield and it may not stay in place. This doesn’t look good for John Glenn, America’s hero...is in danger.

TRACKING CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Panic.	Stafford’s on the phone.	Harrison’s talking at him.

AL HARRISON
Tell them not to jettison the retro-package. If the heat shield is loose, the retro-package straps might hold it in place.

PAUL STAFFORD
Hawaii.	This is Langely...

He waits.

PAUL STAFFORD (CONT’D)
(quietly)

Oh, God.	It’s got to work.

KATHERINE
It will work. The retro pack will hold it until the re-entry pressure secures the shield.

Katherine gives Stafford a supportive nod.

APPLIANCE STORE WINDOW - CONTINUOUS

Mary talks to the TV.

MARY
He has to override the 05g.

TRACKING CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The air doesn't move. Zielinski’s also on the phone. He hollers out:

ZIELINSKI
He has to override the 05g.

MISSION CONTROL COMMANDER (V.O.)
Friendship 7, we’re recommending that the retro-package NOT, I say again, NOT be jettisoned. This means that you will have to override the 05g switch.
 


(CONTINUED)
 
	116	.

CONTINUED:

JOHN GLENN (V.O.)
Ah, Roger, that command. I’ll have to make a manual 05g entry, and bring the scope in.

AL HARRISON
He knows.

INT. DOROTHY’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

Driving.	Listening to the radio.

NEWSCASTER (ON RADIO)
Without a heat shield, there’s no way for
John Glenn to get back through the

Earth’s atmosphere.

Dorothy sees cars in the middle of the road, pulled over on the shoulder, traffic stopped. Time stopped. PEOPLE are looking up to the sky. Some are on their knees: praying. Some crying.

TRACKING CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

All eyes on the screens:

MISSION CONTROL COMMANDER (V.O.) You're going to use fly-by-wire for reentry. You’ll need to maintain a zero angle. Over.

THE FRIENDSHIP 7 CAPSULE - CONTINUOUS

John Glenn is oddly calm.

JOHN GLENN
Ah, Roger. I'm on fly-by-wire, back-it up with manual. Over.

MISSION CONTROL COMMANDER (IN JOHN’S EAR)
Roger.	The weather in the recovery area:
3-foot waves, 10 miles visibility.

JOHN GLENN
Roger.	You're ground--
(static)

--you are going out--

TRACKING CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Harrison rubs his whole head.	Stafford is damn near shaking.
 




(CONTINUED)
 
	117	.

CONTINUED:

STAFFORD
He’s crossing the communication black-out zone.

AL HARRISON
Keep talking to him.

MISSION CONTROL COMMANDER (V.O.)
Seven, do you copy?

JOHN GLENN (V.O.)
I think the package just let go. Do you copy? There’s a real fireball outside and--

John Glenn cuts off abruptly.	The room is flattened.

KATHERINE
Please, God.

MISSION CONTROL COMMANDER (V.O.)
Friendship 7.	Do you copy?	Over.

Nothing.	Stafford bends over, head in his hands.

Harrison walks over to the microphone.	Leans down to it.
Listens.

MISSION CONTROL COMMANDER (V.O.)
Friendship 7, do you copy?	Over.

Nothing.

CAPE CANAVERAL - CONTINUOUS

Hundreds of people are silent outside the gates.

MISSION CONTROL COMMANDER (V.O.)
Friendship 7, do you copy?	Over.

EXT. SIDE OF THE ROAD - CONTINUOUS

Dorothy’s out of her car. Amongst the crowd. White, black, united. She gets down on her knees. The Radio broadcast echoes from the dozens of cars.
 
	118	.



APPLIANCE STORE WINDOW - CONTINUOUS

The window reflects Mary and her kids...and the other frozen faces.

TRACKING CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Nothing moves.	No one breathes.	The air is still.

MISSION CONTROL COMMANDER (V.O.)
Friendship 7, do you copy?	Over.

Still nothing.	Harrison turns away from the screen.

And then miraculously:

JOHN GLENN (V.O.)
Loud and clear, Capcom.

Cheers of relief.

MISSION CONTROL COMMANDER (V.O.)
Roger that.	How are you doing?

JOHN GLENN (V.O.)
My condition is good. But that was a real fireball, boy.

Stafford sinks into his chair, overwhelmed.

MISSION CONTROL COMMANDER Roger that. Let’s get you all the way home.

JOHN GLENN (V.O.)
Roger. Here’s hoping these landing coords still hold.

Harrison looks over at Katherine, she’s on her tip toes.
Leaning, as if wishing the capsule on trajectory.

MISSION CONTROL COMMANDER Approaching 16.119.

JOHN GLENN (V.O.)
Roger.

MISSION CONTROL COMMANDER Approaching -165.23. In 3, 2, 1.

JOHN GLENN (V.O.)
Engaging chutes.
 



(CONTINUED)
 
	119	.

CONTINUED:

And then, on the screen, Friendship 7 comes into view. The parachute deploying.

JOHN GLENN (V.O.)
How do I look, Capcom?

MISSION CONTROL COMMANDER
Standby 7.

An Engineer hands the Mission Commander a calculation. He cross checks the coordinates. Then:

MISSION CONTROL COMMANDER (CONT’D) Your Go/No Go is good. Landing coordinates are spot on, 7.

Katherine breaths.	Her numbers stood the test.

JOHN GLENN
Roger that, Capcom. Always wanted to swim in the Bahamas. Over.

Katherine smiles over at a relieved Harrison.

CAPE CANAVERAL - CONTINUOUS

The Crowd erupts.	Men shake the fence.

MISSION CONTROL COMMANDER (V.O.) Friendship 7, we have you in our sights. The Navy is en route to recover.

EXT. SIDE OF THE ROAD - CONTINUOUS

Women are crying. Men hold kids. Dorothy smiles up at the sky.

RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
John Glenn has splashed-down and is being recovered.

APPLIANCE STORE WINDOW - CONTINUOUS

Mary screams out in joy.

MARY
Thank you, GOD!

The Crowd echoes the sentiment.

EXT. UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA CAMPUS - ANOTHER DAY

Mary’s in cap and gown, post graduation. She runs into the waiting arms of: Katherine and Dorothy. Happiest day of her life. The women celebrate, laugh. Karl Zielinski tips his hat to Mary. Smiles at her.

Mary takes off her cap and throws it high into the sky.

Titles over: “Mary Jackson went on to obtain her Master’s degree in engineering from the University of Virginia.

She became the first female engineer...of any color at NASA.”

INT. DOROTHY’S CAR - LATER

Dorothy’s driving home.

Titles over: “Dorothy Vaughan became the Head of Langley’s centralized Electronic Computing Group, as NASA’s first black Supervisor. In 1964 she joined the Scout Team, working to send unmanned explorers to Mars.”

INT. IBM COMPUTER ROOM - SOME TIME LATER

Dorothy’s standing in front of the mainframe, her sleeves rolled up. Vivian Mitchell walks in with a GROUP OF TRANSFER EMPLOYEES. Black and white. All women.

VIVIAN MITCHELL
Girls. This is Mrs. Vaughan. Your supervisor. She’ll show you how things work.

Dorothy looks over her new employees.

DOROTHY
Ladies...better roll those sleeves up.

This here is manual labor.

TRACKING CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

A celebration.	Engineers hug each other.	Cigars are lit.
Somewhere champagne pops.	Harrison walks over to Katherine.

AL HARRISON
Nice work, Katherine.

He offers her his hand.	They shake.

KATHERINE
You too, Mr. Harrison.
 




(CONTINUED)
 
	121	.

CONTINUED:

He smiles, for the first time. Ever. Underneath it all...Harrison’s a kid:

AL HARRISON
You think we can get to the moon?

Katherine nods, with all the certainty in the world:

KATHERINE
We’re already there, sir.

Titles over: “In 1962 Katherine Johnson became a permanent member of the Space Task Group. She went on to perform the calculations for Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins’s, Apollo 11 flight to the moon. A year later, her backup calculations proved critical to the successful effort to rescue the astronauts in the damaged Apollo 13 spacecraft. In 2015, Katherine was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

INT. SPACE TASK GROUP - A YEAR LATER

The Space Task Group is all but empty. Katherine finishes typing a report: “Notes on Space Technology” by, Paul Stafford...and...Katherine Johnson. She pulls the cover page out of the typewriter, sets it on top of the rest of the manuscript.

Stafford walks over, puts a cup of coffee on Katherine’s desk. Picks up the report. He walks off.

Katherine sips her coffee.	Another day at work.

FADE OUT.
