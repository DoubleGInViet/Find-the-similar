INT. ROB'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

STEREO

Not a minisystem, not a matching set, but coveted audiophile clutter of McIntosh and Nakamichi, each component from a different era, bought piece by piece in various nanoseconds of being flush.

ROB (V.O.)
What came first?	The music or the
misery?	People worry about kids
playing with guns and watching violent
videos, we're scared that some sort
of culture of violence is taking
them over...

RECORDS

Big thin LPs. Fields of them. We move across them, slowly... they seem to come to rest in an end of a few books... but then the CD's start, and go on, faster and faster, forever then the singles, then the tapes...

ROB (V.O.)
But nobody worries about kids
listening to thousands -- literally
thousands -- of songs about broken
hearts and rejection and pain and
misery and loss.

It seems the records, tapes, and CD's will never end until...

we come to ROB -- always a hair out of place, a face that grows on you. He sits in an oversized beanbag chair and addresses us, the wall of music behind him.

ROB
Did I listen to pop music because I
was miserable, or was I miserable
because I listened to pop music?

INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

Group of bags huddled next to the door.	Not the go-on-
 
vacation set, but the clothes-to-coffee-maker moving out variety. Rob stares at them, his face unreadable, his head gripped by a big pair Boudokan headphones. We hear what he is hearing, something foreboding and upbeat at the same time.

LAURA, Rob's girlfriend, enters the room, and he immediately pulls the headphones off. She clocks him for a moment, catching him in what seems to be an old and repeated moment of nonpresence. She begins to heft the bags, Rob goes to her, a little tardy for his big goodbye. Laura begins to cry a bit.

LAURA

I don't really know what I'm doing.

He smiles, and she doesn't.	He adjusts.

ROB

You don't have to go this second.
You can stay until whenever.

LAURA
We've done the hard part now.	I
might as well, you know...

ROB

Well stay for tonight, then.

Laura shakes her head, lifts the last small bag, and backs out the door. A strap catches on a handle and the two of them wrestle with it a bit, while trying to keep the door open, until Laura awkwardly disappears from view and the door shuts behind Rob. He stays right there staring at the shut door for a long moment, listening to the fading sound of Laura and her dragging bags.

STEREO

Rob's left hand cranks the volume knob while his right switches the CD changer to something loud and adrenal. He addresses us again.

ROB

My desert-island, all-time, top five
most memorable break-ups, in
chronological order are as follows:

Alison Ashworth, Penny Hardwick,
Jackie Allen, Charlie Nicholson,

Sarah Kendrew.

INT. APARTMENT STAIRWELL

Laura drags her bags, banging down the stairs --

INT. ROB'S APARTMENT

Rob moves around the apartment, seeming to expand physically, looking for change as he continues.
 
ROB
Those were the ones that really hurt.

Can you see your name in that list,
Laura?	Maybe you'd sneak into the
top ten, but there's no place for
you in the top five.	Sorry.	Those
places are reserved for the kind of

humiliations and heartbreaks that
you're just not capable of delivering.

He adjusts the angle of the TV, stuffs a creepy family portrait into a drawer.

ROB

That probably sounds crueler than
it's meant to, but the fact is, we're
too old to take each other miserable.

Unhappiness used to mean something.
Now it's just a drag like a cold or

having no money.

He moves through the living room to an open window facing the street. Looking down two stories, he sees Laura emerge from the building and drag her bags toward her car across the street.

ROB

If you really wanted to mess me up,
you should have got to me earlier.

CUT TO:

EXT. SUBURBAN PARK - DUSK -

Rob and Alison sit on the bench, kissing awkwardly.

ROB (V.O.)

Which brings us to number one.	Alison
Ashworth.

PARK BENCH - DUSK

The same shot, the next night: new clothes, same clumsy make-out session.

ROB (V.O.)
My relationship with Alison Ashworth
lasted six hours.

PARK BENCH - DUSK

...Next night...

ROB (V.O.)

The two hours after school and before
The Rockford Files, three days in a
row.	On the fourth afternoon.

SAME PARK BENCH
 
...And the fourth night...

ROB (V.O.)
Kevin Bannister.

Alison and another boy, KEVIN BANNISTER. Kissing. In the background, Rob approaches and stops. He implodes with self-consciousness and humiliation and attempts to affect a casual gait as he mopes away.

ROB (V.O.)
It would be nice to think that since
I was fourteen, times have changed,
relationships have become more
sophisticated, females less cruel,
skins thicker, but there still seems
to be an element of that afternoon

in everything that has happened to
me since.	All my other romantic

stories seem to be a scrambled version
of that first one.

INT. ROB'S APARTMENT

Rob sits in his chair, a cord leading from the stereo to headphones draped around his neck. Behind him is the wall of music.

ROB

Number two.	Penny Hardwick.	Penny
was great-looking, and her top five
recording artists were Carly Simon,

Carole King, James Taylor, Cat
Stevens, and Elton John...

He lets the needle down on the turntable next to him.

"Nobody Does It Better" by Carly Simon begins to play as

PRESENCE...

EXT. HIGH SCHOOL LAWN - FLASHBACK - MOS

...and continues as SOUNDTRACK. PENNY, 16, is walking across the grass toward us. She's the clean, sporty, nice wholesome girl-next-door. She waves to off-camera friends, smiling a winning smile.

ROB (V.O.)

Everybody liked her.	She was nice.
Nice manners.	Nice grades.	Nice-
looking.

INT. PENNY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Penny and Rob sit on the edge of the bed, kissing. Rob moves his hand up toward the breast, but the hand then seems to have a new idea, and dives south to follow the thigh into Penny's skirt...
 
ROB (V.O.)
She was so nice, in fact, that she

wouldn't let me put my hand
underneath, or even on top of, her
bra.

...when he contacts skin, Penny rolls like a gymnast away and off of the bed, out of frame. Rob looks away balefully.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

"Nobody Does It Better" continues as Rob walks Penny to her front door. She is smiling, he seems distant.

ROB (V.O.)
Penny was nice, but I wasn't
interested in nice, just breasts,

and therefore she was no good to me.
And so I was finished with her.

She leans in to kiss him, and he shrugs her off.

ROB
What's the point?	It never goes
anywhere.

Without looking at her, Rob turns and walks down the street, getting smaller. Penny watches for a while.

CUT TO:

INT. "EL" TRAIN CAR - MORNING - PRESENT

Rob sways with the other commuters.

ROB
She cried, and I hated her for it,
because she made me feel bad.	I
started dating a girl who everybody
said would put out, and Penny went
with this asshole Chris Thompson who
told me that he had sex with her

after something like three dates.
How had Penny gone from a girl who
wouldn't do anything to a girl who
would do everything?

A BUSINESSMAN looks up from his paper at Rob, then back down.

EXT. CLARK STREET - DAY

An old Chicago block of local merchants, on a busy street.

Rob makes his way down the street, jangling a set of keys and talking to us.

ROB

My store's right up here.	It's called
The Record Exchange.	It's carefully
placed to attract the bare minimum
 
of window shoppers.

Rob arrives at a storefront, and begins unlocking a rusty gate with two locks and then a beaten-down door.

ROB
I get by because of the people who
make a special effort to shop here
on Saturday young men, always young
men, who spend a disproportionate
amount of their time looking for
deleted Smiths singles and "original

not rereleased" underline Frank Zappa
albums.

INT. RECORD STORE - DAY

In almost darkness. More light might penetrate the windows if there weren't so many record-release posters taped to them. A dusty narrow corridor clad in burlap and shag rug. On the walls are bagged 45's you will never hear unless you commit your life to the losing proposition of listening to every noodling of Jah Wobble and Glen Glenn and other people you've never heard of.

But as Rob opens the door, enters, and flips a switch causing the fluorescents to sputter, we see in his eyes the reverence and earnestness of a football coach gazing across an empty field or a priest drawn at midnight to his empty church.

ROB
The fetish properties are not unlike
porn.	I would feel guilty taking
their money if I wasn't, kind of,

well, one of them.

As he walks one of the two slim aisles toward the back, he stops on a dime, steps back and pulls a CD from the sea and

replaces it almost the same position, but not quite -- meticulousness and pride in this gesture...

After a moment the door creaks open behind Rob, admitting DICK, a nervous, forlorn but sweet and intelligent discophile with long greasy black hair, a Sonic Youth T-shirt, a monstrous pair of headphones, and a canvas record bag emblazoned with a label logo.

ROB

'Morning, Dick.

DICK

Oh, hi.	Hi, Rob.

ROB
Good weekend?

DICK
Yeah, OK.	I found the first Licorice
Comfits album at Vintage Vinyl.	The
 
one on Testament of Youth.	Never
released here.	Japanese import only.

ROB

Great.

DICK

I'll tape it for you.

ROB
No, that's okay.	Really.

DICK
'Cause you like their second one,
you said, Pop, Girls. etc.	The one
with Cheryl Ladd on the cover.	You
didn't see the cover though.

ROB

Yeah, I haven't really absorbed that
one.

DICK
Well, I'll just make it for you.

ROB
(resigned)
Okay.

CUT TO:

INT. RECORD STORE - LATER

Dick is behind the counter, Rob in the aisles with a clipboard doing inventory.

ROB

(re: music)
What's this?

DICK
The new Belle and Sebastian.	Like
it?

The door flies open and BARRY, an acid-tongued post-punk rock misanthrope without quite enough intelligence to conceptualize his own rebellion, walks in. His teeth are clenched in air-guitar concentration and he's phonetically cranking a Clash riff:

BARRY
BAA!	BA BA DANG!

Dick shrinks back from him instinctively. He stops mid-step and cocks his ear at the music playing in the store. His face adopts an exaggerated grimace.

BARRY
Holy Shiite!	What the fuck's this?
 
DICK
It's the new --

ROB

It's the record we've been listening
to and enjoying, Barry.

Barry moves in on the stereo behind the counter, and Dick gets out of his way.

BARRY
Well that's problematic because it
sucks ass.

He pops the CD out and frisbees it to Dick.

BARRY

(re: the CD)
Yours, I assume...

Barry pulls a tape out of his jacket and jams it in. "How to Kill a Radio Consultant" by Public Enemy comes through at through the red levels.

ROB
(over the blare)
TURN IT OFF, BARRY.

BARRY

IT WON'T GO ANY LOUDER.

Barry walks in rhythm toward the stockroom and disappears.

Rob goes behind the counter and stops the tape. Barry's head pops out of the stockroom.

BARRY

What are you doing?

ROB
I don't want to hear Public Enemy
right now.

BARRY

Public Enemy!	All I'm trying to do
is cheer us up.	Go ahead and put on
some old sad bastard music see if I

care.

ROB
I don't want old sad bastard music
either.	I just want something I can

ignore.

BARRY
But it's my new tape.	My Monday
morning tape.	I made it last night

just for today.

ROB
 
Yeah, well it's fucking Monday
afternoon.	You should get out of

bed earlier.

BARRY
Don't you want to hear what's next?

ROB
What's next?

BARRY
Play it.

ROB

Say it.

BARRY

(sighs)
"Little Latin Lupe Lu."

Rob groans.

DICK
Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels?

BARRY
(defensive)
No.	The Righteous Brothers.

DICK
Oh well.	Nevermind.

Barry bristles and moves slowly in on Dick.

BARRY
What?

DICK
Nothing.

BARRY
No, not nothing.	What's wrong with
the Righteous Brothers?

DICK
Nothing.	I just prefer the other
one.

BARRY

Bullshit.

ROB

How can it be bullshit to state a
preference?

BARRY
Since when did this shop become a

fascist regime?

ROB
 
Since you brought that bullshit tape
in.

BARRY

(sarcastic)
Great.	That's the fun of working in
a record store.	Playing crappy pap

you don't want to listen to.	I
thought this tape was going to be,
you know, a conversation stimulator.
I was going to ask you for your top
five records to play on a Monday

morning and all that, and you just
had to ruin it.

ROB
We'll do it next Monday.

BARRY

Well what's the point in that?

From outside. HEAR THE SOUND OF SKATEBOARD WHEELS CLACKING AND SCRAPING, GETTING LOUDER. Rob, Dick and Barry stop fighting to listen, then each moves purposefully to a spot in the store. Dick to the register, Barry to the back, Rob next to the door, as if bracing for a street fight.

The SOUND gets closer, then stops. The door swings open to admit VINCE and JUSTIN, two fifteen-year-old skate punks.

Vince's hair is post-apocolyptically hacked to different lengths, Justin's in uniformly shaven with leopard spots dyed browse. Rob follows them, watching their every move.

Dick counters from his perch, getting another angle. Barry cracks his knuckles threateningly. Vince and Justin do their best browser impersonations. Finally Justin plucks a CD, and the two move to the counter.

ROB
Hey.	Didn't you steal that one
already?

DICK

Can I help you?

JUSTIN

Just this.

DICK
That'll be fifteen-twenty-seven.

Vince reaches into	his deep pocket and pulls out a paper
cup, with piece	of	paper attached that says "Please help me.
I'm retarded."	He	pours a mass of change and crumpled singles
onto the counter.	Dick begins counting it out.
		VINCE
Isn't	your name Dick?
 
DICK
Yes.

VINCE

That sucks.	Get it?

Dick cracks a sad smile for a second. He bags the CD and Vince and Justin are off. Rob walks back through the stock room door.

CUT TO:

INT. RECORD STORE - STOCK ROOM - LATER

Rob is on his knees, opening boxes with a razor knife. He talks to us as he works.

ROB
I'm sick of the sight of this place,

to be honest.	Some days I'm afraid --

Dick sticks his head in the door, looks at Rob, looks where Rob is looking (camera), and retreats back through the door.

Rob continues.

ROB

I'm afraid I'll go berserk, rip the
Elvis Costello mobile from the
ceiling, throw the "Country Artists
Male A-K" rack out onto the streets,
go off to work in a Virgin Megastore

and never come back --

He hears the bell on the front door RING, and he stops and listens, looks a bit worried.

CUSTOMER (O.S.)
I'm looking for a record for my
daughter.	For her birthday.	"I
Just Called To Say I Love You." Do
you have it?

BARRY (O.S.)

Oh yeah.	We got it.

Rob relaxes and goes back to work.

CUSTOMER (O.S.)

Great.	Can I have it then?

BARRY (O.S.)

No, you can't.

Rob deflates, shaking his head.

STORE FLOOR

Barry leans back, elbows up on the counter behind him, talking to the CUSTOMER, a middle-aged graying man in a raincoat.
 
CUSTOMER

Why not?

BARRY
Because it's sentimental tacky crap,
that's why not.	Do we look like the

kind of store that sells "I Just
Called To Say I Loved You?" Go to
the mall and stop wasting our time.

CUSTOMER

What's your problem?	What did I...
Why are you --

BARRY
Do you even know your daughter?
There is no way she likes that song.
Or is she in a coma?

The Customer throws up his hands and starts out of the store.

CUSTOMER
Okay, okay, buddy.	I didn't know it
was Pick On the Middle-Aged Square
Guy Day.	My apologies.	I'll be on
my way.

He steps out of the door.

BARRY
B'Bye!

Outside, anger catches up to the Customer. He turns and throws up a middle finger --

CUSTOMER

FUCK YOU!

--	and bolts.  Barry smiles and turns to see

ROB

standing in the doorway of the stock room. He feigns applause.

ROB

Nice, Barry.

BARRY
Rob.	Top five musical crimes
perpetrated by Stevie Wonder in the

'80's and '90's.	Subquestion -- is
it in fact unfair to criticize a
formerly great artist for his latter-
day sins?	"Is it better to burn out
than to fade away?"

ROB

You just drove a fucking customer
 
away, Barry.

BARRY
We didn't even really have it.	I
happen to know for a fact that the
only Stevie Wonder single we have is
"Don't Drive Drunk." I was just

goofing on the straight, and it never
cost you a penny.

ROB
Not the point.

BARRY

Oh, so what's the point then?

ROB

I don't want you talking to our
customers like that again.

BARRY
"Our customers?" You think that Mr.

L.L.	Bean out there is going to be a regular?

Rob's face begins to redden with anger.

ROB
Barry, I'm fucking broke!	I know we
used to fuck with anyone who asked
for anything we didn't like, but
it's gotta stop.

BARRY

Bullshit.	The guy was going to buy
one record -- which we didn't even
have -- and leave and never come

back again anyway.	Why not have a
little fun?	Big fucking deal.

ROB
What did he ever do to you?

BARRY

He offended me with his terrible
taste.

ROB
It wasn't even his terrible taste.

It was his daughter's.

BARRY

Oh, now you're defending that
motherfucker?	You're going soft in
your old age, Rob.	There was a time
when you would have chased him out
of the store and up the street.	Now

all of a sudden I'm offending your
golf buddy.
(sarcastic)
 
You're right, Rob.	I am so sorry.
How are we ever going to make enough

money to get you and Laura into the
country club?

Rob is red and seething.

BARRY
And by the way, I tell you this for
your own good: That's the worst
sweater I've ever seen.	I have never
seen a sweater that bad worn by anyone

I'm on speaking terms with.	It's a
disgrace to the human race.

Rob springs on Barry, grabbing him by the lapels and jerking him up against the wall. Rob is so mad he can't say anything.

DICK

Hey, guys... Hey.

Rob runs out of steam and drops Barry, who backpedals fast.

BARRY

(extremely shaken)
What are you, some kind of fucking
maniac?	If this jacket's torn you're

gonna pay big.

Barry stomps out of the store. Rob turns and goes back to the stockroom, and sits on the stepladder. Dick appears in the doorway, terrified.

DICK

Are you all right?

ROB

Yeah.	I'm sorry... Look Dick, Laura
and I broke up.	She's gone.	And if
we ever see Barry again maybe you
can tell him that.

DICK
'Course I will, Rob.	No problem.
No problem at all.	I'll tell him
next time I see him.

Rob nods. Dick sets out into the uncharted conversational territory of interpersonal relationships.

DICK
I've ah... got some other stuff to
tell him anyway, so it's no problem.
I'll just tell him about, you know,
Laura, when I tell him the other
stuff.

ROB
Fine.
 
DICK
I'll start with your news before I

tell him mine, obviously.	Mine isn't
much, really, just about Marie LaSalle
(flashes CD of pretty
woman)
playing at Lounge Ax tonight.	I

like her, you know, she's kind of
Sheryl Crowish... but, you know,
good.	So I'll tell him before that.
Good news and bad news kind of thing.

Dick laughs nervously.

DICK
Or rather, bad news and good news,
because he likes this person playing

tonight.	I mean, he liked Laura
too, I didn't mean that.	And he

likes you.	It's just that --

ROB

I understand, Dick.

DICK
Sure.	'Course.	Rob, look.	Do you
want to... talk about it, that kind

of thing?

Rob looks up at Dick, who is so nervous that his brow is wet.

ROB
No.	Thanks though, Dick.

Dick sighs with relief, and smiles his way out of the stock room.

CUT TO:

ROB IN HIS CHAIR

Rob to camera.

ROB
Number three in the top five break-
ups was Charlie Nicholson, sophomore

year of college.	Some people never
got over 'Nam, or the night their

band opened for Nirvana.	I guess I
never really got over Charlie.

CUT TO:

EXT. COLLEGE QUAD - DAY - FLASHBACK

About twenty feet away we see a tall, thin beauty, bleach-blonde hair cropped short in darling '80's new-wave asymmetry.

She is speaking animatedly to a PAMPHLETEER, driving her
 
points home with a forefinger.

ROB (V.O.)
She looked different.	Dramatic.
Exotic.	She talked a lot, about
remarkably interesting things like
music, books, film, and politics...

INT. CAFE - DAY

A younger Rob sits amongst a group of STUDENTS who are engaged in a heated conversation. He is smiling, mouth closed, just happy to be there. Charlie sitting next to him, tousles his hair as she talks incessantly.

ROB (V.O.)
(over her talking)
...so we didn't have those terrible,
strained sentences, that seemed to

characterized most of my
relationships.	And she liked me.
She liked me.	She liked me.

Charlie gives Rob a quick kiss and keeps talking...

EXT. STREET - AFTERNOON

Rob and Charlie walk arm in arm, Rob in cool clothes and sunglasses trying to look cool, Charlie making a point about something.

Rob checks out how cool he looks with her as they walk by a store window REFLECTION.

ROB (V.O.)
We went out for two years, and for
every single minute I felt as though

I was standing on a dangerously narrow
ledge.	I couldn't get comfortable,
couldn't ever stretch out and relax.
Why would a girl -- no, a woman --
like Charlie go out with someone who

only a few years ago sewed a Foghat
patch on his jacket?	I felt like
all those people who suddenly shaved
their heads and said they'd always
been punks.	I felt like a fraud.

And I was depressed by the lack of
flamboyance in my wardrobe...

INT. CHARLIE'S APARTMENT - DAY

The fabulous sophomore design student's studio apartment:

White wood floor, white walls, overvarnished door, Doisneaux print on the wall, futon on the floor. Rob lies back on his elbows, watching Charlie in uncomfortable, worried awe. She stands, her back to him, wearing only her underwear and pulling on a T-shirt -- a heartbreaking image to look back on.
 
ROB (V.O.)

...I worried about my abilities as a
lover.	I was intimidated by the
other men in her design department,
and became convinced that she was
going to leave me for one of them.

Charlie turns around and looks at Rob with naked ambivalence.

ROB (V.O.)
She left me for one of them.	The
dreaded Marco.

EXT. CHARLIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

It is RAINING like crazy, and Rob is shouting up at a lit window, maniacally gesturing. The curtains part and Charlie's figure appears, clad only in a sheet. Next to her is a tall, built, handsome man, MARCO, also in a sheet.

Eventually he falls to his knees with a splash and buries his head in his hands. The light goes out.

	ROB	(V.O.)
And	I lost it.	I lost it all.
Dignity, faith,	fifteen pounds...
EXT. STREET -	NIGHT	
Rob wandering	through the	rain.

ROB (V.O.)
Any small idea of personal identity

that I had acquired up to that point.

INT. SOME RECORD STORE - DAY

A younger and catatonic Rob listlessly sorts through a stack of records.

ROB (V.O.)

I came to three months later, and to
my surprise had flunked out of school
and started working in a record store.

INT. ROB'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Rob stands in front of his wall of music, shifting LPs around between the shelves and piles on the floor as he talks to us.

ROB
What I really learned from the Charlie
Debacle is that you gotta punch your
weight.	Charlie was out of my Class:
too pretty, too smart, too witty,

too much.	What am I?	Average.	A
middleweight.	Not the smartest guy
in the world, but certainly not the
 
dumbest. I've read books like The Unbearable Lightness of Being, Angela's Ashes, and Love in the Time of Cholera, and understood them, I think -- they're about girls, right? -- just kidding -- but I don't like them very much. My all time top

five favorite books are Johnny Cash's
autobiography, Snow Crash by Neil
Stevenson, Zen and the Art of
Motorcycle Maintenance, The Trouser
Press Guides to Rock, and, I don't

know, probably something by Kurt
Vonnegut.	I look through the New
Yorker when my neighbor's done with
it, and I'm not averse to going down
to the Fine Arts to watch subtitles

films, although on the whole I prefer
American films.	Top five being Blade

Runner, Cool Hand Luke, the first
two Godfathers which we'll count as
one, Taxi Driver, and The Shining.

I'm okay looking, average height,
not skinny, not fat.	My genius, if
I can call it that, is to combine a
whole load of averageness into one
compact frame.	You might say there

were millions like me, but there
aren't, really: Alot of guys have
impeccable music taste but don't
read, alot of guys read but are really
fat, alot of guys are sympathetic to

women but have stupid beards, alot
of guys have a Woody Allen sense of

humor but look like Woody Allen.
Some drink too much, some drive like
assholes, some get into fights, or

show off money, or do drugs.	I don't
do any of these things, really.	If
I do okay with women it's not because
of the virtues I have, but because
of the ugly flaws I don't have...

So.	Charlie and I didn't match.
After her I was determined to never
get out of my league again.

INT. ROB'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Rob presses play on the answering machine. A pleasant, older female voice is heard. It's JANET, Laura's mother.

JANET

(on machine)
Hello, you two.	Laura, it's your
mother.	Your father's angina is a
little rough today and I thought
he'd like to talk to you.	No big

deal.	I love you two.	Bye.

Beep.
 
LIZ

(on machine)
Rob, it's Liz.	Just calling to see,
well, if you're okay.	Give me a
ring.	I'm not taking sides.	Yet.
Lot's of love.	Bye.

He pulls an LP from a shelf, puts it on the turntable and sits back in his chair.

EXT. LAKE MICHIGAN WATERFRONT - MOS - THE PAST

The MUSIC becomes SOUNDTRACK to the following scenes. Rob and SARAH, a thin, modestly attractive young woman, SARAH, walk and talk. They seem to be emphatically complaining together.

ROB (V.O.)

Charlie and I didn't match.	Marco
and Charlie matched.	Me and Sarah,
number four on the all time break-

ups list, matched.	She wore more or
less the same clothes as mine, had
an acceptable working knowledge of
music, and she had been dumped by
some asshole named Michael.	He was

her moment, Charlie was mine.	Sarah
had sworn off men.	I had sworn off
women.	It made sense to pool our
loathing of the opposite sex, swear
them off together, and get to share

a bed with someone at the same time.

INT. SARAH'S APARTMENT - MOS - NIGHT

Rob and SARAH sit up in bed, staring at the television...

ROB (V.O.)

We were frightened of being left
alone for the rest of our lives.
Only people of a certain disposition

are frightened of being alone for
the rest of their lives at twenty-
six.	We were of that disposition.
Everything seemed much later than it
was.

INT. SARAH'S KITCHEN - MOS - DAY ROB'S POV

of Sarah, sitting across the table, mid-confession.

ROB (V.O.)
When she told me that she met someone
else it made no sense.	Her meeting
someone else was contrary to the
whole spirit of our arrangement.

All we really had in common was that
we were dumped by people, and that
we were against dumping.	We were
 
violently anti-dump.	So how come I
got dumped?

ROB IN HIS CHAIR

The MUSIC becomes PRESENCE again, and Rob takes the needle off the record.

ROB

You run the risk of losing anyone
who is worth spending time with.
But I didn't know that at the time.

All I saw was that I'd moved down a
division and that it still hadn't
worked out, and this seemed cause
for a great deal of misery and self-
pity.	And that's when Laura came

along.

INT. ROB'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Rob is surrounded by stacks of records on the floor. He looks to camera.

ROB
I'm reorganizing my records tonight.
It's something I do in times of

emotional distress.	When Laura was
here I had them in alphabetical order,
before that, chronologically.
Tonight, though, I'm trying to put
them in the order in which I bought

them.	That way I can write my own
autobiography without picking up a

pen.	Pull them all off the shelves,
look for Revolver and go from there.
I'll be able to see how I got from

Deep Purple to The Soft Boys in twenty-
five moves.	What I really like about
my new system is that it makes me
more complicated than I am.	To find
anything you have to be me, or at

the very least a doctor in Rob-ology.
If you wanna find Landslide by
Fleetwood Mac you have to know that
I bought it for someone in the fall
of 1983 and then didn't give it to

them for personal reasons.	But you
don't know any of that, do you?	You

would have to ask me to--

The phone rings again.	Rob picks it up.

ROB

Yeah?

MOM

Hi, Rob.	It's your mother.

Rob deflates a bit.
 
ROB

Hi, Mom.

MOM
Everything all right?

ROB
Great.	Super-fantastic.

MOM
How's the store?

ROB

So so.	Up and down.

MOM

Your lucky Laura's doing so well.
If it wasn't for her, I don't think

either of us would ever sleep...

Rob holds his lips together with thumb and forefinger, but succumbs --

ROB
She left.	She's gone.

MOM
What do you mean?	Where did she go?

ROB
How would I know?	Gone.	Girlfriend.
Leave.	Not say where gone.	Laura
move out.

MOM
Well call her mother.

ROB

She just called.	She doesn't even
know.	It's probably the last time
I'll ever hear her voice.	That's

weird, isn't it?	You spend Christmas
at somebody's house, you know, and
you worry about their operations and
you see them in their bathrobe, and...
I dunno...

Silence.

ROB
There'll be another mom and another
Christmas.	Right?

Silence... More silence.

ROB

Hello?	Anybody there?

THE SOUND OF SOFT CRYING
 
ROB

I'm all right, if that's what's
upsetting you.

MOM
You know that's not what's upsetting
me.

ROB
Well it fucking should be, shouldn't
it?

MOM

I knew this would happen.	What are
you going to do Rob?

ROB
I'm going to drink this bottle of

wine watch TV and go to bed.	Then
tomorrow I'll get up and go to work.

MOM

And after that?

ROB
Meet a nice girl and have children.
I promise the next time we talk I'll
have it all sorted out.

MOM
I knew this was going to happen.

ROB

Then what are you getting so upset
about?

MOM
What did Laura say?	Do you know why
she left?

ROB

It's got nothing to do with marriage,
if that's what you're getting at.

MOM
So you say.	I'd like to hear her
side of it.

ROB
Mom!	For the last fucking time, I'm
telling you Laura didn't want to get

married!	She is not that kind of
girl!	To use a phrase.	That's not
what happens now.

MOM

Well I don't know what happens now,
apart from you meet someone, you
move in, she goes.	You meet someone,
 
you move in, she goes.

Silence.	Rob busted.

ROB
Shut up, Mom.

Rob hangs up the phone. He fills up his glass again, takes a swig, and slumps into a chair. If there was any wind left in Rob, it just got knocked out. After a moment, he gets to his feet, grabs his jacket and heads out the door.

CUT TO:

EXT. LOUNGE AX CLUB - LINCOLN AVE. - NIGHT

Rob comes down the street and gets in the short line to enter the club. From inside he hears a GUITAR, playing a tune that becomes familiar not only to Rob, but to us. When a strong, lilting female VOICE begins to sing, we hear what it is: "Baby I Love Your Way," by Peter Frampton.

Rob smiles at first, but begins to darken as the verse continues. He steps out of line and leans against the outside wall, listening. Is he beginning to cry? Yes, he is...

CUT TO:

ROB IN HIS CHAIR

ROB
Peter.	Frampton.	That perm! "Show
Me the Way"!	A phenomenon based on
a live album that was actually

recorded in a studio!	What is
happening?	I am getting misty, choked
up at a song that I had the good

sense at twelve to realize was so
saccharine and stupid as to be
inarticulatable, until Michael Bolton,
that is.

CUT BACK TO:

EXT. LOUNGE AX CLUB - LINCOLN AVE.

He looks around self-consciously, and paces a bit, deciding whether or not to stay. He takes a deep breath, and heads in the door.

INT. LOUNGE AX - NIGHT

As Rob enters he looks to the stage, where MARIE LASALLE is standing alone with her acoustic guitar, heading toward the song's finish. Rob's expression begins to shift from the melancholy to something else altogether. Marie is beautiful, and Marie has touched his heart. Rob navigates toward her though the small crowd as if pulled by something unseen. He addresses us over his shoulder.
 
ROB
Sentimental music makes you nostalgic

and hopeful at the same time.	Marie's
the hopeful part.	Laura's the
nostalgia part.	These things happen.
They happen to men, at any rate.
This is why I shouldn't be listening

to pop music.

As he gets closer to the stage --

DICK

ROB!

Rob looks over to see Dick sitting with Barry, a few feet away. He shakes it off and sits with them, extending a meaningful hand to Barry, who takes it. They turn back to the stage as Marie finishes the song.

ROB
I always hated this song.

DICK
Yeah.

BARRY
Yeah.

ROB

But now I kind of like it.

Dick and Barry nod, then keep watching. All three of them are in their own private fantasies with Marie.

DICK
She shouldn't done it on "The Number
Four With a Smile."

BARRY

Isn't her album called "Number Four
With A Smile?"

DICK
That's what I said.

BARRY
No, no, no, you said "The Number
Four With a Smile," and there's no
"The" at the front of the title of

the album.

DICK

It's a reference to a Chinese meal
in Toronto and I think that there is
a "The."	But I could be wrong.

BARRY

You can be and are wrong.

They drop it, so that their eyes can drift back to Marie.
 
BARRY

I wanna date a musician...

ROB
(nods in agreement)
I wanna live with a musician.	She'd

write songs at home, ask me what she
thought of them, maybe even include
one of our private jokes in the liner
notes.

BARRY
...Maybe a picture of me in the liner
notes...

DICK

Just in the background somewhere.

MARIE

as the song ends, and she smiles out over the room. The audience applauds.

MARIE
Thanks, you guys, I know I'm not
supposed to like that song, but I

do.	I'm gonna take a break for a
second.	Anybody wants to buy one of
my tapes, they're five bucks up here.
One of my other personalities will
be selling them.

ROB, DICK, AND BARRY

BARRY
Let's go get one.

ROB

Let's not.

DICK

I want a tape.

Barry and Dick stand and begin to move off...

ROB

I don't need to go up there right
now.

...and they're gone. After a beat, Rob gets up and follows them.

FOOT OF THE STAGE

Dick and Barry wait nervously to buy a tape, Rob just behind them. Marie processes sales with polite monosyllables, until the three get up front.

MARIE
 
Enjoying yourselves?

They dart eyes to each other, then nod.

MARIE
Good.	'Cause I'm enjoying myself.

ROB
Good.

Rob hands her a ten and she roots around in a duffel bag for change...

ROB

So you live in Chicago now?

MARIE

Yup.	Not far from here, actually.

BARRY
You like it?

MARIE
It's okay.	Hey.	You guys might be
the sort to know.	Are there any
good record stores around here or do
I have to go downtown?

Barry and Dick do not try to control themselves. They point to Rob.

DICK

He's got one!

BARRY
On Clark Street!

DICK
A couple blocks!	About six!

BARRY
We work there!

DICK

You'd love it!
