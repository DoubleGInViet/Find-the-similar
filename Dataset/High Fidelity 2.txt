Marie laughs.

MARIE

What do you sell?

BARRY

A little of anything that matters.
Rock, soul, R&B, punk rock, hip-
hop, ska, new wave...

MARIE

Sounds great.

The line behind them is moving in, and Marie smiles at them
 
and turns to someone else. They scurry back toward their table.

ROB

What did you tell her about the shop
for?

BARRY
I didn't know it was classified
information.	I mean, I know we don't
have any customers, but I thought
that was a bad thing, not, like, a

business strategy.

Rob looks over Barry at Marie. She catches his eye as she looks over the room. His eyes shoot to the floor.

CUT TO:

INT. RECORD STORE - STOCK ROOM - LATER

Rob is going through a huge stack of used CD's, sorting them off into different bins, bouncing his head absently to the music -- the same song of Marie's that Rob had on when Laura called last night.

BARRY (O.S.)

ROB!	PHONE!

Rob reaches over and hits the SPEAKER button on the phone, still in the groove of sorting.

ROB
Rob here.

LIZ (O.S.)
Hey.	It's Liz.

ROB

What's happenin'.

LIZ

You called this morning?

ROB
Yeah.	I just wanted to thank you
for that message last night.	It

made me feel like... like less of an
asshole.

LIZ
How're you holding up?

ROB

Actually, I'm fine.	I'm great.
Last night I got to thinking, "you
know what?	Maybe it is time to move

on.	Maybe we're just not right for
each other.	Or maybe we are.	But
time will tell and at this point I'm
 
going to be fine with whatever's
meant to be." You know?

LIZ

Yeah.	Like I said, I don't want to
take sides.	And I like Laura with
you.	She's more fun, more open.

You guys are good together.	I just
wish you two could, I don't know.	I
don't think much of this Ian guy --

-- Dick bursts in, huge-faced --

DICK

Rob.

ROB

Liz, hold on a second --
(turns to Dick)

What?

DICK

Marie LaSalle is in the store!	Here,
she's here, and now!

Rob freezes, he and Dick turn to the speaker, which cranks Marie's voice. Rob goes to the phone and picks up the handset.

ROB
Liz, can you hold for a second?

He hits hold.

ROB
(to Dick)
I'll be out there!	Go!

(picks up the phone)
Hey, Liz, I gotta go... Tomorrow
night?	Great.	Green Mill.	Fine.
Seven?	Done.	Thanks.	Right.	Bye.

He hangs up fast, spins around to look in a cracked one-foot-square cracked mirror bearing the logo of Aerosmith that is mounted on the wall, and moves out into the

FRONT ROOM

and up the aisle fast toward the stereo where he turns Marie's music off. He takes a deep breath and looks up, meeting her eyes.

ROB
Oh.	Hi.

Marie smiles.

MARIE
(re: music)
Don't you like that?
 
ROB

No, no, I love, it's just, thinking
you're, you must be so sick of it...
Well.

He reaches back and puts it back on. He cracks his face into a smile, then walks fast back to the stock room door. Marie watches him go.

STOCK ROOM

where as soon as he crosses the threshold his fist clench and he grimaces:

ROB
WHAT FUCKING IAN GUY?!!

Dick comes in --

DICK
Rob --!

ROB

-- FUCK OFF!

Dick backs out fast.	Rob leans on a wall.	Barry enters --

BARRY

We're only on the fucking list for
Marie's gig at the Pulaski Pub, that's
all!	All three of us.

ROB

That's fucking great, Barry.	We can
spend fifteen bucks on a cab to save
five each.	Fantastic, Barry!

BARRY

We can take your car.

ROB

It's not my car, now is it?	It's
Laura's car, and thus Laura has it.
So it's an ass-bumping double-
transferring bus ride through
bumblefuck or a fat wad on a cab.

Wow.	Fucking great.

Barry sighs, throws up his hands and heads out the door.

BARRY

Jaggoff...

Barry exits. Rob seems to be having trouble staying on his feet.

ROB
Who the fuck is Ian?!
 
CUT TO:

INT. ROB'S BUILDING'S LOBBY - NIGHT

Rob enters and walks to the mail table, looking like shit.

He starts sifting through envelopes for his.

ROB

Laura doesn't know anybody called
Ian.	There's no Ian at her office.
She has no friends named Ian.	She

has never met anyone called Ian in
her whole life.	Although there may
have been one in college -- but I am
almost certain that since 1989 she
has lived in an Ian-less universe.

He slows... and stops. His face gets a little paler as he lifts a letter up to his face.

CLOSE-UP: LETTER

A cable service bill to a Mr. I. Raymond.

ROB

as he looks at it, divining.

ROB
"I. Raymond." Ray. "I." IAN.

CUT TO:

ROB IN HIS CHAIR

Rob to camera.

ROB

Mr. I Raymond. "Ray" to his friends,
and, more importantly, to his
neighbors.	The guy who up until

about six weeks ago lived upstairs.
I knew it was him the moment I saw
the letter.	I start to remember
things now: His stupid clothing, his
music -- Latin, Bulgarian, whatever

fucking world music was trendy that
week--stupid laugh, awful cooking

smells.	I can't remember anything
good about him at all.	I never liked
him much then, and I fucking hate

him now... I manage to block out the
worst, most painful, most disturbing
memory of him until I go to bed.

INT. ROB'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Darkness. We move silently through the rooms, and enter the bedroom... closer to the bed, we see Rob on his back, sheets
 
held clenched up to his chin. He stares at the ceiling, sadly.

JUMP CUT

To almost the same shot, but it's Rob and Laura in the bed, semi-tangled. Laura has a book in her lap. A CREAKING is heard. Laura's eyes go to the ceiling, and Rob sits up at attention. They look up at the light fixture, which shakes a little faster, with the rhythm of the creaking. Someone is definitely having sex upstairs, and they are going for it.

ROB

Jeez.	He goes on long enough.

LAURA

I should be so lucky.

They turn to each other and laugh.

JUMP CUT BACK

to Rob lying still in bed, staring at the ceiling.

ROB
You are as abandoned and as noisy as
any character in a porn film, Laura.
You are Ian's plaything, responding
to his touch with shrieks of orgasmic
delight.	No woman in the history of
the world is having better sex than

the sex you are having with Ian in
my head.

ROB'S IAN-LAURA SEX NIGHTMARE - QUICK CUTS

Ian mercilessly savages Laura from behind, below, and above, champagne showers, toe-sucking, and animal screams --

BACK TO ROB IN BED,

imploding with disgust and sorrow. Tears run down his cheeks into his ears.

ROB
Number five -- Jackie Allen.	My
break up with Jackie Allen had no
effect on my life whatsoever.	I

just slotted her in to bump you out
of position, Laura.	Yes, you do in
fact make it into the top five.

Welcome.	And just to remind you,
the list is in chronological order,
not in the order of pain and
suffering.

INT. RECORD STORE - DAY

Dick and Barry are stocking the racks.	Rob stands at the
 
register, rocking back and forth sort of like an idiot, to "Always and Forever" by the Commodores. He is a mess.

FEMALE VOICE

Hey.

Rob looks up to see a nineteen or twenty-year-old GIRL standing in front of him.

GIRL
Do you have soul?

Rob smiles bitterly at her, clearly having a different meaning in mind.

ROB
That all depends.

She kind of backs away and goes back to browsing. The phone rings and Rob picks it up.

ROB

Record Exchange... How many records...
Right, well if you could bring them --
okay, well, where do you live?
Right... how about now?	I can come
right over...

(Rob scribbles)
Okay.

He hangs up and grabs his jacket. Dick emerges from the back.

ROB

(to Dick)
Some lady's got some singles to sell.
I'll be back in a half-hour.

Rob walks out.

EXT./INT. FANCY LINCOLN PARK TOWNHOUSE - DAY

Rob mounts the stairs and rings the doorbell. The door opens, revealing a too-tan WOMAN in her late forties, in designer jeans and a T-shirt bearing a rhinestone peace sign.

She says nothing.

ROB

Hi.	You called about the records?

She turns and walks into the house, leaving the door open for him. He follows her in and through a fabulous first floor, packed with big-bucks bourgeois: Rugs, art, and antiques:

She ushers Rob into a large study, and turns the light on. He misses a breath. The walls are lined with mahogany cases custom-built for CDs, albums, epicurean stereo components, a couple priceless vintage guitars -- every one of the thousands
 
of items bear a little numbered sticker, like a museum. She points to several boxes on the floor, full of hundreds of singles.

WOMAN
Those.

Rob steps into the room like an Undeserving, and carefully drops to his knees to examine the singles, each pristine in a plastic sleeve: the original God Save the Queen by the Sex Pistols, original Otis Reddings, Elvis Presleys, James Browns, Jerry Lee Lewises, Beatles... on and on. The mother lode.

Rob is doing the best to control the onset of hyperventilation. He dares a glance over his shoulder to her to see if this is a joke.

WOMAN

What do you think?

ROB
It's the best collection I've ever
seen.

WOMAN

Give me fifty bucks and they're all
yours.

Rob's face goes funny.	He looks around for a hidden camera.

ROB
These are worth at least, I don't
know --

WOMAN

I know what they're worth.	Give me
fifty and get them out.

ROB
But you must have --

WOMAN
I must have nothing.	Their my
husband's.

ROB
And you must not be getting along
too well right now, huh?

WOMAN

He's in Jamaica with a twenty-three-
year-old.	A friend of my daughter's.
He had the fucking nerve to call me

and ask me to borrow some money and
I told him to fuck off, so he asked
me to sell his singles collection
and send him a check for whatever I
go, minus a ten percent commission.

Which reminds me.	Can you make sure
you give me a five?	I want to frame
it and put it on the wall.
 
ROB

It must have taken him a long time
to get them together.

WOMAN
Years.	This collection is as close
as he's ever come to an achievement.

Rob looks back at the records but avoids the trance.

ROB

Look.	Can I pay you properly?	You
don't have to tell him what you got.
Send him forty-five bucks and blow
the rest.	Give it to charity.	Or
something.

WOMAN

That wasn't part of the deal.	I
want to be poisonous but fair.

ROB
(looking back at the
records)
Look... I... I'm sorry.	I don't
want to be any part of this.

WOMAN

Suit yourself.	There are plenty of
others who will.

ROB
That's why I'm trying to compromise.

What about fifteen-hundred?	They're
worth five times that.

WOMAN
Sixty.

ROB
Thirteen hundred.

WOMAN

Seventy-five.

ROB

Eleven-hundred.	That's my lowest
offer.

WOMAN
And I won't take a penny over ninety.

They start smiling at each other.

WOMAN
With eleven hundred he could come

home, and that's the last thing I
want.
 
ROB
I'm sorry but I think you better

talk to someone else.

WOMAN
Fine.

Rob half stands, then drops again for one last lingering look.

ROB
Can I buy this Otis Redding single
off you?

WOMAN
Sure.	Ten cents.

ROB
Oh, come on!	Let me give you ten

dollars for this, and you can give
the rest away for all I care.

WOMAN
Okay.	Because you took the trouble
to come up here.	And because you've
got principles.	But that's it.	I'm
not selling them to you one by one.

CUT TO:

EXT. FANCY LINCOLN PARK TOWNHOUSE - DAY

Rob comes down the stairs holding his single, and walks down the street talking to camera.

ROB
How come I end up siding with the
bad guy, the man who ran off to
Jamaica with some nymphette?	I just
got left for someone else, so why
can't I bring myself to feel whatever
it is his wife is feeling?	All I

can see is that guy's face when he
gets that pathetic check in the mail
for those records, and I can't help
but feel desperately, painfully sorry
for him.

CUT TO:

INT. GREEN MILL - NIGHT

The bar where Al Capone used to party, and it looks about the same: colored lightbulbs, shadowboxes, deep plush booths and a stage for jazz. Rob slumps back in a booth, stirring a drink with his finger. After a beat, we hear a DOOR SLAM off camera, and Rob looks up with a bit of fear.

Heavy footsteps get louder and closer, until a shadow shrouds Rob -- LIZ stands in front of him.
 
LIZ

MOTHERFUCKER.

She is enormous, and she is mad as hell. Rob reflexively shrinks.

ROB
What's the -- hey, Liz --

LIZ

--	No, no, no, don't even. I talked to Laura, Rob. I talked to her and she gave me a little background.

And you're a fucking ASSHOLE.

She turns and stomps toward the door. Rob gets up and follows.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Rob comes out of the club and follows Liz. She hears him and turns on him, punctuating with a finger in his chest.

LIZ
To think I sympathized with you for
two seconds!	Poor Rob!	Laura left

him out of nowhere for the schmuck
upstairs.	You let me believe that!

ROB
It's true!

LIZ

Rob!	Two years ago you got Laura
pregnant; you then proceeded to cheat
on her!	You borrowed money from her

and never paid a dime back!	And
then, just a few weeks ago, you told
her you were unhappy with her and
were "kind of looking around for
somebody else!"

ROB

Well she --

She turns again and keeps walking, holding a defiant middle finger over her shoulder as she fades down the street.

INT. SUBWAY CAR - NIGHT

Rob sits, rocking slightly with the movement of the train.

He stares at an OLD COUPLE who do not speak to each other.

ROB
She's right, of course.	I am a

fucking asshole.	I did and said
those things.	But before you judge,
although you've probably already
 
done so, go off for a minute and
write down the top five worst things

that you have done to your partner,
even if -- especially if -- your
partner doesn't know about them.
Don't dress things up or try to
explain them.	Just write them down

in the plainest language possible...

A LONG BEAT, even five or ten seconds.

ROB

Pencils down.	Okay, so who's the
asshole now?

CUT TO:

INT. RECORD STORE - DAY

Saturday. For the first time we see the place kind of busy. Rob watches the room. Barry is toward the back, talking to a CUSTOMER. "Cruel to Be Kind" by Nick Lowe plays.

BARRY

It's almost impossible to find,
especially on CD.	Yet another cruel
trick on all of the dumbasses who

got rid of their turntables.	But
every other Echo and the Bunnymen
album --

CUSTOMER

I have all of the others.

BARRY
Oh really.	Well what about the first
Jesus and Mary Chain?

CUSTOMER

They always seemed...

BARRY

They always seemed what?	They always
seemed really great, is what they
always seemed.	They picked up where
your precious Echo left off, and
you're sitting here complaining about

no more Echo albums.	I can't believe
that you don't own that record.

That's insane.

He plucks it from the rack, and sticks it in the Customer's hand, who regards it with a bit a of shame.

CUSTOMER
Well what about the new Echo --

BARRY
Do not get ahead of yourself.
 
DICK

is listening to a female customer, but he doesn't hear her voice.

CUSTOMER - DICK'S POV

The army bag with a red cross on it. The ring-of-ivy tattoo around the wrist. The monkey boots. The eye shadow.

DICK

thinking, calculating...

DICK
The interesting thing about Green
Day is that so much of their music

is in truth directly influenced by,
in my opinion, two bands.

FEMALE CUSTOMER
The Clash.

DICK

Correct.	The Clash.	But also the
Stranglers.

FEMALE CUSTOMER
Who?

DICK
I think you would love the
Stranglers...

Dick pulls a Stranglers record and puts it on the stereo.
Her brow furrows, and then she smiles.

FEMALE CUSTOMER
This sounds great.

Dick smiles humbly. Two people in the store turn and approach.

CUSTOMER

Is this the new Green Day?

BARRY still talking to his Customer, who now has several CD's in his hand. He looks at Barry with a mixture of hate and adoration.

BARRY
That is perverse.	Do not tell anyone
you don't own fucking Blonde on
Blonde.	What about Television?

CUSTOMER
I have a television.

BARRY

NO--!
 
Barry adds more records to the Customer's stack.

A FEW MINUTES LATER - ROB AND DICK

stand behind the counter. Rob holds a CD in his hand, and surveys the roaming customers with a semi-serious air of authority.

ROB
I will now sell four copies of Cats
and Dogs by the Royal Trux.

DICK

Do it.	Do it.

Rob pops the CD in and it begins to play... He stands there with his arms folded, waiting. After a moment, a Customer approaches.

CUSTOMER
(re: music)
What is this?

ROB
It's the Royal Trux.

CUSTOMER
It's great.

ROB
I know.

ROB'S POV

of the room. Something has caught his eye: a cropped head with a leopard skin pattern surfaces and disappears, like Nessie.

Rob's face gets hot and mad. He jumps out from behind the counter.

ROB
Dick, ring the man up...

He moves like a cat through the crowd. Justin sees him coming and counters around the middle island and heads for the door. Vince appears next to him, fiddling with his belt.

He sees Rob now, and he and Justin bolt for the door. Rob doubles back.

ROB
DICK!	THE DOOR!

Dick sees Vince and Justin too late. Rob is right behind them and as they get out the door, he reaches... and comes up with the back half of a skateboard.

EXT. RECORD STORE - DAY
 
Rob emerges behind them, Vince's skateboard in hand. They have enough distance to bolt, but they can't leave that board behind.

ROB
Okay, fuckos.	How much is this deck
worth to you, and how many CD's did
you rip off?	Can you do the math?

Justin pulls two CD's out and slides them over to Rob.

ROB
(to Vince)
And what about you, dork?

Vince pulls about six, and puts them down in a neutral spot.

Rob picks all of them up and starts looking through them.

Dicks pokes his head out of the door.

ROB
Dick, call the police, please.

Vince and Justin look at each other.

ROB
(looking through the
CD's)
Eno import.	Sigue Sigue Sputnik.
Break beats.	Serge Gainsbourg.

Ryuchi Sakamoto, Syd Barrett...
What's going on here?	Are you guys

stealing for other people now?

VINCE

Naw.	Those are for us.

ROB
Oh really.	You two are slamming to
Nico now?

JUSTIN

You're, like, so bigoted to look at
us and, like, think you know what we
listen to.

VINCE

You got the CD's so can I have my
board back?

ROB
I think you have more.

VINCE
Well we don't.

ROB

I can't frisk you but the cops can.
 
Justin reaches down again into his baggy shorts and comes up with a tattered old book, "How To Make A Record." He tosses it over.

ROB
Jesus.	That thing's been in the
bargain bin for six months!	Was it
just your criminal nature or what?
Hell, I would've given it to you for
free.

VINCE
No, we...

JUSTIN
We don't know how it works.	Nobody
even knows, so we wanted to check it
out in that mag.

Rob snorts.

JUSTIN
Like, do you know how to actually
make a CD?

Rob can't resist edifying them -- the curse of the underappreciated expert.

ROB
Uh, yes I, like, do... It's simple.
You make the tracks -- recording

studio -- deliver them to the pressing
plant where a master is cut, the

master is then dubbed to submasters,
which are the "mothers," as their
called, for each press in the plant.

You press the CD's or records, put
in your cover art, and that's it.

VINCE
Records are those big round black
things, right?

ROB
Fuck off.

Rob turns to go back in the store.

VINCE
Hey, can I have my board?

Rob drops it and enters the store.

CUT TO:

INT. RECORD STORE - NIGHT - QUICK CUTS:

Barry emerges from the back with three opened bottles of beer as the last customer goes out the door... The three
 
lean against the bins, tired and smiling.

BARRY
(to Rob)
What?

ROB

What do you mean, "what?"

BARRY
What are you snickering about?

ROB
I'm not snickering.	I'm smiling.
Because I'm happy.

BARRY

What am I missing?	What do you have
to be happy about?

DICK
Well we rang $900 today.

ROB

Yeah but more than that.	I'm happy
because I'm proud of us.	Because
although our talents are small and

peculiar, we use them to their best
advantage.

Dick and Barry look at each other. They almost know how to take a compliment.

EXT. RECORD STORE - NIGHT

Rob, now alone, turns the sign from "open" to "closed" shuts the door behind him, and pulls the gate across. Laura appears from the next doorway. He jumps.

ROB
Shit!

LAURA
Hi.

ROB
Hi.

LAURA

I thought I could give you a lift
back.

ROB
Are you coming home?

LAURA
Yes.	Well, I'm coming over to your

house to get some things.

ROB
 
My house?

Laura turns and begins walking.	Rob looks at camera.

ROB
First of all: The money.	The money
is easy to explain: She had it and I

didn't, and she wanted to give it to
me.	If she hadn't, I would have
gone under.	I've never paid her
back because I've never been able
to, and just because she's took off

and moved in with some Supertramp
fan doesn't make me five grand richer.
So that's the money --

Laura's CAR HORN is heard.	He heads off.

CUT TO:

INT. LAURA'S CAR - NIGHT

They move down the street, and it's a little tense. Laura pushes a tape into the stereo. Art Garfunkel's "Bright Eyes" begins to play. Rob turns away from her and makes a face, but she knows he's making it.

LAURA
You can make all the faces you want.
My car.	My car stereo.	My
compilation tape.

Rob tries not to speak, but --

ROB
How can you like Art Garfunkel and
Marvin Gaye?	It's like saying you

support the Israelis and the
Palestinians.

LAURA
It's not like saying that at all,
actually, Rob.	Art Garfunkel and
Marvin Gaye make pop records --

ROB

--	Made. Made. Marvin Gaye is dead, his father shot him in --

LAURA
-- whatever, and the Israelis and
the Palestinians don't.	Art Garfunkel

and Marvin Gaye are not engaged in a
bitter territorial dispute, and the
Israelis and the Palestinians are.
Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye --

ROB
-- Alright, alright but --
 
LAURA

--	and who says I like Marvin Gaye, anyway?

He reels on her.

ROB

Hey!	Marvin Gaye! "Got to Give It
Up!" That's our song!	Marvin Gaye
is responsible for our entire
relationship!

LAURA
Is that right?	I'd like a word with
him.

ROB

But don't you remember?

LAURA
I remember the song.	I just couldn't
remember who sang it.

Rob shakes his head in disbelief.

LAURA
I can see why you prefer Gaye to
Garfunkel.	I get it, really.	But
there are so many other things to
worry about.	They're only records,
and if one is better than the other,
well, who cares, besides you and

Barry and Dick?	I mean really, who
gives a flying fuck?

Silence.

ROB
You used to care more about things
like Marvin Gaye than you do now.
When I first met you, and I made you
that tape, you loved it.	You said --

and I quote -- "It was so good it
made you ashamed of your record
collection."

LAURA

Well, I liked you.	You were a deejay,
and I thought you were hot, and I

didn't have a boyfriend, and I wanted
one.

ROB
So you weren't interested in music
at all?

LAURA

Yeah, sure.	More so then than I am
now.	That's life though, isn't it?
 
The car slows, and Laura parks.

ROB
But Laura... that's me.	That's all
there is to me.	There isn't anything
else.	If you've lost interest in
that, you've lost interest in

everything.

LAURA
You really believe that?

Laura turns the engine off and unbuckles her seat belt.

ROB
Yes.	Look at me.	Look at our --
the apartment.	What else do I have,

other than records and CDs?

LAURA
And do you like it that way?

ROB
Not really.

She half smiles.

LAURA
Let's go in.

She gets out of the car. Rob turns to camera, speaking quietly and urgently.

ROB

Okay, Number two: The stuff I told
her about being unhappy in the
relationship, about half looking

around for someone else: She tricked
me into saying it.	We were having
this state of the union type
conversation and she said, quite
matter-of-factly, that we were pretty

unhappy at the moment, and did I
agree, and I said yes, and she asked
whether I ever thought about meeting
someone else.	So I asked her if she
ever thought about it, and she said

of course, so I admitted that I
daydream about it from time to time.

Now I see that what we were really
talking about was her and Ian, and
she suckered me into absolving her.

It was a sneaky lawyer's trick, and
I fell for it, because she's much
smarter than me.

He scrambles out of the car.

INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT
 
The lock turns and Rob enters, holding the door for Laura who slips by, her coat in her hands. She glances down at the table by the door and sees Ian's envelope.

ROB
You can take it with you if you want.

She slips it into her purse. He stands facing her for a moment, then crosses to her, takes her coat and tosses it on a chair. She opens the closet and takes out a big laundry sack.

LAURA
Have you tackled the Great
Reorganization yet?

ROB

Don't you think there are more
important things to talk about than

my record collection?

She begins putting books and other things into the bag...

LAURA

You bet.	I've been saying that for
years.

Having no comeback, Rob goes for the moral high ground.

ROB
So.	Where have you been staying for
the last week?

LAURA

I think you know that.

ROB

Had to work it out for myself, though,
didn't I?

Laura looks suddenly tired and sad, and looks away.

LAURA
I'm sorry.	I haven't been very fair
to you.	That's why I came here to
the store this evening.	I feel
terrible, Rob.	This is really hard,

you know.

ROB
Good.
(beat)

So.	Is it my job?

LAURA
What?	Gimme a fucking break.	Is
that what you think?	That your not

big enough a deal for me?	Jesus,
gimme a little credit, Rob.
 
ROB
I don't know.	It's one of the things

I thought of.

LAURA
What were the others?

ROB
Just the obvious stuff.

LAURA
What's the obvious stuff?

ROB

I don't know.

She stands and walks toward the bathroom.

LAURA

I guess it's not that obvious, then.

ROB

No.

As soon as she shuts the door behind her, he turns to camera.

ROB

And number three: The Pregnancy.	I
didn't know she was pregnant.	Of
course I didn't.	She hadn't told me
because I had told her I was... sort
of... seeing somebody else.	We

thought we were being very grown-up,
but we were being preposterously

naive, childish even, to think that
one of us could fuck around and then
own up to it while we were living

together.	So -- I didn't find out
about it 'til way later.	We were
going through a good period and I
made a crack about having kids and
she burst into tears.	I made her

tell me what it was all about, and
she did.	I felt guilty and so I got
angry.	She told me that at the time
I didn't look like a very good long-
term bet.	That it was a hard decision

and she didn't see any point in
consulting me about it...	When the

whole sorry tale comes out in a great
big --

We hear the bathroom door open.

LAURA (O.S.)
What?

ROB
(covering)
What, what?
 
Laura comes out with a toiletry bag and places it by the door.

LAURA
Did you say something?

ROB
No.	So.	Is it working out with
Ian?

LAURA

Rob.	Don't be childish.

ROB
Why is that childish?	Your living
with the guy!	I'm just asking how

it's going.

LAURA
I am not living with him.	I've just
been staying with him for a few days

until I work out what I'm doing.
Look, this has nothing to do with
anyone else.	You know that, don't
you?	I left because we weren't
exactly getting along, and we weren't

talking about it.	And I suddenly
realized that I like my job, and I
like what my life is could be turning
into, and that I'm getting to a point
where I want to get my shit together

and I can't really see that ever
happening with you, and yeah, yeah,

I sort of get interested in someone
else, and that went further than it
should have, so it seemed like a

good time to go.	But I have no idea
what will happen with Ian in the
long run.	Probably nothing.

ROB

Well then why don't you quit it while
you seem to not be ahead?

Laura rolls her eyes and head off into the bedroom with the laundry bag. Rob turns back to camera.

ROB

--	When the whole sorry tale comes out in a great big lump like that, even the most shortsighted jerk, even the most self-deluding and self pitying of jilted, wounded lovers can see that there is some cause and effect going on here, that abortions and Ian and money and affairs all belong to, all deserve each other.

Laura reappears, her bag half-filled with clothes, and goes
 
to the book shelves next to the records. She starts topping off the bag with books.

LAURA

Look.	Maybe you'll grow up and we'll
get it together, you and me.	Maybe
I'll never see either of you again.

I don't know.	All I know is that
it's not a good time to be living
here.

ROB

So, what, you haven't definitely
decide to dump me?	There's still a
chance we'll get back together?

LAURA

I don't know.

ROB
Well, if you don't know, there's a
chance, right?	It's like, if someone

was in the hospital and he was
seriously ill and the doctor said, I
don't know if he's got a chance of
survival or not, then that doesn't
mean the patient's definitely going

to die, now does it?	It means he
might live.	Even if it's only a
remote possibility.

LAURA

I suppose so.

ROB
So we have a chance of getting back
together again.

LAURA

Oh, Rob, shut up.

ROB

Hey, I just want to know where I
stand.	What chance --

LAURA

--	I don't fucking know what chance you fucking have!

She abandons her attempt at packing.

ROB

Well if you could tell me roughly it
would help.

LAURA
Okay, okay, we have a nine percent

chance of getting back together.
Does that clarify the situation?
 
ROB
Yeah.	Great.

LAURA

(shaking her head)
I'm too tired for this now.	I know
I'm asking a lot, but will you take

off for a while so I can get my stuff
packed up?	I need to be able to

think while I do it and I can't think
while you're here.

ROB
No problem.	If I can ask one
question.

LAURA

Fine.	One.

ROB
It sounds stupid.

LAURA
Nevermind.

ROB
You won't like it.

LAURA

Just ask it!

ROB

Is it better?

LAURA
Is what better?	Better than what?

ROB
Well.	Sex, I guess.	Is sex with
him better?

LAURA

Jesus Christ, Rob.	Is that really
what's bothering you?

ROB
Of course it is.

LAURA

You really think it would make a
difference either way?

ROB
I don't know.

LAURA
Well the answer is that I don't know

either.	We haven't done it yet.

ROB
 
Never?

LAURA
I haven't felt like it.

ROB
But not even before, when he was
living upstairs?

LAURA
No.	I was living with you, remember?
We've slept together but we haven't

made love.	Not yet.	But I'll tell
you one thing.	The sleeping together
is better.

ROB

(trying not to smile)
The sleeping together is better but

not the sex because you haven't done
it was him yet.

LAURA
Will you please just go?

INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT

Rob shuts the door behind him and does a crazy Charleston/Cabbage-Patch/Boxstep/Touchdown dance of pure elation, then bounces down the stairs.

CUT TO:

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Rob bounces along, a smile wider than we have seen yet.

Maybe even jumping to touch an awning. He lands and tells us:

ROB
I feel good!	I feel great!	I feel
like a new man.	I feel so much
better, in fact --

INT. WEEDS BAR - NIGHT

Rob moves through the room, still grinning a bit like a proud new father, toward the table where Barry, Dick, Marie and T-Bone sit, listening to a story T-Bone is telling.

Marie turns to him.

ROB

Hi, Marie.

MARIE

Everything go alright?

Rob glances at Barry, who averts his gaze.
 
ROB

She just wanted to pick up some stuff.
No big thing.	A relief, actually.

MARIE
God, I hate that time.	That pick up
stuff time.	I just went through
that before I came here.	You know
that song "Patsy Cline Times Two" I
play?	That's about me and my ex
dividing up our record collections.

ROB

It's a great song.

MARIE

Thank you.

Rob glances at T-Bone, his mind calculating the new info.

ROB

Is that why you came to Chicago in
the first place?	Because of, you
know, dividing up your record
collection and stuff?

MARIE
Yup.

Marie slides closer, turning her back on the others. The loop is closed.

ROB

You share a place with T-Bone?

MARIE

No way!	I'd cramp his style.	And I
wouldn't want to listen to all that
stuff happening on the other side of
the bedroom wall.	I'm way to
unattached for that.

ROB

I understand completely.

SERIES OF CUTS - ELAPSED TIME

Rob and Marie lean in to each other, everyone else out of focus.

ROB (V.O.)

Awhile back, Dick and Barry and I
agreed that what really matters is
what you like, not what you are
like...

ROB AND MARIE - LATER

MARIE
 
Yeah, but if you heard this band
called the Crumblers, you'd --

ROB

What do you mean, the Crumblers?
You know the Crumblers?	Nobody's
heard the Crumblers.	Except me.

MARIE

Yeah, I know the Crumblers!	I bought
a used Blasters album in New York
about ten years ago and somebody

left a Crumblers single in it.	My
everything changed for a couple of
weeks.

Rob glows --

ROB (V.O.)

Books, records, films -- these things
matter.	Call me shallow but it's
the damn truth, and by this measure

I was having one of the best dates
of my life.

ROB AND MARIE

ROB
Yeah, but you know what's his best
film and nobody's even seen it?

MARIE

The Conformist.

ROB
Exactly!	Fucking ex-actly!

MARIE
(laughs)
You haven't even seen it!

ROB

Nor have you!
