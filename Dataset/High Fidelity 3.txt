They just laugh and laugh --

ROB (V.O.)

References, titles, lyrics, flew and
met each other in mid-air embraces.

The evening goes with breathtaking
precision.

INT. MARIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Rob and Marie are kissing standing up.

MARIE

Are you okay?

ROB
 
(nodding)
Yes.	You?

MARIE

For now.	But I wouldn't be if I
thought this was the end of the
evening.

ROB

I'm sure it isn't.

MARIE

Good.	In that case, I'll fix us
something else to drink.	You sticking
to the whiskey or you want coffee?

ROB

Whiskey.

Marie goes into the kitchen, and they keep talking around the corner.

MARIE
Tops off two whiskeys and starts
into the other room where she sees
Rob, standing and holding his jacket.

ROB
I'd better go.	I gotta get up early.
Go over to my parents'.

MARIE

When I said before that I hoped it
wasn't the end of the evening, I

was, you know... talking about
breakfast and stuff.

She plants the whiskeys firmly on the coffee table.

MARIE
I'd like it if you could stay the
night.

ROB

(as if it is dawning
on him)
Oh, right.	Alright.

MARIE

Jesus, so much for delicacy.	I pegged
you for a master of understatement,
beating around the bush and all that

buzz.

ROB
I use it but I don't understand it
when other people use it.

MARIE

So you'll stay?
 
ROB

Yeah.

MARIE
Good.

Marie picks up the drinks again and exits to the bedroom.

Rob just stands there... and the LIGHTING CHANGES.

ROB

(to camera)
Over nine million men in this country
have slept with ten or more women.
And do they all look like Richard
Gere?	Are they all as rich as Bill

Gates?	Charming as Oscar Wilde?
Hell no.	Nothing to do with any of

that.	Maybe fifty or so have one or
more of these attributes, but that
still leaves... well, about nine

million, give or take fifty.	And
they're just men.	Regular guys.
We're just guys, because I, even I,
am a member of this exclusive, nine
million member club.	In fact, Marie

is my seventeenth lover. "How does
he do it?" you ask. "He wears bad
sweaters, he's grumpy, he's broke,
he hangs out with the Musical Moron
Twins, and he gets to go to bed with

a recording artist who looks like
Susan Dey-slash-Meg Ryan.	What's

going on?	Listen up, because I think
I can explain, with all modesty aside:
I ask questions.	That's it.	That's

my secret.	It works precisely because
that isn't how you're supposed to do
it, if you listen to the collective
male wisdom.	There are still enough
old-style, big-mouthed, egomaniacs

running around to make someone like
me appear to be refreshingly
different.	If you can't hack this
simple strategy, there are some women
out there, of course, who want to

get pushed around, ignored and mowed
over, but do you really want to be

with them anyway?

...he goes through a door into the bedroom. Marie is taking off her earrings.

ROB
Would you like me to turn the lights
out?	Or would you like them on?

MARIE

God, you ask a lot of questions.
 
INT. MARIE'S BEDROOM - MORNING

Rob stares at the ceiling as Marie sleeps on next to him.

ROB (V.O.)
But in the morning we were just two
people, slightly hung-over, who were
not in love, sharing the same space.
And I feel...

Rob looks to the camera.

ROB

Sex is about the only grown-up thing
that I know how to do; It's weird,
then, that it's the only thing that

can make me feel like a ten-year-
old.

CUT BACK TO:

EXT. MARIE'S APARTMENT - MORNING

The two of them come out of the building and into the street.

ROB

Which way are you going?

MARIE
(points left)
That way.	You?

ROB

(points right)
That way.

MARIE
And so it is.	I'll talk to you later.

ROB
I'll call you.

MARIE

(smiles)
Right.

INT. RECORD STORE - DAY

Empty. Dick prices records out on the floor. Rob leans against the register. Barry sits on a stool next to him.

They're top-fiving it.	Rob's heart isn't in it.

ROB
Okay.	Top five side one track ones.
Number one... "Janie Jones," the

Clash, from The Clash.

BARRY
 
Ehh.

ROB
"Thunder Road," Bruce Springsteen,
from Born to Run. "Smells Like Teen
Spirit," Nirvana, Nevermind.

BARRY
Oh no, Rob, that's not obvious enough.
Not at all.	Dick, did you hear that?

ROB

Shut up. "Let's Get It On," Marvin
Gaye, from Let's Get It On. "Airbag,"
Radiohead, from OK Computer.

BARRY

(sarcastic)
Ooh!	A kind of recent record!	Rob's

sly declaration of new classic-status
slipped into a list of old classics!
Nice! "Let's Get It On?" Couldn't

you make it more obvious than that?

DICK
Rob.	Phone.
(whispers)

It's Laura.

Rob springs to his feet, takes the phone and walks to the end of the cord. Deep breath.

ROB
Hi.

LAURA - INTERCUT

LAURA
Hi.	I've been looking for an envelope
of my receipts from last month and
I'm thinking I didn't take them with
me.	Have you seen them around?

ROB

I'll look for 'em.	How you doing?

LAURA

I'm sorry to call, but I need that
stuff...

ROB
Fine, I'm sure it's in the file at
home.	I'll call you when I find it,
and then we'll talk.

LAURA
We'll talk some other time.

ROB

Great... That's great.
 
Rob comes back to the counter and hangs up the phone.

BARRY

Rob!	What about the Beatles?	What
about the fucking Rolling Stones?
What about fucking... fucking...

Beethoven?	Track one side one of
the Fifth Symphony?	You shouldn't
be allowed to run a record shop.
You shouldn't be allowed to --

SFX: BARRY'S VOICE FADES OUT. Rob's mouth slacks and he stares off.

ROB (V.O.)
There's something different about
the sound of her voice... And what
did she mean last night, she hasn't

slept with him yet.	Yet.	What does
"yet" mean, anyway?	"I haven't
seen... Evil Dead II yet." What does

that mean?	It means you're going to
go, doesn't it?

SFX: BACK TO THE ROOM.

BARRY

--	You're like a little squirrel of music, storing away dead little nuts of old garbage music, musical lint, old shit, shit, shit --

ROB

--	Barry, if I were to say to you I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet, what would that mean?

Barry just looks at Rob. He pulls out a Game Boy and begins playing.

ROB

Just... come on, what would it mean
to you?	That sentence? "I haven't
seen Evil Dead II yet?"

BARRY

To me, it would mean that you're a
liar.	You saw it twice.	Once with

Laura -- oops -- once with me and
Dick.	We had that conversation about
the possibilities of the guy making

ammo off-screen in the Fourteenth
Century.

ROB
Yeah, yeah, I know.	But say I hadn't

seen it and I said to you, "I haven't
seen Evil Dead II yet," what would
you think?
 
Barry shuts off the Game Boy.

BARRY

I'd think you were a cinematic idiot.
And I'd feel sorry for you.

ROB
No, but would you think, from that
one sentence.	That I was going to
see it?

BARRY
I'm sorry, Rob, but I'm struggling
here.	I don't understand any part
of this conversation.	You're asking
me what I would think if you told me

that you hadn't seen a film that
you've seen.	What am I supposed to

say?

ROB

Just listen to me.	If I said to you --

BARRY
"-- I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet,"
yeah, yeah, I hear you --

ROB

Would you... would you get the
impression that I wanted to see it?

BARRY
Well... you couldn't have been

desperate to see it, otherwise you'd
have already gone...

Rob brightens.	Barry finally considers.

BARRY
...But the word "yet..." Yeah, you
know what, I'd get the impression

that you wanted to see it.	Otherwise
you'd say you didn't really want to.

ROB
But in your opinion, would I
definitely go?

BARRY
How the fuck am I supposed to know
that?	You might get sick of people

telling you you've really gotta go
see the movie.

Rob darkens.

ROB
Why would they care?
 
BARRY
Because it's a brilliant film.	It's

funny, violent, and the soundtrack
kicks fucking ass.

They look at each other for a strange moment.

BARRY
I never thought I would say this,
but can I go work now?

ROB

Let's pack it up.	We haven't had a
customer in four hours.

Barry stands.

BARRY
Fine by me.	I still want pay to 7

o'clock.

ROB

Ha.

DICK
I can't go to the club tonight, guys.

BARRY
Why?

Dick smiles sheepishly.

BARRY
Who are you going to see?

DICK
Nobody.

Barry's eyes widen.

BARRY
Rob, looky looky.	Dick!	Are you
getting some?!

Silence.

BARRY

Un-fucking-believable.	Dick's out
on a hot date, Rob's boning Marie

LaSalle, and the best-looking and
most intelligent of all of us isn't
getting anything at all.

ROB

How do you know about that?

BARRY

Oh come on, Rob.	What am I, an idiot?
I'm more bothered by Dick's thing.
How did this happen, Dick?	What
 
rational explanation can there
possibly be?	What's her name?

Barry is going a little hard.	Dick shrinks back.

DICK
Anna.

BARRY

Anna who?	Anna Green Gables?	Anna
Conda?

DICK
Anna Moss.

BARRY
Anna Moss.	Mossy.	The Mossy Thing.
The Swamp Thing.	Is she all green
and furry?

ROB
Shut the fuck up, Barry.

BARRY

Yeah, you would say that, wouldn't
you?	You two have to stick together
now.	Boners United.	United in

getting some.

Barry picks up his bag and heads for the door.

ROB

Don't be sad, Barry.	You'll find
true love someday.

BARRY
Suck my ass.

ROB

Terrific.

Rob looks to Dick, who looks guilty.

ROB

Don't worry about it, Dick.	Barry's
an asshole.

DICK
Yeah... Well... I'll see you tomorrow,

Rob.

Dick exits. Rob watches the door close behind him, and looks out over the empty store. He TALKS TO CAMERA as he goes to the light switches and begins shutting them off, one by one...

ROB
Why does it bother Barry that much

that Dick is seeing someone?	He's
worried about how his life is turning
out, and he's lonely, and lonely
 
people are the bitterest of them
all.

...until all the lights are out. Rob's silhouette slips out the door.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

A downpour is on. Rob has himself wedged into a phone booth, the little kind.

ROB

(into phone)
Hi.	It's me... I'm right outside...

I	know... I know... I figured I could just walk you to the train and you could go... home. Or whatever it is... No! Of course not -- okay. I'll be right here.

EXT. OFFICE BUILDING

Rob stands under the overhang, watching Laura walk the long hallway from the elevators to the door.

ROB (V.O.)
Laura looks different.	Less stress-
out, more in control.	Something has
happened, maybe something real, or
maybe something in her head.	Whatever
it is, you can see that she thinks
she's started out on some new stage

in her life.	She hasn't.	I'm not
going to let her.

She emerges from doors, says something to him and they start walking, sharing her umbrella.

INT. OLDE TOWNE ALE HOUSE - NIGHT

Rob and Laura have just sat down in a booth.

LAURA
So, how are you?

ROB
Have you slept with him yet?

LAURA

I told you I slept with him.

ROB

No, not -- I mean have you, you know --

LAURA
Is that why you wanted to see me?

ROB
I guess.
 
LAURA
Oh, Rob.	What do you want me to

say?

ROB
I want you to say that you haven't,
and I want it to be the truth.

She looks past him.

LAURA
I can't do that.

She starts to say something else but Rob is up and out.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Rob pushes through the rush hour raincoats, seeming to be the only one going his way.

INT. ROB'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Rob is soaking, slumped in his chair, his headphones on and the stereo lit up behind him. He talks a little loud, due to the headphones.

ROB

Tonight we're gonna figure out the
five best angry songs about women.
Let's go...

He holds up a stack of records and CDs.

ROB

You kind of have to start with Elvis
Costello, but where? "Motel Matches?"
"I Want You?" "I Hope You're Happy

Now?" "Green Shirt?" His records
should be sealed in cases that say
"in case of vicious betrayal, smash
glass." "Where Did You Sleep Last
Night," sure, but by Robert Johnson

or by Nirvana?	Maybe a Liz Phair
track.	There are a couple to get
angry at instead of being angry with.
Some devil's advocate stuff.	The
Silver Jews could be good when you're

ready to start putting it all behind
you...	But I think we're getting

ahead of ourselves there.	Ah.	Dylan.
Bob fucking Dylan.	Now Bob Dylan
would --The phone rings.	He pulls

off his headphones and picks it up
but says nothing.

LAURA (O.S.)
You must have known it would happen.

You couldn't have been entirely
unprepared.	Like you said, I've
been living with the guy.	We were
 
bound to get around to it sometime.

She laughs a bit nervously.

LAURA (O.S.)
(machine)
And anyway, I keep trying to tell

you, that's not really the point, is
it?	The point is we got ourselves
into an awful mess, Rob...	Are you
there?	What are you thinking?

ROB
(barely a whisper)
Nothing.

LAURA (O.S.)

We can meet for another drink if you
want.	So I can explain it better.

I owe you that much.

ROB

Look, I gotta go.	I work too, you
know.

LAURA (O.S.)
Will you call me?

ROB

I don't have your number.

LAURA (O.S.)

Call me at work.	We can arrange to
meet properly.	I don't want this to

be the last conversation we have.	I
know what you're like.

ROB
You do, huh.

He hangs up and stares at the wall for awhile. He gets a beer from the fridge and sits back down. He picks up the phone and dials.

ROB
Yes, a residence, a Mr. Ian Raymond,
North Side... thank you.

He writes down a number and hangs up, then looks to camera.

ROB
You know the worst thing about being
rejected?	The complete lack of
control due to loss of control.

He picks up the phone and dials, while continuing to talk to us --

ROB

If I could only control the when and
 
how of being dumped by somebody then
it wouldn't seem as bad.	But then,

of course --

He hangs up quickly --

ROB

--	it wouldn't be rejection, would it? It would be mutual consent. It would be musical differences. I would be pursuing a solo career.

CUT TO:

EXT. IAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Rob is tucked into a phone booth across the street. He can see the silhouettes of Laura and Ian in the window. He picks up the phone, drops a quarter, and hits the numbers hard as he dials... a muffled male "hello?" is heard and Rob hangs up. He does it again. And again. And again. Until --

INT. IAN'S APARTMENT - INTERCUT

Still an unpacked box or two, but it's set up: a framed "Woodstock - The Movie" poster, stacks of new fiction, a bread maker -- you get the idea. Ian is shorter than Laura, scruffier than Rob, and looks not unlike Leo Sayer/Steve Guttenberg. He stares at Laura with amused exasperation.

She picks up the phone --

LAURA
Hello.

ROB
It's me.

LAURA

I figured it was.
(re: traffic noise)
Where are you?

ROB

I think the big question here is
where are you, if you don't mind my
saying so, and I think I know where

you are.	You're running.	On the
run.	You're running from a point

that everyone hits in any
relationship, and you're just going
to hit it again with Ian but it's

going to be with a World Music bunny-
rabbit-looking earth-shoe-wearing
"Doctor Who"-watching twit who doesn't
really understand you, not the way
that I do and will more in the future,

and you'll have just wasted more
time and arrive in the exact same
place that you're in now, only later.
 
And with... him.

LAURA
I'm not -- hold on...

She walks into another room, shutting the door behind her.

On a bookshelf is a picture of a younger Ian in a tunic, emoting on some college stage. She turns it face down.

LAURA
I'm not in love with Ian, okay?

She wanders over to the window, looking out absently. She sees Rob down there at the phone booth.

ROB

Are you still in love with me?

LAURA
Jesus.	I do not know.	I'll talk to
you later.

ROB

Think about what I said.	I mean, if
you want to experiment, or whatever --

LAURA
(indignant)
I'm not experimenting.	Why don't
you go experiment.

ROB
I don't want to.	Don't need to.	I

love you.

LAURA

You don't ever think about other
people?

ROB
No... not really... I mean, I think
about it... but no, I don't really
think about it.

IAN (O.S.)
(through the door)
Laura?	Are you okay?

LAURA
(covering the
mouthpiece, to Ian)

I	am fine...
(to Rob)
I gotta go.	Goodbye.

She clicks the phone off. The door cracks and Ian sticks his head in.

IAN
 
Are you sure you're okay?

She moves past him back into the apartment.

LAURA
Yeah, I'm fine.	I'm off the phone.

IAN
You look upset.

LAURA
I'm upset, but I'm fine.

IAN

Maybe I should talk to him.

LAURA

Mmmm, no.	Not a good idea.

IAN
Conflict resolution is my job, Laura.

LAURA
Nothing to resolve, Ian.	Let's get
a drink.

She grabs her coat and opens the door. The phone begins to ring.

LAURA
(waving toward the
door)

C'mon, c'mon.

EXT. IAN'S APARTMENT

Rob stands on the sidewalk in the rain, Ian's building behind him and down a few doors.

ROB
I wish I could be one of those guys
who doesn't call, the kind of guy

that gets broken up with and appears
not to give a shit.	He doesn't make
an ass out of himself, or frighten
anybody, and this week I've done
both of those things.	One day Laura's

sorry and guilty, and the next she's
scared and angry, and I'm entirely

responsible for the transformation,
and it doesn't do my case any good
at all.	I'd stop if I could but I --

His head turns at the sharp SOUND of a door opening -- Ian and Laura are coming out of the building. He jumps behind a tree, peering around it as they fade down the street.

INT. GREEN MILL - NIGHT

Rob sits alone, nursing a scotch.	Rob looks up into the
 
mirror behind the bar and sees an older woman, MRS. ASHWORTH, sitting alone a few stools down.

ROB

Do I know you?

ALISON'S MOM

I don't know.

Rob remembers, and his gaze has a new found seriousness.

ROB

You're Mrs. Ashworth.	I'm Rob.	An
old boyfriend of you're daughter's.

Alison's Mom's brow furrows and her face darkens.

ROB
Alison's.

ALISON'S MOM
Really.

ROB

Long time ago.	I was just thinking
about her.	I was her first boyfriend.

ALISON'S MOM What did you say your name was?

ROB
Rob.	Rob Gordon.	Circa junior
high...

ALISON'S MOM

I hate to quibble with you Rob, but
she married her first boyfriend.
Kevin Bannister.

ROB

You gotta be kidding me.

ALISON'S MOM

That's right.	Kevin.	She's Mrs.
Kevin Bannister.	She lives in
Australia.

She doesn't seem too happy that Alison lives in Australia.

Rob is thrilled.

ROB
Really?	Married Kevin?	Her junior
high sweetheart... What chance would
I have had against that?	None, no
chance.	That's just fate.

ALISON'S MOM

I beg your pardon?

ROB
 
Technically, I'm number one.	I went
out with her a week before Kevin

did.	Her first boyfriend.	Me.

She stands.

ALISON'S MOM

Well Rob, I'll tell her you said
hello.	If she remembers you.

Alison's Mom strolls out.

ROB
(calling after her)
I think she will.	But it's okay if
she doesn't.	I'm fine now.

Rob turns to the bartender, smiling giddily.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Rob walks through Uptown toward the train.

ROB

And suddenly I am fine.	For the
moment there is not one extra pound
on my chest.	This is fate.	Alison

married Kevin.	You get it?	That's
fate.	That's got nothing to do with
me, that is beyond my control, beyond
my fault...

CUT TO:

ROB IN HIS CHAIR

Rob into camera, digging through a box, fishing through pictures and letters, concert tickets and other mementos.

He begins to assemble a small pile of pictures of women.

ROB

I want to see the others on the Big
Top Five.	Penny, who wouldn't let
me touch her and then went and had
sex with that bastard Chris Thompson.
Sarah, my partner in rejection who

rejected me, and Charlie, who I have
to thank for everything: my great

job, my sexual self-confidence, the
works.	There's this Springsteen
song, "Bobby Jean," off Born in the

USA.	About a girl who's left town
years before and he's pissed off
because he didn't know about it, and
he wanted to say goodbye, tell her
that he missed her, and wish her

good luck.	Well, I'd like my life
to be like a Springsteen song.	Just
once.	I know I'm not born to run,
 
and it's clear that Halsted Street
is nothing like Thunder Road, but

feelings can't be that different,
can they?	I'd like to call up all
those people and ask them how they
are and whether they've forgiven me,
and tell them that I have forgiven

them.	And say good luck, goodbye.
No hard feelings.	And then they'd
feel good and I'd feel good.	We'd
all feel good.	I'd feel clean, and
calm, and ready to start again.

That'd be good.	Great even.

CUT BACK TO:

INT. ROB'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Rob holds an old crumpled address book in one hand and the phone in the other.

ROB

Penny Hardwick?	This is Rob Gordon...
From High school... Yeah.

EXT. MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT

Rob and Penny walk out of the theater mid-conversation.

They look happy as they walk down the street.

ROB (V.O.)

Penny is as beautiful as she was in
high school when I broke it off with

her because she wouldn't sleep with
me.	In fact she's even more
beautiful, and really grown into

herself.

INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

A mid-scale trattoria. Rob and Penny sit at table laughing and talking. If we didn't know better we might think there is chemistry.

ROB (V.O.)
She tells me about her life, and I
get it.	And I tell about mine, and
she's interested.

CLOSE-UP -- ROB TALKING

ROB (V.O.)
And then, with no real explanation,
I just launch into it: I tell her
about Laura and Ian, and Charlie and
Marco, and about Alison Ashworth and

Kevin Bannister...

ROB
 
...and you wanted to sleep with Chris
Thompson instead of me, and... and I

thought you could help me understand
why it keeps happening, why I'm doomed
to be left, doomed to be rejected
and...

He slows to a stop. We see Penny as she goes from happy to livid.

PENNY
Rob.	I was crazy about you.	I wanted
to sleep with you, one day, but not
when I was sixteen.	When you broke
up with me -- when you broke up with
me -- because I was, to use your
charming expression, tight, I cried

and cried and I hated you.	And then
that little shitbag asked me out,

and I was too tired to fight him
off, and it wasn't rape because I
said okay, but it wasn't far off.

And I didn't have sex with anyone
else until after college because I
hated it so much.	And now you want
to have a chat about rejection?
Well, fuck you, Rob.

Penny stands and leaves.	Rob just sits.

ROB
(cheerful)
So that's another one I don't have
to worry about.	I should have done

this years ago.

Rob indicates to an off-screen waiter.

ROB

Check...

ROB IN HIS CHAIR

Rob to camera.

ROB
Sarah's easy to find.	She still
sends me Christmas cards with her
address and phone number on them.

They never say anything else, except
for "Merry Christmas, Love Sarah." I
send her equally blank ones back.

INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY - NIGHT - ROB'S POV

of a door opening, revealing Sarah, a few years older but still pretty in her mousey way. She looks at Rob with a bit too much in her eyes.

INT. CARMEN'S PIZZA - NIGHT
 
Rob and Sarah face each other over a half-eaten pizza.

SARAH

I can't believe I left you for him...
Crazy.

Sarah looks down at her plate, shaking her head, blushing.

Rob looks uncomfortable. This is more than he was looking for.

ROB
Well... probably seemed like a good
idea at the time.

She looks up again...

SARAH

Probably.	I can't remember why,
though.

...and back down again.

ROB (V.O.)
I haven't got the heart for the
rejection conversation.	There are

no hard feelings here, and I am glad
that she ditched me, and not the
other way around.

INT./EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY - NIGHT

Sarah, in the doorway, smiles painfully. It's clear she doesn't want to shut the door, but she does. Rob turns and walks down the hall toward the door to the street as he talks TO CAMERA.

ROB

I could've ended up having sex back
there.	And what better way to
exorcize rejection demons than to

screw the person who rejected you,
right?	But you wouldn't be sleeping
with a person.	You'd be sleeping
with a whole sad single-person
culture.	It'd be like sleeping with

Talia Shire in "Rocky" if you weren't
Rocky.

INT. ROB'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

CLOSE-UP: PHONE BOOK

as Rob's finger moves down the column, then stops.

Rob looks up with a little shock, almost recoiling from the phone book.

CUT TO:
 
ROB IN HIS CHAIR

Rob to camera.

ROB
Charlie's in the fucking phone book.
She has come to assume such an
importance, I feel she should be
living on Mars.	She's an
extraterrestrial, a ghost, a myth,
not a person with an answering

machine, in the phone book... I call
and hang up on her voice mail a couple
of times, then I leave my name and
number and throw in a "long time-no-
see..." I don't hear anything back

from her for a few days.	Now that's
more like it, if you're talking about

rejection: someone who won't even
return your phone messages a decade
after she rejected you.

INT. RECORD STORE - DAY

Rob hears the door open as he stocks shelves, and turns.

It's Ian.	Rob reacts, gunfighter eyes.

ROB
Can I help you?

IAN
Hello, Rob.	Remember me?	I'm Ray.

Ian.

Rob says nothing.

IAN

I thought maybe we should talk.
Sort a few things out?

Rob is disoriented on the way to angry. Dick and Barry's ears perk up.

ROB
What needs sorting out?

IAN

Come on, Rob.	My relationship with
Laura has obviously disturbed you a
great deal.

ROB

Funnily enough I haven't been too
thrilled about it.

IAN
We are not talking jokey
understatement here, Rob.	We're
 
talking actionable harassment.	Ten
phone calls a night, hanging around

outside my house...

ROB
Yeah, well, I've stopped all that
now.

IAN

We've noticed and we're glad.	But,
you know... how are we going to make
peace here?	We want to make things

easier for you.	What can we do?
Obviously I know how special Laura
is, and I know things can't be good
for you at the moment.	I'd hate it
if I lost her.	But I'd like to think

that if she decided she didn't want
to see me anymore, I'd respect that

decision.	Do you see what I'm saying?

ROB

Yeah.

IAN
Good.	So shall we leave it at that
then?

ROB

I dunno.

IAN

Think about it, Rob.

CUT TO FANTASY #1:

Rob looking sure of himself, righteous.

IAN

Good.	So shall we leave it at that
then?

ROB
I've already left it, you pathetic
rebound fuck!	Now get your patchouli
stink out of my store.

Ian leaves, rattled.

CUT TO FANTASY #2:

Same thing.

IAN

Good.	So shall we leave it at that
then?

ROB
We won't leave it, Ian.	Not ever.
 
Rob springs toward Ian, but Barry blocks his way. Dick helps hold Rob back.

DICK

Don't do it, Rob!

BARRY

He's not worth it!

Rob reaches a pointed finger over Barry's shoulder.

ROB

Leave town.	Leave the country, you
little bitch, because you're gonna
look back on walks by the house and
ten phone calls a night as a golden
age.	Get ready, mutherfucker.

Ian trips backward and scurries out the door.

CUT TO FANTASY #3:

Rob, Dick, and Barry just beating the living shit out of Ian, Rodney King style. Ian lies on the floor trying to cover himself. Dick, already out of breath, breaks from the pack and jerks the air conditioner from the wall and hefts it over his head, preparing for the death blow.

CUT BACK TO REALITY

IAN
So shall we leave it at that then?

ROB

I dunno.

IAN

Think about it, Rob.

Ian walks out. Rob looks spent. He shuffles toward the back of the store.

INT. RECORD STORE - BACK ROOM - DAY

Rob is laying on his back, staring at the ceiling. Dick sticks his head in the door.

DICK
Phone, Rob.	Somebody named Charlie.

Rob pulls the phone into the bathroom and shuts the door.

BATHROOM
Rob curls up with the phone.

ROB
Hello?

INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - INTERCUT
 
Charlie looks even better than when we saw her in college.

CHARLIE
Rob, hi, so sorry I missed your call.
In LA on business.	You know how it
gets.

ROB
Yeah, sure...

CHARLIE
Good.	Great.	Yeah... Wow.	Rob
Gordon.	Seems like a 100 million
years ago now.

ROB
Yeah.	A billion.	Right... How are
you?

CHARLIE
Fantastic but I'm a little busy right
now.	Listen.	Do you want to come

to dinner Saturday?	I'm having some
friends over and I need a spare man.
Are you a spare man?

ROB

Uh...yes, at the moment.

CHARLIE
Great.	Gotta go.	See you then.

INT. CHARLIE'S DINING ROOM

SERIES OF SHOTS OVER THE COURSE OF DINNER

Sexy version of a hip wine commercial: a small mid-thirties crowd of successful, beautiful people. Rob sits at the table silently as the other guests talk and eat. Rob's central activities are working his way through maybe a few too many wines making sure his cigarette smoke doesn't get in anyone's face. His eyes occasionally dart around the table, but he says nothing to anyone.

CUT TO:

INT. CHARLIE'S LIVING ROOM - LATER

Rob is a little too settled into the couch, somewhat bleary.

Everyone gone but the two of them, Charlie plops down into a chair across from Rob.

ROB

Hey Charlie.

CHARLIE

Hey Rob.

ROB
 
Why did you break up with me for
Marco?

CHARLIE

(on her feet)
Fuck!	I knew it!	You're going
through one of those what-does-it-

all-mean things.

ROB
Huh?

CHARLIE
There's been a rash of them, recently.
I find it a little unnerving.	In
fact Marco called a few months back,
and he wanted to see me, and rehash

the past as they say, and I wasn't
really up for it.	Do all men go

through this?

ROB

C'mon, just answer the question.
You can say what you like.	What the
hell?

Charlie looks off at a corner of the ceiling, musters a look of "contemplation."

CHARLIE
It's all kind of lost in the... in
the dense mists of time now... It

wasn't that I really liked Marco
more.	In fact I thought you were

more, shall we say, attractive than
him.	It was just that he knew he
was good-looking and you didn't, and

that made a difference somehow.	You
used to act as if I was weird for
wanting to spend time with you, and
that got kind of beat, if you know
what I mean.	Your self-image started

to rub off on me and I ended up
thinking that I was strange.	And I
knew that you were kind and
thoughtful... you made me laugh, and
I dug the way you got consumed by

things you loved... and Marco seemed
a bit more, I don't know, glamorous?

More sure of himself?
(pause)
Less hard work, because I felt like

I was dragging you around, sort of.
(pause)
A little sunnier.	Sparkier.
(pause)
I don't know.	You know what people

are like at that age.	They make
very superficial judgements.	Do you
think that's superficial?	He was a
 
clown, if it's any consolation.

ROB
Did you tell that to Marco when he
did his what-does-it-all-mean thing
with you?

CHARLIE
Oh God, no.	I didn't want to hurt
his feelings.

CUT TO:

ROB IN HIS CHAIR

Rob to camera.

ROB
I wanted the works and I got it.

None of Alison Ashworth's fate, none
of Sarah's rewriting of history, and
no reminder that I'd got all the

rejection stuff a little backward,
like I did about Penny.	Just a
perfectly clear explanation of why
some people have it and some don't.
All I've learned from Charlie is

that maybe my one talent, my genius
for being normal, is a little
overrated.

CUT TO:

INT. RECORD STORE - DAY

Rob enters the already open store, in a bad mood, to find
Barry putting up a poster.	It reads:

"BARRYTOWN/appearing Saturday night/Bucktown Pub"

BARRY
Hey.

ROB

What the fuck is that?

BARRY

My band.

ROB
What band?

BARRY
The band that found me and asked me
to join.

ROB

You are not in a band, Barry.	You
are not a musician.	And no posters.
 
BARRY
Thanks for your support, Rob.	Really

appreciate it.

ROB
Barrytown.	Barrytown?	Is there no
end to your arrogance?

BARRY

I didn't make up the name.	It's the
Steely Dan song.	And it was in The
Commitments.

ROB

You can't be called Barry and sing
in a group called Barrytown.

BARRY
They were fucking called that before

I was in it, okay?	It wasn't my
idea.

ROB
That's why you got the gig, isn't
it?

Barry says nothing.

ROB

Isn't it?

BARRY

That was one of the reasons they
asked me to join originally, yes.

But --

ROB

Great!	That's fucking great!	They
only asked you to sing because of
your name!	You can stick it above
the browser racks over there.

BARRY
How many tickets can I put you down
for?

ROB

None.	Christ!

BARRY
You're not even coming?

ROB
Of course I'm not coming.	Do I look
like I'd want to listen to some
terrible experimental racket played
in some hideous cave?	Where is it?

(looks at the poster)
The fucking Bucktown Pub?	Ha!
 
BARRY
So much for friends, then.	You're a

bitter bastard, Rob, you know that?

ROB
Bitter?	Because I'm not in Barrytown?
You should be shot like a lame horse,

you jerk.
(re: the poster)
Just keep that out of my window.

INT. ROB'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Rob opens the door to find Laura filling a duffel bag in the living room.

LAURA

I called and called but you were
out.	I thought I'd be gone before

you got back.

ROB

Is that the last of it?

LAURA
Yep.	I might have missed some stuff.
I'm so used to some things being

here that I don't even notice them.

ROB
Those look heavy.	Where's Ian?

LAURA
He's at home.	Listen, I can't believe

he went to the store.	I'm mortified,
actually.	I'm really sorry.	He had
no right to do that, and I told him

so.

ROB
It was kind of funny.

They smile.

LAURA
I'm sure.

ROB
You still together?	Going all right?

LAURA
I don't really want to talk about
it, to be honest.

ROB
That bad, eh?

LAURA
You know what I mean.
 
Rob flops onto the couch and surveys the room.

ROB
It's a dump, isn't it?

Laura sits down, on the other side of the couch.

LAURA
Fix it up.	It'll make you feel
better.

ROB

I'll bet you can't remember what you
were doing here, can you?	I mean,
how much are you making now?	Sixty?
Seventy?	And you were living in
this shitty place.

LAURA

You know I didn't mind.	And it's
not as if Ray's place is any better.

ROB
I'm sorry, but can we get this
straight?	What is his fucking name,
Ian or Ray?	What do you call him?

LAURA
Ray.	I hate Ian.

ROB
I hate him too.	So I just call him
"Mavis." Or "Sissyboy." Or "Mavis
the Sissyboy."

Laura starts laughing, laying on the couch on her back, very close to Rob. Rob leans in, sort of looking down into her eyes.
