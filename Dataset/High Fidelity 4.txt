ROB
This is where you're supposed to say
that you haven't laughed this much

in ages, and then you see the error
of your ways.

LAURA
You make me laugh much more than Ray
does, if that's what you're getting
at.	But I already knew you could

make me laugh.	It's everything else
I don't know about.

ROB
You know I'm a good person.

LAURA
Mmm hmm.

ROB

You know that I can cook my ass off
 
when I feel like it.

LAURA
Oh ho, so very infrequently.

He moves a little closer.

ROB
You know my favorite beverage is
your bath water.

She laughs. He moves in, not really trying to kiss her but leaving the door open for her... She almost goes for it, but instead gets to her feet.

LAURA
Time to go.

She goes to her bags.	Rob points to a pile of CDs.

ROB
Don't forget your CDs.

LAURA

Those aren't mine.

ROB

Sure they are.

LAURA
They're not really, though, are they?
I know you bought them for me, and

that was really sweet of you, but
that was when you were trying to

turn me into you.	I can't take them,
I know they'd just sit around staring
at me, and I'd feel embarrassed by

them and... they don't fit in with
the rest of what's mine, do you
understand?	That Sting record you
bought for me... that was a present
for me.	I like Sting and you hate

him.	But the rest of this stuff...
(bending down to the
pile)
Who the hell is Nick Lowe?	Or Gram
Parsons?	Or the Boredoms?	I don't

know these people.	I...

ROB
Okay, okay.	I get the picture.

LAURA
I'm sorry to go on about it.	But, I
don't know, there's a lesson here
somewhere, and I want to make sure
you get it.

ROB

I got it.	You like Sting but you
 
don't like Gram Parsons, because
you've never heard of him.

LAURA

You're being deliberately obtuse.

ROB

I guess I am.

LAURA
Well, think about it.

She hefts the duffel bag, opens the door and exits.

ROB
Fuck.

CUT TO:

ROB IN HIS CHAIR

Rob to the camera.

ROB

What's the point in thinking about
it?	If I ever have another
relationship, I'll buy her, whoever

she is, stuff that she oughta like
but doesn't know about -- that's
what new boyfriends are for.	And
hopefully I won't borrow money from
her, or have an affair, and she won't

need to have an abortion or run away
with the neighborhood, and then there

won't be anything to think about.
Laura didn't run off with Ian because
I bought her CDs she wasn't that

keen on, and to pretend otherwise is
just... just... psychowank.	If she
thinks that, then she's missing the
Brazilian rainforest for the twigs.
If I can't buy the Plastic People of

the Universe's first album for new
girlfriends, then I might as well
give up, because I'm not sure I know
how to do anything else.

CUT TO:

EXT. STREET - MORNING

Rob walks toward the record store, and looks into a Starbuck's window he passes. He stops for a second, seeing Ian at the counter, chatting merrily with the espresso jockey. Rob keeps walking.

INT. RECORD STORE - BACK ROOM - DAY

Rob tosses his coat down and picks up the phone and dials...
 
LAURA (O.S.)
(muffled, almost a

whisper)
Hello.

ROB
Hey, how ya doin'?

No answer.

ROB
Guess who I just saw, right by my
store?	Ian.	In Starbuck's.	Neat,
huh?

LAURA (O.S.)
I can't talk right now.

ROB

God, that's a cold and a half.	Maybe
you should bet back in bed.

No response.

ROB
Are you alright?

LAURA (O.S.)
Pigsty.

ROB
Don't worry about it.	Just get into
bed.	Worry about that when you're
better.

LAURA (O.S.)
Pig died.

ROB

Who the fuck's Pig?

LAURA (O.S.)

(louder)
My dad died.	My dad, my dad.

She hangs up.

FRONT ROOM

Rob comes out of the back, in a daze.	Dick and Barry notice.

BARRY

What's up?

ROB
Laura.	Her dad died.

BARRY
Ooh.	Drag.
 
Barry goes back to his comic book and burrito.

DICK
I'm sorry, Rob, that's, it's --

ROB
You're a horrible person, Barry.	I
mean it.

Barry looks up at him, shrugs, then gets an idea.

BARRY

Hey.	Top five songs about death.	A
Laura's Dad Tribute list.

Nobody can help thinking about it.

BARRY
Okay, okay -- "Leader of the Pack."

The guy fucking cracks up on a cycle
and dies right? "Dead Man's Curve,"
Jan and Dean...

DICK

Did you know that after that song
was recorded, Jan himself crashed
his --

BARRY

-- It was Dean, you fucking idiot.

ROB

It was Jan, and it was a long time
after--

BARRY
Whatever.	Okay. "Tell Laura I Love
Her." That'd bring the house down.
Laura's mom could sing it.

ROB
Fuck off, Barry.

BARRY

I'd want "One Step Beyond" by Madness.
And "You Can't Always Get What You
Want."

ROB

Because it's in The Big Chill.

BARRY

Haven't seen it.

ROB
Liar.	We saw it in the Lawrence
Kasdan double-bill with Body Heat.

BARRY

Oh.	Right.	But I'd forgotten about
 
that.	I wasn't biting the idea.

ROB
Not really.

The phone RINGS.	Rob picks it up.

ROB
Record Exchange.

INTERCUT - IAN'S APARTMENT

Laura is curled up on the couch.	Dick and Barry keep listing.

LAURA
I'm sorry.

ROB
No, no.	When are you going home?

LAURA
In a minute.	When I get it together.

BARRY

(to Dick)
What about Sabbath?	Or Nirvana?
They're into death.

Rob tries to signal to them to shut up but they don't see him. He moves as far away as the cord will let me.

ROB

Can I do anything?

DICK
"Abraham, Martin, and John." That's
a nice one.

BARRY

"Somebody's Gonna Die" by Blitz.
"Bella Lugosi's Dead," Bauhaus.
It's got that creepy Halloween

feeling.

LAURA
No.	No.	Mom wants you to come to
the funeral.	It's on Friday.

ROB

Me?

LAURA

My dad liked you.	And Mom never
told him we'd split, because he wasn't
up to it and... oh, I don't know.	I
don't really understand it.	I think
she thinks he'll be able to see what's

going on.	It's like...
(small laugh)
He's been through so much, what with
 
dying and everything, that she doesn't
want to upset him any more than she

has to.

ROB
Do you want me to be there?

LAURA
I don't care.	As long as you don't
expect me to hold your hand.

Rob is silent.

LAURA

Look, are you coming or not?

ROB

Yes, of course.

LAURA
Liz'll give you a lift.	She knows
where to go and everything... I don't

have time to talk, Rob.	I've got
too much to do.

ROB
Sure.	I'll see you on Friday.

She hangs up.

BARRY
(to the tune of "Candle
In the Wind")
"Goodbye Laura's dad/blah blah la di

da di da/
(belting it out)
Seems to me/you lived your life/like

a dentist in the wind...

Rob stomps toward Barry, who jumps over the counter to keep singing --

INT. LIZ'S CAR - DAY

THUNDERCLAPS and RAIN. Rob is in a somber suit, looking through the windshield wipers as Liz drives.

ROB
So the minister says nice things,

and then, what, we all troop outside
and they bury him?

LIZ
It's a crematorium.

ROB
You're kidding.	A crematorium?

Jesus.

LIZ
 
What difference does it make?

ROB
Is Ray going?

LIZ
No.	They don't know him.	And Ken
liked you.	Rob, Ken didn't die for
your benefit, you know.	It's like
everybody's a supporting actor in
the film of your life story.

ROB
Isn't that how it is for everybody?

INT. CHAPEL TWO

Liz and Rob sit in the back of the dark, smallish nondenominational room. At the front is a coffin, resting on a stand. Laura, her younger sister JO, and her mother sit in the front row, listening to the MINISTER.

MINISTER
...Now and forever, Amen.

He nods "offstage," and a muffled mechanical noise is heard.

The coffin begins to lower through a trap door beneath it.

A low, baleful human HOWL is heard, starting quietly but gaining in volume.

ROB (V.O.)
I hear something in Laura's voice,

but I know what it is, and at that
moment I want to go to her and offer
to become a different person, to

remove all trace of what is me, as
long as she will let me look after
her and try to make her feel better...

INT. CHAPEL PARLOR

Rob stays back, watching mourners approach Laura and her mother, hugging them. After awhile, Laura sees Rob through the throng, hanging back. She breaks through and to him, holding him close for a long time...

ROB (V.O.)

...And when she let's go of me, I
feel I don't need to become a
different person.	It's happened

already.

INT. LAURA'S PARENTS' HOUSE - AFTERNOON

A cozy old Victorian house, full of things -- furniture, paintings, ornaments, plants -- which don't go together but which have obviously been chosen with care and taste. Rob and Liz stand, drinking wine. Jo approaches them.
 
LIZ

(to Jo)
How are you?

JO
I'm all right, I suppose.	And Mom's
not too bad.	But Laura... I dunno.

LIZ
She's had a pretty rough few weeks
already, without this.	It's hard

when you're putting all of your
efforts into one part of your life
and it doesn't work out.

She glances at Rob, embarrassed.

ROB

(sincere)
Don't mind me.	No problem.	Just
pretend you're talking about somebody

else.

Jo smiles, Liz gives him a look.

LIZ

We are talking about somebody else.
Laura.	Laura and Ray, actually.

Rob begins to turn red. Anger, sorrow, everything else building.

ROB

Enough, Liz.

LIZ

Enough of what?

ROB
(getting louder)
I know I can't speak now because

Laura's father died, and I just have
to take it because otherwise I'm a
bad guy, with the emphasis on guy,
self-centered.	Well, I'm fucking
not, not all the time, anyway, I'm

really sorry Jo.
(lowering his voice)

But you know, Liz... I can either
stick up for myself or believe
everything you say about me and end

up hating myself.	And maybe you
think I should, but it's not much of
a life, you know?

LIZ

Maybe I've been a little unfair.
But is this really the time?
 
ROB
Only because it's never the time.	I

can't go on apologizing my whole
life, you know?

LIZ
If by "we" you are referring to men,
then I have to say that just the
once would do.

Rob looks around the room, beginning to hyperventilate and near tears. He sees Laura in a corner of the room surrounded by four or five mourners. He crosses to them and breaks through to her.

ROB
I'm sorry.

He breaks away from her and slips out the front door.

EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - AFTERNOON

So darkened by weather that it is almost night, raining torrents and big sheets. Rob emerges from the front door of Laura's parents' house and begins walking down the street, hands thrust into his pockets. The rain almost immediately soaks him.

EXT. ANOTHER STREET

In the distance, Rob runs toward us. As he gets to us we move with him down the street. He is drenched. We hear the rain, and his ragged breath. Headlights appear behind him and backlight him, getting brighter as the sound of an engine gets louder. Rob takes a look over his shoulder, looks desperately left and right, and vaults himself over a small brick wall and into a flower bed, landing on his back in the black wet earth.

The big drops of rain splash mud on his face, and he burrows deeper into the dirt and flowers with his back, panting and staring up at the sky. Off-camera the car engine catches up, and a door opens and shuts. He sighs and shuts his eyes...

He opens his eyes again, to see Laura's face, wet as well, staring down at him. It is difficult to distinguish rain from tears.

LAURA
Are you going to lie in that flower
bed all night?

ROB

Uh... No.

But Rob keeps lying there. Laura pulls herself to a sitting position on the wall just above him.

LAURA
 
You're soaking.

ROB
Mmnn.

LAURA
You're also an idiot.

Rob pulls his muddy self to his feet and sits on the wall next to her.

ROB

I can see why you say that.	Look,
I'm sorry.	I really am.	The last
thing I wanted was... that's why I
left, because... I lost it, and I
didn't want to blow my top in there,

and... look, the reason I fucked
everything up was because I was

scared.	I just wanted you to know,
that's all.

LAURA
Thank you.	I appreciate it.	I can't
reciprocate.

ROB

What do you mean?

LAURA
I didn't mess things up because I
was scared.	I slept with Ray because

I was sick of you.	And I needed
something to snap me out of it.

ROB
Sure, I understand.	Look, I don't
want to take up any more of your
time.	You get back, and I'll wait
here for a bus.

LAURA

I don't want to go back.

ROB
What do you want to do?

LAURA
C'mon.

They swing their legs over the wall and walk to Laura's VW.

INT. LAURA'S CAR - NIGHT

They drive sort of aimlessly through Laura's old neighborhood. Laura sees something on her left, and makes a sudden turn up a narrow road through some overgrown trees. They come to a stop in a formerly paved clearing, looking out on a field with an old abandoned school on the other side. Laura shuts down the engine.
 
ROB

When are you going back?

LAURA
I don't know.	Sometime.	Later.
Listen, Rob, would you have sex with

me?

ROB
What?

LAURA
I want to feel something else than
this.	It's either that or I go home
and put my hand in the fire.	Unless
you want to stub cigarettes out on

my arm.

ROB
I've only got a couple left.	I'm
saving them for later.

LAURA

It'll have to be sex, then.

She pulls herself over him, staddling him in the passenger seat and kissing his neck. She pauses and regards him from above.

LAURA
Hello.	It doesn't seem so long ago
that I looked at you from here.

ROB
Hi.

LAURA
I knew there was a reason I wore a
skirt today.

Laura reaches down and unzips his pants, as they keep kissing.

ROB

You know, with Ray...

LAURA

Oh, Rob, we're not going to go through
that again.

ROB
No, no.	It's not... are you still
on the pill?

LAURA
Yes, of course.	There's nothing to
worry about.

ROB

I didn't mean that.	I mean... was
 
that all you used?

Laura looks at him, motionless, then begins to cry.

ROB
Look, we can do other things.

LAURA
I lived with you.	You were my partner
just a few weeks ago and now you're
worried I might kill you, and you're
entitled to worry.	Isn't that a

terrible thing?	Isn't that sad?

She rolls off of him into her seat. They sit there in silence, watching the rain run down the windshield.

CUT TO:

ROB IN HIS CHAIR

Rob to camera.

ROB

Later, I wonder if I was really
worried about where Ian has been.	I
have no idea where he's been, and

that gives me every right to insist
on protection.	But in truth, it was
the power that interested me more
than the fear.	I wanted to hurt
her, on this day of all days, just

because it's the first time since
she's left that I've been able to.

INT. BAR - LATER

Rob and Laura lean back in a booth, facing each other. We get that feeling that not another word has been spoken since we last saw them.

ROB

Laura...

LAURA
I'm too tired not to go out with
you.

Rob leans forward.

ROB
So if you had a bit more energy we'd
stay split.	But things being how
they are, what with you wiped out,
you'd like us to get back together.

LAURA

(nodding)
Everything's too hard.	Maybe another
time I would have the guts to be on
 
my own, but not now I don't.

ROB
What about Ian?

LAURA
Ray's a disaster.	I don't know what
that was all about, except that
sometimes you need someone to lob
into the middle of a bad relationship
like a hand grenade, I guess, and
blow it all apart.

ROB

Mission accomplished.

LAURA

I know it's not very romantic, but
there will be romance again at some

stage, I'm sure.	I just... I need
you, Rob.	That's it.	And we know
each other and we care for each other,

and you've made it clear that you
want me back, so...

She looks up at him.

LAURA
Let's go home.	Okay?

ROB
Okay.

CUT TO:

ROB IN HIS CHAIR

Rob to camera.

ROB
But wouldn't you know it?	Suddenly
I feel panicky, and sick, and I want

to run around and sleep with female
recording artists...

CUT TO:

INT. ROB AND LAURA'S APARTMENT - MORNING

Post-lovemaking.	Rob and Laura lie on their backs.

ROB

C'mon.	I want to know.

LAURA
Want to know what, exactly?

ROB
What it was like.
 
LAURA
It was like sex.	What else could it

be like?

ROB
Was it like good sex or was it like
bad sex?

LAURA

What's the difference?

ROB

You know the difference.

LAURA
Look, we're okay now.	We just had a
nice time.	Let's leave it at that.

ROB

Okay, that's cool, okay.	But the
nice time we just had... was it nicer,
as nice, or less nice than the nice

times you were having a couple of
weeks ago?

Laura is silent.

ROB
Oh, c'mon, Laura.	Just say something.
Lie, if you want.	It'd stop me asking
you questions and it'd make me feel
better.

LAURA

Well I was gonna lie and now I can't,
because you'd know I was lying.

ROB
Well why the fuck would you want to
lie, anyway?

LAURA

To make you feel better.

ROB
Oh, great...

Rob begins to get out of bed. She grabs his hand and pulls him back down.

LAURA
Look, Rob.	If great sex was as
important as you think it is, and if
I was having great sex with him,
then we wouldn't be lying here now.
And that is my last word on the
subject, okay?

ROB

Okay.
 
She pulls him close and they lie there, the matter seemingly settled.

LAURA
I wish your penis was as big as his,
though.

He turns slowly to her. A giggle from her turns into a laugh, then a howl, a roar --

EXT. LAKEFRONT - TWILIGHT

Rob and Laura walk the cement breakfront.

LAURA
... Like Mexico.	Or Jamaica.	Or
New York, even.

ROB
Hey, great idea.	What I'll do is,
tomorrow I'll get a hold of a box

full of mint Elvis Presley 78s on
the Sub label, and I'll pay for it
that way.

LAURA

I'll pay for you.	Even though you
owe me money.	We have to do something
with the money I earn.	I need to.
I deserve it.	You can just think of
it as winning the lottery.

ROB

Fantastic.	The Girlfriend Lottery.

LAURA

Money does not matter.	I do not
care how much you earn.	I'd just
like you to be a little happier in
your work, but beyond that you can
do what you like.

ROB

But it wasn't supposed to be like
this.	When I met you we were the
same people and now we're not, and...

LAURA

How?	How were we the same people?

ROB

Well, you were the kind of person
who came to the Artful Dodger and I
was the kind of person who deejayed
at the Artful Dodger.	You wore jeans
and T-shirts, and so did I.	And I

still do, and you don't.

LAURA
 
Because I'm not allowed to.	I still
do, after work.	So, what?	Should

we just break up?	Is that what you're
saying?	Because if you are, I'm
going to run out of patience.

ROB

No, but...

LAURA
But what?

ROB
But why doesn't it matter that we're
not the same people we used to be?

LAURA

You haven't changed so much as a
pair of socks in the years I've known

you.	If we've grown apart, then I'm
the one who's done the growing, and
all I've done is change jobs.

ROB

And hairstyles and clothes and
attitude and friends and...

LAURA
I can't go to work with my hair dyed

pink.	And I can afford to go shopping

more now, and I've met a couple people
I like over the last year or so.

ROB

You're tougher.

LAURA

More confident, maybe.

ROB
Harder.

LAURA
Less neurotic.	Are you intending to
stay the same for the rest of your
life?

ROB
I'm alright.

LAURA
Yeah, you're alright.	But you're
certainly not happy.	So what happens
if you get happy?	And yes I know
that's the title of an Elvis Costello
album, I use the reference
deliberately to catch your attention.

Should we split up because I'm used
to you being miserable?	What happens
if you, I don't know, start you're
 
own record label, and it's a success?
Time for a new girlfriend?

ROB

You're being stupid.

LAURA

How?	What would be the difference
between you having a record label
and me going from legal aid to private
practice?

Rob is silent.

LAURA
All I'm saying is, you have to allow
for things to happen to people, most

of all to yourself.	Otherwise, what's
the use?

ROB
No use.

INT./EXT. RECORD STORE - DAY

Rob comes out of the stock room and walks toward the counter where Dick and Barry stare at the tape deck like two concerned doctors, listening to a song that is raw and moody and lyrical -- Minor Threat meets Brian Eno, if that's possible. Rob joins them in contemplation.

ROB

What is this.

DICK
It's Vince and Justin.

ROB
Who's that?

BARRY
The little skate-fuckers.

ROB

No way.

BARRY

Yes way.	It's really...

Rob and Dick look at him, ready to pounce --

BARRY

(pained to say it)
It's really fucking good.

Dick and Barry look to Rob, who continues to just listen...

He takes a deep breath and walks to the front door and out, seemingly with a mission.
 
Vince and Justin are doing noisy skate tricks against the curb across the street. When they see Rob they stop, get ready to flee. He walks across to them. Dick comes out and hovers in the background.

ROB
Your tape.	It's good.

They mumble thanks.

ROB
It's rough.	But it shows promise.
We record a couple of songs right,
in a studio.	I'll take care of the
rest.	I'll put out your record.
Any profits after recouping expenses
get split down the middle, between

us and you guys.

VINCE
Wait a minute.	Island Records charged
U2 a million five against their

overhead for one plane ride.

ROB
We're not there yet, Justin.

VINCE
I'm Vince.

ROB
Whatever.

He begins to move toward the store. Vince and Justin look at each other. Rob gets to the door but stops and turns.

ROB

Hey.	What's the name of your band?

JUSTIN
The Kinky Wizards.

ROB
What?

VINCE
We saw this ad in the personals for
two swingers lookin' for a Renaissance
fair.

ROB
Nice.

VINCE

What's the name of your label?

Rob looks at them. Then at Dick. Then through the window at Barry, inside looking out. Then at his own reflection in the window. Then back at them.
 
ROB
Broken Records.	Welcome aboard.

Rob walks back inside.	He seems to be shaking a little.

BARRY
What the fuck is that?

ROB

What?

BARRY

I heard you, man.	Don't give me
that "what" shit.	You just told
them that you're gonna put out a
record with them.

ROB
So?	You even said they're good.

BARRY
HELLO.	DO YOU SEE ANYONE ELSE around
here with a band, Mr. Branson?	Mr.
Phil Spector?

Rob waves him off and disappears into the stock room. Laura enters.

LAURA

Hey, Barry.

BARRY

Oh, hi.

LAURA
Where's Rob?

BARRY
The Malcolm McClaren of Clark Street
is in his executive suite.	Do you
have an appointment?

LAURA
What are you talking about?

BARRY
Just that Rob seems to think it would
be wiser to start a record label by
putting out a record with business-

crippling Nazi Youth shoplifters
than with someone he knows in his
bitter jealous heart is a musical

visionary.	That's all.

Laura puts it together, and smiles. She goes to the back and crack the door, finding Rob sitting on a box, thinking.

ROB
Hi.
 
LAURA
Hi.	What are you doing?

ROB

Nothing.

LAURA

Wanna go to dinner?

ROB
Where?

LAURA
At Paul and Miranda's.	Paul from
work.

ROB

Oh.	Well.	We don't really get along.
Paul and I.

LAURA
I know.	But you've never met.	It
just seems like a stone unturned in
your relationship with him.

ROB
Ha.

CUT TO:

ROB IN HIS CHAIR

Rob to camera.

ROB
We're at a point where I can't really
walk away from gauntlets she might

throw down, and so I go.	And wouldn't
you know it, I sort of fall in love
with Paul and Miranda -- with what
they have, and the way they treat
each other, and the way they make me

feel as if I'm the new center of
their world.	I think they're great,
and I want to see them twice a week,
every week, for the rest of my life.
Only right at the end of the evening

do I realize I've been set up.

INT. PAUL AND MIRANDA'S LIVING ROOM - LATER

After dinner. Rob ambles in from the dining room. Laura close behind. He looks through the bookshelves until he finds a meager little grouping of CDs. He moves up to them and scans the titles: Tina Turner. Billy Joel. Kate Bush. Pink Floyd. Simply Red. The Beatles. The Windham Hill Sampler...

PAUL

Lame, right?
 
Rob turns around to see PAUL behind him.

ROB

Oh, I don't know.	The Beatles are
okay.

Paul laughs.

PAUL
We're kinda out of date.

ROB
Hey, to each his own, I say.

PAUL
Maybe we can come by your store and
you can hook us up.

ROB
Sure, sure.	Any time.

LAURA
Better hurry, though, Paul.	Rob
started a record label, so he's gonna
be in the shop less and less.

Rob looks at her.

CUT TO:

INT. ROB AND LAURA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

as they come in the door.

LAURA
..."To each his own!" Unbelievable!
You!	Rob Gordon said that.	You
even sounded like you meant it.

They throw their jackets over a chair. Rob turns on the CD player and "Call Me A Liar" by Palace begins to play.

ROB

(smiling)
You did that deliberately.	You knew
all along I'd like them.	It was a

trick.

LAURA
I tricked you into meeting some people
you'd think were great.	I thought

it would be fun to introduce you to
someone with a Tina Turner album and
then see whether you still felt the
same way.

She moves to Rob and wraps her arms around him. They look deeply at each other. She breaks away from him and walks into the bedroom. He turns off the stereo and follows her.
 
EXT. CLARK STREET - MORNING

Rob walks to work, drinking his coffee. He stops and backs up a few feet, and stares at a poster on a plywood board-up.

"'I SOLD MY MOM'S WHEELCHAIR'/the debut single from The Kinky Wizards/on Broken Records/Record release party July 20 at The Artful Dodger/Featuring the triumphant return of DJ ROB GORDON/"Dance Music For Old People"

Rob scowls, and storms off.

INT. ROB AND LAURA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Rob paces, Laura sits on the couch, smiling.

LAURA
I called Dan Koretzky because he --

ROB
Has Drag City Records, I know, I
know.	You told Dan Koretzky about
this?

LAURA
Yeah, and he said it's a good way to
break out a record.	Especially for
what he said, and I quote, "would be
a highly anticipated event, locally."
He helped me put out a press release.

ROB
WHAT?

LAURA
Just local, of course.

ROB

And the "triumphant return of DJ Rob
Gordon?" "Triumphant?" "Return?"

LAURA
I had that idea when I was living
with Ian and it was such a good idea
that I was annoyed we weren't together
anymore.	It might even be why I

came back.

ROB
You had no right.	Supposing I was
doing something that couldn't be

cancelled?

LAURA
What do you ever do that can't be
cancelled?

ROB

That's not the point.	I mean, what
 
if the single isn't done in time?

LAURA
Barry said its done.

ROB
Barry?	Barry knows about this?

LAURA

Yeah.	His band is playing a set.

Rob wheels on her.

INT. RECORD STORE - DAY

Rob and Barry.

ROB
Like fuck you are.

BARRY
Laura said we could.	If we helped
out with the posters and stuff.	And
we did.	And we are.

ROB

I'll give you 10% of the door if you

don't play.

BARRY
We're getting that anyway.

ROB
What is she doing?	Okay, 20%.

BARRY
No.	We need the gig.

ROB

110%.	That's my final offer.	I'm
not kidding.	That's how much it
means to me not to hear you play.

BARRY

We're not as bad as you think, Rob.

ROB

You couldn't be.	Look, Barry.
There's going to be people from

Laura's work there, people who own
dogs and babies and Tina Turner
albums.	How are you going to cope

with them?

BARRY
We're not called Barrytown anymore,
by the by.	They got sick of the

Barry/Barrytown thing.	We're called
SDM.	Sonic Death Monkey.
 
ROB
Sonic Death Monkey.

BARRY

What do you think?	Dick likes it.

ROB

Barry, you're over thirty years old.
You owe it to yourself and your
friends and to your parents not to
sing in a group called Sonic Death
Monkey.

BARRY

I owe it to myself to go right to
the edge, Rob, and this group does
exactly that.	Over the edge, in

fact.

ROB
You'll be going over the fucking
edge if you come anywhere near me

next Friday night.

BARRY
That's what we want.	Reaction.	And
if Laura's bourgeois lawyer friends

can't take it, then fuck 'em.	Let
'em riot, we can handle it.	We'll
be ready.

Barry wanders off laughing.

CUT TO:

INT. ROB AND LAURA'S APARTMENT - DAY

Rob and Laura.

LAURA
They'll go on early.	Nobody will
even be there yet and I told them

they can't play for more than a half
hour.

ROB
It's no joke.	I'm responsible for
what happens, you know.	Embarrassment
aside, there's a lot of money and

effort in this, at least by my
standards.	I have to put down a
deposit for the room.	I have to pay

the pressing plant for the records,
sleeve them, sticker them --

LAURA
We took care of that.

Rob's brow furrows.
 
LAURA
Barry and Dick and me.	Look in the

bedroom.

Rob goes to the bedroom door and opens it. It's sort of like Christmas: hundreds of Kinky Wizards CD singles, painstakingly packaged and stacked on the bed.

CUT TO:

ROB IN HIS CHAIR

Rob to camera.

ROB
I suddenly feel choked up.	It's not
the money, it's the way she's thought

of everything: one morning I woke up
to find her going through my records,

pulling out things that she remembered
me playing when I deejayed and putting
them into the little carrying cases

that I used to use and put away in a
closet somewhere years ago.	She
knew I needed a kick in the ass.
She also knew how happy I was when I
used to deejay.	From which every

angle I examine it, it still looks
as though she's done all of this
because she loves me.

CUT BACK TO:

INT. ROB AND LAURA'S APARTMENT

Rob turns from the bedroom and goes to Laura, putting his arms around her.

ROB

I'm sorry I've been acting like a
jerk.	I do appreciate what you've
done for me, and I know you've done

it for the best possible reasons,
and I do love you, even though I act
like I don't.

LAURA

That's okay.	You seem pissed off
all the time, though.

ROB
I know.	I don't get it.

CUT TO:

ROB IN HIS CHAIR

Rob to camera.

ROB
 
But if I had to take a wild guess,
I'd say that I'm pissed because I

know I'm stuck with Laura, bound to
her, and I don't like it.	That dreamy
anticipation you have when you're
fifteen or twenty or thirty even,
that the most perfect person in the

world might walk into your store or
office or friend's party at any
moment... That's all gone, I think,
and that's enough to piss anybody
off.	Laura is who I am now, and

it's no good pretending otherwise...

CUT TO:

INT. RECORD STORE - DAY

Rob is standing shelves. A very pretty young woman, CAROLINE, comes through the door and looks around. She sees Rob.

CAROLINE

Excuse me?

Rob looks up and takes her in like a dish in a window.

ROB

May I help you?

CAROLINE
I'm looking for Deejay Rob Gordon.

ROB
Uh.	That's me.

CAROLINE
I'm Caroline Fortis from The Reader.
I want to do a story on you.

ROB
Right.	Why?

CAROLINE
Well, I used to go to the Dodger on
your nights, and I saw you're doing
it again and that your putting out a
record, and it's sort of a then-and-

now story against the backdrop of
the Chicago music scene with the

emphasis on now.

ROB

Oh.	Okay.

CAROLINE
I thought I would ask you a few
questions if that's okay.

ROB

Huh.	You used to come to the club?
 
I shouldn't have let you in.	You
must have only been about sixteen.

Rob realizes what he must be sounding like. He blushes and retreats.

ROB

What I mean is, I didn't mean you
look young.	You don't.	You don't
look old either.	You look just as
old as you are.	A bit younger maybe,
but not a lot.	Not much.	Just right.

CAROLINE

So.	Is now a good time?

Rob looks around: there is absolutely nothing going on in the store. He nods. She pulls out a pad and pencil.

CAROLINE
Right.	So.	You must have an enormous
record collection.

ROB

Yeah.	I could show it to you if you
want to come over and see it.

He winces immediately.

CAROLINE
Yeah, well... Let's see... What are
you're all-time top five records?

ROB

Pardon me?

CAROLINE

Your desert island top-five.

ROB
Oh boy... In the club, or at home?

CAROLINE
Is there a difference?

ROB
(a little too shrill)
OF COURSE... Well yeah, a bit. "Sin
City" by the Flying Burrito Brothers

is an all-time top five, but I
wouldn't play it at the club.	It's

a	country-rock ballad. Everybody'd go home.

CAROLINE
Nevermind.	Any five.	So four more.

ROB
What do you mean, four more?
 
CAROLINE
Well if one of them is this "Sin

City" thing --

ROB
Can I go home and work this out and
let you know?	In a week or so?

CAROLINE

Look if you can't think of anything,
it doesn't matter.	I'll do one.	My
five favorite from the old days at

the Dodger.

Rob is aghast, humiliated, quietly outraged.

ROB

Oh, I'm sure I can manage something...
"Sin City." "New Rose," by The Damned.

"Hit It and Quit It" by Funkadelic.
"Shipbuilding," Elvis Costello,
Japanese import, no horns, or

different horns, anyway... um...
"Mystery Train" by Elvis Presley...
And... "Spaced Cowboy" by Sly and
the Family Stone.	A bit
controversial, I know, but...

CAROLINE

Fine.	That's great.

ROB

Is that it?

CAROLINE
Well, I wouldn't mind a quick chat,
if you got the time.

ROB

Sure, but is that it for the list?

CAROLINE

That's five.	So.	Why did you decide
to deejay again?

ROB
Well it was a friend's idea, really,
and the record release party seemed
like a good place to do it.	So...

(looking over her pad
at the list)
I should really put a James Brown in

there --

CAROLINE
Nice friend.

ROB
Yeah.
 
CAROLINE
What's his name?

ROB

Who?	Oh.	My friend.	My friend is
Laura.	A girl.	A friend who's a
girl.

CAROLINE

"Music for Old People." What does
that mean?

ROB
Look, I'm sorry about this, but I'd
like "the Upsetter" by Lee "Scratch"
Perry, in there.	Instead of "Sin
City."

She scribbles and writes.

CAROLINE
Okay. "Dance Music For Old People?"

ROB

Oh, you know... a lot of people aren't
too old for clubs but they're too
old for acid jazz and garage and

ambient and all that.	They want to
hear old funk and Stax and New Wave
and Old School Hip Hop and some new
stuff all together and there's nowhere
for them.

CAROLINE

And the new label?	And the Kinky
Wizards?

ROB
Oh, well, the Kinky Wizards are --
you know what?	Why don't I just
make you a tape?

CAROLINE
Would you?	Really?	Wow.	I could
have deejay Rob Gordon play in my
own home.

ROB
Haha.	Right.	It's no problem.	I

love making tapes.

CUT TO:

ROB IN HIS CHAIR

Rob to camera.

ROB
A good compilation tape, like breaking
up, is hard to do and takes ages
 
longer than it might seem.	You gotta
kick off with a killer, to hold the

attention.	Then you have to take it
up a notch, but not blow your wad,
so maybe cool it off a notch, and
you can't put the same artist twice
on the tape, except if some subtle

point or lesson or theme involved,
and even then not the two of them in
a row, and you can't woo somebody
with Joni Mitchell's "Big Yellow
Taxi" and then bash their head off

with something like GBH's "City Baby
Attacked by Rats," and... oh, there
are a lot of rules.	Anyway, I worked
hard at this one.

INT. ROB AND LAURA'S APARTMENT - DAY

Rob sits Indian-style on the floor in front of the stereo.

He has a pad of paper with scrawled titles and cross-outs, and is surrounded by piles of CDs and records.

LAURA
Who's that for?

Rob winces, turns.	He's busted.

ROB
This?	Oh, just that woman who
interviewed me for The Reader.	Carol?

Caroline?	Something like that.

Laura turns and walks out of the room.

INT. RECORD STORE - DAY

Rob is tucked into the corner, on the phone.

ROB
Hi, Caroline... Oh, it's Rob.	Yeah,
listen, I have a new list for you
and -- Oh.	Yes.	Of course...	Well
maybe next week they could print a,
uh, retraction.	Or a correction.
Because the list I have now it really

much more -- right.	Okay.	Anyway,
I have your tape.	That's right.

Shall I mail it to you?	Or... would
you like to have a drink?

CUT TO:

ROB IN HIS CHAIR

Rob to camera.

ROB

How are you not going to fall for
 
someone who wants to interview you?
Now Caroline is all I can think about.

And in the daydreams I imagine every
detail, the entire story of our future
relationship, until suddenly I realize
that there's nothing left to actually,
like, happen.	I've done it all,

lived through it all in my head.	I
know the whole plot, the ending, and
the good parts.	Now I'd have to
watch it all over again in real time,
and where's the fun in that?	And

fucking--when is it all going to
stop?	Am I going to jump from rock
to rock for the rest of my life until
there aren't any rocks left?	Am I
going to bolt every time I get itchy

feet?	Because I get them about once
a quarter, along with the store's

tax bill.	I've been thinking with
my guts since I was fourteen years
old and, frankly speaking, I've come

to the conclusion that my guts have
shit for brains.	You know what's
wrong with Laura, what my problem
is?	What's wrong with Laura is that
I'll never see her for the first or

second or third time.	That's all.
Fuck it.	I'll probably mail the
tape.	Probably.

CUT TO:

INT. NORTH SIDE TAVERN - DAY

Rob sits at a table in the bar, nervous. He watches the door, sits up straight when it opens, and follows someone with his eyes, all the way to his table. She sits. It's Laura.

LAURA
A drinking lunch on a school day.
What a nice surprise.

Rob says nothing.

LAURA

Are you worried about tomorrow night?

ROB
Not really.

He plays with his drink.

LAURA
Are you going to talk to me, or shall
I get my paper out?

ROB

I'm going to talk to you.
 
LAURA

Right.

He plays with his drink some more.

LAURA

What are you going to talk to me
about?

ROB

I'm going to talk to you about whether

you want to get married or not.	To
me.

LAURA
Ha ha ha.	Hoo hoo hoo.

ROB

I mean it.

LAURA

I know.

ROB
Oh, well thanks a fucking bunch.

LAURA
I'm sorry.	But two days ago you
were in love with that girl who
interviewed you for The Reader,
weren't you?

ROB

Not in love, exactly, but...

LAURA

Well forgive me if I don't think of
you as the world's safest bet.

ROB
Would you marry me if I was?

LAURA

No.	Probably not.

ROB

Right.	Okay, then.	Shall we go?

LAURA
Don't sulk.	What brought all this
on?

ROB

I don't know.

LAURA

Very persuasive.

ROB
 
Are you persuadable?

LAURA
No.	I don't think so.	I'm just
curious about how one goes from making
tapes for one person to marriage
proposals to another in two days.

Fair enough?

ROB
Fair enough.

LAURA
So?

ROB
I'm just sick of thinking about it
all the time.

LAURA
About what?

ROB
This stuff.	Love and marriage.	I
want to think about something else.

LAURA

I've changed my mind.	That's the
most romantic thing I've ever heard.
I do.	I will.

ROB

Shut up.	I'm only trying to explain.

LAURA
I mean, maybe you're right.	But
were you really expecting me to say

yes?

ROB
I dunno.	Didn't think about it,
really.	It was the asking that was

the important thing.

LAURA
Well, you've asked.

She leans over and takes his hands in hers, smiles at him.

LAURA
Thank you.

INT. ARTFUL DODGER - NIGHT

TWO TURNTABLES

with the mixer in the middle. "Just Begun" by Jimmy Castor spins on turntable #1. A hand reaches in, and begins to draw the slides down, quieting the music.
 
Rob looks up from behind the deejay table, set up amongst the instruments. The place is packed with people, and everyone seems to be having a great time.

Almost everyone -- Rob sees Barry, who pretends to nod off when Rob catches his eye, and Justin, who looks back at him and mocks a bulimic act. Rob gives him the finger. He sees Laura, and she beams at him. He comes to the front of the stage, and taps a microphone.

ROB
Uh, thanks for uh, coming out tonight.
I hope you have a good time.	And I
hope you like the record.	The one
by the Kinky Wizards.	The record
that we're having this record release
party for.

(hoots from the crowd)
Thanks.	Listen to it first, though.

(laughs)
Okay.	We'll get to that later.
Right now, I'd like to introduce...

(mumbles)
Sonic Death Monkey.

Good-natured applause. Rob steps down and bee-lines to Laura. Barry and his crew mount the stage. Rob takes a big gulp of beer.

ROB
(to Laura)
I'm an idiot.	I should have played

the record first.	This place is
about to get burned down.

LAURA
It's gonna be fine.	These people
are ready for anything.

BARRY
(dubious)
Yeah, well...

Barry stands in front of the mic, surveying the crowd with a smile. He and the band all wear suits and ties.

BARRY

Thanks for the enthusiastic intro,
Rob.	We're not called Sonic Death

Monkey anymore, though, ladies and
gentlemen.	We might be on the verge
of becoming the Atavistics, but we

haven't decided yet.	But tonight,
we are... BARRY JIVE AND THE UPTOWN
FIVE!	ONE TWO THREE --And they launch
into Marvin Gaye's "Got To Give It
Up," almost flawlessly faithful to

the original.	Barry is transformed --
shuffling footwork, a wide smile,
and when the intro winds up, an almost
 
perfect falsetto.	The crowd goes
nuts, filling the floor.	Rob is

stunned, begins to smile.	Laura
takes his hand and leads him out
into the crowd...
