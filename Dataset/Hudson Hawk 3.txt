HAWK AND ANNA'S TABLE

Physically sarcastic, the Waiter brings a tall wine basket with a bottle of ketchup in it. Hawk nabs it.

HAWK

This is bueno.	They had the worst
ketchup in prison.....uh...

ANNA

Prison?

HAWK
I was the Warden?

ANNA

How long were you in?

HAWK

Let's just say, I never saw E.T.

ANNA

Wow, you were "in the joint."
"Doing hard time."	It's funny,
 
but that excites me.	I seem to

have a thing for sinners.

HAWK
I seem to have a thing for sinning.
sinning.	Check please....

WAITER

Ah, anything for dessert?

ANNA

(she shoots)
Yes.	Something to go.

HAWK

(she scores)
I'll bring the ketchup.

INT. ANNA'S HOUSE--NIGHT

The viewer's viewpoint pulls back, past the black canvas bag on a table, to reveal a barefoot Anna is straddling a bare-backed Hawk, demurely and tentatively studying his bruises.

ANNA

What have you been doing?

HAWK
Uh....old badminton injury.

Anna giggles and bends to kiss a bruise. She stops herself and opts for tickling.

HAWK
tickles, ticKleS, TICKLES.

ANNA

(not stopping)
Oh, I'm so sorry...

Roaring with laughter, they capsize onto the floor. Hawk slithers around to devour her toes. Anna closes her eyes and arches her back.....

She opens her eyes and sees a large crucifix staring right at her. With a gasp, she rolls away from Hawk and stands up, trying to brush off her sins.

ANNA

I'm sorry.	I can't.	I....
 
HAWK

(softly approaching)
Hey now, outside of a very
friendly dog this morning, it's
been a slow decade.	I don't make
love every ten years, I get a
little cranky.

ANNA

It's also been a long time for
me.	I--

Their heads fuse for a semi-classic screen kiss until THE CRUCIFIX LIGHTS UP AND BEGINS SHOUTING IN ITALIAN.

HAWK
Catholic girls are scary...

ANNA

Somebody robbed the Vatican.

HAWK

Oh.	No.

Anna slides on her shoes and makes a hasty retreat. She bumps into the canvas bag. The Codex slides out. They both catch it in mid-air. Anna's eyes pop. She wrenches the Codex away and kicks. Hawk pulls her into a compassionate back-against-his-stomach hug. The Codex falls to the floor unharmed.

HAWK

It's not what you think.	Okay,
maybe it is....

ANNA

You really went and did it.	With
one day, not even a day, of
planning, you did it.	Nobody
does it better, Hudson.	You
started the week stealing the
Sforza and you ended it swiping

the Codex.

HAWK

Wha--

ANNA
What are your plans for the
weekend?	Hoisting away the
Colosseum?	Tell me, did the
devil make you do it or did
 
Darwin and Minerva Mayflower?

EXT. A CAR OUTSIDE OF ANNA'S PLACE--NIGHT

Crammed together in the front seat, Snickers, Almond Joy, and Butterfinger are watching the shadows of Hawk and Anna up in the window. Snickers snaps a cartridge into a gun while Butterfinger attacks a goo-ey pastry.

SNICKERS

What's going on in there?

BUTTERFINGER

Do you want me to rape them?

(throwing pastry down)
Dunkin does it better.

SNICKERS

Just read, Butterfinger.

Butterfinger pulls up the book on Da Vinci that Anna wrote and starts reading like a schoolboy.

BUTTERFINGER

"Da Vinci had fears about his
more dangerous designs, so he
created a shorthand code in
reverse script..."

ALMOND JOY

To yourself!.....What are they
doing?	In twenty seconds, we go
in.

INT. ANNA'S PLACE

Foam shoots out over the coffee. Hawk smiles down at it as Anna works a cappuccino machine.

ANNA
For two years, I've been tracking
the Mayflowers' peculiar interest
in three Da Vinci pieces.	Their
Sforza replica was as fake as
the "gas leak" that supposedly
destroyed it.

HAWK

Does everyone in the world know
more than me?	Jesus, I'm just
some guy who happens to be good
 
at swiping stuff.....Lifted a

piece of licorice when I was one
and a half.	Who knew it would
lead... They even got the CIA
involved!

ANNA

The C.I. what?	God, no...

HAWK
(raising his cup)
Ooh, I guess I do know something
Here's looking at you, kid...

THE CAR OUTSIDE

The agents burst from the car, guns raised.

ALMOND JOY

Now.

ANNA'S HOUSE

Hawk sips the cappuccino.	His face immediately contracts.

HAWK

This doesn't taste like
cappuccino.

ANNA

Oh, I must have put too much
ethyl-chloride in it.

Anna throws a pillow on the ground and holds out her hand. Hawk collapses. His coffee cup lands perfectly in Anna's outstretched hand and his head lands perfectly on the pillow.

The candy bars bash the door open, guns raised.

ANNA

Why didn't you tell me at the restaurant that he had hit the Vatican tonight. My people will not be happy. I want to see Kaplan.

ALMOND JOY

That's not overly possible.	He...

BUTTERFINGER

But guys, remember, he's in the
castle at Vinci....
 

Snickers and Almond Joy grimace into fake smiles.

EXT. THE CASTLE--NIGHT

A helicopter thunders up to the awesome castle from the opening Da Vinci sequence.

INT. HELICOPTER

Anna pets the head of Hawk on her lap.	She is pondering.

INT. A MYSTERIOUS DARK ROOM--NIGHT

A sparse circle of light houses a chair and a pacing Kaplan.

Snickers and Butterfinger flop Hawk onto the lit chair.

Kit Kat is dressed exactly like Anna. She reacts as she comes into the light. Kaplan takes the Codex from her.

KAPLAN
Way to go, Anna.

ANNA

When the Mayflowers find out we
have the Codex, they're going to
want to make a deal...

KAPLAN

(gung-ho lying)
And then we'll arrest those
greedy pigs... Is that it?

Hawk stirs.	The viewer gets his woozy P.O.V.

ANNA

Actually George, it's not it.
What are we doing in this castle?
I happen to know the Mayflowers
bought this castle last year when

they found out Da Vinci used to
do...

The lights in the room come on to the sound of holy Da Vinci theme, revealing an almost perfect refurbishing of the exact same workshop Da Vinci toiled in in the opening.

KAPLAN

(trying to be solemn)
 

It's the site of their new museum and we're taking it over. Operation Deflower Mayflower is going full speed ahead.

ANNA

(taking it in)
Oh Lord.... the only reason I ask is
that Hudson, uh, Mr. Hawk, Hawkins,
had some "neat" things to say about
Darwin, Minerva, and you.
Basically that you're part of the
same car pool.

KAPLAN

Anna.	Anna.	Anna.	If that were
true, Almond Joy would have
handed you your heart right
after you handed me the Codex.
Now, get some sleep.	Kit Kat...

Kit Kat in drag spookily moves inches away from Anna.

ANNA

Cat got his tongue?

KAPLAN

Actually he never told us what it
was.

Kit Kat smiles, revealing the fact he has no tongue.

ANNA

How sweet.	I trust you will see
Hudson Hawk is given to the proper
authorities.	I recommend
leniency...

SNICKERS

(holding in a laugh)
Oh, I think we all do.

Hawk gives her a look of honesty and pain that causes Anna to guiltily gulp as she heads out with the mimicking Kit Kat.

SNICKERS

Do you think she has any idea that
Operation Deflower Mayflower is as
bogus as Kit Kat's tits?

KAPLAN
 
I don't think so, although bringing

her to the castle gave her a big,
juicy hint.

ALMOND JOY

With all due respect to that great
blouse, why didn't I cut out her
heart?

KAPLAN
Close call, but she's our only way
of keeping tabs on that damn
mysterious Vatican organization.
Hawk, it's time to go to the
principal's office....

EXT. OUTSIDE THE CASTLE--NIGHT

Moving into the chopper, Anna glimpses, Bunny, the obnoxious dog, in a Mayflower logo dog tag, taking a leak on some bushes. She fakes a yawn to the like dressed Kit Kat who fakes one back.

INT. THE G. MACHINE ROOM--NIGHT

Kaplan, Hawk, and the other agents march into the mammoth room of the opening scene. In the place of where one remembers the gold machine are undulating sheets, beneath which are unassembled parts of the machine.

Inside, a ball goes whizzing out of a tennis ball machine. In tennis gear and goggles, Darwin Mayflower thwacks it against the wall of (now faded) frescos.

Also in tennis threads, Minerva is laying on a chaise lounge holding a gadget in her hand.

DARWIN

Seven!

Minerva turns the gadget up to SEVEN and presses a button. Another tennis ball shoots out, a little faster. Darwin batters it. The ball ricochets into the forehead of an "amused" Alfred who is retrieving balls in sweat pants.

ALFRED

Jolly.	Good.	Shot.	Sir.

MINERVA

Ooh, it's Hudson Hawk, you cease
to amaze me, convict.	You are a
 
terrible cat burglar!

DARWIN

Haven't you ever seen, like David
Niven?	You know tiptoe in, tiptoe
out.

MINERVA

Like a "cat", one could say.

HAWK

Shucks, I'll just take it back.

Hawk reaches for the Codex. Kaplan pulls it over to Darwin, who pulls up his goggles and fondles the ancient binding. Taking a knife from Kaplan, he begins to slit it open.

MINERVA

(bouncing up)
No, let me!

DARWIN
(pout)
I don't care.

Hawk looks away to the billowing sheets and the strange machine parts behind them.

Minerva slits the bindings and tugs out another geometri-cally perverted crystal.

HAWK

Another piece of the puzzle for
the Da Vinci Alchemy project.

Kaplan, Darwin, and Minerva look up to Hawk, then to each other, all start to speak, then all stop.

This quandary is deferred by the entrance of the twin Flunkies.

DARWIN

Oh, you.	There's nothing more I
hate than failure.	All you had to
do was follow the Hawk, it's not
like I said "Teach our nation's
children how to read."

Hawk uses the distraction to amble toward the sheets.

DARWIN
 
I guess we're just going to have

to kill 'em...

Shockingly swift, Minerva pulls a small gun from beneath her tennis dress and blasts a burning hole between each set of Flunky eyes, splattering them to the ground.

DARWIN

God Minerva, I was kidding.

A SHOCKED HAWK

quickly turns from the blithe carnage and pulls up a sheet. He reveals the familiar Gold Machine Demonhead.

THE MAYFLOWERS

reverberate off each other with laughter. Bloodstained, Kaplan and Almond Joy exchange an eye bulge. Minerva's smile disappears as she sees Hawk by the sheets.

MINERVA

Get away from there, convict!

HAWK

Just browsing.	Don't touch me....

Snickers touches him.	Hawk smashes him in the jaw.
Snickers rears back to reciprocate....

DARWIN

Don't hurt him!	We need him for
the final job!

Snickers stops himself, snarling in frustration. Hawk is suddenly the happiest man he's been in Italy.

HAWK

Oh weeeeelly, don't hurt me?	Even
if I do this....

Hawk pulls Snickers' glasses off and stamps them.

HAWK

And this....

Hawk knees Butterfinger in the stomach.

HAWK

Surely this must offend....

Hawk body-block-dominoes Butterfinger and Snickers to the
 
ground.	Kaplan and Almond Joy aim their guns.

KAPLAN

That's it!

Playfully lifting his shirt, Hawk grabs Minerva and manually swivels her hips to the beat of his.

HAWK

Things are getting a little loose
at the Da Vinci workshop tonight.
"Put your left leg in, take your
right foot out."	May I call you
Minnie....

Hawk mambos to Alfred who rifles his blade up to Hawk's crotch. Hawk stops dancing.

DARWIN

Come to think of it there is a part of your body that you won't need for your next job...

HAWK

Hey, guys, I've always wanted to sing like Franki Valli and the other seasons, but come on....

Alfred moves the blade a little upward.	Hawk a-a-ghs.

MINERVA

Big girls don't cry-I-eye.

HAWK

Two minutes, 35 seconds.	Damnit,
I'm involved in this thing, so I
just wanna know what this thing is.
I wanna be treated as an adult.

DARWIN

That's fair.	Tomorrow.	Back in
Rome.	Now go to your room.

Alfred strategically Vulcans Hawk on the neck.	He falls.

INT. DARK CONFESSION BOOTH--MORNING

The lips of Anna come into light.

ANNA

Forgive me Father for I have
sinned.	It's been 1200 hours
 
since my last confession.

INT. THE CARDINAL'S SIDE OF THE CONFESSION BOOTH

The cardinal suppresses a yawn.

CARDINAL

Hit me with your best shot.

ANNA (O.S.)
I betrayed a man.	A good man.	An
innocent man.	A thief.

CARDINAL

Anna, what are you trying to say...

ANNA'S DARKENED LIPS

ANNA

He came into a world where crime
is a legitimate business tactic
and a legitimate government
procedure.	But he knew Right and
Wrong.	Oh, and we kind of messed
around...

THE CARDINAL

freaks and goes into some Italian gibberish before...

CARDINAL

"Messed around" messed around?	I
know-- I don't want to know.	First
base?	Second Base?	Stop me when
I'm getting warm...

ANNA (O.S.)

A little petting is not the issue!

CARDINAL

Sorry.	Seventeen Hail Marys and
five minutes outside.

INT. OUTSIDE THE CONFESSION BOOTH--MORNING

The Cardinal emerges and stands by Anna's confessional curtains.

CARDINAL

So let me get this straight,
sister, you're saying Hudson Hawk
is not willingly working for the
 
Mayflowers but Kaplan and the

Candy Bars are?

Anna moves out of the confessional curtains, wearing a FULL NUN HABIT for she is a Nun. The gaspingly beautiful church unfolds as they walk.

ANNA

You got it. Operation Deflower Mayflower is a bad joke and I'm the punchline. I thought we were using the CIA to help us to get Mayflower, but really the CIA was using me to keep us away from Mayflower.

CARDINAL
Oh, why couldn't I be the Cardinal
in charge of catering.... If the

Mayflowers get the three sections of Da Vinci's crystal and his instructions for the gold machine-- Aie-yi--Do we got anything? What of Alex, Hawk's friend, where is his loyalty?

ANNA

I'm going to find out.

CARDINAL

I'm sorry for losing it back there, but you must remember, sister, you have vows to God as well as a mission to the world.

ANNA

I know, I know, your Eminence, just say "God go with me."

CARDINAL

God go with you, sister.

Anna puts on the coolest pair of sunglasses, deliciously

contrasting with her habit.	She moves off....

INT. ROME CONFERENCE ROOM--DAY

Beneath the wacky portrait, Darwin circles the board-member filled conference table as Minerva smooches Bunny. Everyone watches Alfred place a bar of Gold and of Lead in the hands of a blindfolded Hawk at the middle of the M.

DARWIN
 
So, Captain Hawk, in one of your

paws you got a gold bar worth
about 8 thou.	In the autre, you
got lead that won't get you
gelato.

MINERVA

Surely a master-thief like you can
tell the difference.

HAWK

("What's my Line")
That's two down to Kitty
Carlisle...

Hawk "weighs" the two bars in his hands--digs with his fingernails. He rips off the blindfold in subdued frustration. As Minerva speaks, she unconsciously molests Alfred.

MINERVA

Cool, isn't it?	Weight, feel,
mal1eability, they're all but
identical.	On the periodic chart
of elements, they're but one
proton apart.	Great minds worked
for centuries to turn worthless
into priceless.

HAWK

Alchemy.

DARWIN

(casually goosing Alfred)
Alchemy!	Is the business term of
the 90's, my man!	Minerva read
about it in an airline magazine
about four years ago.	I dumped
some lira into research... Shazam,
we come across a diary by one of
Da Vinci's apprentices detailing
La Machine de Oro, the gold machine

for those at home, and the rest is
about to become history.	Money
isn't everything, gold is.	Fuck
blue chip stocks!	Fuck T-bills!
Fuck Junk Bonds!	I got the real
deal!	Money will always be paper
but gold will always be gold!

MINERVA

Market crashes.	Bomb drops.
 
Greenhouse effect affects.	We'll

still be the richest, most powerful
people in the world.	In 1992,
Europe is coming together to become
one business superpower.	It's one
party we'd love to poop.

DARWIN

Well, that said, the last ingredient in the recipe is in, get this, you're gonna die, the Kremlin.

HAWK

Sure. The Kremlin. Makes sense. The Kremlin. Why not? Listen, this is all too Indiana Jones and the Lost City of King Tut for me, man. Throw me in jail and go ahead, just try and throw Alex...

MINERVA

Jail, you asshole!	Our foot
soldiers will blow your brains
out!	Bunny, Ball-Ball!

Minerva angrily throws the dog off her lap and whips a tennis ball into its mouth.

DARWIN
I'll torture you so slowly you'll
think it's a career!	I'll kill
your family, your friends, and the
bitch you took to the Prom!

HAWK
You want an address on that last
one?

Bunny barks up at Hawk in anger.

HAWK
Bunny, not you too?

MINERVA

You've got a dilemma, tiger.	I
think I know what's going to help
you solve it.

Alfred quickly latches on the state-of-the-art handcuffs and the blindfold. The viewer's viewpoint stays on a writhing Hawk.
 
HAWK

I'll kill all you.	Even the old
lady.


Hawk kicks back on the table, "jump ropes" the cuffs, then picks the lock with his teeth. Hawk rips off the blindfold to see that the entire room is empty except for Alex, standing at the other end, in an incongruous Italian leather coat.

ALEX

I hated cigarettes until I saw my
first No Smoking sign.	Keep off
the Grass?	Let's play Soccer.

Only law I cared about was
friendship.	Broke that one too,
didn't I?	This Gates-Mario
Brothers-CIA-Mayflower-Da Vinci
thing seemed like a sweet deal.
Visit foreign lands, take their
treasures.	I don't know, I thought
you'd get into it.	It's better
than playing darts with M.B.A.'s at
the bar.	I didn't know it was
going to be like this.	Them using
me to use you... I'm sorry, there's
only one way out of this and it's
gonna hurt me more than it's gonna
hurt you.

Alex pulls out a gun from his jacket and clicks it in.

EXT. FAMILIAR PIAZZA--DAY

The piazza from the fascist E.U.R. building are bustling with office workers laughing, smoking, and hustling. Darwin, Minerva and Kaplan are a solid troika in the center of the steps. The other agents stroll in the periphery....

KAPLAN

I just don't think it was a
smoking hot idea to leave them up
there alone.

MINERVA

Don't worry George, this is the
reason we put the old diabetic
guinea on the payroll to begin
with.	To keep Hawk in line.
They'll talk about "being buddies"
 
and "chugging brewskis."

DARWIN

(raising glass)
You gotta love male bonding.

As Darwin slaps Kaplan on the back, behind them, Hawk and Alex come crashing out of the windowed doors of the building.

KAPLAN
You were saying...

Moving to the edge of the stairs, Hawk and Alex, latter holding his gun, sprout up from their own debris and continue savagely brawling. The wigging out passers-by give them space.

HAWK

You bastard!	You fucked my
freedom for a lousy job!

Alex trembles, going into a diabetic seizure. He shakily raises his gun.

ALEX

Hawk... I'm so sorry...

Hawk roars forward like a bull and helmets Alex. They roll together down the massive staircase past Darwin, Minerva, and the CIA who react with "This can't be happening" catatonia.

Two SHOTS go off as Hawk and Alex crash to the bottom of the staircase. Hawk rises up in a daze to see Alex on the ground with two bloody bullet holes.

HAWK

No.....Alex!	Wake up, you can't
go out like this.

Hawk falls to his knees as Snickers hustles toward him.
Suddenly, sirens are heard as a police van pulls up.

Snickers stops.

Four policemen blast from the back of the van. One holds back the crowd. One strenuously pulls Hawk into the van. The other two drag in Alex.

The villains look to each other for non-existent guidance as the van pulls away.

MINERVA
 
Plan B, anyone...

Using initiative, Snickers hops on a Vespa and roars off
after them.	The van can be seen swerving off.....

AROUND A CORNER

where it bolts up into a much larger truck marked VATICAN SOUVENIRS. TWO SEEMINGLY-INNOCENT-BYSTANDER PRIESTS break demeanor to flop up the wheel ramps, slam close the back of the truck, lock it shut, and continue on their solemn way.

The TRUCK BELLOWS off as the Vespa spins around the corner. Snickers brakes and looks around for the police van. He hits his handle with frustration.

EXT. BEAUTIFUL ROME OVERVIEW

Out of her habit but still in her incredible sunglasses, Anna looks out to a lovely view of Italy. The Vatican Truck pulls up behind her. A giddy, blood-stained Alex and a not-so-giddy Hawk bound out of the back. Alex excitedly gives himself an insulin shot.

ANNA

Oh thank God, you're dead...

ALEX
It was so beautiful!	When the
blanks went off, they...

Hawk's fist whooshes into frame and blasts Alex's jaw.

HAWK
You bastard.	You fucked my
freedom for a lousy job.

ALEX

But I said I was sorry....

HAWK

No sweat, Alex, you only made the
biggest mistake of my life.	What
was your per-diem?

ALEX

Don't act like you've never committed
a crime before, Hawkins?	I know, I
made call, when Anna tracked me down I...

ANNA
 
Hudson, don't you understand...

HAWK

And you, Dr. Cappucino, you're lucky I don't hit women, assuming you are a woman. I'm not taking anything for granted anymore.

ANNA

I-work-for-a-covert-Vatican-humanitarian-organization. The-CIA-made-a-fool-of-me. I-care-for-you...

HAWK

Oh.	Well, what's this?

Hawk pulls out the Demon Head that was in the Mayflower Museum from out of his pocket. Anna turns white.

ANNA

Where did you get this?

HAWK
You know, the place where you gave
the bad guys the Codex.... the
Mayflower Museum.

ANNA

It's from the machine.	All they
need is the crystal to run it and

they have 2/3 of it already.	We
can't let that happen.

ALEX

You're saying you want us to beat
them to the crystal and save the
world from financial disarray.

ANNA

Something like that.

ALEX

(pulling out plane
tix)
Well, forget about it.	Hawk and I
are going to Rio.	We're hurt,
we're tired, and a hero ain't
nothing but a sandwich.	Right,
buddy?...

ANNA

Hudson, God's given you a gift for
 
cat burglary, you can t just...

HAWK

You better believe I can.	I'm
sick of people telling me what I
have to do.

ANNA

It's that kind of selfish attitude
that...

HAWK

Selfish attitude?	I'm just some
guy who wants a little nap and a
cappuccino for when he wakes up,

not too much foam...

ANNA

You re not "some guy" anymore,
Hudson.	Right now, you're the
only guy.	Without your help, I....

Anna looks to Hawk with a choked-up expression. The weight of the world on his shoulders, Hawk turns away to a lovely view, his mind painfully raging and swirling toward peaceful clarity.

HAWK

The world is beautiful.	Every day
in prison I made sure to remember

that.	It's only when I actually
got out that I forgot.	If I was
sane, I'd be on that plane to Rio.
But being beaten and abused to
fulfill some corporation's
perverted vision does something to
your mental health.	The world is
beautiful and I'm tired of being
fucked.
(turning around)
It's Darwin and Minerva's turn to
bite the pillow...

Anna involuntarily does the sign of the cross. Alex goodnaturedly does a jerking off motion.

ANNA

That was beautiful.

ALEX

I laughed, I cried.
 

Shaking his head, Hawk swipes the plane tickets from Alex.

HAWK
Rio, Alex?	After all they've
done to...Hey, these tickets are
for Moscow!

ALEX

(knowing smile)
Damn travel agency.	That Kremlin
thing is in Moscow, isn't it?

A proud Hawk slaps Alex on the back as some passing ITALIAN LOCALS stop to stare, horrified, at Alex's bullet holes. Anna sweetly intervenes.

ANNA

Ketchup.	Stupido Americani...

The locals give off a slightly dazed "A-a-h" and move off.

INT. THE CONFERENCE ROOM--DAY

Wind blows through the shattered conference room window. Snickers is banging on his computer apparatus at the table with the Mayflowers and the other agents.

KAPLAN
We're all family now.	My team
has done a lot of rougher things
than steal the model of a
helicopter.

SNICKERS
We're going to whack this place
so fast we'll have time to shop
for American imports.

Darwin and Minerva politely smile and then turn away to each other with knowing looks. The computer screen shows the familiar image of the Kremlin building that turns into a complex look at interiors the viewer will later see.

ALMOND JOY

Lucky for us, the Da Vinci is
located in a wing of the Kremlin
that they used to throw the Miss
Ukraine pageant and stuff.	It'll
have the least number of guards....
 
KAPLAN

As for our plan of action,
anybody'd be insane to go in
from the ground floor...

INT. A VAN-BUS--NIGHT

A head-rubbing Hawk and a stomach rubbing Alex kneel on the floor of a moving van, over a barely legible drawing of what was so neatly delineated on the CIA computer. Both guys are dressed as priests and are chewing gum.

ALEX

We're going in from the ground
floor.

HAWK

Geez, this Art Treasures Room
looks like a burnt diaphragm.

Hawk laughs and pops up into the passenger seat. Anna is revealed to be driving in her habit. Hawk gives her a kiss.

HAWK

Hey, don't take your disguise so
seriously.

ANNA
Uh, yeah.	Guess I'm a wee bit
nervous.	I'm sorry I could only
score clergy passports.

HAWK

Fits my new image.	A thief for
the masses.	This is one job I'm
not going to feel guilty about
enjoying.	Gum.

Hawk, Alex, and Anna all spit out their gum into a bag Hawk holds.

ALEX

The security's actually not that
severe.

ANNA

It doesn't have to be.	Everybody
knows that if you mess with the
Kremlin, you'll end up in a
Siberian gulag eating your own
fingernails.
 

Hawk takes in some views of Moscow that remind one of Budapest.

HAWK

Shwoof, that makes me feel better.
I can't believe this is the Iron
Curtain.	All the guy at Airport
customs wanted to know was "Who
Shot J.R.?"

ALEX

You sound disappointed.

HAWK

Yeah, I mean, come on, going
through the Iron Curtain is
supposed to be crawling
underneath barbed wire, it's
supposed to be strangling a
guard...

THE VAN

passes a textbook shot of the Kremlin in the distance.

HAWK (V.O.)

It's supposed to be parachuting
in the moonlight....

EXT. THE TOP OF THE KREMLIN--NIGHT

Kaplan, Snickers, Almond Joy, and Butterfinger slam down upon the roof of the Kremlin and discard their parachutes.

Snickers opens up his computer screen, upon which is the image-map of the Kremlin with a flashing blue light at the top of the building and a flashing green one inside.

SNICKERS
We are the blue light.	The green
light is where the Art Treasures
room is.

KAPLAN

Let's go make a purple light.
Where's Kit Kat?

EXT. THE KREMLIN GROUNDS

Dressed in cat burglar black and all chewing gum, Hawk,
 

Alex, and Anna crawl across the Kremlin grounds. They scope out a shabby Delivery Entrance.

ALEX
Delivery Entrance.	Low Security.

ANNA

Gum.

All three spit out their gum into Hawk's bag.

HAWK

Count of three?

ALEX

Why not just go now?

HAWK

Okay.

The Trio rush for the door.

THE KREMLIN ROOF

SOVIET GUARD ONE comes out on the roof to light a cig-arette. He looks in the distance to the motivating CIA team. Suddenly a card floats down into his hand.

It reads:	WILLIAM TELL.	ADAM'S APPLE.	GET IT?

The not-getting-it Guard looks up from the card as a grinning Kit Kat parachutes behind him. The Guard swerves around and Kit Kat savagely skewers him with a crossbow shot to his Adam's apple.

THE DELIVERY ENTRANCE

Hawk, Anna, and Alex race to the door, the latter bashes it...

INT. GRUNGY WHITE FOYER

open and sets off an annoying hammer-against-bell alarm. Alex all-fours beneath the alarm. Hawk does a Michael Jordan vault off Alex's back and slam dunks A MASSIVE BALL OF USED-GUM, pulled from his bag, between the hammer and the bell, cutting off the sound. They rush ahead.

EXT. THE KREMLIN ROOF

The agents are trotting across the roof when a phone on
 
Snickers' apparatus rings.	Kaplan answers it.

KAPLAN

Everything's going fine, Minerva,
thanks for asking...

INT. NONDESCRIPT HALLWAY

Minerva chats on a cellular moving down a hallway, with Darwin, who is holding in his laughter as if this was a great crank.

MINERVA

I say who needs this Hudson Hawk
anyway....

INT. A GRAND BALLROOM

The good guys scurry upon the second level of an epic and gorgeous ballroom. Two lush staircases lead up from the floor. From behind a pillar, the gang checks out the activity below.

A tablecloth is being wrangled over a large table at

the opposite end of the ballroom by SERVANTS. Threaten-ing SOVIET SOLDIERS maneuver on the floor.

HAWK

(Wizard of Oz)
Oh-Eee-Oh-A-Whoa-Oh.

They then make a mad scuffle across their side of the second level, hunkering down by the level railing.

As they move into another wing hallway, the viewer's viewpoint moves back down to the ballroom floor to see a gloating DARWIN AND MINERVA ENTER, the latter still on the phone.

MINERVA

Everybody here, in Rome, wishes
you tinsel boxes of love...

The servants move away from the tablecloth and the table, revealing that it is shaped like an M. A GROUP OF SERIOUS SOVIET V.I.P.'s come out to join the Mayflowers at the table.

THE ROOF

Kaplan hangs up the phone.
 
KAPLAN

Lazy, rich, condescending bitch.

The team moves up to the rooftop doorway where Kit Kat is. He holds up an "About Time" card. The agents laugh and greet them.

INT. A VERY LONG, ENIGMATIC HALLWAY

Hawk, Alex, and Anna pass through a set of windowed double doors into a very long hallway that leads into a pitch darkness. A MURAL OF A HAPPY, ARM-STRETCHED LENIN looms above the doors. They give it a a quick glance before pulling out screwdrivers and wire hangers.

ALEX
Eighth room down, babe...

ANNA

Guards come exactly every three
minutes....

HAWK
Three.	Oh.	Oh.	"Side by Side."

Our trio charges down the hallway.

HAWK

"Oh, we ain't got a barrel of
money.

ALEX

"Maybe we're ragged and funny."

They reach a MASSIVE SPOOKY DOOR WITH AN ODD, ANCIENT LOCK. They go to work on it. Not losing the beat.

HAWK AND ALEX

"But we'll travel along, singing
a song.	Side by Side..."

INT. TOP FLOOR HALLWAY

With a gust of wind, Kaplan and the Candy Bars bluster through the rooftop door into another hallway, where SOVIET GUARDS TWO AND THREE are taking it easy.

KAPLAN
Create a diversion.

Snickers and Butterfinger calmly blow away both guards with silenced mini-Uzis.
 

SOVIET GUARD FOUR rushes out a door before the agents, zipping up his fly. Almond Joy twists his neck with an agonizing SNAP.

THE LONG HALLWAY

Hawk, Anna, and Alex retreat beneath the Lenin mural through the windowed double doors.

Behind the doors, they poke up to see a BESPECTACLED GUARD emerge from the darkness to check out the door.

ALEX

Now that's a lock.

HAWK

Don't worry, we'll get it...

ANNA

Can I sing this time, too?
Please?

Hawk and Alex are not thrilled about the idea, but Anna's eye flutter does it.

HAWK

Uh, I guess so.

The Bespectacled Guard moves back into the darkness.

THE BALLROOM

The Soviet V.I.P.'s open up presents of pink L.A. GEAR tennis shoes, silly T-shirts, and Nintendo joysticks as a standing Darwin hypnotizes them.

DARWIN

I look at you Soviet people and I
feel... pity... superiority.	Most
of your life, your government has
told you that Capitalism turns

people into robots who'd rather
eat microwave sushi, naked in the
back of a Cadillac than hear the
laughter of children.

MINERVA
(smiling)
We're here to say, your government
was right.
 
DARWIN

So let's get busy.	Have some fun
and make some deals.

AT THE LOCK

Alex holds a lit match into the lock, while Hawk does something incomprehensible with a screwdriver. They are improvising...

HAWK

"Oh this lock is a pain in the bu-utt"

ALEX

"How'd we ever get such in a ru-utt"

Anna suddenly, booms out the chorus in a way that Hawk and Alex can barely concentrate.

ANNA

"But we'll travel the road, Sharing
the load.	Side by Side!"

THE HALLWAY ABOVE

The CIA team saunters through corpses up to a door similar in lock and design to the one Hawk and Alex are working on.

Snickers's computer screen shows the blue light directly above the green light.

SNICKERS

This is the room above the Art
Treasures room.	The lock is a
Natalya Z-Z, first created...

ALMOND JOY

Snickers, baby, I love you like a
brother, but really, who cares?
Silencer bomb...

Butterfinger pulls from around his shoulder a strange rifle. He attaches to the front of it;, a glass encased, suctioning time-bomb from a waist satchel. He fires the bomb against the door and it starts ticking.

BEHIND THE WINDOWED DOUBLE DOORS

come Hawk, Alex, and Anna, panting.

HAWK
 
That was close....

ALEX

Anna, I think you better stay....

HAWK

You can be lookout!.....	Take
Alex's gun.

Alex hands Anna his gun, who glumly takes it like a Little Sister not allowed to play. Hawk and Alex go back through the doors.

THE HALLWAY ABOVE

The CIA bomb blows up the door with a weird silencer sound. Kaplan and the Candy Bars giddily whoop as they rush through the smoking door.

THE BALLROOM--SECOND LEVEL

Anna meanders across the second level muttering to herself in Italian and amusingly imitating Hawk's condescension.

ANNA

"You can be the lookout."

Anna suddenly moves past the pillar to see the Mayflowers and the V.I.P.S. She gasps and hurls herself behind the second level railing.

THE BALLROOM FLOOR

A VERY DIGNIFIED SOVIET LEADER, in a SHIT HAPPENS baseball cap, addresses Darwin.

SOVIET LEADER

Before we serve you "the main course," hee, hee, we need to know specifics about what you can do for us. We--

DARWIN

Bluntness. How amusingly Hungarian. Listen up, for reasons I don't want to get into, I recently had to close down a petroleum factory, but I'm going to re-build it here and Madonna's going to cut the ribbon! Frozen burritos in Leningrad. 1982 fantasy. 1992 reality.

THE LOCK OUTSIDE THE DOOR
 

Hawk and Alex more frantically toil on the lock.

HAWK
"We all had our quarrels and
parted..."

ALEX

"But we'll be the same as we started...

The lock clunks open.	They race through the doors into...

INT. THE ART TREASURE ROOM

Hawk and Alex weave through the room which is crammed, with little nuance, to the gills with great art treasures including an impressive array of Faberge eggs. A solid gold hammer and sickle hang on one wall...

HAWK AND ALEX

"Just traveling along, singing a
song.	Side--"

HAWK

Geez, this place is a mess...

ALEX

Voila...

They rumble toward an opening in the wall of the room covered by a small curtain that has the Da Vinci Man in the Circle drawing emblazoned across it. Hawk reaches for the curtain. Alex puts his arm around him and speaks, not sings.

ALEX

Side by side, man...

Suddenly, the roof above them explodes. Kaplan and the Candy Bars drop down behind them.

ALMOND JOY

What the hell....

SNICKERS

You're supposed to be dead!

ALEX
I'm a ghost.	Boo.

HAWK

I don't want to sound immature,
 
but we were here first...

KAPLAN

I wish I could think of those cute
quips the way you can, Hawk, but
I can't, so I'll just shoot Alex.

Kaplan point blank shoots Alex in the chest. Alex crumples backward, moaning. Butterfinger, casually, but with incredible strength, holds Hawk's arms behind his back.

HAWK

No....

ALMOND JOY
That was pretty uncool, George...

KAPLAN

Sorry, you know he kind of reminds
me of Little Eddie.	But I digress.
Ah, victory is so sweet....

Kaplan pulls back the Da Vinci curtain.	Nothing is there.

THE BALLROOM BANQUET

A SOVIET CHEF lifts up a silver domed serving tray, revealing the Da Vinci helicopter model.

MINERVA

Yum.	This is the best meal I
ever had...

ANNA

bulges her eyes at the revelation.	She pulls out Alex's
gun and bangs herself in the head.	What to do....

THE ART TREASURES ROOM

Kaplan is bugging out.

KAPLAN

Damnit, this isn't the plan!
Blue light, green light, shit!
Snickers, Kit Kat, A.J., scramble,
see if you can find out anything.

They thunder out. Hawk, still in Butterfinger's oblivious clutches, shouts..
 
HAWK

Can't you see the Mayflowers
double-crossed you...

KAPLAN

They may be scum, but if I get the
Da Vinci model back, then we'll be
roasting weenies on the beach.

HAWK
I don't think you'll appreciate
their choice of weenie.

Kaplan raises his gun.

THE BALLROOM BANQUET

Darwin holds the Da Vinci model in one hand and raises a glass of vodka in the other.

DARWIN

You're helping us achieve a goal
and in return, I'm giving you a
key to the world's executive
washroom.	Don't piss it away....
Skoal, amigos...

ANNA (O.S.)

Stop or I'll shoot.

Minerva and some various Soviet VIPS spew their vodka to look up to Anna pointing a gun down at them from the second level. She is shivering, shaking the gun.

ANNA
You people are immoral and
narcissitic and I won't let you...

In unison, the Soviet Soldiers surrounding the table begin machine gunning up at her. She dives behind the railing.

THE ART TREASURES ROOM

Kaplan lowers his gun.

KAPLAN

I can't believe this.	I'm in
fucking Russia, or do I have to
say, the fucking Soviet Union and
I'm shooting a non-Bolshevick.
(raising back up
 
his gun)

I never thought I'd say "I'm just
in this job for the money."	Sad.
Any last immature quips?

HAWK

No.
(a beat)
But why do you let Butterfinger
keep those blood stains on his
shirt?

Falling for the oldest trick in the book, Butterfinger looks down to his shirt.

BUTTERFINGER
What blood stains....

Hawk bounces up to savagely head-butt Butterfinger. Butterfinger slams back against a wall causing the Gold Sickle to fall down around his neck and knock him to the ground, pinning his head to the floor. The Gold Hammer next trembles off the wall and crushes Butterfinger's skull.

HAWK

You want immature, how 'bout an
egg fight...

Hawk flings a Faberge egg, smashing the gun out of Kaplan's hand. Hawk pelts a batch more at him. Kaplan sloppily whips some eggs back. Hawk finally smashes one in half and beans the jagged piece into Kaplan's eye. He squeals to the ground, geysering blood.

Hawk swoops down to a wheezing, breath controlling Alex.

HAWK

Alex, are you....

ALEX
I can't believe you didn't notice.
My weight.	I lost ten pounds in
Rome

HAWK

You're a reed, man.	I gotta get
Anna.	Hang in there...

THE BALLROOM

Bullets stop splintering around Anna at the railing as
 
the soldiers fling out their empty cartridges to reload.

Snickers, Almond Joy, and Kit Kat race out of the hall-way area into the ballroom area. They stop at the sight of Anna....

ALMOND JOY

Anna-bannana-fo-fanna, I guess I
have to cut out your heart for
real now.	It's not personal.

Anna feebly raises her gun. Almond Joy laughs and pulls out a knife.

ALMOND JOY

You won't shoot.	I read your
dossier... Sister.

The Soviet Soldiers snap in new cartridges as Almond Joy moves out from behind the pillar towards Anna. The Soldiers blast away at this newly appearing figure.

Almond Joy ruptures and vibrates in a Sonny Corleone ballet.

ALMOND JOY

I gotta get a new job...

Snickers and Kit Kat militarily roll on either side of Anna as their partner wilts to the ground. The men, Snickers with his mini-Uzi, Kit Kat with his cross-bow rifle, briefly leap up to fire down at the soldiers with some graphic success.

Anna watches Darwin and Minerva head up the stairs to
her level.	She bolts off....

BALLROOM FLOOR

The last of the Soviet VIPS flee as the Soldiers tip over the M shaped table on its side, using it for cover, firing upward.

KIT KAT

breaks off and scurries around the second level to get a position behind the M.

He fires down an arrow for a successful kill. Another guard tries to fire up, but Kit Kat impales him to the back of the table with a quality shot.
 

Kit Kat grins and reloads as Alfred, the butler, regally creeps behind him.

HAWK

comes out of the long hallway double doors up to where Anna is bustling. They hug...

ANNA

The Mayflowers got...

Hawk and Anna turn to see the Mayflowers hastening in their direction. Noticing them back, the model-toting Mayflowers halt.

KIT KAT

turns to Alfred and fires his crossbow. Alfred effort-lessly cuts it in half with his blade and continues
to move forward.	Still smiling, Kit Kat tries to reload.

MINERVA

breaks the standstill.

DARWIN

What a pleasant surprise.	You're
probably wondering...

HAWK

But you're going to tell us
anyway...

MINERVA

I hate a man with a sense of
humor.	While you corn dogs were
comparing the lengths of your
masculinity, we obtained the
helicopter the new fashioned
way: a thoroughly corrupt business
deal.

HAWK

If you think you're getting past
me...

Grunting behind them, Snickers gun-butts Hawk to the ground.

HAWK

Don't be stupid...they...
 
SNICKERS

Bastard!	If you were a true
American.

HAWK

Just shut up and hit me!

Snickers swings a punch. Hawk blocks it then whomps him in the chest.

As they battle, Darwin grabs Anna's hair, slams her into a pillar, and watches her crumple.

KIT KAT

gets in an arrow but it's too late.	Alfred stabs
him deep, deep, deeply, and lifts him from the ground.

A shower of cards reading "OUCH" "PAIN" and "THIS REALLY HURTS" rain from out of Kit Kat's coat.

Alfred discards him over the edge.

Kit Kat sails down upon the M.

The lone card of "FUCK" plops from his open eyed corpse.

HAWK

and Snickers trades fierce blows, stumbling down a staircase.

DARWIN

and Minerva watch the fight with amusement. Alfred approaches.

DARWIN

Alfred, the getaway car...

SNICKERS

slashes Hawk in the arm with a small but sinister blade.

HAWK

Damnit, I hate this!	I'm a cat
burglar!	Nobody said anything
about this fight-to-the-death
shit.

SNICKERS

Too bad.
 

Snickers goes for a final thrust when suddenly one of the silencer time bombs suctions to his head.

Hawk turns to see Alex, barely standing, at the top of the stairs, holding the strange rifle.

Darwin and Minerva turn to this dramatic entrance. They start to trot off...

MINERVA

I knew it!	I told you it was a
fake.

DARWIN

That New-York-Italian-Father-
made-twenty-bucks-a-week-son-
of-a-bitch.	What was our bet?	A
million?

MINERVA

Million five, lover...

HAWK

boots Snickers down the stairs. Snickers somersaults up and frantically tries to pull off the bomb.

Snickers wails to the soldiers, who have lowered their guns and are poking their heads out of the M to watch.

SNICKERS

Help me you Democratic Reform
lovers!	Get a screwdriver, you
Stupid Eskimoes!	Screw-dri-ver!
Oh God, I always wanted to know
how to play the harp, there
just was so little time!	Rosebud!

The soldiers high-tail it out.	Snickers plugs his ears.
Nothing happens.

SNICKERS

Maybe it was just a....

Snickers blows up gloriously before the M.

THE STAIRCASE

Hawk bounds up to Alex, who puffs down onto the steps.

ALEX
 
Get 'em.	They went down the

hallway.

HAWK
Let's just forget it, I mean...

ALEX

Get em....

Hawk rushes up the. stairs, gives a "What can I do?" glance to the unconscious Anna, and then continues rushing, past a pillar. Minerva emerges from behind the pillar and moves forward.

THE LONG ENIGMATIC HALLWAY

Hawk chugs beneath the Lenin mural and down the hall-way. He sees Darwin breezing in front of him. Darwin looks back to Hawk then runs forward into the darkness.

THE BALLROOM

Minera sits down next to the pained Alex.

MINERVA

Alex.	How's it going?

ALEX

Go, go to Hell, to Hell.

Minerva pulls out a candy bar and rips it open.

MINERVA

Where's your insulin....No?	Well,
Bon Appetite.

Minerva savagely slams Alex's head down and shoves the candy bar in his mouth.

THE HALLWAY

Hawk moves closer and closer to the darkness of the hallway when a one-eyed and bleeding George Kaplan dives out of the Art Treasures room and tackles him. Hawk kicks him off...

HAWK

Oh, come on....

THE BALLROOM

Alex gulps down the last of the candy bar, shivering.
 

MINERVA

Very good, Alex, but you re
still alive....

She pulls out another candy bar. Alex, with a last burst of strength, punches her across the face.

MINERVA

That's fair.

THE LONG HALLWAY

Hawk and Kaplan lock onto each other's throats.

HAWK
Why does this have to be so hard...

KAPLAN

Tell me about it...

Suddenly, of all things, a car is heard rumbling in the darkness.

Hawk and Kaplan stop fighting and turn to see THE MAY-FLOWER LIMOUSINE screeching out of the darkness with Darwin standing out of the sunroof firing a gun.

Bullets fly around them. From his back pocket, Hawk slaps the nice picture of him and Little Eddie into Kaplan's hands.

HAWK

Take this to Hell with you...

Hawk jumps up and grabs a hanging lamp.

Deranged with confusion, Kaplan turns from the picture to the charging limousine.

KAPLAN
My pension.....

The driving Alfred smiles through the windshield.

Kaplan's body slams into a vivid somersaulting crash into the windshield.

Hawk's hands burn and sizzle on the hanging lamp.

Passing beneath, Darwin raises up his gun.
 

Hawk lets go of the lamp and drops down on Darwin, locking his legs around his neck and crushing him down into....

THE BACKSEAT OF THE LIMOUSINE

Hawk and Darwin grapple on the floor of the limo. The Da Vinci helicopter model bobs on the backseat. Darwin's gun goes off..

right through Alfred's throat. He slumps over, pressing down on the accelerator.

THE LIMOUSINE

blasts down the hallway, sparking off the wall, and bashing off paintings and mirrors.

THE BACKSEAT

Darwin flicks on his paper shredder and shoves the side of Hawk's hand into its teeth.

OUTSIDE THE LIMOUSINE

A mist of blood coughs out of the shredder vent and makes a weird bloody line across the wall.

INT. BACKSEAT

Hawk yanks his hand from the shredder and grabs the meg-lomaniac by the hair and shoves his head down on the arm rest. Hawk turns on the piercing siren and Darwin's eyes try to escape his head with a high pitched scream. Darwin's entire body bucks wildly.

Darwin back-elbows Hawk and moves down for his gun. Hawk pulls him back by his hair, grabs him by the balls, and pushes him upward through the sunroof.

DARWIN
God-damnit, I only wanted to
destroy the world in my own image.
I'm a regular Joe...

Darwin pounds his fists on Hawk's head as Hawk hits the sunroof switch sliding it shut on Darwin, pinning

his arms below the roof, but leaving his torso twisting in the wind.

The mural of a happy Lenin with his arms outstretched looms ahead waiting to greet Darwin.
 

Putting two and two together, Darwin loses it....

DARWIN
Not Lenin, anybody but Lenin.	God,
let's talk abut this.

The limousine charges through the double doors and Darwin's body connects with the mural.

INSIDE THE LIMO

Hearing the crunch, Hawk flips into the front seat and brakes the vehicle. Alfred's head bounces against the steering wheel. Hawk reaches over with a grin and picks up the Da Vinci model. He looks to Alfred, Kaplan crunched in the windshield, and Darwin's dangling legs.

HAWK

Wow, this is really gonna hurt the
resale value...

THE BALLROOM

Hawk runs up to a woozy Anna and helps her up. She has a cross-shaped blood stain on her forehead.

HAWK

Oh, honey....

Hawk looks to Alex, sitting on the stairs, the same way he left him. Hawk rushes to him.

HAWK

We did it man, we...

Hawk grabs Alex's shoulder. Alex falls back. Written over his face in red lipstick is REALLY DEAD.

Engaging a slow motion sequence, Minerva saunters behind Anna, putting on red lipstick. Minerva slams her back to the ground.

Hawk howls then turns to see stiff-upper-lip Alfred, bleeding from the neck. Hawk tries to throw a punch, but Alfred blocks it and crunches him across the face.

The Da Vinci helicopter model bounces down the stairs in slow motion and cracks open, revealing the intricate mirror of the opening scene.

INT. DARK ROOM ATOP MAYFLOWER MUSEUM--DAY
 

A damaged Hawk awakens in a dungeonish room and stumbles to some shutters. "O Solo Mio" returns on the sound-track as the shutters open to a postcard view of Vinci.

Hawk closes the shutters and cuts off the music. A slightly more composed Anna touches his shoulder causing him to jump slightly. They melt into a kiss.

ANNA
Oh Hudson...

HAWK

I told you not to call me Hudson.
The only people who called me that

were the nuns at...

ANNA

Oh Hudson, I'm a sister of the
Catholic church as well as an
agent.

HAWK
(cut-off laugh)
This is too bad to be false.

Alfred enters the room in his favorite outfit with a bandage around his neck. His voice is strange, but still polite.

ALFRED

Welcome back to Vinci.

HAWK

Last rites, sister?

ANNA

Please, no nun jokes...They're a
bad habit to get into....get it?

Hawk and Anna unconvincingly laugh then sadly pause.

HAWK

She killed Alex.

Alfred gives them a push.

INT. THE DA VINCI WORKSHOP

Alfred leads them through the Da Vinci workshop past the bat winged glider and incongruously crammed-in tennis ball machine.
 

INT. THE ROOM OF THE GOLD MACHINE--DAY

Alfred grandly opens double-doors to reveal that Da Vinci's gold machine has been majestically re-created piece by piece. In the periphery, the 90's rears its head in the form of THREE TECHNICIANS wearing headsets and gun holsters who consult computer terminals.

MINERVA (O.S.)
GOLD-FI-ING-ER!

Hawk and Anna turn to see Minerva splashily enter in sexy funeral-wear.

MINERVA
Sorry, I couldn't resist.	You're
probably wondering why you're
still alive.	Anna.....

As Minerva speaks, TECHNICIAN ONE forcibly escorts Anna toward a stand near the gold machine and tightly handcuffs her to it.

MINERVA

I want you to monitor the Da
Vinci's directions from the
apprentice diary.	And Hawk, I
didn't want you to go to hell
without knowing that Darwin and

I's dream came true.
(suddenly sheepish)
Beside that, none of us can seem
to put that damn crystal together.
Alfie and I were up all night with
the thing.

TECHNICIAN TWO commences a forcible escort of Hawk to the gold machine. Hawk cold-cocks him to the ground.

HAWK
You killed a friend.	Why should I
help you go for the gold?

MINERVA

It'll take a couple of years of
steady production, but I'll flood
the market with so much gold that
gold itself, the foundation of all
finance, will lose its meaning.
Brokers, economists, and fellow
entrepreneurs will drown in the
 
saliva of their own nervous

breakdowns.	Markets will crash-
crash.	Financial Empires will
crumble-crumble.

HAWK

Except yours-yours.	The goal of
world domination.	Well, if you
put it that way, Minnie.	How can
I resist?

MINERVA

You can't, convict! You're just a shmoe! Every shmoe has the fantasy the planet revolves around them. It rains, car crash stops traffic, you say "How could this happen to me?" It's a natural inclination. But for I, this isn't a fantasy, it is reality! You are on my planet! You walk around the corner for coffee, out of my sight, you do not fucking exist! The lives of shmoes like you have meaning only in relation to the rich, to the powerful, to ME!


Anna looks at the oil cloth diary before her. She pulls a compact from her pocket and holds the compact mirror over the scribblings. Reading off the reflection, her eyes widen.

ANNA

Do it.	There's no reason to fight
anymore.	She's a force of nature.

Trying to get a grip on Anna's words, Hawk lets himself be escorted to another stand before the gold machine that has the two complex crystal parts and the weird mirror.

MINERVA
If you pull this off, I can't
promise I won't kill you.	I mean,
who we trying to kid?	But I will
spare the Flying Nun here....

HAWK

And to think I thought you were
Evil Incarnate in pumps.

MINERVA

I killed some lovable working
 
class Italian-diabetic, but you

killed the most significant male
figure of the decade and a kind,
gentle lover.	So don't play with
me.

Minerva flicks a switch on the stand Anna's handcuffed to. Anna vibrates, being electrocuted.

HAWK
Okay, fine!

Minerva switches it off. Giving himself a head rub, Hawk bears down on the three oddly malleable objects. He TANGLES and BENDS and with a loud SNAP, puts them together, forming the Crystal from the opening scene. Minerva snatches it from him and puts on a head-set.

MINERVA

Oh Hawk, don't ever change.	Go,
team, go!

Minerva giddily sets the crystal in the same place as Da Vinci had it in his machine.

Using a long steel pole, Technician One adjusts a myriad of mirrors so they are in a proper angle with a series of lenses culminating on the top of the machine.

Technicians Two (black-eyed) and Three pour various chemical powders and liquids into corresponding compart-ments on the machine, beautifully decorated by the chemical's zodiac sign.

Alfred places a lead bar in its proper place.

Hawk glides to Anna and undoes her handcuff.

HAWK

I hope you know what....

ANNA

Trust Leonardo....

HAWK

Wha.....

Anna puts her fingers on his lips.

Minerva throws a lever. Steam begins to percolate from the furnace towards the machine.
 
MINERVA

(into the headset)
We're for real.

THE MACHINE

begins to rotate, at first clunkily, then faster.
The Crystal rotates comfortably in its compartment.

The machine throws out its folding arms, each with an element. The arms click higher.

The goggled technicians stand before a time-coded video monitor, taking notes.

The chemical housings open and the chemicals begin to spill and drop through brass tubes.

ANNA

murmurs to Hawk.

ANNA
Da Vinci made the real directions
in a secret script that I decoded.
The way the machine is running
now, the gold will produce too
quickly, clog, and the machine
will shut itself down.	Isn't it
wonderful?

HAWK

Yeah, but what would happen if that
little mirror came out of the
crystal.

ANNA

Wha -- you don't want to know...

Hawk pulls out the mirror from his pocket.

HAWK

I wanna know...

ANNA

Holy sh-h--things are going to
get very interesting, very fast.
Da Vinci would be proud of you.

IN THE MACHINE

The chemicals snake down their individual paths to the
 

Lead Bar spinning its trough. There's a FLASH and a controlled but jarring explosion.

EVERYONE

doubletakes. Hawk reaches down to the six foot steel pole and with one swing slams the faces of all three deep in concentration Technicians to the ground.

Oblivious to the violence behind her, Minerva, pulling on goggles over her head-set, moves closer with a religious purr.

THE MACHINE

triggers a fresnel lens and laserlike beams bounce around the mirrors faster and faster, circling the room.

OUTSIDE THE MACHINE

Hawk and Anna squint, blinded. Flinging off her goggles, A literally beaming Minerva giggles forward.

THE MACHINE

Beams of light converge on the top mirror and bounce into the innards of the machine with a mighty roar!

MINERVA

sees that the center of the machine gleams yellowish and molten. She moves closer, shouting into her head-set.

MINERVA

Eureka, motherfuckers!

The machine thunders and spins at a more aggressive pace.

Hawk's voice suddenly comes on Minerva's head-set.

HAWK'S VOICE (head-set)

Minnie, hate to interrupt your
orgasm, but....

HAWK AND ANNA

stand above the unconscious Technicians. Hawk is on head-set.

HAWK

Me, Anna, and Leonardo just wanna
 
say you got the Midas touch, baby...

MACHINE

Minerva turns toward the machine in anger and confusion.

The center of the machine blows. The pool of molten gold rockets at the viewer.

Mirrors explode and the lasers slash at the walls.

Minerva tumbles from the machine, screaming, that is to say, trying to scream, because molten gold covers her face. It bubbles and cascades, turning her into a bizarrely beautiful echo of Nefertiti.

HAWK AND ANNA

turn to retreat, and see, standing in the mouth of the open double doors, in an open shirt, wearing Indian war paint on his face and the words RULE BRITANNIA painted on his chest, ALFRED!

ALFRED

How.

HAWK

You're unemployed, Alfie.	Boss
is dead.	Her plan is over.

ALFRED

(strange voiced)
My plan is just beginning.	I'll
forgive you for denying me the
pleasure of slaughtering my
boorish employers, but I'm afraid
the birth of the new British
Empire can have no witnesses!

HAWK

Ooh-kay...

Alfred rushes forward with a howl. Hawk meets him halfway. They trade savage punches and then lock onto each other's throats.

Anna pulls a gun from a technician's holster and prays for forgiveness. She aims steadily, and fires...

right into Hawk's arm. This allows Alfred to knock him back with a strong punch.
 
ANNA

Sorry!

She fires again.	The bullet pings off Hawk's belt buckle.

HAWK

Stop helping me!	Thou shalt not
kill!

Hawk's turning to chastize Anna, allows Alfred to kick Hawk back against a wall. Alfred lunges out with his blade, hitting the wall off-angle. Hawk yanks the shaft. Alfred goes with the flow and presses the shaft on Hawk's throat.

Gasping, Hawk looks to a rip in Alfred's shirt and sees a hinge and lever on the shaft. With an all or nothing jerk, Hawk flicks the lever. The shaft clicks on the hinge.

Alfred's greater strength and narrower grip makes it fold away from Hawk and suddenly it is Alfred's throat which is caught in the V-shaped trap! The momentum of the sudden change makes Alfred stumble towards the wall until the point of the "V" hits it--

HAWK

Don't lose your head over this.

Hawk takes the six foot steel pole and gives a Babe Ruth swing right onto the V. The blades slam together and

POP ALFRED'S HEAD OFF, SENDING IT SCREAMING DISEMBODIED, HIGH IN THE AIR.

ALFRED'S SCREAMING HEAD P.O.V.

Hawk and Anna are seen waving up to the viewer (Alfie's head).

HAWK

Excuse my crass American humor.

The machine thunders with another explosion.

THE DA VINCI WORKSHOP

Hawk and Anna rush into the Da Vinci workshop. She guiltily touches the surface wound on his arm. He delicately takes the gun from her and laughs until he sees...

BUNNY THE DOG!! standing in the open mouth of the
 
workshop.	Anna turns to Hawk...

ANNA

Allow me.

Anna confidently moves toward the dog until Bunny leaps up and savagely clamps his teeth into her throat sending her crashing to the ground.

Hawk pauses in disbelief before raising the gun.

Bunny continues to viciously gnaw away on the convulsing Anna, blood gently starts to emerge.

Hawk can't get off a shot. He throws down the gun in exasperation. It lands next to The Gadget that is connected to the Tennis Ball Machine. Hawk rushes forward, picks up the gadget, turns the dial to Ten, and then smiles sweetly toward the dog.

HAWK

Oh Bunny, Ball-Ball.

Bunny stops his violent behavior and perkily looks up blood droplets drizzling from his mouth.

Hawk slams down on the gadget.

A tennis ball comes rocketing out of the machine.

Bunny leaps and catches the rocketing ball but the force of it sends him FLYING AND CRASHING out a window.

Hawk pulls up Anna as the machine completely EXPLODES.

A huge chunk of the roof THUDS before the workshop door.

Hawk suddenly looks off-camera and smiles. Anna shakes her head vigorously. He pulls her out of the frame.

EXT. A VINCI COUNTRYSIDE TREE

A man awakens from a nap and pulls up his hat. It is THE TRAVELING JUGGLER WITH THE UNFORGETTABLY ETCHED FACE.

He pulls his three red balls from a pouch on his mule. He begins a stoic juggle when another loud BOOM sends him to the ground.

EXT. OUTSIDE THE GRAND CASTLE--DAY

An explosion of steam and gas blows out the windows!
 
Debris frisbees toward the camera along with....

Anna, hanging on Hawk's waist, and Hawk, hanging from the bar on DA VINCI'S BAT WINGED GLIDER.

The glider gracefully swooshes down through the castle - through the glorious vista.

EXT. THE ROAD TO THE CASTLE

The glider floats to a perfect landing before the Unforgettable Juggler.

JUGGLER

Che pazzo....

Hawk and Anna collect themselves and look up to the smoke billowing castle. They smile and gush in relief. They wrap arms around the confused but warming up Juggler and laugh again.

A SMALL PIAZZA

The mule trots into a small storybook piazza in the hush of dawn. Hawk, Anna, and the unforgettable Juggler ride atop it.

A WOMAN WITH AN UNFORGETTABLY ETCHED FACE moves to a cafe table with a luminous smile. She unfolds a table cloth atop it and then mystically sets down two cappuccinos.

Hawk and Anna dismount, thank the Juggler, then cozy into the table.

HAWK
Have I ever told you the world is
beautiful...
(semi-seductively)
I'd really like to play
Nintendo with you, or something...

ANNA

Hudson, I'm afraid I'm sticking
with God.
(smiling)
But you're a close second, tough
guy.	What is that smile?

HAWK

(broadly grinning)
I got my planet back.
 

Hawk puts on a pair of sunglasses that look exactly like the ones Da Vinci wore in the opening and raises his cup.

HAWK
The first one's for Alex.	Cheers.

The viewer's viewpoint moves into Hawk's lips having a sip of that damn unmasculine European coffee.

FADE OUT.
