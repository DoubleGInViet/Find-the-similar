IN THE BLACK--

JANET JACKSON (V.O.)
This is a story about control.

Janet Jackson’s “Control” begins over...


INT. MOVES GENTLEMAN’S CLUB - LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT

Janet continues over the speakers and in the next room.

ONE SHOT: CLOSE on DESTINY (20s) sitting in front of the mirror, putting on her make-up.

JANET JACKSON (V.O.)
My control. Control of what I say. Control of what I do. And this time, I’m gonna do it my way.

The locker room is packed with DANCERS (18-49) getting ready for the shift, talking, laughing, socializing, touching, smacking each other’s butts to the music.

JANET JACKSON (V.O.)
I hope you enjoy this as much as I do. Are we ready? I am. Cause it’s all about control. And I’ve got lots of it.

Destiny puts on her mascara, as A MAN’s VOICE booms in-and-out over the music...

DJ (O.S.)
We got a bit of entertainment for

you folks tonight...

Destiny looks past her reflection, at the other girls having fun together. She’s not part of any group.

DJ (O.S.) (CONT'D)
I’m gonna introduce you to the

dream team...

JUSTICE (20s) leans down to Destiny.

JUSTICE
Hey you got a safety pin?
 


No, sorry--
 


DESTINY
 


JUSTICE (CONT'D)
Where’s Mom? Mom??

 
MOM (60s, house mom) appears out of nowhere with a wide variety of safety pins.
 
2.


MOM
Right here hon. What size you need?

Mom follows her off. Destiny reaches for a glass of vodka and downs it. Then stands, slings her bejeweled purse over her shoulder. Her clear heels turn.

DJ (O.S.)
We got a parade of beauties coming at you folks, right now...

SUPER: 2007

We follow the back of her head as she joins the rest, like football players leaving the tunnel, making their way DOWN THE HALLWAY. For a moment, they plunge into darkness. Then--


INT. MOVES - THE FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

Destiny steps into the light. The music is overwhelming. It takes a moment for our eyes to adjust. The room is enormous, two floors, no windows, pink and red neon lights, smoke machines, strobes, mirrors. The girls are transformed.

DJ (O.S.)
Here at Moves, we’re gonna give you the opportunity to have fun with any one of these lovely ladies...

Destiny walks across the floor, looking at the shapes of mostly men clustered, scattered throughout the room.

We PIVOT off of her and get a look at the DJ (30s) taking a sip of his soda before he’s back on the mic.

DJ (CONT'D)
Coupla’ ATMs in the building...
Accepting all major credit cards...
Just see our bartender, we’ll get

you all signed up there...

We pivot back to Destiny as she steps on-stage.

DJ (O.S.) (CONT'D)
C’mon boys where’s that energy?

Make some noise for the new girl!

Destiny does a quick spin to some cheers.

DJ (O.S.) (CONT'D)
New York, we got a lotta beautiful girls.
 
3.


Destiny steps off-stage, the girls disperse.

DJ (O.S.) (CONT'D)
Folks we’re gonna get it cranked up here, Justice is gonna join us on the main stage, round number one, kicking off our three song special, here she is... Justice is served!

Justice takes the MAIN-STAGE. The crowd cheers. SONG ONE.
Justice begins her routine. Destiny starts making the rounds.

WALL STREET GUY
Hey, Lucy Liu! C’mere, Lucy Liu!

A group of YOUNG WALL STREET GUYS calls her over. She walks up to them. They push the SHYEST ONE on her.

WALL STREET GUY (CONT'D)
Dan-ny! Don’t be a pussy, Danny!

Destiny leads the shyest guy by the hand to the PRIVATE AREA.

A YOUNG MANAGER (30s) takes his ID, swipes his credit card --

CLOSE on APPROVED!

Destiny leads the shy guy to a booth, sits him down...


INT. MOVES - PRIVATE AREA - LATER

Destiny dances for a BEARDED GUY.


INT. MOVES - PRIVATE AREA - LATER

An OLD MAN bounces Destiny on his lap while he talks.


INT. MOVES - MAIN STAGE - LATER

Destiny pole-dances in the spotlight.


INT. MOVES - CHAMPAGNE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Destiny dances for THREE STOCKBROKERS IN SUITS (30s). The guys pass coke back and forth to each other. The ALPHA does a bump, then looks at Destiny in disgust.

ALPHA
Who hurt you?
 
4.


The other guys laugh at her expense. Sniff their coke.

ALPHA (CONT'D)
C’mon, what’d Daddy do to you? You can tell me.

Laugh. Sniff.

ALPHA (CONT'D)
Yeah, you like that, slut?


INT. MOVES - THE FLOOR - LATER

Destiny does the rounds.

DESTINY
Anybody wanna dance?

A few guys look at her and look away. Destiny walks by the stage. Up to a BALD GUY sitting alone.

DESTINY (CONT'D)
Hey, you wanna--

From on-stage, DIAMOND (20s) grabs Destiny by her hair.

DESTINY (CONT'D)
Ow!

DIAMOND
Back off, bitch!

Destiny stumbles, looks back at Diamond waving her off.


INT. MOVES - MANAGER’S OFFICE - LATER

End of the night. The young manager sits behind a desk with a calculator and various stacks of money.

YOUNG MANAGER
... minus forty percent...is...two eighty-seven...

He counts out two hundred eighty-seven dollars.

YOUNG MANAGER (CONT'D)
... minus one-sixty...

DESTINY
I thought it was one-thirty...
 
5.


YOUNG MANAGER
You got here after 5, didn’t you?

He removes one hundred-sixty dollars and adds it to the giant stack for the house. Hands her the remaining $127. She takes it, disappointed.

He reaches out his hand. She looks at him. Then takes twenty dollars out of her stack and puts it back in his hand. He pockets it. Leans back in his chair. She starts away.

YOUNG MANAGER (CONT'D)
Hey, you wanna work Saturdays?

He unbuttons his pants. She turns away, starts out...

YOUNG MANAGER (CONT'D)
What? I thought we could bond.

She walks straight into a Skinny Manager.

SKINNY MANAGER
Is he bothering you?

She looks up at him. He puts a hand on her shoulder.

SKINNY MANAGER (CONT'D) Listen if he bothers you, you got my number, right? You call me...you need anything, someone to talk to, coke, anything, you want to keep working VIP...and don’t go telling Mom every little thing, okay? She worries cause it’s her job to but she doesn’t need to know everything.

He gives her shoulder a squeeze. Destiny looks up at him.

CLOSE on Destiny’s hands as she puts a twenty in the Skinny Manager’s palm. He pockets it.


INT. MOVES - LOCKER ROOM - LATER

The girls change back in their plain clothes. Destiny counts out her tips, deflated.


INT. MOVES - STAIRWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Destiny hurries down the stairs and out the side door.
 
6.


EXT. MOVES - CONTINUOUS

Destiny walks up the street, away from the club.


INT. CAB - EARLY MORNING

The sun is coming up. Destiny looks out the window, exhausted, the sound of Howard Stern on the radio.

HOWARD STERN (ON RADIO)
If Angelina Jolie is a 5, what’s

Jennifer Aniston?

DONALD TRUMP (ON RADIO)
I’d say she’s a 6 or a 7...
 

ROBIN (ON RADIO)
Really? Wow!
 


HOWARD STERN (ON RADIO)
Who’s a 9?

 
DONALD TRUMP (ON RADIO)
Howard. My standards are very high.

HOWARD STERN (ON RADIO)
Angelina Jolie has a great body,

big boobs, big natural lips...

DONALD TRUMP (ON RADIO)
She’s got bad skin...

HOWARD STERN (ON RADIO)
Does she...

DONALD TRUMP (ON RADIO)
She’s got scars all over...


EXT. DESTINY’S GRANDMOTHER’S HOUSE - LATER

Destiny shuffles up the front steps of the small house.


INT. DESTINY’S GRANDMOTHER’S HOUSE - LATER

She walks in the front door, the decor hasn’t changed in thirty years. Destiny climbs the steps, sore.


INT. DESTINY’S CHILDHOOD BEDROOM - LATER

The alarm sounds. 3:00 PM. Destiny wakes in her twin bed, shuts off the alarm, half-asleep.
 
7.


INT. TINY BATHROOM - LATER

Destiny blow-dries her hair, a drink on the sink.


INT. SMALL LIVING ROOM - LATER

Destiny comes down the stairs with her gym bag to see her GRANDMA (70s) sitting in her chair watching the news on an old TV. Destiny goes to her.

DESTINY
I gotta run.

DESTINY’S GRANDMOTHER
Did you eat something?

DESTINY
I’ll eat at the diner.

Destiny bends down to kiss her goodbye, notices something.

DESTINY (CONT'D)
Where’s your necklace?

Her grandmother touches her bare neck.

DESTINY’S GRANDMOTHER
... it’s fine, Dorothy.

Destiny looks at her grandmother, feeling guilty. She reaches into her bag and pulls out her cash.

DESTINY
Here.

DESTINY’S GRANDMOTHER
No, you keep it.

Destiny puts the money in her hand.

DESTINY’S GRANDMOTHER (CONT'D)
You take such good care of me.

We PUSH in on Destiny’s determined face and CUT TO...


INT. MOVES - THE FLOOR - NIGHT

The music is pumping. The floor is packed. Destiny looks around the room, through the strobes at the other girls. She sees TWO BRUNETTES “competing” for a MAN’s attention. She turns to see TWO BLONDES in baby doll dresses.
 
8.


They are all paired off. Destiny is alone.

DJ (O.S.)
And now, let’s welcome to the main-stage...the one, the only...Ramona.

Destiny turns to see RAMONA (10 years older than Destiny) take the main-stage like a boxer entering the ring. Ramona dances, commanding the room. The crowd is wild, throwing money until the stage is covered. Destiny is mesmerized.

Ramona finishes her routine with one final flourish, smacks an armful of money to her chest, and steps off-stage.

Destiny watches in awe as Ramona crosses the room, all different guys reaching out. Ramona looks them in the eyes, whispers in their ears, glides away with cash in hand.

Destiny can’t look away, as Ramona walks by, turns to her:

RAMONA
Doesn’t money make you horny?

Destiny goes to respond, but Ramona is already gone. Off Destiny’s face, we...

CUT TO:


EXT. MOVES - ROOFTOP - LATER

Ramona, sits against a skylight in her fur coat, smoking. The club noise is drowned out by the sounds of the city.

Destiny hurries outside, cigarette in her mouth. The heavy door slams behind her. She turns to Ramona.

DESTINY
Can I get a light?

Ramona turns to her, holds a lighter up to her cigarette.

RAMONA
Where’s your coat?

DESTINY
I left it inside.

RAMONA
... well climb in my fur, baby.

Destiny looks at her. Ramona opens her fur coat. Destiny takes a seat on the step below Ramona.
 
9.


Ramona wraps her coat around Destiny, warming her. Destiny looks like a baby kangaroo. They smoke together.

DESTINY
Is Justice a model?

RAMONA
She’d like to think so. A few of the girls have been in Playboy, Hustler... I was a centerfold once.

DESTINY
No way...

RAMONA
‘93.

DESTINY
... no way.

RAMONA
That was back when Stevie Wonder

came in.

DESTINY
(laughing)

Stevie Wonder? Noooo...what for?

RAMONA
Casey had him in the champagne

room. Swears he isn’t blind.

Destiny laughs into a sigh. Then...

DESTINY
Hey how come you’re so good with everybody? I mean, I’ve seen you with the guys, all different guys, and...I don’t know, you seem to have ‘em all figured out.

Ramona takes a drag.

RAMONA
I’m just a people person, I guess.
(exhales)

It’s easier if you think of them as your rich friends. Especially if you gotta see the same ones all the time. Some of ‘em aren’t so bad.

Ramona starts playing with Destiny’s hair.
 
10.


RAMONA (CONT'D)
Where else you dance?

DESTINY
I was at Sin City. For too long.
And then I heard some boiler room
guys saying all the money was in

the city so...

RAMONA
You followed the green brick road.

DESTINY
(slight laugh)

Yeah.

RAMONA
So far, so good?

Destiny gestures “so-so”.

RAMONA (CONT'D)
Get out. You must be cleaning up.
You’re new. You’re Asian. You’re

gorgeous. You’re a triple-threat.

Destiny laughs. Ramona keeps playing with her hair.

DESTINY
... well... maybe you could show me some... new moves... sometime...

Ramona looks at Destiny. It takes a moment. Then...

RAMONA
Maybe we could work together. I could give you a crash course in this place. Introduce you to some of my regulars. Mostly Wall Street guys looking to spend money on pretty girls. Would you like that?

As a smile spreads across Destiny’s face, we hear...

YOUNG WOMAN’S VOICE (V.O.) So it was Ramona’s idea that you work together...

CUT TO:
 
11.


INT. FANCY HOUSE - DAY

SOME YEARS LATER. Destiny (designer clothes) sits on a white couch in an immaculate, all-white living room. Across from her is a YOUNG WOMAN (same age, conservatively-dressed).

DESTINY
That’s right. I mean, at this point everything was above board. I thought she was...nice.

Destiny shifts in her seat, her jewelry making a lot of noise.

YOUNG WOMAN
So when would you say things got

out of control?

DESTINY
Control?

Destiny looks far off, thinking. Then, shakes her head.

DESTINY (CONT'D)
Ramona was always in control.

BACK TO:


INT. MOVES - THE FLOOR - DAY [2007]

Chopin’s Etude Op. 25, No. 1 in A Flat Major. The club is closed. Ramona and Destiny are on the main stage.

RAMONA
... of course you know the basics.

Destiny watches Ramona do various moves and poses, narrating.

RAMONA (CONT'D)
You got the carousel... the
fireman... front-hook... ankle-

hook... stag... reverse stag... peter pan... superman... you could try the scissor sit... fairy sit... genie... martini... hood
ornament... table top... and, of
course, the inverted crucifix.

Destiny watches Ramona slide down the pole with just her legs, face-first. Ramona rolls back up, ass first.

DESTINY
Jesus Christ.
 
12.


LATER --

Destiny tries to climb up the pole. She can’t help but laugh, as her arms and legs struggle. Ramona pushes up her butt. Destiny laughs, sliding back down.

LATER --

Destiny pulls herself up the pole.

RAMONA
There it is.

Destiny is at the top, leaning back. Ramona cheers her on.

RAMONA (CONT'D)
Keep your legs straight.

Destiny spirals around the pole.

RAMONA (CONT'D)
Yes, look at that! That’s gorgeous!


INT. MOVES - THE FLOOR - LATER

Ramona introduces Destiny to Diamond.

RAMONA
You know Diamond from the Bronx?

Diamond extends her fingernails to Destiny.

DIAMOND
Boogie Down heyyyyyy.


INT. MOVES - THE FLOOR - MOMENTS LATER

Ramona and Diamond show Destiny how to give a lap-dance.
Destiny straddles Diamond.

RAMONA
That’s good. Arch your back a

little.

DIAMOND
Throw your hair around. Guys like it when you throw your hair around.

Destiny throw her hair around.

DIAMOND (CONT'D)
Yeah that’s it.
 
13.


RAMONA
You don’t have to be the best dancer. You just need to make their eyes move an inch.

DIAMOND
But you gotta slow that shit down.

Diamond sits on Ramona and shows Destiny how it’s done.

DIAMOND (CONT'D)
Let me tell you something...some motherfucker’s saying shit to you, being a racist piece a shit, you take your fucking time with him. Your time is his money. You slow. That shit. Down. You a motherfuckin’ sloth. Drain the clock, not the cock.

The girls crack up laughing.

RAMONA
Yeah! Are we gonna make some money tonight?


INT. MOVES - LOCKER ROOM - LATER

The girls are getting ready. Ramona walks in with Destiny.

RAMONA
I said are we gonna make some

fucking money tonight?!

The girls all cheer, greeting Ramona, talking over each other. Ramona introduces Destiny to some of the OTHER GIRLS.

RAMONA (CONT'D)
Tracy? Have you met Destiny?

TRACY (30s) looks up and smiles.
 


Hey.
 


DESTINY
 


TRACY
You’re from Queens?

 
DESTINY (CONT'D)
Kew Gardens.

TRACY
Briarwood.

DESTINY
No way...
 
14.


STAR (30s) walks up naked, singing opera.

RAMONA
And this is Star...

Star shakes her hand, still singing.

RAMONA (CONT'D)
And you gotta meet Liz.

Destiny turns to LIZ (20s) playing a flute.

RAMONA (CONT'D)
... Liz?

MERCEDES (20s) takes a seat next to them.

MERCEDES
She’s playing a song for Jackie’s

new titties.

RAMONA
Jackie’s got new titties? Lemme

see.

JACKIE (30s) stands up and turns around.

RAMONA (CONT'D)
Oh, these are good. Who did these?

JACKIE
Dr. Bobby...

RAMONA
God bless Dr. Bobby. And this is my baby Mercedes.

Mercedes shakes Destiny’s hand.

MERCEDES
Nice to meet you.

Ramona sits next to Diamond, Destiny sits next to her, in the middle of the group. Justice comes in off the floor.

JUSTICE
Tracy. Your boyfriend’s here.

TRACY
Tsk. Again?

JUSTICE
He looks like he’s been crying.
 
15.


MERCEDES
What’s wrong with Rodrigo?

TRACY
I don’t know, he’s been really

jealous lately.

RAMONA
You can’t let him drop you off.

TRACY
I know...at first he liked it...

DIAMOND
Of course he did. Guys think they wanna date a stripper until they realize we work 6 nights a week, and on our one night off, the last thing we wanna do is look at their fucking dicks.

Destiny laughs. The other girls chime in, in agreement.

LIZ
I want to sit on my couch in my

feety pajamas, no make-up...

JACKIE
I tell my boyfriend, don’t even

look at me.

STAR
I haven’t had sex in two years.

JUSTICE
My boyfriend never sees me naked. I change under the covers.

DIAMOND
You wanna meet my boyfriend?

Diamond pulls a VIBRATOR out of her purse. The others laugh.

DIAMOND (CONT'D)
He doesn’t get jealous. He’s not
aggressive, unless I want him to

be. And he never lets me down.

RAMONA
... too bad he’s not rich.

DIAMOND
Well...you can’t have everything.
 
16.


Mom comes in with a HOMEMADE CAKE, GET $ in frosting.

MOM
Who wants cake??

The girls all react to the cake in different ways.

RAMONA
Ma, what are you doing to us?

MOM
Just a little motivation for my

babies.

Someone hands Destiny a piece of cake. Destiny looks at Ramona.

RAMONA
I’m gonna take a tiny sliver, Ma, cause I know you made it with love.


INT. MOVES - BY THE BAR - LATER

Destiny gets a drink. Ramona comes up to her.

RAMONA
Are you an investor in this place?
(putting her drink down)
Then quit putting money back into

it. Let the guys get fucked up.

We follow Ramona and Destiny toward the floor.

RAMONA (CONT'D)
Start ‘em off with a single, then a double, then a triple, then back to a double, and back to a single. You want ‘em drunk enough to get their credit card then sober enough to sign the check.

They pass the DJ. Ramona hands him a twenty.

RAMONA (CONT'D)
C’mon, Lenny. Give us a beat.

The DJ hurriedly picks a SONG. It begins as...


INT. MOVES - THE FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

SLOW-MOTION: Ramona and Destiny hit the floor, Ramona walking slightly ahead of Destiny. They’re in control.
 
17.


DESTINY (V.O.)
According to Ramona, there were

three tiers of Wall Street guys...


INT. FINANCIAL DISTRICT OFFICE - DAY

A “BOTTOM-TIER” BROKER (30s) bounces his leg while cold-calling. Ramona’s voice takes over...

RAMONA (V.O.)
The guys at the bottom don’t do anything dirty to make money, so most of ‘em don’t have any. But if they do, you can milk ‘em for every penny.


INT. MOVES - PRIVATE AREA - NIGHT

Destiny and Ramona dance for the bottom-tier guy. Ramona SHOUTS over the music but for some reason, he can’t hear her.

RAMONA
Maybe they’re in a loveless marriage or single and feeling dejected. Either way, you can string ‘em along without getting physical. Chuck here pays for my place on the Upper East Side, I’ve never even sniffed his dick.


INT. FINANCIAL DISTRICT - BULLPEN - DAY

The bullpen is packed with BROKERS on their phones, shouting, cursing, high-fiving. We focus on one MIDDLE-TIER GUY.

RAMONA (V.O.)
The guys in the middle will get
their hands a little dirty, but

they have their limits...


INT. MOVES - FLOOR - NIGHT

Ramona and Destiny watch this Middle-Tier Guy with his boys.

MIDDLE TIER-GUY
Don’t taze me, bro!

RAMONA
They dabble in greed, but they
don’t cross a certain line.

(MORE)
 
18.

RAMONA	(CONT'D)
Or maybe they’re not as good at it. Which is why they all share a two-bedroom in Cobble Hill.

The guys high-five and clink their Heinekens, but don’t do a lot of spending. Ramona steers Destiny away from them.

RAMONA (CONT'D)
Then there’s the motherfuckers on

top...


INT. FINANCIAL DISTRICT - PENTHOUSE OFFICE - NIGHT

An ASSISTANT brings a note to a CORPORATE RAIDER (50s). There’s porn playing on his computer. He takes the note but doesn’t dismiss her, making her watch the porn with him.

RAMONA (V.O.)
CEOs, CFOs, investment bankers, corporate raiders, hedge funders, ax-murderers... coming straight from the crime scene into the club.


INT. MOVES - LATER

The same high-powered man walks through the BACK DOOR, his expensive shoes hit the carpet.

RAMONA (V.O.)
But not through the front. These guys don’t want to be written about on Page Six.

Ramona greets the man. Introduces him to Destiny.

RAMONA (V.O.)
They come through the back. They
take the private elevator to the

one room without cameras.

Ramona and Destiny lead the man into the ELEVATOR.

RAMONA (V.O.)
And they don’t leave til they spent ten thousand, fifteen thousand dollars in one night.


INT. MOVES - CHAMPAGNE ROOM - LATER

Destiny opens the curtain for the man. He disappears inside.
Ramona shuts the curtain behind them.
 
19.


RAMONA (V.O.)
They can be degrading. Possessive. Aggressive. Violent. And they never get in any trouble. Because everyone is willing to cover their tracks. Cause deep down they all want what they got. They all want to be on top. Where there are no consequences.


INT. MOVES - CHAMPAGNE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

The man puts a hundred dollars on the couch beside him.
Destiny stands front and center. Ramona stands behind her.

RAMONA (V.O.)
You are just another deal to them.

And that’s all they are to you.

The girls look at him, unwavering, in control. He lays down a hundred more.

RAMONA (V.O.)
It’s business. And it’s a more
honest transaction than anything

else they did that day.

Ramona takes one of Destiny’s bra straps and slowly slides it off her shoulder. The man counts out another hundred. Ramona unhooks Destiny’s bra and Destiny slides it off. Another hundred.

RAMONA (V.O.)
All you have to do is figure out
who you’re dealing with. And then

play them at their level.

Ramona bends down, puts her thumbs under Destiny’s thong, holds out the sides, stops. The man looks at them, desperate. He puts down another and another and another and another...


INT. MOVES - LOCKER ROOM - LATER

End of the night. Destiny counts out her tips, marveling at the stack. She looks at the other girls, Jackie, Tracy, Justice, changing back into their plain clothes, talking.

Destiny turns to Ramona lining her knee-high boots with cash. So Destiny does the same. She stuffs the bills, managing to zip up one boot, can’t quite get the other. Ramona sees her.
 
20.


RAMONA
Here...

Ramona goes to help, shoving the cash further down Destiny’s boot. Then holds her heel, leg in the air, while Destiny tugs on the zipper. The two of them start laughing, then really laugh, cracking up, together.

DESTINY (V.O.)
She wasn’t in it to make friends.

It just happened.


INT. HIGH-END DEPARTMENT STORE - UPTOWN - DAY

Chopin’s Etude Op. 25 No. 9 in G-flat major. Fendi. Valentino. Balenciaga. Destiny and Ramona glide through the handbag section. Destiny poses with a gigantic Gucci bag.

DESTINY
Is it too big?

RAMONA
Are you kidding? A bag can never be too big. C’mon, let’s ring you up.


INT. HIGH-END DEPARTMENT STORE - UPTOWN - MOMENTS LATER

The SALESGIRL watches Ramona watch Destiny count out a thousand dollars on the counter. In ones.


EXT. UPTOWN STREET - LATER

Through the window of another moving car, we see an ESCALADE rolling through traffic, the sun glinting off of every curve, Ramona’s hands on the wheel, Destiny in the passenger seat, sunglasses on, talking, laughing, passing us by.


INT. RAMONA'S APARTMENT - LATER

It’s nice but not totally extravagant. Destiny stands in Ramona's WALK-IN CLOSET looking wide-eyed at all of Ramona's things. Fur coats. A wall of heels.

RAMONA (O.S.)
Oh-kay...

Destiny turns around to see Ramona presenting several HOMEMADE BATHING SUITS laid out on the bed.
 
21.


RAMONA (CONT'D)
Ta-da! I’m designing my own swim-

line.

DESTINY
Wow. You made these?

Destiny walks into the bedroom, looks at Ramona's creations.

RAMONA
I like to use a lotta mixed media, so...I find these leather pieces and I make little belts out of chains and these here are called epaulets? Which is French for little shoulders. A lot of people are scared to wear denim in the ocean but I swear these get more comfortable when they’re wet. Specifically saltwater. Try ‘em on.

Destiny steps right into the denim bikini bottoms under her skirt. Ramona goes for a piece of paper.

RAMONA (CONT'D)
It’s gonna take forever to save up the money to start a label. But one of my clients is a graphic designer and he made me this logo. Look at that. Swimona. It’s catchy right?

DESTINY
... did you go to school for it?

RAMONA
Yup. Only thirteen credits away from graduating... Oh my god those look so good on you. See?

They look in the mirror together, like sisters. The sound of the front door...

RAMONA (CONT'D)
Bear cub, is that you?

Ramona's daughter, JULIET (9) comes running into the room in her school uniform, followed by her NANNY (50s). Ramona wraps her arms around Juliet, kissing her head over and over.

RAMONA (CONT'D)
How’s my genius? How’s that great
big brain of yours?

(MORE)
 
22.

RAMONA (CONT'D)
Juliet, this is Mommy’s friend
Dorothy, can you say hi? ... She
gets shy around anyone that’s not a

cute boy.

JULIET
Mom...

Ramona tickles Juliet. Juliet laughs. Destiny smiles at them.

RAMONA
Thank you, Manuela! I’ll take it

from here.

MANUELA
Okay, good-night, Miss! Bye Juju!

Manuela waves goodbye. Ramona looks at her daughter.

RAMONA
What do you want for dinner?

JULIET
Chicken fingers.

RAMONA
Chicken fingers? No, I’m gonna make you something better than that. Go on, get out of your school clothes.

Juliet runs out. Ramona watches her go, beaming.

DESTINY
She looks just like you.

RAMONA
Good, I like to think I made her

myself.

DESTINY
... it’s just the two of you?

RAMONA
And Manuela. I don’t know what I’d do without Manuela.


INT. RAMONA’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - LATER

After dinner, Ramona and Destiny sit on the couch. Juliet is asleep in Ramona’s lap. Ramona plays with her hair. Ramona and Destiny are talking quietly.
 
23.


DESTINY
I just don’t ever want to be dependent on anyone. Like ever. I just want to be able to take care of my grandma for the rest of her life. And maybe go shopping once in awhile.

RAMONA
Yeah, that’s how I feel. I just want my daughter to be able to do whatever she wants, you know? Go to whatever school she wants, or not, if that’s what she wants. I swear, I’d do anything for this kid.
(then)
Motherhood is a mental illness.

Destiny looks at her. Half-laughs.

DESTINY
Well, that explains my mother....

Ramona looks at Destiny and pouts sympathetically...

YOUNG WOMAN (V.O.)
Is that how you’d describe her?

CUT BACK TO:


INT. DESTINY’S HOUSE - YEARS LATER

We RETURN to the white living room, Destiny and the young woman on the opposite couch.

DESTINY
My mother?

YOUNG WOMAN
I mean, Ramona.

Destiny glances down at a DIGITAL RECORDER on the table between them. Destiny’s jewelry makes noise.

DESTINY
... how much of this is going in the article? Cause I hope it’s not about all strippers being thieves or something.

YOUNG WOMAN
Not at all...
 
24.


DESTINY
Cause they’re not. It’s things like this that add to the stigma. I don’t want to perpetuate anything.

YOUNG WOMAN
Of course.

Destiny looks at her.

DESTINY
You gotta understand, I was making an honest living then. Everything was good. Everybody was making money.

Sean Kingston’s “Beautiful Girls” takes us...

BACK TO:


INT. GRANDMA’S HOUSE - DAY [2007]

Destiny gives her grandmother a stack of cash.

DESTINY (V.O.)
I helped my grandma get out of

debt...


INT. DESTINY’S APARTMENT - DAY

Ramona helps Destiny arrange her furniture. The place is small, but new, and all hers.

DESTINY (V.O.)
I got my own place in the city...


INT. MOVES - DAY

Destiny sits at the bar, studying. The place is mostly empty.
A few regulars. Some strippers on the floor with them.

DESTINY (V.O.)
Ramona inspired me to go back to

school.

STEPHEN (O.S.)
Wow.

Destiny looks over at STEPHEN (40s) eating wings.
 
25.


STEPHEN (CONT'D)
Sorry. It’s just....your penmanship

is really remarkable.

She gives him a look, can’t help but laugh at him. He doesn’t notice, face full of wing sauce. He slides down a stool.

STEPHEN (CONT'D)
Are you a student?

DESTINY
Yeah.

STEPHEN
Oh, that’s great... What do you

study?

DESTINY
Psychology...I really am a student.

STEPHEN
Oh no I believe you.

DESTINY
I’m just saying, a lot of girls
here say they’re students but I

really am getting my degree.

STEPHEN
And I think that’s great. Stephen.

DESTINY
Destiny.

STEPHEN
Destiny. You’re very...exotic-
looking. I mean, I’m into Asian

girls. It’s kinda my thing.

She looks at him. The sound of a cash register ka-ching!

DESTINY
And what do you do, Stephen?

STEPHEN
I work at Lehman Brothers. I’m sorry I don’t mean to stare. I’m just...really blown away by your penmanship. Seriously, you could be a font. They can do that, you know. You can...they can make a font of your own handwriting. So you can put it on your computer.
 
26.


DESTINY
I don’t have a computer.

STEPHEN
Oh...

DESTINY
Guess that’s why my handwriting’s

so good.

She smiles at him. He laughs, charmed, fish in a barrel.


INT. MOVES - LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT

Destiny does homework on a BRAND NEW LAPTOP. Ramona walks by, kisses Destiny’s head, proud. Destiny smiles.

DESTINY (V.O.)
2007 was the fucking best...


INT. MOVES - CHAMPAGNE ROOM - NIGHT

Destiny and Ramona dance for TWO AGGRESSIVE BIG SHOTS (40s).

DESTINY (V.O.)
I made more money that year than a goddamn brain surgeon. And sure, some days sucked, like any other job. But other days...


INT. ESCALADE - DAY

RAMONA
What do you think?

Destiny sits in the driver’s seat, feeling the steering wheel in her hands, Ramona next to her.

DESTINY
Oh yeah. This is fucking it.

We see the Escalade is parked on a SHOWROOM FLOOR. Ramona turns on the RADIO: It’s Britney, bitch. “Gimme More”.

They sing along to the song, dancing in their seats, making the Escalade shake, the SALESMEN watching from a few feet away, wide-eyed. Britney continues over:

CUT TO: VARIOUS

We INTERCUT the WALL STREET GUYS and the DANCERS...
 
27.


INT. FINANCIAL DISTRICT OFFICES - DAY

The guys in their offices, hustling their clients...


INT. MOVES - NIGHT

On the floor, Destiny, Ramona, Diamond, Mercedes, Justice, Tracy, Star, and Jackie are all hustling the guys. The guys are making it rain. The girls are securing the bag.

Stephen puts a diamond necklace around Destiny’s neck.

Tracy gently talks down her BOYFRIEND. She kisses him and sends him on his way. Then gets back to work.


INT. MOVES - LATER

Diamond yells at one of the managers. He can’t get a word in.

DIAMOND
I’m telling you right now, Carmen, you fuck with my money, I’m gonna fuck with your whole life. You hear me? What the fuck do you do here anyway? I know what the bouncers and the waitresses and the DJ’s doing, what the fuck do you do?
(walking away, still
shouting)
Get the fucking stage fixed.


EXT. GANSEVOORT ROOFTOP POOL - DAY

Destiny and Ramona are hanging out when A HANDSOME MAN (30s) comes up to Destiny. Instant chemistry. This is JOHNNY. As Destiny and Johnny flirt, we PUSH in Ramona looking at them. She’s got a bad vibe about him...


INT. DESTINY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

In the midst of Destiny and Ramona’s success, we also see Destiny and Johnny arguing with each other in the kitchen...
 

JOHNNY
 


DESTINY

 
Who gave it to you?!
 

Fuck off!

 
We whip away from them and zoom in on the TV. KEEPING UP WITH THE KARDASHIANS. PILOT EPISODE.
 
28.


KIM KARDASHIAN (TALKING HEAD) Welcome to my family. I’m Kim Kardashian.

KIM ENTERS THEIR HUGE HOUSE WITH SHOPPING BAGS.

KIM KARDASHIAN (CONT'D)
The princess is in the building!

QUICK FLASHES:

MONEY exchanging hands over and over...

DESTINY (V.O.)
The last great night I remember...


INT. MOVES - THE LAST GREAT NIGHT

DESTINY (V.O.)
It was the night Usher came in.


INT. LOCKER ROOM - THE LAST GREAT NIGHT

Liz screams to the other strippers.

LIZ
Motherfuckin’ Usher’s here!


INT. MOVES - THE LAST GREAT NIGHT

SUPER SLOW-MOTION. USHER comes in the club. We’re on the back of his head as the sea of people part for him.

The strippers are freaking out, screaming for him. The Wall Street guys are more-than-psyched to join his entourage.

DESTINY (V.O.)
They put his own music on...

The DJ spins Usher. It feels like a fucking music video.

DESTINY (V.O.)
And all the girls lined up to dance

for him...

Usher slips into a seat at the end of the stage, a long row of gorgeous girls as far as anyone can see lines up to dance for him, Destiny, Ramona, Justice, and Diamond among them. The club at its peak.
 
29.


DESTINY (V.O.)
And for one last moment, everything was so glamorous and cool.

FADE TO: BLACK


SEPTEMBER 29, 2008.

PUSH in on a SCREEN, BRIAN WILLIAMS talking to camera:

BRIAN WILLIAMS
... we begin our story tonight with what’s been called the worst financial crisis in modern times, the largest financial disaster in decades in this country, and perhaps the end of an era in American business, some of the biggest names in American business are tonight gone, along with a lot of money and a lot of jobs...


INT. DESTINY’S APARTMENT - DAY

Destiny and Johnny sit on the bed reeling, the sound of Brian Williams on TV in the background.

DESTINY (V.O.)
The crash put everybody out of business. But I had other things on my mind.

CLOSE on a PREGNANCY TEST in her hand. She starts to cry.

DESTINY
How am I gonna make money?

Johnny pulls her into his arms.

JOHNNY
I’ll take care of you.

On Destiny’s face, realizing she’s dependent on him now.

DESTINY
... I hope it’s a boy.

CUT TO:
 
30.


INT. BOX STORE - DAY [2011]

Destiny pushes her cart around the wide aisles, her DAUGHTER (2) sitting in the front, holding a Barbie.

DESTINY (V.O.)
After I stopped working, I lost
touch with Ramona. It’s just what

happens when you have a kid.

Destiny buys diapers in bulk. She browses the clothes. The shoes. The handbags.


INT. BOX STORE - LATER

Destiny stands in a long line, watching the SALESGIRL (her age) ring up her bulk items. Each BEEP across the scanner is like a knife in Destiny’s head. She looks around at the other MOMS pushing carts, wrangling their kids. BEEP. BEEP. BEEP.


INT. DESTINY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Destiny and Johnny are in the middle of a bad fight. She’s crying, storming after him. The baby is crying on the floor.

DESTINY
Good, go! We don’t need you!

Johnny walks out the front door. Slamming it behind him.
Destiny goes to her daughter, picks her up, rocks her.

DESTINY (CONT'D)
Shhhh, it’s okay. Mommy’s got you.

PRE-LAP: a RINGING PHONE...


INT. UPSCALE HOUSE - DAY

Stephen crosses his huge living room to answer his phone.

STEPHEN
Hello?

DESTINY (O.S.)
Stephen? It’s Destiny.

STEPHEN
Destiny? Wow...it’s been a few

years.
 
31.


DESTINY (O.S.)
Yeah, time flies.

It sounds like she’s been crying.

STEPHEN
Where are you?

We follow Stephen down a flight of stairs to the third level.

INTERCUT WITH:


INT. DESTINY’S APARTMENT - SAME

DESTINY
I just got back to the city. I
moved to Arizona for a few years
but I didn’t really like it. I
missed the seasons and...I missed
you. The guys in Arizona are
nothing like here...

Her BABY makes noises next to her.

DESTINY (CONT'D)
Are you still there?

STEPHEN
Yeah, I -- Do you need to get that?

DESTINY
What?

STEPHEN
Do you need to help the baby?

DESTINY
It’s my friend’s baby, I’m just watching it. Listen, I don’t mean to bother you. If you’re not happy to hear from me, I can call some--

STEPHEN
No, I’m happy. I just...
(lowering his voice)

I wish you’d called sooner...Fatima came back.

DESTINY
Who?
 
32.


STEPHEN
My fiancee. I mean, my wife. My

fiancee became my wife.

Destiny’s face/voice immediately changes.

DESTINY
Right, well, that’s how it happens.

Okay, bye Stephen.

She hangs up. Destiny looks down at a hand-written list labeled GET MONEY. She crosses Stephen’s name off the bottom of the list. Destiny looks at her baby, starting to panic...


INT. HIGH-END DEPARTMENT STORE - MOMENTS LATER

Destiny sits at the make-up counter with a EUROPEAN WOMAN. The woman looks at Destiny’s RESUME for a long time. Destiny shifts in her seat, her jewelry making noise.
