INTERVIEWER
... so your last job was in 2008?

DESTINY
Yes. It’s not like I...I had a kid, so...I was busy doing that.

INTERVIEWER
A year of waitressing. Did you graduate high school? Oh, I see here, you got your GED. Five years at Privilege Gentleman’s Club. What did you do there exactly?

DESTINY
Bartending. Mostly.

INTERVIEWER
... and what about at...Moves?

DESTINY
Mostly bartending.

INTERVIEWER
... so you don’t have any retail

experience?

DESTINY
Not yet. But...that’s why I’d really like to get experience...so that I would have it.
 
33.


INTERVIEWER
We’re really looking for someone

with retail experience.

DESTINY
(laughing)

Well, how am I supposed to get retail experience without retail experience? I mean, I sold...beer. What’s the difference?

INTERVIEWER
Maybe you should go back to

bartending.

Destiny stands up and starts out. Turns back.

DESTINY
Could I get that back? I only have one copy.

The woman gives Destiny her resume.


INT. DESTINY’S GRANDMOTHER’S HOUSE - LATER

Destiny walks in to see her daughter sitting alone on the floor, Destiny’s GRANDMOTHER asleep in her chair, the TV on.

Destiny goes to her daughter and picks her up, kissing her head. She carries her upstairs, whispering...

DESTINY
You tired? Did you get a nap?


INT. DESTINY’S CHILDHOOD BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Destiny lays her daughter down in her old twin bed and climbs in next to her, under the covers. Destiny looks up at the ceiling, her arm around her daughter. Slowly, the SOUNDS of the club get louder and louder, until we inevitably CUT TO...


INT. MOVES - LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT

Destiny sits in her old spot, putting on her make-up.

RUSSIAN STRIPPER (O.S.)
You’re in my seat.

She looks up at a RUSSIAN STRIPPER (20s).
 
34.


DESTINY
Oh. Sorry.

Destiny moves out of her way. Taking the next seat. The Russian checks her hair in the mirror. She is model-flawless.

DESTINY (CONT'D)
... you’re so pretty.

Just then, ANOTHER RUSSIAN STRIPPER (20s) steps up behind her. She’s just as beautiful. They speak Russian to each other, then walk away. Destiny looks around the room. The girls are all drop-dead. Not a familiar face in sight.


INT. MOVES - THE FLOOR - LATER

Destiny circulates the half-empty room. The mood is different. The club has changed. None of the old regulars. No longer fun or harmless. Destiny sees--

DESTINY
Mom!

Mom is working behind the bar, slinging Red Bulls.

MOM
Welcome back, sweetie.

DESTINY
They got you out front now?

MOM
Yup. Talent squandered.

Mom tosses a can in the trash.

DESTINY
What happened?

MOM
2008 happened. The guys don’t wanna spend money. The girls don’t wanna share tips. The busboys are finding more cash in the couch cushions.
The managers took the cameras outta the champagne room, so nobody’s looking out. And I’m stuck in customer service...
(turning to a customer)
Yes, I see you, hello. Another Red Bull?

Destiny looks around the room.
 
35.


DESTINY
Who are these girls?

MOM
Russians, mostly.

DESTINY
They look like models.

MOM
They’re giving blow jobs for three hundred dollars a pop.

Mom slides away. Destiny scans the room, knowing she can’t compete, knowing she can’t work it alone.


INT. MOVES - CHAMPAGNE ROOM - LATER

Destiny dances for an aggressive STOCK BROKER (40s).

STOCK BROKER
Yeah, what else you got? C’mon don’t be a tease. Are you a tease? Feel how hard you make me.

Destiny looks where the cameras used to be.

DESTINY
...we’re not supposed to...

STOCK BROKER
C’mon just stroke it. I’ll give you a hundred. A hundred? One hundred?

Destiny deliberates. He sees her consideration and pulls out his wallet.

STOCK BROKER (CONT'D)
Yeah. Stroke it. Come on.

He puts three bills on the couch.

STOCK BROKER (CONT'D)
Here. Three hundred. Please? Just

for a minute. Come on...

He pulls out a small vile of cocaine.

STOCK BROKER (CONT'D)
We’ll make each other feel good.

He taps a bump of coke on his hand, snorts it. Then taps another. Puts it in front of her. She reluctantly leans in.
 
36.


INT. MOVES - BATHROOM - LATER

Destiny sits on the toilet seat, crying. Then takes off her heels and rubs her sore foot, wincing from the pain. She puts her bare feet flat on the bathroom floor.

DESTINY (V.O.)
When I got off the floor, I saw he gave me three twenties.

CUT TO:


INT. DESTINY’S HOUSE - DAY [YEARS LATER]

Destiny looks away, her eyes welling at the thought.
Elizabeth looks at her, pained for her. Destiny wipes a tear.

DESTINY
You don’t need to believe me. I’m
used to people not believing me.
I’m only telling you so you
understand where my head was at

when I saw her.

BACK TO:


INT. MOVES - THE FLOOR - NIGHT [2011]

Destiny walks out of the bathroom, still shaken. Flo Rida’s “Club Can’t Handle Me” is playing too loud. Destiny looks around, lost, when she catches sight of a familiar face -- EVERYTHING SLOWS -- Ramona. Button-down shirt, pencil skirt.

She’s now rolling with Mercedes and a PETITE GIRL (18). The three of them corral a SHIT-FACED GUY toward the Champagne Room.

Ramona spots Destiny. They lock eyes. Like long lost sisters with a secret. Ramona takes a few steps in Destiny’s direction. Destiny does the same. They cross the room to each other, meet in the middle, face-to-face. Ramona smiles and holds out her arms. Destiny practically collapses into them.

RAMONA
Whoa...

Ramona holds her up, Destiny burrows into Ramona. They embrace in the middle of the room, swaying back and forth.
 
37.


INT. DINER - LATER

Destiny and Ramona sit in a booth across from each other.
Ramona is looking at pictures on Destiny’s phone.

RAMONA
Oh my god she’s gorgeous, of

course. How old is she?

DESTINY
Two-and-a-half.

Destiny takes her phone back. Ramona looks at her, smiling.

RAMONA
There’s nothing like it, is there? Juliet still lets me sleep in her bed but I just know she’s gonna kick me out any day.

They look at each other, bursting with years of stories.

RAMONA (CONT'D)
I missed you, you know.

DESTINY
I missed you, too.

RAMONA
Where’d you go baby?

Destiny shakes her head.

RAMONA (CONT'D)
What happened with Johnny?

They hold hands across the table. Sending messages.

RAMONA (CONT'D)
Why didn’t you call me? You and
Lily can always stay with me and

Juju. You know that.

Destiny goes to pull her hands away but Ramona holds on.

RAMONA (CONT'D)
C’mon don’t do that thing. It’s me.

Destiny looks up at her.

DESTINY
I’m so tired. It’s exhausting...
 
38.


Ramona smiles. Destiny tries to but tears fall from her eyes.
She quickly wipes them away.

RAMONA
Hey. Remember what we were like
back then? Remember? We were

fucking hurricanes, weren’t we?

DESTINY
I just need to make money. I need

to be independent. Me and Lily.

Ramona looks at Destiny. Squeezes her hand.

DESTINY (V.O.)
She told me what happened after the

crash...

BACK TO:


INT. MOVES - THE FLOOR [2008]

Ramona looks around the room. The place is almost completely empty. The few patrons are crying on the girls’ shoulders.

INT. MOVES - LOCKER ROOM - LATER

The girls are all crying on each other’s shoulders. For the first time, Ramona looks very worried. She takes out her iPhone and calls Destiny. But Destiny doesn’t answer.

DESTINY (V.O.)
With half of Wall Street
unemployed, Ramona wasn’t far

behind...


INT. CLOTHING STORE - DAY [2010]

Ramona's working retail, folding clothes at the back of the store with Mercedes.

DESTINY (V.O.)
Mercedes got her a job in fashion.

MERCEDES
... I can’t believe he got
arrested. Like now what am I
supposed to do? How am I supposed
to pay for lawyers when I can’t
even afford his half of the rent?
(MORE)
 
39.

MERCEDES (CONT'D)
It’s like...enough to make me call off the wedding.

RAMONA
Well? Listen, Mercedes...and you
know I love Dragon...but do you
really wanna marry someone who’s

probably going to prison?

MERCEDES
I don’t know. I mean...three-to-

five is a big commitment.

A RESERVED WOMAN (50s) comes out of the dressing room.

RESERVED WOMAN
I can’t get the zipper.

RAMONA
Let me help you, dear.

Ramona goes to help the woman. Zips her up.

RAMONA (CONT'D)
Wow this looks so good on you. And who doesn’t love khaki, am I right?


INT. CLOTHING STORE - MANAGER’S OFFICE - LATER

Ramona takes a breath and knocks on the half-open door.

RAMONA
Hey...Mark?

The MANAGER (20s) looks up from his sandwich.

RAMONA (CONT'D)
Hey, I was hoping you wouldn’t mind if I ducked out early on Fridays so I could pick up my daughter at school? She has half days for the rest of the year...

MANAGER
(mouth full)

Rest of the year? No.

RAMONA
Rest of the school year.

It takes him too long to finish a bite and swallow.
 
40.


MANAGER
No.

RAMONA
... well, what if I could find
someone to switch shifts with?

Mercedes said she’d--

He sighs, rolling his head around.

MANAGER
It took me forever to figure out

everyone’s stupid schedules...

RAMONA
I know, Mark. I just...I wouldn’t
ask if it wasn’t for my kid,
she’s...at a difficult age and,
well, lately she’s been having a

hard time at her new school--

MANAGER
Am I the father?

Ramona stops, confused. He looks at her.

RAMONA
What?

MANAGER
Am I the father?

She looks at him. Of course not.

RAMONA
No...

MANAGER
Then why would I give a shit?

He gets back to his sandwich.

MANAGER (CONT'D)
Don’t you have a babysitter or a

nanny or something?

Ramona shakes her head.

RAMONA
... I can’t afford that.
 
41.


MANAGER
Well, maybe if you put in more hours instead of racing out all the time...Craig’s got two kids, you don’t see him rushing home every time someone gets a nosebleed...

His voice is drowned out by Kelly Rowland’s “Motivation”, as we PUSH IN on Ramona's face...


INT. MOVES - CHAMPAGNE ROOM - NIGHT

Ramona is back at it, dancing alongside TWO GIRLS (20s) for a pair of COOL GUYS (20s, dressed down). They’re paying much more attention (money) to the other girls.

Ramona sees one of the guys gesture at her, then lean over and whisper something to his boy. His boy calls Ramona over. She dances up to them. One of them pulls out a twenty.

COOL GUY
Hey, why don’t you take a break? No offense, we’re just not feeling ya.

She looks at them. Takes the twenty and walks out.


INT. LOCKER ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Ramona walks off the floor and into the dressing room where she sees a small girl sitting on the floor, crying.

RAMONA
What’s wrong, baby?

ANNABELLE (18, the petite girl we saw Ramona rolling with) looks up at her with big eyes.


INT. LOCKER ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Annabelle watches Ramona use a tiny pair of scissors to cut the string off a tampon.

RAMONA
There...we...go. You’re gonna have

to reach in there to get it out.

Annabelle smiles, grateful.

ANNABELLE
How d’you learn to do that?
 
42.


RAMONA
Oh, some...old......
(trails off, half-laughs)

Don’t you have sisters?

Annabelle shakes her head, starts crying again.

ANNABELLE
My brothers don’t talk to me anymore. I told my mom and dad I worked here and they kicked me out of the house.

Ramona looks at Annabelle’s innocent face, plays with her hair.

RAMONA
... you wanna go fishing?

Annabelle looks at Ramona, that infectious smile.

YOUNG WOMAN (V.O.)
What’s fishing?

The sound of the NYSE CLOSING BELL takes us to...


EXT. FINANCIAL DISTRICT OFFICES - END OF WORK DAY

Guys in suits pour out of their offices...


EXT. FINANCIAL DISTRICT BAR - END OF WORK DAY

And into the bars. We PAN OVER to find Ramona, Mercedes and Annabelle seated at one of the outdoor bars, sizing them up.

RAMONA
Since the recession, the clubs need customers. So all we gotta do is reel ‘em in...


INT. FINANCIAL DISTRICT BAR - LATER

Among the happy-hour crowd, we find Mercedes sitting in a form-fitting dress at the bar.

RAMONA (V.O.)
Anyone can own one nice suit. You
wanna look at their shoes, their

watches, briefcases...

Mercedes makes eye contact with a BUSINESSMAN.
 
43.


RAMONA (V.O.)
Their wedding rings. Always look

for a wedding ring.

His wedding ring glints in her eye. Mercedes goes in.


INT. FINANCIAL DISTRICT BAR - LATER

Mercedes sits with the married businessman. They clink glasses. She touches his upper thigh. He looks down, psyched.

RAMONA (V.O.)
Once you got ‘em on the hook,

that’s when we get the net.

Just then, Annabelle and Ramona roll up to the bar.

MERCEDES
Spencer, these are my co-workers!

The girls all surround Spencer, touching him, passing around shots, pretending to drink them, passing around coke, pretending to sniff it. Spencer really does the shots. Spencer really sniffs the coke.

RAMONA
Let’s go to a club!

MERCEDES
Let’s go to a strip club!

ANNABELLE
Oh I don’t know...

Annabelle rubs Spencer’s arm. Mercedes touches his leg.

RAMONA
C’mon! We’re all gonna be at our desks at 9am regretting the moment we could’ve gone to a strip club together and didn’t...let’s do it!

SPENCER
I’m in!


INT. RAMONA’S ESCALADE - LATER

They all pile in, Ramona behind the wheel.

RAMONA (V.O.)
Then we steer him to the club...
 
44.


INT. MOVES - LATER

The girls escort Spencer through the front door.

RAMONA (V.O.)
...where we’ve negotiated ourselves

a percentage of his spending...

The MANAGER gives them a nod.

RAMONA (V.O.)
...and then we run up his credit

card as far as we can push it.


INT. MOVES - PRIVATE AREA - LATER

Mercedes holds up an empty vodka bottle.

MERCEDES
Another round?

Spencer hands over his credit card.


INT. MOVES - BEHIND THE BAR - MOMENTS LATER

Mom swipes his credit card through the machine.


INT. MOVES - PRIVATE AREA - MOMENTS LATER

RAMONA
Shots!

All the girls hold their shot glasses in the air. Spencer too, though he clearly doesn’t need it. He slams his. They pretend to slam theirs. Someone puts the bill in front of him, puts the pen in his hand. He signs without looking.


EXT. MOVES - LATER

The girls fold Spencer into the back of a cab.

RAMONA
Okay, Spencer, tell the nice man

where you live.

SPENCER
N’York.

RAMONA
Little more specific.
 
45.


SPENCER
Fith Avenue.

RAMONA
Close enough.

Ramona shuts the door. The cab pulls away. The girls can’t help but crack up, laughing.

DESTINY (V.O.)
But going fishing doesn’t mean you

catch a marlin...


INT. FINANCIAL DISTRICT BAR - ANOTHER NIGHT

Annabelle sits in a form-fitting dress at the bar, sizing up a GOOD-LOOKING GUY in a nice suit. He turns, smiles at her. She looks down at his shitty shoes. She sighs and turns away.

DESTINY (V.O.)
... and some of these guys didn’t

want to party.


INT. FINANCIAL DISTRICT BAR - ANOTHER NIGHT

The girls try the same thing on a STRAIGHT-LACED MAN (40s).
Mercedes holds up shots. He shakes his head.

STRAIGHT-LACED MAN
Oh no. No thank you.

Mercedes and Annabelle look at each other.


INT. FINANCIAL DISTRICT BAR - ANOTHER NIGHT

The girls try again on a MAN IN GLASSES (30s).

MAN IN GLASSES
Oh I can’t, but...this was fun.

He slips out, leaving the three girls alone. Another waste of a night. The bartender hands Ramona the bill.

RAMONA
Fffuck.


INT. FINANCIAL DISTRICT BAR - LATER

Ramona, Mercedes and Annabelle sit together, defeated.
 
46.


ANNABELLE
... what do we do now?

MERCEDES
I’m supposed to meet a new lawyer for Dragon. I can’t fucking afford him now.

Annabelle starts crying.

ANNABELLE
I can’t move back home.

MERCEDES
Guess it’s back to the pole.

Ramona looks at them, the wheels turning.

DESTINY (V.O.)
That’s when Ramona came up with her special recipe.


INT. RAMONA’S ESCALADE - ANOTHER NIGHT

Parked outside of the bar. Ramona shows Annabelle and Mercedes a vile of powder. They look at her wide-eyed.

ANNABELLE
Are you serious?

RAMONA
It’s barely any different than what we’re doing now. It’s a short-cut. A sure thing.

ANNABELLE
What if someone gets hurt?

RAMONA
Nobody’ll get hurt. At worst,

they’ll have a bad hangover.

MERCEDES
What if they go to the cops?

RAMONA
And say what? I just spent five
grand at a strip club? Send help?
They won’t know what happened til

they look at their bank account.

Annabelle exhales.
 
47.


ANNABELLE
I think I’m gonna throw up.

RAMONA
We’re not the only ones doing this. How do you think the clubs stay in business? Post-2008. It’s a side hustle. Everybody’s had to get creative.

MERCEDES
... I know a girl from Queens who

did this.

ANNABELLE
Did she get caught?

MERCEDES
Nah. She sent her two kids to
college. Now she lives in Miami.

Started her own nail salon.

The girls look at each other.

RAMONA
So what do you think?

BACK TO:


INT. DINER - NIGHT [2011]

Destiny looks at Ramona, wide-eyed with all the information.

DESTINY
What is it?

RAMONA
Ketamine and MDMA. The Ketamine
wipes their memory and the MDMA

makes them happy.

DESTINY
How many times have you done it?

RAMONA
Three. Including tonight.
(then)
We made five grand. Split three

ways.

Destiny exhales.
 
48.


RAMONA (CONT'D)
Could make it four.
(then)

It’d be like old times.

Ramona pushes back Destiny’s hair. Destiny’s head is spinning. Ramona leans in.

RAMONA (CONT'D)
We gotta start thinking like these Wall Street guys. I mean, look what they did to this country. They stole from everybody. Hard-working people lost everything. And not a single one of these guys went to jail. Is that fair? They’re coming in the club with stolen money. That’s who’s paying for the blow jobs. The fucking firefighter retirement fund. Fuck these guys.

A WAITRESS comes over and pours more coffee. Destiny looks at her. She walks away. Destiny watches the waitress work.

RAMONA (CONT'D)
We can’t dance forever. You want to go back to minimum wage?
(then)

The game is rigged. And it doesn’t reward the people who play by the rules. You can either stand in the corner or get in the ring.

Destiny’s wheels are turning. She looks up at Ramona.

DESTINY
I don’t want to hurt anybody. I’m

not out for revenge.

RAMONA
Me either. They would do this anyway. It’s like robbing a bank. Except they’re giving us the keys. Nobody gets hurt.

Ramona looks at her.

RAMONA (CONT'D)
... so are you in?


INT. FINANCIAL DISTRICT BAR - NIGHT

Mercedes sits close with a SHORT GUY (30s, tailored suit.)
 
49.


SHORT GUY
Well it’s getting late....

MERCEDES
Oh I guess it is. That’s a shame...

She crosses her legs. He tries to look up her skirt.

SHORT GUY
What about you? You gotta get up

early tomorrow? Or....

MERCEDES
Mmmmm...let’s have one more.

She flags down the bartender for one more round. Just then, Annabelle, Destiny and Ramona join them.

MERCEDES (CONT'D)
Hey, these are my sisters!

The girls surround him, making introductions, touching him all over, hands everywhere. Ramona gets them all drinks, giving the bartender a huuuge tip. She reaches in her bag.

Mercedes gets the short guy’s attention, distracting him while Ramona goes for his drink. The guy turns, about to see, when Annabelle steps in front of him, blocking his view with her angelic face. Destiny goes to rub his shoulders. Ramona takes a tiny vile out of her bag and taps it against his glass. The powder drops in his drink. Just a sprinkle.

RAMONA
To sisters!

GIRLS
To sisters!

SHORT GUY
To sisters!

He toasts them. Destiny watches him down his drink.

CUT TO:


INT. MOVES - NIGHT

CLOSE ON FOUR PAIRS OF HEELS WALKING WITH A MAN’S SHINY SHOES LEVITATING AN INCH OFF THE GROUND. The girls carry the short guy, half-conscious toward the --
 
50.


INT. MOVES - CHAMPAGNE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Ramona shuts the curtain behind them. The girls drop the guy on the couch. He bounces off the couch onto the floor. Annabelle grabs a bucket of champagne and throws up in it.

ANNABELLE
I’m sorry...

RAMONA
Help her.

MERCEDES
You okay?

Mercedes goes to help Annabelle. Destiny and Ramona drag the guy back up on the couch.

DESTINY
Does this always happen?

RAMONA
No...

DESTINY
Was it too much?

RAMONA
I don’t know...you alright, Gary?

Gary smiles and drools.

RAMONA (CONT'D)
Can you open your eyes, Gary?

Gary opens one eye.

RAMONA (CONT'D)
What’s that, Gary? Another round?

Gary won’t budge.

DESTINY
... what do we do?

RAMONA
Wait!

Ramona points. Destiny looks. Gary is ever-so-slowly reaching for his pocket.

RAMONA (CONT'D)
That’s it, Gary...
 
51.


He creeps out his wallet, fumbling with his credit cards.

RAMONA (CONT'D)
Which one is it, Gary, this one?

He nods yes. Ramona takes it and starts out. We follow her --


INT. MOVES - THE FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

Ramona strides up to the bar, hands the card to Mom, then looks at the dancers hard at work. The CREDIT CARD swipes...

CUT TO:


INT. RAMONA'S APARTMENT - LATER

CHAMPAGNE POPS! CLOSE on Destiny’s face, flush with adrenaline. She dances on the couch with Ramona and Mercedes, passing around the champagne bottle, music playing. Annabelle is seated, a little queasy, but happy. They’re all laughing.

MERCEDES
... no, the worst guys are the ones that put condoms on in the bathroom ahead of time. Then you know you gotta grind it out.

Mercedes steps over Annabelle, gives her a lap-dance.
Annabelle laughs.

ANNABELLE
We don’t have to go back, do we?

RAMONA
Our dancing days are over.

Annabelle smiles. Destiny smiles.

DESTINY
I can pay off my grandmother’s

house.

Mercedes fans herself with a splay of money.

MERCEDES
I think I’m gonna get myself an engagement ring. Dragon can sit in jail a few more weeks.

They all laugh. Ramona holds up the champagne bottle.
 
52.


RAMONA
To Gary!

GIRLS
To Gary!

They lift Annabelle to her feet. The four of them dance.

JULIET (O.S.)
Mom?

They turn to see Juliet in her pajamas. Ramona goes to her.

RAMONA
Oh baby I’m sorry, did we wake you?

Ramona takes Juliet’s hands and starts to dance with her. Juliet can’t help but laugh, sleepy. Ramona picks her up and carries her over to the other girls. Mercedes and Annabelle are dancing on either side of Destiny.

ANNABELLE
You guys really are my sisters.

Annabelle gives Destiny a “big sis” kiss on the cheek. Destiny beams, wrapping her arms around her “little sis”. Mercedes wraps her arms around both of them. Ramona hugs them all.

RAMONA
That’s right. We’re a family now. A family with moneyyyyyy!

The girls howl. Destiny smiles, part of the family.

DESTINY (V.O.)
Okay I know it sounds bad to say we

were, like, drugging people...

CUT TO:


INT. DESTINY’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - PRESENT

The young woman looks at Destiny, wide-eyed, recorder in hand.

DESTINY
... but in our world, it was like, normal. Half of these guys were mainlining coke on the way to work. But still, we needed to make it as safe as possible. So I suggested we tweak the recipe...
 
53.


Destiny turns on the stove. Puts on a teapot.

CUT TO:


INT. RAMONA'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - DAY

Ramona and Destiny stand at the counter.

DESTINY
What do you think, 60/40?

RAMONA
60/40 what?

DESTINY
60 MDMA, 40 ketamine?

RAMONA
... that sounds right.

Ingredients on the counter. Pills of MDMA. Viles of liquid K.

DESTINY
Do we turn the powder into a liquid or turn the liquid into a powder?

Ramona thinks. Tapping her nails. Chopin’s Etude Op. 10 No. 4 in C-sharp minor.


CLOSE ON THE PILLS BEING CRUSHED WITH A PESTLE...

CLOSE ON THE BURNER ON HIGH... WATER BOILING...

Ramona ties on an apron. Puts a plate on top of the pot of boiling water. Sets the flame low.

Destiny pours the ketamine into the plate, Ramona watching, like mother and daughter baking a cake. The liquid slowly evaporates. Ramona stirs. Destiny refills the pan until only a powder remains. They mix the two powders together.

Destiny and Ramona each sample a tiny amount.

CUT TO:

They are asleep on the floor. Ramona slowly wakes up. She leans over and wakes up Destiny. They look at each other.

DESTINY
Let’s try it in the oven.

CUT TO:
 
54.


The liquid ketamine bakes in a glass pan. Ramona opens the oven, wearing oven mitts, and pulls out the glass pan. She sets the pan on top of the stove to cool. Destiny looks at the crystals, in awe.

DESTINY (CONT'D)
How much?

RAMONA
Just a sprinkle.


INT. RAMONA’S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - LATER

Ramona and Destiny clean up after themselves.

DESTINY
I’m still not sure about strangers.

RAMONA
But that’s the beauty of ‘em.

They’re strangers.

DESTINY
I don’t want to slip it to anybody who’s not already on something. We gotta know these guys like to party. And that they have money to lose. Enough to not care if some is missing. With strangers, it’s unpredictable, there’s no guarantee.

Ramona nods in agreement. She starts to smile.

DESTINY (V.O.)(CONT’D) (CONT'D)
So we called up some old friends.


INT. RAMONA’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

CLOSE on Ramona's phone as she scrolls through her contacts... Dev Bear Stearns, Eddie Goldman Sachs, David Morgan Stanley... She picks one. Like cold-calling.

Mercedes and Destiny watch Ramona at work, Annabelle in the background, playing with Juliet and Lily.

RAMONA (INTO PHONE)
David, is that you? It’s Ramona.
(...)

Well I definitely remember you and I’m sure you remember me because nobody ever forgets meeting me.
(MORE)
 
55.

RAMONA (INTO PHONE) (CONT'D)
(...)

Why don’t I send you a picture and jog your memory?

RAMONA TAKES A PHOTO OF ANNABELLE.

RAMONA ATTACHES THE PHOTO TO A TEXT: Hit me up xx. SEND.

Almost immediately, Ramona’s phone BUZZES with a response.


INT. FINANCIAL DISTRICT BAR - LATER

Annabelle sits too close to DAVID (40s). (We remember him as the WALL STREET GUY from the club. Mr. Lucy Liu.) Just then, Mercedes, Ramona, and Destiny roll up to the bar.

MERCEDES
David, these are my friends!

QUICK MONTAGE:


INT. FINANCIAL DISTRICT BAR - VARIOUS NIGHTS

A parade of familiar faces, assholes we met before 2008...

ANNABELLE

The girls surround Guy #2, touching, distracting Guy #3, handing a drink to Guy #4, Guy #5 takes a sip...

CLOSE on the powder dissolving in their drinks...

CLOSE on their hands clinking glasses...

INT. RAMONA’S APARTMENT - VARIOUS

The girls pop champagne, celebrating.


INT. DESTINY’S GRANDMOTHER’S HOUSE - DAY

Destiny gives her grandmother a giant stack of money and a kiss on the cheek. Her grandmother beams, so proud.


INT. RAMONA’S APARTMENT - DAY

Ramona helps her daughter with her homework, as Manuela cleans up after dinner. Ramona smiles, grateful she’s back.

INT. LAWYER’S OFFICE - DAY

Mercedes shakes hands with a HIGH-POWERED LAWYER for Dragon.


INT. ANNABELLE’S BROOKLYN APARTMENT - DAY

Annabelle rearranges furniture in her own place. She sits on her couch with her CAT, looks around, happy, independent.

INT. HIGH-END DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY

The four girls try on shoes. Destiny watches Ramona on one of her many cell phones.

DESTINY (V.O.)
Maybe one of ‘em would call and

complain but we could handle it...

RAMONA
What are you talking about? You had a great time. You were so happy you kept tipping everybody, remember?

DESTINY (V.O.)
Ramona could always handle it...

RAMONA (INTO PHONE) What are you gonna do? Call the police? Are you really gonna tell your wife and the police what you did? Does that sound worth whatever amount you think you’re missing? You went out, you had an epic night, it cost money, why should it cost you any more than that?
 
57.


DESTINY	(V.O.)
We treated it like a business...


INT. RAMONA’S APARTMENT - DAY

Destiny and Ramona sit at the kitchen table surrounded in paperwork, their daughters play together in the background.

RAMONA
... so Annabelle’ll meet JP Morgan and Mercedes’ll meet Wells Fargo.

DESTINY
Mercedes met Wells Fargo last time.

RAMONA
How much did we charge last time?

DESTINY
... five thousand on his American
Express and two thousand on his

corporate card.

RAMONA
Does he have any airline miles?


INT. HIGH-END DEPARTMENT STORE - DRESSING ROOMS - DAY

Annabelle and Mercedes try on expensive dresses.

DESTINY (V.O.)
We branched out, cultivated a

certain level of clientele...


INT. FINANCIAL DISTRICT BAR / UPSTAIRS RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Annabelle sits next to a HANDSY MAN (40s).

ANNABELLE
An architect. Whoa. No wonder you

got such nice hands.

DESTINY (V.O.)
... but the bigger the fish, the

bigger the bait had to be.

The architect bites her neck. She tries to stay playful.

ARCHITECT
Let’s fuck in the bathroom.
 
58.


ANNABELLE
Owwwhhh...hang on...my sisters

should be here any minute...

Annabelle tries to keep his hands at bay...

DESTINY	(V.O.)
So that’s when I said...I mean,

that’s when we realized...


INT. RAMONA'S ESCALADE - NIGHT

Parked. Destiny turns to Ramona in the driver’s seat.
Destiny’s lips move, BUT WE HEAR...

DESTINY (V.O.)
We need to be outsourcing.

Ramona nods and responds, lips moving, BUT WE HEAR...

CUT TO:


INT. DESTINY’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

Destiny hands the young woman a cup of tea.

DESTINY
So we put an ad in Craigslist.

BACK TO:


INT. MALL FOOD COURT - DAY [2012]

ONE SHOT: FOUR RECRUITS (20-39) sit with trays from the various vendors. The girls are sore thumbs, even at the mall. Mom stands in front of them, clipboard in hand. Destiny stands behind her, taking mental notes.

MOM
Okay, lovelies. Does anyone have
any allergies? Anything life-

threatening?

GEORGIA (20) speaks up first.

GEORGIA
I got asthma.

Next to her, CRYSTAL (20s).
 
59.


CRYSTAL
I don’t like feet.

MOM
You have a foot allergy?

CRYSTAL
I’m just saying if a foot goes near my face, I will shut down.

TRIXIE (30s) raises her hand.

TRIXIE
I don’t mind feet.

MOM
Great, you two’ll work together.

Trixie and Crystal wave at each other.

MOM (CONT'D)
Okay, now everybody find a partner and let’s work on our fake-drinking and sniffing.

Destiny looks up to see Ramona and a STRUNG-OUT BLONDE (30s) walking over. She joins the group with a plate of noodles. Ramona joins Destiny, beverage in hand.

DESTINY
Where were you?

RAMONA
They have an Orange Julius.

Ramona holds out her Julius. Destiny takes a sip of it.

DESTINY
What’s Coco doing here? We said no junkies, no criminals.

RAMONA
So?

DESTINY
So she’s a junkie and a criminal.

RAMONA
People change...

They look at Coco practicing a real sniff of cocaine.
 
60.


RAMONA (CONT'D)
Fine, but I promised her lunch.
(turns, gasps)

And who’s this??

Ramona runs over to ANGEL (30), a TINY DOG in her purse.

ANGEL
This is Mr. Bruce.

Destiny watches Ramona takes the little dog in her arms.

ANGEL (CONT'D)
I take him with me everywhere, I

hope that’s not a problem.

RAMONA
Not at all.

Mom tries to wrangle everybody back on course.

MOM
Okay, angels, eyes up here, now
let’s work on our etiquette. Does

everybody have a fork?

The girls all hold up their plastic forks.


INT. MALL - LATER

The girls flood the department store, browsing the racks of nicer clothes, trying on make-up, sampling perfume. The other SHOPPERS look on. The SALESGIRLS are shocked. Ramona holds up a dress. Destiny holds up a credit card.


INT. RAMONA'S ESCALADE - VARIOUS NIGHTS

Parked. Ramona behind the wheel, Destiny beside her. They turn to see Mercedes and Georgia in back, Herve Leger dresses...

DESTINY
No drinking. No drugs.

INTERCUT WITH:

Annabelle and Angel (and Mr. Bruce) in the back-seat...

RAMONA
Once you get the signature, you can party your head out.
 
61.


INTERCUT WITH:

Crystal and Trixie in the back-seat. Ramona hands over a vile of powder. Crystal takes it...

Annabelle takes the vile...

Mercedes takes the vile.

CUE: Scott Walker’s “Next”...


INT. MOVES - CHAMPAGNE ROOM - VARIOUS

Georgia and Trixie dance for the Stockbroker who gave Destiny three twenties. Just when they think he’s gonna pass out, he rises to his feet and dances with them. The girls look at each other. Georgia uses her inhaler.

Angel and Annabelle dance for the Alpha, waiting for him to pass out. When he finally does, they play with Mr. Bruce.

Crystal and Mercedes are whispering in the Corporate Raider’s ear. He looks like a baby in their arms.

MERCEDES
What’s your mother’s maiden name?

CRYSTAL
And what are the last four digits

of your social?

We JUMP CUT from night to night, as each of the guys begins to lose consciousness...Crystal and Trixie keep going with the dancing stockbroker until... he slowly falls like a tree through the glass table and SMASHES through it. The table shatters into pieces.


INT. RAMONA'S ESCALADE - MOMENTS LATER

Parked. Destiny is on the phone, card in hand.

DESTINY
6-6-1-0. And what’s my balance?

Ramona looks at Destiny, proud.

DESTINY (V.O.)
I could do all the math in my head.
 
62.


INT. MOVES - NIGHT

The bouncers hold the doors open for Destiny and Ramona as they walk in like pimps, with their girls in formation.

DESTINY (V.O.)
Like if you told me the bill was 40 grand, I knew everybody’s cut.

All the employees smile and nod at them, as the girls make their way through the room.

DESTINY (V.O.)
There were nights and weekends when we brought 100 grand into the club. And everybody got in on the action.

SUPER: Moves Gentleman’s Club declined to comment.

DESTINY (V.O.)
The hosts. The managers. The DJ. This is during the recession, mind you. Without me making the effort to go out and market and promote, they wouldn’t have a business. We weren’t just some disposable
dancers anymore. I was CFO of my
own fucking corporation.

Destiny looks around, standing tall.

CUT TO:

MOVING MEN. As far as the eye can see, lugging heavy furniture, couches, bed frames, boxes labeled FUR. SHOES. A FEW SWEATING MEN emerge from the truck carrying a TANNING BED. We follow the tanning bed, as they carry it into...


INT. RAMONA'S NEW APARTMENT - DAY

Destiny and Ramona watch the men drag everything inside and up the stairs. Ramona gestures at the living room...


INT. RAMONA'S NEW APARTMENT - CHRISTMAS MORNING

Ramona and Destiny sit around the Christmas tree with their daughters and employees, Mom, Annabelle and Mercedes, and Manuela and her two daughters, all opening gifts. Destiny’s grandmother among them. Full house. Destiny’s grandmother opens a blue jewelry box and gasps.
 
63.


DESTINY’S GRANDMOTHER
Oh, Dorothy. What have you done?

DESTINY
You always said you wanted real

pearls.

Destiny puts the necklace on her grandmother.

DESTINY’S GRANDMOTHER
Did you go to the bottom of the

ocean for these?

DESTINY
Something like that.

Destiny’s daughter LILY (now 4) unwraps a Barbie dreamhouse.

LILY
Mommy it’s the one I wanted!

DESTINY
Say thank you to your Aunt Ramona.

LILY
Thank you Auntie Mona.

RAMONA
Of course, Lily girl.

Lily gives Ramona a hug. Mercedes opens a box of Louboutins and screams. Destiny and Ramona look at each other, proud.

Ramona unwraps a GUCCI PURSE.

RAMONA (CONT'D)
Oh my god, it’s enormous!

DESTINY
Do you like it?

RAMONA
No...I love it. I’m gonna carry all my other bags in it.

Ramona gives Destiny a kiss. Then, hands her a big box.

RAMONA (CONT'D)
Your turn.

Destiny unties the red ribbon. Opens the box lid. Gasps.

DESTINY
What was it?
 
64.


RAMONA
Chinchilla.

Destiny pulls out a long fur coat. She tries it on. Running her hands all over it. She smiles at Ramona, marveling.

RAMONA (CONT'D)
I’m so proud of you, Dorothy.

Destiny stops. Like she’s needed to hear that her whole life.

RAMONA (CONT'D)
We don’t need anybody else, do we?

Destiny shakes her head, smiling.

DESTINY
Nobody.

Ramona throws an arm around Destiny.

RAMONA
We’re the untouchables. Like Kobe

and Shaq.

DESTINY
Who’s Kobe?

RAMONA
I’m Kobe and your Shaq.

DESTINY
Why do you get to be Kobe?

They wrestle into a hug, laughing, making each other laugh harder.

MOM
Okay, everybody get together!

Mom takes a picture of everyone on her new iPhone.


INT. RAMONA'S DINING ROOM - LATER

Chopin’s Etude Op. 10 No. 3 in E major. There’s an enormous spread. Ramona sits next to Destiny’s grandmother, Destiny across from them, everyone’s heads bowed in prayer.

MERCEDES
... and thank you God for all that you have given us...

(MORE)
 
65.

MERCEDES (CONT'D)
this delicious food, my new
Louboutins, and especially for this
family, my sisters, we are so

blessed. Amen.

EVERYONE
Amen.

They eat family-style, hands passing plates, everyone enjoying each other’s company. Destiny looks around, every seat filled. She smiles, surrounded.


INT. RAMONA'S DINING ROOM - LATER

End of the meal. Annabelle clears the table. Ramona is holding court, mid-story. Everyone’s listening, captivated.

RAMONA
... so my friend brings me over to his table and introduces us and, you know, I don’t usually get nervous around these types, but suddenly he’s in front of me and...
(to Destiny’s grandmother)
... do you know who he is, Nana? Do you get UsWeekly?

DESTINY
She knows. She’s seen him. You’ve

seen him, Nan. From the movies.

DESTINY’S GRANDMOTHER
I seen him. He’s very good-looking.

RAMONA
Well, listen, Nan, he’s even better looking in person...

Ramona takes Destiny’s grandmother’s hand. Destiny clocks it.

RAMONA (CONT'D)
... so he picks me up in this white Porsche. And all he had told me was to wear a hat...

DESTINY
The Kentucky Derby.
 
66.


RAMONA
... that’s what I thought... But suddenly we’re at the airport and we’re boarding this private jet to Monaco, and there was champagne and lobster and a butler and...I didn’t have the heart to tell him that I hate flying. So there I was, in this gorgeous marble bathroom...
(laughing)
... ten thousand feet in the air,
vomiting champagne and lobster...
(calling out)
... Bella, come here, you’ll like
this story...
(to Nan)
... Annabelle can throw up on
command. It’s one of her many
gifts...
(to Annabelle)
... come here, baby...

Annabelle comes over to Ramona, laughing. Ramona puts Annabelle on her lap, bouncing her like a kid, continuing...

RAMONA (CONT'D)
... well, eventually the plane
landed and, well, we had three of
the most magnificent hours before
the paparazzi caught up with us.
And I’m afraid that’s the end of
the PG-13 version.

Everyone sighs with laughter, wishing the story wouldn’t end.
Destiny’s grandmother slowly leans over to Ramona.

DESTINY’S GRANDMOTHER
I once danced with Frankie Valli...

Ramona bursts, grabbing Destiny’s grandma’s hand.

RAMONA
WHAT?? NAN?

Everyone bursts with her. Ramona turns to Destiny.

RAMONA (CONT'D)
Did you know this?

Destiny shakes her head, smiling, but...

DESTINY’S GRANDMOTHER
It was before he was married. The

second time.
 
67.


RAMONA
Oh I don’t know, Nan, you sure

about that?

DESTINY’S GRANDMOTHER
... pretty sure.

Everyone howls, laughing. Ramona screams, stomps her feet.

RAMONA
This woman is my spirit animal!

LATER:

RAMONA PUTS FRANKIE VALLI ON THE IPOD. CUE: RAG DOLL.

Everyone is dancing in the middle of the living room. Ramona dances with Destiny’s grandmother, like old friends. Destiny dances with the others, watching the two of them, smiling.

RAMONA (CONT'D)
(shouting over the music)

... tell the truth, Nan. If Frankie Valli had shown up on your wedding day and said “it’s me or your husband” what would you have said?

Her grandmother takes an elderly beat. Then:

DESTINY’S GRANDMOTHER
“Which car you driving?”

Ramona throws her head back and screams, then finds Destiny’s face across the room.

RAMONA
How have we not met sooner??

Destiny and Ramona smile at each other. Ramona turns back to Destiny’s grandmother and dips her. Grandma laughs.

YOUNG WOMAN (V.O.)
So...whose idea was it to start

drugging them?

Destiny stops smiling.
