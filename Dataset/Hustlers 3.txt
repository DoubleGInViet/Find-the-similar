INT. DESTINY’S HOUSE - DAY

Destiny looks at the young woman interviewing her.
 
68.


DESTINY
Is that what you’re hung up on?

YOUNG WOMAN
... it’s hard not to be.

Destiny looks at the recorder.

DESTINY
What’s your name again?

YOUNG WOMAN
Elizabeth.

DESTINY
Did you grow up with money,

Elizabeth?

ELIZABETH
We were...comfortable.

DESTINY
Right. What’d your parents do?

ELIZABETH
My dad was a journalist. And my

mom’s a psychiatrist.

DESTINY
Where’d you go to school?

ELIZABETH
Brown. For undergrad.

DESTINY
What would you do for a thousand
dollars? Of course the answer
depends on what you already have

and what you need.

ELIZABETH
So the drugging was Ramona’s idea?

DESTINY
You know, I don’t think I should
talk to you anymore. I’m sorry. I
don’t know you and...these girls

are like my sisters. I’m sorry.

Destiny reaches for the recorder...

ELIZABETH
It’s okay, I understand...Ramona

said the same thing.
 
69.


Destiny stops. She looks up at Elizabeth.

DESTINY
You talked to Ramona already?

ELIZABETH	DESTINY (CONT'D)
... yeah.	When?

ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
Yesterday.

DESTINY
Where?

ELIZABETH
I went to her work.

DESTINY
Pfff.

ELIZABETH
What?

DESTINY
Nothing. Just...the idea of Ramona Vega going straight. It’s like....a
vampire doing....

Destiny trails off. She can just picture the two of them.

FLASH TO:


INT. RAMONA’S OFFICE

RAMONA AND ELIZABETH TALKING TO EACH OTHER ACROSS RAMONA’S DESK. WE CAN’T HEAR WHAT THEY’RE SAYING. IT’S TORTURE.

BACK TO:

DESTINY
So if you talked to her already,

what do you need me for?

ELIZABETH
I was hoping you could...fill in

any blanks.

Destiny clenches her jaw. Seeing red.

DESTINY
Blanks.

FLASH TO:
 
70.


INT. RAMONA’S OFFICE

RAMONA SAYS SOMETHING THAT MAKES ELIZABETH LAUGH. ELIZABETH WRITES SOMETHING DOWN. CAN’T SEE IT. CAN’T HEAR IT.

BACK TO:

Destiny shifts in her seat. Her jewelry making noise.

DESTINY
Hmmmm... where was I?

BACK TO:


INT. RAMONA'S ESCALADE - NIGHT [2012]

Ramona and Destiny pull up in front of Moves to see a TEAM of BLONDES leading a DAZED MAN out of their SUV.

RAMONA
Copycats.

Ramona turns to Destiny...

RAMONA	(CONT'D)
I don’t think we need ‘em anymore.

WE SEE ELIZABETH IN THE PASSENGER SEAT. IN DESTINY’S PLACE.

ELIZABETH
Who?

RAMONA
The clubs.

Ramona plays with Elizabeth’s hair.

RAMONA (CONT'D)
Why should we have to split

anything when we can have it all?

FADE TO:


INT. RAMONA'S BRAND NEW ESCALADE - NIGHT

February, 2013. Ramona sits behind the wheel, her face lit by an iPad, Destiny beside her, looking out the passenger window, anxious. They are parked outside of an UPSCALE HOTEL. They’re both in fur coats.

RAMONA
I think I’m gonna buy these.
 
71.


Destiny looks at Ramona. She’s zooming in on a pair of Gucci shoes. Destiny turns back out the window.

DESTINY
What’s taking her so long?

RAMONA
Relax, she’s a pro.


INT. UPSCALE HOTEL - MOMENTS LATER

DAWN (20s) comes teetering out of a room in her heels, talking to herself. She hurries down the hall.

DAWN
3427, 3427, 3427, 3427...

She tries not to get distracted by the apartment numbers as she makes her way to the elevator. Hard to tell if she’s dumb or on drugs. She presses down. The door opens. She steps in.


INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

She looks at the numbers. Tries not to get distracted.

DAWN
3427, 3427, 3427...

A WOMAN (60s) gets in the elevator, on her cell phone.

WOMAN ON CELL
We could meet at 5 or 6... No, 6 is good... You want 5?

Dawn plugs her ears, mumbling. The doors close.


INT. RAMONA'S NEW ESCALADE - CONTINUOUS

RAMONA
I’m gonna fucking buy these.

Ramona swipes her finger across the screen. Destiny looks at her. We PUSH in on Destiny’s face... and hear a DING!


INT. HOTEL LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

The elevator opens. Dawn hurries away from the woman...

DAWN
3427, 3427, 3427...
 
72.


INT. RAMONA'S NEW ESCALADE - CONTINUOUS

Dawn runs up to Destiny’s window, credit card in hand.

DAWN
3427.

Dawn is obviously dumb and on drugs. Destiny gives her a furious look. Pulls out her cell.


INT. RAMONA'S NEW APARTMENT - NIGHT

Ramona paces. Destiny sits at the table, bouncing her leg.

RAMONA
Where the fuck are they?

DESTINY
Annabelle’s feeling grossed out

lately.

RAMONA
And what about Mercedes? Is she feeling grossed out? We can’t keep giving them their cut if they’re gonna disappear for weeks on end. We need a bigger crew.
(pulling out phone)
I’m calling Coco.

DESTINY
No. She’s a cokehead.

RAMONA
What about Crystal?

DESTINY
She just got out of jail.

RAMONA
Trixie?

DESTINY
She’s still in jail. Ramona.

Quit...bringing home strays. We’re breaking the law here! We don’t want to work with criminals!

CUT TO:
 
73.


INT. DESTINY’S HOUSE - THE INTERVIEW

Destiny explains her logic to Elizabeth.

DESTINY
It’s like if we’re a team and we’re making money and winning games, are you gonna suddenly start trading players and bringing in new people? But did she listen?

BACK TO:


INT. RAMONA’S NEW APARTMENT - NIGHT

Destiny walks in to see Ramona with her arm around Dawn.

RAMONA
Dorothy, this is Dawn.

Destiny takes one look at DAWN and hates her rotten guts.

DAWN
Hiiiiiii.

CUE: The Four Seasons’ “Dawn (Go Away)” begins to play in Destiny’s head. It continues over...

CUT TO: LATER

The girls are all getting ready together for the night out. Destiny looks across the room at Ramona playing with Dawn’s hair. We PUSH in on them. We PUSH in on Destiny.

RAMONA
As soon as I saw her I said,
please, you’re gorgeous, you must
join us. And she said...

Tell ‘em what you said, Dawn.

Them. Destiny.

DAWN
I said...what, is it a cult?

They laugh. Destiny does not.

RAMONA
It is a cult, isn’t it?

DESTINY (V.O.)
But the real problem was...Ramona had absolutely zero business sense.
 
74.


INT. FINANCIAL DISTRICT BAR - NIGHT

DESTINY (V.O.)
Look what happened with Victor.

Dawn slips too much powder into VICTOR’s (40s) drink.

DESTINY (V.O.)
He was good-looking, had money, not a genius, not a pervert. That’s the quadruple-threat right there.


INT. RAMONA'S NEW ESCALADE - PAST

Parked. Ramona on her cell in the driver’s seat, Victor’s card in hand.

RAMONA
What’s my credit limit again? Fifty thousand?

She turns to Destiny. Destiny shakes her head.

RAMONA (CONT'D)
Let’s do it for the full fifty.

DESTINY
We’ll never see him again.

RAMONA
Who cares.

DESTINY (V.O.)
That’s the problem with Ramona. I
saw the forest. She saw the fifty

thousand dollar tree.


INT. RAMONA'S NEW APARTMENT - NIGHT

Ramona scrolls through her phone. Looking frustrated.

DESTINY (V.O.)
She burned through our regulars.
Which left us with unpredictable

strangers...

PRE-LAP, a door-bell...
 
75.


INT. RICH MAN’S HOUSE - NIGHT

The door opens. Destiny is on the front porch. Mercedes is crying in the doorway, wearing vintage Swimona.

DESTINY
Where is he?

MERCEDES
Out back.

Mercedes follows Destiny out back to see --


EXT. RICH MAN’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

A NAKED MAN face down on the concrete, unconscious, bleeding from his head... a foot away from the pool.

DESTINY
What happened?

MERCEDES
He said he could dive off the roof and I said he couldn’t.

Destiny looks up. Then down.

DESTINY
... you were right.

She goes to him and feels for a pulse. Thank God.

DESTINY (CONT'D)
Where’s Georgia?

MERCEDES
She took off.

DESTINY
Where the fuck’s Ramona? This is

her client...

MERCEDES
I couldn’t get a hold of her.

DESTINY
Goddamn it. Alright, get his legs.

MERCEDES
Is he dead?

DESTINY
Not yet.
 
76.


MERCEDES
(crying harder)

We’re not gonna kill him, are we?

DESTINY
No! We’re gonna take him to the

hospital. Help me get him...

Destiny and Mercedes peel him off the ground.


EXT. RICH MAN’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

They carry the bleeding man toward Destiny’s Escalade and we see Annabelle in the passenger seat. She turns to see them.

ANNABELLE
Oh no no no no...

DESTINY
Get the door.

Annabelle climbs out, opens the back door, throws up.

ANNABELLE
I’m sorry...

DESTINY
Call Ramona. And don’t stop until

you reach her.

Destiny and Mercedes fold his body into the back-seat.


INT. DESTINY’S ESCALADE - LATER

Destiny drives, Annabelle beside her, covering her mouth. Mercedes is in back, the naked man leaning against her, unconscious.

DESTINY
Has she texted back?

Annabelle shakes her head, trying not to vomit. Mercedes sees a COP CAR at the next light.

MERCEDES
Slow down...

Destiny sees it too. Slows down. Just then, the naked man opens his eyes. He turns to Mercedes.

MERCEDES (CONT'D)
Jesus Christ--
 
77.


Annabelle turns to see him and starts screaming. Mercedes jumps, startled, accidentally elbowing the man in the face. He’s out cold again.

The three women look straight ahead. Waiting for the light to change. We don’t see the cop’s faces. It takes too long. Finally, a green light. The cop car pulls ahead. Destiny slowly hits the gas. Annabelle throws up on herself.


INT. DESTINY’S ESCALADE - LATER

They pull up to the EMERGENCY DROP-OFF at the hospital.

MERCEDES
Where are we gonna put him?

DESTINY
We’re gonna take him inside.

MERCEDES
I thought we were gonna leave him.

DESTINY
We can’t leave him.

MERCEDES
I’m not going inside.

DESTINY
Mercedes, this is a business...

Mercedes opens the car door and runs away in her bathing suit.

DESTINY (CONT'D)
Mercedes!

Destiny calls after, but Mercedes’s bare feet are gone.
Destiny turns to Annabelle in the passenger seat. Useless.

Destiny hops out of the car and goes around back, dragging the unconscious, naked man out. A SECURITY GUARD sees her, calls for the MEDICS who come running out to help. Destiny fake-sobs.

DESTINY (CONT'D)
My husband... my husband...

The medics take over as she wails. She looks at Annabelle slumped over. Then, reluctantly helps Annabelle out of the car.
 
78.


DESTINY (CONT'D)
My sister... my sister...


EXT. HOSPITAL - LATER

Destiny paces outside, covered in blood, cell phone to her ear. The sound of ringing. Then:

RAMONA'S VOICE
Hi this is Ramona...please leave your name and number and where we met and I’ll get right back to you.

DESTINY
Bitch!


INT. DESTINY’S ESCALADE - MORNING

Destiny tears into the driveway, screeches to a stop. She runs out of the car, engine running, races out, still in last night’s clothes, and inside --


INT. DESTINY’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

She bursts through the door.

DESTINY
Lily? Lily?

She hurries through the house. Her daughter’s room is empty.

DESTINY (CONT'D)
LILY??

She runs back down the hall to the kitchen where she finds a NOTE. She races out of the house to --


EXT. DESTINY’S NEIGHBOR’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Destiny bangs on the door. A WELL-DRESSED WOMAN (30s) answers the door holding Lily.

WELL-DRESSED WOMAN
There’s Mommy...

LILY
You’re late.
 
79.


WELL-DRESSED WOMAN
The baby-sitter said she had to go home but we had ourselves a fun sleepover, didn’t we?

LILY
Yeah!

Destiny reaches out for Lily, hurriedly taking her in her arms. The woman looks at Destiny’s clothes, concerned.

DESTINY
Yeah, thanks, c’mon, Lily.

WELL-DRESSED WOMAN
... do you want me to take her?

DESTINY
I got her, Amy, thanks.

Destiny rushes off in her heels with Lily.


INT. DESTINY’S ESCALADE - LATER

Destiny pulls up at the school drop-off, gets out of the car and suddenly realizes what she looks like. She opens the back door, helps Lily out of her car-seat.

LILY
Aren’t you gonna walk me?


EXT. SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS

Destiny holds Lily’s hand as they quickly make their way up to the school. A few other PARENTS look at Destiny. Her five-inch heels. Last night’s clothes.

PARENT (O.S.)
Is that blood?

The walk seems to take forever. They finally reach the doors.

DESTINY
Okay have a good day...

Destiny leads Lily inside, then turns and walks all the way back to her car, everyone watching, the sound of her heels.

DESTINY (V.O.)
Where was Ramona when I needed her?
 
80.


EXT. NYC PRECINCT - SAME TIME

Ramona is bailing Dawn out of jail.


INT. DESTINY’S ESCALADE - LATER

In the school lot, Destiny gets in her parked car, covered in blood. She looks down to see her cell ringing, RAMONA. Destiny answers, furious tears in her eyes.

DESTINY
Don’t ever call me again.

RAMONA (THROUGH PHONE)
Baby...

Destiny hangs up. And starts her car.


EXT. DESTINY’S GRANDMOTHER’S HOUSE - LATER

Destiny pulls her Escalade in front. She shuffles up the steps. Opens the front door.


INT. DESTINY’S GRANDMOTHER’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Destiny walks in to see her grandmother sitting in her chair. Destiny stops. She knows immediately that her grandmother is dead. Destiny braces herself in the doorway.


EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

Destiny buries her grandmother, her daughter sitting next to her. The PRIEST is speaking when SOMEONE walks up and takes the empty seat next to Destiny. Destiny looks over to see...

RAMONA. Wearing black. She reaches out for Destiny’s hand. Destiny leans into her, tears rolling down her face. Ramona puts her arm around her, their heads on top of each other.

RAMONA
I’m sorry I wasn’t there, baby.

Destiny sobs in Ramona’s arms.


EXT. CEMETERY - LATER

Juliet and Lily run around in the grass. Ramona and Destiny are still sitting in the same spot.
 
81.


DESTINY
I don’t want to go home.

RAMONA
Do you and Lily wanna stay with us?

Destiny slowly nods yes.

RAMONA (CONT'D)
I’m supposed to meet someone. If

you want to join me.

Destiny knows what this means.

RAMONA (CONT'D)
Take your mind off things.
(then)
No pressure.
(then)

But if you need the money...

We HOLD on them for awhile.

DESTINY (V.O.)
I knew it had to stop...

CUT TO:


INT. DESTINY’S HOUSE - DAY

The interview continues.

DESTINY
I kept thinking there was this magic number, that if I could save enough money, I could start clean. Me and Lily. Maybe a score so big, we wouldn’t need anybody.

ELIZABETH
Is that what happened with Doug

[BLEEP]?

Destiny looks up at Elizabeth.

DESTINY
Uh... I don’t remember a Doug

[BLEEP].

ELIZABETH
Ramona said...
 
82.


DESTINY
Well, she’s a liar. She’ll say anything to make herself sound better. What’d she say about me? I’m sure she had a lot to say. What did she tell you?

Elizabeth looks at her. Takes a long pause. Proceeds slowly.

ELIZABETH
She said you had a tough time growing up. That you spent a lot of time alone. That you got in fights and...had some bad boyfriends.

DESTINY
What else.

ELIZABETH
She said your parents were
immigrants. And that after your
father left, your mother dropped

you off at your grandparents...

Destiny gets lost in the memory.

FLASH TO:


EXT. DESTINY’S GRANDMOTHER’S HOUSE - 1989

MOM’S CAR DRIVES AWAY FROM US AND DISAPPEARS OVER THE HILL

BACK TO:

ELIZABETH
... and never came back.

Destiny stares off.

ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
Is that true?

Destiny nods yes, still lost in the thought.

DESTINY
I thought maybe she was taking a break...that maybe moms just needed a break.

The tears fall, but Destiny wipes them away.

DESTINY (CONT'D)
Why would she tell you all that?
 
83.


ELIZABETH
I think she wanted me to understand that...for you it wasn’t about revenge. You were just trying to make friends.

Destiny can’t look at Elizabeth. The tears keep falling.

ELIZABETH (CONT'D) Destiny. I know I’m supposed to think that what you did is terrible and that these men didn’t deserve it, but...the truth is...I don’t feel that sorry for them.

Destiny wipes her tears away. Nods her head.

DESTINY
I feel sorry for them.
(then)

I keep having this nightmare. Where I’m in the back-seat of a moving car...and then I realize that nobody’s driving the car...and like I have to climb in the front seat and try to get hold of the wheel but like...I can’t get a grip on it and I can’t stop it no matter what and...then I wake up.

Destiny looks up at Elizabeth. Then reaches out and pushes STOP on the recorder.

The sound DROPS OUT...

But it’s clear that Destiny is ending the interview. She asks Elizabeth to leave.

Escorts her to the front door. Elizabeth walks out. The door shuts on her. We STAY with Elizabeth.


INT. ELIZABETH’S HOUSE - LATER

No sound, as Elizabeth shuffles through the door, exhausted. She flops on the couch. A beat, then she stirs, reacting to something. She reaches for her bag. Pulls out her cell. DESTINY CALLING. Elizabeth answers.

THE SOUND RETURNS. Destiny’s V.O. is now over the phone.

DESTINY (THROUGH PHONE)
Ramona met Doug years ago...
 
84.


INT. MOVES - [2011]

Ramona, in her stripping days, gives comfort and advice to a PALE MAN (30s) who is sitting at the bar, hunched over.

DESTINY (V.O.)
His friend took him to the club to blow off some steam after a few devastating events that included...

CUT TO:


STOCK FOOTAGE: SUBURBAN HOMES DESTROYED BY A HURRICANE

DESTINY (V.O.)
His house being leveled by a

hurricane...


INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

DESTINY (V.O.)
... and separating from the mother of his young son.

DOUG and his LAWYER sit across from his WIFE and HER LAWYER.


INT. FINANCIAL DISTRICT BAR - NIGHT [2013]

Destiny and Dawn are sitting at a table with Doug. Dawn is sneaking coke, leaving Destiny and Doug in conversation.

DOUG
She never really wanted to have kids, you know? So...when we found out he was autistic, I think she just couldn’t handle it, you know?

Destiny looks at him, sympathetically.

DESTINY (V.O.)
We talked about our kids. We talked about our exes. We had a heart to--

RAMONA
Drinks!

Ramona returns with their drinks. Doug takes his drink.

DOUG
Oh thank you.
 
85.


Destiny watches Doug take a big sip. Her hand almost reaches out to stop him, but... he swallows.

ELIZABETH (V.O.)
And then what happened?

THE ROOM GOES QUIET.

ELIZABETH (V.O.)
Destiny? Destiny??

CLOSE on Destiny’s guilt-ridden face, as we...

INT. DOUG’S SMALL KITCHEN - DAY

Doug now sits across from Elizabeth. Recorder on the table.

DOUG
The room was...round?

FLASH TO:


INT. CHAMPAGNE ROOM - FRED’S POV

DOUG
There was a...table?


HIS HANDS. BARELY VISIBLE. HE PUTS THEM DOWN ON THE TABLE. BACK TO:

INT. DOUG’S SMALL KITCHEN - DAY

DOUG
I couldn’t feel my face.

Elizabeth looks at Doug. He can’t even make eye contact.




INT. RAMONA'S NEW APARTMENT - DAY [2013]

Destiny is on her cell, Doug’s voice in her ear, crying.
 
86.


DOUG (THROUGH THE PHONE) Can you please just credit back my debit card? My mortgage payment is on there...

Destiny tries to stay strong.

DESTINY
What are you talking about? You had a good time.

DOUG
Why are you doing this to me?
(she can’t respond)
Please I have nothing. I can’t
afford to not pay my mortgage.
(she can’t respond)
My son.

DESTINY
(almost inaudible)

... I’m sorry.

RAMONA
Hang up the phone, Destiny.

We see Ramona sitting nearby. Destiny doesn’t hang up. Ramona bursts from her chair then goes for the phone, trying to get it out of Destiny’s hand. The two of them fall to the ground. As they roll around, Ramona grabbing at the phone...

RAMONA (CONT'D)
If we. Don’t. Do it. Somebody.

Else. Will.


INT. DOUG’S SMALL KITCHEN - PRESENT DAY

Doug talks to Elizabeth...

DOUG
They maxed out my corporate card. So my company launched an internal investigation and I was fired.

NOW, DESTINY SITS IN ELIZABETH’s PLACE. FACE-TO-FACE WITH DOUG.

DOUG (CONT'D)
When I finally got a new job, I was told that my name had been reported to an agency that tracks white-collar crime and I was fired again.
 
87.


Chopin’s Etude Op. 25, No. 11...


INT. CAB - DAY

Destiny sits in the back-seat, looking out the window at the city passing by. Her eyes are tired, worried, her mind racing. She turns ahead. And we are now in --


INT. DAISY’S MOM’S CAR - DAY

NOBODY IS DRIVING THE CAR. WE ARE IN HER NIGHTMARE. Destiny panics. She climbs into the front seat, her body heavy. She grabs the wheel, trying to turn it, but it doesn’t work. The brake won’t work. As Destiny starts to scream, we....

CUT TO:


INT. NYC PRECINCT - DAY

A DETECTIVE (40s) sits at his desk blotting two slices of pizza on paper plates. His phone rings. He keeps blotting the slices for awhile, then fumbles with the oily napkins, shakes them off into the trash can by his feet. He finally answers.

DETECTIVE
Precinct.

DOUG (THROUGH THE PHONE) Yes hello I... I went to a strip club and I was drugged and my credit card was ran up.

The detective hangs up. Then picks up the pizza and takes a bite. After a moment, his phone rings again. He answers.

DETECTIVE
Precinct.

DOUG (THROUGH THE PHONE)
I was drugged and I have proof.


INT. DINER - ANOTHER DAY

Elizabeth interviews the DETECTIVE and ANOTHER DETECTIVE (50s).

DETECTIVE
It was weird.
 
88.


DETECTIVE #2
It was real weird. If it wasn’t for the tape I woulda been like “Dude you’re fucking full of shit.”


INT. DOUG’S APARTMENT - DAY

CLOSE on a TAPE RECORDER playing. Doug sits with members of the DEA TACTICAL-DIVERSION SQUAD, listening to the sound of Doug’s recorded tears.

DOUG’S VOICE (ON TAPE)
Please. I just want to know what

happened to me.

Recorded Doug sobs. One of the officers stifles a laugh.

DAWN’S VOICE (ON TAPE)
You were fleeced, that’s all.

DOUG’S VOICE (ON TAPE)
By who?

DAWN’S VOICE (ON TAPE) We’re like a little gang. You were just a target. We just gave you a sprinkle.

THE SCENE FREEZES.

DESTINY (V.O.)
They never said who it was but I

fucking know.


INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

Dawn is dropped in the seat, hands in cuffs. Immediately:

DAWN
I’ll tell you everything. What do you want to know? Please I don’t want to go back. I’ll do anything.

THE SCENE FREEZES.

DESTINY (V.O.)
The cops won’t admit it, but this

is exactly how it went down.
 
89.


INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Dawn opens the door. Destiny and Ramona are in the hallway.
AUDIO: The scene is heard through the WIRE-TAP on Dawn’s bra.

DAWN
Did you bring the drugs?
 


Shhhhh...
 


RAMONA
 


DESTINY
Where is he?

 
DAWN
He’s in the bathroom...

They walk inside the suite. Looking around.

DAWN (CONT'D)
I don’t think he likes me. I think one of you has to do it.

DESTINY
(suspicious)

Are you high?
 

RAMONA
Give her a break.
 


DAWN
Me? No! No, I...I don’t do
that anymore.

 
Destiny looks at Dawn, even more suspicious. A toilet flushes. A GUY (30s) emerges from the bathroom to see the three of them.

DAWN (CONT'D)
Hey, these are my friends. This is

Ramona and--

DESTINY
Ronda.

Dawn looks at Destiny. The guy looks psyched.

HOTEL GUY
Well, alright...

DAWN
Here why don’t you sit down and we’ll fix you a drink? C’mon girls you want to help me?

Dawn forces him into a chair. Ramona and Destiny follow Dawn to the kitchenette/mini bar out of view. Destiny takes a vile out of her purse. Dawn pours a mini scotch into a glass.
 
90.


DAWN (CONT'D)
Alright, now do it.

Destiny looks at her.

DESTINY
Well, go ‘head.

Nobody moves. Dawn looks at them, getting frustrated. She grabs the vile, dumps it in the drink, walks it back to him.

HOTEL GUY
Oh thank you very much.

The girls all go back to the living room, sitting around the man as he takes a sip.

HOTEL GUY (CONT'D)
So...how is this usually done?


INT. RAMONA'S NEW ESCALADE - LATER

Ramona speeds down the FDR. Destiny is panicking beside her, looking back.

DESTINY
I’m telling you it’s the same

fucking car.

RAMONA
You’re being paranoid.

DESTINY
I saw the same fucking Buick parked outside the Gansevoort.

RAMONA
That’s not a Buick.

DESTINY
Well whatever the fuck it is, it’s been following us for twenty minutes. Can’t you see? Dawn was setting us up back there.

RAMONA
Dawn?? Now I know you’re paranoid.

DESTINY
You think Dawn wouldn’t sell you

out to save herself?

Ramona reaches out to her. Destiny smacks her hand away.
 
91.


ELIZABETH (V.O.)
So? Was there a sting?


INT. DINER - DAY

The detectives try to keep their poker faces with Elizabeth.

DETECTIVE #2
We...cannot comment on that...at
this time...but what we can tell
you was that the amount of people
willing to talk to us was so small

it was absurd.

ELIZABETH
Why?

DETECTIVE #2
I guess men don’t want to...admit to what happened to them, you know? To being victimized. By a women. But then we found the architect.


EXT. CITY STREET CORNER - DAY

The detective buys a newspaper from a VENDOR, about to walk away when he sees the cover of the DAILY NEWS. He picks it up and opens it, searching for a section. Finds it, reads it, eyes growing wider.

DETECTIVE (V.O.)
The Connecticut architect who Moves said failed to pay a 135 thousand dollar bill he’d racked up during four visits to the club.


INT. NYC PRECINCT - LATER

The detective shows the article to the other detective.

DETECTIVE #2
“For a night of pleasure he can’t

even remember...” What a boob.


INT. NYC PRECINCT - SARGEANT’S OFFICE - LATER

The detectives show the SERGEANT (60s).
 
92.


SERGEANT
So the guy got drugged and then
went back three more times? Guess

he must’ve liked it.

They all share a hearty laugh.


INT. DINER - DAY

The two detectives talk to Elizabeth.

DETECTIVE
When you look at it out of context it seems like he’s making it up...


INT. FINANCIAL DISTRICT BAR / UPSTAIRS RESTAURANT - PAST

We see Annabelle with the handsy architect.

ANNABELLE
An architect. Whoa.


INT. NYC PRECINCT - DAY

The architect gives a statement to a SKEPTICAL COP (50s).

DETECTIVE (V.O.)
But when we put it together with

Doug, it all added up...


INT. FINANCIAL DISTRICT BAR / UPSTAIRS RESTAURANT - PAST

ANNABELLE
Peter, these are my sisters!

We PUSH in on Annabelle as she looks up at Ramona, Destiny, and Mercedes coming to the rescue.

DETECTIVE #2 (V.O)
It’s scary isn’t it?


INT. DINER - DAY

Elizabeth looks at the two detectives.

DETECTIVE #2
I mean we all got so spooked...none of us went to the club anymore.
 
93.


Elizabeth writes something down, stifles a smile.


INT. RAMONA'S NEW APARTMENT - DAY

Destiny puts the DAILY NEWS down in front of Ramona, open to the architect article. Ramona looks at it. Doesn’t flinch.

RAMONA
Good. Maybe now he’ll pay his bill.

Ramona goes back to filing her nails. Destiny looks at her.
Ghost white. Terrified. Destiny swallows.

EXT. CITY STREET - MORNING

CUE: Lorde’s “Royals”

May 23, 2013. We follow the back of Ramona's head, as she walks down the sidewalk. She’s in athleisure, carrying her gym bag. She waves to a neighbor.

We follow Ramona all the way to the corner store. She stops in front of an ATM, her back to the street. Slides her card. Gets out $200. No receipt. Cash in hand. Turns around.

The COPS have her surrounded, their guns drawn. They didn’t make a sound. Ramona puts her fists in the air.

COPS (O.S.)
Hands where we can see ‘em!

Ramona has great difficulty opening her fists. She finally does. The money flies out of her hands and down the street.

INT. VISITING ROOM - MORNING

Mercedes, dressed up, visits HER BOYFRIEND (20s) in prison.
She squeezes his hand, a giant engagement ring on her finger.


EXT. PRISON - LATER

The GUARD walks Mercedes outside. Her heels click on the pavement. The gate opens. A row of COPS waits for her. She looks at them. Then looks back at the prison. Confused.
 
94.


INT. ANNABELLE’S APARTMENT - MORNING

Annabelle feeds her cat, then sits with a cup of tea, in her pajamas. Her cell buzzes. It’s a TEXT from Destiny: Run.

There’s a KNOCK at the door. Annabelle looks up. Then bursts from her seat. Grabs her cat. The door is kicked in. Annabelle tries to climb out the fire escape but the COPS grab her. The cat jumps out of her arms. Annabelle throws up.

ANNABELLE
Oh God, I’m sorry...

The cops put her in hand-cuffs, trying to avoid the vomit.


EXT. DESTINY’S HOUSE - MORNING

We follow the back of Destiny’s head as she walks out her front door, hands in the air, surrendering.


EXT. DESTINY’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

They put her in the back of a car. She sees Lily in the neighbor’s arms, watching her. Destiny tries to look strong.

INT. NYC PRECINCT - LATER

Destiny joins Ramona, Mercedes and Annabelle. They’re like different exotic birds chirping in a cage. Annabelle is crying, vomit on her shirt. The detective steps up.

DETECTIVE (O.S.)
Which one of you’s the ringleader?

Destiny and Ramona look at each other...


INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER

The two detectives walk Ramona into the room.

RAMONA
This is unbelievable. You guys
really are something, you know

that? Does Tony know about this?

DETECTIVE #2
Sit down, Miss Vega.

Ramona sits.
 
95.


RAMONA
We didn’t do anything wrong. This
is crazy. Tony wouldn’t let this

happen. I’m texting him.

She pulls out her phone.

DETECTIVE #2
Tony doesn’t...who gave her her

phone back?


INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER

The two detectives sit across from Destiny. Destiny looks terrified. We PUSH in on her face as we hear their voices.

DETECTIVE #2
... think about your daughter.

DETECTIVE
You’re facing felony charges here. You really want to go down for someone else?

DETECTIVE #2
You want Lily to grow up without

her mother?

DETECTIVE
You think these girls are your
friends? You think they’re not

gonna rat you out?

DETECTIVE #2
Think about your daughter...


EXT. NYC PRECINCT - DAY

Ramona and Destiny walk down the steps of the precinct. Destiny looks dazed, beaten. Ramona’s looking at her phone, plotting, as they make their way down the sidewalk.

RAMONA
Mercedes’ll probably use Dragon’s lawyer, so you and me and Annabelle should probably lawyer up. Do we know any lawyers from the club? That guy Jeremy. Or maybe Anton?

DESTINY
... I took the deal.
 
96.


Ramona stops. Turns to her.

RAMONA
... you did?

Destiny nods her head, starts to cry. Ramona looks at her.
And explodes:

RAMONA (CONT'D)
Have I taught you fucking nothing?

Ramona paces.

RAMONA (CONT'D)
You stupid fucking idiot what the

fuck is wrong with you?

Ramona grabs Destiny by the shoulders and shakes her.

RAMONA (CONT'D)
How could you do that??

DESTINY
-- Lily.

Ramona stops. She looks at Destiny. Ramona clenches her teeth, but her chin starts to tremble. Ramona shakes her head. Then pulls Destiny in by the shoulders. They hug each other, crying on each other’s shoulders.

RAMONA
Motherhood’s a mental illness.

Ramona holds Destiny in her arms. They know this is it for them. This is goodbye.

DESTINY
... I’m sorry.

Ramona shakes her head. She squeezes Destiny tight, angry tears on her cheeks.

RAMONA
... we were fucking hurricanes,

weren’t we?

Ramona pulls away first. Destiny’s arms are still reaching out as Ramona walks away from her.

CUT TO: BLACK

It is quiet. Then... a RINGING PHONE takes us to...
 
97.


INT. ELIZABETH’S HOUSE - DAY [2014]

Elizabeth, now pregnant, answers her phone. In the background, a BABY SHOWER in progress. It’s a girl.

ELIZABETH
Hello?

DESTINY (O.S.)
Elizabeth...it’s Destiny.

ELIZABETH
Hey, Destiny. How are you?

INTERCUT WITH:


INT. DESTINY’S HOUSE - SAME

Destiny sits in her living room. Her voice almost echoes from the emptiness. No sound except her jewelry.

DESTINY
Good. Really good. Lily’s good. Um...we’re moving back to Queens. But...I’ve been making a ton of new friends. And I met a man who’s helping me get a job in pharmaceuticals. Are you still there?

ELIZABETH
I’m here, Destiny.

DESTINY
Well, I’ve been thinking about
things and...maybe the reason we
did what we did? Is cause hurt

people hurt people. You know?

Elizabeth opens a door to another room.

DESTINY (CONT'D)
Have you talked to Ramona lately?

ELIZABETH
No...just the one time.
(then)

Have you?

DESTINY
No...

Destiny looks across the room at her daughter playing.
 
98.


DESTINY (CONT'D)
Can I ask you...
(then)

What else did she say about me?

CUT TO:


INT. CLOTHING STORE OFFICE - THE DAY OF RAMONA'S INTERVIEW

Ramona sits across from Elizabeth, now in the manager’s chair. There’s a warmth between them. Ramona has her big bag open on the desk.

RAMONA
... so I was living in the Bronx at the time but I was seeing this guy who had this walk-up right next to where I stripped, so I was staying at his place like every night...and then this one morning, I went back to my place and my front door was wide open and it just freaked me out, you know? That all my stuff, all my valuable stuff was in this place that I wasn’t even sleeping in...so now I just carry everything with me all the time.

Ramona opens up her bag and begins a show-and-tell.

RAMONA (CONT'D)
This was a patch from my grandpa’s uniform. He was in the Navy. This was my grandma’s wedding band and this was my mother’s, see the three birthstones are me and my sisters.

Elizabeth looks at her, endeared.

RAMONA (CONT'D)
One lives in Texas, the other one’s in Arizona. We try to get together once a year but it’s impossible with kids. Do you have kids?

ELIZABETH
Not yet.

RAMONA
Oh don’t worry, you’re young. You
have amazing skin. Everyone must

tell you that.
 
99.


Elizabeth notices something in the bag.

ELIZABETH
Is that you?

She points at a photo of a YOUNG GIRL. Ramona laughs.

RAMONA
Yeah, that’s me. A senior asked me to the prom. Look how terrified. I like my dress though.

Ramona pulls another photo out from behind it. LITTLE DESTINY. We recognize her sweet face.

RAMONA (CONT'D)
And that’s Dorothy. Wasn’t she the cutest? Who could leave this baby?

Ramona gazes lovingly at the photo of Little Destiny.

RAMONA (CONT'D)
We used to say...if only we had
known each other back then...you
know? Maybe we could’ve...been
there for each other...and maybe
our whole lives would’ve been
different, you know?

She looks at the two photos side-by-side. Ramona at fifteen. Destiny at five. Ramona gets em at the thought. Tears in her eyes for the first time. She smiles them away.

RAMONA (CONT'D)
Maybe it’d be the same. Who knows. I can’t talk to her. But...I still like to carry her with me.

Ramona puts her childhood photo face-to-face with Destiny’s childhood photo and slides them back in their place.

BACK TO:

INT. MOVES GENTLEMAN'S CLUB - NIGHT

The world turns. Another night in the club, the floor packed with men paying to watch the women dance. As we witness the exchange, we hear a familiar voice...

RAMONA (V.O.)
There’s really nothing I can say to make sense of what went down. But everybody’s hustling...


INT. RAMONA’S OFFICE - THE DAY OF HER INTERVIEW

Ramona looks just past us.

RAMONA
This city, this whole country is a strip club. You got people tossing the money. And people doing the dance.

The night of their first big score. Destiny, Ramona, Mercedes, and Annabelle are celebrating together. Janet is playing. They’re lined up in the living room.

RAMONA
5-6-7-8.

The four girls do choreographed moves together, laughing, cracking up, dancing with each other, dancing for themselves.
