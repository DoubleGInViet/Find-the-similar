EXT—DAIRY FARM—DAY
The modest dairy farm in the countryside of Nancy, France (what the French call cow country).
We read a SUBTITLE in the sky above the farmhouse:
CHAPTER ONE
“ONCE UPON A TIME IN . . .
NAZI-OCCUPIED FRANCE”
This SUBTITLE disappears and is replaced by another one:
“1941
One year into the German
occupation of France”
The farm consists of a house, a small barn, and twelve cows spread about.
The owner of the property, a bull of a man, FRENCH FARMER, brings an ax up and down on a tree stump, blemishing his property. However, simply by sight, you’d never know if he’s been beating at this stump for the last year or just started today.
JULIE
one of his three pretty teenage daughters, is hanging laundry on the clothesline. As she hangs up a white bedsheet, she hears a noise. Moving the sheet aside, she sees:
JULIE’S POV
A Nazi town car convertible, with two little Nazi flags attached to the hood, a NAZI SOLDIER behind the wheel, a NAZI OFFICER alone in the backseat, following TWO OTHER NAZI SOLDIERS on motorcycles, coming up over the hill on the country road leading to their farm.
JULIE
Pappa.
The French farmer sinks his ax in the stump, looks over his shoulder, and sees the Germans approaching.
The FARMER’S WIFE, CHARLOTTE, comes to the doorway of their home, followed by her TWO OTHER TEENAGE DAUGHTERS, and sees the Germans approaching.
The farmer yells to his family in FRENCH, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:
FARMER
Go back inside and shut the door.
FARMER
(to Julie)
Julie, get me some water from the pump to wash up with, then get inside with your mother.
The young lady runs to the water pump by the house. She picks up a basin and begins pumping. After a few pumps, water comes out, splashing into the basin.
The French farmer sits down on the stump he was previously chopping away at, pulls a handkerchief from his pocket, wipes sweat from his face, and waits for the Nazi convoy to arrive. After living for a year with the sword of Damocles suspended over his head, this may very well be the end.
Julie finishes filling the water basin and places it on the windowsill.
JULIE
Ready, Pappa.
FARMER
Thank you, darling, now go inside and take care of your mother. Don’t run.
Julie walks inside the farmhouse and closes the door behind her.
As her father stands up from the stump and moves over to the windowsill with the water basin . . .
. . . The SOUND OF THE ENGINES of the two motorcycles and car get LOUDER.
The farmer SPLASHES water from the basin on his face and down his front. He takes a towel off a nail and wipes the excess water from his face and chest, as he watches the two motorcycles, the one automobile, and the four representatives of the National Socialist Party come to a halt on his property.
We don’t move into them but keep observing them from a distance, like the farmer.
The TWO NAZI MOTORCYCLISTS are off their bikes and standing at attention next to them.
The NAZI DRIVER has walked around the automobile and opened the door for his superior.
The NAZI OFFICER says to the driver in UNSUBTITLED GERMAN:
NAZI OFFICER
This is the property of Perrier LaPadite?
NAZI DRIVER
Yes, Herr Colonel.
The Nazi officer climbs out of the backseat of the vehicle, carrying in his left hand a black leather attaché case.
NAZI OFFICER
Herrman, until I summon you, I am to be left alone.
NAZI DRIVER
As you wish, Herr Colonel.
The S.S. colonel yells to the farmer in FRENCH, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:
NAZI OFFICER
Is this the property of Perrier LaPadite?
FARMER
I am Perrier LaPadite.
The S.S. colonel crosses the distance between them with long strides and says, in French, with a smile on his face:
NAZI OFFICER
It is a pleasure to meet you, Monsieur
LaPadite. I am Colonel Hans Landa of
the S.S.
COL. HANS LANDA offers the French farmer, PERRIER LAPADITE, his hand. The Frenchman takes the German hand in his and shakes it.
PERRIER
How may I help you?
COL. LANDA
I was hoping you could invite me inside your home and we may have a discussion.
INT—LAPADITE FARMHOUSE—DAY
The door to the farmhouse swings open, and the farmer gestures for the S.S. colonel to enter. Removing his gray S.S. cap, the German steps inside the Frenchman’s home.
Col. Landa is immediately greeted with the sight of the farmer’s wife and three pretty daughters standing together in the kitchen, smiling in his direction.
The farmer enters behind him, closing the door.
PERRIER
Colonel Landa, this is my family.
The S.S. colonel clicks his heels together and takes the hand of the French farmer’s wife . . .
COL. LANDA
Col. Hans Landa of the S.S., Madame,
at your service.
He kisses her hand, then continues without letting go of his hostess’s hand . . .
COL. LANDA
Please excuse my rude intrusion on your
routine.
FARMER’S WIFE
Don’t be ridiculous, Herr Colonel.
While still holding the French woman’s hand and looking into her eyes, the S.S. colonel says:
COL. LANDA
Monsieur LaPadite, the rumors I have heard in the village about your family are all true. Your wife is a beautiful woman.
His eyes leave the mother and move to the three daughters.
COL. LANDA
(CON’T)
And each of your daughters is more lovely than the last.
PERRIER
Merci. Please have a seat.
The farmer offers the S.S. colonel a seat at the family’s wooden dinner table. The Nazi officer accepts the French farmer’s offer and lowers himself into the chair, placing his gray S.S. cap on the table and keeping his black attaché case on the floor by his feet.
The farmer (perfect host) turns to his wife and says:
PERRIER
Charlotte, would you be so good as to get the
Colonel some wine?
COL. LANDA
Merci beaucoup, Monsieur LaPadite, but no wine. This being a dairy farm, one would be safe in assuming you have milk?
CHARLOTTE
Oui.
COL. LANDA
Then milk is what I prefer.
CHARLOTTE
Very well.
The mother of three takes a carafe of milk out of the icebox
and pours a tall glass of the fresh white liquid for the colonel.
The S.S. colonel takes a long drink from the glass, then puts it down LOUDLY on the wooden table.
COL. LANDA
Monsieur, to both your family and your cows I say: Bravo.
PERRIER
Merci.
COL. LANDA
Please, join me at your table.
PERRIER
Very well.
The French farmer sits at his wooden dinner table across from the Nazi.
The women remain standing.
Col. Landa leans forward and says to the farmer in a low tone of confidentiality:
COL. LANDA
Monsieur LaPadite, what we have to discuss would be better discussed in private. You’ll notice, I left my men outdoors. If it wouldn’t offend them, could you ask your lovely ladies to step outside?
PERRIER
You are right.
PERRIER
(to his women)
Charlotte, would you take the girls outside.
The Colonel and I need to have a few words.
The farmer’s wife follows her husband’s orders and gathers her daughters, taking them outside, closing the door behind them.
The two men are alone at the farmer’s dinner table, in the farmer’s humble home.
COL. LANDA
Monsieur LaPadite, I regret to inform you I’ve exhausted the extent of my French. To continue to speak it so inadequately would only serve to embarrass me. However, I’ve been led
to believe you speak English quite well?
PERRIER
Oui.
COL. LANDA
Well, it just so happens, I do as well. This being your house, I ask your permission to switch to English for the remainder of the conversation.
PERRIER
By all means.
They now speak ENGLISH:
COL. LANDA
Monsieur LaPadite, while I’m very familiar with you and your family,
I have no way of knowing if you are familiar with who I am. Are you aware of my existence?
The farmer answers:
PERRIER
Yes.
COL. LANDA
This is good. Are you aware of the job I’ve been ordered to carry out in France?
PERRIER
Yes.
The colonel drinks more milk.
COL. LANDA
Please tell me what you’ve heard?
PERRIER
I’ve heard the Führer has put you in charge of rounding up the Jews left in France who are either hiding or passing for gentile.
The S.S. colonel smiles.
COL. LANDA
The Führer couldn’t have said it better
himself.
PERRIER
But the meaning of your visit, pleasant though it is, is mysterious to me.
The Germans looked through my house nine months ago for hiding Jews and found nothing.
COL. LANDA
I’m aware of that. I read the report on this area. But like any enterprise,
when under new management, there’s always a slight duplication of efforts. Most of it being a complete waste of time, but it needs to be done nevertheless.
I just have a few questions, Monsieur LaPadite. If you can assist me with answers, my department can close the
file on your family.
Taking his black leather attaché case and placing it on the table, he takes out a folder from inside. He also extracts an expensive black fountain pen from his uniform’s front pocket. Opening the folder and referring to it:
COL. LANDA
Now, before the occupation there were four Jewish families in this area, all dairy farmers like yourself:
the Loveitts, the Doleracs, the Rollins, and the Dreyfuses, is that correct?
PERRIER
To my knowledge those were the Jewish families among the dairy farmers.
Herr Colonel, would it disturb you if
I smoked my pipe?
Looking up from his papers:
COL. LANDA
Please, Monsieur LaPadite, it is your house.
Make yourself comfortable.
The farmer gets up from the table, goes to a shelf over the fireplace, and removes from it a WOODEN BOX that contains all the fixings to his pipe. He sits back down at the table with his Nazi guest.
As the farmer loads the bowl of his pipe with tobacco, sets a match to it, and begins slowly puffing, making it red hot, the S.S. colonel studies the papers in front of him.
COL. LANDA
Now, according to these papers, all
the Jewish families in this area have been accounted for— except the Dreyfuses. Somewhere in the last year it would appear they have vanished.
Which leads me to the conclusion that they’ve either made good their escape
or someone is very successful hiding them.
(looking up from
his papers, across
the table at the
farmer)
What have you heard about the Dreyfuses, Monsieur LaPadite?
PERRIER
Only rumors—
COL. LANDA
—I love rumors! Facts can be so misleading, where rumors, true or false, are often revealing. So, Monsieur LaPadite, what rumors have you heard regarding
the Dreyfuses?
The farmer looks at Landa.
COL. LANDA
Speak freely, Monsieur LaPadite, I want to hear what the rumors are, not who told them to you.
The farmer puffs thoroughly on his pipe.
PERRIER
Again, this is just a rumor—but we
heard the Dreyfuses had made their way into Spain.
COL. LANDA
So the rumors you’ve heard have been of escape?
PERRIER
Yes.
COL. LANDA
Were the LaPadites and the Dreyfuses friendly?
As the farmer answers this question, the CAMERA LOWERS behind his chair, to the floor, past the floor, to a small area underneath the floorboards, revealing:
FIVE HUMAN BEINGS
lying horizontally underneath the farmer’s floorboards. These human beings are the DREYFUSES, who have lived lying down underneath the dairy farmer’s house for the past year. But one couldn’t call what the Dreyfuses have done for the last year living. This family has done the only thing they could—hide from an occupying army that wishes to exterminate them.
PERRIER
We were families in the same community, in the same business. I wouldn’t say
we were friends, but members of the same community. We had common interests.
The S.S. colonel takes in this answer, seems to accept it, then moves to the next question.
COL. LANDA
Having never met the Dreyfuses, would you confirm for me the exact members of the household and their names?
PERRIER
There were five of them.
The father, Jacob . . . wife, Miriam . . . her brother, Bob . . .
COL. LANDA
—How old is Bob?
PERRIER
Thirty—thirty-one?
COL. LANDA
Continue.
PERRIER
And the children . . . Amos . . . and Shosanna.
COL. LANDA
Ages of the children?
PERRIER
Amos—six—I believe. And Shosanna
was fifteen or sixteen, I’m not really sure.
CUT TO
EXT—DAIRY FARM—DAY
The mother and her three daughters finish taking the laundry off the clothesline.
They can’t hear anything going on inside.
The three Nazi soldiers watch the three daughters.
BACK TO LANDA AND PERRIER
COL. LANDA
Well, I guess that should do it.
He begins gathering up his papers and putting them back into his attaché case.
The farmer, cool as a cucumber, puffs on his pipe.
COL. LANDA
However, before I go, could I have another glass of your delicious milk?
PERRIER
But of course.
The farmer stands up, goes over to the icebox, and takes out the carafe of milk. As he walks over and fills the Nazi colonel’s glass, the German officer talks.
COL. LANDA
Monsieur LaPadite, are you aware of the nickname the people of France have given me?
PERRIER
I have no interest in such things.
COL. LANDA
But you are aware of what they call me?
PERRIER
I’m aware.
COL. LANDA
What are you aware of?
PERRIER
That they call you “the Jew Hunter.”
COL. LANDA
Precisely! Now I understand your trepidation in repeating it.
Before he was assassinated, Heydrich
apparently hated the moniker the good people of Prague bestowed on him. Actually, why he would hate the name “the Hangman” is baffling to me. It would appear he did everything in
his power to earn it. But I, on the other hand, love my unofficial title, precisely because I’ve earned it.
As “the Jew Hunter” enjoys his fresh milk, he continues to theorize with the French farmer.
COL. LANDA
The feature that makes me such an	effective
hunter	of the Jews is, as opposed	to most German
soldiers, I can	think like a Jew,	where they can
only think like			precisely, a
a German or, more
German	soldier.
Now if	one were	to determine what	attribute the
German	people share with a beast,	it would be the
cunning and predatory instinct of	a hawk.
COL. LANDA
(CON’T)
Negroes—gorillas—brain—lips—smell—physical strength—penis size.
But if one were to determine what attributes the Jews share with a beast, it would be that of the rat.
Now the Führer and Goebbels’s propaganda have said pretty much the same thing. Where our conclusions differ is I don’t consider the comparison an insult. Consider for a moment the world a rat lives in. It’s a hostile world indeed. If a rat were to scamper through your front door right now, would you greet it with hostility?
PERRIER
I suppose I would.
COL. LANDA
Has a rat ever done anything to you to create this animosity you feel toward them?
PERRIER
Rats spread disease, they bite people—
COL. LANDA
Unless some fool is stupid enough to
try and handle a live one, rats don’t make it a practice of biting human beings. Rats were the cause of the bubonic plague, but that was some time ago. In all your born days, has a rat ever caused you to be sick a day in your life? I propose to you, any disease a rat could spread a squirrel would equally carry.
Yet I assume you don’t share the same animosity with squirrels that you do with rats, do you?
PERRIER
No.
COL. LANDA
Yet they are both rodents, are they
not? And except for the fact that one has a big bushy tail, while the other has a long repugnant tail of rodent skin, they even rather look alike, don’t they?
PERRIER
It is an interesting thought,
Herr Colonel.
COL. LANDA
However, interesting as the thought may be, it makes not one bit of difference to how you feel. If a rat were to scamper through your door this very minute, would you offer it a saucer of your delicious milk?
PERRIER
Probably not.
COL. LANDA
I didn’t think so. You don’t like them. You don’t really know why you don’t like them. All you know is, you find them repulsive.
(lets the
metaphor
sink in)
What a tremendously hostile world a rat must endure. Yet not only does he survive, he thrives. And the reason for this is because our little foe has an instinct for survival and preservation second to none. And that, Monsieur, is what a Jew shares with a rat.
Consequently, a German soldier conducts
a search of a house suspected of hiding Jews. Where does the hawk look? He looks in the barn, he looks in the attic,
he looks in the cellar—he looks everywhere he would hide. But there are many places it would never occur to a hawk to hide. However, the reason the Führer brought me off my Alps in Austria and placed me in French cow country today is because it does occur to me.
Because I’m aware what tremendous feats human beings are capable of once they abandon dignity.
(changing tone)
May I smoke my pipe as well?
The farmer’s cool facade is little by little eroding.
PERRIER
Please, colonel, make yourself at home.
The Jew Hunter removes both a pipe and a bag of tobacco fixings. The pipe, strangely enough, is a calabash, made from an S-shaped gourd with a yellow skin and made famous by Sherlock Holmes.
As the Nazi colonel busies himself with his smoking, he continues to hold court at the Frenchman’s table.
COL. LANDA
The other mistake the German soldiers
make is their severe handling of the
citizens who give shelter and aid to
the Jews. These citizens are not enemies
of the state. They are simply confused
people, trying to make some sense out of
the madness war creates.
These citizens do not need punishing. They simply need to be reminded of their duty in wartime.
Let’s use you as a example, Monsieur
LaPadite. In this war, you have found
yourself in the middle of a conflict
that has nothing to do with yourself,
your lovely ladies, or your cows—yet
here you are.
So, Monsieur LaPadite, let me propose
a question. In this time of war, what is your number-one duty? Is it to fight
the Germans in the name of France to your last breath? Or is it to harass the occupying army to the best of your
ability? Or is it to protect the poor, unfortunate victims of warfare who can
not protect themselves?
Or is your number-one duty in this time
of bloodshed to protect those very
beautiful women who constitute your
family?
The Colonel lets the last statement stand.
COL. LANDA
That was a question, Monsieur LaPadite. In this time of war, what do you consider your number-one duty?
PERRIER
To protect my family.
COL. LANDA
Now, my job dictates that I must have
my men enter your home and conduct a thorough search before I can officially cross your family’s name off my list.
COL. LANDA
(CON’T)
And if there are any irregularities to be found, rest assured, they will be.
That is, unless you have something to tell me that will make the conducting of a search unnecessary.
(pause)
I might add also that any information
that makes the performing of my duty
easier will not be met with punishment.
Actually quite the contrary, it will be
met with reward.
And that reward will be your family
will cease to be harassed in any way
by the German military during the rest of our occupation of your country.
The farmer, pipe in mouth, stares across the table at his German opponent.
COL. LANDA
You are sheltering enemies of the state, are you not?
PERRIER
Yes.
COL. LANDA
You’re sheltering them underneath your
floorboards, aren’t you?
PERRIER
Yes.
COL. LANDA
Point out to me the areas where they’re hiding.
The farmer points out the areas on the floor where the Dreyfuses are underneath.
COL. LANDA
Since I haven’t heard any disturbance,
I assume that while they’re listening, they don’t speak English?
PERRIER
Yes.
COL. LANDA
I’m going to switch back to French now, and I want you to follow my masquerade—is that clear?
PERRIER
Yes.
Col. Landa stands up from the table and, switching to FRENCH, says,
SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:
COL. LANDA
Monsieur LaPadite, I thank you for your milk and your hospitality. I do believe our business here is done.
The Nazi officer opens the front door and silently motions for his men to approach the house.
COL. LANDA
Madame LaPadite, I thank you for your time. We shan’t be bothering your family any longer.
The soldiers enter the doorway. Col. Landa silently points out the area of the floor the Jews are hiding under.
COL. LANDA
So, Monsieur and Madame LaPadite,
I bid you adieu.
He motions to the soldiers with his index finger.
They TEAR UP the wooden floor with MACHINE-GUN FIRE.
The little farmhouse is filled with SMOKE, DUST, SPLINTERS, SCREAMS, BULLET CASINGS, and even a little BLOOD.
With a hand motion from the colonel, the soldiers cut off their gunfire. The colonel keeps his finger in the air to indicate silence.
UNDERNEATH THE FLOORBOARDS
The entire Dreyfus family lies dead. Except for sixteen-year-old SHOSANNA, who miraculously escaped being struck by the Nazis’ bullets. With her dead family surrounding her, the young girl goes for freedom (represented by a wire-mesh vent).
COL. LANDA
hears a movement underneath the floor, looks down, and sees a SHAPE moving forward between the planks in the floor.
COL. LANDA
It’s the girl. Nobody move!
VENT
is KICKED open, the girl SPRINGS out.
COL. LANDA
as he crosses the floor, sees the young girl RUNNING toward the cover of the woods. He unlatches the window and opens it. Shosanna is perfectly FRAMED in the windowsill.

COL. LANDA
changes his mind. He yells to the rat fleeing the trap, heading for the safety of the woodpile, in FRENCH SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:
COL. LANDA
Au revoir, Shosanna!
SHOSANNA
makes it to the woods and is gone.
The S.S. colonel closes the window.
EXT—DAIRY FARM—DAY
The Nazi town car DRIVES away.
EXT—NAZI TOWN CAR (MOVING)—DAY
Col. Hans Landa sits in the backseat of the convertible that’s speeding away from the French farmhouse.
Landa speaks to his driver in GERMAN, SUBTITLE IN ENGLISH:
COL. LANDA
Herrman, I sense a question on your lips?
Out with it?
DRIVER
Why did you allow an enemy of the state to escape?
COL. LANDA
Oh, I don’t think the state is in too much danger, do you?
DRIVER
I suppose not.
COL. LANDA
I’m glad you see it my way. Besides,
not putting a bullet in the back of a fifteen-year-old girl and allowing
her to escape are not necessarily
the same thing. She’s a young girl, no food, no shelter, no shoes, who’s just witnessed the massacre of her entire family.
She may not survive the night. And after word spreads about what happened today, it’s highly unlikely she will find any willing farmers to extend her aid.
If I had to guess her fate, I’d say she’ll probably be turned in by some neighbor.
Or she’ll be spotted by some German soldier. Or we’ll find her body in the woods, dead from starvation or exposure. Or, perhaps . . . she’ll survive. She will elude capture. She will escape to America. She will move to New York City, where she will be elected President of the United States.
The S.S. colonel chuckles at his little funny.
FADE UP
CHAPTER TITLE APPEARS:
CHAPTER TWO
“INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS”
FADE UP
EXT—SOMEWHERE IN ENGLAND—DAY
A bunch of SOLDIERS are lined up at attention.
LIEUTENANT ALDO RAINE, a hillbilly from the mountains of Tennessee, walks down the line. He recruits the men the
Germans will later call “The Basterds.” Lt. Aldo has one defining physical characteristic, a ROPE BURN around his neck—as if, once upon a time, he survived a LYNCHING.
The scar will never once be mentioned.
LT. ALDO
My name is Lt. Aldo Raine, and I’m puttin’ together a special team.
And I need me eight soldiers.
Eight—Jewish—American—soldiers.
Now y’all might of heard rumors
about the armada happening soon.
Well, we’ll be leavin’ a little
earlier. We’re gonna be dropped
into France, dressed as civilians.
And once we’re in enemy territory, as
a bushwackin’, guerrilla army, we’re gonna be doin’ one thing, and one thing only—Killin’ Nazis.
The members of the National Socialist Party have conquered Europe through murder, torture, intimidation, and terror. And that’s exactly what we’re gonna do to them. Now I don’t know ’bout y’all? But I sure as hell didn’t come down from the goddamn Smoky Mountains, cross five thousand miles
of water, fight my way through half Sicily, and then jump out of a fuckin’ air-o-plane to teach the Nazis
lessons in humanity. Nazi ain’t got
no humanity. They’re the foot soldiers of a Jew-hatin’, mass-murderin’ maniac, and they need to be destroyed.
That’s why any and every son-of-a-bitch we find wearin’ a Nazi uniform, they’re gonna die.
LT. ALDO
(CON’T)
We will be cruel to the Germans,
and through our cruelty, they will
know who we are. They will find the evidence of our cruelty in the disemboweled, dismembered, and
disfigured bodies of their brothers
we leave behind us. And the Germans
will not be able to help themselves
from imagining the cruelty their brothers
endured at our hands, and
our bootheels, and the edge of our knives.
And the Germans will be sickened by us. And the Germans will talk about us.
And the Germans will fear us.
And when the Germans close their eyes at night and their subconscious
tortures them for the evil they’ve done, it will be thoughts of us
that it tortures them with.
He stops pacing and looks at everybody.
LT. ALDO
Sound good?
They all say:
ALL
Yes, sir!
LT. ALDO
That’s what I like to hear. But I
got a word of warning to all would-be warriors.
When you join my command,
you take on debit. A debit you owe
me, personally. Every man under my command owes me one hundred Nazi scalps. And I want my scalps.
And all y’all will git me one hundred
Nazi scalps, taken from the heads of
one hundred dead Nazis . . .
or you will die trying.

“BAVARIA
BERCHTESGADEN
(HITLER’S PRIVATE LAIR)”
INT—BERCHTESGADEN—DAY
In a huge room, ADOLF HITLER pounds on a big table with his fist as he rants at TWO GERMAN GENERALS.
They speak GERMAN SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:
HITLER
How much more of these Jew swine
must I endure? They butcher my men
like they were fish bait! This pack
of filthy degenerates are doing what
the Russian army didn’t and Patton’s army couldn’t—turning soldiers of
the Third Reich into superstitious
old women!
GERMAN GENERAL
Just the cowards among them, mein Führer.
Hitler pounds furiously on the desk with his fist.
HITLER
No, no, no, no, no, no! I have heard
the rumors myself! Soldiers of the Third Reich, who have brought the world to their knees, now pecking and clucking like chickens. Do you know the latest rumor they’ve conjured up, in their fear-induced delirium? The one that beats
my boys with a bat. The one they call “the Bear Jew” . . . is a golem.
An avenging Jew angel, conjured up by
a vengeful rabbi, to smite the Aryans!
GENERAL
Mein Führer, this is just soldiers’ gossip. No one really believes the
Bear Jew is a golem.
HITLER
Why not? They seem to be able to elude capture like an apparition.
They seem to be able to appear and disappear at will.
HITLER
(CON’T)
You want to prove they’re flesh and blood? Then
BRING THEM TO ME!
I will hang them naked, by their
heels, from the Eiffel Tower!
And then throw their bodies in
the sewers, for the rats of Paris
to feast!
The Führer sits down at the table to compose himself and wipe his greasy black hair out of his face.
HITLER
(disgusted)
The Bear Jew.
He hits the button on the intercom on his desk.
HITLER
Kliest!
KLIEST’S VOICE comes out of the intercom:
KLIEST’S VOICE (OS)
Yes, mein Führer.
HITLER
I have an order I want relayed to all German soldiers stationed in France.
The Jew degenerate known as the Bear
Jew henceforth is never to be
referred to as the Bear Jew again.
We will cease to aid the Americans
any longer in their attempt to
undermine the German soldier’s psyche. Did you get that, Kliest?
KLIEST’S VOICE (OS)
Yes, mein Führer. Do you still wish
to see Private Butz?
HITLER
Who and what is a private Butz?
KLEIST’S VOICE (OS)
He’s the soldier you wanted to see personally.
His squad was ambushed
by Lt. Raine’s Jews. He was its only survivor.
HITLER
Indeed I do want to see him. Thank
you for reminding me. Send him in.

His head lies on the ground, horizontal. A HAND reaches into

This process is called SCALPING.
After SLICING is complete, the SCALP easily peels off, like a banana skin.

rings, weapons, an iron cross, and somebody digging out a gold tooth with a knife, being removed from dead Germans.
PVT. BUTZ (VO)
. . . They also took their identification papers . . .

. . . They then removed their boots . . .
CU GERMAN COMBAT BOOTS

DEAD GERMANS
scalps removed from their heads, pink bare feet . . .
PVT. BUTZ (VO)
The Basterds took their lives, their hair, their valuables, their identity, and finally their dignity in death.
True that. The sight of the dead soldiers with bare feet does rob the tableau of a certain dignity that is normally felt in battlefield shots.
BACK TO HITLER
HITLER
The dogs!
He fights his frustration, then . . .
HITLER
Continue.
BACK TO THE BASTERDS
Aldo screams to the Basterd who’s guarding the two German prisoners.
LT. ALDO
Hey, Hirschberg, send that kraut
sarge over.
BASTERD PFC. HIRSCHBERG
KICKS Sgt. Rachtman in the back.
PFC. HIRSCHBERG
You! Go!
Sgt. Rachtman is a little slow to respond. So Hirschberg grabs him by the hair, YANKS him to his feet, and KICKS him in the ass, sending him on his way.
Most of the Basterds sit in a circle, Indian style, with Aldo in the middle.
As Sgt. Rachtman walks toward this circle of Basterds,
An OFFSCREEN LITERARY NARRATOR (not Pvt. Butz) speaks over the SOUNDTRACK in ENGLISH:
NARRATOR (VO)
Sergeant Werner Rachtman has seen many
interrogations since Germany decided
it should rule Europe. But this is
the first time he’s ever been on the
wrong end of the exchange.
It’s always been his belief that
only a weakling in mind, body, and spirit
complies with the enemy under threat of consequence.
As Werner watched men cry like women,
pleadingly offer their knowledge, in
exchange for their worthless lives,
he made a vow to himself.
If his role is to die in this conflict,
when they put him under the earth,
his dignity would be buried with him.
For in the other world, the gods only
respect the ones they test first.
Well, Sergeant, this is your test.
And the gods are watching.
The captured German sergeant enters the circle of Basterds, stands straight before the sitting southern lieutenant, and salutes his captor.
SGT. RACHTMAN
(ENGLISH)
Sgt. Werner Rachtman.
Aldo returns the salute, looking at up him.
LT. ALDO
Lt. Aldo Raine. Pleased to meet cha.
You know what sit down means, Werner?
SGT. RACHTMAN
Yes.
LT. ALDO
Then sit down.
The German sergeant does.
LT. ALDO
How’s your English, Werner? Cause if need be,
we gotta couple fellas
can translate.
Aldo points at one of the Basterds in the circle, CPL. WILHELM WICKI.
LT. ALDO
Wicki there, an Austrian Jew, got the fuck outta Salzberg while the
gettin’ was good. Became American,
got drafted, and came back to give
y’all what for.
Then Aldo points to another Basterd. A big, scary-looking Basterd, in a German sergeant’s uniform, named SGT. HUGO STIGLITZ.
LT. ALDO
And another one over there you
might be familiar with, Sgt. Hugo Stiglitz.
Heard of ’em?
The two German sergeants look at each other.
SGT. RACHTMAN
Everybody in the German army’s heard
of Hugo Stiglitz.
The Basterds laugh, and a couple pat Hugo on the back.
The NARRATOR comes back on the SOUNDTRACK.
NARRATOR (VO)
The reason for Hugo Stiglitz’s
celebrity among German soldiers
is simple.
WE SEE A PHOTO OF HUGO on the front page of the Nazi version of Stars and Stripes (the military newspaper).
NARRATOR (VO)
As a German enlisted man, he killed thirteen Gestapo officers, mostly majors.
WE SEE THE MILITARY PHOTOS OF ALL THIRTEEN GESTAPO OFFICERS.
NARRATOR (VO)
Instead of putting him up against
a wall, the High Command decided to
send him back to Berlin, to be made
an example of.
Hugo in chains, being put in a lone troop truck, part of a prison convoy, en route to Berlin.
NARRATOR (VO)
Needless to say, once the Basterds
heard about him, he never got there.
EXT—FRENCH COUNTRYSIDE—DAY
The Basterds AMBUSH the prison convoy, killing everybody.
They walk to the back of the troop truck. Inside, Hugo, in chains, stares back at them.
LT. ALDO
Sgt. Hugo Stiglitz?
Hugo nods.
LT. ALDO
I’m Lt. Aldo Raine, and these are
the Basterds. Ever heard of us?
Hugo nods his head, yes.
LT. ALDO
We just wanna say, we’re a big fan of your work. When it comes to killin’ Nazis, I think you show great talent, and I pride myself on havin’ an eye for that kind of talent. But your status as a Nazi killer is still amateur. We all came here to see if you wanna go pro?
BACK TO THE BASTERD CIRCLE.
LT. ALDO
Now Werner, I’m gonna assume you know who we are?
SGT. RACHTMAN
Aldo the Apache.
The circle of Basterds giggle.
LT. ADLO
Well, Werner, if you heard of us, you probably heard we ain’t in the
prisoner-takin’ business. We in the killin’ Nazi business. And cousin, business is boomin’.
The Basterds laugh.
