LT. ALDO
Now that leaves two ways we can play this out.
Either kill ya or let ya
go. Now whether or not you gonna
leave this circle alive depends
entirely on you.
Aldo takes out a map of the area and lays it out in front of his prisoner.
LT. ALDO
Up the road a piece, there’s a
orchard. ’Sides you, we know there’s another kraut patrol fuckin’ around
here somewhere. Now if that patrol
were to have any crack shots, that orchard would be a goddamn sniper’s delight. Now if you ever wanna eat
a sauerkraut sandwich again, you
gotta show me on this map where
they are, you gotta tell me how many they are, and you gotta tell me
what kinda artillery they carrying
with ’em.
SGT. RACHTMAN
You can’t expect me to divulge information that would put German
lives in danger.
LT. ALDO
Well, Werner, that’s where you’re wrong.
Because that’s exactly what I expect.
I need to know about Germans hidin’
in trees. And you need to tell me.
And you need to tell me, right now.
Now take your finger and point out
on this map where this party’s bein’ held, how many’s comin’, and what they brought to play with.
Werner sits, head held high, back straight, chin up, every inch the German hero facing death.
SGT. WERNER
I respectfully refuse, sir.
Aldo jerks his thumb behind him.
LT. ALDO
You see that ole boy battin’ rocks?
WE RACK-FOCUS to one of the Basterds not in the circle. He’s wearing a wife beater and power-hitting stones with a baseball bat.
Werner’s eyes go to the ballplayer.
LT. ALDO
That’s Sgt. Donny Donowitz. But you might know him better by his nickname, the Bear Jew. Now if you heard of
Aldo the Apache, you gotta heard about the Bear Jew?
SGT. RACHTMAN
I heard.
LT. ALDO
What did you hear?
SGT. RACHTMAN
He beats German soldiers with a club.
LT. ALDO
He bashes their brains in with a baseball bat, what he does.
SGT. DONOWITZ
back to us, still haven’t seen his face. He Babe Ruths a rock soaring into the atmosphere.
LT. ALDO
Now, Werner, I’m gonna ask you one last goddamn time, and if you still “respectfully refuse,” I’m calling the Bear Jew over here, and he’s gonna take that big bat of his, and he’s gonna beat your ass to death with it.
Now take your Wiener-schnitzel-lickin’ finger and point out on this map
what I want to know.
SGT. RACHTMAN
Fuck you and your Jew dogs.
Instead of getting mad, the Basterds burst out LAUGHING.
Also says to Werner, with a giggle in his voice:
LT. ALDO
Actually, Werner, we’re all tickled
ya said that. Frankly, watchin’ Donny beat Nazis to death is the closest
we ever get to goin’ to the movies.
(YELLING)
DONNY!
SGT. DONOWITZ
He turns to the CAMERA and yells:
SGT. DONOWITZ
Yeah?
LT. ALDO
Got a German here wants to die for his country.
Oblige him.
SGT. DONNY DONOWITZ
bat over his shoulder, smiles.
CUT TO
INT—BARBER SHOP (BOSTON)—DAY
Donny, cutting heads, in his pop’s barber shop, in Boston.
DONNY
. . . ya got the goddamn, fuckin’ Germans,
declaring open season on Jews in
Europe, and I’m suppose to fly to the fuckin’
Philippines and fight a bunch
of fuckin’ Japs—not me, pal.
If we just go in this against the Japs,
the whole U.S. of fuckin A can go take a
running jump at the moon.
HEAD
You know, they got a word for what you’re sayin’ Donny. It’s called treason.
DONNY
Hey, stick your treason up your poop hole. If I’m gonna kill my fellow man
in the name of liberty, that fellow
man will be German.
INT—SPORTING GOODS STORE—DAY
MR. GOOROWITZ’S sporting goods shop in Donny’s Jewish Boston neighborhood. Donny walks in.
MR. GOOROWITZ
Hello, Donny. How are you?
DONNY
Ah, just dandy, Mr. Goorowitz.
MR. GOOROWITZ
Your mother, your father—everything
good there?
DONNY
They’re just fine. I’m shippin’ off next week.
The store proprietor extends his hand to the young man.
MR. GOOROWITZ
Good for you, son. Kill one of those Nazi basterds for me, will ya?
DONNY
That the idea, Mr. Goorowitz.
MR. GOOROWITZ
What can I do you for, Donny?
DONNY
I need a baseball bat.
The store owner leads him to a basket with eight bats in it. Donny starts going through them without saying anything.
Mr. Goorowitz watches.
MR. GOOROWITZ
You gettin’ your little brother a present before you ship out?
Donny, concentrating on the bats, not looking up:
DONNY
No.
Donny’s “no” silences the gabby Goorowitz. He seems to settle on one, feeling its weight in his hands.
DONNY
Can I try this one on for size, outside?
Extending his arm:
MR. GOOROWITZ
Be my guest.
The phone rings.
MR. GOOROWITZ
I’ll get that. You go right ahead.
The proprietor answers the phone and gets into a conversation with his OFFSCREEN mother.
Donny walks outside. WE STAY IN STORE but can see him clearly through the store’s big picture window.
However, Mr. Goorowitz instinctively turns his back to Donny to speak with his mother.
Donny starts swinging the bat. It’s pretty obvious he’s pantomiming beating somebody to death with it. Then
he starts yelling:
DONNY
Take that, ya Nazi basterd! You like
fuckin’ with the Jews? Wanna fuck with the Jews? The American Jews are gonna FUCK with you . . . !
Mr. Goorowitz sees none of this as he speaks to his
mother. He hangs up the phone just as Donny walks back into the store. The store owner turns to the store customer.
DONNY
Is this the heaviest ya got?
CUT TO
INT—HALLWAY APARTMENT BUILDING—DAY
Donny, dressed nice, in an apartment building in his Jewish Boston neighbourhood. He knocks on a door.
A VERY OLD JEWISH WOMAN opens the door, only a little, peering out at the young man.
OLD WOMAN
How can I help you?
DONNY
Mrs. Himmelstein?
MRS. HIMMELSTEIN
State your business, young man.
DONNY
Mrs. Himmelstein, I’m Donny Donowitz.
My father, Sy Donowitz, owns the barber shop on
Greeny Ave. Sy’s Barber Shop.
MRS. HIMMELSTEIN
I’ve seen it. Do you live in the neighborhood?
DONNY
All my life.
MRS. HIMMELSTEIN
Again, state your business?
DONNY
May I have a word with you?
MRS. HIMMELSTEIN
What about?
DONNY
Our people in Europe.
She thinks for a beat, then holds the door open for the young man.
MRS. HIMMELSTEIN
Come in. Would you like some tea?
INT—MRS. HIMMELSTEIN’S APARTMENT—DAY
Donny sits on an overstuffed sofa, holding a tea cup and
saucer in his hand. Mrs. Himmelstein sits on an overstuffed chair, holding her tea, looking across at her visitor.
DONNY
(sipping tea)
Very good.
MRS. HIMMSELSTEIN
If you like tea.
Donny chuckles at her little joke. The old woman remains
stone. She wasn’t joking. He places his saucer on the coffee table and begins:
DONNY
Mrs. Himmelstein, do you have any loved ones over in Europe who you’re concerned for?
MRS. HIMMELSTEIN
What compels you, young man, to ask a stranger such a personal question?
DONNY
Because I’m going to Europe. And I’m gonna make it right.
MRS. HIMMELSTEIN
And just how do intend to do that, Joshua?
He holds up his bat.
DONNY
With this.
MRS. HIMMELSTEIN
And what exactly do you intend to do with that toy?
DONNY
I’m gonna beat every Nazi I find to
death with it.
She takes another sip of tea.
MRS. HIMMELSTEIN
I thought we were having tea together.
Donny picks up his cup and takes a sip.
MRS. HIMMELSTEIN
And in this pursuit, how is it that I can be of service?
DONNY
I’m going through the neighborhood.
If you have any loved ones in Europe whose safety you fear for, I’d like
you to write their name on my bat.
BACK TO BASTERDS
Donna takes a long walk to Werner . . .
PVT. BUTZ
watches all this . . .
As WE CUT BACK and FORTH BETWEEN DONNY WALKING and WERNER WAITING, WE ALSO CUT BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN DONNY and
MRS. HIMMELSTEIN . . .
MRS. HIMMELSTEIN
You must be a real basterd, Donny.
DONNY
You bet your sweet ass I am.
MRS. HIMMELSTEIN
Hand me your sword, Gideon. I do believe I will join you on this journey.
She signs the BAT: “MADELEINE.”
Donny steps up to the plate, looking down at the Nazi:
He sees the Iron Cross hanging from the German Sgt’s right pocket.
The Jew taps the German’s medal with the end of his bat.
DONNY
You get that for killing jews?
SGT RACHTMAN
Bravery.
Donny gives him a “oh yeah, we’ll see about that,” look.
The Bear Jew raises the bat up high over his shoulder and brings it down hard against the side of Rachtman’s head.
Donny BEATS Werner TO DEATH WITH THE BAT, to the cheers of the Basterds.
PVT. BUTZ
watches. Hirschberg says to him:
PFC. HIRSCHBERG
About now, I’d be shittin’ my pants, if I was you.
Aldo points a finger at Butzs and crooks it toward him.
A crying, visibly shaken Butz sits down in front of Aldo.
LT. ALDO
You wanna live?
PVT. BUTZ
Yes, sir.
LT. ALDO
Point out on this map the German position.
His arm shoots out like a rocket and points out the positions.
PVT. BUTZ
This area here.
LT. ALDO
How many?
PVT. BUTZ
Maybe twelve.
LT. ALDO
What kind of artillery?
PVT BUTZ
They have a machine gun dug in here pointing north.
BACK TO HITLER
HITLER
How did you survive this ordeal?
WE SEE Pvt. Butz in the Führer’s room for the first time.
He wears a Nazi cap, which is unusual in the presence of the Führer, but he seems okay with it.
PVT. BUTZ
They let me go.
FROM HERE ON WE GO BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN ALDO AND HITLER.
LT. ALDO
Now, when you report what happened here,
you can’t tell ’em you told us what you
told us. They’ll shoot ya. But they’re gonna
wanna know, why you so special, we let you
live? So tell ’em we let ya live so you
could spread the word through the ranks
what’s gonna happen to every Nazi we find.
HITLER
You are not to tell anybody anything! Not one word of detail! Your outfit
was ambushed, and you got away.
Not one more word.
PVT. BUTZ
Yes, mein Führer.
Pause.
HITLER
Did they mark you like they did the other survivors?
PVT. BUTZ
Yes, mein Führer.
HITLER
Remove your hat and show me.
LT. ALDO
Now say we let ya go, and say you survive the
war? When you get back
home, what ’cha gonna do?
PVT. BUTZ
I will hug my mother like I’ve never hugged her before.
LT. ALDO
Well, ain’t that a real nice boy. Are you going to take off your uniform?
PVT. BUTZ
Not only shall I remove it, but I intend to burn it!
The young German is telling Aldo what he thinks Aldo wants to hear. But the last answer didn’t go down as well as he thought it would, as is evident by the frown on Aldo’s face.
LT. ALDO
Yeah, that’s what we thought. We don’t like that. You see, we like our Nazis
in uniforms. That way, you can spot ’em just like that.
(snaps his fingers)
But you take off that uniform, ain’t nobody gonna know you was a Nazi.
And that don’t sit well with us.
Aldo removes a LARGE KNIFE from a sheath on his belt.
LT. ALDO
So I’m gonna give ya a little somethin’ you can’t take off.
BACK TO HITLER
Pvt. Butz removes his combat helmet. Hair hangs in his face. He moves it aside, and WE SEE a SWASTIKA has been HAND-CARVED INTO HIS FOREHEAD.
BACK TO BASTERDS
BUTZ’S POV
on ground, looking up at them. Aldo has just carved the swastika, and he’s holding the bloody knife. All the Basterds crowd around to admire his handiwork.
SGT. DONOWITZ
You know, Lieutenant, you’re getting pretty good at that.
LT. ALDO
You know how you get to Carnegie Hall, don’t cha? Practice.
FADE TO BLACK
OVER BLACK
CHAPTER TITLE APPEARS:
CHAPTER THREE
“GERMAN NIGHT IN PARIS”
INT—CINEMA AUDITORIUM—NIGHT
We’re in the auditorium of a cinema in Paris. However, the
CAMERA is pointed in the direction of the audience, not the screen. We start CLOSE on the projector beam emanating from the little glass window in the back of the theater.
The CAMERA continues to DOLLY back, making the shot wider and wider, bringing in more and more the German-occupied citizens of Paris, who stare at the OFFSCREEN silver screen in the dark.
We can hear the OFFSCREEN SOUNDTRACK of a Goebbels-produced German omm-pa-pa musical movie being projected.
The shot continues to pull farther and farther back, and the German dialogue continues to fill the auditorium . . .
UNTIL . . .
The DOLY SHOT LANDS on a CLOSEUP of Shosanna, watching the movie.
A SUBTITLE APPEARS:
“SHOSANNA DREYFUS
TWO WEEKS AFTER THE MASSACRE
OF SHOSANNA’S FAMILY”
We hear the sound of the German musical’s climax.
The lights go up in the auditorium.
Shosanna, dressed in a NURSE’S UNIFORM she swiped from
somewhere, remains seated, as the rest of the PATRONS gather their coats and file out.
EXT—LITTLE CINEMA (PARIS)—NIGHT
Patrons exit under the cinema marquee, as someone from inside SHUTS OFF the marquee’s lights.
The MARQUEE READS in French:
“GERMAN NIGHT BRIDGET VON HAMMERSMARK in MADCAP IN MEXICO.”
EXT—PROJECTION BOOTH (LITTLE CINEMA)
A French black man, who we will learn later is named MARCEL,
is the cinema’s projectionist. We see him for a moment, taking the film reels off the projector and placing them on rewinds.
INT—AUDITORIUM
CU SHOSANNA
Still sitting in her seat. Except for her, the auditorium is empty.
The owner of the cinema, an attractive-looking French woman, who we will later know as MADAME MIMIEUX, appears in one of the cinema’s opera-box balconies.
Looking down from her porch at the young girl, sitting in the empty cinema.
The DIALOGUE will be spoken in FRENCH and SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH.
MADAME MIMIEUX
So, young woman, since it’s beyond obvious we’re closed for the evening, I must assume you want something. What can I do for you?
SHOSANNA
May I sleep here tonight?
MADAME MIMIEUX
So I gather you’re not a nurse?
SHOSANNA
No.
MADAME MIMIEUX
But you’re a bright little thing. That’s a clever disguise. Where is your family?
SHOSANNA
Murdered.
MADAME MIMIEUX
So you’re a war orphan?
SHOSANNA
We were from Nancy. The Boches found us—
MADAME MIMIEUX
—Is this a sad story?
SHOSANNA.
Oui.
MADAME MIMIEUX
Sad stories bore me. These days everyone in Paris has one. I haven’t bored you with mine. Don’t bore me with yours.
SHOSANNA
You can run the machines?
MADAME MIMIEUX
What machines?
Using her hands to pantomime the rotating film reels on a projector, she says:
SHOSANNA
The machines that show the film.
MADAME MIMIEUX
The projectors? Yes, I own a cinema.
Of course I can operate them.
SHOSANNA
I know, I saw you.
FLASH ON:
CU SHOSANNA
eyes creeping up the stairway in the projection booth, watching . . .
MADAME MIMIEUX
expertly working the projectors . . .
BACK TO SHOSANNA
SHOSANNA
Teach me. Teach me to run the machines that show the film. It’s only you and
the negro. I know you could use some help.
MADAME MIMIEUX
I know at least six people who’ve been put up against a wall and machine-
gunned for sheltering enemies of the state. I
have no intention of being unlucky number
seven. How long have
you been in Paris?
SHOSANNA
A week and a few days.
MADAME MIMIEUX
How have you survived the curfew
without capture?
SHOSANNA
I sleep on rooftops.
MADAME MIMIEUX
Again, I’m forced to admit, clever
girl. How is it?
SHOSANNA
Cold.
MADAME MIMIEUX
(laughs)
I can imagine.
SHOSANNA
Respectfully, no you can’t.
Pause.
MADAME MIMIEUX
Fair enough.
Thinks . . .
MADAME MIMIEUX
So you can’t operate a 35mm film projector. You want me to teach you, in order to work here, in order to use my cinema as a hole to hide in. Is that correct?
SHOSANNA
Oui.
MADAME MIMIEUX
What’s your name?
SHOSANNA
Shosanna.
MADAME MIMIEUX
I’m Madame Mimieux. You may call
me Madame. This is a cinema. Not a
home for wayward war orphans.
Having said that, what you say is true.
If you were truly exceptional, I could
find use for you. So, Shosanna, are you
truly exceptional?
SHOSANNA
Oui, Madame.
MADAME MIMIEUX
I will be the judge of that.
DISSOLVE TO
TITLE CARD:
Which shows a lovely PENCIL SKETCH of the CITY OF PARIS, complete with Eiffel Tower.
ABOVE IT READS:
“1944
PARIS”
THEN...
The CAMERA PULLS BACK, and we see we’re not looking at a TITLE CARD at all, but a CALENDER stuck on the wall of the little cinema’s projection booth. Before we leave it, WE SEE the
month is JUNE . . .
The CAMERA finds the THREE-YEARS-OLDER SHOSANNA working
as the PROJECTIONIST. It would appear that Shosanna passed Madame Mimieux’s exceptional test.
A	lyrical, Morricone-like tune PLAYS on the SOUNDTRACK. This will be “Shosanna’s Theme.”
A little bell begins RINGING on one of the projectors, alerting Shosanna its time for a REEL CHANGE.
Shosanna stands at the projector, watching the old German film she’s projecting, waiting for the FIRST REEL CHANGE MARK . . .
SILVER	SCREEN
of the	little	cinema. Onscreen	LENI RIEFENSTAHL lies
horizontal as	an icicle drips on her head in the old
German	film “The White Hell of	Pitz Palu.”
The FIRST REEL	CHANGE MARK POPS ON in the upper-right-
hand corner of	the FRAME (that	tells the projectionist
to get	ready).
As the FILM REEL on the FIRST PROJECTOR rolls out, Shosanna stands ready, waiting by the SECOND PROJECTOR . . .
WHEN...
SILVER SCREEN
the SECOND REEL CHANGE MARK POPS ON in the same place (that’s the one).
SHOSANNA
THROWS the lever on the SECOND PROJECTOR, switching the film from projector 1 to projector 2, executing a perfect REEL CHANGE.
As “Shosanna’s Theme” plays on the soundtrack, we watch, via MONTAGE, her go through her daily chores: carry heavy film cans up the stairs, empty the rat traps, etc, etc. . . .
EXT—CINEMA—NIGHT
The MARQUEE READS in French:
“GERMAN NIGHT LENI RIEFENSTAHL in PABST’S WHITE HELL OF PITZ PALU”
Shosanna emerges from the cinema carrying two buckets of LETTERS (for the marquee) and a tall ladder. Her chore here, obviously, is to change the show on the marquee.
The LITERARY NARRATOR comes on the soundtrack in ENGLISH:
NARRATOR (VO)
To operate a cinema in Paris during
the occupation, one had two choices. Either you could show new German propaganda films, produced under the watchful
eye of Joseph Goebbels. Or . . . you
could have a German night in your
weekly schedule and show allowed
German classic films.
Their German night was Thursday.
Shosanna, by herself, perched up high on the ladder, changing the letters on the marquee.
A YOUNG GERMAN SOLDIER (about the same age as Shosanna) walks out of the cinema. He sees the ladder with the young French girl on top and walks over.
They speak FRENCH, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:
GERMAN SOLDIER
What starts tomorrow?
Shosanna looks down, seeing the young German soldier smiling up at her from below.
SHOSANNA
A Max Linder festival.
GERMAN SOLDIER
Ummm, I always preferred Linder to Chaplin.
Except Linder never made a
film as good as “The Kid.” The chase climax of “The Kid,” superb.
Shosanna continues working, not adding to the conversation.
GERMAN SOLDIER
I suppose now you could use an M,
an A, and an X?
SHOSANNA
No need, I can manage.
GERMAN SOLDIER
Don’t be ridiculous. It’s my pleasure.
He hands the French damsel the letters spelling MAX.
SHOSANNA
Merci.
GERMAN SOLDIER
I adore your cinema very much.
SHOSANNA
Merci.
She busies herself with the marquee letters . . .
GERMAN SOLDIER
Is it yours?
SHOSANNA
Do I own it?
GERMAN SOLDIER
Oui.
SHOSANNA
Oui.
GERMAN SOLDIER
How does a young girl such as yourself own a cinema?
Due to his uniform and Shosanna’s situation, his efforts at trying to make small talk strike the young Jewess in hiding as a Gestapo interrogation.
SHOSANNA
My aunt left it to me.
GERMAN SOLDIER
Lucky girl.
Shosanna makes no reply back.
GERMAN SOLDIER
Merci for hosting a German night.
SHOSANNA
I don’t have a choice, but you’re welcome.
GERMAN SOLDIER
Do you choose the German films yourself?
SHOSANNA
Oui.
GERMAN SOLDIER
Then my merci stands. I love the Riefenstahl mountain films, especially “Pitz Palu.” It’s nice to see a French girl who’s an admirer of Riefenstahl.
SHOSANNA
“Admire” would not be the adjective
I would use to describe my feelings toward Fräulein Riefenstahl.
GERMAN SOLDIER
But you do admire the director Pabst, don’t you? That’s why you included his name on the marquee.
She climbs down from the ladder and faces the German private.
SHOSANNA
I’m French. We respect directors
in our country.
GERMAN SOLDIER
Apparently even Germans.
SHOSANNA
Even Germans. Merci for your assistance,
Private. Adieu.
She turns to go back inside.
GERMAN SOLDIER
You’re not finished?
SHOSANNA
I’ll finish in the morning.
She opens the door to go inside.
GERMAN SOLDIER
May I ask your name?
SHOSANNA
You wish to see my papers?
She hands him her excellently forged papers.
That’s obviously not what he meant, but he takes them anyway to read her name.
COL. LANDA
Emmanuelle Mimieux. That’s a very
pretty name.
SHOSANNA
Merci. Are you finished with my papers?
He hands them back.
GERMAN SOLDIER
Mademoiselle. My name is Frederick Zoller.
She gives no response.
GERMAN SOLDIER
It’s been a pleasure chatting with a fellow cinema lover. Sweet dreams, Mademoiselle.
He gives her a little salute and walks into the black of a curfew-imposed night.
She looks after him. She didn’t show it, but he kind of got to her. After all, for any true cinema lover, it’s hard to hate anybody who, CINEMA MON AMOUR.
EXT—ROOFTOP CINEMA—NIGHT
Shosanna stands on the roof her her cinema, late at night, lighting up a cigarette. As she takes her first big drag,
she remembers a voice.
FLASH ON
MADAME MIMIEUX, the younger Shosanna, and the black projectionist, Marcel, in the projection booth. Shosanna
lights up a cigarette, and Madame Mimieux SLAPS her face HARD, knocking the cigarette out of her mouth. Marcel quickly STAMPS it out on the floor.
MADAME	MIMIEUX
If I ever see	you light	up a cigarette in my
cinema again,	I’ll turn	you in to the Nazis, do
you understand?
Shosanna is shocked by this statement.
SHOSANNA
Oui, Madame.
MADAME MIMIEUX
And for bringing an open flame into my cinema, you deserve far worse than a Nazi Jewish boxcar. With your thick head, what do you think the highest priority of a cinema manager is? Keeping this fucking place from burning down to the ground, that’s what!
In my collection, I have over three hundred and fifty 35mm, nitrate film prints, which are not only immensely flammable but highy unstable. And should they catch fire, they burn three times faster than paper. If that happens . . .
POOF . . . all gone, cinema no more, everybody burned alive. If I ever
see you with an open flame in my cinema again, I won’t turn you into the Nazis. I’ll kill you myself. And the fucking Germans will give me a curfew pass.
Do you understand me?
SHOSANNA
Oui, Madame.
MADAME MIMIEUX
Do you believe me?
SHOSANNA
Oui, Madame.
MADAME MIMIEUX
You damn well better.
BACK TO ROOF
Shosanna exhales cigarette smoke.
Marcel comes onto the roof.
MARCEL
Are you well?
SHOSANNA
Even on the roof I can’t smoke a cigarette without hearing Madame’s
voice yelling at me. That’s why I
do it. To hear Madame’s voice again.
MARCEL
We both miss her.
SHOSANNA
I know. I’m fine, darling. I’ll be
to bed soon.
Marcel goes back inside. Shosanna smokes.
INT—FRENCH BISTRO—AFTERNOON
Shosanna sits in the back of a French bistro, reading a book, “The Saint in New York,” by Leslie Charteris, drinking wine when the young German soldier from the other day,
FREDRICK ZOLLER, walks in. He gets a beer, then notices the French girl sitting in the back. He smiles and heads over to her. “Oh no, not this guy again,” she thinks.
Again they speak in FRENCH SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:
FREDRICK
May I join you?
SHOSANNA
Look, Fredrick—
FREDRICK
(smiling)
—You remember my name?
SHOSANNA
Yes . . . Look, you seem a pleasant
enough fellow—
FREDRICK
—Merci.
SHOSANNA
You’re welcome. Regardless, I want you to stop pestering me.
FREDRICK
I apologize, Mademoiselle. I wasn’t trying to be a pest. I was simply trying to be friendly.
SHOSANNA
I don’t wish to be your friend.
FREDRICK
Why not?
SHOSANNA
Don’t act like an infant. You know why.
FREDRICK
I’m more than just a uniform.
SHOSANNA
Not to me. If you are so desperate for
a French girlfriend, I suggest you try Vichy.
Just then TWO OTHER GERMAN SOLDIERS come over, obviously very impressed with Fredrick. They make a fuss over him in UNSUBTITLED GERMAN, which neither Shosanna or the non-German-speaking members of the movie’s audience can understand.
He signs autographs for them and shakes their hands, and they go on their way.
Shosanna’s eyes narrow.
SHOSANNA
Who are you?
FREDRICK
I thought I was just a uniform.
SHOSANNA
You’re not just a German soldier. Are you somebody’s son?
FREDRICK
Most German soldiers are somebody’s son.
SHOSANNA
Yeah, but you’re not just somebody. What are you, Hitler’s nephew?
He leans in across the table. She leans in too, and he says:
FREDRICK
Yes.
SHOSANNA
Really?
FREDRICK
No, not really. I’m just teasing you.
She leans back, annoyed.
SHOSANNA
Then what is it? What are you, a German movie star?
FREDRICK
Not exactly.
SHOSANNA
(Pfuit) What does that mean, “not exactly”? I asked if you were a movie star. The answer to that question is yes or no.
Fredrick laughs at that line.
FREDRICK
When you said that just now, you reminded me of my sister.
This catches young Shosanna off guard.
FREDRICK
I come from a home of six sisters.
We run a family-operated cinema in Munich. Seeing you run around your cinema reminds me of them. Especially my sister Helga. She raised me, when our father wasn’t up to the job. I admire her very much. You’d like her. She doesn’t wear a German uniform.
SHOSANNA
You were raised by Helga?
FREDRICK
All my sisters. I’m the baby, but Helga was the bossiest.
SHOSANNA
And your mother and father?
FREDRICK
My mother	died. And my father	was a
loser. My	father’s	motto: “If	at first
you don’t	succeed,	quit.” The	day he
left,	good riddance.	My sisters	are
all I	need. It’s	why	I like your cinema.
It makes me feel	both	closer	to	them
and a	little homesick	at the	same time.
SHOSANNA
Is your cinema still operating?
FREDRICK
Oui.
SHOSANNA
What’s it called?
FREDRICK
The Kino Haus.
SHOSANNA
How has it done during the war?
FREDRICK
Actually, in Germany, cinema
attendance is up.
SHOSANNA
No doubt. You don’t have to operate under a curfew.
FREDRICK
How often do you fill your house?
SHOSANNA
(Pfuit) Not since before the war.
FREDRICK
So if you had one big engagement, that would help you out?
SHOSANNA
Of course, but that’s not likely to happen.
TWO MORE	GERMAN	SOLDIERS and their	TWO	FRENCH	DATES	approach
the table. They	ask for	Fredrick’s	autograph,	and he signs it for
them. One of the French	girls	says, in	FRENCH, how exciting
it is to	meet a	real live	German war hero. Shosanna	hears
it. They	leave.	So that’s	it,	she thinks.
SHOSANNA
So you’re a war hero? Why didn’t you tell me?
FREDRICK
Everybody knows that. I liked that you didn’t.
SHOSANNA
What did you do?
He takes a sip of beer.
FREDRICK
I’ve shot the most enemy soldiers
in World War Two . . . so far.
You bet your sweet ass that got her attention.
SHOSANNA
Wow.
FREDRICK
I was alone in a bell tower in a
walled-off city in Russia. It was
myself and a thousand rounds of ammo
in a bird’s nest, against three
hundred Soviet soldiers.
SHOSANNA
What’s a bird’s nest?
FREDRICK
A bird’s nest is what a sniper would call a bell tower. It’s a high structure, offering a three-hundred-and-sixty-degree view. Very advantageous for marksmen.
SHOSANNA
How many Russians did you kill?
FREDRICK
Sixty-eight.
(beat)
The first day. A hundred and fifty the second day. Thirty-two the third day.
On the fourth day, they exited the city. Naturally my war story received a lot of attention in Germany. That’s why they all recognize me. They call me the German Sergeant York.
SHOSANNA
Maybe they’ll make a film about
your exploits.
FREDRICK
Well, that’s just what Joseph Goebbels thought. So he did. It’s called “Nation’s Pride,” and guess what, they wanted me to play myself, so I did. They have posters for it in kiosks all over Paris. That’s another reason for all the attention.
SHOSANNA
“Nation’s Pride” is about you? “Nation’s Pride” is starring you?
FREDRICK
I know, comical, huh?
SHOSANNA
Not so comical. So what are you doing
in Paris, enjoying a rest?
FREDRICK
Hardly. I’ve been doing publicity, having my pictures taken with different German luminaries, visiting troops,
that sort of thing. Goebbels wants the film to premiere in Paris, so I’ve been helping them in the planning.
Joseph is very keen on this film.
He’s telling anybody who will listen that when “Nation’s Pride” is released I’ll be the German Van Johnson.
Shosanna isn’t falling for the young German by any stretch.
However, his exploits, as well as his charming manner, can’t
help but impress. But his referring to Goebbels as “Joseph,”
like they’re friends, is all she needs to get on the right side of
things. This young man is trouble with a capital T, and
she needs to stay far fucking away from him.
She abruptly rises and says:
SHOSANNA
Well, good luck with your premiere, Private. I hope all goes well for
Joseph and yourself. Au revoir.
And with that, she disappears, leaving the perplexed private alone.
EXT—CINEMA MARQUEE—DAY
It’s the next day.
Shosanna and Marcel are changing the letters on the marquee.
Marcel excuses himself to visit the toilet.
Shosanna is alone outside the little cinema, perched up on her ladder.
WHEN...
. . . A BLACK NAZI SEDAN pulls up in front of the little cinema.
A GERMAN MAJOR in a black Gestapo uniform steps out of the back of the sedan.
The DRIVER, a German private, steps out as well.
Yelling to the young girl up high on the ladder:
Both GERMAN and FRENCH will be SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH.
GESTAPO MAJOR
Mademoiselle Mimieux?
SHOSANNA
Oui?
Telling his driver in German to ask her in French:
GESTAPO MAJOR
Ask her if this is her cinema.
In French the driver asks Shosanna:
DRIVER
Is this your cinema?
SHOSANNA
Oui.
GESTAPO MAJOR
Tell her to come down.
DRIVER
Come down, please.
She climbs down the ladder.
The driver opens the back door of the sedan, indicating for her to get in.
SHOSANNA
I don’t understand. What have I done?
DRIVER
(to major)
She wants to know what she’s done?
GESTAPO MAJOR
Who says she’s done anything?
DRIVER
Who says you’ve done anything?
Then in her best imitation of Mademoiselle Mimeux’s arrogant manner.
SHOSANNA
Then I demand to know what this is about, and where do you propose to take me?
The driver begins to translate when the Gestapo major holds up his hand, telling him not to bother. The major looks at the young French girl and tells her in German:
GESTAPO MAJOR
Get your ass in that car.
No translation necessary. She climbs into the back of the car, followed by the Germans. The sedan takes off.
INT—SEDAN (MOVING)—DAY
The Nazi sedan drives through the early-afternoon Paris streets.
WE HOLD SHOSANNA IN TIGHT CU
the whole ride, never showing her Nazi oppressor sitting beside her. We just hold on her face trying not to reveal anything.
The sedan stops.
The car door opens, and the driver offers Shosanna his hand.
EXT/INT—MAXIM’S (FAMOUS PARIS CAFÉ)—DAY
She steps out of the car and is led into a Paris café by the Gestapo officer. It takes the young Jewess a moment or two before she realizes she’s not being led to a Gestapo interrogation room, a railroad car, or a concentration camp, but to lunch.
The best table at Maxim’s. Three people, and two dogs, sit at it: Germany’s minister of propaganda and the number-two man in Hitler’s Third Reich, JOSEPH GOEBBELS; his female French translator (and mistress), FRANCESCA MONDINO; and young Private Zoller.
TWO BLACK FRENCH POODLES belonging to Mademoiselle Mondino sit together in another chair at the table.
We join the in mid-conversation:
They all speak GERMAN, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH;
GOEBBELS
—it’s only the offspring of slaves that
allows America to be competitive athletically.
American Olympic gold can be measured
in Negro sweat.
Shosanna is led through the French eatery by the Gestapo major. Private Zoller sees her and stands up, excuses himself,
and greets her before she reaches the table.
Fredrick says in French, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH;
FREDRICK
Good you came. I wasn’t sure whether or not you’d accept my invitation.
SHOSANNA
Invitation?
THEN...
. . . Goebbels’s voice says OFFSCREEN:
GOEBBELS (OS)
Is that the young lady in question, Fredrick?
Private Zoller turns in his direction, takes Shosanna by the arm, and leads her to him.
FREDRICK
Yes, it is, Herr Goebbels. Emmanuelle, there is somebody I want you to meet.
Joseph Goebbels, remaining seated, looks up at the young French girl, scrutinizing her as he spoons crème brûlée into his mouth.
The excited Fredrick introduces Shosanna to the propaganda minister formally.
FREDRICK
Emmanuelle Mimieux, I’d like to introduce you to the minister of propaganda, the leader of the entire German film industry, and now I’m an actor, my boss, Joseph Goebbels.
Goebbels offers up his long, spiderlike fingers for Shosanna to shake. She does.
GOEBBELS
Your reputation precedes you, Fräulein Mimieux.
He looks to Francesca to translate, but she’s just taken a big bite of tiramisu.
They all laugh.
Frederick jumps in . . .
FREDRICK
And normally, this is Herr Goebbels’s French interpreter, Mademoiselle Francesca Mondino.
FRANCESCA
looks up at Shosanna.
NARRATOR’S VOICE comes on soundtrack:
NARRATOR (VO)
Francesca Mondino is much more than Goebbels’s French interpreter.
She’s also Goebbels’s favorite French actress to appear in his films . . . . .
FLASH ON
FRENCH CLIP
from one of Francesca’s B/W Goebbels produced productions.
Francesca, dressed as a French peasant girl, with a YOUNG GERMAN (MOVIE) SOLDIER.
She speaks in FRENCH, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:
FRANCESCA/PEASANT GIRL
I love you, I can’t help it. My country or my heart, which do I betray?
A SUBTITLE APPEARS below naming the film’s title:
“SENTIMENTAL COMBAT” (1943)
FLASH ON
Francesca and Goebbels having sex in her boudoir, on her red velvet bed.
NARRATOR (VO)
And Goebbels’s favorite French mistress, to act in his bed.
WE SEE JUST A SUPER-QUICK SHOT OF Goebbels FUCKING Francesca DOGGY-STYLE.
FRANCESCA
(animal-like)
Do it! Do it! Fuck me—fill me!
BACK TO FRANCESCA
looking at Shosanna.
FRANCESCA
Bonjour.
SHOSANNA
Bonjour.
FREDRICK
And you’ve met the major.
The Gestapo officer steps up and says to Fredrick in German:
GESTAPO MAJOR
Actually, I didn’t introduce myself.
(to Shosanna)
Major Dieter Hellstrom of the Gestapo, at your service, Mademoiselle.
(he clicks
his heels)
Please allow me. Have a seat.
The Gestapo officer pulls out a chair for the young lady to sit down. Shosanna takes the hot seat. Seated to her right is Pvt. Zoller. To her left are the two curly, pampered poodles. Major Hellstrom pours Shosanna a glass of red wine from a small carafe on the table.
