MAJOR HELLSTROM
Try the wine, Mademoiselle. It’s quite good.
Goebbels looks across the table at her.
GOEBBELS
Well, I must say, you’ve made quite an
impression on our boy.
Francesca interprets Goebbels’s German for Shosanna.
GOEBBELS
I must say, Fräulein, I should be rather annoyed with you.
Francesca interprets . . .
GOEBBELS
I arrive in France, and I wish to have lunch with my star . . .
Francesca interprets . . .
GOEBBELS
Little do I know he’s become
the toast of Paris, and now he
must find time for me.
Francesca interprets . . .
GOEBBELS
People wait in line hours, days,
to see me. For the Führer and
Private Zoller, I wait.
Francesca interprets . . .
GOEBBELS
So finally, I’m granted an audience
with the young private, and he spends the entire lunch speaking of you
and your cinema.
Francesca interprets . . .
GOEBBELS
So Fräulein Mimieux, let’s get down
to business.
Private Zoller interrupts—
FREDRICK
Herr Goebbels, I haven’t informed
her yet.
GOEBBELS
Unless the girl’s a simpleton, I’m
sure she’s figured it out by now.
After all, she does operate a cinema.
Francesca, tell her.
Francesca tells Shosanna in French:
FRANCESCA
What they’re trying to tell you, Emmanuelle, is Private Zoller has
spent the last hour at lunch,
trying to convince Monsieur Goebbels
to abandon previous plans for Private Zoller’s film premiere and change the venue to your cinema.
Zoller reacts.
FRANCESCA
(FRENCH to Zoller)
What?
FREDRICK
I wanted to inform her.
FRANCESCA
Shit. I apologize, Private. Of course you did.
GOEBBELS
(GERMAN to Francesca)
What’s the issue?
FRANCESCA
The young soldier wanted to inform the
mademoiselle himself.
GOEBBELS
Nonsense. Until I ask a few
questions, he has nothing to inform.
Let the record state, I have not
agreed to a venue change.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
Duly noted.
Goebbels speaks German to Shosanna:
GOEBBELS
You have opera boxes?
SHOSANNA
Oui.
GOEBBELS
How many?
SHOSANNA
Three.
GOEBBELS
More would be better. How many
seats in your auditorium?
SHOSANNA
Three hundred and fifty.
GOEBBELS
That’s almost four hundred less
than The Ritz.
Fredrick jumps in . . .
FREDRICK
But Herr Goebbels, that’s not such
a terrible thing. You said yourself
you didn’t want to indulge every
two-faced French bourgeois taking
up space currying favor. With less
seats it makes the event more
exclusive. You’re not trying to fill
the house, they’re fighting for seats.
FREDRICK
(CON’T)
Besides, to hell with the French.
This is a German night, a German
event, a German celebration. This
night is for you, me, the German military, the High Command, their
family and friends. The only people
who should be allowed in the room
are people who will be moved by
the exploits onscreen.
Goebbels listens silently, then after a bit of a pause:
GOEBBELS
I see your public speaking has
improved. It appears I’ve created
a monster. A strangely persuasive monster. When the war’s over,
politics awaits.
Table chuckles.
GOEBBELS
Well, Private, though it is true
I’m inclined to indulge you anything,
I must watch a film in this young
lady’s cinema before I can say
yes or no.
(to Shosanna)
So, young lady, you are to close
your cinema tonight and have
a private screening for me.
Francesca interprets . . .
GOEBBELS
What German films do you have?
Francesca asks . . .
SHOSANNA
My cinema, on German night, tends
to show older German classics.
Francesca interprets . . .
GOEBBELS
Why not my films?
Francesca asks . . . ?
SHOSANNA
I draw an older German audience in
my cinema that appreciates the
nostalgia of an earlier time.
Francesca interprets . . .
GOEBBELS
That’s nonsense, Fräulein. We Germans
are looking forward, not backward.
That era of German cinema is dead.
The German cinema I create will not
only be the cinema of Europe, but
the world’s only alternative to the degenerate Jewish influence of
Hollywood.
Fredrick jumps in . . .
FREDRICK
Along with being a cinema owner, Emmanuelle is
quite a formidable
film critic.
He chuckles, but alone.
GOEBBELS
So it would appear. Unfortunately
for the Fräulein, I’ve outlawed
film criticism.
Zoller, thinking fast, says:
FREDRICK
Why don’t you screen “Lucky Kids”?
I’m sure Emmanuelle hasn’t seen it.
And it’s so funny. I’ve been meaning
to recommend it to her, for her
German night. That’s a great idea.
Let’s watch “Lucky Kids” tonight.
GOEBBELS
Ahhh, “Lucky Kids,” “Lucky Kids,”
“Lucky Kids.” When all is said and
done, my most purely enjoyable production. Not only that, I
wouldn’t be surprised if sixty
years from now, it’s “Lucky Kids”
that I’m the most remembered for.
I know it doesn’t seem like it now,
but mark my words.
Very well, I’ll have a print sent
over to the Fräulein’s cinema.
We’ll screen “Lucky Kids” tonight.
As Francesca interprets this for Shosanna . . .
the empty chair next to the young Jewish girl is suddenly filled with the bottom half of a gray S.S. officer uniform.
GOEBBELS
Ah, Landa, you’re here. This is the young lady in question.
The S.S. officer sits down, and it’s our old friend from the first scene, COL. HANS LANDA.
FREDRICK
Emmanuelle, this is Col. Hans Landa of
the S.S. He’ll be running security
for the premiere.
CU SHOSANNA
A bomb is dropped and detonated behind her eyes. But if she gives any indication of this, her war story ends here.
The S.S. OFFICER
who murered her family takes her hand and kisses it, saying in perfect French:
COL. LANDA
Charmed, Mademoiselle.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
Better known as “the Jew Hunter.”
The table laughs.
GOEBBELS
Oh, Francesca, what was that funny
thing the Führer said about Hans?
FRANCESCA
What thing?
GOEBBELS
You know, you were there. It was a
funny thing the Führer said,
about Hans . . . something about a pig?
Francesca’s memory is jogged.
FRANCESCA
Oh, yes, of course.
She repeats it by whispering it in Goebbels’s ear.
GOEBBELS
Oh, yes, of course, that’s it. So
the Führer said he wouldn’t be
surprised if Hans weren’t rooting
out Jews like a truffle pig from
the playpen.
FRANCESCA
That’s what we need, pigs that can
root out Jews.
COL. LANDA
Who needs pigs when you have me?
Big, hearty laugh around the table.
GOEBBELS
Do you have an engagement tonight?
COL. LANDA
Well, as a matter of fact, I do—
GOEBBELS
—Break it. We’re all going to the fräulein’s
cinema tonight to view
“Lucky Kids.”
COL. LANDA
Splendid.
Then the Reich minister’s companion, Mademoiselle Mondino, interrupts:
FRANCESCA
And now I must get Reich Minister Goebbels to his next appointment.
GOEBBELS
Slave driver! French slave driver!
They all chuckle.
Everybody begins to stand up from the table . . .
Francesca gathers the stupid dogs . . .
As Col. Landa stands, he says:
COL. LANDA
Actually, in my role as security
chief of this joyous German occasion, I’m afraid I must have a word with Mademoiselle Mimieux.
Mademoiselle Mimieux’s eyes go to Private Zoller, who responds.
FREDRICK
What sort of discussion?
COL. LANDA
That sounded suspiciously like
a soldier questioning the order of a colonel?
Or am I just being sensitive?
FREDRICK
Nothing could be further from the
truth, Colonel. Your authority is
beyond question.
But your reputation precedes
you. Should Mademoiselle Mimieux
or myself be concerned?
GOEBBELS
Hans, the boy means no harm, he’s
simply smitten. And he’s correct.
Your reputation does precede you.
Laughter all around. The Reich minister and his Axis entourage make their way to front of the café, with the two dumb dogs on
a leash, leading the way.
COL. LANDA
No need for concern, you two.
As security chief, I simply need
to have a chat with the possible
new venue’s property owner.
FREDRICK
I was just hoping to escort
Mademoiselle Mimieux back to her
cinema.
GOEBBELS
Nonsense! You can eat ice cream
and walk along the Seine another
time. Right now, allow Col. Landa
to do his job.
Everybody says their farewells.
Col. Landa offers the young Jew in hiding a seat at a small table in the outside patio area of Maxim’s.
The fluency and poetic proficiency of the S.S. Jew hunter’s French reveals to the audience that his feigning clumsiness at French with Monsieur LaPadite in the film’s first scene was simply an interrogation technique.
They speak FRENCH SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:
COL. LANDA
Have you tried the strudel here?
SHOSANNA
No.
COL. LANDA
It’s not so terrible. So how is it
the young private and yourself came
to be acquainted?
She’s about to answer when a WAITER approaches.
COL. LANDA
Yes, two strudels, one for myself
and one for the mademoiselle. A cup
of espresso, with a container of
steamed milk on the side.
For the Mademoiselle, a glass of milk.
Considering that Shosanna grew up on a dairy farm, and the last time she was on a dairy farm her strudel companion murdered her entire family, his ordering her milk is, to say the least . . . disconcerting.
The key to Col. Landa’s power and/or charm, depending on the side one’s on, lies in his ability to convince you he’s privy to your secrets.
The waiter exits.
COL. LANDA
So, Mademoiselle, you were beginning
to explain . . . ?
SHOSANNA
(anxiously)
Up until a couple of days ago,
I had no knowledge of Private Zoller
or his exploits. To me, the private
was simply just a patron of my cinema. We spoke a few times, but—
COL. LANDA
—Mademoiselle, let me interrupt you. This is a simple formality, no
reason for you to feel anxious.
The strudel arrives.
The colonel takes one look at it and says to the waiter:
COL. LANDA
I apologize. I forgot to order the
crème fraîche.
WAITER
One moment.
He exits.
COL. LANDA
(referring to
the crème.)
Wait for the crème
(back to
business)
So, Emmanuelle—May I call you Emmanuelle?
SHOSANNA
Oui.
COL. LANDA
So, Emmanuelle, explain to me how
does it happen that a young lady
such as yourself comes to own a
cinema?
The waiter returns, applying crème fraîche to the two strudels.
The S.S. colonel looks across the table at his companion. Picking up his fork, he says:
COL. LANDA
After you.
Shosanna takes a whipped-creamy bite of strudel. Landa follows her lead.
COL. LANDA
(mouthful
of strudel)
Success?
Shosanna, mouth full of strudel, indicates she approves.
COL. LANDA
Like I said, not so terrible.
(back to
business)
So you were explaining the origin of your cinema ownership?
SHOSANNA
The cinema originally belonged to
my aunt and uncle—
Col. Landa removes a little black book from his pocket.
COL. LANDA
—What are their names?
SHOSANNA
Jean-Pierre and Ada Mimieux.
He records the names in his little book.
COL. LANDA
Where are they now?
SHOSANNA
My uncle was killed during the blitzkrieg.
COL. LANDA
Pity . . . Continue.
SHOSANNA
Aunt Ada passed away from fever
last spring.
COL. LANDA
Regrettable.
(respectful
pause)
It’s come to my attention you have
a negro in your employ. Is that true?
SHOSANNA
Yes, he’s a Frenchman. His name is Marcel. He worked with my aunt and
uncle since they opened the cinema.
He’s the only other one who works
with me.
COL. LANDA
Doing what?
SHOSANNA
Projectionist.
COL. LANDA
Is he any good?
SHOSANNA
The best.
COL. LANDA
Actually, one could see where that
might be a good trade for them.
Can you operate the projectors?
SHOSANNA
Of course I can.
COL. LANDA
Knowing the Reich Minister as I do,
I’m quite positive he wouldn’t want
the success or failure of his illustrious evening dependent on
the prowess of a negro. So if it
comes to pass that we hold this event
at your venue—talented, no doubt,
as your negro may be—you will
operate the projectors. Is that acceptable?
As if she has any say.
SHOSANNA
Oui.
Col. Landa takes another bite of strudel, and Shosanna follows suit.
COL. LANDA
So it would appear our young hero is quite smitten with you?
SHOSANNA
Private Zoller’s feelings for me
aren’t of a romantic nature.
COL. LANDA
Mademoiselle . . . ?
SHOSANNA
Colonel, his feelings are not
romantic. I remind him of his sister.
COL. LANDA
That doesn’t mean his feelings
aren’t romantic.
SHOSANNA
I remind him of his sister who
raised him.
COL. LANDA
It’s sounding more and more romantic
by the minute.
Landa takes out a handsome-looking cigarette case, with an S.S. LOGO on it. Removing one of the fags, he lights it up with a fancy S.S. gold lighter. He offers one to Shosanna.
COL. LANDA
Cigarette?
SHOSANNA
No, thank you.
COL. LANDA
Do you smoke?
SHOSANNA
Yes.
COL. LANDA
Then I insist, you must take one. They’re not French, they’re German.
I hope you’re not nationalist about
your tobacco. To me, French cigarettes are a sin against nicotine.
She takes one but makes no move to light it.
He inhales deeply and says:
COL. LANDA
I did have something else I wanted
to ask you, but right now, for the
life of me, I can’t remember what it is. Oh, well, must not have been important.
Col. Landa stands up, throws some French francs on the table, puts on his gray S.S. cap, touches his finger to his visor, saluting Shosanna, and says:
COL. LANDA
Till tonight.
And with that he’s gone.
Shosanna breaths a sigh of relief.
The CAMERA begins to slowly lower from a MEDIUM CU to her feet and ankles and the floor. We see her shoes are in a puddle of urine. During her conversation and strudel with the man who exterminated her entire family, Shosanna pissed herself.
She drops the German cigarette into the piss puddle by her feet.
INT—CINEMA AUDITORIUM—NIGHT
The SILVER SCREEN
Onscreen is the German screwball comedy “LUCKY KIDS.”
We hear OFFSCREEN laughter at the onscreen Aryan antics.
CU GOEBBELS
watching the screen, basking in his own toxic genius.
CU FRANCESCA
laughing at the comedy, hand covering her mouth.
CU TWO BLACK POODLES
pantingly watching the screen.
CU MAJOR HELLSTROM
smiling, smoking a German cigarette.
CU COL LANDA
smoking a German cigarette, amused.
CU FREDRICK ZOLLER
truly enjoying himself.
CU SHOSANNA
watching the screen.
The LITERARY NARRATOR comes on the soundtrack.
NARRATOR (VO)
While Shosanna sits there pretending
to be amused by the Aryan antics of Goebbel’s Frank Capra copy “Lucky
Kids,” a thought suddenly comes to her.
We see her face get slightly distracted behind the eyes.
NARRATOR (VO)
What if tonight, accidently, the
cinema burned down? The Third Reich would lose its minister of
propaganda, its national hero, and its top Jew hunter, all in one fell swoop.
She chuckles at THAT thought, though it looks like she’s chuckling at the German comedy.
NARRATOR (VO)
But then that thought . . .
. . . led Shosanna
To a crazy idea.
The idea flashes on her face.
Then Shosanna bursts out laughing.
Zoller looks over at her. Happy.
She’s enjoying the movie.
SILVER SCREEN
“The END” card for “Lucky Kids” is projected.
The Nazi rouges’ gallery, and Shosanna, applaud the film.
The lights go up.
Goebbels accepts congratulations, as they stand and begin to file out into the lobby.
NARRATOR (VO)
The screening of “Lucky Kids” was a complete success. And Herr Goebbels conceded to have the venue changed
to Shosanna’s cinema. Not only that,
in a moment of inspiration, Herr Goebbels had an idea.
Goebbels speaks GERMAN, and Francesca translates:
GOEBBELS
I must say, I appreciate the modesty
of this auditorium. Your cinema
has real respect, almost churchlike.
Not to say we couldn’t spruce the
place up a bit. In Versailles
there’s a crystal chandelier hanging
in the banquet hall that is
extraordinary. We’re going to get it
and hang it from the very middle of
the auditorium roof. Also I want to go to the Louvre, pick up a few Greek nudes,
and just scatter them about the lobby.
MONTAGE
We see a quick series of shots that show all that happening.
The chandelier being removed from the ceiling of Versailles.
Greek nude statues being hand-trucked out of the Louvre.
A truck driving through the French countryside with the enormous crystal chandelier in the back.
The lobby of Shosanna’s cinema, pimped out in Nazi iconography. WORKERS buzz around decorating. The Greek statues are moved into place.
We see workers trying with incredible difficulty to hoist the huge, heavy, and twinkingly fragile chandelier in Shosanna’s auditorium, which now resembles something out of one of Tinto Brass’s Italian B-movie ripoffs of Visconti’s “The Damned.”
SHOSANNA
watches all this from an opera box. She shakes her head in disbelief.
BACK TO SHOSANNA AND THE NAZIS
in the lobby, post screening of “Lucky Kids.” She’s soundlessly escorting them to the door as they make their good-byes.
NARRATOR (VO)
As they left the little French
cinema that night, all the Germans
were very happy . . .
We see Pvt. Zoller hanging back, so he can say good-bye.
NARRATOR (VO)
None more so than Fredrick Zoller.
She closes the door on him, watching the Nazis walk into Paris night. Their shadows for a moment on the wall, look like grotesque Nazi caricatures.
The Nazis are gone.
Marcel sits at the top of the staircase of the lobby, looking down at Shosanna.
They speak in FRENCH SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:
MARCEL
What the fuck are we supposed to do?
SHOSANNA
It looks like we’re supposed to have
a Nazi premiere.
MARCEL
Like I said, what the fuck are we supposed to do?
SHOSANNA
Well, I need to speak with you
about that.
MARCEL
About what?
SHOSANNA
About these Hun swine, commandeering
our cinema.
MARCEL
What about it?
She slowly walks up the stairs to Marcel. She makes him part his legs and sits on the lower step, between his legs, her
back up against his chest, his arms around her shoulders, Shosanna has only known this type of intimacy with Marcel.
SHOSANNA
Well, when I was watching that Boche
(said in
English)
Capra-corn abomination,
(back to
French)
I got an idea.
MARCEL
I’m confused. What are we talking
about?
SHOSANNA
Filling the cinema with Nazis and
their whores, and burning it down
to the ground.
MARCEL
I’m not talking about that. You’re talking about that.
SHOSANNA
No, we’re talking about that,
right now. If we can keep this
place from burning down by
ourselves, we can burn it down
by ourselves.
MARCEL
Shosanna—
SHOSANNA
No, Marcel, just for the sake of argument, if we wanted to burn down the cinema
for any number of reasons, you and I could physically accomplish that, no?
MARCEL
Oui, Shosanna, we could do that.
SHOSANNA
And with Madame Mimieux’s three hundred and fifty nitrate film print collection,
we wouldn’t even need explosives, would we?
MARCEL
You mean we wouldn’t need any more explosives?
SHOSANNA
Oui, that’s exactly what I mean.
She begins kissing his hands.
SHOSANNA
(CON’T)
I am going to burn down the cinema
on Nazi night.
One of his fingers probes her mouth.
SHOSANNA
(CON’T)
And if I’m going to burn down the cinema, which I am, we both know
you’re not going to let me do it
by myself.
The back of her head presses up hard against him, as his hand both caresses and grips her lovely neck.
SHOSANNA
(CON’T)
Because you love me. And I love you.
And you’re the only person on this earth I can trust.
She then TWISTS around so she’s straddling him. They are now face to face.
SHOSANNA
(CON’T)
But that’s not all we’re going to do. Does the filmmaking equipment in the attic still work? I know the film
camera does. How about the sound recorder?
MARCEL
Quite well, actually. I recorded a
new guitarist I met in a café last
week. It works superb. Why do we
need filmmaking equipment?
SHOSANNA
Because Marcel, my sweet, we’re
going to make a film. Just for the
Nazis.
She gives him a deep French kiss.
FADE TO BLACK
BLACK FRAME
CHAPTER TITLE APPEARS:
CHAPTER FOUR
“OPERATION KINO”
FADE OFF
INT—ENGLISH COUNTRY ESTATE—DAY
A young MILITARY ATTACHÉ opens the sliding double doors that serve as an entrance to the room.
MILITARY ATTACHÉ
Right this way, Lieutenant.
A snappy, handsome British lieutenant in dress brown steps inside the room. This officer, who has been mixing it up with
the Gerrys since the late thirties, is LT. ARCHIE HICOX,
a young George Sanders type (“The Saint” and “Private Affairs of Bel Ami” years).
Upon entering the room, Lt. Hicox is gobsmacked.
Standing before him is legendary military mastermind
GEN. ED FENECH, an older George Sanders type (“Village of the Damned”).
But in the back of the room, sitting behind a piano, smoking his ever-present cigar, is the unmistakable bulk of WINSTON CHURCHILL.
The lieutenant was not expecting him.
Hicox salutes the general.
LT. HICOX
Lieutenant Hicox reporting, sir.
GEN. FENECH
(salutes back)
General Ed. Fenech. At ease, Hicox. Drink?
Hicox’s eyes go to the formidable bulldog behind the piano, who’s scrutinizing him behind his cigar. However, the man behind the cigar makes no gesture, and the general makes no acknowledgment of the three-hundred-pound gorilla in the room. Which Lt. Hicox knows enough to mean, if Churchill isn’t introduced, he ain’t there.
LT. HICOX
If you offered me a scotch and plain water, I could drink a scotch and plain water.
GEN. FENECH
That a boy, Lieutenant. Make it yourself, like a good chap,
will you? Bar’s in the globe.
Hicox heads over to the bar globe.
LT. HICOX
Something for yourself, sir?
GEN. FENECH
Whiskey straight. No junk in it.
The lieutenant moves over to the Columbus-style globe bar and busies himself mixing spirits, playing bartender chappy.
Fenech, eyeing the lieutenant’s file.
GEN. FENECH
It says here you’ve run three
undercover commando operations in Germany and German-occupied
territories? Frankfurt, Holland,
and Norway, to be exact?
Back to them, mixing drinks, he says:
LT. HICOX
Extraordinary people, the Norwegians.
GEN. FENECH
It says here you speak German fluently?
LT. HICOX
Like a Katzenjammer Kid.
GEN. FENECH
And your occupation before the war?
His back still to us, as he bartends . . .
LT. HICOX
I’m a film critic.
GEN. FENECH
List your accomplishments?
LT. HICOX
Well, sir, such as they are, I write reviews and articles for a publication called “Films and Filmmakers.”
As well as our sister publication.
GEN. FENECH
What’s that called?
LT. HICOX
“Flickers Bi-Monthly,” and I’ve had
two books published.
GEN. FENECH
Impressive. Don’t be modest, Lieutenant. What are their titles?
LT. HICOX
The first book was called “Art of the Eyes, the Heart, and the Mind: A Study of German Cinema in the Twenties.”
And the second one was called . . .
He turns around with his whiskey and plain water and the general’s whiskey no junk. He finishes what he was saying, as
he walks toward the general, handing him his drink.
LT. HICOX
“Twenty-Four Frame Da Vinci.”
It’s a subtextual film criticism
study of the work of German director
G. W. Pabst.
He hands the general his whiskey.
LT. HICOX
What should we drink to, sir?
GEN. FENECH
(thinking, for
a moment)
Down with Hitler.
LT. HICOX
All the way down, sir.
CLINK.
GEN. FENECH
Are you familiar with German cinema under the
Third Reich?
LT. HICOX
Yes. Obviously I haven’t seen any of
the films made in the last three
years, but I am familiar with it.
GEN. FENECH
Explain it to me.
LT. HICOX
Pardon, sir?
GEN. FENECH
This little escapade of ours
requires a knowledge of the German
film industry under the Third Reich. Explain to me UFA, under Goebbels?
LT. HICOX
Goebbels considers the films he’s
making to be the beginning of a new
era in German cinema—an alternative
to what he considers the Jewish
German intellectual cinema of the twenties and the Jewish-controlled
dogma of Hollywood.
SUDDENLY . . . bellowing from the back of the room:
CHURCHILL
How’s he doing?
LT. HICOX
Frightfully sorry, sir, once again?
CHURCHILL
You say he wants to take on the Jews
at their own game? Compared to, say,
. . . Louis B. Mayer . . . how’s he doing?
LT. HICOX
Quite well, actually. Since Goebbels
has taken over, film attendance has steadily risen in Germany over the
last eight years. But Louis B. Mayer wouldn’t be Goebbels’ proper opposite number. I believe Goebbels sees himself closer to David O. Selznick.
Gen. Fenech looks to the prime minister.
With a puff of cigar smoke, Churchill says:
CHURCHILL
Brief him.
GEN. FENECH
Lt. Hicox, at this point in time I’d like to brief you on Operation Kino. Three days from now, Joseph Goebbels is throwing a gala premiere of one of his new movies in Paris—
LT. HICOX
—What film, sir?
The general has to resort to peeking at his file.
GEN. FENECH
The motion pictures called “Nation’s Pride.”
LT. HICOX
Oh, you mean the film about Private Zoller?
GEN. FENECH
We don’t have any intelligence on exactly what
the film that night
will be about.
LT. HICOX
But it’s called “Nation’s Pride”?
GEN. FENECH
Yes.
LT. HICOX
I can tell you what it’s about.
It’s about Private Fredrick Zoller.
He’s the German Sargeant York.
Fenech can’t help suppress a smile. They have the right man.
GEN. FENECH
In attendance at this joyous Germanic occasion will be Goebbels, Goering, Boormann, and most of the German High Command, including all the high-ranking officers of both the S.S. and the Gestapo, as well as luminaries of the Nazi propaganda-film industry.
LT. HICOX
The master race at play, aye?
GEN. FENECH
Basically, we have all our rotten
eggs in one basket. The objective of Operation Kino . . . Blow up the basket.
LT. HICOX
(reciting a
poem)
. . . and like the snows of yesteryear, gone from this earth. Jolly good, sir.
GEN. FENECH
An American Secret Service outfit
that lives deep behind enemy lines
will be your assist. The Germans call them “the Basterds.”
LT. HICOX
“The Basterds.” Never heard of them.
GEN. FENECH
Whole point of the Secret Service,
old boy, you not hearing of them.
But the Gerrys have heard of them, because
these Yanks have	been them
the devil. Their	leader is	a chap
named Lieutenant	Aldo Raine. The
Germans call him	“Aldo the	Apache.”
LT. HICOX
Why do they call	him that?
GEN. FENECH
Best guess is because he removes the scalps of the Nazi dead.
LT. HICOX
Scalps, sir?
GEN. FENECH
The hair.
He runs his finger along his hairline.
GEN. FENECH
Like a red Injun.
LT. HICOX
Rather gruesome-sounding little dickybird, isn’t he?
GEN. FENECH
No doubt the whole lot, a bunch of nutters. But you’ve heard the
expression “It takes a thief.”
LT. HICOX
Indeed.
Gen. Fenech continues on with his exposition, moving over to a military map.
GEN. FENECH
You’ll be dropped into Franch about twenty-four kilometers outside of Paris. The Basterds will be waiting for you. First thing, you go to a little village called Nadine.
(He points it out
on the map.)
Apparently the Gerrys never go there.
In Nadine, there’s a tavern called
La Louisiane. You’ll rendezvous
with our double agent, and she’ll take it from there. She’s the one who’s
going to get you into the premiere.
It will be you, her, and two German-
born members of the Basterds. She’s
also made all the other arrangements you’re going to need.
LT. HICOX
How will I know her?
GEN. FENECH
I suspect that won’t be too much
trouble for you. Your contract is Bridget von Hammersmark.
LT. HICOX
Bridget von Hammersmark? The German movie star is working for England?
GEN. FENECH
For the last two years now. One could even say Operation Kino was her brainchild.
In the back of the room the bulldog barks:
CHURCHILL
Extraordinary woman.
LT. HICOX
Quite.
GEN. FENECH
You’ll go to the premiere as her
escort, lucky devil. She’ll also
have the premiere tickets for the
other two. Got the gist?
LT. HICOX
I think so, sir. Paris when it sizzles.
The three British bulldogs laugh.
EXT—CINEMA ROOFTOP—DAY
Shosanna and Marcel are on the rooftop of their cinema literally making a movie.
Marcel is behind an old (even then) BOLEX 35MM MOVIE CAMERA, positioned low, looking up.
Shosanna, the camera subject, stands on boxes looking down into it.
A old-timey MICROPHONE is positioned out of frame.
As they always do, and always will, they speak FRENCH SUBTITLED into you know what.
MARCEL
We need a sync mark.
SHOSANNA
What is a sync mark?
MARCEL
An action and noise put together,
So we can sync up the picture
and sound.
SHOSANNA
How do we do that?
MARCEL
Clap your hands.
She does.
MARCEL
In frame, imbecile.
She claps her hands in front of her face.
MARCEL
Ready?
Shosanna takes a deep breath, then:
SHOSANNA
Ready.
MARCEL
Action.
WE CUT, BEFORE SHE SPEAKS, TO . . .
THE SCENE EARLIER BETWEEN MARCEL AND SHOSANNA IN THE
LOBBY, ON THE STAIRS, TALKING ABOUT BURNING DOWN THE CINEMA.
Big difference. This time, it’s in COLOR.
MARCEL
But how do we get it developed?
Only a suicidal idiot like us would develop that footage. How do we get
a 35mm print with a soundtrack?
SHOSANNA
Do you know one person who can do
both things?
MARCEL
Of course, Gaspar. Very nice man,
took care of all the experimental filmmakers.
But nobody in their
right mind would strike a print of
what you’re talking about. If the
Nazis found out, their life wouldn’t
be worth this.
He snaps his fingers.
SHOSANNA
In a wolf fight, you either eat the
wolf or the wolf eats you. If we’re going to obliterate the Nazis,
we have to use their tactics.
MARCEL
What does that mean?
SHOSANNA
We find somebody who can develop
and process a 35mm print. And we
make them do it or we kill them.
Once we tell them what we want to
do if they refuse, we have to kill
them anyway or they’ll turn us in.
MARCEL
Would you do that?
SHOSANNA
Like that.
Snaps her fingers.
INT—SMALL FILM-PROCESSING LAB—LATE NIGHT
A	old mom-and-pop film processing lab circa the thirties. Late late at night.
GASPAR, the fatherly figure of all the experimental French filmmakers in the decade before German rule, takes a SAVAGE BEATING at the hands of his friend Marcel.
Shosanna watches, pitiless.
SHOSANNA
Bring that fucker over here!
Put his head down on that table.
Marcel holds Gaspar’s arm behind him as he forces his head flat against the tabletop.
Shosanna brings a HATCHET DOWN DEEP into the table, just by his face.
SHOSANNA
You either do what the fuck we tell
you to, or I’ll bury this ax in your
collaborating skull.
GASPAR
I’m not a collaborator!
SHOSANNA
Then prove it! Or does your manhood
go no deeper than standing to piss? Marcel, do
his wife and children
know you?
MARCEL
Oui.
SHOSANNA
Then after we kill this dog for
Germans, we’ll go and silence them.
She lifts up the hatchet, raises it high . . .
SHOSANNA
Prepare to die, collaborator fucker!
CUT TO
GASPAR
hands the couple a SMALL SILVER CAN OF 35MM FILM, Outside the shop window, it’s morning.
INT—PROJECTION ROOM
WE SEE the five heavy silver film cans of Fredrick Zoller’s life story, “Nation’s Pride” (clearly marked), on the floor of the projection booth.
The can for REEL 4 is open and empty.
Shosanna’s at the editing bench. REEL 4 is up on the rewinds . . .
Shosanna SPLICES her and Marcel’s footage into REEL 4 of Fredrick’s film, rewinds it, puts it back in the can, and
puts a piece of RED TAPE on the REEL 4 CAN.
She walks out of the booth, turning off the lights behind her, PLUNGING THE SCREEN INTO DARKNESS.
BLACK FRAME
FROM BLACK DISSOLVE TO
EXT—LA LOUISIANE (TAVERN)—NIGHT
We see a small basement tavern with an old rustic sign out front that reads “La Louisiane.”
A SUBTITLE APPEARS:
“The village of
Nadine, France”
TWO SHOT LT. HICOX and LT. ALDO RAINE
Aldo is dressed like a French civilian. Hicox is dressed in a German gray S.S. captain’s uniform. They look out of a window, in an apartment, in the village of Nadine, overlooking the tavern.
LT. ALDO
You didn’t say the goddamn rendezvous was in a fuckin’ basement.
LT. HICOX
I didn’t know.
LT. ALDO
You said it was in a tavern?
LT. HICOX
It is a tavern.
LT. ALDO
Yeah, in a basement. You know,
fightin’ in a basement offers a lot
of difficulties, number one being
you’re fighting in a basement.
Wilhelm Wicki joins the SHOT, dressed in a German S.S. lieutenant’s uniform.
WICKI
What if we go in there and she’s
not even there?
LT. HICOX
We wait. Don’t worry. She’s a British spy.
She’ll make the rendezvous.
WE SEE that the other Basterds, dressed in French civilian clothes, are in the room as well. They are Donowitz, Hirschberg,
and Utivich. And in the back of the room, dressed in the gray uniform of an S.S. lieutenant, Hugo Stiglitz sits off by himself, sharpening his S.S. DAGGER on his leather belt, looped around his boot. Anybody not in the scene from the Basterd’s opening chapter is dead.
Lt. Hicox watches Stiglitz off by himself on the other side of the room SHARPENING his dagger menacingly.
Stiglitz is fucking weird . . .
Lt. Hicox approaches Stiglitz . . .
LT. HICOX
Stiglitz, right?
STIGLITZ
That’s right, sir.
He continues bringing the blade’s edge up, then down on the leather strap.
LT. HICOX
I hear you’re pretty good with that?
Meaning the blade.
Stiglitz doesn’t answer.
LT. HICOX
You know, we’re not looking for
trouble right now. We’re simply
making contact with our agent.
Should be uneventful. However, on
the off chance I’m wrong and things prove eventful, I need to know we can all remain calm.
The renegade Gerry sergeant stops his blade’s progress and looks up at the limey lieutenant.
STIGLITZ
I don’t look calm to you?
LT. HICOX
Well, now you put it like that, I guess you do.
He turns his attention back to his blade.
Hicox moves over to Aldo and asks him privately:
LT. HICOX
This Gerry of yours, Stiglitz?
Not exactly the loquacious type,
is he?
Aldo just looks at him.
LT. ALDO
Is that the kinda man you need, the loquacious type?
LT. HICOX
Fair point, Lieutenant.
LT. ALDO
So y’all git in trouble in there,
what are we supposed to do?
Make bets on how it all comes out?
LT. HICOX
If we get into trouble, we can
handle it. But if trouble does
happen, we need you to make damn
sure no Germans or French, for that matter— escape from that basement.
If Fräulein von Hammersmark’s cover is
compromised, the mission is kaput.
Donny chimes in:
SGT. DONOWITZ
Speaking of Fräulein von Hammersmark, whose idea was it for the death trap rendezvous?
LT. HICOX
She chose the spot.
SGT. DONOWITZ
Well, isn’t that just dandy?
LT. HICOX
Look, she’s not a military strategist. She’s just an actress.
LT. ALDO
Ya don’t got to be Stonewall
Jackson to know you don’t want to
fight in a basement.
LT. HICOX
She wasn’t picking a place to fight.
She was picking a place isolated
and without Germans.
PFC. HIRSCHBERG
Lieutenant, I hate to be contrary,
but I got me a Nazi pissin’ on
Louisiana two o’clock.
They move to the window, and sure enough, ONE LONE NAZI PRIVATE relieves himself against the side wall.
Lt. Hicox, this was definitely not the plan.
LT. HICOX
Shit.
Sgt. Donowitz chides him:
SGT. DONOWITZ
So what do you think your Fräulein
von Hammer—
LT. HICOX
—Obviously, I don’t know, Sergeant.
The British officer watches the German soldier, who’s not supposed to be there. When Hugo Stiglitz joins him at the window, Stiglitz looks down at the urinating Nazi, S.S. dagger in hand.
