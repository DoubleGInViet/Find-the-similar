STIGLITZ
If we’re going, let’s go.
He sheaths the dagger.
EXT—LA LOUISIANE (BASEMENT TAVERN)—NIGHT
The GERMAN PISSING PRIVATE sloppily finishes his task. Cramming his noodle back in his pants, he descends the stairs that lead him back into the basement tavern. We follow him . . .
INT—LA LOUISIANE (BASEMENT TAVERN)—NIGHT
Inside the basement tavern La Louisiane. It has a very low-hanging basement ceiling. A old-looking wood bar off to the right. And the only other space in the little tavern is taken
up by two large (at least in here) tables, which take up both halves of the room. And despite rumors to the contrary, one of the two tables is completely filled with drunken, celebrating
Nazi enlisted men, of which our urinating friend is one of five.
FIVE NAZIS
ONE GERMAN MASTER SERGEANT, ONE FEMALE GERMAN SERGEANT (a powerfully built, stocky type), and THREE MALE GERMAN SOLDIERS.
The five Nazis are sitting around the table, drinking, and playing a very fun game with none other than the Fräulein of the hour, UFA diva BRIDGET VON HAMMERSMARK, dressed to the
nines in a chic, forties-style woman’s suit, complete with fedora. The game they’re playing consists of each player having
a card with the name of a famous person, real or imaginary, stuck to their forehead. The player doesn’t know what name is on their forehead. So they ask the others questions to figure out who they are.
The five Germans’ five cards read: MASTER SGT #1: (POLA NEGRI);
FEMALE SGT #2: (BEETHOVEN); GERMAN PRIVATE #3: (MATA HARI);
GERMAN PRIVATE #4: (EDGAR WALLACE); GERMAN PRIVATE #5:
(WINNETOU). And Bridget von Hammersmark, who wears her card in
the brim of her fedora, has GENGHIS KHAN.
It’s German #5’s (WINNETOU) turn to ask questions.
The DIALOGUE will be in GERMAN and SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH.
WINNETOU
. . . okay, I’m not German. Am I American?
The whole table bursts out laughing.
FEMALE SGT. BEETHOVEN
Yes, you are!
EDGAR WALLACE
Well, not really.
SGT. POLA NEGRI
What do you mean, not really? Of
course he is.
EDGAR WALLACE
Well, if he’s so American, how come
he’s never been translated into
English. He’s not American. He’s supposed to be American, but he’s not
an American creation. In fact, he’s something very different.
WINNETOU
Okay, I’m a fictional, literary character, from the past. I’m American, and that’s controversial.
BRIDGET/GENGUS
No, it’s not controversial. The nationality of the author has nothing to do with
the nationality of the character.
The character is the character.
Hamlet’s not British, he’s Danish.
So, yes, this character was born in
America.
WINNETOU
Well, I’m glad that’s settled. If I had a wife, would she be called a squaw?
He’s got it.
The table laughs.
THE TABLE
YES!
WINNETOU
Is my blood brother Old Shatterhand?
THE TABLE
Yes!
WINNETOU
Did Karl May write me?
THE TABLE
Yes!
In the BACKGROUND, WE SEE our three counterfeit German officers—Hicox, Wicki, and Stiglitz—enter the basement
tavern. They obviously see the five German soldiers, but they’re too far away for us (the audience) to read their faces. No doubt they’re less than happy. Fräuhlein von Hammersmark sees them as well. Without getting up, she waves to them.
BRIDGET
Hello, my lovelies. I will join you
in moments. I’m finishing up a game
with my five new friends here.
LT. HICOX
No hurry, Fräulein von Hammersmark.
Take your time. Enjoy yourself.
BRIDGET
(to Winnetou)
So who are you?
WINNETOU
I am WINNETOU, CHIEF of the APACHES!
The table CHEERS and APPLAUDS the Apache chief as he takes the card off his forehead.
The other four German soldiers drink down their beer (part of the game).
Bridget von Hammersmark knocks back her champagne.
MATA HARI
Fräulein von Hammersmark, when your friends came in, did you realize
you did a double take, like in the movies?
BRIDGET
Really? No, I wasn’t aware of that
at all.
MATA HARI
They must be second nature to you now. Did they teach you how to do a double take in the movies?
BRIDGET
Well, yes, they did, but it’s not really that difficult.
SGT. POLA NEGRI
Do one for us.
The table heartily agrees.
Bridget looks directly at the master sergeant and does a perfect, and perfectly funny, double take.
The table loves it.
MATA HARI
My turn, I want to try.
Mata Hari looks directly at Beethoven and does a double take.
EDGAR WALLACE
I want to try.
He does.
Soon the whole table is doing dueling double takes.
HICOX—WICKI—STIGLITZ
watch the table do dueling double takes. Obviously, they don’t understand.
THEN...
Bridget von Hammersmark rises and excuses herself from the table. She removes the card stuck in her fedora, looking at the name for the first time. Genghis Khan.
BRIDGET
Genghis Khan! I would never have gotten that.
She walks over and joins the masquerading Germans’ table. The gentlemen rise. She greets each warmly with a French cheek kiss, as if she knows them well.
They all take a seat. The two basterds and one Brit drink whiskey. The tavern’s PROPRIETOR, an older, big-bellied
Frenchman named EARL, comes over to the table and pours more champagne into Bridget’s champagne glass. He leaves, returning back behind the bar, with the YOUNG FRENCH BARMAID, the only other person in the establishment.
Obviously, they speak GERMAN, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:
LT. HICOX
I thought this place was supposed to have more
French than Germans?
BRIDGET
Normally that’s	true. The sergeant over there’s
wife just	had a	baby. His commanding officer
gave him and his
mates the	night	off to celebrate.
We should	leave.	WICKI
BRIDGET
No, we should stay. For one drink at least. I’ve been waiting for you in a bar. It would look strange if we left before we had a drink.
LT. HICOX
She’s right. Just be calm, and enjoy your booze.
BACK TO THE GERMAN TABLE
The French barmaid has taken Bridget’s place in the rousing, rowdy game. She tells them her person must be French or she
won’t know them. Winnetou thinks for a moment, then writes a name on a card. The barmaid puts it on her forehead. It says:
NAPOLEON.
The Germans all laugh.
BACK TO THE BASTERDS’ TABLE
BRIDGET
There’s been some new developments.
The cinema venue has changed.
LT. HICOX
Why?
BRIDGET
No one knows. But that in itself shouldn’t be a problem. The cinema
it’s been changed to is considerably smaller than The Ritz. So whatever materials you brought for The Ritz should be doubly effective here.
Now this next piece of information
is colossal, try not to overreact.
The Führer will be attending tomorrow.
Hugo Stiglitz does a SPIT-TAKE.
Bridget’s eyes bore holes in him.
BACK TO THE REAL GERMANS
They see Hugo do the spit-take and burst out laughing. Keeping it up, they begin to do dueling spit-takes, like they did dueling double takes earlier. Needless to say, they all get wet.
BACK TO THE BASTERDS
BRIDGET
(to Hicox)
You’ll be going as Ernst Schuller. You’ll say you’re an associate producer on Riefenstahl’s “Tiefland.” It’s the
one German production not under Goebbels’ control, and Leni wouldn’t be caught dead at a Goebbels film affair.
BACK TO THE REAL GERMAN TABLE
Master Sgt. Pola Negri drinks his beer as he looks over, dreamily, at Bridget von Hammersmark at the other table.
BACK TO THE BASTERDS
Bridget continues to brief Hicox on his identity. We see in
the B.G. the German master sergeant stand up from his table and head toward Fräulein von Hammersmark.
BRIDGET
. . . the film’s gone through many delays, and Leni’s health is deteriorating, so if you have to speak . . .
Hicox, seeing the German master sergeant approach, signals for her to cool it.
SGT. POLA NEGRI
Fräulein von Hammersmark, I was just thinking, could you sign an autograph
to my son on his birthday?
BRIDGET
I’d love to, Wilhelm.
(to the table)
This handsome happy sergeant just became a father today.
The pretend officers offer congratulations to the sergeant.
The German master sergeant CLICKS his heels and bows before his superior officers.
SGT. POLA NEGRI
Thank you. Heil Hitler.
He raises his hand . . . as do the seated phony officers: “Heil Hitler.”
As she takes a rather fancy fountain pen from her clutch . . .
BRIDGET
So, Wilhelm, do you know the name of this progeny yet?
SGT. POLA NEGRI
I most certainly do, Fräulein. His
name is Maximilian.
Even the slightly psychotic Stiglitz likes this German sergeant.
STIGLITZ
Wonderful name, Sergeant.
SGT. POLA NEGRI
Thank you, Lieutenant. When he’s old enough to ride a bicycle, I will buy
him a blue one. And I will paint on
the side “The Blue Max.”
He thrusts out his beer stein, for the officers to cheer.
They do.
Bridget finishes signing her autograph, with a big flourish.
BRIDGET
There you go. But wait, I’m not finished yet.
She reaches into her clutch and pulls out some lipstick, applies some ruby-red color to her lips, and then kisses the napkin, leaving a big red lip print. Then she hands the treasured item to the young officer.
BRIDGET
Nothing but the best for little Maximilian.
SGT. POLA NEGRI
Thank you, Fräulein, thank you. Max may not know who you are now. But he will.
I will show him all of your movies.
He will grow up with your films,
and this napkin on his wall.
Then, to the whole tavern . . .
SGT. POLA NEGRI
I propose a toast to the greatest actress in
Germany! There is no Dietrich, there is no
Riefenstahl, only von Hammersmark!
The whole room toasts.
This would be a good time for the German sergeant to go back to his table and his men. And he almost does . . . but . . . since he is drunk, and star struck, he out wears his welcome.
SGT. POLA NEGRI
So, Fräulein von Hammersmark, what brings you to France?
Feeling any good Nazi officer’s patience would have been exhausted long ago, Lt. Hicox butts in.
LT. HICOX
None of your business, Sergeant.
You might not have worn out your welcome with the fräulein with your drunken, boorish behavior, but you have worn out your welcome with me.
The table of game-playing soldiers hears this and gets quiet.
LT. HICOX
Might I remind you Sergeant, you’re an enlisted man.
This is an officers’ table. I suggest
you stop pestering the fräulein and
rejoin your table.
The German master sergeant looks quizzically at the officer.
SGT. POLA NEGRI
Excuse me, Captain, but your accent is very unusual.
The whole room pauses . . . for different reasons . . .
SGT. POLA NEGRI
Where are you from?
A silent moment passes between the two tables, then the two German-born imposters spring into action.
WICKI
Sergeant! You must be either drunk or mad to speak to a superior officer with
such impertinence!
Stiglitz, STANDS and YELLS to the other table:
STIGLITZ
I’m making YOU . . .
(pointing at
Winnetou)
. . . and YOU . . .
(pointing at
Edgar Wallace)
. . . responsible for him.
(pointing at
Sgt. Pola)
I suggest you take hold of your friend, or he’ll spend Max’s first birthday
in jail for public drunkenness!
The Germans SPRING UP and take hold of Sgt. Pola . . .
WHEN...
A GERMAN VOICE rings out:
GERMAN VOICE (OS)
Then might I inquire?
The five known Germans move aside, revealing the unknown German in the room, unseen till now, our old friend from before:
MAJOR DIETER HELLSTROM of the GESTAPO. The major stands from the little table he was sitting at.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
Like the young, newly christened father, I to have an acute ear for accents.
And like him, I too find yours odd.
From where do you hail, Captain?
Wicki jumps in:
WICKI
Major, this is highly inappr—
MAJOR HELLSTROM
—I wasn’t speaking to you,
Lieutenant Saltzberg,
(turning to
Stiglitz)
or you either, Lieutenant Berlin.
(looking at
Hicox)
I was speaking to Captain I-don’t-know-what.
The Gestapo major is now standing beside Sgt. Pola, before the imposter’s table.
Lt. Hicox calmly explains his origin.
LT. HICOX
I was born in the village that rests
in the shadow of Pitz Palu.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
The mountain?
LT. HICOX
Yes. In that village we all speak like this.
Have you seen the Riefenstahl film?
MAJOR HELLSTROM
Yes.
LT. HICOX
Then you saw me. You remember the skiing torch scene?
MAJOR HELLSTROM
Yes, I do.
LT. HICOX
In that scene were myself, my father,
my sister, and my two brothers. My brother is so handsome, the director, Pabst, gave him a closeup.
As Bridget von Hammersmark places a cigarette in an ivory cigarette holder—which Hicox, as if on cue, lights for her
she says:
BRIDGET
Major, if my word means anything, I can vouch for everything the young captain has just said. He does hail from the bottom of Pitz Palu, he was in the film, and his brother is far more handsome than he.
The imposters laugh.
Then . . . so does the Gestapo major. He turns to the sergeant.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
You should rejoin your friends.
Which the young sergeant is more than happy to do. That table begins playing their game again.
Major Hellstrom, the highest-ranking officer in the room, bows graciously to the female German celebrity.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
May I join you?
BRIDGET
By all means, Major.
The Gestapo major sits at the table, opposite Lt. Hicox and Wicki.
The French barmaid brings over the Major’s beer stein.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
So that’s the source of your bizarre accent?
Extraordinary. So what are
you doing here, Captain?
LT. HICOX
Aside from having a drink with the lovely fräulein?
MAJOR HELLSTROM
Well, that pleasure requires no explanation.
Chuckle . . . chuckle
MAJOR HELLSTROM
I mean in country. You’re obviously not
stationed in France, or I’d know who
you are.
LT. HICOX
You know every German in France?
MAJOR HELLSTROM
Worth knowing.
LT. HICOX
Well, therein lies the problem. We
never claimed to be worth knowing.
Chuckle . . . chuckle.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
(chuckling as
he asks)
All levity aside, what are you doing
in France?
LT. HICOX
Attending Goebbels’s film premiere as
the fräulein’s escort.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
You’re the fräulein’s escort?
LT. HICOX
Somebody has to carry the lighter.
Chuckle . . . chuckle.
BRIDGET
The captain is my date, but all three are my guests. We’re old friends, Major, who go back a long time. Longer than
an actress would care to admit.
Chuckle . . . chuckle.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
Well, in that case, let me raise a glass to the three luckiest men in the room.
BRIDGET
I’ll drink to that.
They cheers.
BACK TO THE REAL GERMANS’ TABLE
They continue to have a lot of fun playing their game.
BACK TO THE OFFICERS’ TABLE
MAJOR HELLSTROM
I must say, that game they’re playing
looks like a good bit of fun. I didn’t
join them, because you’re quite right, Captain, officers and enlisted men shouldn’t fraternize. But seeing as we’re all officers here,
(bowing to
Bridget)
. . . and sophisticated lady friends of
officers, what say we play the game?
Lt. Hicox begins to refuse when Bridget (feeling she knows better)
interrupts him:
BRIDGET
Okay, one game.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
Wunderbar.
The major borrows five cards from the other table and lays them out in front of Bridget and the officers.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
So the object of the game is to write
the name of a famous person on your card. Real or fictitious, doesn’t matter. For instance, you could write Confucius or Fu Manchu.
(He SNAPS his fingers.)
Eric! More pens.
(back to the players)
And they must be famous. No Aunt Ingas. When you finish writing, put the card face down on the table and move it to the person to your left. The person to your right will move their card in
front of you. You pick up the card without looking at it, lick the back, and stick it on your forehead, like so.
He demonstrates.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
(con’t)
And in ten yes or no questions, you must guess who you are . . .
As Maj. Hellstrom finishes explaining the finer points of the game, a CAMERA PANS OFF HIM and BEGINS SLOWLY ZOOMING INTO STIGLITZ. The major’s dialogue begins to FADE AWAY.
Until we’re in a SPAGHETTI WESTERN FLASHBACK. Which is RED-FILTERED FOOTAGE of Hugo being savagely WHIPPED by somebody wearing a GESTAPO UNIFORM, SUPERIMPOSED over his CLOSEUP.
The flashback disappears. It’s driving Stiglitz crazy, being this close to a Gestapo uniform and not plunging a knife into it.
The major’s voice comes back on the soundtrack.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
. . . So let’s give it a try, shall we?
Everybody write your names.
The five players write their names . . .
Then move their cards to the left . . .
Everybody sticks their cards on their forehead . . .
MAJOR	BRIDGET	WILHELM	ARCHIE	HUGO

is	is	is	is	is
KING	G.W.	BULLDOG	BRIGITTE	MARCO

MAJ. KING KONG
I’ll start, give you the idea.
Am I German?
They laugh.
BRIDGET
No.
MAJ. KING KONG
Am I an American?
They laugh—but then Wicki says:
WICKI
Wait a minute, he goes to—
BRIDGET
Don’t be ridiculous. Obviously he wasn’t born in America.
MAJ. KING KONG
So . . . I visited America, aye?
The table says, “Yes.”
MAJ. KING KONG
Was this visit . . . fortuitous?
WICKI
Not for you.
MAJ. KING KONG
. . . Hummm. My native land, is it what one would call exotic?
The table confers and decides, yes, it is exotic.
MAJ. KING KONG
Hummm. That could be either a reference to the jungle or the Orient. I’m going to let my first instinct take over and ask, am I from the jungle?
The table says, “Yes, you are.”
MAJ. KING KONG
Now gentlemen, around this time you could ask whether you’re real or fictitious.
I, however, think that’s too easy, so I won’t ask that, yet. Okay, my native land is the jungle. I visited America, but my visit was not fortuitous to me, but the implication is that it was to somebody else. When I went from the jungle to America, . . . did I go by boat?
“Yes.”
MAJ. KING KONG
Did I go against my will?
“Yes.”
MAJ. KING KONG
On this boat ride . . . Was I in chains?
“Yes.”
MAJ. KING KONG
When I arrived in America . . . was I displayed in chains?
“Yes.”
MAJ. KING KONG
Am I the story of the Negro in America?
The table says, “No.”
MAJ. KING KONG
Well, then, I must be King Kong.
He throws the card on the table.
They applaud him.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
Now since I answered correctly, you all need to finish your drinks.
The three counterfeit Nazis knock back their whiskeys.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
Now, who’s next?
LT. HICOX
Major, I don’t mean to be rude. But the four of us are very good friends. And the four of us haven’t seen each other in quite a while. So .
. .
Major, I’m afraid, you are intruding.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
I beg to differ, Captain. It’s only if the fräulein considers my presence an intrusion that I become an intruder. How about it, Fräulein? Am I intruding?
BRIDGET
Of course not, Major.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
I didn’t think so. It’s simply the young captain is immune to my charms.
The table’s not sure what to do. Is this a confrontation?
Then the major laughs.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
I’m just joking. Of course, I’m intruding.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
Allow me to refill your glasses, gentlemen, and I will bid you and the fräulein adieu.
(leaning in)
Eric has a bottle of thirty-three-year-old single-malt scotch whiskey from the Scottish highlands. What do you say, gentlemen?
LT. HICOX
You’re most gracious, sir.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
Eric, the thirty-three and new glasses! You don’t want to contaminate the thirty-three with the swill you were drinking.
ERIC
How many glasses?
LT. HICOX
Five glasses.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
Not me. I like scotch, scotch doesn’t like me.
BRIDGET
Nor I. I’ll stay with bubbly.
Lt. Hicox holds up three fingers (pinky to middle finger) to Eric, the owner.
LT. HICOX
Three glasses.
Eric brings the three glasses and the old bottle, pouring for the three soldiers.
Major Hellstrom lifts up his beer stein and toasts:
MAJOR HELLSTROM
To a thousand-year Reich!
They all mutter, “a thousand-year reich” and clink glasses.
The Gestapo major puts down his beer stein, and then WE HEAR a CLICK under the table.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
Did you hear that? That’s the sound of
my WALTER pointed right at your testicles.
LT. HICOX
Why do you have a Luger pointed at my
testicles?
MAJOR HELLSTROM
Because you’ve just given yourself
away, captain. You’re no more German than scotch.
LT. HICOX
Well, Major—
BRIDGET
—Major—
MAJOR HELLSTROM
—Shut up, slut.
(to Hicox)
You were saying?
LT. HICOX
I was saying that makes two of us. I’ve had a gun pointed at your balls since you sat down.
SGT. STIGLITZ
That makes three of us.
UNDER THE TABLE
We see all three guns pointed at the appropriate crotches, as well as Bridget’s legs, right besides the Nazi major’s. Her pretty gams are sure to be chewed up in the possible crossfire.
SGT. STIGLITZ
And at this range, I’m a real
Fredrick Zoller.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
Hummm . . . Looks like we have a bit
of a sticky situation here.
LT. HICOX
What’s going to happen, Major, is you’re going to stand up and walk out that
door with us.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
No, no,	no, no,	no, no,	I don’t think	so. I’m
afraid you	and I both know, no matter	what
happens	to	anybody else	in this room,	the two of
us aren’t going	anywhere.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
(pointing at the table
behind him)
Too bad about Sgt. Wilhelm and his friends.
If any of you expect to live, you’ll have to shoot them too.
(pause)
Looks like little Max is going to grow up an orphan. How sad.
BRIDGET
Then, Major, I implore you. For the
sake of those German troops, will
you please leave with us?
MAJOR HELLSTROM
Oh, Bridget, your concern for German troops gets me . . .
(pointing at
his heart)
. . . right here. You mean for the sake of your whore legs, don’t you? You can’t afford to get any bullet holes in them. You’re not finished spreading them for all the Hollywood Jews.
Lt. Hicox picks up his thirty-three-year-old single-malt scotch and says:
LT. HICOX
(ENGLISH)
Well, if this is it, old boy, I hope
you don’t mind if I go out speaking
the king’s?
MAJOR HELLSTROM
(ENGLISH)
By all means, Captain.
The English film critic commando picks up the thirty-three the Nazi major bought him and says:
LT. HICOX
There’s a special rung in hell reserved for people who waste good scotch.
And seeing as I might be rapping on
the door momentarily . . .
He downs the stuff.
LT. HICOX
(to the Nazi
major)
I must say, damn good stuff, sir.
He puts the glass down.
LT. HICOX
Now about this pickle we find
ourselves in. It would appear there’s only one thing left for you to do.
MAJOR HELLSTROM
(ENGLISH)
And what would that be?
LT. HICOX
Stiglitz.
STIGLITZ
Say, “auf Widersehen” to your balls!
STIGLITZ
FIRES into HELLSTROM’S BALLS . . .
As does HICOX, HITTING not only Hellstrom, but BRIDGET as well.
HELLSTROM
FIRES into HICOX’s BALLS and KNEECAPS.
STIGLITZ
then JUMPS over the table and begins STABBING HELLSTROM with the
DAGGER.
HICOX FALLS to the floor . . . DEAD.
BRIDGET FALLS to the floor . . . SHOT.
WICKI
brings his weapon out from underneath the table and BEGINS
FIRING across at the GERMANS at the table, who, unaware, were still
PLAYING THE GAME.
WINNETOU
is SHOT IN THE BACK, before he even knows what is happening.
EDGAR WALLACE is SHOT by WICKI.
SGT. POLA NEGRI
FALLS to the floor in the confusion.
FEMALE SGT. BEETHOVEN and STIGLITZ bring their guns toward each other and FIRE. They BOTH TAKE and GIVE each other so many BULLETS it’s almost romantic when they collapse DEAD on the floor.
WICKI and MATA HARI
both ON THEIR FEET, FIRING WILDLY at each other. MATA HARI is HIT THREE TIMES. WICKI is HIT ONCE.
SGT. POLA NEGRI
comes off the floor with a SUBMACHINE GUN and SPRAYS the
whole other side of the room, WIPING OUT WICKI, ERIC, MATA HARI, and THE BARMAID.
The SHOOTING STOPS . . . THE SMOKE caused by the gunfire . . . starts to DISSIPATE . . . The only one in the room left alive is the
young German sergeant with the machine gun.
WE HEAR the feet of the soldiers outside reach the basement entrance.
The door opens . . .
The German sergeant sends FIFTY BULLETS in the door’s direction . . .
No one goes through it.
What we have here is a rabbit-hole-like situation. No one inside is getting out. No one outside is getting in.
The young German sergeant YELLS in ENGLISH to the outside:
GERMAN SERGEANT
You outside! Who are you? British, American, what?
Aldo’s voice YELLS down the hole:
ALDO’S VOICE (OS)
We’re Americans! What are you?
GERMAN SERGEANT
I’m a German, you idiot!
ALDO’S VOICE (OS)
You speak English pretty good for a German!
GERMAN SERGEANT
I agree! So let’s talk!
ALDO’S VOICE (OS)
Okay, talk!
GERMAN SERGEANT
I’m a father! My baby was born today
in Frankfurt! Five hours ago! His name is Max! We were in here drinking and celebrating! They’re the ones that
came in shooting and killing!
It’s not my fault!
ALDO’S VOICE (OS)
Okay, okay, it wasn’t your fault!
What’s your name, soldier?
GERMAN SERGEANT
Wilhelm!
ALDO’S VOICE (OS)
That’s the same name as one of the
guys you just killed!
WILHELM
They attacked us!
ALDO’S VOICE (OS)
Okay, Wilhelm . . . is anybody alive
on our side?
WILHELM
No!
We hear a VOICE OFFSCREEN yell out:
BRIDGET’S VOICE (OS)
I’m alive!
Wilhelm spins in the direction of the voice.
On the floor, with a bullet in her BLOODY LEG, lies the still-alive Bridget von Hammersmark.
The German sergeant points the muzzle of the machine gun at the German celebrity, with hate in his eyes.
ALDO’S VOICE (OS)
Who’s that?
WILHELM
(to BRIDGET,
low)
Make a sound, whore, and I spit!
Meaning the muzzle.
ALDO’S VOICE (OS)
Wilhelm, who is that?
WILHELM
Is the girl on your side?
Pause.
ALDO’S VOICE (OS)
Which girl?
WILHELM
Who do you think—von Hammersmark!
ALDO’S VOICE (OS)
Yeah, she’s ours!
WILHELM
(to Bridget,
LOW, in GERMAN)
I thought so. So you run with the Americans now, huh? Now times are
bad?
ALDO’S VOICE (OS)
Is she okay?
WILHELM
(to Bridget,
LOW, in GERMAN)
You despicable traitor.
(to Aldo)
She’s been shot, but she’s alive.
(to Bridget,
LOW, in GERMAN)
For now.
We hear the Basterds curse their luck offscreen.
ALDO’S VOICE (OS)
Okay, Wilhelm, what’d ya say we
make a deal?
WILHELM
What’s your name?
ALDO’S VOICE (OS)
Aldo. Wilhelm, can I call ya Willi?
WILHELM
Yes.
ALDO’S VOICE (OS)
So, Willi, you know we could lob three or four or five or six grenades down there and your little war story ends here. But good fer you, bad fer her.
You die, she dies. So what say we
make a swap?
WILLI
Keep talking!
ALDO’S VOICE (OS)
Okay, Willi, here’s my deal! You let
me and one of my men come down to
take the girl away! And we take the
girl and leave! That simple, Willi!
You go your way, we go ours! And little Max gets to grow up playing catch with his daddy! So what ‘ya say, Willi, we got a deal?
Willi thinks . . .
Bridget watches Willi think . . .
WILLI
Aldo?
ALDO’S VOICE (OS)
I’m here, Willi!
WILLI
I want to trust you . . . But how can I?
ALDO’S VOICE (OS)
What choice ya got?
WILLI
I could kill the girl!
ALDO’S VOICE (OS)
Well, now, Willi, that’s true enough. But something you need to know, so
you don’t get the wrong idea. Ain’t
none of us give a fuck ‘bout that
girl. But, admittedly, if you kill
her, it would fuck up our plans. But you’ll be dead by then anyway, so
what’d you care? And let’s not
forget that little Katzenjammer
Max, growin’ up without a pop. So in
the spirit of gettin’ you home to
him, we got a deal, Willi?
WILLI
Okay, Aldo. I’m going to trust you!
Come down, no guns!
Aldo and Hirschberg come down the stairs, showing open hands.
Willi keeps his machine gun trained on them.
Aldo, with his hands up, says:
ALDO
Hey, Willi, what’s with the machine
gun? I thought we had a deal.
WILLI
We do have a deal. Now get the girl
and go.
ALDO
Not so fast, Willi. We only have a
deal, we trust each other. A Mexican standoff ain’t trust.
WILLI
You need guns on me for it to be
a Mexican standoff.
ALDO
You got guns on us, you decide to
shoot, we’re dead. Up top, they got grenades, they drop ’em down here, you’re dead. That’s a Mexican
standoff, and that wasn’t the deal.
WILLI
Just take that fuckin’ traitor and
go! See? Now you’re down here—
Now you get tricky—!
ALDO
—No tricks!—Ain’t nobody gittin’
tricky, Willi! I swear to god, I’m
too damn dumb to get tricky. But
(meaning
Hirschberg)
him and I lived up to the deal. We
came down without guns. Now it’s
your turn. No trust, no deal.
Willi pointing the gun at them . . . thinking . . .
ALDO
I know you’re scared. I’m scared,
he’s scared, we’re all scared.
So what’s it gonna be, Willi?
Either we got a deal or you might
as well just shoot us now.
Willi decides . . .
He puts the machine gun down on the bar.
WILLI
Fine. Take that fucking traitor and
get her out of my sight.
ALDO
Danke, Willi, danke. Okay, Hirschberg, you grab her shoulder—
WHEN...
From behind Aldo and Hirschberg, Bridget lifts up Major Hellstrom’s WALTER and EMPTIES the remaining bullets into
Sgt. Willi, who FALLS to the floor, DEAD.
Aldo and Hirschberg spin around, shocked.
From the floor, the bloody, sweaty, and in excruciating pain (she’ll probably lose that leg} German movie star says to the two American soldiers she’s just meeting for the first time:
BRIDGET
He was an enemy soldier who knew who
I was. He couldn’t live.
INT—FRENCH HOUSE IN COUNTRY (BEDROOM)—NIGHT
An OLD MAN lies asleep under the covers of his blankets, in his bed, in his bedroom . . .
WHEN...
....	OFF SCREEN the	sound of a DOOR BEING KICKED OPEN . . .
....	. The	SOUND of	what sounds like EIGHT	DOGS BARKING . . .
and the	sound	of FEET RUNNING TOWARD US . . .
his bedroom door is THROWN OPEN, and Sgt. Donowitz RUSHES IN, grabbing the old man in his bed and putting a
.45 automatic to his head.
SGT. DONOWITZ
(ENGLISH)
Doctor? Doctor?
OLD MAN
(FRENCH)
What? What’s happening?
Donny SLAMS the .45 hard against the old man’s head, shocking, scaring, and bringing the old gent to attention.
SGT. DONOWITZ
(ENGLISH)
Doctor? Are you a fucking doctor?
He nods his head, yes.
SGT. DONOWITZ
Andiamo . . .
Donny YANKS/DRAGS the old man out of bed, in his almost comical nightshirt (which makes him cuter, thus the brutality against him hurts more) toward the door . . .
INT—DOCTOR’S EXAMINING ROOM—NIGHT
. . . Into a doctor’s examining room built into a French country house, with an examining table and medical instruments.
However, it’s obviously the medical examining room of a veterinarian.
Along the walls are different cages with eight BARKING dogs in them.
The soldiers are putting the shot-in-the-leg, bleeding, and in excruciating pain Bridget on the examining table.
Donny, still holding onto the Old Man, points in the girl’s direction . . .
SGT. DONOWITZ
(ENGLISH)
She’s been shot. Shot. Bang, bang . . .
(pointing at
his leg)
. . . in leg . . . understand?
OLD MAN
(FRENCH)
No, no, no, I don’t speak English.
Donny jams the barrel of his .45 into the thigh of the old man.
SGT. DONOWITZ
(ENGLISH)
BANG, BANG—in the leg, understand!
The old man nods his head, yes.
OLD MAN
(FRENCH)
But I’m a veterinarian . . . animals . . .
I take care of animals . . .
Bridget screams from the table . . .
BRIDGET
(ENGLISH)
He’s a fucking veterinarian, you imbecile!
SGT. DONOWITZ
He’s still a doctor. If he can get
a bullet out of a cow, he can get
a bullet outta you.
LT. ALDO
Right now, we just need morphine.
Donny yells at the old man:
SGT. DONOWITZ
Morphine! We need morphine!
The old man tries to explain in French that he’s not a human doctor . . .
Donny takes the .45 and SHOOTS one of the DOGS in the cages.
Everybody jumps.
Donny SCREAMS at the old man:
SGT. DONOWITZ
MORPHINE!
BANG
He SHOOTS another dog . . .
SGT. DONOWITZ
MORPHINE!
The old man begs him to stop and goes to get the morphine.
CUT TO
The BODY of Gestapo Major DIETER HELLSTROM dead on the floor.
INT—LA LOUISIANE—NIGHT
We’re back in the basement tavern. Col. Hans Landa stands
over the corpse. He moves over to the next corpse, and a smile breaks out on his face.
He says in GERMAN SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:
COL. LANDA
Ahhh, Hugo, you’ve moved up in the world, I see. Lieutenant. And with
your record of insubordination.
Truly remarkable.
A Nazi soldier named HERRMAN joins the S.S. officer.
COL. LANDA
And that one’s . . .
(pointing at
Wicki)
. . . name is Wilhelm Wicki. He’s an Austrian-born Jew who immigrated
to the United States when things
began turning sour for the Israelites. They are the two German-born members of the Basterds. They’ve been known
to don German uniforms to ambush squads.
FLASH ON
three Nazi soldiers walking toward a company of other German soldiers. The three soldiers’ back are to us. Dried, bloody bullet holes cover the backs of the three uniforms.
The SERGEANT of the German company yells to the trio:
SGT. GERMAN COMPANY
What brings you all the way out here?
The TRIO NOW DOWN the GERMAN COMPANY with their machine guns.
BACK TO LANDA
COL. LANDA
But that doesn’t look like this.
This is odd.
Looking down he sees something . . .
Bending down, he examines Fräulein von Hammersmark’s two pretty dress shoes lying on the floor.
One shoe is covered in blood.
The other, while blood-speckled, is fairly clean.
Picking up the clean shoe and holding it in his hand.
COL. LANDA
It would appear somebody’s missing. Somebody fashionable.
AN OFFSCREEN SOLDIER’S VOICE cries out:
SOLDIERS VOICE (OS)
Colonel, this one’s still alive!
We follow Hans to the spot on the floor where Sgt. Willi lies. He’s shot in the chest, but it looks like Max’s daddy is still alive.
INT—EXAMINING ROOM—NIGHT
Bridget on the examining table, post morphine shot.
The other Basterds in the room watch Aldo interrogate the German lady.
LT. ALDO
Now ’fore we yank that slug outta ya, you need to answer a few questions.
BRIDGET
Few questions about what?
LT. ALDO
About I got three men dead back there, and why don’t you try tellin’ us what the fuck happened?
BRIDGET
The British officer blew his German
act, and a Gestapo major saw it.
LT. ALDO
’Fore we get into who shot John,
Why did you invite my men to a
rendezvous in a basement with a bunch
of Nazis?
BRIDGET
I can see, since you didn’t see
what happened inside, the Nazis
being there must look odd.
LT. ALDO
Yeah, we gotta word for that kinda
odd in English. It’s called
suspicious.
BRIDGET
Don’t let your imagination get the better of you, Lieutenant. You met
the sergeant, Willi. He had a baby tonight. His commanding officer gave
him and his friends the night off to celebrate.
The Germans being there
was just a tragic coincidence.
