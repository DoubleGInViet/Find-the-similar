Aldo thinks for a moment . . .
LT. ALDO
Okay, I’ll buy that. He was either
there with his men waiting for us,
or he was there celebrating his
son’s birthday. He wasn’t doin’ both.
LT. ALDO
How did the shootin’ start?
BRIDGET
The English man gave himself away.
LT. ALDO
How did he do that?
BRIDGET
He ordered three glasses.
She holds up three fingers, middle to pinky.
BRIDGET
He ordered three glasses.
She holds up three fingers, thumb to middle.
BRIDGET
This is the German three. The other
is odd. Germans would and did notice it.
LT. ALDO
Okay, let’s pretend there were no Germans, and everything went exactly
the way it was supposed to. What would of been the next step?
BRIDGET
Tuxedoes. To get them into the
premiere wearing military uniforms,
with all the military there, would
have been suicide. But going as
members of the German film industry,
they wear tuxedoes and blend in with everybody else. I arranged a tailor
to fit three tuxedoes tonight.
LT. ALDO
How did you intend to get them into
the premiere?
BRIDGET
Hand me my purse.
They do. And she opens it and takes out three tickets to the film premiere.
BRIDGET
Lt. Hicox was going as my escort.
The other two were going as a German cameraman and his assistant.
LT. ALDO
Can you still get us into that
premiere?
BRIDGET
Can you speak German better than your friends?
No. Have I been shot? Yes.
I don’t see me tripping the light fantastic up the red carpet anytime
soon. Least of all by tomorrow
night.
(pause)
However, there’s something you don’t know. There’s been two recent developments regarding Operation
Kino. One, the venue has been
changed from The Ritz to a much
smaller venue.
LT. ALDO
Enormous changes at the last minute? That’s not very Germanic. Why the
hell is Goebbels doin’ stuff so damn peculiar?
BRIDGET
It probably has something to do with
the second development.
LT. ALDO
Which is?
FLASH ON
IN A PRIVATE DINING ROOM IN GERMANY, the FUHRER, aka Adolf Hitler, aka Adolf Shicklegroover, aka the Bohemian Corporal, having dinner with Goebbels, only a few short days ago.
THE FUHRER
(GERMAN)
I’ve been rethinking my position in regards to your Paris premiere of “Nation’s Pride.” As the weeks have
gone on and the Americans are on
the beach, I do find myself thinking
more and more about this Private
Zoller. This boy has done something tremendous for us. And I’m beginning
to think my participation in this
event could be meaningful.
BACK TO BRIDGET
BRIDGET
The Führer’s attending the premiere.
Donny breaks the team’s silence:
SGT. DONOWITZ
What?
LT. ALDO
When the hell did this happen?
BRIDGET
The venue change, two weeks ago.
The Führer’s attendance, four days
ago.
LT. ALDO
And how come London don’t know
nothing about that?
BRIDGET
We need to get something straight,
once and for all. Everything London knows, it learned from me. If I
don’t know, London doesn’t know.
So now, this is me, informing you, Hitler’s coming to Paris.
SGT. DONOWITZ
FUCK A DUCK!
Aldo stands up from the chair, pacing as he takes in this new information.
BRIDGET
What are you thinking?
LT. ALDO
I’m thinking getting a wack at
plantin’ ole Uncle Adolph makes
this a horse of a different color.
BRIDGET
What’s that supposed to mean?
LT. ALDO
It means you’re gettin’ us into that premiere.
BRIDGET
I’m going to probably end up losing
this leg, bye bye, acting career,
fun while it lasted. How do you
expect me to walk up a red carpet?
LT. ALDO
The doggie	doc’s gonna dig that slug outta your
gam. Then he’s gonna	wrap
it up	in a	cast, and	you gotta good
“how I broke my leg	mountain climbing” story.
That’s German, ain’t	it?
Y’all	like	climbin’	mountains,
don’t	cha?
BRIDGET
I don’t. I like smoking, drinking,
and ordering in restaurants, but I
see your point.
LT. ALDO
We fill ya up with morphine, till
it’s comin out ya ears. Then just
limp your little ass up that
rouge car-pet.
BRIDGET
Splendid. When the Nazis put me up against a wall, it won’t hurt
so much.
(changing tone)
I know this is a silly question
before I ask it, but can you
Americans speak any other language
than English?
HIRSCHBERG
Other than Yiddish?
BRIDGET
Preferably.
Donny, referring to Aldo and himself:
SGT. DONOWITZ
We both speak a little Italian.
BRIDGET
With an atrocious accent, no doubt.
But that doesn’t exactly kill us
in the crib. Germans don’t have a
good ear for Italian. So you mumble Italian and brazen through it, is
that the plan?
LT. ALDO
That’s about it.
BRIDGET
That sounds good.
LT. ALDO
It sounds like shit, but what else
we gonna do, go home?
BRIDGET
No, it’s good. If you don’t blow it
with that, I can get you in the building.
(changes tone)
So, who does what?
LT. ALDO
Well, I speak the most Italian, so
I’ll be your escort. Donowitz speaks
the second most, so he’ll be your Italian cameraman. And Hirschberg
third most, so he’ll be Donny’s assistant.
HIRSCHBERG
I don’t speak Italian.
LT. ALDO
Like I said, third best. Just keep
your fuckin’ mouth shut. In fact, why don’t you start practicing right now.
BRIDGET
(meaning Utivich)
What about the little one?
UTIVICH
Do you mean me?
BRIDGET
I didn’t mean any offense.
UTIVICH
None taken, you German cunt.
LT. ALDO
Utivich is the chauffeur.
UTIVICH
I can’t drive.
Bridget SCREAMS in frustration:
BRIDGET
You Americans are fucking useless!
UTIVICH
Gimmie a break. I’m from Manhattan.
LT. ALDO
No worries, son. We got over fourteen hours before the movie tomorrow.
More than enough time for you to learn to drive.
UTIVICH
No, no, no, no, Lieutenant, it’s not!
LT. ALDO
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, Private, it is. And yes, yes, yes, you will.
(changes tone)
Look, Utivich, you and I both know,
if we went to grade school together,
you damn sure ain’t copyin’ off of my test. Well, I lernt to drive in four hours on a Tennessee mountain road.
And I’m a shit-for-brains coal miner
bootlegger. Hirschberg, you know how
to drive, right?
HIRSCHBERG
Yes.
LT. ALDO
Teach ’im.
BRIDGET
But there is a problem. I’m a movie star. This is a movie premiere.
I can’t show up looking like I was
just in a Nazi gunfight. Now I
have a dress for the premiere at my hotel. But sometime tomorrow I
have to get my hair done.
All the Basterds, except Donny, burst out laughing.
LT. ALDO
Sister, you must got wunderbar luck. Guess who went to beauty school?
The CAMERA WHIP-PANS to SGT. DONOWITZ.
Bridget rolls her eyes.
BLACK FRAME
CHAPTER TITLE APPEARS:
CHAPTER FIVE
“REVENGE OF THE GIANT FACE”
FADE OFF
INT—SHOSANNA AND MARCEL’S LIVING QUARTERS—NIGHT
We’re in Shosanna and Marcel’s living quarters above the cinema. We’ve never been in here before.
A SUBTITLE APPEARS ONSCREEN:
“NIGHT OF ‘NATION’S PRIDE’ PREMIERE”
Shosanna’s standing before a full-length mirror in a real attractive forties-style dress for the premiere. She’s stunning. This is the first time in her life she’s had the opportunity
or the occasion to wear something like this. Since she knows this is the last night of her life, no time like the present.
SOUNDS of the hubbub of the premiere, not to mention the
German brass band that’s blaring Third Reich marches, can be heard coming from below.
Shosanna walks to her apartment window and looks down at the Germanic miasma below.
SHOSANNA’S POV
WE SEE all the pageantry below. Tons of SPECTATORS. Tons of guests dressed in Nazi uniforms, tuxedoes, and female finery, walking up the long red carpet (with a big swastika in the middle, naturally) leading into Shosanna’s cinema. The German brass band omm-pa-pa-ing away. German radio and film crews covering the event for the fatherland back home. And, of course, MANY GERMAN SOLDIERS providing security for this joyous Germanic occasion.
Shosanna COUGHS up a lugi and HOCKS it.
A GERMAN S.S. GENERAL being interviewed by a RADIO COMMENTATOR—the lugi HITS him right on his bald head.
Shosanna goes back to the full-length mirror, places a very fashionable forties-style hat on her head, then lowers the period-style black fishnet veil over her face. She takes out
a small GUN and puts it in the pocket of her dress, and it’s on. She exits the apartment door to join the premiere.
From this point on, there’s no turning back. It’s all the way baby, all the fucking way!
INT—CINEMA STAIRWELL—NIGHT
The stairwell in the building that connects the living
quarters with the cinema. Shosanna walks down the stairs and goes through a door that puts her next to the projection booth door. She takes out a key and opens it.
INT—PROJECTION BOOTH—NIGHT
Marcel’s prepping the film reels for tonight. The five silver metal film cans that carry one 35mm reel of film each are laid out. The cans for reels one and two are empty. Cans for reel three, our specially marked can for reel four, and the can for reel five (which should never see the light of a projector) lie in wait.
Shosanna, looking like a forties movie star, enters the projection booth.
The scene in FRENCH SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:
MARCEL
Ooh la la, Danielle Darrieux, this
is so exciting. Pleased to meet you.
SHOSANNA
Shut up, fool.
Marcel lifts up the veil covering her face and their lips meet.
SHOSANNA
Cheeky black bugger. I have to go
down and socialize with these Hun
pigs. Let’s go over it again?
MARCEL
Reel one is on the first projector.
Reel two is on the second. Three
and four are ready to go.
SHOSANNA
Okay, the big sniper battle in the
film begins around the middle of
the third reel. Our film comes on
in the fourth reel, so somewhere
toward the end of the third reel,
go down and lock the doors of the auditorium.
Then take your place
behind the screen, and wait for my
CUE when I give it to you: BURN IT DOWN!
INT—CINEMA LOBBY—NIGHT
The pageantry of the evening is in full swing, as all the German beautiful people enter the cinema. They mingle in the swastika-covered, Greek-nude-statue-peppered lobby. Nazi military commanders, high-ranking party officials, and German celebrities (Emil Jannings, Veit Harlan) hobnob and drink Champagne from passing WAITERS, who carry glasses on silver trays.
We see Shosanna enter from the area at the top of the big staircase in the lobby that overlooks the lobby parlor entrance. She descends the staircase and busies herself with theater stuff.
At the top of the staircase, looking down at the master race in all their finery, is Col. Hans Landa, dressed in his finest S.S. dress uniform.
CAMERA FRAME
directly behind him. On the right side, we see the figure of
Col. Landa, from behind, watching the guests entering the
cinema. On the left side of the frame is the cinema entrance, from
a	looking-down perspective of the guests entering the building. THEN... 
A THINK BUBBLE, like in a comic book, appears on the left
side of the frame, obscuring the cinema entrance. Inside Landa’s think bubble a little scene plays out.
THINK BUBBLE
A hospital room filled with DOCTORS, NURSES, and a
PATIENT in a hospital bed. Then Col. Landa enters the room and screams at everybody:
COL. LANDA
I want everybody out of this room!
They start to leave.
COL. LANDA
That means now, goddamnit!
They RUSH OUT.
He walks over to the patient in the hospital bed. It’s none other than SGT. WILLI, and yes, he’s still alive.
Landa pulls up a chair next to the bed and sits down.
COL. LANDA
Can you speak, Sergeant?
SGT. WILLI
(weakly)
Yes, Colonel.
COL. LANDA
Tell me everything that happened in there.
The THINK BUBBLE DISSOLVES away, revealing the entrance again, and as if on perfect cue, in walks Bridget von Hammersmark, dressed lovely, leg in a big white cast. The three Basterds in their tuxedos flank her.
CU COL. LANDA
smiles.
He descends the stairs, toward the four saboteurs . . .
They speak in GERMAN, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:
COL. LANDA
Fräulein von Hammersmark, what
has befallen Germany’s most elegant swan?
BRIDGET
Col. Landa, it’s been years.
Dashing as ever, I see.
COL. LANDA
Flattery will get you everywhere, Fräulein.
They chuckle and air kiss.
COL. LANDA
So what’s happened to your lovely
leg? A by-product of kicking ass in
the German cinema, no doubt.
BRIDGET
Save your flattery, you old dog.
I know too many of your former
conquests to fall into that honeypot.
Chuckle . . . chuckle . . .
COL. LANDA
Seriously, what happened?
BRIDGET
Well, I tried my hand, foolishly I
might add, at mountain climbing.
And this was the result.
COL. LANDA
Mountain climbing? That’s how you injured your leg—mountain climbing?
BRIDGET
Believe it or not, yes, it is.
A brief moment passes between the two . . .
THEN... 
The colonel BURSTS OUT with UPROARIOUS LAUGHTER. So uproarious, in fact, that it’s quite disconcerting to the four saboteurs.
The colonel begins to regain his composure . . .
COL. LANDA
Forgive me, Fräulein. I don’t mean to laugh at your misfortune. It’s just
. . . mountain climbing? I’m curious, Fräulein, what could have ever
compelled you to undertake such a foolhardy endeavor?
The double meaning is not lost on the German actress.
BRIDGET
Well, I shan’t be doing it again, I can tell you that.
COL. LANDA
That cast looks as fresh as my old
Uncle Gustave. When were you climbing this mountain, last night?
BRIDGET
Very good eye, Colonel. It happened yesterday morning.
COL. LANDA
Hummm. And where exactly in Paris
is this mountain?
This stops her for a second.
Then Landa laughs it off, taking them off the hook.
COL. LANDA
I’m just teasing you, Fräulein. You
know me, I tease rough. So who are
your three handsome escorts?
BRIDGET
I’m afraid neither of the three speak a word of German. They’re friends of
mine from Italy. This is a wonderful Italian stuntman, Antonio Margheriti.
(meaning Aldo)
A very talented cameraman, Enzo Gorlomi.
(meaning Donny)
And Enzo’s camera assistant, Dominick Decocco.
The German Fräulein turns to the three tuxedo-wearing Basterds.
BRIDGET
(ITALIAN)
Gentlemen, this is an old friend, Colonel Hans Landa of the S.S.
The Basterds know only too well who Landa the Jew Hunter is, but they can’t show it.
Aldo sticks out his hand . . .
LT. ALDO
Buongiorno.
The German takes his hand . . .
COL. LANDA
Margheriti . . .
(ITALIAN)
Am I saying it correctly? . . . Margheriti?
LT. ALDO
(ITALIAN)
Yes. Correct.
COL. LANDA
(ITALIAN)
Margheriti . . . Say it for me once, please . .
. ?
LT. ALDO
Margheriti.
COL. LANDA
(ITALIAN)
I’m sorry, again . . . ?
LT. ALDO
Margheriti.
COL. LANDA
(ITALIAN)
Once more . . .?
LT. ALDO
Margheriti.
COL. LANDA
Margheriti.
(FRENCH)
It means daisies, I believe.
Turning his gaze to Donny.
COL. LANDA
(ITALIAN)
What’s your name again?
SGT. DONOWITZ
Enzo Gorlomi.
COL. LANDA
(ITALIAN)
Again . . . ?
SGT. DONOWITZ
Gorlomi.
COL. LANDA
(ITALIAN)
One more time, but let me really
hear the music in it.
SGT. DONOWITZ
(HAMMY ITALIAN)
Gorlomi.
Now to Hirschberg . . .
COL. LANDA
(ITALIAN)
And you?
Then Hirschberg breaks out the best Italian accent of the group:
HIRSCHBERG
Dominick Decocco.
COL. LANDA
Dominick Decocco?
HIRSCHBERG
Dominic Decocco.
COL. LANDA
Bravo . . . Bravo.
BRIDGET
(GERMAN)
Well, my two cameraman friends need
to find their seats.
Col. Landa stops a WAITER with a tray of champagne glasses.
COL. LANDA
(GERMAN)
Not so fast. Let’s enjoy some champagne.
Everyone gets a glass.
COL. LANDA
(FRENCH)
—Oh, Mademoiselle Mimieux, please
join us. I have some friends I’d
like you to meet.
Shosanna joins the circle and is handed a champagne glass.
This is the first moment the Basterds are aware of Shosanna.
COL. LANDA
(FRENCH)
May I say, Mademoiselle, you look divine.
SHOSANNA
(FRENCH)
Merci.
COL. LANDA
(GERMAN)
This lovely young lady is Mademoiselle Emmanuelle Mimieux. This is her cinema, and she is our hostess for the evening.
(FRENCH)
And, Mademoiselle, this battered, broken, and none-worse-for-the-wear German goddess, is Bridget von Hammersmark.
BRIDGET
Bonjour.
SHOSANNA
Bonjour.
BRIDGET
(FRENCH)
I’m afraid my companions don’t speak
any French. They’re Italian. This is Antonio, Enzo, and Dominick.
All three smile goofy, spaghetti-bender smiles.
COL. LANDA
(FRENCH)
Actually, Fräulein von Hammersmark’s Italian associates need help finding their seats. Perhaps Mademoiselle Mimieux would be so kind as to escort them?
SHOSANNA
(FRENCH)
It would be my pleasure. Let me see
your tickets?
Donny hands her two tickets. She indicates for them to follow her.
Donny and Hirschberg both exchange one last look with Aldo, then follow the young French girl into the auditorium.
INT—AUDITORIUM—NIGHT
The cinema auditorium is filling up quickly with gray and black uniforms.
Shosanna finds the two counterfeit Italians their seats.
After she points out their seats, she turns to leave . . .
Hirschberg . . .
reaches out and grabs her wrist. . . .
He looks her in the face and, filled with tremendous guilt, because if he’s successful tonight he’s going to blow this
cute French girl to smithereens, he says:
HIRSCHBERG
Grazie.
The cute French girl looks back at the goofy-looking Italian boy with slicked-back hair that makes him look kind of
Jewish with tremendous guilt, knowing if she is successful tonight, she’s going to burn him alive, and says:
SHOSANNA
Prego.
BACK TO THE LOBBY
They begin flicking the lights on and off. A GERMAN SOLDIER YELLS IN GERMAN:
GERMAN SOLDIER
Take your seats! The show is about to begin!
Everybody take your seats!
Col. Landa, Lt. Aldo, and Bridget are still together.
COL. LANDA
(GERMAN)
I must call the Führer. He doesn’t
want to make his entrance until everybody is seated. Come with me, Frau von Hammersmark. The Führer has
heard you’re here, and he wishes to commend you personally.
BRIDGET
(GERMAN)
Me? Why?
COL. LANDA
(GERMAN)
Don’t be modest. Everybody is quite taken with your resolve. An accident like you’ve just experienced, and
yet you still show up to an
important party event. The Führer
was quite adamant in his gratitude. We’ll use Mademoiselle Mimieux’s office.
(to Aldo
in Italian)
I’m afraid I must rob you of your companion, but only for a moment.
BRIDGET
(ITALIAN)
Yes, apparently the Führer wishes to commend me.
COL. LANDA
(ITALIAN)
Wait here a moment. I promise I won’t detain her long.
What are either of them supposed to do, argue?
Col. Landa goes over to one of the Nazi GUARDS/USHERS and whispers in his ear, guesturing toward Aldo. Like he’s saying, leave the boy alone, till we come back . . . Or is he?
Col. Landa limps Bridget away toward Shosanna’s office.
As Aldo stands in the lobby, more and more people enter the auditorium, till it’s only Aldo and the six Nazi guards/ushers in the now-vacant lobby.
INT—SHOSANNA’S OFFICE—NIGHT
Shosanna’s cinema manager’s office. It’s small, cluttered, and dominated by a desk.
They both enter.
Col. Landa closes the door behind him and LOCKS IT.
Bridget notices but says nothing.
Now the two Germans are alone.
COL. LANDA
Have a seat, Fräulein.
Pointing at one lone chair in front of the desk.
She lowers herself in the chair.
Instead of moving around to the other side of the desk,
opposite her, the S.S. Colonel pulls another little chair over and places it in front of the fräulein.
He sits, their knees almost touching.
The colonel points to the foot not in the cast.
COL. LANDA
(GERMAN)
Let me see your foot.
BRIDGET
(GERMAN)
I beg your pardon?
Patting his lap.
COL. LANDA
Put your foot in my lap.
BRIDGET
Colonel, you embarrass me.
COL. LANDA
I assure you, Fräulein, my intention
is not to flirt.
Patting his lap more with more aggression.
The nervous fräulein lifts up her strappy dress shoe enclosed foot and places it in the colonel’s lap.
The Colonel very delicately unfastens the thin straps that hold the fräulein’s shoe on her foot . . .
. . . . He removes the shoe . . .
. . . . Leaving only the fräulein’s bare foot . . .
THEN... 
He removes from his heavy S.S. coat pocket the pretty dress shoe the fräulein left behind at La Louisiane . . .
He slips it on her foot . . .
. . . . It fits like a glove.
Bridget knows she’s BUSTED.
Col. Landa smiles and says in ENGLISH:
COL. LANDA
What’s that American expression . . .
“If the shoe fits . . . you must wear it.”
He removes her foot from his lap.
BRIDGET
(GERMAN)
What now, Colonel?
COL. LANDA
(GERMAN)
Do you admit your treachery?
She stares defiant daggers into him.
BRIDGET
(GERMAN)
The only think I will admit to is resisting you
. . .
(ENGLISH)
Sons-a-bitches . . .
(GERMAN)
. . . to my last breath.
COL. LANDA
“Resist to your last breath”?
SUDDENLY . . .
Hans LUNGES forward, putting his strong mitts around Bridget von Hammersmark’s lily-white, delicate neck, and with all the violence of a lion in mid-pounce, SQUEEZES with all his MIGHT.
Bridget’s face turns tomato RED, as the VEINS in her face BULGE and her esophagus is CRUSHED in his GRIP.
With a violent YANK, he JERKS her TO THE FLOOR. She TUMBLES
out of the chair, Landa never releasing his GRIP around her throat. Now fully on top of her, he BEARS DOWN, SQUEEZING THE VERY LIFE OUT OF HER. Everything he has, he brings to bear on the elegant lady’s neck.
Then, to finally finish her off, he begins BANGING THE BACK OF HER HEAD, HARD AGAINST THE FLOOR . . .
BANG!
BANG!
BANG!
She’s dead.
He releases the grip around her throat. His hands are TREMBLING . . .
He rises.
Strangling the very life out of somebody with your bare hands is the most violent act a human being can commit.
Also, only humans strangle, opposable thumbs being a quite important part of the endeavor. As Hans Landa stands, the sheer violence he had to call on to accomplish this task
still surges through him. He tries to gain control of the trembling that is rippling through his body. He takes out a silver S.S. FLASK (filled with peach schnapps) and knocks back
a couple of swigs. He holds his hand out in front of him. The TREMBLING is beginning to subside. He picks up the telephone.
Into the phone, in German, he says:
COL. LANDA
Inform the Führer the audience has
taken their seats, and we’re ready
to begin.
Step one in Hans’s master plan, done.
He then dials another number . . .
INT—LOBBY—NIGHT
Aldo in the lobby . . .
WHEN... 
. . . . He’s JUMPED by the SIX NAZI USHERS . . .
He’s THROWN	ROUGHLY	to the	ground face	first.	Like the modern-
day	Secret Service,	within	seconds his	wrists	are handcuffed behind
his	back and he’s	searched. They	find the BOMB attached to his
ankle. It’s	removed, and	a	BLACK	CLOTH	BAG	is	pulled over his head.
Then he’s hoisted	up and	RUSHED out of	the	building.
This happens in mere seconds, and quietly too. No one in the auditorium is none the wiser . . .
INT—AUDITORIUM—NIGHT
. . . including Donowitz and Hirschberg, sitting among the master race, waiting for showtime.
EXT—CINEMA—NIGHT
The six Nazi soldiers hustle the hooded Aldo down the red carpet, then into the alley beside the cinema.
Aldo’s put up against a wall.
Inside the black hood, he’s SCREAMING every insulting thing about Germany, Germans, German food, German shepherd . . . anything.
COL. LANDA’S VOICE (OS)
Shut up!
The faceless black hood does.
Col. Landa, now standing directly in front of his hooded prisoner, says in ENGLISH:
COL. LANDA
As Stanley said to Livingstone: Lieutenant Aldo
Raine, I presume?
LT. ALDO
Hans Landa?
COL. LANDA
You’ve had a nice long run, Aldo.
Alas, you’re now in the hands of the S.S. My hands to be exact. And they’ve been waiting a long time to touch you.
He reaches out with his finger and lightly touches Aldo’s face right in the middle of the hood.
Aldo’s head VIOLENTLY FLINCHES.
COL. LANDA
Caught ya flinching.
In German, he orders the men to put Aldo in the back of a truck.
Aldo, bound and bagged, is put in the truck. Also in the truck is Utivich, wearing a makeshift chauffeur’s uniform, bound and bagged like the lieutenant.
The truck drives off.
Col. Landa turns around and SEES FROM A DISTANCE Hitler’s motorcade pull up to the cinema. Then the Führer, Goebbels, Francesca, and the rest of the entourage make their way down
the red carpet into the cinema.
Landa smiles.
EXT TRUCK (MOVING)—NIGHT
We see the truck leaving the city of Paris, under the veil of night.
We also seem to be leaving the drama of Operation Kino.
INT—TRUCK (MOVING)—NIGHT
The two hooded prisoners bounce along in the back of the truck.
Utivich is crying inside his hood.
LT. ALDO
Utivich?
UTIVICH
Is that you, Lieutenant?
LT. ALDO
Yep.
UTIVICH
Do you know what happened to Donny? Hirschberg?
The woman?
UTIVICH
Do you know what happened to Donny? Hirschberg?
The woman?
LT. ALDO
No, I do not.
UTIVICH
Lieutenant, sorry I’m crying.
LT. ALDO
Nothin’ to be sorry about, son.
This bag get to anyone.
UTIVICH
Not exactly John Wayne, am I?
LT. ALDO
John Wayne’s a pampered movie star.
He bursts into tears if his cook
busts his yoke at breakfast. Just
try puttin’ a bag over his head and
hear what kinda sounds he makes.
Utivich giggles through the tears.
LT. ALDO
I just want you to know, son, I was
real proud of you tonight. Learnin’
how to drive overnight. Driving in
that limo line. You was in the hot
seat, son, and you stood up real good.
Utivich cries LOUDER.
Aldo takes his foot, finds Utivich’s foot, and places his foot on top.
The TOUCH has a slightly calming effect on Utivich.
In the darkness, Utivich has reclaimed his dignity.
EXT—COUNTRY TAVERN—NIGHT
The truck pulls up to a small tavern outside of Paris (not La Louisaiane).
The two hooded prisoners are walked inside the establishment.
INT—COUNTRY TAVERN—NIGHT
The hooded men are led into the closed for business, but open for something else rustic tavern.
The Nazi guards unlock the handcuffs, then sit them down in chairs.
Then, simultaneously, the hoods are YANKED OFF.
The two prisoners are seated at a table, in what they can now see is a rustic tavern. On the table is one telephone, one bottle of Chianti, and three glasses. And on the opposite end of the table sits Col. Hans Landa.
A	NAZI SOLDIER sits posted at an impressive-looking two-way radio set up in the tavern.
Col. Landa starts in right away at the two baffled, discombobulated American soldiers.
They will only speak ENGLISH in the scene.
COL. LANDA
Italian? Really?
(BEAT)
What could you have possibly been thinking?
LT. ALDO
Well, I speak a little Italian—
COL. LANDA
I speak a little Tagalog, but I
wouldn’t begin to presume I could
pass for Filipino. Don’t get me
wrong, I understand you were in a pickle, what with you losing your Germans. And I have nothing but admiration for improvisation. Still . . . Chico Marx is more convincing. If the three of you had
shown up at the premiere dressed
in woman’s attire, it would have been
more convincing.
Landa’s eyes go to the two Nazi guards behind the prisoners.
COL. LANDA
(GERMAN)
You may leave us. But stay alert outside.
They exit, leaving the colonel, the lieutenant, the private, and a German radio man in the corner.
COL. LANDA
So you’re Aldo the Apache?
LT. ALDO
So you’re the Jew Hunter?
COL. LANDA
Jew Hunter (pfuit). I’m a detective.
A damn good detective. Finding
people is my specialty. So naturally
I worked for the Nazis finding people.
And yes, some of them were Jews.
But Jew Hunter? Just the name that stuck.
UTIVICH
Well, you do hafta admit, it is
catchy.
COL. LANDA
Do you control the nicknames your enemies bestow on you? Aldo the Apache and the Little Man?
UTIVICH
What do you mean, the Little Man?
COL. LANDA
The German’s nickname for you.
UTIVICH
The German’s nickname for me is the Little Man?
COL. LANDA
Or the “Little One”, either one means you.
And as if to make my point, I’m a
little surprised how tall you
are in real life. I mean, you’re a
little fellow. But not circus-midget
little, as your reputation would
suggest.
LT. ALDO
Where are my men? Where is Bridget
von Hammersmark?
COL. LANDA
Bridget von Hammersmark. Oh, I’m sure she’s in whatever, big bubbling
cesspool in hell the devil reserves
for traitors of her ilk.
COL. LANDA
(CON’T)
Well, let’s just say she got what
she deserved. And when you purchase
friends like Bridget von Hammersmark,
you get what you pay for.
Now as far as your paisanos
Sergeant Donowitz and Private Hirschberg—
LT. ALDO
How do you know our names?
COL. LANDA
Lt. Aldo, if you don’t think I wouldn’t
interrogate every single one of your
swastika-marked survivors . . . ?
We simply aren’t operating on the
level of mutual respect I assumed.
Now, back to the whereabouts of your
two Italian saboteurs. At this
moment, both Hirschberg
and Donowitz should be sitting in the
very seats we left them in. Seats
0023 and 0024, if my memory serves.
Explosives, still around their ankles,
still ready to explode.
And your mission, some
would call it a terrorist plot, as of
this moment is still a go.
The two basterds don’t believe this. It can’t be true.
LT. ALDO
That’s a pretty exciting story.
What’s next, Eliza on the ice?
COL. LANDA
However, all I have to do is
pick up that phone right there,
inform the cinema, and your plans
kaput.
LT. ALDO
IF they’re still there, and IF they’re still alive, and that’s one big IF, there ain’t no way you gonna take
them boys without settin’ off them bombs.
COL. LANDA
I have no doubt, and yes, some
Germans will die, and yes, it will
ruin the evening, and yes, Goebbels
will be very very very mad at you
for what you’ve done to his big night. But you won’t get Hitler, you won’t
get Goebbels, you won’t get Goering,
and you won’t get Boormann. And you
need all four to end the war.
(pause)
But if I don’t pick up that phone
right there, you may very well get
all four. And if you get all four,
you end the war . . . tonight.
The Nazi colonel lifts up the bottle of Chianti and fills three glasses. As he pours, he says:
COL. LANDA
So, gentlemen, let’s discuss the prospect of ending the war . . . tonight.
All three have their Chianti filled glasses.
COL. LANDA
So the way I see it, since Hitler’s death, or possible rescue, rests
solely on my reaction . . . If I do nothing . .
. It’s as if I’m causing his death, even more than yourselves.
Would you agree?
LT. ALDO
I guess so.
COL. LANDA
How about you, Utivich?
UTIVICH
I guess so too.
COL. LANDA
Good, we more or less all agree. Gentlemen, I have no intention of killing Hitler, and killing Goebbels, and killing Goering, and killing Boormann, not to mention winning the war single-handedly for the Allies,
only later to find myself standing
before a Jewish tribunal.
Now they get it.
COL. LANDA
If you want to win the war, tonight,
we have to make a deal.
LT. ALDO
What kinda deal?
COL. LANDA
The kind you wouldn’t have the
authority to make. However, I’m sure this mission of yours has a
commanding officer? A general, I’m betting. For . . .
(thinking)
. . . . O.S.S. would be my guess.
Aldo’s eyebrows reveal that was a good guess.
COL. LANDA
Oooh, that’s a bingo. Is that the
way you say it, that’s a bingo?
LT. ALDO
You just say, bingo.
COL. LANDA
Bingo! How fun. But I digress, where
were we? Oh, yes, make a deal. Over there is a very capable two-way
radio. And sitting behind it is a
more than capable radio operator
named Herrman. Get me somebody on
the other end of that radio with the power of the pen to authorize my—
let’s call it, the terms of my conditional surrender, if that tastes better going down.
BACK TO THE PREMIER
Shosanna is in the booth. She brings down the lights.
In the packed, excited auditorium, the house lights go down.
CU CURTAIN SWITCH. She flips it.
In the auditorium, the RED VELVET CURTAINS part.
Shosanna throws the lever on the first projector.
The PROJECTOR BULB goes HOT WHITE, PROJECTING A BEAM . . .
FILM REELS rotate . . .
35mm FILM moves through the projector’s film gate . . .
The opening seal of a film by the THIRD REICH flickers on the SCREEN . . .
Goebbels and Francesca watch . . .
Hitler watches . . .
Fredrick watches . . .
Donowitz and Hirschberg watch . . .
Shosanna, in the booth, watches through the little window . . .
The CAMERA PANS OFF of Shosanna to the clearly marked film can, REEL 4. The SURPRISE REEL.
BACK TO LANDA AND THE BASTERDS
Landa, with radio headphones over his ears and a microphone
in his hand, talks to the UNSEEN/UNHEARD American brass on the other end.
COL. LANDA
. . . So, when the military history of this night is written, it will be recorded that I was part of
Operation Kino from the very
beginning, as a double agent.
Anything I’ve done in my guise as an S.S. colonel was sanctioned by the O.S.S., as a necessary evil to
establish my cover with the Germans.
And it was my placement of
Lieutenant Raine’s dynamite in Hitler and
Goebbels’s opera box that assured their demise.
By the way, that last
part is actually true.
FLASH ON
Landa placing bomb in Hitler and Goebbels’s opera box.
BACK TO LANDA
COL. LANDA
I want my full military pension and benefits under my proper rank.
I want to receive the Congressional
Medal of Honor for my invaluable
assistance in the toppling of the Third
Reich.
He looks over and sees Aldo and Utivich watching the one-sided conversation.
COL. LANDA
In fact, I want all the members of “Operation Kino” to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor. Full citizenship for myself—but that goes without saying. And I would
like the United States of America to purchase property for me on
Nantucket island, as a reward for
all the countless lives I’ve saved
by bringing the tyranny of the
National Socialist Party to a
swifter than imagined end. Do you
have all that, sir?
(pause)
I look forward to seeing you face to face as well, sir.
(pause)
He’s right here.
The colonel hands the headphones and microphone to Aldo.
LT. ALDO
Yes, sir?
We HEAR the VOICE on the other end of the radio give Aldo his orders:
RADIO VOICE (OS)
Colonel Landa will put you and
Private Utivich in a truck as
prisoners. Then he and his radio operator will get in the truck,
drive to our lines. Upon crossing
our lines, Colonel Landa and his
man will surrender to you. You will
then take over driving of the truck and bring them straight to me for
debriefing. Is that clear, Lieutenant?
LT. ALDO
Yes, sir.
The conversation is over. He puts the radio down.
The three men look at one another.
Landa picks up his wine.
COL. LANDA
So I suppose the only thing left to
do is lift a glass and toast to
Donowitz and Hirschberg’s success.
You too, Herrman, come over here.
The four men, Col. Hans Landa, Lt. Aldo Raine, Pfc. Smithson Utivich, and Herrman, lift up four glasses of wine.
COL. LANDA
Gentlemen, to history, and its witnesses.
CHEERS.
BACK TO THE PREMIERE
WE CUT TO THE B/W FILM ON SCREEN.
Fredrick Zoller, playing himself, is in an ornamental tower in a Russian village, picking off RUSSIAN SOLDIERS below.
A RUSSIAN GENERAL KCHOVLANSKEY
peering at the German private through binoculars. He lowers the long-range glasses and confers with one of his OFFICERS.
GEN. KCHOVLANSKEY
(RUSSIAN)
What’s the death toll?
OFFICER
(RUSSIAN)
47, so far.
WE HEAR A SHOT.
OFFICER
(RUSSIAN)
48.	General, I implore you, we must destroy that tower!
GEN. KCHOVLANSKEY
(RUSSIAN)
That tower is one of the oldest and
most beautiful structures in Russia.
I won’t be responsible for turning a thousand years of history into dust!
A BRAVE RUSSIAN SOLDIER tries to run between two buildings.
Zoller gets him.
Then proceeds to pick him apart, one bullet at a time.
SHOSANNA IN THE PROJECTION BOOTH
She removes “REEL 4” (the Special Shosanna Reel) and prepares
it on the second projector. Reel 3, on the first projector, playing now, is halfway through. In a few short minutes, it’s going to be show time.
Marcel says to Shosanna in FRENCH, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:
MARCEL
It’s time. I should go lock the auditorium and take my place behind the screen.
This is the last time they will ever see each other—too much to say. He holds her in his arms and lays a one kiss before I die wet one on her.
DONOWITZ AND HIRSCHBERG
sit in their seats watching the movie, surrounded by DRESS-UNIFORM NAZIS. They’ve developed a dopey way of communicating with each other in this hostile environment.
Basically, speaking English as if it were gibberish Italian they say English words, only adding an “I” or “A” or “O” to the end of it. And saying it in an exaggerated Italian accent, complete with pantomimes.
Donowitz leans into Hirschberg and says in a whisper:
They speak in ITALIAN-ISH SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:
SGT. DONOWITZ
(ITALIAN-ISH)
I-a go-a toilet-a, set-ta Boom-a.
(I go to the toilet and set the bomb.)
When-a I-a go-a, you-a set-ta Boom-a.
(When I go, you set your bomb.)
Hirschberg indicates/pantomimes that he can’t set his bomb surrounded by all these Nazis.
Donowitz pantomimes crossing his legs and setting the bomb on his ankle in his seat. Then getting up and dropping it in the back of the auditorium in the dark.
Hirschberg doesn’t get it.
HIRSCHBER
What-a?
(What?)
Donny pantomimes again, more exaggerated, and with less patience.
HIRSCHBERG
Affirm-ato, affirm-ato
(Affirmative, affirmative.)
SGT. DONOWITZ
They-o look-o screen-a, not-o you-a.
(They’re looking at the screen, not you.)
HIRSCHBERG
Fantastic-o.
(Fantastic.)
SGT. DONOWITZ
After-teri, set-ta, five-o moment-o
(pointing to
watch)
You-a, pphisst.
(After you set the bomb, wait five minutes, and get out of here.)
HIRSCHBERG
What-o?
(What?)
SGT. DONOWITZ
Confussi-i, confuss-i, confuss-i.
(Confused, confused, confused.)
What-a, and-o what-o, same-o?
(I thought “What-a” meant “What.”
Does “What-o” mean “What,” as well?)
HIRSCHBERG
Oh-o, sorr-o, I-o meant-a “What-a.”
(Oh, sorry, I meant what.)
SGT. DONOWITZ
After-teri, you-a set-ta bom-a,
five-o moment-o, you-a, fuck-o pphisst.
(After you set the bomb, wait five minutes and get the fuck out of here.)
HIRSCHBERG
Affirm-ato, affirm-ato.
(Affirmative, affirmative.)
SGT. DONOWITZ
Good-a, luck-a.
(Good luck.)
Donowitz stands up from his seat and walks out of the dark auditorium into the lobby. The Nazi guards/ushers are gone, and the lobby is completely empty. Seeing the STAIRS leading down to the WATER CLOSET/BATHROOM, he descends them to plant the Boom-a—I mean, the bomb.
DESCENDING THE STAIRS
leading to the water closet. Like a lot of old cinemas, not only was the water closet located under the auditorium, you had to pass through a rather large SMOKING LOUNGE to get to it. In the smoking lounge are TEN NAZI ENLISTED MEN, the guards/ushers for the event, smoking and indulging in soldiers’ gossip. They’re all in dress uniforms, and all are armed.
Donowitz, in his tuxedo, acts cool and walks right through them.
They look up but don’t disturb their time-off vibe.
Donny enters the big water closet. Except for ONE LONE NAZI ENLISTED MAN at the urinal, it would appear as if
Donny has the whole washroom to himself.
He enters the privacy of a toilet stall and locks the door.
MARCEL IN LOBBY
He descends the stairs leading down from the projection booth into the empty lobby. He goes to one of the auditorium doors
and peers inside.
WE SEE THE SCREEN AND THE AUDIENCE FROM MARCEL’S POV in the back of the room. The audience seems riveted to Fredrick’s exploits onscreen.
Marcel closes the door and, with a KEY, DEADBOLTS it SHUT.
INSIDE THE AUDITORIUM
WE PAN OFF THE SCREEN to Marcel, who locks the two doors on either side of the screen . . . Due to curtains placed there, no one notices Marcel’s actions.
Marcel then goes BEHIND THE SCREEN. WE SEE THE IMAGE
(backward) of Fredrick’s sniper battle HUGE, COVERING THE ENTIRE SIDE OF THE ROOM . . . A PILE of over 300 nitrate FILM PRINTS lies like a junk pile, right behind the screen.
Sitting down in a wooden chair facing the screen and pile-o-film, he lights up a cigarette, an absolute no-no in a cinema of this era, but tonight, what does it matter?
He smokes and waits for his cue to . . . BURN IT DOWN!
FREDRICK IN OPERA BOX
alongside Hitler, Goebbels, Francesca, and Boormann. Onscreen
the battle rages. He leans over and whispers something in Goebbel’s ear we can’t hear. Goebbels makes a very sympathetic face (at least sympathetic for Goebbels) and says in German:
GOEBBELS
Perfectly understandable, dear boy.
You go now, and we’ll see you after
the show.
He exits the opera box and walks to the projection booth door. He raps on the door in a trying to be amusing way.
The door opens, just a little bit. Shosanna, not friendly, stares at him.
He, as usual, is all smiles and charm.
They speak in FRENCH, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:
FREDRICK
Are you the manager of this cinema?
I want my money back. That actor in
the movie stinks.
He laughs.
She doesn’t even smile. She says, all serious business:
SHOSANNA
What are you doing here?
FREDRICK
I came to visit you.
SHOSANNA
Can’t you see how busy I am?
FREDRICK
Then allow me to lend an assist.
SHOSANNA
Fredrick, it’s not funny. You can’t
be here. This is your premiere. You
need to be out there with them.
As Fredrick prepares to tell his little tale with all the charm at his command, Shosanna listens, knowing the third reel is just about over and her big reel change is coming up.
FREDRICK
Normally, you would be right.
And for all the other films I do,
I intend to endure evenings like
tonight in the proper spirit.
However, the fact remains, this film
is based on my military exploits.
And in this case, my exploits
consisted of me killing many men. Consequently, the part of the film
that’s playing now, . . . I don’t like watching this part.
SHOSANNA
Fredrick, I am sorry, but—
FREDRICK
—So, I thought I’d come up here
and do what I do best, annoy you.
And from the look on your face, it
would appear I haven’t lost my touch.
DONNY IN TOILET
Sgt. Donowitz, with BOMB in his lap, sets the timer for six minutes from now. He then places the bomb in the back of the toilet tank.
CAMERA ON FLOOR OF WATER CLOSET
We see the tile of the floor stretch out before us. We see
Donny’s feet in the closed toilet stall. We HEAR the OFFSCREEN Nazi enlisted man finish his piss. Then HIS SHOES WALK
THROUGH FRAME . . . WE FOLLOW THEM TO . . . the SINK . . . WE STAY ON the shoes . . . as WE HEAR the Soldier WASH HIS HANDS . . . THEN
. . . THE CAMERA RISES UP HIS PANT LEG . . . till . . . WE’RE EYE LEVEL with the German soldier, with an ARMY CAP on his head, who’s done washing his hands . . . THEN . . . the soldier removes
his cap, brushes some bangs out of his face, and WE SEE
THE SWASTIKA HAND-CARVED INTO HIS FOREHEAD, THE UNDENIABLE MARK OF THE BASTERDS. He SPLASHES some WATER ON HIS FACE, puts his
cap back on his head, and joins his comrades in the smoking lounge. As he exits THE FRAME, he says to somebody OFFSCREEN;
SWASTIKA FOREHEAD
(GERMAN)
Hey, Fritz, you owe me three cigarettes. Now pay up.
SHOSANNA AND FREDRICK
Fredrick still outside the doorway, and Shosanna still baring the way.
SHOSANNA
I have to get prepared for the reel change.
FREDRICK
Let me do it?
SHOSANNA
No.
FREDRICK
Oh, please, it’s been two years since I’ve done a reel change.
SHOSANNA
I said, no.
FREDRICK
(cute whine)
Come on, it’s my premiere.
SHOSANNA
Are you so used to the Nazis kissing your ass, you’ve forgotten what the
word “no” means? No, Fredrick, you
can’t come in here. Now go away!
No subtitles for Fredrick needed this time. He gets it.
He does a one-armed PILE-DRIVE PUSH on the door, knocking both it OPEN and Shosanna back into the room.
Fredrick, a different cat than we’ve seen up till now, enters the booth, closing the door behind him and LOCKING it.
The quite startled Shosanna says to Fredrick:
SHOSANNA
Fredrick, you hurt me.
FREDRICK
Well, it’s nice to know you can feel something.
Even if it’s just physical pain.
Fredrick steps forward . . .
Shosanna steps backward . . .
FREDRICK
I’m not a man you say “Go away”
to. There’s over three hundred
dead bodies in Russia that, if
they could, would testify to that.
After what I’ve done for you, you disrespect me at your peril.
BACK TO WASHROOM
The Swastika forehead soldier gets a light for his cigarette.
He takes a big drag.
SOLDIER’S POV
He faces the washroom, and down that long row, he sees Donny emerge from the toilet stall. His tuxedo jacket is off and
draped over his right hand. Sporting the white dress shirt and black tuxedo vest, he’s quite far away, so now he just
looks like some guy in a tux who just finished taking a shit. Donny walks toward us . . .
CU SWASTIKA FOREHEAD
seeing him get closer . . .
SOLDIER POV
Donny gets closer . . .
CU SWASTIKA FOREHEAD
seeing him closer still . . .
SOLDIER POV
Donny gets closer . . .
CU SWASTIKA FOREHEAD
begins to notice . . .
SOLDIER POV
Donny getting closer, begins to notice the German soldier notice him . . .
CU SWASTIKA FOREHEAD
Now Donny is close enough for the soldier to recognize. His face SCREAMS:
SWASTIKA FOREHEAD
The Bear Jew!!!
The soldier’s GUN is out of its holster and rising toward Donny’s chest . . .
WHEN... 
Donny raises his right arm, with the tuxedo jacket on it, and FIRES a GUN concealed under it.
HITTING Swastika Forehead in the chest . . . who finishes raising his GUN, FIRING, HITTING Donny in the chest . . .
The two soldiers FIRE INTO each other . . . till their weapons are empty, and the two men lie dead on the floor.
The ten other NAZIS in the room stand shocked at what just happened in front of them.
SHOSANNA AND FREDRICK IN THE PROJECTION ROOM
Fredrick hears the gunshots below them and turns toward the door.
FREDRICK
What the hell was that?
While Fredrick’s back is turned, Shosanna takes a GUN out of her pocket and SHOOTS Fredrick THREE TIMES in the back . . .
. . . He CRASHES HARD into the door, then FALLS FACE FIRST to the floor . . .
Shosanna, gun in hand, looks out the projection booth window into the audience . . .
The ONSCREEN BATTLE rages so LOUDLY with GUNFIRE that her weapon didn’t stand a chance of being heard.
Her eyes go from the audience . . .
. . . up to the big screen . . .
. . . which holds FREDRICK ZOLLER in a tight, handsome CLOSEUP.
The face on the silver screen breaks the young girl’s heart . . .
. . . She looks to his body, lying face down on the floor, blood flowing from the holes she put in his back . . .
. . . His body moves a little, and he lets out a painful MOAN . . .
. . . DYING though he is, at this moment Fredrick is still ALIVE . . .
Shosanna moves to him . . .
. . . She touches him, and he lets out another MOAN . . .
. . . She turns his body over on its back . . .
. . . He’s holding a LUGER in his hand . . .
. . . He FIRES TWICE . . .
BANG BANG
Two bullets HIT HER POINT BLANK IN THE CHEST . . .
THROWING HER against the wall, then FALLING FORWARD on her knees to the floor . . .
. . . Fredrick, Luger still in hand, takes aim from the floor . . .
... FIRES... 
HITTING the bloody girl on the floor, in the thigh . . .
. . . SPINNING her BODY around in agony . . .
Like he did to the Russian onscreen, he picks her apart, one bullet at a time . . .
... FIRES... 
A BULLET BLOWS OFF THE HEEL OF HER FOOT . . .
The Luger drops to floor. Fredrick DIES.
Our young French Jewish heroine lies on the projection booth floor in a pool of her own blood, her body RIDDLED with bullets, her nerve endings wracked with pain, CRIPPLED and DYING . . .
WHEN... 
. . . The little bell on the 1st projector starts to ring, informing the projectionist it’s time for the REEL CHANGE.
Dying or not, if Shosanna intends to get her revenge, she’s going to have to lift her ass off the floor and execute this fucking reel change.
CINEMA AUDITORIUM
The battle onscreen continues. The audience is riveted.
The FUHRER
watches, completely caught up in the dramatic spectacle.
He says to Goebbels in German:
HITLER
Extraordinary, Joseph, simply extraordinary.
This is your finest
film yet.
Goebbels is beyond proud. He smiles to Francesca, who proudly pats his hand.
PROJECTION BOOTH
Shosanna, bloody, crippled, and fucked, with great and painful effort, PULLS HERSELF OFF THE FLOOR . . .
AUDITORIUM
Hirschberg, sitting in his seat, SETS the BOMB on his ankle, then stands up and begins scooting past everybody in his row’s knees.
PROJECTION BOOTH
Like the German heroine in one of Riefenstahl’s mountain films, Shosanna CLIMBS UP the 35mm film projector, like it was
Pitz Palu . . .
FILM ONSCREEN
Private Zoller FIRING away from his perch. In the top far-
right corner of the FRAME, WE SEE the 1st REEL CHANGE MARK . . .

Shosanna hanging onto the projector, waiting for the 2nd reel change mark. It’s an agonizing effort . . .
BEHIND THE SCREEN

ON THE SILVER SCREEN FREDRICK’S EX CU
CUT TO
ON SILVER SCREEN MATCHING SHOSANNA EX CU
CAMERA in the exact same placement, same background (B/W sky), SLIGHT LOW ANGLE LOOKING UP, so onscreen Shosanna is looking down on the Nazis, the way Fredrick was looking down on the Russians. The way this HUGE IMAGE OF SHOSANNA’S GIANT FACE stares down the auditorium of Nazis brings to mind Orwells “1984”
Big Brother.
HITLER and GOEBBELS
React.
HIRSCHBERG
standing in the middle of the aisle, turns toward the screen. When he sees Shosanna’s GIANT FACE, he’s gobsmacked.
BEHIND SCREEN
Marcel sitting in the chair, with his cigarette, before the
EVEN MORE GIANT FACE OF SHOSANNA
SHOSANNA’S GIANT FACE ONSCREEN
She stares down the packed house of Nazis and says in FRENCH:
SHOSANNA’S GIANT FACE
I have a message for Germany. I’m interrupting your Nazi propaganda horseshit to inform you dispicable German swine that you’re all going to die.
HITLER and GOEBBELS
react.
HIRSCHBERG
reacts.
MARCEL
smiles.
SHOSANNA’S GIANT FACE
And I want you to look deep in the face of the Jew who’s going to do it.
AUDITORIUM AUDIENCE
While the shocked German audience is transfixed to the screen, behind the heads of most of them . . .
The BOMB Landa set in Hitler and Goebbels’s opera box . . .
EXPLODES.
BLOWING TO SMITHEREENS HITLER, FRANCESA, and BOORMANN, and propelling GOEBBELS, still in his theater seat, across the auditorium, into the opposite wall and taking out a portion of the ceiling as well.
The crowd reacts . . .
The explosion causes the huge chandelier from Versailles to topple from its jury-rigged placement and CRASH onto the
audience below . . .
ONSCREEN THE GIANT FACE OF SHOSANNA finishes her WAR CRY.
SHOSANNA’S GIANT FACE
My name is Shosanna Dreyfus, and this is the face of Jewish vengeance! Marcel, BURN IT DOWN!
BEHIND THE SCREEN
Marcel takes his cigarette and FLICKS IT into the pile of nitrate film.
ONSCREEN SHOSANNA’S GIANT FACE LAUGHS MANIACALLY at the scrambling little Nazis, running in a panic, as FLAMES LIKE
OUT OF A GIANT BLAST FURNACE BURST THROUGH SHOSANNA’S FACE and CLIMB UP THE WALLS of the cinema.
The AUDIENCE
STAMPEDES toward the exits . . .
HIRSCHBERG
with bomb set on ankle, is caught in a massive “Day of the Locust”
SWARM OF BODIES . . .
People frantically pound on locked doors, trapping them to their grizzly fate.
The FLAMES and FIRE spread through the auditorium . . .
Hirschberg, caught in the people crunch, knows this is it.
HIS ANKLE BOMB GOES OFF
right underneath everybody in the room.
The effect this has on the people in the room is very similar
to that of the effect an M-80 blowing up in an ant hill would have on the ants. The auditorium is a literal red rain of legs, arms, heads, torsos, and asses.
THEN... ,
DONOWITZ’S TOILET BOMB
BLOWS UP UNDERNEATH the auditorium.
COLLAPSING THE CINEMA AND BLOWING OUT THE FRONT OF THE THEATER.
As MADAME MIMEUX’S CINEMA BURNS . . .
These SUBTITLES APPEAR ONSCREEN as if on a military teletype:
“OPERATION KINO A COMPLETE SUCCESS.”
FADE OUT
FADE UP
“HITLER DEAD. GOEBBELS DEAD. BOORMANN DEAD. GOERING DEAD. ZOLLER DEAD. MOST OF HIGH COMMAND DEAD.”

CUT TO
EXT—WOODS—MORNING
It’s a misty early morning in a woodsy area. The German truck, with Aldo and Utivich in the back, and Landa and Herrman in the front, comes to a stop.
LANDA and HERRMAN IN THE TRUCK CAB
Herrman, behind the wheel, tells Landa in German:
HERRMAN
These are the American lines, sir.
In the back of the truck sit the two last remaining members of the Basterds, Lt. Aldo Raine and Pfc. Smithson Utivich, both with their hands cuffed behind their backs.
Landa and Herrman appear at the truck rear. Landa says in ENGLISH:
COL. LANDA
Okay, gentlemen, you can climb down.
Aldo and Utivich climb down from the truck.
Col. Landa indicates for Herrman to remove the handcuffs from the two prisoners.
He does.
COL. LANDA
Herrman, hand them your weapon.
He does.
Col. Landa hands over his LUGER and his very-cool-looking S.S.
DAGGER.
COL. LANDA
I am officially surrendering myself
over to you, Lieutenant Raine. We are your prisoners.
LT. ALDO
Thank you very much, Colonel. Utivich, cuff the colonel’s hands behind his back.
COL. LANDA
Is that really necessary?
As Utivich cuffs the Colonel’s hands behind his back, Aldo says:
LT. ALDO
I’m a slave to appearances.
Then Aldo takes the Luger and SHOOTS HERRMAN DEAD.
The bound Col. Landa is appalled.
COL. LANDA
Are you mad? What have you done? I made a deal with your general for that man’s life!
LT. ALDO
Yeah, they made that deal, but they don’t give a fuck about him, they
need you.
COL. LANDA
You’ll be shot for this.
LT. ALDO
Naw, I don’t think so, more like I’ll
be chewed out. I’ve been chewed out before. You know, Utivich and myself heard that deal you made with the brass. End the war tonight? I’d make that deal. How ’bout you, Utivich, you make that deal?
UTIVICH
I’d make that deal.
LT. ALDO
I don’t blame ya. Damn good deal.
And that pretty little nest ya
feathered for yourself. Well, if
you’re willing to barbecue the whole high command, I suppose that’s worth certain considerations. Now I don’t
care about you gettin’ pensions,
merit badges, ticker-tape parades,
who gives a damn, let’s all go home.
But I do have one question.
When you go to your little place on
Nantucket island, I imagine you gonna
take off that handsome-looking S.S.
uniform of yours, ain’t ya?
For the first time in the movie, Col. Landa doesn’t respond.
LT. ALDO
That’s what I thought. Now that . . .
. . . I can’t abide. How bout you,
Utivich, can you abide it?
UTIVICH
Not one damn bit, sir.
LT. ALDO
I mean if I had my way, you’d wear
that goddamn uniform for the rest of
our pecker-suckin’ life. But I’m
aware that ain’t practical. I mean
at some point ya gotta hafta take it off.
He opens Landa’s S.S. DAGGER and holds the blade in front of Hans’s face.
LT. ALDO
So I’m gonna give you a little
somethin you can’t take off.
CU COL. LANDA
The dagger has just completed carving a swastika deep into his forehead.
COL. LANDA’S POV
On the ground, looking up at Aldo, bloody knife in hand, who straddles him. And Utivich, who’s next to him. The two Basterds admire Aldo’s handiwork.
Aldo turns to Uitivich and says:
LT. ALDO
You know somethin’, Utivich? I think this just might be my masterpiece.
They ghoulishly giggle.
