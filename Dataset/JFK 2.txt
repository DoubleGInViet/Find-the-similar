FERRIE
Do you mind if I smoke, Mr. Garrison?

JIM

(holds up his pipe)
How could I?	Dave, as you know,
President Kennedy was assassinated

on Friday.	A man named Lee Harvey
Oswald was arrested as a suspect and
then was murdered yesterday by a man
named Jack Ruby.
(on each name, watching

Ferrie's reaction)
We've heard reports that Oswald spent
the summer in New Orleans and we've
been advised you knew Oswald pretty
well.

FERRIE

That's not true.	I never met anybody
named Oswald.	Anybody who told you
that has to be crazy.

JIM

But you are aware, he served in your
Civil Air Patrol unit when he was a
teenager.

FERRIE

No... if he did, I don't remember
him.	There were lots of kids in and
out... y'know.

JIM

(hands him a current
newspaper)
I'm sure you've seen this.	Perhaps

you knew this man under another name?

FERRIE
No, I never saw him before in my
life.
 

JIM
Well that must've been mistaken

information we got.	Thanks for
straightening it out for us.
(puffs on pipe, Ferrie

looks relieved; images
of the funeral
continue on the TV)
There is one other matter that's
come up, Dave.	We were told you

took a trip to Texas shortly after
the assassination of Friday.

FERRIE
Yeah, now that's true.	I drove to

Houston.

JIM
What was so appealing about Houston?

FERRIE
I hadn't been there ice skating in

many years, and I had a couple of

young friends with me, and we decided
we wanted to go ice skating.

JIM

Dave, may I ask why the urge to go
ice skating in Texas happened to
strike you during one of the most

violent thunderstorms in recent
memory?

FERRIE
Oh, it was just a spur of the moment

thing...	the storm wasn't that bad.

JIM
I see.	And where did you drive?

FERRIE
We went straight to Houston, and

then Saturday night we drove to
Galveston and stayed over there.

JIM
Why Galveston?

FERRIE
No particular reason.	Just to go

somewhere.

JIM
And then Sunday?

FERRIE
 

In the morning we went goose hunting.
Then headed home, but I dropped the

boys off to see some relatives and I
stayed in Hammond.

JIM
Did you bag any geese on this trip?

FERRIE
I believe the boys got a couple.

JIM

But the boys told us they didn't get
any.

FERRIE
(fidgeting, lighting

another cigarette)
Oh yes, well, come to think of it,
they're right.	We got to where the

geese were and there were thousands
of them.	But you couldn't approach
them.	They were a wise bunch of
birds.

JIM
Your young friends also told us you

had no weapons in the car.	Dave,
isn't it a bit difficult to hunt for
geese without a shotgun?

FERRIE

Yes, now I remember, Mr. Garrison.
I'm sorry, I got confused.	We got
out there near the geese and it was

only then we realized we'd forgotten
our shotguns.	Stupid, right?	So of
course we didn't get any geese.

JIM

I see.
(stands up)
Dave thank you for your time.	I'm
sorry it has to end inconveniently
for you, but I'm going to have you

detained for further questioning by
the FBI.

FERRIE
(shaken)

Why?	What's wrong?

JIM
Dave, I find your story simply not
believable.
 

Lou and the two cops escort Ferrie out of the office as Jim turns to the television image of Kennedy's final moments of rest. The bugler plays taps. John Jr., 3 years old, in an image which will become famous, salutes his Dad farewell.

The riderless horse stands lonely against the Washington sky.

FBI OFFICE - NEW ORLEANS - NEXT DAY(1963)

At a small press conference, the FBI spokesman reads a statement.

FBI SPOKESMAN
Gentlemen, this afternoon the FBI
released David W. Ferrie of New

Orleans.	After extensive questioning
and a thorough background check, the

Bureau found no evidence that...

GARRISON'S OFFICE - SIMULTANEOUS WITH PREVIOUS SCENE

In Garrison's office see the same broadcast, on the portable television. Lou, Broussard, Numa and Jim watch.

FBI SPOKESMAN

(on TV)
...Mr. Ferrie knew Lee Harvey Oswald
or that he has had any connection
with the assassination of President
Kennedy.	The Special Agent in Charge

would like to make clear that Mr.
Ferrie was brought in for questioning

by the District Attorney of Orleans
parish, not by the Federal Bureau of
Investigation.	The Bureau regrets

any trouble this may have caused Mr.
Ferrie...

NEWSMAN 9
In national news, President Johnson

has announced the creation of a blue
ribbon presidential commission to
probe the events in Dallas.

Lou looks at Jim, angry.

LOU

Correct me if I'm wrong.	I thought
we were on the same side.	What the
hell business is it of theirs to say

that?

BILL
Pretty fast, wasn't it.	The way
they let him go.
 

JIM
They must know something we don't.

(dismisses it)
So, let's get on with our lives,
gentlemen... we got plenty of home

grown crimes to prosecute.

He reaches to turn off the TV and get back to work. The last image on the TV is:

NEWSMAN 9
The Commission will be headed by

Chief Justice of the United States
Supreme Court, Earl Warren, and is
expected to head off several

Congressional and Texas inquiries
into the assassination.	On the panel

are Allen Dulles, ex-chief of the
CIA, Representative Gerald Ford,
John J. McCloy, former head of Chase

Manhattan Bank...

Jim flicks the TV off as the overture ends.

AERIAL SHOT - WASHINGTON, D.C. - DAY(1966)

We look down at the White House from the plane's point of view. A subtitle reads: "THREE YEARS LATER."

INTERIOR OF PLANE

SENATOR RUSSELL LONG

(looking out the window)
That's a mess down there, Jim.	We've
bitten off more "Vietnam" that we

can possibly chew.

Jim, now 46, reads the front page of THE WASHINGTON POST which details the latest battle in Vietnam. He sits next to Senator Long from Louisiana, in his 50's, who's drinking a whiskey. They're on a crowded businessman's shuttle. We see a close-up of a newspaper article about the Vietnam war: "more troops asked by Westmoreland."

LONG

(continuing)
Sad thing is the way it's screwing

up this country, all these hippies
running around on drugs, the way
young people look you can't tell a

boy from a girl anymore.	I saw a
girl the other day, she was pregnant -
you could see her whole belly, and
you know what she painted on it?
"Love Child."	It's fuckin' outa

control.	Values've gone to hell,
 

Jim... Course it figures when you

got somebody like that polecat Johnson

in the White House.

JIM

I sometimes feel things've gone
downhill since John Kennedy was
killed, Senator.

LONG

Don't get me started on that.	Those

Warren Commission fellows were pickin'

gnat shit out of pepper.	No one's
gonna tell me that kid did the
shooting job he did from that damned

bookstore.

STEWARDESS
Here you go, Senator Long.

The stewardess brings more drinks.

JIM
(surprised)

I	thought the FBI test-fired the rifle to make sure it could be done?

LONG
Sure, three experts and not one of
them could do it!	They're telling

us Oswald got off three shots with
world-class precision from a manual

bolt action rifle in less than six
seconds - and accordin' to his Marine
buddies he got Maggie's drawers - he

wasn't any good.	Average man would
be lucky to get two shots off, and I
tell ya the first shot would always
be the best.	Here, the third shot's
perfect.	Don't make sense.	And

then they got that crazy bullet
zigzagging all over the place so it

hits Kennedy and Connally seven times.
One "pristine" bullet?	That dog
don't hunt.

JIM

You know, something always bothered
me about that from day one, and I
can't put my finger on it.

LONG

If I were investigatin', I'd round
up the 100 best riflemen in the world

and find out which ones were in Dallas

that day.	You been duck hunting?	I
 

think Oswald was a good old-fashioned
decoy.	What'd he say?	"I'm just a

patsy."	Out of the mouth of babes
y'ask me.

JIM
You think there were other men

involved, Russell?

Russell looks at Jim quizzically and laughs.

LONG

Hell, you're the District Attorney.
You read the Warren Report - and
then you tell me you're satisfied

Lee Oswald shot the President all by
his lonesome.

JIM
Russell, honestly you sound like one

of those kooky critics spreading
paranoia like prairie fire.	I just
can't believe the Chief Justice of
the United States would put his name
on something that wasn't true.

LONG

(to the stewardess)
Honey, another one of these.	This
one's as weak as cricket pee-pee.

Yessir, you mark my words, Jim,
Vietnam's gonna cost Johnson '68 and

it's gonna put that other varmint
Nixon in - then watch your hide,
'cause there ain't no offramps on a

freeway to Hell!

GARRISON'S STUDY - NIGHT(1966)

The study is lined with bookshelves up to the ceiling; we see photos of family, a chess set. Jim, smoking his pipe, reads in a red leather chair from one of the 26 thick Warren Commission volumes piled all over the place. Liz enters. Jasper, now 7, draws on a piece of paper on the floor at Jim's feet.

LIZ

Jim, dinner's just about ready...
I've got a surprise for you... tried
something new... Jim?	Jim, dinner.

JIM

(lost in thought)
Mmmmm... sure smells good... but
Egghead, do you realize Oswald was

interrogated for twelve hours after
 

the assassination, with no lawyer
present, and nobody recorded a word

of it?	I can't believe it.	A police
captain with 30 years experience and
a crowd of Federal agents just had

to know that with no record anything
that Oswald said would be inadmissible
in court.

LIZ

Come on now, we'll talk about it at
the table, dinner's getting cold.
(to Jasper)
What are you doing in here?

JASPER
Daddy said it was all right if I was

real quiet.

		JIM		
(rising	to	dinner)	
Sure it	is.	Freckle Face,	if I ever
handled	a minor	felon like	that,
it'd be	all	over the papers.  I'd
catch hell.	And this is the alleged
murderer of	the	President?	

GARRISON DINING ROOM - (1966)

Two-year-old Elizabeth watches "Crusader Rabbit" on TV as the new one-year-old sits in diapers with Liz at one end of the dinner table. Jim sits at the other end. There are five kids now, ages 7, 5, 4, 2 and 1... and Mattie, the housekeeper. Dinner's finished, they pass plates, the children horse around... the boxer dog, Touchdown, begs for a piece of the action. Jim, not a big eater, feeds him ice cream.

JIM
Again and again they ignore credible

testimony, leads are never followed
up, its conclusions are selective,
there's no index, it's one of the
sloppiest, most disorganized
investigations I've ever seen.	Dozens

and dozens of witnesses in Dealey
Plaza that day are saying they heard

shots coming from the Grassy Knoll
area in front of Kennedy and not the
Book Depository behind him, but it's

all broken down and spread around
and you read it and the point gets
lost.

MATTIE

I never did believe it either!
 

LIZ

(politely listening)
Uh huh... Mattie, I'll do the dishes,
you take Be up now.	And Elizabeth,

too, your bedtime, honey.

ELIZABETH JR.
Nahhhh!	I don't wanna go to bed!

LIZ
Honey, that was three years ago - we

all tried so hard to put that out of
our minds, why are you digging it up
again?	You're the D.A. of New

Orleans.	Isn't the Kennedy
assassination a bit outside your

domain?	I mean all those important
people already studied it.

JIM
I can't believe a man as intelligent

as Earl Warren ever read what's in
those volumes.

LIZ
Well maybe you're right, Jim.	I'll

give you one hour to solve the case...
until the kids are in bed.
(rising, she puts her

arms around him from
behind and kisses

his ear)
Then you're mine and Mr. Kennedy can
wait 'til morning.	Come on, everybody

say goodnight to Daddy.

JASPER
(showing his drawing)
Dad, look what I drew.

JIM

(rising)
That's something, Jasper.	What is
it?

JASPER

A rhinoceros.	Can I stay up another
hour?

Virginia and Snapper each get one of Jim's shoes as he dances with them, holding one with each hand.

JIM
(dancing)

Pickle and Snapper, my two favorite
 

dancing partners.

As the children dance, they fall off Jim's feet, laughing and giggling. He throws each in the air and kisses them.

JIM
Goodnight, my doodle bugs.

KIDS
Goodnight, Daddy.

Liz comes over, smiling.	Jim takes her in his arms.

LIZ
One hour, y'hear?	Some Saturday

night date you are.
(sighs)

Mama warned me this would happen if
I married such a serious man.

JIM
Oh, she did, huh?	When I come up

I'll show you how Saturday night got
invented.

GARRISON STUDY - LATER THAT NIGHT(1966)

The clock on mantelpiece reads 3 A.M. Jim is alone, smoking his pipe.

In the stillness, his mind crawls all over the place. The camera closes on the thickly-worded pages of the Warren Report.

FLASHBACK TO the Warren Commission hearing room in Dallas, 1964. We hear thin, echoey sound as the attorneys question some of the witnesses.

The overall effect is vague and confusing, as is much of the Warren Report. A Mr. Ball is questioning Lee Bowers, the switchman in the railroad yard. Bowers, in his early 40's, has a trustworthy, working-man face and a crew cut.

BOWERS
I sealed off the area, and I held

off the trains until they could be
examined, and there was some

transients taken on at least one
train.

ATTORNEY
Mr. Bowers... is there anything else

you told me I haven't asked you about
that you can think of?

BOWERS
 

Nothing that I can recall.

ATTORNEY
Witness is excused.

Jim, upset, reads on... Another witness, Sgt. D.V. Harkness of the Dallas Police responds to a second attorney.

SGT. HARKNESS
Well we got a long freight that was

in there, and we pulled some people
off of there and took them to the
station.

We see another FLASHBACK - to the Dallas rail yards on the day of the assassination. Three hoboes are being pulled off the freight by the Dallas policemen.

ATTORNEY (V.O.)
You mean some transients?

SGT. HARKNESS (V.O.)

Tramps and hoboes.

ATTORNEY (V.O.)

Were all those questioned?

FLASHBACK TO Dealey Plaza an hour or less after the assassination. The three hoboes are marched by shotgun-toting policemen to the Sheriff's office at Dealey Plaza. We note that they do not look much like hoboes.

SGT. HARKNESS (V.O.)
Yes, sir, they were taken to the
station and questioned.

JIM

(astounded)
And?
(writes "incomplete")

ATTORNEY (V.O.)

(switching subjects)
I want to go back to this Amos Euins.
(voices dribble off)

BOWERS (V.O.)

Yes sir, traffic had been cut off
into the area since about 10, but
there were three cars came in during

this time from around noon till the
time of the shooting... the cars
circled the parking lot, and left
like they were checking the area,
one of the drivers seemed to have

something he was holding to his
 

mouth... the last car came in about
7 to 10 minutes before the shooting,

a	white Chevrolet, 4-door Impala, muddy up to the windows.

The camera's point of view is now from the railroad tower near Dealey Plaza. We are fourteen feet off the ground, overlooking the parking lot behind the Grassy Knoll. The shot includes this last car circling in the lot.

BOWERS
Towards the underpass, I saw two men

standing behind a picket fence...
they were looking up towards Main
and Houston and following the caravan

as it came down.	One of them was
middle-aged, heavyset.	The other

man was younger, wearing a plaid
shirt and jacket.

Inside the railroad tower, Bowers glances out, busy with the main board, flashing lights, a train coming in.

BOWERS
There were two other men on the

eastern end of the parking lot.
Each of 'me had uniforms.

We see the parking lot from Bower's point of view - at a distance, but we have a sense of the cars and see the men at a distance, tow uniformed men. The parking lot is bumper-to-bumper with a sea of cars. Rain that morning has muddied the lot. These brief images are elaborated on later.

BOWERS

At the time of the shooting there
seemed to be some commotion... I
just am unable to describe - a flash
of light or smoke or something which
caused me to feel that something out

of the ordinary had occurred there
on the embankment...

We feel the growing intensity: music, drums - but all blurred. We see a puff of smoke but no sound because of the window Bowers is glancing through. A motorcycle cop shoots up the Grassy Knoll incline. People run, blurring into a larger mosaic of confusion. Bowers is confused, seeing this.

INTERCUT with Jim's heart pounding as he reads.

Back in Dealey Plaza, S.M. Holland, an elderly signal supervisor, stands on the parapet of the railway.

HOLLAND (V.O.)

Four shots... a puff of smoke came
 

from the trees... behind that picket
fence... close to the little plaza -

There's no doubt whatever in my mind.

We see the scene from Holland's point of view - the puff of smoke lingering under the trees along the picket fence after the shooting.

GARRISON BEDROOM - ANOTHER NIGHT(1966)

Jim is asleep, having a tortured dream.

DREAMSCAPE FLASHBACK: We see the Zapruder film, in slow-motion and J.F.K.'s face just before he goes behind Stemmons Freeway sign. Jim sits up suddenly.

JIM

NO!

Liz stirs, shaken.

LIZ

Honey, you all right?
(looks at watch)

JIM
It's incredible, honey - the whole

thing.	A Lieutenant Colonel testifies
that Lee Oswald was given a Russian
language exam as part of his Marine

training only a few months before he
defects to the Soviet Union.	A

Russian exam!

LIZ

(sitting up, angered)
I cannot believe this.	It's four-
thirty, Jim Garrison.	I have five
children are gonna be awake in another
hour and ...

JIM

Honey, in all my years in the service
I never knew a single man who was
given a Russian test.	Oswald was a

radar operator.	He'd have about as
much use for Russian as a cat has

for pajamas.

LIZ

These books are getting to your mind,
Mr. Garrison.	I wish you'd stop
readin' them.

JIM

And then this Colonel tries to make
 

it sound like nothing.	Oswald did
badly on the test, he says.	"He

only had two more Russian words right
than wrong."	Ha!	That's like me
saying Touchdown here...

(points to the dog)
...is not very intelligent because I
beat him three games out of five the
last time we played chess.

LIZ
(gives up)

Jim, what is going on, for heaven's
sake!	You going to stay up all night
every night?	For what?	So you'll

be the only man in America who read
the entire 26 volumes of the Warren

Report?

JIM

Liz, do I have to spell it out for
you?	Lee Oswald was no ordinary
soldier.	That was no accident he
was in Russia.	He was probably in
military intelligence.	That's why

he was trained in Russian.

LIZ
(with a quizzical
look)

Honey, go back to sleep, please!

JIM
Goddammit!	I been sleeping for three
years!

She takes him now, gently, and pulls him down on top of her and kisses him.

LIZ

Will you stop rattling on about
Kennedy for a few minutes, honey...
come on.

LAFAYETTE SQUARE - NEW ORLEANS - MORNING(1966)

A Sunday, early. We see a statue of Ben Franklin in an empty square frequented by drunks who doze on benches in a little leafy park in the center of the Square. The camera moves to Jim by himself and then moves to a sedan, pulling up, which disgorges Lou Ivon and Bill Broussard.

JIM
Morning, boys.	Ready for a walking
tour?
 

BILL
At 7:30 Sunday morning?	It's not

exactly fresh blood we're sniffing
here, boss.

JIM
(points)

Old stains, Bill, but just as telling.

TIME CUT TO Jim indicating 531 Lafayette Street, a seedy, faded, three-story building across the street from the square.

JIM
Remember whose office this was back
in '63?	531 Lafayette Street.

LOU

Yeah, Guy Banister.	Ex-FBI man.	He
died couple years ago.

FLASHBACK TO the exterior of the Banister Office on a day in 1963. The door is now clearly labelled "W. GUY BANISTER, INC. INVESTIGATORS." It opens and Banister comes out in slow motion, neatly dressed, rose in his lapel - the same office and same man we saw three years before when he pistol-whipped Jack Martin. Banister seems to be smiling right at us, greeting us.

JIM (V.O.)
Headed the Chicago office.	When he

retired he became a private eye here.
I used to have lunch with him.	John

Birch Society, Minutemen, slightly
to the right of Attila the Hun.
Used to recruit college students to

infiltrate radical organizations on
campus.	All out of this office.
Now come around here, take a look at
this...

Back to the Lafayette Square of 1966.	Jim walks Ivon and

Bill to the corner, to another entrance to the same building - this one with a sign that says "544 Camp Street."

JIM

544 Camp Street.	Same building as

531	Lafayette, right... but different address and different entrances both going to the same place - the offices on the second and third floors.

Bill studies the present sign: "Crescent City Dental Laboratory", and gives Jim a puzzled look.

JIM

Guess who used this address?
 

Lou gets it and glances up. We FLASHBACK TO the exterior of 544 Camp Street in 1963. Lee Oswald comes out the door into a full close-up, now clearly seen by us, and heads out into the street as Guy Banister intercepts him on the sidewalk, holding a leaflet and point to "544 Camp Street stamped on it. Guy seems miffed at Oswald, tells him something quickly, and then moves on.

BANISTER

(under)
See this?	What the hell is this
doing on this piece of paper?
(he moves away)
Asshole.

LOU (V.O.)

My God!	Lee Harvey Oswald.

JIM (V.O.)

Bull's-eye.	How do we know he was
here?	Cause this office address was
stamped on the pro-Casto leaflets he
was handing out in the summer of '63
down on Canal street.	They were the

same leaflets that were found in his
garage in Dallas.

FLASHBACK to Canal Street in New Orleans on a summer day in 1963. Oswald, in a thin tie and white short-sleeved shirt, and wearing a homemade placard reading "Hands Off Cuba"; "Viva Fidel!", is hawking leaflets to pedestrians with two young helpers.

A	large white-haired businessman in a white suit, very distinguished, walks with a friend on Canal Street. Oswald glances at him and meets his eyes. The businessman enters an office building. This man is Clay Bertrand, later known as Clay Shaw.

Some Cubans, led by Carols Bringuier, now appear. One of them, "the Bull", is heavy-set with dark glasses. More of him will also be seen.

JIM

He was arrested that day for fighting
with some anti-Castro Cubans... but

actually he had contacted them a few
days earlier as an ex-Marine trying
to join the anti-Castro crusade.

When they heard he was now pro-Castro,
they paid him a visit.

CARLOS
(haranguing passerby)

He's a traitor, this man!	Don't
 

believe a word he tells you!
(to Oswald)

You sonofabitch, you liar, you're a
Communist, go back to Moscow.

Carlos throws Oswald's leaflets in the air and pulls off his glasses, prepared to fight. Oswald only smiles, and puts his arms down in an X of passivity.

OSWALD

Okay, Carlos, if you want to hit me,
hit me.

There is no real fight, but the police, as if pre-alerted, arrive.

Arrests are made. We see Oswald in a room in the police station, talking with FBI Agent John Quigley. A calendar on the wall shows that it's August, 1963.

JIM (V.O.)
There was no real fight and the

arresting Lieutenant later said he
felt it was a staged incident.	In
jail, Oswald asked to talk to Special

Agent John Quigley of the FBI who
showed up immediately.	They have a
private session.	Oswald is released
and Quigley destroys his notes from
the interview.

In a television studio in 1963, Oswald debates Carlos Bringuier with two moderators.

JIM

But the arrest gets him a lot of
publicity and as a result Oswald
appears on a local TV debate that
established his credentials as a
Communist.

BRINGUIER

But you're a Communist, are you not,
and you defected to Russia.

OSWALD
No, I am not a Communist.	But I am

a Marxist-Leninist.

BRINGUIER

What did you do when you were in
Russia?

OSWALD
(defensive)

I worked while I was there.	I was
 

always under the protection of...
that is to say, I was not under the

protection of the U.S. Government.

Back in 1966, Jim walks with his two assistants.

BILL

What the hell's a Communist like Lee
Oswald doing working out of
Banister's?

JIM

Y'ever heard of a double agent, Bill?
I'm beginning to doubt Oswald was
ever a Communist... after the arrest,

544 Camp Street never appeared on
the pamphlets again.	Now here's

another one for you:	What would you
say if I told you Lee Oswald had
been trained in the Russian language

when he was a Marine?

LOU
I'd say he was probably getting
intelligence training.

JIM

Lou, you were in the Marines.	Who
would be running that training?

LOU
The Office of Naval Intelligence.

JIM
Take a look across the street.

We see the Post Office building across the street.

LOU
Post Office.

JIM

Upstairs.	In 1963 that was the Office
of Naval Intelligence - And just by
coincidence, Banister, before he was

FBI, was ONI.	What do they say?

LOU
"Once ONI, always ONI"?

BILL
Well, he likes to work near his old

pals.

Jim makes a gesture encompassing the whole Square.
 

JIM
Bill, Lou, we're standing in the

heart of the United States
Government's intelligence community
in New Orleans.	That's the FBI there,

the CIA, Secret Service, ONI.	Doesn't
this seem to you a rather strange
place for a Communist to spend his
spare time?

LOU
What are you driving at, boss?

JIM
We're going back into the case, Lou -

the murder of the President.	I want
you to take some money from the Fees

and Fines Account and go to Dallas -
talk to some people.	Bill, I want
you to get Oser on the medical, the

autopsy, Susan on Oswald and Ruby
histories, tax records...

BILL
Lord, wake me, please.	I must be

dreaming.

JIM
No, you're awake, Bill, and I'm dead
serious.	And we're going to start

by tracking down your anonymous source
from three years ago.	How did you

find out Dave Ferrie drove to Texas
that day?

RACETRACK - DAY(1966)

A straggly group of people watch from the grandstands eating hotdogs and talking in small clusters. The horses are running early morning laps. Three men sit apart in the bleachers.

A scared Jack Martin, three years older than when last seen, still wearing the Dick Tracy hat, sucks up coffee like a worm does moisture. He has the red puffy cheeks of an alcoholic and deeply circled, worried eyes. Bill and Jim wait.

JIM

You're not under cross-examination
here, Jack.

What I need is a little clarification about the night Guy Banister beat you over the head with his Magnum. You called our office hopping mad from your hospital bed. Don't tell me you don't remember that?

Jack looks away and doesn't respond.
 

JIM

Here's my problem, Jack.	You told
me you and Guy were good friends for
a long time?

MARTIN

More than ten years.

JIM

And he never hit you before?

MARTIN
Never touched me.

JIM
Yet on November 22, 1963 - the day

of the President's murder - our police
report says he pistol-whipped you
with a .357 Magnum.

(Martin's eyes are
fixed on Jim)
But the police report says you had
an argument over the phone bill.
Here, take a look at it.

(Martin looks at the
report)
Now, does a simple argument over
phone bills sound like a believable
explanation to you?

SUDDEN FLASHBACK to the night of the pistol-whipping. The camera shows Banister laying Martin's head open / the beating the humiliation.

MARTIN
(shaking his head

slowly, dreamily)
No, it involved more than that.

Bill looks at Jim.

JIM
How much more?

MARTIN
(waits)

I don't know if I should talk about
this.

JIM
Well, I'd ask Guy - we were friendly,

you know - heart attack, wasn't it?

MARTIN

If you buy what you read in the paper.
 

JIM

You have other information?

MARTIN

I didn't say that.	All I know is he
died suddenly just before the Warren
Report came out.

JIM

Why did Guy beat you, Jack?

MARTIN
Well, I guess now that Guy's dead,
it don't really matter... it was

about the people hanging around the
office that summer.	I wasn't really

part of the operation, you know.	I
was handling the private-eye work
for Guy when that came in - not much

did - but that's why I was there...
it was a nuthouse.	There were all
these Cubans coming and going.	They
all looked alike to me.

FLASHBACK to Banister's office in 1963. There are Cubans in battle fatigues and combat boots; duffle bags are lying around. David Ferrie, in fatigues, directs the Cubans as they carry crates of ammunition and weapons into a back room. Martin observes from another desk.

MARTIN

Dave Ferrie - you know about him?

JIM (V.O.)

Was he there often?

MARTIN (V.O.)
Often?	He practically lived there.
It was real cloak and dagger stuff.

They called it Operation Mongoose.
The idea was to train all these Cuban
exiles for another invasion of Cuba.
Banister's office was part of a supply
line that ran from Dallas, through

New Orleans to Miami, stockpiling
arms and explosives.

Still in 1963, we see the exterior of Banister's office. A dozen Cubans follow Ferrie downstairs into the street, and pile into several cars, duffels thrown in with them. Ferrie drives the lead car.

JIM (V.O.)
All this right under the noses of

the intelligence community in
 

Lafayette Square?

We see the cars cross the long Lake Pontchartrain Bridge and enter a remote guerrilla training camp. Bayou and jungle are all around.

MARTIN (V.O.)

Sure.	Everybody knew everybody.	It
was a network.	They were working
for the CIA - pilots, black operations

guys, civilians, military - everybody
in those days was running guns
somewhere... Fort Jefferson, Bayou
Bluff, Morgan City... McAllen, Texas
was a big gun-running operation.

At the guerrilla training camp at Lake Pontchartrain in 1963, we see scenes of basic training - shooting, obstacle courses, callisthenics - led by Ferrie and other trainers. Scattered among the Cubans are several white American mercenaries. We catch a glimpse of Oswald and glimpses of several other men we will see again, in sprinklings.

JIM (V.O.)
Where is Banister in all this?

MARTIN (V.O.)

Banister was running his camp north
of Lake Pontchartrain.	Ferrie handled
a lot of the training.	There was a

shooting range and a lot of tropical
terrain like in Cuba.	A few Americans

got trained, too.	Nazi types.
Mercenaries.	But Ferrie was the
craziest.

It's night at the training camp. FBI agents race up in cars in the middle of the night, swarming over the camp, rounding up the trainees.

MARTIN
Anyway, late summer the party ended.

Kennedy didn't want another Bay of
Pigs mess, so he ordered the FBI to
shut down the camps and confiscate

the napalm and the C-4.	There were
a buncha Cubans and a couple Americans

arrested, only you didn't read about
it in the papers.	Just the weapons
got mentioned... 'cause the first

ones behind bars would've been
Banister and Ferrie, but I think the
G-men were just going through the
motions for Washington.	Their hearts
were with their old FBI buddy

Banister.
 

We see FBI agents loading dynamite, bomb casings, arms 155mm artillery shells, etc.

Back at the racetrack in 1966, Jim listens.

MARTIN

Like I said, a fuckin' nuthouse.

JIM

And Oswald?

Martin hesitates. We hear the rhythmic beating of the horse hooves and Martin sucking on the steaming cup of coffee.

MARTIN
(finally)

Yeah, he was there, too... sometimes
he'd be meeting with Banister with
the door shut.	Other times he'd be

shooting the bull with Ferrie.	But
he was there all right.

JIM
Anything more specific, Jack?	It's

important.

FLASHBACK TO Banister's office in 1963. Banister and Martin shooting the breeze as the straight-laced middle-aged secretary, Delphine Roberts, hurries in.

MARTIN (V.O.)

Yeah, one time the secretary got
upset, I remember...

SECRETARY
I can't believe it, Mr. Banister.

Lee Oswald is down on Canal Street
giving out Communist leaflets
supporting Castro!

Banister just looks at her and laughs.

BANISTER
It's okay, Delphine, he's with us.

Back at the racetrack...

JIM
Anyone else involved at Banister's

level?

MARTIN
(shrugs)
There was one guy, I don't know, big

guy, business guy, white hair - I
 

saw him come into the office once.
He looked out of place, y'know -

like a society guy.	Can't remember
his name.
(thinking)

Oswald was with him.

FLASHBACK to Banisters office on a day in 1963. Martin is snooping in Banister's files. Cut to Martin leaving the office as a big businessman with white hair briefly talks to Oswald and then goes into Banister's private office.

MARTIN
He had something to do with money.
I remember him cause Guy, who didn't

kiss anybody's ass, sure kissed his.

Banister lets the man into his private office.

MARTIN

Clay something, that was his name -
Clay.

JIM
Bertrand.	Clay Bertrand?

MARTIN

Yeah!	That's it.
(pause, paranoid)
I don't know.	Maybe it wasn't.	I

gotta go.

JIM
(to Bill)
Clay Bertrand.	He's in the Warren

Report.	He tried to get Oswald a
lawyer.
(to Martin)
Was Kennedy ever discussed, Jack?

MARTIN
Sure.	'Course they hated the

sonofabitch, but...

JIM

The assassination, Jack?

MARTIN
(tightens)
Never.	Not with me sir, never...

Listen, I think I'd better go.	I
said enough.	I said all I'm going
to say.
(rises suddenly)

JIM
 

Hold on, Jack.	What's the problem?

MARTIN
What's the problem?	What's the
problem?	Do I need to spell it out

for you, Mr. Garrison?	I better go.

JIM
Nobody knows what we're talking about,
Jack.

MARTIN

You're so naive, mister.

Martin picks his way nervously down the bleacher benches.

CAR - FRENCH QUARTER - DAY(1966)

Jim drives, with Numa in the front and Bill in the back.

BILL
Well, it's a terrific yard, Chief,

but the man's an obvious alcoholic
with a reputation lower than crocodile
piss.

JIM

Does that bother you, Bill?	I always
wondered in court why it is because
a woman is a prostitute, she has to

have bad eyesight.

BILL
He'll never sign a statement, boss,
let alone get on a witness stand.

JIM

When something's rotten in the land,
Bill, it generally isn't just one
fish, we'll get corroboration...

find this Clay Bertrand.	If I were
a betting man, I'd give you 10 to 1
it's an alias.	Start checking around
the Quarter.

BILL
And the six of us, with almost no

budget and in secret, are going to
solve the case that the Warren
Commission with dozens of support

staff and millions of dollars couldn't
solve.	We can't keep up with the
crimes in the Parish as it is, Chief.

JIM

The murder of a President, Bill, is
 

a crime in Orleans Parish too.	I
didn't pick you because of your legal

skill, you know.

BILL

Gee, thanks boss.

Jim pulls the car over to park.

JIM

But because you're a fighter.	I
like a man who isn't scared of bad
odds.

FRENCH QUARTER SIDEWALK - DAY(1966)

Jim and the others get out of the car and head towards Antoine's Restaurant. A black woman greets him.

BLACK WOMAN

How ya doing, Mr. Garrison?	Remember
me - from the piano bar at the Royal
Orleans?

JIM

I sure do.	We sang "You're the Cream
in My Coffee."

She laughs.	Others move in on him.

JIM
(to Numa)

Make sure we come back here, now.

ANTOINE'S RESTAURANT - DAY(1966)

They enter a busy lunchtime crowd in an elegant eatery. Lou Ivon and Al Oser are waiting for them as they're shown to their table by the Maitre d'.

MAITRE D'
Mr. Garrison, we have not seen enough

of you lately.

JIM

Been too busy, Paul - an elected man
can't have as much fun as he used

to.
(seeing Lou and Al)
Welcome back, Lou.	Find out anything

on those hobos?

Lou's been waiting, excited. He gives Jim blowups of the five hobo photographs.

LOU
 

They took 'em to the Sheriff's office,
not the police station, and they let

'em go.	No record of them ever being
questioned.

JIM
I can't say that comes as a surprise

anymore.

LOU

A photographer from The Dallas Times
Herald got some great shots of them
never published...

The camera moves in on the photographs.

FLASHBACK TO the "hoboes" being escorted to the Sheriff's office - as per Sgt. Harkness' earlier description.

LOU

...take a good look, chief, do any
of 'em look like the hoboes you
remember?

JIM

Hoboes I knew of old used to sleep
in their clothes - these two look
pretty young.

LOU

...not a single frayed collar or
cuff, new haircuts, fresh shaves,

clean hands - new shoe leather.
Look at the ear of the cop... That's
a wire.	What's a cop wearing a

headset for?	I think they're actors,
chief; they're not cops.

Susie Cox arrives.

JIM
Who the hell are they, then!	Hi,

Susie, sit down.
(to Lou)
This could be it.	Let's start looking

for 'em.

How 'bout that railroad man, Lee Bowers? Saw those men at the picket fence?

LOU
Graveyard dead.	August this year.

(Jim curses quietly)
A single car accident on an empty
road in Midlothian, Texas.	The doctor

said he was in some kind of strange
 

shock when he died.
(pause)

JIM
(shares the look)

We need to find more witnesses, Lou.

LOU
There was Rose Cheramie.	A whore.
Two Cubans threw her out of a car on

the way to Dallas.

She talked to a cop from a hospital bed two days before the assassination, said Kennedy would be hit that Friday. She said she was a dope runner for Jack Ruby and that Ruby knew Oswald for years...
