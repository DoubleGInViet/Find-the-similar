JIM
Can we find her?

LOU
Graveyard dead near Big Sandy, Texas

in '65.	Two in the morning on some
highway.	A hit and run.

FLASHBACK to Rose lying dead on an empty highway.

BILL
Why not go right to the horse's mouth,
chief?

Jack Ruby's been rotting in a Dallas jail cell for three years. Maybe he's ready to crack?

JIM

If we go to him our investigation'll
hit the front pages by sunrise.
Blow up right in our face.	Ruby was
just given a new trial.	If he has
something to say, it'll be there.

Susie, what did you find out on
Oswald?

SUSIE
Negative on his tax records.

Classified.	First time I know a
D.A. can't get a tax record.	I put

together a list of all the CIA files
on Oswald that were part of the Warren
Report and asked for them.	There

are about 1200 documents...
(gives it to Jim who
reads)
Oswald in the USSR, in Mexico City,
Oswald and the U2, a CIA 201 personnel

file, a memo from the Director on
 

Oswald, travel and activities - can't
get one of them.	All classified as

secret on the grounds of national
security.	It's real strange.

BILL
Maybe there's more to this, Susie.

The CIA's keeping something from our
enemies.

SUSIE
Yes, but we're talking about a dead

warehouse employee of no political
significance.	Three years later and
he's still classified?	They gave us

his grammar school records, a study
of his pubic hairs... Put it in

context, Bill, of what we know about
Oswald.	Lonely kid, no father,
unstable childhood, high school

dropout - wants to grow up and be a
spy, joins the Marines at 17.	He
learns Russian, he acts overtly
Marxist with two other marines, but
he's stationed at a top secret base

in Japan where U2 spy flights over
Russia originate.	He's discharged
from the Marines supposedly because
his mother's sick.	He stays home 3
days, then with a $1500 ticket from

a $203 bank account, he goes to
Moscow...

FLASHBACK TO Moscow in 1959. We see shots of the city - strange and eerie black-and-white stills. Inside the U.S. Embassy Oswald slaps his passport on the table with a formal letter. Two consuls attend him.

OSWALD
(voice stilted)

I want to renounce my citizenship
and become a Soviet citizen.	I'm
going to make known to them all
information I have concerning the
Marine Corps and my specialty therein,

radar operation...

SUSIE (V.O.)
One of the consuls, John McVickar,
says Oswald's performance was not

spontaneous - it seemed coached.
Oswald gives an interview to a
journalist.

Continuing the Moscow flashback, we see Oswald talking with

a female journalist in his small room in the Hotel Metropole.
 

Again he sounds robotic.

OSWALD
I will never return to the United
States for any reason.	It is a

capitalist country, an exploitive,
racist country.	I am a Marxist since
I was 15.	I've seen poor niggers
and that was a real lesson.	People
hate because they're told to hate,

like school kids.	It's the fashion
to hate people in the U.S.

SUSIE (V.O.)
The Russians are skeptical - want to

send him back.	Maybe they suspect
he's a spy.	He supposedly slashes

his wrists in a suicide attempt so
that they're forced to keep him, and
he disappears for six weeks,

presumably with the KGB.

We see photos of the city of Minks, in Russia, Oswald with various friends and tourists, shots of Lee and Marina with a new baby.

SUSIE

Finally they shuttle him to a radio
factory in Minks where he lives as
high on the hog as he ever has -

he's given 5,000 rubles, a roomy
apartment with a balcony, has affairs

with local girls.

JIM

Makes sense - he's a spokesman.

SUSIE
But he never writes, speaks, or does
any propaganda for the Russians.	He

meets Marina, whose uncle is a colonel
in Soviet intelligence, at a trade
union dance; she thinks he's Russian
the way he speaks, six weeks later
they marry, have a daughter.

NUMA

Didn't someone say he didn't speak
good Russian?

JIM
It's a contradiction, Numa, get used

to them.	The only explanation for
the royal treatment is he did give
them radar secrets.	Or fake secrets.
 

We see documentary shots of the U2 on Russian soil... Francis Gary Powers... The Summit Conference canceled... Eisenhower and Khrushchev.

SUSIE (V.O.)

I don't know if it's coincidence,
but Oswald had a top security
clearance and knew about the U2
program from his days at Atsugi Air
Base in Japan.	Six months after he

arrives in Russia, Francis Gary
Powers' U2 spy flight goes down in
Russia.	That plane was untouchable.
Powers hinted that Oswald could've
given the Russians enough data to

hit it.	As a direct result, the
peace summit between Khrushchev and

Eisenhower failed.	I can't help
thinking of that book Seven Days In
May, maybe someone in our military

didn't want the Peace Conference to
happen, maybe Oswald was part of
that.	It gets weirder.

BILL

Susie, you're an assistant D.A.,
remember.	Stick to what you can
prove in court.

SUSIE

You want facts, Bill?	Okay.	From
1945 to '59 only two U.S. soldiers

defect to Russia.	From '59 to '60,
seven defect, six return, one of
them another Marine a month before

Oswald.	All of them young men made
to seem poor, disenchanted.

JIM
Don't get sidetracked!	How does he

get back to the States?	That's the
point.	Does he have any problems?

SUSIE
None!	The State Department issues

him a new passport in 48 hours and
loans him the money to travel.	He's

never investigated or charged by the
Navy for revealing classified
information or, as far as we know,

debriefed by the CIA.

JIM
This is a man whose secrets cause us
to change our radar patterns in the

Pacific!	He should've been prosecuted
 

as a traitor!

SUSIE
The FBI finally gets around to talking
to him in Dallas and runs a file on

him as a miscreant Communist type.

JIM
But who meets him when he gets off
the boat in New York in June '62?

The screen shows photos of New York: Empty docks... a ship coming in... Wall Street on a Sunday morning - Graphic Weegee-type black-and-white stills, then a photo of Spas T. Raikin.

SUSIE (V.O.)
Spas T. Raikin, a leading member of

an anti-Communist group.

JIM (V.O.)

And Marina?	Does she have a problem
getting out?

SUSIE (V.O.)
None either.	It's bizarre.	It's

next to impossible to get Russian
sweethearts out.	Nor does Lee have
any problem getting a new passport
when he wants to go to Cuba and Russia
in '63.	A man who has defected once

already.	It's crazy.

JIM
Dammit, it doesn't add up!	Ordinary
people get blacklisted for leftist

affiliations!	The State Department
did everything short of dispatching
a destroyer to Minks to insure
Oswald's return.	Only intelligence
people can come and go like that.

FLASHBACK TO a Forth Worth map factory. We see Oswald at work on photo mattes with a Minox spy camera. The camera shows close-ups of maps and then flashes to a hand in the photographic section. We see a close-up of Oswald's head in a photograph - the same headshot that will be superimposed on the Oswald photo - and a razor blade cutting mattes.

SUSIE (V.O.)
The next thing we know he's living

in Dallas/Ft. Worth in October '62
working 6 months at Jaggars-Chiles-
Stovall, a photographic firm that
contracts to make maps for the U.S.
Army... He starts work only days

before the government reveals Russian
 

missiles in Cuba and the crisis
explodes.	Oswald may have had access

to missile site footage obtained by
the U2 planes and works alongside a
young man who'd been in the Army

Security Agency.

JIM
Sort of like Benedict Arnold coming
back to George Washington's cabinet.

SUSIE

Equally incongruous is Oswald becoming
chummy with the White Russian
community of Dallas - all rabid anti-

Communists.

FLASHBACK TO Fort Worth in 1963. In Oswald's cheap apartment, seven White Russians, including George de Mohrenschildt, a distinguished grey-haired man in his late fifties, are visiting Marina and Oswald, bringing old dresses, groceries, and toys and milk for the crying baby, whose cradle is two suitcases.

SUSIE

His closest friend is an oilman named
George de Mohrenschildt who's about
35 years older than Oswald, who's
only 23 and supposedly broke.	De
Mohrenschildt is a member of the

Dallas Petroleum Club, speaks five
languages and was in French Vichy

Intelligence during the War.	Also
rumoured to have been a Nazi
sympathizer and member of the

"Solidarists", an international anti-
Communist organization with many
Eastern Europeans and ex-Nazis, many
of them brought here by the CIA after
the war, many of them involved in

oil and munitions interests in Dallas
and the Southwest.	You figure it.

AL
Where'd you get all this Nazi stuff?

SUSIE

(hands him a file)
Read it.	They called it "Project
Paperclip."

JIM (V.O.)

This is the guy that keeps turning
up in colonial countries and each
time something strange happens.

Coup d'etats, presidents overthrown.
 

He shows up on a "walking tour" of
Guatemala's Cuban invasion camps

just before the Bay of Pigs invasion.
If we don't know he's CIA, let's
circle him very probable - Oswald's

handler.

We see Oswald and de Mohrenschildt talking with the others and a magazine cover with J.F.K. the subject of discussion.

OSWALD
I think he's made some mistakes on

Cuba, but he's doing a pretty good
job.	If he succeeds, in my opinion,
he'll be a great President.	And a

really attractive one too - open
features, great head of hair...

(laughs)

SUSIE (V.O.)

De Mohrenschildt draws a picture of
Oswald as an intellectual, well read,
speaks excellent Russian, a man who
adored J.F.K.

JIM
That's scenery.	Don't get

sidetracked.	This is the man, bottom
line, who nailed Oswald to the Warren
Commission as a potentially violent

man, and linked him to the rifle.

TIME CUT TO Oswald's apartment on a different day in 1963. George de Mohrenschildt points out a Mannlicher-Carcano rifle in the closet, turns to Lee.

GEORGE

So, Lee, what are you taking a potshot
at this week - rabbits or fascists?

Lee's look is sickly.	He freezes up.

RESUME scene of White Russian gathering in Oswald's apartment.

SUSIE

The only Russian that suspects Oswald
of still being a Communist is Anna

Meller.	But her Russian friend tells
her "he's checked" with the local
FBI and was told Oswald is all right.

Anna Meller, one of the guests, glances at a copy of Das Kapital in a pile of books, and talks to another Russian man about it... Talking now to Lee and Marina are Janet and Bill Williams, a mid-American couple in their late twenties, freshly minted.
 

SUSIE

The Oswalds are introduced by George
de Mohrenschildt to Janet and Bill
Williams.	It's through Janet Williams

in October '63 that Lee gets the
warehouse job, right smack on Elm
Street at the Book Depository, which
is owned by another oilman with ties
to defense and military intelligence.

JIM (V.O.)

Presumably so he can now exercise
his intellect stacking school texts
at $1.25 an hour.

We see Oswald and another man in the Texas School Book Depository in 1963. They are hauling and stacking school textbooks - an obviously lower-level job for Oswald after

the map factory. We cut ahead to empty graphics of the sealed off area, the window site, the cafeteria.

SUSIE (V.O.)
All I can find out about the Williams'
is their tax returns are classified

and that Bill Williams, a descendant
of the Cabots of Massachusetts, has
links through his family and United
Fruit to the CIA and does classified
work for Bell Helicopter which

requires a security clearance - so
what is Oswald, a defector, doing

visiting his wife in his house?
Williams has a relationship at Bell
with General Walter Dornberger,

another one of the Nazis we brought
in after the War for our missile
program.	He used slave labor to
build the V-2 Rockets for Hitler
before Bell needed him.

JIM

I wonder about the Williams'.	Just
where did the first description of
Oswald come from at 12:44?	No one

knows.	They claimed it was Brennan's,
but his description came after 1

P.M.	Who called?	Somehow the FBI's
been tapping the Williams' and picks
up a call between Bell Helicopter

and Janet's phone, an unidentified
voice saying "We both know who's
responsible."	Who called?	Why's
the Bureau been tapping them?

We see the interior of the Williams' home in Irving on a day
 

in 1963.

SUSIE (V.O.)
His wife, Janet Williams, studied
Russian in college and her father

worked for the Agency for
International Development, which
works hand in hand with the CIA.
She suddenly becomes Marina's best
friend.	Marina fights often with

Lee about many things - his secrecy,
the lack of money.	She says Lee is
not sexually adequate.	Lee hits her
on several occasions.	Bill Williams'
convenient separation from Janet

allows Janet to invite Marina to
move into her house in Irving.	There

Marina and Lee have a second daughter -
while Lee, now 24, stores his
belongings in Janet's garage and

rents a small room in Dallas under
an alias of "O.H. Lee".

We see Marina and Oswald in bed at night in the Williams' house, in a tender scene. Oswald says goodbye to his child.

TIME CUT TO Oswald living in a boarding house. It is at night, and he sits in his room alone. The housekeeper, Earlene Roberts, heavyset, white, in her 60's, comes in and asks him if he wants to watch some TV with her. He declines.

SUSIE

When he's arrested, Marina buries
him with the public.	Her description
of him is that of a psychotic and

violent man.

FLASHBACK TO Marina on TV, a different person from before.

MARINA

I do not want to believe, but I have
too much facts.. tell me that Lee
shot Kennedy.

JIM (V.O.)

Yeah, after, they take her to Six
Flags Inn in Arlington, prepare her

for the interviews, teach her how
she should answer - and after two
months and 46 interviews, she has a

nervous breakdown.
(flashback)
Oswald was no angel, that's clear,
but who was he?

BACK TO Antoine's Restaurant.
 

BILL

I'm lost, boss.	What are we saying
here?

JIM
We're saying that when Oswald went

to Russia, he was not a real defector,
that he was an intelligence agent on
some kind of mission for our

government and he remained one till
the day he died, that's what we're
saying.

BILL

And therefore because Oswald pulled
the trigger, the intelligence

community murdered their own commander
in chief.	That's what you're saying!

JIM
I'll go you one better!	Maybe Oswald

didn't even pull the trigger, Bill.
The nitrate test indicates he didn't
even fire a rifle on November 22nd.

And on top of that, they didn't even
bother to check if the rifle had
been fired that day.

BILL

He had his palm print on the weapon.

JIM
It went to the goddamn FBI and they
didn't find a goddamn thing.	It

comes back a week later and one guy
in the Dallas police department
suddenly finds a palm print which
for all I know he could've taken off
Oswald at the morgue.	There's no

chain of evidence, Bill.	And what
about the tow guns actually seen in
the Depository?	One an Enfield
photographed by a newsman and the
other a Mauser, described by Deputy

Weitzman... Maybe, just maybe, Lee
Oswald was exactly what he said he

was Bill - "a patsy".	Take it at
face value.	Lou, Susie, I'm going
with my gut here.	He's got an alias

of Hidell to buy the rifle, "O.H.
Lee" to rent the room, right?	What's
in a name, right?	In intelligence,
they're assumed to be fake.	A name
is sort of like a postbox number, a

code - several different people can
 

use the same name, right?	Then why
can't somebody be using Oswald's

name?

We see blank faces around the table.

BILL

But why?

JIM

To frame him, obviously.	You got to
get in your minds how the hell spooks
think, Bill!	They're not ordinary
crooks.

LOU
I never could figure out why this

guy orders a traceable weapon to
that post office box when you can go
into any store in Texas, give a phony

name and walk out with a cheap rifle
which can never be traced.

JIM
Unless he or someone else wants him

to get caught.	Maybe he never ordered
the weapon, Lou.	Somebody else did.
It was picked up at the post office
early morning when Oswald's time
sheet shows him clocked in at his

job.	Lou, come alive.	These things
are not adding up.

BILL
I still have to question what the

legal basis is that supports this,
boss.	Susie's stuff is colorful,
but...

JIM

Let's start making some assumptions
about the man.	Why would he leave a
path as big as Lee Harvey Oswald's?
This is not a thin trail, gentlemen,
it is a very wide one.	Who found

the evidence?	Who set him up?	Lou,
Bill, Susie, I want you to go back

and check all the sightings of Oswald
in Dallas, New Orleans and Mexico in
the summer and fall of '63 - see if

it's the same guy.

AL
Boss, Oswald impersonators?	Sounds
like James Bond now.
 

JIM
Al, you can't tell a mink from a

coonskin unless you see the fur up
close.	Goddamn, Sam!	If we don't
start reading between the lines here!

Y'all gotta start thinking on a
different level - like the CIA does.
We're through the looking glass.
Here white is black and black is
white.

BILL

What do you think, Lou?

LOU

I'm just an investigator, Bill.	I
leave the theories to you lawyers.

BILL
You, Numa?

NUMA

A week ago I would've said this is
nuts, but now ...
(shakes his head)

There's a lot of smoke there, but
there's some fire.

BILL
Now you guys, come on.	You're talking

about the United States Government
here!

JIM
We're talking about a crime, Bill.

No one is above the law.	Reduce it.
A crime was committed.	Let's get to
work.

MEDICAL UNIT - JAIL - DAY(1966)

Jack Ruby, thick fudge of an angry face, flu-ridden, confronts a doctor and two guards in his cell.

RUBY

Christ, what the hell kinda needle
is that?	I just got a cold for

Chrissake.	I don't want any shot!

DOCTOR

Please relax, Mr. Ruby.	This'll
calm you down and clear this up.

RUBY
Doc, I'm telling you, I don't need

any shots.
 

DOCTOR

Mr. Ruby, I don't want to involve
the guards.	It'll just take a few
seconds.

Ruby looks over at the two guards, who eye him. The Doctor gives him the injection.

FLASHBACK TO Ruby's jail cell in 1964. Ruby talks to men with their backs to us. Lawyers and police clutter the cell, making Ruby hyper-nervous. The chief official's white hair and avuncular voice are all we see and hear of him; his back is to us.

RUBY
Then do you understand that I cannot

tell the truth here?	In Dallas.
That there are people here who do
not want me to tell the truth...

who do not want me to have a retrial?

OFFICIAL
Mr. Ruby, I really can't see why you
can't tell us now.

Ruby catches the stern face of Sheriff Bill Decker from the corner of his eye, the Assistant D.A. next to him.

RUBY

When are you going back to Washington,
sir?

OFFICIAL
(looks at watch)

I am going back very shortly after
we finish this hearing - I am going
to have some lunch.

RUBY

Can I make a statement?	If you
request me to go back to Washington
with you right now, that is if you
want to hear further testimony from
me, can you do that?	Can you take

me with you?

OFFICIAL
No, that could not be done, Mr. Ruby.
There are a good many things involved

in that.

RUBY
What are they?

OFFICIAL
 

Well, the public attention it would
attract.	And we have no place for

you there to be safe, we're not law
enforcement officials, and many things
are at stake in this affair, Mr.

Ruby.

RUBY
But if I am eliminated there won't
be any way of knowing.	Consequently

a whole new form of government is
going to take over this country, and
I know I won't live to see you another
time.	My life is in danger here.
Do I sound screwy?

OFFICIAL

Well I don't know what can be done,
Mr. Ruby, because I don't know what
you anticipate we will encounter.

RUBY

Then you don't stand a chance, Mr.
Chief Justice, you have a lost cause.
All I want is a lie detector test,

and you refuse to give it to me.
Because as it stands now - and the
truth serum - how do you pronounce
it - Pentothal - whatever it is.
They will not give it to me, because

I want to tell the truth... And then
I want to leave this world.

The camera pauses on Ruby's face. The men rise and leave in the shadows.

PARKLAND MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - (1967)

Jack Ruby is escorted out of the infirmary, dead of cancer.

BROUSSARD'S RESTAURANT - NEW ORLEANS - (1967)

The puffy, smiling face of Dean Andrews, framed by huge black glasses, talks in a Louisiana hippie argot of the 50's. The restaurant has a fancy French decor, mirrored walls, marble - it serves the cream of Louisiana society.

ANDREWS
Why you keep dancing on my head for,
my man?	We been thicker'n molasses

pie since law school.

JIM
Because you keep conning me, Dean.
I read your testimony to the Warren

Commission and...
 

ANDREWS

There you go.	Grain of salt.	Two
sides to every coin.

JIM
You tell them the day after the

assassination you were called on the
phone by this "Clay Bertrand" and
asked to fly to Dallas and be Lee

Oswald's layer.

ANDREWS
Right.

JIM
Now that's pretty important, Dean.

You also told the FBI when you met
him, he was six foot two.	Then you
tell the Commission he was five foot

eight.	How the hell did the man
shrink like that, Dean?

ANDREWS
They put the heat on, my man, just

like you're doing.	I gave'em anything
that popped into my cabeza.	Truth
is, I never met the dude.

Sudden FLASHBACK to Andrews' office on a day in 1963. Clay Bertrand sits, back to us, talking to Andrews. He has close-cropped white hair. He is the same patrician man we've seen earlier with Oswald on Canal Street and in Banister's office. Andrews is evidently lying.

ANDREWS
I don't know what the cat looks like

and furthermore I don't know where
he's at.	All I know is sometimes he
sends me cases.	So one day he's on

the phone talkin' to me about going
to Dallas and repping Oswald...
(notices a woman, in
present)
Hey, pipe the bimbo in red.	What

ever happened to that little gal you
was dating in the Quarter - from

Opelousas, y'know, elevator didn't
go to the top floor but tits could
smother gumbo with.

Jim, in present, looking briefly - a pretty girl walking in.

JIM
(remembering)

Yeah, she was pretty, all right, but
 

not half as cute as you, Deano.	You
shoulda tried a legitimate line of

business.

ANDREWS

(chuckles)
You can't ever say crime don't pay
in Louisiana, Jim - only not as good
as it used to.	Good chowder, ain't
it?

JIM

When did you first do business with
this Bertrand?

ANDREWS
(bored)

Oh, I first heard these street cats
jiving about him back in '56, '57
when I lived down in the Quarter.

JIM

Street cats?

ANDREWS

Swishes.	They swish, y'know.	Young
fags, you know.	They'd come into my
bureau needing help, no bread, and
I'd say, hey man, I ain't Rockefeller,
who gonna back you up?	These

cornmuffins go to the phone and
dial...

FLASHBACK TO Andrews' office on another day in 1963. We catch a glimpse of a young swish sitting in Andrew's office talking on the phone. Andrews is also on the phone to Bertrand, unseen, on the other end.

ANDREWS
The dude on the other end says...

CLAY BERTRAND

I'm Clay Bertrand.	Whatever they
owe, I guarantee.

ANDREWS
Hey, suits me fine, Daddy Warbucks -

how do I get in touch with you?

CLAY BERTRAND

I'm around.

ANDREWS (V.O.)
And that's how I first heard of Clay
Bertrand.
 

JIM (V.O.)
What was his voice like?

ANDREWS
You knew you weren't talking to some

low life fag, you know.	He had
command of the king's English.

JIM
Did he pay?

ANDREWS

Always - like tits on a pig.	I wish
I had a million of those bimbettes.

JIM
And Oswald?

ANDREWS
(just a slight

hesitation)
Like I told to the Washington boys,
Bertrand called that summer and asked
me to help the kid upgrade his Marine
discharge...

JIM

So you saw Oswald how many times?

ANDREWS

Three, four.	He came in with a few
Cubano swishes one time I remember...

FLASHBACK TO a third day at Andrew's office in 1963. Oswald is in the office with two young boys.

JIM (V.O.)

Recall any names?

ANDREWS

(in present)
Mario, Jose - they wear names like
you and I wear clothes.	Today the
name is Candy, tomorrow it's Butsie.
I wish I could help you, Jim.

JIM

Did you speak to Oswald in Dallas?

ANDREWS

(knee-jerk reaction)
Hell, no!	I told this Bertrand cat
right off, this isn't my scene, man.
I deal with muni court, I'm a hack
in nigger town, that kid needs a hot

dog.
 

JIM

Then how the hell did you get in the
Warren Commission, Dean?	Except
through the phone records in the

Dallas jail?

ANDREWS
(nervous moment)
There were no phone records.

JIM

Of course there weren't. 'Cause they
disappeared.	And yet the Commission
found you, Dean.

ANDREWS

I don't know how they got to me.
Maybe cause I repped him here.	The
Feebees run background checks.	On

my mama's breasts, man, that's all I
got.
(pauses, adjusts)
There wasn't no conspiracy, Jim.	If
there were, why the hell didn't Bobby

Kennedy prosecute it as Attorney
General, he was his brother for
Chrissake.	How the fuck three people
could keep a secret like that, I
don't know.	It was Oswald.	He was

a nut job.	Faggot, y'know, hated
this country.

As Andrews resumes eating his crabmeat Louie with gusto, Jim reaches over and grabs the fork in mid-air.

JIM

Dean, I think we're having a
communication problem.	I know you
know who Clay Bertrand is.	Now stop

eating that damn crabmeat for a minute
and listen.
(gets Dean's attention)
I'm aware of our long friendship,
but I want you to know I'm going to

call you in front of a grand jury.
I took nine judges on, Deano, right

here in New Orleans, and I beat 'em
all.	If you lie to the grand jury
as you've been lying to me, I'm going

to charge you with perjury.	Now, am
I communicating with you?

Andrews puts down the fork, shaken, silent for a moment.

ANDREWS
 

Is this off the record, Daddy-o?
(Jim nods)

In that case, let me sum it up for
you real quick.	If I answer that
question you keep asking me, if I

give you the name of the "Big
Enchilada", y'know, then it's bon
voyage, Deano - I mean like permanent.
I mean like a bullet in my head.
You dig?	Does that help you see my

problem a little better?	You're a
mouse fighting a gorilla.	Kennedy's
dead as that crab meat.	The
government's still breathing.	You
want to line up with a dead man?

At a nearby table, a waiter has just poured brandy on Crepe Suzettes. A blue flame hovers in the air as Jim leans forward across the table, speaking deliberately.

JIM
Read my lips, Deano.	Either you

dance into the Grand Jury with the
real identity of Clay Bertrand or
your fat behind is going to the

slammer.	Do you dig me?

Andrews stands suddenly.

ANDREWS

You're just as crazy as your mama.
Goes to show it's in the genes!	Do

you have any idea what you're getting
into, my man?	You think Jack Ruby
just up and died of cancer in four

weeks after he gets a retrial?	That's
some kinda new cancer - I'd say that's
a "going out of business cancer".
You got the right ta-ta, but the
wrong ho-ho.	The government's gonna

jump all over your head, Jimbo, and
go "cock-a-doodledoo!"

Andrews drops his pink napkin in the crabmeat and waddles out. Jim now feels closer to the truth than ever.

ANGOLA PRISON - LOUISIANA COUNTRYSIDE - (1967)

From the point of view of an approaching car, the prison looms over the swamp, dogs patrolling the wire.

VOICE (V.O.)

District Attorney Garrison to see
Prisoner 5388, Ward Block 237B.

GUARD'S VOICE (V.O.)
 

Send him on in.

PRISON DORMITORY - (1967)

A chief guard walks Jim and Bill into a circus-like atmosphere. In Louisiana the prisoners can wear any outfit they choose, which makes this prison look like Mardi Gras. There are many transvestites.

GUARD

(with evident pride)
...we don't need no gates out there,
sir, we got the "swamp".	Many of
'em gone in there but none come out...
Hey, Willie!

Willie O'Keefe, a handsome, muscled, young chickenhawk with an earring, bandana, colorful clothes, an aura of burned truth in his intense, staring brown eyes and thick country accent, sashays over.

GUARD

You got some company, wants to talk
wid you.	You behave now, boy, y'hear.

TIMECUT TO the prison work area, where Willie talks, leaning against a tree looking out on a mangrove swamp. It's lunch break and other prisoners move in the background, eating, socializing.

JIM
I want to thank you, Mr. O'Keefe,

for this time.

O'KEEFE

Call me Willie.	I ain't got nuthin'
but time, Mr. Garrison.	Minutes,
hours, days, years of'em.	Time just
stands still here like a snake sunnin'
itself in the road...

BILL

Clay Bertrand, Willie?

O'KEEFE

Yeah.	Clay.	I met him sometime in
June of '62 at the Masquerade Bar.

Dave Ferrie took me there, for the
express reason to meet him.

JIM
For sexual purposes?

O'KEEFE
Well... yeah.
 

FLASHBACK TO the Masquerade Bar in the French Quarter. It's nighttime and Ferrie, Bertrand and O'Keefe sit at a back booth. Bertrand, as seen earlier, is an imposing, white-haired patrician man, over six feet tall, heavily defined bones and eyelids, in his late 40's or early 50's.

BILL (V.O.)

Did he pay you for this?

O'KEEFE (V.O.)

Twenty dollars each time.	Hell,
it's no secret.	That's what I'm
here for.

They rise to leave.	Bertrand with a slight limp.

JIM (V.O.)

Anything else unusual about him you'd
be able to describe in a court of
law, Willie?

O'KEEFE (V.O.)

I remember he had some kinda thing
wrong with his left leg.	He limped.
Don't get me wrong, he's not one of

those, you know, limp wrists.	He's
a butch John.	You'd meet him on the
street, you'd never snap.	You could
go fishing with him, play poker with
him, you'd never snap in a million

years.	So one night we were over at
Ferrie's place.	Having a party.

Sometime in the late summer of '63.

FLASHBACK TO Dave Ferrie's apartment on a night in 1963. The place is filled messy bricabrac, including two dozen mouse cages for Ferrie's cancer experiments. Ferrie, Bertrand, O'Keefe, and four Cubans in battle fatigues are laughing and fooling around. Oswald is in a corner cleaning

a .22 rifle with a scope on it. He looks different, unkempt, unshaven. A record player grinds out a speech in Spanish by Castro. Some other people are there as well - it's a beatnik scene: sandals, hanging out, only one woman. Ferrie is taking pictures throughout of the group horsing around, photographing Oswald.

O'KEEFE

...there were about nine or ten
people, Cubans, friends of Dave doing
some stuff in the bush with him.

Place was a mess.	Dave's mind was a
mess,
(laughs)
Y'know he had all those mice cages
around cause he's working on this

cure for cancer... Dave's smart -
 

real smart - speaks five languages,
knows philosophy, medicine, military

history, politics.	He wanted to be
a priest but they defrocked him 'cause
he was queer...

BILL (V.O.)

And that's where you met Oswald for
the first time?

O'KEEFE (V.O.)
Yeah, strange guy.	Dave introduced

him as...

FERRIE

Willie, say hello to Leon Oswald.

O'KEEFE
(over the racket)
How ya doing?

OSWALD

(sullen, to Ferrie)
What the fuck's he doing here?

O'KEEFE
Fuck you, man.

Ferrie separates them. Oswald seems to resent an outsider being there.

FERRIE

(to O'Keefe)
Leon's in a bad mood, don't get
excited, he's all right.

JIM (V.O.)

Would you say this "Leon" was actually
Lee Harvey Oswald?

O'KEEFE
(in present)

Fuck, yes.	Hell, I'm already in
jail.	I got no reason to lie to
you.	I ain't no nigger.

BILL

Go on, Willie.

O'KEEFE

(present merging to
past)
...well the party got crazier and
crazier, one of those, y'know
"beatnik" type things.
 

FERRIE
(to O'Keefe)

We're having a little meeting here.
(indicates the second
player)

That's Castro.	Sounds like Hitler
doesn't he?	Sonofabitch is going to
go.	Real soon.

CUBANS

Muerte a Fidel!	Muerte!

BERTRAND
(irritated at the
noise)

Oh, stop it already!	What are all
these people doing here anyway?	I

can't bear all this infernal noise.

FERRIE

Clara, don't be so sensitive.

BERTRAND
I didn't come here for a pep rally.
Get all this riffraff out of here.

FERRIE

Okay, okay.

TIMECUT TO later that night, when only O'Keefe, Ferrie, Bertrand, Oswald and three Cubans are left.

O'KEEFE (V.O.)
...finally they got out of there and
I found myself alone with Dave and

this Leon, two of the Cubans, and
this guy Bertrand.	Dave pulled out
his clippings which he was always
carrying around.	He'd been obsessed
with Castro and Kennedy for months

and he started in again...

FERRIE
(waving a clipping,
drunk)

Kennedy fucked us in '61, '62, and
he's fuckin' us now!	And that fuckin'

zealot Bobby Kennedy is the fuckee!
The nerve of that little asswipe
closing the camps.	Took all our C-

4!	Took ten thousand rounds, 3,000
pounds of gunpowder, all our weapons.
Next we'll be living in a world where
only the cocksucking Reds will have
all the weapons and we'll be

surrounded.	If we want a free Cuba,
 

we gotta whack out the fucking beard.

CUBAN
That faggot Kennedy won't let us.
Our hands are empty - how can we

kill him?

BERTRAND
(moving with a drink,
walks with a slight

limp)
It's a real problem getting at him.

Castro's got informers on every block.

FERRIE

(pointing to a map of
Cuba on the wall)

Bullshit!	There's all kinds of new
stuff.	I heard about rockets in an
umbrella - they're tested at Fort

Detrick?	I can show you a dozen
poisons.	Stick it in his food, he'll
die in three days, no trace.	We can
put something in his beard, make it
fall out, he'll look fuckin'

ridiculous without his beard.

CUBAN
(drunk)
Why don't we just take care of the

main problem?	Which is that piece
of shit Kennedy.	He's doing all

kinds of deals!	Kissing Khrushchev's
ass.	I wouldn't even call him
President Kennedy.

O'KEEFE (V.O.)

...then the Cubans left and the
bullshitting was going on, Dave was
drunk, really drunk and he starts in

with Kennedy again.

FERRIE
See, what Kennedy done, with him you
should take a knife and stab and

kill the fucker where he is now.	I
mean it.	This is true.	But I tell

you something.	I hope I get a week's
notice.	I'll kill.	Right in the
fuckin' White House.	Somebody's got

to get rid of this fucker.

Oswald looks up, listens quietly.

O'KEEFE

Oh, c'mon, Dave, you're never gonna
 

get that sonofabitch.

FERRIE
No?	It won't be long, mark my words.
That fucker'll get what's coming to

him.	And it can be blamed on Castro.
Then the whole country'll want to
invade Cuba.	All we got to do is
get Kennedy in the open.

Bertrand with his arms around O'Keefe, laughs, tries to change the subject.

BERTRAND
David, David, always some harebrained

scheme or another... Oh?	What do I
see here?	Oooooh, let's have some

more champagne, shall we!

O'KEEFE

(interested in Ferrie's
proposal)
What about the Secret Service, the
cops?

FERRIE
(pacing, hyper)

No problem if it's planned right.
Look how close they got with de
Gaulle.	Eisenhower was always riding

around in an open top.	I know
somebody who actually went up and

touched Eisenhower once.	We need to
have three mechanics at three
different locations.	An office

building with a high-powered rifle.
Triangulation of crossfire is the
key.	You get the diversionary shot
gets the Secret Service looking one
way - Boom!	You get the kill shot.

The crucial thing is one man has to
be sacrificed, then in the commotion
of the crowd the job gets done and
the others fly out of the country to
someplace with no extradition.	I

could do that myself.	I could fly
to Mexico, and then Brazil.

Oswald listens, playing with his rifle. Bertrand suddenly turns cold, flashing a look at Ferrie.

BERTRAND

Why don't we drop this subject...
it's one thing to engage in badinage
with these youngsters, but this sort

of thing could be so easily
 

misunderstood.
(he squeezes Ferrie)

FERRIE
Ouch!

O'KEEFE (V.O.)

I didn't think much about it at the
time.	Just bullshit, y'know,
everybody likes to make themselves

out to be something more than they
are.	Specially in the homosexual
underworld.	But then when they got
him
(merging to the present)

I got real scared, y'know.	Real
scared.	And that's when I got popped.

BACK TO the prison work area. Jim and O'Keefe continue talking.

JIM

Willie, are you willing to repeat
your statements under sodium
pentothal?	Under the supervision of

a doctor?

O'KEEFE
Fuck, yeah!	I told you so.	And you
can tell'em all I told you so.

JIM

You realize the things you're saying,
Willie, are going to be attacked by
a lot of different people.

O'KEEFE

Bring on all the motherfuckers!
Bring their college degrees in here!
I got nuthin' to hide.	They can't

buy me.	You can't buy me.	I don't
even need the parole.	This is about
the truth coming out.	You're a
goddamn liberal, Mr. Garrison, you
don't know shit, cause you never

been fucked in the ass.	Fascism is
here now, Facism is...

JIM
No one's trying to buy you, Willie.

It's important to know why you're
telling us this.

O'KEEFE
(pauses)

You wanna know why?	'Cause that
 

mother fucker Kennedy stole that
fuckin' election, that's why!	Nixon

was gonna be one of the great
Presidents 'til Kennedy wrecked this
fuckin' country.	Got niggers all

over the fuckin' place asking for
their rights, where do you think we
got all this fuckin' crime now, 'cause
Kennedy promised 'em too damned much.
Revolution comin'.	Fascism's coming

back.	I tell ya this - the day that
Communist sumbitch died was a great
day for this country.	I jes' hate
to think they're blaming it on some
silly fuckin' Oswald who didn't know

shit anyway.	People should know why
that sumbitch was killed.	'Cause he

was a Communist.	Put me on the stand,
go ahead, I'll tell the same goddamn
story, I'm proud of it, don't matter

fuck all to me, things don't change.
