As he talks, Jim shares a sickened look with Bill. Whatever truth he may be telling is necessarily compromised by an attitude that could be destroyed in court.

GARRISON HOME - NIGHT(1967)

Jim, Lou, Al, Susie, and Numa sit around the table having an after hours conference. The kids run in and out of the room, playing. Susie is doing the talking, showing new paperwork and photos.

SUSIE
Your hunch was right, boss, but it's

even spookier than we thought.
Starting in September '63 on, two
months before the assassination,
there are sightings of Oswald all
over Dallas, buying ammunition,

getting a telescopic sight fixed,
going to rifle ranges... Early
November, a Dallas downtown Lincoln-
Mercury dealership where he tells
the salesman Albert Bogard...

FLASHBACK TO the Lincoln-Mercury dealership. Oswald is deliberately kept in half or three quarter shots - a mystery figure. He kicks the tires on a used red Mercury Comet, cocky.

"OSWALD"

Let's take it out for a test drive.

The salesman, Bogard, is hesitant.	"Oswald" doesn't look
 

like he's got a dime to his name.

"OSWALD"

(SENSING BOGARD'S HESITANCY)

Hey, I got a lotta money coming in
the next two weeks.

In the next scene we see the car, driven by "Oswald", zooming up the ramp and disappearing onto the freeway.

SUSIE (V.O.)

...despite the fact he has no license
and from what marina says, does not
know how to drive, he hits the curves

like Mario Andretti at the Indy 500.
Bogard later told his boss he drove

"like a madman."

Resume the scene at the dealership.

BOGARD

Three hundred bucks down, Mr. Oswald,
you can drive outta here with it.

"Oswald", unhappy, starts to leave.

"OSWALD"
Who you kidding!	For this heap?
Forget it...	No honest working man

can afford a car anymore in the
goddamn country!	Maybe I'll have to

go back to Russia to buy a car...

SUSIE (V.O.)

... really dumb dialogue like he's
trying to draw attention to himself.
A real moron.	He walks out.	The
salesman remembers him as about 5'7",
but we know from his draft card he

was about 5'11"...

LOU
...several witnesses see him on
several separate days at different

firing ranges.

FLASHBACK TO a Dallas firing range in 1963.

LOU

...one time, November 9, he decides
he needs to practice on the target
of the guy next to him.	Says
something really dumb to the guy,
who says Oswald was a great shot.
 

MAN
Hey, watcha doing, boy... that's my

target.

"OSWALD"

Hey, sorry, buddy.	I just thought
it was that sonofabitch Kennedy,
y'know.	I couldn't help myself.
(laughs)

JIM
(in present)

...about as subtle as a cockroach
crawling across a white rug.

SUSIE
I'll go you one better, Lou.	He

shows up at Silvia Odio's, a Cuban
lady in Dallas working in the anti-
Castro underground - remember that

name, a solid witness.	The two Cubans
introduce him as "Leon Oswald".

FLASHBACK TO the corridor of Silvia Odio's apartment in Dallas
on a night in 1963.	Oswald drags behind two Cubans - one is
"the Bull", heavyset with a scar over his left eye, who we

saw at the Canal Street incident, and the other, "the Indian",

is quiet and cold.	The men ring the doorbell and talk to a
concerned Silvia as Oswald hangs back, watching, in the
shadows.	The men give her intimate information about her

father, who is imprisoned in Cuba.	The men chatter ad lib
in Spanish.

SUSIE
...the Cubans want Silvia, whose

parents are political prisoners in
Cuba, to help them raise money to
assassinate Castro.	Something about
the men bothers her.	She tells them
she doesn't want anything to do with

violence... about 48 hours later one
of the Cubans calls her back...

We see a shot of Silvia on the phone in her apartment intercut with a shot of "the Bull" in a gas station phone booth, on a night in 1963.

THE BULL
(on the phone, in
Spanish)

This guy Leon Oswald's great, he's
kinda nut...	he told us we don't
any guts, us Cubans, cause Kennedy
should've been whacked after the Bay
of Pigs, and some Cubans should've

done that, it's easy to do, he says -
 

you know he's a Marine, an expert
shooter...

Silvia Odio is surprised to hear this information volunteered. "The Bull's" eyes are on "Oswaldo", outside the booth with "the Indian". They're hanging out, talking to a mystery man, an Anglo.

SUSIE
It's like he's giving her information

she doesn't even ask for.	She's
scared, doesn't see them again till
she sees Oswald's picture in the
paper.	But the Warren Commission
says she has bad eyesight because

they have Oswald in Mexico at this
time, trying to get back into Cuba.

The Cubans think he's a double agent
so they won't take him.	The CIA has
a camera outside the Cuban Embassy

and says this is Oswald in Mexico.
(hands over a picture)
You figure it.

Jim looks at the famous photo... the camera closes in on a heavyset man who looks nothing like Oswald. Liz has come back in and overhears.

AL
If this is Oswald, it must be our

third Oswald.

JIM
The interesting thing is the extent
to which the Warren Commission went

to make him a Communist.	They got
almost 150 pages and 130 exhibits of
the report on this Mexico trip and
the picture doesn't even match.	I'm
beginning to think the point of the

Mexican episode was to lay the blame
at Castro's door.	If Oswald, or
someone purporting to be Oswald, had
gotten into Cuba, come back, then
killed the President, the American

public once again would've screamed
for a Cuban invasion...

Susie picks up the famous Life magazine cover shot of Oswald holding a rifle in his backyard.

SUSIE

I even have doubts about this photo,
boss.	It pretty much convicted Oswald
in the public mind.	Well, according

to Captain Fritz, Oswald told him
 

during his interrogation the photo
was fake.

FLASHBACK TO the Dallas Homicide Office in 1963. Oswald is being interrogated by Will Fritz, Dallas Homicide Chief, who shows him the original of the photo from the Williams garage.

OSWALD
That's not me.

FRITZ
It came from Janet William's garage.

OSWALD
Well, I never saw that picture.	It

is my face, but my face has been
super-imposed - the rest of the

picture is not me at all.	I've done
a lot of photographic work, and that
picture was made by someone else.

FRITZ

So who the hell are you?	Alex Hidell
or Oswald?

OSWALD
Well, you're the policeman, you work

it out.

SUSIE

(in the present)
Oswald, who worked for Jaggars-Chiles-

Stovall, did know spy photography
pretty well.	I took this picture to
two experts.	Look at the way the

shadows on the nose fall in a straight
line like it's high noon.	But the
shadow here on the ground reads like
late afternoon or early morning.
It's not the same time.	Also look

at the crop marks across the chin.
It seems like his head is pasted on
somebody else's body implicating him
with this rifle and gun.

We see a blowup of the photo - the shadows, the crop mark.

SUSIE
And of the two newspapers in his
hands, one is Leninist, the other

Trotskyite.	Any genuine Socialist
would know they hate each other's
politics!

FRENCH QUARTER - SAME NIGHT(1967)
 

Broussard walks past a jazz wake leaving the cemetery - black flambeurs carry torches, people sing "When the Saints Go Marching in". Bill is with a local gambler type.

MOBSTER

Clay Bertrand?	Sure I know him.	He
comes around the Quarter.

BILL
Who is he, Joe?	I've been to every

bar, no one wants to talk.

MOBSTER
I told your uncle I never met a lawman
who wasn't a punk.	You too, Bill,

even if you're family.	He's a big
shot businessman.	I seen him on the

TV news a lot with all the other big
shots.	A fag, you know.	Goes by
another name down here.

BILL

(excited)
What's the other name?

MOBSTER
Shaw.	Clay Shaw.

BILL
(stunned)

Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw?	The guy
who used to run the International

Trade Mart?

MOBSTER

Yeah, what's the big mystery?
Everybody down here knows the guy.

BILL
So why does he call himself Bertrand?

MOBSTER

Who gives a shit what he calls
himself?

BACK AT GARRISON'S HOME -(1967)

SUSIE
...now it gets positively spooky.
In January, 1961 - in New Orleans,

at the Bolton Ford Dealership - when
the Oswald we know is in Russia -
there is a man using the name "Oswald"
to buy trucks for the Friends of
Democratic Cuba.	The salesman never

saw him again, but guess who's on
 

the articles of incorporation of the
Friends of Democratic Cuba?	Guy

Banister.
(reactions from the
others)

Banister has someone using the name
"Oswald" to buy the trucks.	Hoover,
at the FBI, writes a memo dated June,
1960, that there could be someone
using Oswald's passport and identity.

JIM

Goddamn!	They put Oswald together
from Day One!	Like some dummy
corporation in the Bahamas - you

just move him around a board.	Sent
him to Russia, in and out, no passport

problems.	You got the word
"microdots" in his notebook, you got
the Minox camera and the electronic

devices they find in his possessions,
the sealed DIZ201 personnel file.
For all we know, there could be a
dozen Oswalds in different cities,
countries - all of them leaving a

trail of incriminating evidence that
could easily be traced to a scapegoat
after the assassination.	Does the
real Oswald know he's been put
together?	Who knows.	It doesn't

matter, does it?	He's a low level
spy, he doesn't know who he really

works for...

(PAUSE)

Let's call it a night.
(to Lou)
Anything new on Ruby?

The staff members, anxious to go home, have all risen... and now sigh.

LOU
Mobbed up all the way.	Tight with
the Dallas cops.	I'm digging, chief.

I just need 10 more men and some
more dollars.

JIM
I know you do, Lou.	I'm doing three

more lectures this month.	You're
all doing an incredible job, Sue,
Al, Numa.	But this is one where if
you don't nail the other guy, you're
dead.

(he pulls a book from
 

the bookcase for Lou)
How did Jack Ruby dies so quick?	Of

what?	Cancer, right?	A history of
Nazi Germany, Lou.	They were studying
viral cancers as a weapon in the

30's.	We learned a lot more than
you think from the Nazis.	Read this.
Our biological warfare lab is in
Fort Detrick, Maryland.	Close to
where the National Cancer Institute

is located.	Think about it.	Think
the unthinkable - question everything.

NUMA
Even my own wife, chief,

(looking at his watch)
Who's wondering where I am?

JIM
(looking at Liz)

Even your own wife, Numa.	Any of
you want to quit, do me a favor...
put us out of our misery.

They all raise their hands as Bill walks in, excited.

BILL

I fould Clay Bertrand.

They all stop, look.

SUSIE

Who?

BILL

Grab your socks and pull... Clay
Bertrand is Clay Shaw...

SUSIE
(stunned)

No!... Shaw!	Director of The Trade
Mart?	This is incredible.

NUMA
Pillar of the community by day, gay

bars at night.

Liz Garrison is the most shaken, as she pours a fresh pot of coffee.

JIM
Can you get some sworn statements?

BILL
That's gonna be tough.	Nobody's

talking.
 

JIM

I think we should have him in for a
little talk.

LIZ
Do you have any evidence against

him, Jim?	Clay Shaw's done so much
for the city with all that restoration
in the Quarter.	He's well connected,

all his friends, the money, people,
be careful, Jim.

JIM
It'll be off the record, honey.

I'll bring him in on a Sunday.	A
quiet little chat between gentlemen.

Liz walks out of the room silent.	There is a tense pause.

GARRISON'S LIVING ROOM - EASTER SUNDAY(1967)

The TV is on to the latest Vietnam Reports - combat footage.

NEWSMAN 10

(announcer)
In heavy fighting in Vietnam today,
seven more American soldiers died
and 23 were wounded.	The body count
for this week now stands at 67

Americans and 626 enemy soldiers
killed in action.

Liz plays with the kids looking for Easter eggs. The dog is barking - it's a scene of commotion. Jim is getting ready to go out.

LIZ
Jim, come on, honey, get down on
your hands and knees and hunt for

Jasper's Easter egg.

JIM
You know I don't like these tribal
rituals, Freckle Face.	I'm

interviewing Clay Shaw this morning.

NEWSMAN 10
(as TV cuts to
President Johnson)

President Johnson, meanwhile at an
informal press conference, said he
regretted that there is no end in
sight to the war in Vietnam, where
500,000 American troops are now

fighting.	"We face more cost, more
 

loss, and more agony."	In his
proposal to raise taxes, Johnson...

LIZ
(surprised)

But Jim, we're going to Antoine's
with the kids - like we do every
year.

JIM

No.	I told you I was going to talk
to Shaw.

LIZ
But why in the Lord's name would you

do it in the middle of Easter Sunday
when you knew we were...

JIM
(annoyed with her

look)
Because when I scheduled it I didn't
realize it was a holiday.	You were
there, why didn't you say something?

LIZ
Look at the calendar, for Christ's

sake.	You said a Sunday, not Easter
Sunday.

JIM
I'm sorry, but it's important.	Clay

Shaw is important.	I'm sorry.

LIZ

You're missing most of your life,
Jim, and you don't even know it.
The kids are missing out too.
(harder)
It's not just you making the sacrifice

here, honey.

JIM
Look, I'll rush and be there by two,
I promise.	Go ahead without me.

As he leaves, the camera holds on Liz.

GARRISON OFFICE - (1967)

Clay Shaw ("Bertrand"), in an elegant white summer suit, is shown in. Indeed, there is a slight limp to his gait which Jim notices right away.

He shares a look with Bill. Susie is also in the room. Shaw's rich bassoon voice drips with dialect. Imperiously
 

smoking a Gaulois, Shaw has about him an air of authority matched only by Jim's.

CLAY SHAW
Mr. Garrison - what can I do for you

on Easter Sunday?

JIM
I'm sorry, Mr. Shaw, to interrupt
this holiday, but I feel this is a

conversation we might better have
out of the everyday bustle in this
office...

SHAW

(sitting)
I'm not sure I understand.

JIM
(bringing some papers

forward)
Well... in an investigation we're
conducting your name has come up a
number of times.

SHAW
I wouldn't imagine where.

JIM
We recently talked to a number of

men who claim to know you.	Are you
acquainted with a David Logan?

SHAW
No.	Never heard of him.

JIM

A Perry Russo?

SHAW

No.

JIM
A Willie O'Keefe?

SHAW
No, I don't believe I know anyone by

that name.

JIM

Mr. O'Keefe told us he met you at
the Masquerade Bar down in the Quarter
and several evenings later you had
him over for dinner at your apartment
on Dauphine Street.	Do you recall

that?
 

FLASHBACK TO Clay's Dauphine Street residence, in the Quarter, at night in 1962. The butler opens the door and O'Keefe is admitted to the townhouse. Shaw appears behind the butler.

SHAW (V.O.)
(in present)

Of course not.	I don't know this
man.	Obviously then, I wouldn't
have him to dinner.	Incidentally, I

do not live in an apartment.	It's
an 1860's house built by Gallier.
I've restored it faithfully.	You
know I am quite an advocate of
restoration.

At Shaw's house, dinner is served at a long table by the black butler. The table is decorated by a sumptuous setting of silver and candelabra.

Shaw uses a bell to summon the butler.

JIM (V.O.)
Perhaps a few more details about the
evening will refresh your memory.

Mr. O'Keefe told us dinner was served
by a uniformed waiter - a colored
man.	He particularly remembers that
you sat at one end and he at the
other - which he found rather unusual

because the table was so long.	Does
that bring back memories of Willie

O'Keefe?

SHAW

(in present)
Not at all.	But on the other hand,
I do have a lovely Chippendale dining
table and I often have a friend over
sitting at one end while I sit at

the other.	That is precisely the
point of a long dining table.	The
splendor of the meal adds to the
enjoyment of it.

JIM
I would imagine a uniformed waiter

helps.

SHAW

It adds a taste of elegance for which
I must confess a weakness for now
and then.	I call him Smedley.	His
real name is Frankie Jenkins - but I
could hardly imagine anything more

uncouth during dinner than my turning
 

toward the kitchen and hollering
"Frankie!" .. Where is this leading

to, Mr. Garrison?

Willie O'Keefe and Clay Shaw leave the dining table.

JIM (V.O.)

After dinner you paid him to have
sex with you.

SHAW (V.O.)
(laughing)

Pffft!	Absolute nonsense.	The
Quarter is filled with vivid
imaginations, my dear Mr. Garrison -

grimy young hoodlums who'll say and
do anything.	As you well know.

JIM (V.O.)
...in the course of that night, Mr.

O'Keefe said a man named David Ferrie
stopped by the house... along with
another young man...

At Shaw's townhouse, we see Ferrie coming in, with another young chicken.

SHAW (V.O.)
Who?

JIM (V.O.)
David Ferrie.

SHAW (V.O.)
No.	I have never known anyone by

that name.	Of course never having
met Mr. O'Keefe I could hardly have
met Mr. Ferrie...

JIM (V.O.)

...and that the four of you partied
early into the morning hours...

We see the four men in drag, smiling for the flash camera, champagne bottles in hand. Ferrie sniffs some poppers, then shoves a popper in Shaw's face.

FERRIE
(to Shaw)
You're mine, Mary.	Go get the fucking

tools out, bitch.	Now!	I want some
ass.

Ferrie forces more poppers on Shaw. The camera movies to Shaw's bedroom, where Ferrie scatters a drawer full of leather tools.
 

FERRIE

(to Shaw)
Come here, bitch.
(Ferrie grabs Shaw by

the hair)
You want this?	The only way you get
this is do what I say.
(Ferrie whacks Shaw)
I'm the man.	Don't ever forget it.

(Shaw begs and whines)
You want it?	You want it?
(Ferrie spits on Shaw)
Fuck you and your rich friends.
You're nothing but a rich whore!

You're my woman!	Get the cat!
(to young man)

Strip!	Now, woman.	I want to see
skin.

BACK TO Garrison's office.

JIM
(in present)
Let me show you his picture.

(he hands Shaw a
general photo of
Ferrie)

SHAW

(in present)
No.	I'm sure I've never met anyone

of such a bizarre appearance.

JIM

Does the name Clay Bertrand mean
anything to you?

SHAW
Clay Bertrand?	Clay Bertrand?	I

believe there was a man with a name
similar to that who worked at the
Chamber of Commerce.	Is that the
man you had in mind?

JIM
No, it was not.	Do you know an

attorney by the name of Dean Andrews?

SHAW

One meets so many attorneys in my
business.	No, I don't believe I
know Dean Andrews.

Jim is getting incredibly irritated.	He feels Shaw is lying.
 

CUT TO Antoine's Restaurant, where Liz and all five kids look at menus.

SNAPPER
I'm hungry!	When're we gonna eat!

LIZ

We're going to start without him and
he'll be here for dessert.	Snapper,
you put that back!

VIRGINIA

I want a Shirley Temple!

SNAPPER

Me, too.

JASPER
(disappointed)
When's Daddy coming, Mama?

LIZ

Soon.	He's real sorry he can't start
with us but he's promised to be here.

BACK TO Garrison's office later that day. Everyone looks tired as the questioning goes on. Shaw sucks on endless Gauloises.

JIM

(handing a photo to
Shaw)

Mr. Shaw, can you identify this man?

SHAW

Naturally.
(he looks up)
Are you claiming, Mr. Garrison, that
Mr. Oswald also had dinner with me?

JIM
(humorless)

Mr. Shaw, did you ever meet Lee Harvey
Oswald?

SHAW
You really have me consorting with a

cast of sordid characters, don't
you, Mr. Garrison.

JIM
Please answer the question.

SHAW
Of course not!	Such a pity, that

assassination.	In fact, I admired
 

President Kennedy.	A man with true
panache, and a wife with impeccable

taste.

Jim shows Shaw a newspaper clipping.

JIM

Mr. Shaw, this is an Italian newspaper
article saying you were a member of
the Board of Centro Mondo Commerciale

in Italy, that this company was a
creature of the CIA for the transfer
of funds in Italy for illegal
political-espionage activities.	It
says that this company was expelled

from Italy for those activities.

SHAW
I'm well aware of this asinine
article.	And I am thinking very

seriously of suing this rag of a
newspaper.

JIM
It says that this company has heavily

Fascist ties to the French secret
army organization that tried to
assassinate de Gaulle in 1960.

SHAW

Nonsense.	What next?

JIM
...and that this company is linked
to the Schlumber tool company here

in Houma, Louisiana - which is where
their arms may have come from to
David Ferrie and his Cubans...

SHAW

Mr. Garrison, you're reaching.	I am
an international businessman.	The
Trade Mart which I founded is
America's commercial pipeline to
Latin America.	I trade everywhere.

I am accused, as are all businessmen,
of all things.	I somehow go about

my business, make money, help society
the best I can and try to promote
free trade in this world.

JIM

Mr. Shaw, have you ever been a
contract agent with the Central
Intelligence Agency?
 

Shaw glares at him.	Silence.

SHAW
(with powerful contempt)
And if I was, Mr. Garrison... do you

think I would be here today... talking
to somebody like you?

JIM
No, people like you don't have to, I

guess - people like you walk between
the raindrops.

SHAW
(rising)

May I go?	Regardless of what you
may think of me, Mr. Garrison, I am

a patriot first and foremost.

JIM

I've spent half my life in the United
States military serving and defending
this great country, Mr. Shaw, and
you're the first person I ever met
who considered it an act of patriotism

to kill his own president.

SHAW
Now just a minute, sir!	You're way
out of line!

Susie and Bill quiet Jim down.

BILL
Come on, chief.

(as he shows Shaw to
the door)
I'm sorry, Mr. Shaw, it's getting
late.	That's all the questions we
have.	Thank you for your honesty

and for coming in today.

SHAW
I enjoyed meeting with you gentlemen,
and you, Miss Cox.	It was most

pleasant.	I wish to extend to each

of you - and to each of your families - my best wishes for a happy Easter.
(he exits.)

JIM
(beat, excited)

"One may smile and smile and be a
villain."	Goddammit!	We got one of
'em!
 

GARRISON'S HOME THAT NIGHT (1967)

Jim walks in, contrite.	Liz is shutting down the house.
Some of the kids are still up.

JASPER
Daddy!	Where have you been?

JIM
(kisses Liz)

Hi, Freckle Face.

LIZ
(seething)
Hi.

JIM

Tough day.

LIZ

My sympathies.

JIM
Liz, I'm really sorry.	The meeting
went much longer than expected.

LIZ

We waited for you... hours, Jim.
You could have telephoned, for God's
sake.	It's Easter!	You promised,

Jim.

JIM
I don't know what to say except I'm
sorry.	I just don't have rabbits on

my mind.

LIZ
I think you care more about John
Kennedy than your family!	All day

long the kids are asking, "Where's
Daddy?"	What am I supposed to tell
your kids, Jim!

JIM

I don't know what to tell them.	How
'bout the truth - I'm doing my job

to make sure they can grow up in a
country where justice won't be an
arcane, vanished idea they read about

in history books, like the dinosaurs
or the lost continent of Atlantis.

LIZ
That sounds dandy, but it doesn't

replace a father and a husband on
 

Easter Day.

JIM
(angry, turns away)
It's going to get worse, honey.

GARRISON'S OFFICE HALLWAY - MORNING(1967)

Jim, is coming down the corridor with Broussard, is confronted by some 20 local journalists and TV crew members. We hear a hubbub of fierce questioning - ad libs but Jim, puzzled, brushes by, seeking refuge in his office. Lou, Al, Numa and Susie are all waiting for him. The regular staff - some 30 people - are looking, wondering. Lou presents him with the front page of the New Orleans States-Item.

LOU

Congratulations, Boss - you're page
one!

We see a close-up of the headline: "D.A. LAUNCHES FULL J.F.K.
DEATH PLOT PROBE - Mysterious Trips Cost Large Sums."

INSIDE GARRISON'S OFFICE

JIM
(striding into his

office reading the
paper)
Goddamn Sam!

LOU

And it ain't pretty
(reading the copy)
..."the AD has spent more than $8,000

on unexplained travel and
investigative expenses since November,
1966.

NUMA

They went to the public records and
got the vouchers we requested for
withdrawals.

SUSIE

Shaw must've gotten them on our tail.

AL
Could be Ferrie, Martin, Andrews,
any of 'em.

BILL

We didn't talk to Ruby 'cause of
them and they're on our asses for a
measly $8,000!
 

Jim, at his desk, finishes reading the article. A huge picture of him is on the front page. He puts down the paper, reaching for a long, gold pen that is part of the desk set.

JIM

They hunted down the news, it's their
business.	Getting angry doesn't
accomplish a damned thing, but this
changes everything.	We either pull
out now or we go through some heavy

flack together.

They look at each other.

JIM

Bear in mind, each of you, this may
affect the rest of your careers,

your lives...
(pause)
...if any of you pull out, I assure

you I will bear no ill feelings
towards that person and will reassign
you to regular duties.

No takers.

JIM

There it is then.	Thank you.	It
means very much to me.	I'm giving
this office $6,000 from my National

Guard savings so we can continue.	I
will make speeches where I can to

pick up additional money.	Some local
businessmen are putting together a
fund for us and...

SHARON

(coming in)
Mr. Garrison, what shall I tell them?
They're piling up outside the door.

They want a statement, the phones
are going crazier than bugs on a
cake.

Everyone waits. Jim stands, repacks his briefcase with papers and reference books and heads for the back door elevator.

JIM
Neither confirm, deny, nor discuss,
Sharon.	Goodbye, ladies, gentlemen,

I'm going home where I can get a
decent day's work done.

LOU IVON'S APARMTENT - NEW ORLEANS -(1967)

Lou drinks a beer in front of the TV news in his small
 

bachelor apartment.	A fan is blowing.

NEWSMAN 11
(editorial)
Mr. Garrison's own silence on the

subject has raised some interesting
questions.	With taxpayer money has
he uncovered some valuable new
evidence or is he merely saving the
information which will gain for him

exposure on a national level?	Mr.
Garrison it seems, should have some
explanation.

The phone rings and Ivon picks it up.

LOU

Yeah?

DAVE FERRIE (V.O.)

(very agitated)
Did your office plant that garbage
in the fucking paper?

LOU

Who is this?

FERRIE (V.O.)
You know damn well who it is.

LOU
Dave?

FERRIE (V.O.)
Yeah, you got it.	Since you're the

only straight shooter in that fuckin'
office, I'd like an answer from you.
Did you plant it?

LOU

Dave, do you think we're out of our
minds?	The whole building's been a
zoo since that broke.	We can't get
a thing done.	Reporters crawling
everywhere.	You think we want that?

We see Ferrie in a phone booth on the street outside his apartment house in the French Quarter. He's a nervous wreck, watching the reporters and TV cameras surrounding his place, waiting for him.

FERRIE

(yelling)
Somebody planted that fucking story!
And somebody tipped off the press

I'm one of Garrison's fucking
 

suspects.	I can't go home.
I'm out on the street.	The maggots

are everywhere!	Do you know what
you've done to me?	It's all over
the national news now.	You know

what you've done to me?

LOU
Calm down, Dave, what?

FERRIE
I'm a dead man!	From here on, believe

me, I'm a dead man.

LOU

What are you talking about, Dave?
You weren't mentioned in the story.

Don't jump to conclusions.

FERRIE

You think your investigation's been
all that secret?	You know, when you
talk to people, they talk to other
people.

LOU
What did they...

FERRIE
You still questioning any Cubans?

LOU

Dave, you know that's where this
road leads.

FERRIE
It leads farther than that.

LOU
Dave, just calm down.	Meet me in

the lobby of the Fontainbleau in 20
minutes.	I'll have a suite reserved
for you under an assumed name.

FERRIE

(unsure)
The Fontainbleau?	20 minutes?

LOU
(hopeful)

Yeah.	Come on, Dave, come on our
side.	I guarantee you the boss'll
protect you...
(there's a long silence
as Ferrie, torn,

agonizes)
 

Dave?

FERRIE
(dreamy)
...give me protection?

LOU

Yeah!	He'd kill for you Dave.	He
likes you.	Your mind.

FERRIE
I got no place to sleep.	I'll meet

you in 20 minutes.

Ferrie hangs up. Pause. At his end, Lou Ivon hangs up, excited.

GARRISON'S HOME - NIGHT(1967)

The phone rings. Liz picks it up. Jim is watching the TV news: Martin Luther King is delivering a speech against the Vietnam War.

KING
(on TV)

President Kennedy said on one
occasion, "Mankind must put an end
to war, or war will put an end to
mankind."	I pray God that America
will hear this before it's too late,

because today we're fighting a war
I'm convinced is one of the most

unjust wars that has ever been fought
in the history of the world.

LIZ
(on the phone

meanwhile, testy)
No, he's not here now.	And he would
not take calls here if he were!	So

please call the office number.	Thank
you.
(hangs up)
Two of them even had the gall to
come to the door this afternoon, one

all the way from England.

JIM
Did they live?

LIZ
It's not funny, Jim, I'm scared.

JIM
Don't be.	Nothing to be scared about,

honey, I been through four years of
 

war - this is nothing.

The phone rings again.

KING

(on TV)
...sending them 8,000 miles away to
guarantee liberties in Southeast
Asia which they have not found in
Southwest Georgia or East Harlem.

So we have been repeatedly faced
with the cruel irony of watching
Negro and white boys on TV screens
as they kill and die for a nation
that has been unable to seat them

together in the same school.

LIZ
I haven't, Jim.

JIM
Nothing is going to happen to you.

I won't let it.

LIZ

Leave us ALONE for God's sake!
(recognizes the voice)
...Oh, it's Lou.

FONTAINBLEAU HOTEL SUITE - THAT NIGHT

Jim and Lou watch as Ferrie paces wildly, speeding.

FERRIE
I'm caught in the middle.	They're

after me.	It's almost over.

LOU
Listen, Dave, why don't we order
some room service, have a bite, relax.

I'll stay as long as you want.

FERRIE
I don't know who to trust anymore.
Yeah, sure I could use a pot of hot

coffee and a few packs of Camels.
You got anything new in the

investigation?

As Lou picks up the phone and orders room service, Jim answers.

JIM
You mean about the Cubans getting
trained north of the lake?
 

FERRIE
(incoherent)

Oh, you got that?	Banister's pet
project.	Getting paid by the
government to work against the

government.	Beautiful.	What a mind
he had, what a guy, Guy.	He had all
those files.

JIM

Who was paying you, Dave?

FERRIE
You think I was a getaway pilot for
the assassination, don't you?

JIM

I don't know.	Were you?
(Dave laughs)
Who you scared of, Dave?

FERRIE

Everybody!	The Agency.	The Mob.
The Cubans.	Yeah, follow the Cubans.
Check them out.	Here, in Dallas,

Miami.	Check out a guy named Eladio
del Valle.	My paymaster when I flew
missions into Cuba - he's somewhere
in Miami.	You're on the right track.

Lou writes it down. Seeing him writing makes Ferrie even more paranoid.

FERRIE
Hold it!	Hold it!	I'm not

cooperating with anyone.	There's a
death warrant for me, don't you get
it?	Wait a minute.	You're not
bugged, are you?

He feels Lou for bugs, but out of a sense of hierarchy, ignores Jim. He checks around the room - the phone, behind paintings, flower vase, light fixtures - as the batty conversation continues:

LOU
Dave, I always play square.	No bugs.

I'd love you to go on the record,
but I"m in no hurry.	Whenever you're
ready.

FERRIE

(checking the room)
I don't have much time.	They don't
even need bugs anymore.	They got

these fuckin' satellite waves.	They
 

put a bug in a friend of mine when
he was born, right up his nostrils,

subcutaneous, between his eyes.	He
was one of those products of a
crossbreading experiment.	A Nazi

rocket scientist father and a Commie
spy mother.	You'd never believe
half the shit the Agency does.
(holding his neck)
I'm so fuckin' tired.	Haven't slept

since that shit article came out.
Why'd you guys have to go and get me
involved with this?

LOU

Did we involve you, Dave, or did
Clay Shaw?

FERRIE
That cocksuckin' faggot!	He's got

me by the balls.

LOU
What do you mean?

FERRIE
Photographs - compromising stuff.

And he'll use 'em.	The Agency plays
for keeps...
(checks the room for

bugs)
I knew Oswald.	He was in my Civil

Air Patrol unit.	I taught him
everything.	A "wanna be," y'know,
nobody really liked him cause he was

a snitch.	I treated him good.	He'd
talk about his kid, y'know, really
wanted her to grow up with a chance,
but... He got a raw deal.	The Agency
fucked him.	Just like they're gonna

fuck me.

JIM
Let me get this straight, now.	Clay
Shaw is blackmailing you?

FERRIE

Fuckin' A.	How do you think the
Agency gets people to do their
bullshit?	Fuck knows what they got

on Oswald!

Room service knocks, and Ferrie jumps and rushes to the bathroom.

FERRIE
 

Who is it?

BELLHOP (V.O.)
Room service.

Jim whispers something and Lou goes to the door, takes the service table without letting the bellhop in. Jim, excited but trying to stay even, continues with Ferrie.

JIM

Was it the same Oswald, Dave, that
was in Dallas, or was it an
impersonator.

FERRIE

Same one.	I didn't know no
impersonator.

FLASHBACK TO Ferrie at the party with Oswald (obscured) per Willie O'Keefe's witness. Jim, in the present, doesn't feel right about it.

JIM
Did you take a good look at the TV
when they had Oswald?

FERRIE

(shrugs, can't be
bothered)
Black, black - just give it to me.

(takes the fresh coffee
from Lou, lights a

Camel)
Shit.	I'm so exhausted.	My neck is
killing me.	I've got cancer.	Had

it for years.	I been working with
mice, y'know, trying to come up with
a cure.

JIM

Dave, can I just ask you this
directly?	Did you ever work for the
CIA?

FERRIE

(laughs)
You make it sound like some remote

fuckin' experience in ancient history.
Man, you never leave the Agency.
Once they got you, you're in for

life.

JIM
And Shaw?

FERRIE
 

Shaw's an "untouchable", man - highest

clearance.	Shaw, Oswald, the Cubans -

all Agency.

JIM

What about Ruby?

FERRIE
Jack?	Jack was a pimp.	A bagman in
Dallas for the Mob.	He used to run

guns to Castro when he was still on
our side.	Check out Jack Youngblood.
Shit - we almost had Castro.	Then
we tried to whack him.	Everybody's
flipping sides all the time.	It's

fun 'n' games, man fun 'n' games.

LOU
What about the mob, Dave?	How do
they figure in this?

FERRIE

They're Agency, too.	Don't you get
it?	CIA and Mafia together.	Trying
to whack out the Beard.	Mutual

interests.	They been doing it for
years.	There's more to this than
you dream.	FBI fucking hates the
CIA.	Navy Intelligence got something
to do with it too.	Check out "Alan

Pope" in Miami.	Jack Youngblood.
Bill Harvey.	Colonel Roselli.	The

shooter, I hear, was a Dallas cop -
the bagman at Ruby's club.	I heard
he shot his own partner.	Got that?

Check out the rich fucks in Dallas.
H.L. Hunt.	He's dirty.	That's all
I know.	But the Agency always runs
the show.	Check out something called
"Mongoose"	Operation Mongoose.

Government, Pentagon stuff, they're
in charge, but who the fuck pulls
whose chain who the fuck knows, fun
'n' games man - check out Southeast
Asia - that's the next big number -

the heroin trail.	"Oh, what a deadly
web we weave when we practice to

deceive."

JIM

Then who killed the President?

FERRIE
Oh man, why don't you stop.	This is
too fuckin' big for you!	Who did

Kennedy?	It's a mystery wrapped in
 

a riddle inside an enigma.	Even the
shooters don't fuckin' know!	Don't

you get it yet?	I can't be talking
like this.	They're gonna kill me.
I'm gonna die!

(he sits down,
cracking, sobbing)
I don't know what happened.	All I
wanted in the world was to be a
Catholic priest - live in a monastery,

study ancient Latin manuscripts,
pray, serve God.	But I had this one
terrible, fatal weakness.	They
defrocked me.	And then I started to
lose everything.

He bows his head, holding it in his hands, and his wig starts to come off in his hands.

FERRIE

Shit!	Forgot to glue this fuckin'
rug today.	You know, at one time I
even had a full head of hair like
everyone else.	And then I lost that.
That fuckin' Clay Shaw.	I hate the

bastard.	All I got left is in his
rotten, bloody hands.	He tipped the
newspapers - I know it.	That's how
the Agency works.	They use people,
chew them up, spit 'em out.	Now

it's my turn.

JIM
(empathetic)
Dave, it's going to be okay.	Just

talk to us on the record and we'll
protect you.	I guarantee it.

There's a long silence. Ferrie, spent, stares at Jim. He's about to crack, but...

FERRIE

They'll get to you, too - they'll
destroy you... They're untouchable,
man...

(then)
I'm so fucking exhausted I can't see

straight.

JIM

Get some rest, Dave, and you'll feel
better in the morning.	We'll talk
then.

FERRIE

Yeah, yeah.	But leave me alone for
 

awhile.	I got to make some calls.

His eyes are going again.	Deals... intrigue - thru the tears.

LOU

Whatever you say, Dave.	I'll be
home.	Okay?

Lou and Jim share a look.
