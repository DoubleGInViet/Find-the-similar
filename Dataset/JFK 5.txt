CORRIDOR OF GARRISON'S OFFICE - A FEW DAYS LATER(1967)

A mob scene. Press from the U.S. and all over the world are filling the corridor. A French reporter tries to get past the receptionist as Numa passes him with a stack of mail. Also in the hall are many individual citizens who have come to give tips and theories. One of them is dressed as Satan in a red jump suit with mask, horns, tail and a pitchfork.

FRENCH REPORTER

(waving credentials)
Paris Match.	We are the largest
magazine in all of France.

SOVIET REPORTER

My name is Bulgarinov.	I am with
Literaturnaya Gazeta of Moscow.

AMERICAN REPORTER
Bill Turner.	Ramparts.

A mailman, black, comes through lugging three sacks of mail.

MAILMAN
Coming through, out of the way.

RECEPTIONIST

You know who killed the President?
Mr. Garrison is busy but his
assistant...

A camera moves by into the interior offices.

MONTAGE OF OFFICE SHOTS:

BILL BROUSSARD'S OFFICE
A man with the demeanor of Julius

Caesar walks into Bill's office.

CAESAR

(raising arm)
Hail!	Et tu, Brutus?

BILL
And you, too, my friend.
 

Bill escorts him out before he gets the chance to sit down, and then heads for Jim's office.

JIM GARRISON'S OFFICE
Numa joins Jim with a stack of new

mail.

NUMA
Love a duck!	It takes twenty minutes
to get into this office these days.

Are we famous or what?

Jim is reading Newsweek, deeply hurt. There are newspapers all over his desk.

JIM
Notorious is more like it.	"Jim

Garrison is right.	There has been a
conspiracy in New Orleans - but it's
a plot of Garrison's own making"...

and this - "one of the D.A.'s
investigators offered an unwilling
witness $3000 if only he would fill
in the facts of the alleged meeting
to plot the death of the President"...

How can they write that?	Where did
they come up with this? ...
(sorting through others)
"A charlatan," "power-mad," a "hulking
D.A."

(New York Post)
"Morbid Frolic in New Orleans."

Bill has come in during this, completely frazzled.

BILL
The crazies have taken over the

asylum!	It's a zoo out there.

NUMA

Sensational garbage sells newspapers,
Jim.	What else is new?	Look at the
thousands of letters you're getting.
That's where the heart of the country
is.

(reads from one)
"Dear Mr. Garrison, God bless you

for having the courage to go after
the murderers of President Kennedy.
Please don't stop till they're behind

bars.	I am a beautician here in
Hannibal, Missouri, and my husband
is a janitor in the local high school.
We have four kids and not an extra
lot of money but we enclose a

contribution to help with your work.
 

We are praying for you.	God bless,
Judith Hardy, Hannibal, Missouri."

Numa pulls a dollar bill from the envelope.

NUMA
That's what it's about, boss.	For

every lousy article in the press
there's a hundred of these.

Jim is moved.	Bill is not.

BILL
That's fine, Numa, but what about
all the people who aren't writing

letters.	They're sitting home reading
all these lies.	I just heard NBC

crew's in town to do a "White Paper" -
not on the Kennedy killing, but on
us.	One of their top guys, Harry

Stoner, is talking to everybody he
can find about you, boss...

JIM
Oh Jesus, Stoner!... Why doesn't he

call me?

NUMA
(to Bill)
What do you want to do, Bill - fold

up and close the store?	You sound
like it.

BILL
Look, this is bigger than all of us.

We can't try a case in this
atmosphere.

Sharon has come in during this, signalling to Jim.

SHARON
Mr. Miller's been waiting.

JIM
(remembering)

Oh!	Send him in.
(to Numa)

Denver oilman wants to support the
investigation.
(specifically to Bill)

Bill, I know what you're thinking,
but sometimes when it makes no sense
that's exactly when you just gotta
stick to it, head down.

Sharon shows in Mr. Miller, the Denver oilman.	He's a self-
 

assured, impressive man in his 50's with a western accent, cowboy boots and hat, and a well-cut gabardine suit.

JIM
Welcome, Mr. Miller.	Jim Garrison.

Would you care for some coffee?

MILLER
Yes, thank you, Mr. Garrison.	Your
coffee's almost Turkish down here

but I could get used to it.

Numa leaves. Bill indicates he'd like to sit in. Jim nods okay. Miller pays no attention to Bill.

MILLER
I'm glad you could find time to see

me.	I flew down from Denver this
morning on my private jet.

JIM
Yes, your letter indicated you were

in he oil business up there.

MILLER

I've done quite well in Denver, Mr.
Garrison, but I have to admire someone
like you - and I have the means to
back up what I say.

JIM
We can use all the support we can

get.	I think these might interest
you.

Jim has gathered together a group of photos of the shooting.
Sharon bringing the coffee.

JIM
They've been enlarged and show a lot

of detail...

MILLER
Splendid, love to see them.

He glances at the photo but continues on across the room, looking at the pictures on the walls.

MILLER
Where were you?	Europe, Pacific?

JIM

Germany.

MILLER

You were lucky.	I spent three years
 

in the Pacific.
(he looks out the

blinds at Tulane
Avenue)
I've never seen an avenue with such

a	profusion of bail-bonding companies. Why is that?

JIM
(nettled by Miller's

moving around)
I imagine because this is the Criminal
District Court Building
(showing a photo)
This is an enlargement of a potential

shooter standing behind the picket
fence.	We...

We see a blurry blowup of something behind the picket fence.
Miller takes the photo, glances at it and sits down.

MILLER

I know about that shot.	A terrible
tragedy.
(Puts the photo back

on the desk)
How much do you have for carrying on
your investigation?

JIM

If you must know, virtually nothing.

MILLER
How many men are working with you on
this?

JIM

Less than you would guess.	Most
days two to three assistant D.A.'s.
A handful of police investigators.

MILLER

That's all you've had all this time?

JIM

That's it.

Jim expectant of some help.	A pause.	Then:

MILLER

I admire you, Mr. Garrison.	How did
you manage to make your way into Guy
Banister's operation?

The clock is ticking. Jim shares a look with Bill. The cards are on the table.
 

JIM

That was never in he newspapers, Mr.
Miller.

Miller smiles, stands, paces the room. He continues to ignore Bill completely.

MILLER
I'm going to be very frank with you.

You've done a great job, an astounding
job considering the limited resources
available to you.	But the best you
can ever hope for is to stir up a
lot of confusion.	You're not going

to do this country any good, and
you're not going to do yourself any

good.
(he sits back down
and looks directly

at Jim)
You don't belong here.	On this Mickey
Mouse street with that cheap strip
of bail bond shops.

JIM
The job manages to keep me pretty

busy.

MILLER

Nonsense.	You should be in a job
where you can make decisions that

have impact, affect the world.	Here
you're trying to climb up the steep
side of Mount Everest.

He leans forward across Jim's desk, tapping his manicured index finger on the desk. Clearly visible to Jim and to us (in a close-up) is Miller's Annapolis ring tapping.

MILLER
I propose you accept an appointment

to the bench in Federal District
Court and move into a job worthy of
your talent.

(he leans back and
pauses)

Do you have any idea, do you have
any conception of how easily such an
appointment can be arranged?

JIM

And what would I have to do?

MILLER

Stop your investigation... it was a
 

magnificent effort but it's over and
done with.	The press is already on

your behind and that's only the
beginning, my boy, only the beginning.

JIM
How long do you think it would take

me to be appointed?

Jim's eyes go to Bill. He could be wrong, but it's almost as if Bill were going along with the idea now.

MILLER
(smiling, thinking
Jim is hooked)

Well, ordinarily these things take a
long time.	But in your case, with

your record it can be expedited -
easily.	I guarantee it.

Jim leans back, puts his feet up on the corner of the desk, waving them like fans. Bill waits.

JIM
Who are you, Mr. Miller?

(no answer - just the
sound of the overhead
fan)
You see that helmet over there?
(the Nazi helmet with

a bullet hole on his
desk)

I picked that up at the Dachau
concentration camp when we liberated
it in 1945.	It was the most

horrifying sight I've ever seen, Mr.
Miller.	Pyramids of decaying,
stinking bones and skin one on top
of the other.	I don't enjoy looking
at that swastika every day, Mr.

Miller, but I keep it there to remind
me of what can happen when a country
turns from free democratic principles
to Fascism, when a few madmen turn
human beings into digits and millions

sit in silence and do nothing about
it.

Miller waits.	Bill waits.	Jim comes forward with his reply.

JIM
Mr. Miller, you and I have met under

a great misunderstanding.	I haven't
the remotest interest in becoming a
Federal Judge.	And nothing is going

to keep me from going ahead with my
 

investigation of John Kennedy's
murder.

Miller's entire demeanor tightens into a corkscrew of anger and danger.

JIM

Bill, Mr. Miller and I have finished
our conversation.	Would you show
him out?

Bill has a strange reaction - a sudden exhalation of breath as if an entire house of cards were collapsing. He rises, but Miller goes first, leaving silently. Once he's gone, Bill turns wearily to Jim.

JIM

Those bastards!	That's proof enough
right there of what we're up against.
The whole goddamn Federal Government,

Bill!

BILL
Well, they offered you the carrot,
and you turned it down... you know

what's coming next, don't you, boss?

GARRISON'S CONFERENCE ROOM - ANOTHER DAY(1967)

The staff is assembled. We see the headline in the Times-Picayune, which says: "FERRIE CALLS GARRISON PROBE A WITCH
HUNT."

LOU
Boss, I tell you something or somebody

is putting tremendous heat on David
Ferrie.	If we sit on our behinds
any longer, I don't think the guy's
going to hold on.

SUSIE
(raps the newspaper)

Look at this bullshit!	He keeps
changing what he says.	We can't
possibly call him to a Grand Jury.

JIM

Susie, watch the language, would you
please.

AL
My instinct is that Ferrie is going

to keep on deteriorating, and we'll
end up getting more out of him when
he finally cracks.	If we call him

now, he might freeze up and we could
 

lose the best shot we've ever had.

LOU
You don't get it, guys - he can't go
down any further.	We got to protect

him full time.

JIM
(rises, looks at his
watch)

I have a plane to catch... going to
Washington.	An interesting lead,
says he's closely connected to these
events, but he won't come down here...
I know what you're going through

with Ferrie, Lou.	We'll talk
tomorrow.

LOU
I'm onto Ferrie's Cuban paymaster,

Eladio del Valle, in Miami.	I gotta
get him in, boss.	I need more men -
I can't even pull the teams to watch
Ferrie... This is our case!

Numa rushes in with a young investigator, Williams - displaying a miniature microphone.

NUMA
HOLD IT, CHIEF...

JIM

(to Lou)
You just need some sleep, Lou.	It
won't look so bad when...

Numa makes violent signals to shut up - not to talk - sticking the microphone in front of Jim. Williams searches the walls for the bug. Numa signals everyone outside.

GARRISON'S MAIN OFFICE
The staff comes out into the office

with Him, disturbed.

JIM

What the hell is...

NUMA
Williams found this in your office...
We think the conference room is also

bugged.	And maybe the phones.	The
whole place needs debugging.

The whole staff from the conference room reacts. Jim looks stunned.
 

JIM
I don't believe it!

SUSIE
Bugging the District Attorney's office

of New Orleans!	It's outrageous!

Sharon has been standing there trying to get Lou's attention.

SHARON

It's urgent for you, Mr. Ivon.

Lou goes to the phone.

NUMA

Well, believe what you want, boss,
but we got to be more careful.	All

these new volunteers, any one of
them could be...

JIM
Okay, you handle it, Numa.	I don't

have time for this nonsense.
(to the hidden mikes
loudly)

We've obviously got the bastards
worried now.	I'm going to Washington.

Everyone laughs, but the camera goes to the look of shock on Lou's face as he holds the receiver. They all look over at him; feeling the bad news before they hear it.

LOU
Dave Ferrie's dead.	The body was
found at his apartment two hours

ago.

Jim's look says "There goes the case."

OUTSIDE FERRIE'S APARTMENT - FRENCH QUARTER(1967)

Jim and his staff storm into the area, which is cordoned off by police.

Members of the press are all over, yelling questions at Jim.

JIM

(to chief police
officer)
This case is in our jurisdiction.	I

don't want anyone from a Federal
agency in here without an explicit
Federal court order.	You got that,
Hank?
(Hank looks at him

weirdly)
 

NEWSMAN 10

Was Ferrie murdered, Mr. Garrison?
Do you have any leads?

INSIDE FERRIE'S APARTMENT

The apartment is filthy and sinister.	Hundreds of mice squeal
in their cages, upset by the invasion of men and light.
Nothing seems to have been washed in years.	There is an

accumulation of furniture, college pennants, photos of young

boys in training, books everywhere, ammunition, guns, a piano,

maps, fake college degrees on the walls.	Ferrie's naked
body lies on the couch with a sheet over it.	He is unwigged,
his eyebrows unpainted, false teeth next to him.	Jim studies

the corpse as the coroner comes alongside.

JIM
What's it look like, Nick?

CORONER
I don't see any violence, Jim.	Heart

attack, maybe an aneurysm.	Looks
like natural causes.

Jim picks several empty, capless medicine bottles on a table next to the sofa and looks at them. Lou and Bill come over with a typed suicide note.

BILL

It's addressed to no one and no
signature.	"To leave this life is,

for me, a sweet prospect.	I find
nothing in it that is desirable and
on the other hand, everything that

is loathsome."

LOU
Pretty flowery for Dave Ferrie.

The words from the note hang there weirdly, as Jim paces on into the apartment, one of them medicine bottles in his hand. The music grows, and a sinister feel of danger and death pervades the atmosphere. Then the sounds drop away.

FERRIE'S BEDROOM
Jim hands Lou the medicine bottle.

LOU
Proloid?

JIM

I took it once for a low thyroid
condition...
(he walks away)

It raises the metabolism, Lou.
 

(pause)
Did David Ferrie strike you as the

kind of person who had a low
metabolism?

LOU
I'd say the opposite - hypertension.

CLOSET IN FERRIE'S APARTMENT

Jim runs an eye through Dave's closet, cluttered with shabby jackets.

His eye falls on a neat but faded lace and satin, some sort of garment of priestly origin, he takes it in his hand.

JIM

Ferrie was the only one to express
some kind of remorse about this whole
thing.	I think it got him killed.

Susie Cox walks in, a new message written on her face.

SUSIE
Boss, we just got bad news from Miami.

They found Ferrie's Cuban friend -
Eladio del Valle - this morning,
hacked to death with a machete in
his car.	He was tortured, shot in
the heart at point-blank range and

his skull was split open with an
axe...

LOU
Jesus - if that ain't the Devil's

piss!	Those bastards!

Jim's mood darkens, and he heads back into the living room as Ferrie's corpse is being trundled out the door. The sickness is everywhere; an oppressive mood. Bill comes up.

BILL

Found another note, same thing, no
name, no signature.	"When you receive
this, I will be quite dead, so no

answer will be possible.	I offered
you love.	All I got in return in

the end was a kick in the teeth."

JIM

Jesus, they must've been hard pressed
to come up with that one.

Jim, feeling ill, wanting to leave, stops the coroner before he exits...
 

JIM
(gives the coroner

the empty bottle)
Nick, what would happen if a man
suffering from hypertension were to

take an entire bottle of Proloid?

CORONER
He'd die pretty quick, either a heart
storm or a ruptured blood vessel in

the brain.

JIM
Can you ascertain if there's Proloid
in his system?

CORONER

Not in a routine autopsy, but if we
looked at the spinal fluid, there
might be a high level of iodine, but

it's difficult to know.	Whatcha
thinkin', Jim?

JIM
Well, it doesn't make sense, Nick -

he was afraid of dying, then he kills
himself in a way that leaves no trace,
but he leaves two unsigned suicide
notes.

CORONER
(shrugs, skeptical)

If it's a suicide, I seen weirder,
Jim.
(exits)

BILL

The fact is he's gone, chief, and
so's our case.

LOU
Not unless we go for Shaw now.

BILL

With whose testimony? Willie O'Keefe? A male prostitute. Jack Martini? A drunk? Vernon Bundy? A dope fiend. Shaw's got respect, the newspaper editors, the American Bar Association - they're not...

SUSIE

I'm afraid I'm with Bill on this
one.	We haven't got the goods yet.

LOU
 

We wait, Shaw's gonna get whacked.
Oswald, Ruby, Ferrie, del Valle,

Banister, Bowers...	how many corpses
you lawyers gotta see to figure out
what's going on?

JIM

All right, all right.	Break it up.

BILL

Where you going, boss?

JIM
I don't know, Bill, I just don't
know.

OUTSIDE FERRIE'S APARTMENT THAT SAME NIGHT

As Jim, questioned by reporters, gets in his car and leaves, Bill waves goodbye to Lou and walks toward his own car, dejected. The area is cordoned off and humming with activity. Frank, an FBI man who knows Bill from previous cases, approaches him out of the crowd. He wears a hat, suit, and tie.

FRANK
Bill.

BILL
Hey, where y'at, Frank?	You're

wasting your time here.	Big Jim
gave strict orders.	No FBI allowed.

FRANK
It's you I want to talk to, Bill.

BILL

(laughs)
Boss would fry me in hog fat if he
knew...

(motions to car)

FRANK
(getting in the car)
Your boss got a serious problem,

Bill.	Real serious.	We know what's
been going on at your office

BILL
(smiles)

Yeah, I guess you do.

FRANK
You've got nothin', Bill.	I'm talking
as a friend now.	You're riding on

the Titanic.	Time to jump off before
 

you get destroyed along with Garrison.

BILL
Frank, I don't want to hear it.

FRANK
Senator Long set your boss up, my

friend.

This gets Bill's attention.

FRANK

Who do you think fed him that
information?	Garrison's going down.
We're talking your career here, Bill,

your life.	You're a young guy... we
know you're working that Castro thing.

BILL
No, I'm not...

FRANK

Yes, you are.	Look we know Oswald
didn't pull that trigger.	Castro
did.	But if that comes out, there's

gonna be a war, boy - millions of
people are gonna die.	That's a hell
of a lot more important than Jim
Garrison.
(suddenly)

Goddammit, look at me when I talk to
you!	You're too goddamn self-

opinionated, now shut up.	If you
got a brain in that thick skull of
yours, listen to me.	Listen real

hard.

Bill, taken aback, listens.

WASHINGTON D.C. - PARK(1967)

Jim walks down from the Lincoln Memorial, where he is met unobtrusively by a military man in his 50's in casual clothing, hat on his head, an erect posture. They walk towards the Mall, with the Capitol building looming in the background.

X
Jim Garrison?

JIM
Yes.

X
(shakes hands)

I'm glad you came.	I'm sorry about
 

the precautions.

JIM
Well, I just hope it was worth my
while, Mr...

The man doesn't answer. Jim, after his meeting with Miller and loss of Ferrie, is testy and suspicious.

X

I could give you a false name, but I
won't.	Just call me X.

JIM
I've already been warned by the

Agency, Mr. Whoever.	If this is
another type of threat, I don't...

X
I'm not with the Agency, Mr. Garrison,

and I assume if you've come this
far, what I have to say interests
you.	But I'm not going to name names,
or tell you who or what I represent.
Except to say - you're close, you're

closer than you think...

Something about his manner speaks of authority, knowledge, and above all, old-fashioned honesty - the eyes looking at you straight on. He indicates a bench.

X

Everything I'm going to tell you is
classified top secret...
(significant look)

I was a soldier, Mr. Garrison.	Two
wars.	I was one of those secret
guys in the Pentagon that supplies
the military hardware - the planes,
bullets, rifles - for what we call

"black operations" - "black ops",
assassinations, coup d'etats, rigging
elections, propoganda, psych warfare
and so forth.	World War II - Rumania,
Greece, Yugoslavia, I helped take

the Nazi intelligence apparatus out
to help us fight the Communists.

Italy '48 stealing elections, France
'49 breaking strikes - we overthrew
Quirino in the Philippines, Arbenz

in Guatemala, Mossadegh in Iran.
Vietnam in '54, Indonesia '58, Tibet
'59 we got the Dalai Lama out - we
were good, very good.	Then we got
into the Cuban thing.	Not so good.

Set up all the bases for the invasion
 

supposed to take place in October
'62.	Khrushchev sent the missiles

to resist the invasion, Kennedy
refused to invade and we were standing
out there with our dicks in the wind.

Lot of pissed-off people, Mr.
Garrison, you understand?	I'll come
to that later... I spent much of
September '63 working on the Kennedy
plan for getting all U.S.	personnel

out of Vietnam by the end of '65.
This plan was one of the strongest
and most important papers issued
from the Kennedy White House.	Our
first 1,000 troops were ordered home

for Christmas.	Tensions were high.
In November '63, one week after the

murder of Vietnamese President Diem
in Saigon, and two weeks before the
assassination of our President...

FLASHBACK TO the Pentagon offices in 1963. X strides down a busy hall and into the offices of one of his superiors, Major General Y, a lean, cold warrior, battlefield handsome, civilian clothes, and several advisors. There's a U.S. flag on the wall. The status of Y is only clear by the sing on the desk, the name blocked by a passing figure.

X
...a strange thing happened.	I was

sent by my superior officer, call
him Y, to the South Pole as the

military escort for a group of
international VIP's.	This trip had
nothing to do with my nine years of

work in Special Operations.	It was
sort of a "paid vacation".

We hear vague ad-lib mutterings on the soundtrack indicating a friendly atmosphere, and we see stock footage of a C-130 transport flying to Antarctica and ice floes on the surface of the sea.

Then, at a New Zealand airport, we see X, in a uniform, at a newsstand reading of Kennedy's assassination. The banner headline of an "Extra" edition of The Christchurch Star screams out "KENNEDY SHOT DEAD."

X
It wasn't until I was on my way back

in New Zealand that I read of the
President's murder.	That was 2 in
the afternoon the next day New Zealand
time, but already the papers had the
entire history of an unknown 24-year-

old man, Oswald - a studio picture,
 

detailed biographical data, Russian
information - and were pretty sure

of the fact he'd killed the President
alone, although it took them four
more hours to charge him with the

murder in Texas.	It felt as if,
well, a cover story was being put
out like we would in a black op.

Back at the Pentagon office, we see X returning and meeting

Y.	The atmosphere is cordial, but Y is slightly different from before - more harried, more nervous. He turns away to light a cigarette, he doesn't want the usual conversation.

X

Anyway, after I came back I asked
myself why was I, the chief of special

ops, selected to travel to the South
Pole at that time to do a job that
any number of others could have done?

One of my routine duties if I had
been in Washington would've been to
arrange for additional security in
Texas.	The Secret Service is
relatively small, and by custom the

military will augment them.	I checked
it out when I got back and sure
enough, I found out someone had told
the 112th Military Intelligence Group
at 4th Army Headquarters at Fort Sam

Houston to "stand down" that day,
over the protests of the unit

Commander, a Colonel Reich...

We see an outdoor shot of the Texas Army Headquarters on a day in 1963. Inside, on the same day, Col. Reich is on the phone, puzzled.

X
Now this is significant, because it

is standard operating procedure,
especially in a known hostile city
like Dallas, to supplement the Secret
Service.	Even if we had not allowed
the bubbletop to be removed from the

limousine, we'd've put at least 100
to 200 agents on the sidewalks,

without question!	There'd already
been several attempts on de Gaulle's
life in France.	Only a month before

in Dallas UN Ambassador Adlai
Stevenson had been spit on and hit.
We'd have arrived days ahead of time,
studied the route, checked all the
buildings...

We never would've allowed all those
 

wide-open empty windows overlooking
Dealey... never...	We would have

had our own snipers covering the
area.	The moment a window went up
they'd have been on the radio.	We

would've been watching the crowds -
packages, rolled up newspapers, a
coat over an arm, never would have
let a man open an umbrella along the
way - Never would've allowed that

limousine to slow down to 10 miles
per hour, much less take that unusual
curve at Houston and Elm.	You would
have felt an Army presence in the
streets that day, but none of this

happened.	It was a violation of the
most basic protection codes we have.

And it is the best indication of a
massive plot in Dallas.	Who could
have best done that?	People in my

business, Mr. Garrison.	People like
my superior officer could've told
Col. Reich, "Look - we have another
unit coming from so and so providing
security.	You'll stand down."	That

day, in fact, there were some
individual Army Intelligence people
in Dallas and I'm still trying to
figure out who and why.	But they
weren't protecting the client.	One

of them, by the way, was caught in
the Book Depository after police

sealed it off.

In Dealey Plaza, 1963, we see an Army intelligence man taking a shot with a Minolta camera.

X
Army Intell had a "Harvey Lee Oswald"
on file, but all those files have

been destroyed.	Many strange things
were happening that day, and Lee
Harvey Oswald had nothing to do with
them.	We had the entire Cabinet on
a trip to the Far East.	We had a

third of a combat division returning
from Germany in the air above the

United States at the time of the
shooting, and at 12:34 P.M., the
entire telephone system went dead in

Washington for a solid hour, and on
the plane back to Washington, word
was radioed from the White House
Situation Room to Lyndon Johnson
that one individual performed the

assassination.	Does that sound like
 

a bunch of coincidences to you, Mr.
Garrison?	Not for one moment.	The

cabinet was out of the country to
get their perception out of the way.
The troops were in the air for

possible riot control.	The phones
didn't work to keep the wrong stories
from spreading if anything went wrong
with the plan.	Nothing was left to
chance.	I bet you there were even

backup teams and cars on the other
side of the underpass in the event
that Kennedy got through wounded.
They would have moved in with vehicles
like they did with de Gaulle.	He

could not be allowed to escape alive.

The camera is on Jim, listening. This information is much greater than he ever envisioned, and he is stunned. X pauses.

X
I never though things were the same

after that.	Vietnam started for
real.	There was an air of, I don't
know, make-believe in the Pentagon

and the CIA.	Those of us who'd been
in secret ops since the beginning
knew the Warren Commission was
fiction, but there was something...
deeper, uglier.	And I knew Allen

Dulles very well.	I briefed him
many a time in his house.	He was

also General Y's benefactor.	But
for the life of me I still can't
figure out why Dulles was appointed

to investigate Kennedy's death.	The
man who had fired him.	I got out in
'64.	I retired from the U.S. Air
Force.

JACKIE KENNEDY
I never realized Kennedy was so

dangerous to the establishment.	Is
that why?

X
(chuckles)

That's the real question, isn't it -
"Why?" - the "how" is just "scenery"
for the suckers...	Oswald, Ruby,

Cuba, Mafia, it keeps people guessing
like a parlor game, but it prevents
them from asking the most important
question - Why?	Why was Kennedy
killed?	Who benefitted?	Who has

the power to cover it up?... You
 

know in '61 right after the Bay of
Pigs - very few people know about

this - I participated in drawing up
National Security Action Memos 55,
56, and 57.	These are crucial

documents, classified top secret,
but basically in them Kennedy
instructs General Lemnitzer, Chairman
of the Joint Chiefs, that from here
on forward...

FLASHBACK TO the Pentagon offices on a day in 1961. A document is moved by hand into Lemnitzer's office where we see a set of hands holding it while it's read. There's a look of surprise on Lemnitzer's face.

X

... the Joint Chiefs of Staff would
be wholly responsible for all covert
paramilitary action in peacetime.

This basically ended the reign of
the CIA - "splintered it", as J.F.K.
promised he would, into a "thousand
pieces", - and now was ordering the
military to help.	This was

unprecedented.	I can't tell you the
shock waves this sent along the
corridors of power in Washington.
This and, of course, firing Allen
Dulles, Richard Bissell, and General

Charles Cabell, all of them sacred
cows of Intell since World War II.

You got some very upset people here.

DOCUMENTARY IMAGES flash on the screen - Allen Dulles, sweet-faced, smiling, at the Warren Commission Hearing and visiting Dealey Plaza; General Charles Cabell and Richard Bissell...

X
Kennedy's directives were never really

implemented, because of bureaucratic
resistance, but one of the results
was that the Cuban operation was
turned over to my department as
"Operation Mongoose", which meant

that people like my superior officer,
General Y, took over the Cuban

personnel that were being trained to
invade Cuba - and the bases like the
training camp at Pontchartrain in

your home state that were closed
down by Kennedy... and that's how
the "black ops" people, people like
General Y, ended up taking the rules
of covert warfare they'd used abroad

and brought'em into this country.
 

Now they had the people, the

equipment, bases and the motivation... check out an old CIA man, Bill Harvey - ran something called "Executive Action", which carried out foreign assassinations. Harvey was also involved with the fake defection program that got Oswald into Russia. Check out the Cabell brothers. Interesting links to this case.

At Arlington Cemetery on the same day, Jim visits the grave of President Kennedy. We see the eternal flame. Jim thinks about what he should do now. The size of it stuns him. He is lost, reeling back to the past in his mind.

DISSOLVE TO DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE of Dachau concentration camp: thousands of bodies are piled and bulldozed... And then back to Jim at Arlington Cemetery reliving it... only the enormity of past evil can prepare him to confront present evil. In a strange way, it reassures him.

X
...don't underestimate the budget
cuts Kennedy called for in March of

'63 either - close to 52 military
installations in 25 states, 21
overseas bases, you're talking big
money.	You know how many helicopters
have been lost in Vietnam?	About

three thousand so far.	Who makes
them?	Bell Helicopter.	Who owns

Bell?	Bell was near bankruptcy when
the First National Bank of Boston
approached the CIA about developing

the helicopter for Indochina usage.
How 'bout the f-111 fighters?	General
Dynamics in Fort Worth.	Who owns
that?	Find out the defense budget
since the war began.	$75 going on a

hundred billion ... $200 billion'll
be spent before it ends.	In 1950 it
was $13 billion.	No war, no money.
Sometimes I think the organizing
principle of any society is for war.

The authority of the state over it's
people resides in it's war powers.

Even Eisenhower - military hero of
WWII - warned us about it: "beware
the military - industrial complex",

he said.	Kennedy wanted to end the
Cold War in his second term.	He
wanted to call of the moon race in
favor of cooperation with the Soviets.
He signed a treaty with the Soviets

to ban nuclear testing, he refused
 

to invade Cuba in '62, and he set
out to withdraw from Vietnam.	But

that all ended on November 22, 1963.

FLASHBACK TO the White House, 1963. Lyndon Johnson is with Henry Cabot Lodge. We see them as shadowy figures from a distance across the wide room, or near a veranda with a porch and plenty of light. Johnson, his back to us, talks in a loud, thick Texas drawl (mostly muted) and signs a document.

X
Only four days after J.F.K. was shot,

Lyndon Johnson signed National
Security Memo 273, which essentially
reversed Kennedy's new withdrawal

policy and gave the green light to
the covert operations against North

Vietnam that provoked the Gulf of
Tonkin incident.	In that document
lay the Vietnam War.

In the park with X, Jim is staggered by all this information.

X ceases walking and looks at Jim.

JIM

I don't... I can't believe it.	They
killed him because he wanted to change
things.	In our time - in our country?

X

(shrugging)
Kings are killed, Mr. Garrison.

Politics is power, nothing more.
But don't believe me.	Don't trust
me.	Do your own work, your own

thinking.

JIM
The size of this is... beyond me.
Testify?

X

No chance in hell, Mr. Garrison.
I'd be arrested and gagged, declared
insane and hospitalized... maybe

worse.	You, too.	I can only give
you background, you got to find the

foreground, the little things...
Keep digging.	Y'know you're the
only person to ever bring a trial in

the murder of John Kennedy.	That's
important - it's historic.

JIM
I haven't yet.	I don't have much of

a case.
 

X

(rising to leave)
But you don't have a choice anymore.
You've become a significant threat

to the national security structure.
They would've killed you already,
but you got a lot of light on you.
Instead, they're gonna destroy your
credibility; they already have in

many circles in this town.	You're
some kinda ego-crazed southern
caricature to many folks.	Be honest -
the best chance you got is come up
with a case, something, anything,

make arrests, stir the shitstorm.
You gotta hope to reach a point of

critical mass where other people
will come forward and the government
will crack.	Remember, fundamentally

people are suckers for the truth,
and the truth is on your side, 'bubba.
I hope you get a break...

Jim watches this mystery man walking away. The figure vanishes in the Washington breeze. Flags flap over some distant memorial to some distant history of the Republic. Jim rises, a decision made.

EXTERIOR OF CLAY SHAW'S HOUSE - NEW ORLEANS(1967)

Jim, Lou, Al, Numa and several policemen stand at the door as Clay Shaw comes to it.

LOU

Mr. Shaw, you're under arrest, charged
with conspiracy and entering into an
agreement with other persons for the
specific purpose of committing the
crime of murder of President John F.

Kennedy in violation of...

The voice dropping away as the devastated look on Shaw's face spreads, sickly, undone, his arrogant public composure gone, face now filled with terror, disbelief.

LOU

...we have a warrant to search the
premises.

The policemen take Shaw while the D.A. staff moves into the carriage house past the butler, Frankie Jenkins.

INSIDE SHAW'S HOUSE
In the bedroom, Numa points out to

Jim the hooks screwed into the
 

ceiling.	Al pulls out five whips,
several lengths of chain, a black

hood and matching black cape.	Dried
blood is on one whip.

NUMA
It's either a Mardi Gras outfit, or

we got the Marquis de Sade here,
chief.

JIM
I don't care if he was doing it with

giraffes in the zoo, Numa, it's none
of our business.	Let's keep this
side of it quiet, shall we?

AL

When you're in a war, boss, you use
every weapon you got.

JIM
Not one word.	That's an order.

NEW ORLEANS POLICE STATION

Shaw is being fingerprinted. He seems rattled. Police officers try to get the press under control.

OFFICER
Name?	First, middle, last.

SHAW

Clay Lavergne Shaw.

OFFICER HABIGHORST

Address?

SHAW
1313 Dauphine, New Orleans.

OFFICER HABIGHORST
Ever use any aliases?

SHAW
Clay Bertrand.

Habighorst notes it as routinely as Shaw seems to have said it, without thinking, possibly preoccupied by thoughts of press people pushing in.

OFFICER HABIGHORST
Next of kin?

NEWSMAN 12
Mr. Shaw - What do you have to say?
 

MONTAGE - NEWSREEL MUSIC

We see a shot of the exterior of the Justice Department in 1967.

JUSTICE DEPARTMENT CONFERENCE ROOM

The acting Attorney General speaks to the press.

ATTORNEY GENERAL

Yes, Mr. Shaw was included in our
investigation and there was no
connection found at all between Shaw
and the President's assassin.

GARRISON'S OFFICE - CONFERENCE ROOM(1967)

Jim confronts a packed room.	Bill is with him.

JIM

If Mr. Shaw had no connection to the
assassination, why did the FBI
investigate him?	And why, if they
did, is his name not mentioned once
in the entire 26 volumes of the Warren

Report, even it if is to clear his
name?	I doubt this Attorney General
would qualify for my staff.
