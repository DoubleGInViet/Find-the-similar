We see a shot of the Supreme Court building in Washington, D.C. and then a corridor inside the building. A Chief Justice, looking gray and wise like Earl Warren, moves along the corridor in his black robe delivering his verdict to the press.

CHIEF JUSTICE
No, I don't think so.	Mr. Garrison

has presented absolutely nothing
publicly to contradict our findings.
As yet I have not heard one fact to

refute the Commission determination
that Lee Oswald was the lone killer.

In his own office, Jim responds to Justice Warren.

JIM
I congratulate Mr. Shaw.	Most

witnesses have to wait for trial
before they're allowed to produce
sacred cows like the Chief Justice

of the land as a character witness,
who is of course not under oath and
free from the laws of perjury.

NEWSMAN 13

Mr. Garrison, if what you say is
 

even partly true in this case, you
realize you are damaging the

credibility of our government,
possibly destroying it?

JIM
Let me ask you... is a government

worth preserving when it lies to the
people?	It has become a dangerous
country, sir, when you can't trust

anyone anymore, when you can't tell
the truth.	I say let justice be
done, though the heavens fall.

It doesn't play with the press. They shuffle off, quiet, whispering.

GARRISON'S HOUSE(1967)

Liz and Jim watch, silently devastated, as the NBC "WHITE PAPER" unfolds, attacking Jim. They can do nothing. Liz leaves the room, upset.

HOTEL SUITE - NEW ORLEANS(1967)

Julia Ann Mercer, 28, looks at Jim with sincere eyes. Her husband, a prosperous Republican businessman, watches from the corner. Jim - along with Al - has her testimony in front of him.

JIM
In the sheriff's report, Mrs. Mercer,

it says you were at Dealey Plaza two
hours before the assassination but
that...

MERCER

Yes, it was about 11 in the morning.
I was driving west on Elm Street
toward the Triple Underpass, in a

rented car - a blue Valiant.	I'll
never forget that day.

FLASHBACK TO Dealey Plaza in 1963. It's a normal scene - cars, traffic, people starting to arrive for Kennedy's appearance. We catch a glimpse of Julia Ann Mercer, 23, driving, then stopping traffic.

MERCER
...there was quite a bit of traffic

and I was stopped alongside a green
pickup truck.	It was very noticeable
because it was blocking traffic and
it was parked with two wheels on the
curb.	When I saw the gun, I thought -

the Secret Service is not very secret.
 

She glances over at the man in the driver's seat. It's Jack Ruby, wearing a green jacket. Then she sees a young white man in his mid - 20's, in a gray jacket, brown pants, plaid shirt and wool stocking hat, getting out of the passenger side, going to the rear of the van, opening a tool compartment and removing a package that looks like a rifle wrapped in paper. He walks up the embankment in the direction of the picket fence. Ruby looks over and stares at Julia Ann, who turns away and notices three police officers standing near a motorcycle on the overpass bridge. Her eyes lock with Ruby's a second time and as the traffic moves, she drives on.

MERCER
The next morning, Saturday, I went

to the FBI office and the agents
showed me photographs...

In the Dallas FBI office, Mercer sits at a table looking at photos. Two FBI agents stand near her showing her photos. She shakes her head "no" several times, until they put a shot of Jack Ruby in front of her. She holds it up.

MERCER
I picked out three pictures that

looked generally like the driver of
the truck and then...

MERCER
That's the man.

FBI AGENT

(to Second Agent)
Jack Ruby.

SECOND AGENT
What about these others?	You said

they might be him.

MERCER

They look a little like him.	But
no,
(holding up the Ruby
photo)
I'm sure this is the man.

Back in the present, Jim continues to question Mercer.

JIM
You mean you identified him on

Saturday, the day before Ruby shot
Oswald?

MERCER
That's right.	When I saw him on TV,

I was shocked.	I said to my family,
 

"that was the man I saw in the truck."

JIM
(skeptical)
But you didn't seem nearly so sure

in your statement to the Warren
Commission.

MERCER
That's what bothers me, Mr. Garrison.

You see, they've been altered.	My
statements...

Jim is silent. Mercer picks up the report and finds the pertinent paragraphs:

MERCER

This says "Mercer could not identify
any of the photographs as being
identical with the person she had

observed slouched over the wheel of
a green Ford pickup truck."	That's
not true.	I recognized him and I
told them so... They also said it
was a dark green air conditioning

truck, which it was not.	And here...
(she goes to another
report)
...on the Dallas Sheriff's report.
This is really strange.	See that

notarized signature on the bottom of
each page?	That's not my signature.

And there never was any notary present
during any of my questioning.
(she hands the papers

back to Jim)
I guess that's all...

JIM
Mrs. Mercer, as a former FBI man,

it's difficult to accept this.

MERCER
I know, but Mr. Garrison, the FBI is
just not doing their job.

HUSBAND

I'm a Republican, Mr. Garrison, and
I don't go in for this kind of
government bashing, but I must tell

you something's not right when they
don't even bother to call Julia in
front of the Warren Commission.

JIM

They didn't call a lot of people,
 

Mr. Mercer.	I think it's safe to
say the Warren Report is a work of

fiction.

DALLAS CLUB - NIGHT(1967)

BEVERLY, a woman of ample proportions and a big, cute Texas face, ex-club singer, meets with Jim and Lou Ivon in a nightclub not unlike Ruby's Carousel.

LOU
Beverly, tell Mr. Garrison about the

Carousel club.

BEVERLY (V.O.)

Oh yes, I used to go over there a lot to see Jack and especially my friend Jada who danced there. It was the real swinging spot in town. Everybody came. Businessmen, politicians from Austin, Lyndon Johnson's friends... Dallas was a slow town back then. You chewed toothpicks, played dominos, spit and dated policemen. But Jack's was exciting. There were always cops there. Jack liked 'em around, but he used to throw the drunks out himself, 'cause he was kinda a violent-tempered man... it seemed everybody in those days knew Jack was with the

Mob.	The cops were "bad" back then -

they'd shake you down for the money
in your pocket.	They put a lotta
people in the cemetery, especially

colored people.

LOU
Beverly, what about Lee?

Jada and Beverly sit down at the table with Ferrie, Oswald, and Jack, with Jack doing the buying. It's too loud to hear anything.

BEVERLY (V.O.)

Oh, yeah.	One time I came in, Jack
introduces me to these two guys.	He

said, "Beverly, this is my friend
Lee..." and I didn't catch the other
guy's name.	He was a weird-looking

guy with those funny little eyebrows.
The other guy, Lee, didn't make much
of an impression either.	He wasn't
good-looking or nuthin', he didn't
look like he had any money, and he

was in a bad mood, so I didn't pay
 

him much mind.	Well, I might not
remember a name, but I always remember

a face.	When I saw him tow weeks
later on the television, I screamed,
"Oh, my God - that's him!	That's

Jack's friend!"	I knew right then
it had something to do with the
Mafia... Well, about a week later,
after she told the newspapers she'd
met this guy Lee with Jack, Jada

disappears off the face of the
Earth...

THE CAMERA MOVES IN ON JADA

BEVERLY (V.O.)
Never knew what happened to her till

Herman offered to sell me her
wardrobe.	I said, "but Jada's coming
back," and I remember the way he

smiled... and I knew she was never
coming back.

BACK TO the 1967 scene.

JIM
Will you testify,	Beverly?

BEVERLY
I don't think so, sir.

LOU

I thought when we came here, we had
an agreement.

BEVERLY
I just don't want to become another

statistic like her.	If they can
kill the President, do you think
they're gonna think twice about a

two-bit showgirl like me?

LOU
We could call you in, Beverly.

JIM
I know the pressure you're under,

Beverly.	Don't think I don't.
(as he exits)
I understand.

DISSOLVE TO DEALEY PLAZA(1967)

Our view is from the roof of the building on the extreme south side of the Plaza. J.C. Price, the building engineer, in hat and overalls, points for Jim and Lou.
 

PRICE (V.O.)

...yes, sir, right here on this spot.
The shots came from near that wooden
fence over there, near the overpass.

The camera tightens on the picket fence.

PRICE
I saw a man run from this spot and

go behind the Book Depository - 30
minutes later I gave this information
to the Sheriff.

On the overpass near Dealey Plaza, S.M. Holland, a tan, elderly, leather-faced signal supervisor, points to the picket fence for Jim and Lou. His accent is thick and rural. We saw him before, briefly, when Jim was reading the Warren Report.

HOLLAND
I made it very clear to the Warren

people one of the shots came from
behind that picket fence.	I heard
the report and saw the smoke come

out about 6 or 8 feet above the
ground, right out from under those
trees.	There is no doubt whatsoever
in my mind...

FLASHBACK TO the restaged shooting. The smoke hangs under the trees.

CUT TO Richard Dodd on the overpass. He's a cowboy type with a hat and an even thicker accent than Holland.

DODD

(pointing)
...we, all four of us, all railroad
men, standing here, seen about the

same thing.	The smoke came from
behind the hedge - and a motorcycle
policeman dropped his cycle in the
street and run up the embankment...

FLASHBACK to the motorcycle...

BACK TO 1967. Jim and Lou walk with Dodd and Holland near the picket fence. We feel the emptiness of the area now and see the normal amount of traffic driving by.

HOLLAND

...we came around here to look for
tracks.	It rained that morning and
we found a bunch of cigarette butts.

Someone'd been standing about here...
 

The camera shows the "spot" and Lou sighting.

LOU
This is a good spot, chief, for the

head shot.

Jim looks, reliving the moment.

Later Jim and Lou stand on the south side of Elm Street in Dealey Plaza talking to Jean Hill, an attractive, 30-ish teacher. Her demeanor has a rock-solid Texas back-country conviction to it; she's a woman not easily frightened.

JEAN HILL

I was standing here next to my friend
Mary Mooman, who took the photograph

when he was killed...

We see a flash of the Moorman photograph - a blurry Polaroid with the President in the foreground and the picket fence in background. We will return to this photograph in more detail later.

JEAN HILL

I jumped out in the street and yelled,
"Hey Mr. President, look over here,
we wanna take your picture."	He
looked up and then shots rang out.
Mary fell to the ground right away,

shouting, "Get down, they're shooting,
get down, they're shooting." I knew

it but I was moving to get closer to
him.	The driver had stopped - I
don't know what was wrong with that

driver.	And then, out of the corner
of my eye, I saw this flash of light,
in the bushes and that last shot...
just ripped his head off, I mean,
blood, brains, just blew everything...

FLASHBACK TO the day of the shooting. We hear the sound of shots and see the Grassy Knoll from Jean's point of view.

JEAN HILL

I looked up and saw smoke from the
Knoll.	And everything was frozen -

seemed like people wasn't even
breathing, like you're looking at a
picture - except this one guy.	I

saw this one guy running from the
Book Depository towards the railroad
tracks.	And that was the same man I
saw on TV two days later shooting
Oswald.	That was Jack Ruby.	No

question about it.
 

Blurry image - we're not at all sure what or who or if... but a seed is planted. We see smoke - the same smoke Bowers saw... then Jack Ruby in a brown coat running from the Book Depository toward the railroad tracks. Then we see Jean's view as she runs toward the Knoll along with others. there are yells, shouts, and general confusion.

JEAN HILL
It was him I was chasing up the Grassy

Knoll, thinking our guys had shot
back and maybe we got one of them.
I don't know what I would have done
if I had caught him, but I knew
something terrible had happened and

somebody had to do something.

At the picket fence, we see blurry images of police officers, railroad workers, cigarette butts, buddy footprints, confusion...

*JEAN HILL

I never did catch him.	All I saw in
that parking area were railroad
workers and Dallas' finest.

Two Secret Service types approach her suddenly, and one of them puts an arm on her shoulder.

FIRST AGENT

Secret Service, ma'am.	You're coming
with us.

JEAN HILL
Oh no, I'm not.	I don't know you.

We gotta catch this shooter - don't
you realize?

SECOND AGENT
(grabbing her other

shoulder)
I said you're coming with us.	I
want the pictures in your pocket.

JEAN HILL (V.O.)

...he put a hurt on me but good.

JEAN HILL
I don't have any pictures!	I have
to go back and find my friend Mary.

Lemme alone!

The two agents hustle her away.

FIRST AGENT

Hush!	Just smile and keep walking.
 

Hill, 32 years old that day, is shown into a third floor office of the County Courts Building - which has a view of the assassination area. Other Secret Service agents are there. Some 18 people are detained there.

TIME CUT TO two men interrogating Hill.

JEAN HILL (V.O.)
These new people never identified

themselves.	They musta been watching
the whole thing 'cause they knew
everything Mary and me had been doing
that day.	I guess I wasn't too hard
to find - wearing that red raincoat.

MAN

How many shots you say you heard?

JEAN HILL

Four to six.

MAN
That's impossible.	You heard echoes
...echoes.	We have three bullets

and three shots which came from the
Book Depository and that's all we're
willing to say.

JEAN HILL (V.O.)

...which is strange 'cause this is
less than 20 minutes after the

assassination.

JEAN HILL

No, I saw a guy shooting from over
there.	He was behind that fence.
What are you going to do about it?

MAN

We have that taken care of.	You
only heard three shots and you are
not to talk to anyone about this.
No one, you hear?

JEAN HILL (V.O.)
I was scared.	It was all kinda queer,

but it sure felt like two and two
was coming up three... and then they
took Mary's five snapshots from me,

sent them to Washington, and when
they returned them weeks later, two
of them had the backgrounds
mutilated... The only one we saved
was in Mary's camera.	I didn't want

to go to Washington when the Warren
 

Commission subpoenaed me... so the
lawyer come down here and interviewed

me at Parkland Hospital.

In a Parkland Hospital office in 1964, a lawyer interviews Jean Hill. A female stenographer takes notes.

JEAN HILL
He asked me why I thought I was in
danger and I said:

JEAN HILL

Well if they can kill the President,
they can certainly get me.

LAWYER
That doesn't make sense, Mrs. Hill.

We have the man that killed the
President.

JEAN HILL
No, you don't!

JEAN HILL
He kept trying to get me to change

my story about the shots.	He was
getting hot under the collar, and
telling the woman not to write when
he wanted.

JEAN HILL
Look, do you want the truth, or just

what you want me to say?

LAWYER

I want the truth.

JEAN HILL
The truth is that I heard between
four and six shots.	I'm not going

to lie for you.

LAWYER
...you heard echoes.

JEAN HILL
No.	I had guns all my life.	I used

to go turtle shooting.

LAWYER

I realize you're under a great deal
of stress .. it's clouded your
judgement.

JEAN HILL (V.O.)

So off the record, he starts talking
 

about my family, and even mentioned
my marriage was in trouble like I

didn't know it or something.	He got
angrier and angrier and then:

LAWYER
Look, we can put you in a mental

institution.	We can make you look
crazier'n Marguerite Oswald, and
everybody knows how crazy she is.

JEAN HILL (V.O.)

I knew something was crooked as a
dog's hind leg, 'cause no one who is
just taking a deposition gets that

involved and angry... sure enough,
when I finally read my testimony as

published by the Warren Commission,
it was a fabrication from start to
finish.

JIM

Are you willing to testify, Mrs.
Hill?

Back at the Knoll.

JEAN HILL
(without hesitation)
Damned right I would.	Somebody's

got to tell the truth around here
'cause the Government sure ain't

doing it.

DISSOLVE TO a scene inside the Texas School Book Depository in 1967. Jim and Lou walk the floor and look out the windows. Lou has a Mannlicher-Carcano in his hand with a sight and clip. We see Oswald's supposed view of the limousine as he pulls the trigger. Now, innocuous traffic goes by, but the iris of the camera tightens into a sniper's scope.

LOU

The Zapruder film establishes 3 shots
in 5.6 seconds.	Here.	I'm Oswald.
Time me.

Lou cocks the Mannlicher for the first shot. Jim looks at this watch.

Lou assumes the Oswald pose, crouched at the window aiming out.

JIM
Go!

Lou pulls, quickly recharges the bolt, fires, recycles, fires.
 

LOU

Time?

JIM

Between six and seven seconds.

LOU

The key is the second and third shots
came right on top of each other, and
it takes a minimum 2.3 seconds to
recycle this thing.
(he recycles the bolt
for firing)
The other problem is there was a

tree right there...
(he points)

Blocking the first two shots at the

time they occur in the Zapruder film.

JIM
Didn't Hoover say something about

that?	The leaves had fallen off in
November?

LOU
It was a Texas Live Oak, boss.

(he shakes his head)
It sheds it's leaves the first week
of March.	You try to hit a moving

target at 88 yards through heavy
foliage with this cheap 13-dollar

sucker, the world's worst shoulder
weapon.	No way.	The FBI tried two
sets of tests and not one of their

sharpshooters could match Oswald's
performance.	Not one.	And Oswald
was at best a medium shot.	The scope
was defective on it, too.	I mean
this is the whole essence of the

case to me.	The guy couldn't do the
shooting.	Nobody could.	And they
sold this lemon to the American
public.

JIM
The Zapruder film is the proof they

didn't count on, Lou.	We gotta get
our hands on it.

LOU
That means we gotta subpoena Time-

Life on it.

JIM

(looks out the window)
 

Why not just shoot Kennedy coming up
Houston?	There's plenty of time -

he's out in the open - a frontal
shot?

Jim points the Carcano south, right up Houston Street, following a car that happens to be passing by - a convertible with an unknown woman driving.

LOU

I asked myself the same thing.	Common
sense.	Even if you miss the first
shot, if he accelerates you still
got him for a second shot.	No...
the only reason for waiting to get

him on Elm is you got him in a
triangulated crossfire.	You got him

on a flat low trajectory from the
front at the fence there.

The camera swings to the Grassy Knoll and the picket fence as seen from the sixth floor of the Depository.

LOU
...you put a third team there - in

that building, on a low floor.

The camera swings to the Daltex Building across the street.

LOU

When Kennedy gets to the kill zone,
it's a turkey shoot.

JIM
(aiming)

How many men?

LOU
One shooter.	One spotter on a radio.
Maybe three teams.	I'd say these

were professional riflemen, chief,
serious people.	Hunters...	patient.
It takes skill to kill with a rifle,
that's why there's been no execution
of an executive with one in 200

years... "3-2-1...	green!"
(he taps Jim on the

shoulder)
Or else "Abort!	Abort!"

Jim pulls the dead trigger, reliving the moment through the scope on a passing car.

LOU
Main Street's over there - the

original parade route on the way to
 

the Trade Mart.	Too far right?
Impossible shot.

Jim swings the scope up to confront Main Street. Another car is in his sight. Too far.

LOU

So they changed the route to bring
it this way.

Moving at a normal 25 mph, they knew the motorcade would have to slow to about 10 miles per hour to make this turn. That's where you get him.

The camera swings to the Houston and Main intersection.

JIM

Who do you think changed the parade
route?

LOU
Beats me.	City officials.	Secret

Service.	Dallas police.	They did a
dry run with Chief Curry a few days
before.	But they didn't bother

running through Dealey.	They stopped
right there, said something like,
"and afterwards there's only the
freeway," and went home.

JIM
You know who the mayor was?

LOU
No.

JIM

Earle Cabell.	And guess who his
brother is?

LOU
Who?

JIM
General Charles Cabell.	Deputy

Director of the CIA.	Fired by Kennedy
in '61 because of the Bay of Pigs

fiasco, he moved back to the Pentagon,
called Kennedy a "traitor".	When he
came to New Orleans to address the

Foreign Policy Association, you know
who introduced him?	Our friend Clay
Shaw.

LOU

The Warren Commission call him?
 

JIM

(shaking his head)
His boss was the one on the Warren
Commission who handled all the leads

to the intelligence community.

LOU
Allen Dulles?

JIM
(he nods)

Head of the CIA since '53.	Kennedy
fired them both.	Cabell was his
deputy for nine years.

(sickened)
Talk about the fox investigating the

chicken coop.	Now we'll have to
subpoena them, Lou.

LOU
They're gonna love you, chief.

Lou walks to another window in the empty Book Depository where Oswald supposedly did his dirty deed and looks out over the plaza, with all its ghosts. Jim and Lou are two men - with only two men's power. A terrible aloneness pervades their minds.

JIM

Maybe we should just call it a day,
Lou.	Go home.	While we're still a

little behind.	We got two people
killed, maybe more we never thought
about.

LOU

You never got anyone killed, boss.
Their actions killed them years
before.	If we stopped now, it'd be

even more wrong.

FLASHBACK TO 1963 - the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository - the same place Jim and Lou are now. Jim looks around and sees one shooter and one spotter with a lunchbox radio, in repairman clothes. Jim is watching. Neither of these men is Oswald. We hear the sounds of the motorcade below. The shooter pulls the trigger on the Carcano. A loud frightening sound snaps Jim back to the present.

JIM
(in present)

Subpoena them, Lou - Dulles, the
Cabells, Time-Life... the whole damned
lot of 'em!
 

GARRISON'S OFFICE - 9 MONTHS LATER - 1968

We see another smoke-filled conference of assistants. Paperwork is stacked in the corners almost to the ceiling; there are coffee cups and doughnuts on desks. The disorganization and lack of resources are apparent. The staff working on this project now numbers some eleven people, and there are some new investigators and assistants. We sense that the trial is drawing closer.

AL
The U.S. Attorney in Washington

"declines" to serve our subpoena on
Allen Dulles, Charles Cabell, CIA
Director Richard Helms, or any FBI

agent we named.

JIM
Well, what do you expect from a pig
but a grunt.

AL

Without them, it's going to be near
impossible, chief, to prove Shaw's
connection to the CIA.	We got the

same problem with the governors.
All of them.	Reagan in California
won't give us Brading, Ohio refuses
Orville Townsend, Texas on Arcacha,
and Nebraska on Sandra Moffet.

BILL

What the hell is going on?	Never
before has an extradition request
from this office been refused.

AL

We haven't tried to get Julia Anne
Mercer in?

JIM
No, she could get hurt.	If you

believe what's happening to these
other people.

NUMA
She's the best damn witness we have!

JIM
I just don't want to do it.	What

else?

Numa is opening another stack of letters. The dollar bills keep coming. He points to two giant stacks of mail.

NUMA
 

Hate mail here.	Fan mail here.	The

bad news is the IRS has just requested

an audit on your income from this
office.

JIM
(he snorts)

I expected that two months ago, and
they're wasting their time... The
bad news is the National Guard has

just asked me to resign after 18
years.
(we see his hurt)
Well, maybe that's good news - it
was never as good as combat, but

this is.	Bill, any more on Oswald
and Shaw?

BILL
Yeah.	They were seen together in

Clinton in early September.	The
Civil Rights Movement was running a
voter registration drive.

BILL

...rumor is Shaw, a local boy, was

working on some arms deal to discredit

the civil rights movement.	No one
really knows what they were doing
there, but everyone sure saw 'em.

They stood out like cottonballs.	I
got whites and blacks saw 'em, but

last time I checked there was nothing
illegal with registering to vote.
We still got the Negro junkie, Vernon

Bundy, saw 'em talkin' at the seawall
near Lake Pontchartrain.	But it's
tough, boss - no one wants to talk
about Shaw.	He's...

LOU
(back to present)

You know you keep saying that.

BILL

Keep saying what?

LOU
You're not digging.

JIM
I think Clinton is a breakthrough.

Shaw denies he knows Ferrie or Oswald.
Is that right?	It proves he's a
liar.	Keep on it, Bill.

(a look from Lou)
 

SUSIE

This is interesting - are you ready
for this?	Oswald went to see the
FBI two weeks before the

assassination.	It seems Special
Agent Hosty made three routine visits
to his house, supposedly to keep an
eye on Marina Oswald.

FLASHBACK TO Dallas FBI Office in 1963. Oswald is at the counter addressing the female receptionist.

OSWALD
I want to see Special Agent Hosty.

RECEPTIONIST

I'm sorry, he's not in.	Can someone
else help you?

OSWALD
Can I use a pen?

SUSIE (V.O.)
He left a note.	Hosty told a Dallas

newspaperman it was a warning to him
to stop questioning Marina at their
home when Oswald was not present.
She was not a citizen, so possibly
he was threatening to deport her

back to Russia.

TIMECUT TO FBI James Hosty confronting his agitated superior, FBI Agent Shanklin in one of his cubicles.

SUSIE
But what the note really said no one

knows because his boss Shanklin told
Hosty...

SHANKLIN
(reading the note)

Oswald's dead now.	There's no trial.
Get rid of it.	I don't even want
this in the office.	Get rid of it,

Hosty.
(he gives it back to

Hosty)

SUSIE (V.O.)

Hosty tore it up and flushed it down
the toilet.	Waggoner Carr, the
Attorney	General of Texas, says he
had evidence from the Dallas Sheriff's
office that Oswald had been employed

as an undercover informant for the
 

FBI at a salary of $200 a month,
beginning more than a year before

the murder.

JIM

(in present)
This is just speculation, people,
but what if the note was describing
the assassination attempt on J.F.K.?
(the staff seem

surprised by the
thought)
Come on guys, think - that's the
only reason to destroy it, because
if it was any kind of threat, like

Hosty said, they would've kept it
'cause it makes their case against

the "angry lone nut" stronger!
Remember the New Orleans meeting
with Agent Quigley the day he got

busted?

FLASHBACK TO Oswald, under arrest, meeting with Quigley.

JIM

...there again Quigley destroyed the
notes of the meeting.	I think we
can raise the possibility that Oswald
not only was an informant but that
he may well have been the original

source for the telex we have dated
November 17 warning of the Kennedy

assassination in Dallas on November
22.

Holds up the telex. We see a close-up: "URGENT TO ALL SACS FROM DIRECTOR."

JIM
William Walter, the night clerk on

duty here in the FBI office, gave me
a copy of this.	It went all over
the country.	Nothing was done, and
the motorcade went ahead on schedule -
and this wasn't even mentioned in

the Warren Report!	Read it, Al.

AL (V.O.)
"Threat to assassinate President
Kennedy in Dallas, Texas, November

22-23.	Information received by the
Bureau has determined that a militant
revolutionary group may attempt to
assassinate President Kennedy on his
proposed trip to Dallas, Texas, etc,

etc..."
 

FLASHBACK TO New Orleans FBI office in 1963. Walter, the night clerk, receives the teletype, reads it, and runs it.

JIM (V.O.)

...shortly after the assassination,
Walter says, the telex was removed
from all the files in all cities, as
an obvious embarrassment to the
Bureau.	I believe Oswald was sending

information through Hosty...

FLASHBACK TO a Dallas safe house in 1963. Oswald, Ruby, and several Cubans including the Bull and the Indian are talking.

JIM
I have a hunch that from the get go,

Oswald had infiltrated this group,
probably Cubans or right-wing
extremists.	He was at the Book

Depository that day, told to be there
by their handlers, either to prevent
the assassination or to take part in
it.	They coulda told him anything,
either 1) they were going to close

down the plotters that day, or 2)
they were going to fake an attack on
Kennedy to whip up public opinion
against Russia or Cuba and reverse
his policies - it doesn't really

matter what they told him, 'cause he
was under orders, he was a foot

soldier.

Underneath the voice-over we hear and see Oswald, with a floor plan of the Book Depository, at the center of the group. Jack Ruby, Bull, and the Indian, two or three young Cubans and a young white shooter - the man in the plaid shirt described by Julia Ann Mercer - are also there.

OSWALD
(to the two young

Cubans)
I can get you in and up there.	This
is a shot out the southeast window

of the sixth floor.	That floor will
be unoccupied between noon and one.

BULL
What about the elevator?

OSWALD

I can close it off.	The only access
is a stairwell.

BULL
 

We get them in as an air-conditioning
unit.

RUBY
No.	A floor refurbishing group.

Got the van, the uniforms...

OSWALD
(his back to the screen)
...if we can get the motorcade to

turn from Main onto Houston, that'll
do the trick, 'cause it'll slow down
to make the turn here.	You can't
miss.
(to the two young

Cubans)
He's a dead duck.

Ruby shares a look with Bull unbeknownst to Oswald, and then we see the looks on the faces of Jim's team.

BILL		
I don't buy it, chief	- why would
the FBI cover	it up?	You're	talking
the whole FBI	here.	A telex	that
disappears from every	single	FBI
office in the	country?	

JIM
There's a word - orders.

Back in Garrison's office in 1968.

SUSIE
Or a cover up!	Jesus, Bill, don't

you have enough proof of the FBI's
complicity now?

BILL
(to Susie)

Maybe I have a little more respect
for this country's institutions than
you do, Susie.	You tell me how the
hell you can keep a conspiracy going
between the Mob, the CIA, FBI, and

Army Intelligence and who knows what
else, when you know you can't even

keep a secret in this room between
12 people!	We got leaks everywhere!
We're going to trial here!	What the

hell do we really got?	Oswald, Ruby,
Banister, Ferrie are dead.	Shaw -
maybe he's an agent, I don't know,
but as a covert operator in my book
he's wide open for blackmail 'cause

of his homosexuality.
 

JIM

Shaw's our toehold, Bill.	I don't
know exactly what he is, where he
fits, and I don't care.	I do know

he's lying through his teeth and I'm
not gonna let go of him!

BILL
So for those reasons, you're going

to trial against Clay Shaw, chief?
Well, you're gonna lose!	We should
be investigating all our Mafia leads

here in New Orleans - Carlos Marcello,
Santos Trafficante - I can buy that
a hell of a lot easier than the
Government.	Ruby's all Mob, knows

Oswald, sets him up.	Hoffa -
Trafficante - Marcello, they hire
some guns and they do Kennedy and

maybe the Government doesn't want to
open up a whole can o'worms there
because it used the Mob to get to
Castro.	Y'know, Castro being
assassinated sounds pretty wild to

John Q.	Citizen.	So they close the
book on J.F.K.	It makes sense to
me.

JIM

I don't doubt their involvement,
Bill, but at a low level.	Could the

Mob change the parade route, Bill,
or eliminate the protection for the
President?	Could the Mob send Oswald

to Russia and get him back?	Could
the Mob get the FBI, the CIA, and
the Dallas Police to make a mess of
the investigation?	Could the Mob
appoint the Warren Commission to

cover it up?	Could the Mob wreck
the autopsy?	Could the Mob influence
the national media to go to sleep?
And since when has the Mob used

anything but .38's for hits, up close?

The Mob wouldn't have the guts or
the power for something of this

magnitude.	Assassins need payrolls,
orders, times, schedules.	This was
a military-style ambush from start

to finish... a coup d'etat with Lyndon
Johnson waiting in the wings.

BILL
Oh, now you're saying Lyndon Johnson

was involved?	The President of the
 

United States?

His voice is challenging. There's a pause. The men exchange looks and wait.

JIM
I know this, Bill - Lyndon Johnson

got $1 billion for his Texas friends,
Brown and Root, to dredge Cam Ranh
Bay for the military in Vietnam.

That's just for openers.

BILL
Boss, are you calling the President
a murderer?

JIM

If I'm so far from the truth, why is
the FBI bugging our offices?	Why
are our witnesses being bought off

and murdered?	Why are Federal
agencies blocking our extraditions
and subpoenas when we were never
blocked before?

BILL
Maybe 'cause there's some rogue

element in the Government!

The others in the room groan at the reasoning. Bill feels embittered, cornered.

JIM
With a full-blown conspiracy to cover
it up?	Y'ever read your Shakespeare,

Bill?

BILL
Yeah.

JIM
Julius Caesar:	"Brutus and Cassius,

they too are honorable men."	Who
killed Caesar?	Twenty, twenty-five
Senators.	All it takes is one Judas,

Bill - a few people, on the inside,
Pentagon, CIA...

BILL
(he gets up)

This is Louisiana, chief.	How the
hell do you know who your daddy is?
'Cause your momma told you so...
You're way out there taking a crap
in the wind, boss, and I for one

ain't going along on this one.
 

(he exits)
Jim sighs, saddened.	Bill was one

of his best men.

LOU

Chief, I've had my doubts about Bill
for a long time.	He's fighting
everything.

JIM

We need him back.

AL
Bill wasted a goddamn month trying
to prove that mob boys like Barding

and Jack Ruby played ball in right
field with Hunt Oil.

LOU
I don't trust the guy.

JIM

(standing)
Gentlemen, I will not hear this.	I
value Bill as much as anyone here.

(Lou reacts angrily)
We all need to make room for someone
else's ideas, Lou, especially me.
Maybe Oswald is what everyone says
he is and I'm just plain dumb wrong.

AL

I've seen him copying files, leaving
here late at night.

LOU
I just plain don't trust him anymore.

JIM
(angry)

Maybe you didn't hear what I said.
I will not tolerate this infighting
among the staff, I warn you that...

LOU

(suddenly)

Boss, then I'm afraid I can't continue

working with Bill.

Tension, silence.

JIM

(pause, then quietly)
Are you giving me an ultimatum, Lou?

LOU
 

Well, if that's what you want to
call it.	I didn't ever think it

would come to this.	I guess I am,
boss.

JIM
I will not have any damned ultimatums

put to me, Lou.	I'll accept your
resignation.

LOU
You sure got it.	You're one stubborn

and stupid sonofabitch D.A. and you're
making one hell of a mistake!

He storms out.

SUSIE
Aren't you being a little hard?

JIM
No, I don't think I am, Susie.	Anyone

else?

GARRISON'S LIVING ROOM - (1968)

It's after dinner and toys scattered around the living room.

Snapper is chasing his sister Elizabeth around.	Virginia,

6, runs to the ringing phone in the living room, as her mother and Mattie, stunned, watch the news of Martin Luther King's death on TV.

MATTIE
My God!	My God!	What have they
done!

(angrily)
It's lynchin' time!

VIRGINIA
I'll get it.

(into phone)
Hello.

MALE VOICE
Hello.	Is this Jim Garrison's

daughter?

VIRGINIA
Yes?

MALE VOICE
Virginia or Elizabeth?

VIRGINIA
Virginia.
 

MALE VOICE
Virginia, you're a lucky little girl.

Your daddy has entered you in a beauty
contest.	Would you like to be in a
beauty contest?

VIRGINIA

That sounds fun.

MALE VOICE

I need some information from you
then.	How old are you?

VIRGINIA
Six.

MALE VOICE

And how tall are you?

CUT TO Jim's study, where Jim also watches the news in horror. We see TV images of Martin Luther King on the motel balcony, dead.

NEWSMAN 9
To repeat - 39-year-old Martin Luther

King, who preached non-violence and
won the Nobel Peace Prize, was cut
down earlier today by a sniper's
bullets while standing on the porch
of the Lorraine Motel in Memphis,

Tennessee.	He was surrounded by his
closest aides.	The police say they

have no suspects at this time.	Mr.
King...

Jim, visibly shaken, slams his book down on the desk in frustration.

BACK TO the male voice on the phone.

MALE VOICE
And you get of from school at 3 every

day?

VIRGINIA

Yes.

MALE VOICE
Do you walk home?

VIRGINIA
Uh huh.

Liz comes to the phone, a wary look on her face.

LIZ
 

(taking the phone)
Who are you talking to?

MALE VOICE
Okay, Virginia, that's all I need to

know.	I'll call you again when it's
time for the beauty contest.

LIZ
Who's this?... Hello?... Hello?

After a pause, the man hangs up.

VIRGINIA
(excited)

Mama, I'm going to be in a beauty
contest!

LIZ
What did he ask you?

VIRGINIA

Well, he asked me everything.	He
asked me...
