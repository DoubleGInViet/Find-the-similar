Liz freaks out.	She marches into Jim's study.

LIZ
Did you enter Virginia into a beauty
contest?

JIM

(absorbed in the TV)
What?

LIZ
(hysterical)

A man just called.	He asked her
everything!

Her height, her weight, when she came home from school.

JIM
(distracted)
Honey, some crackpot.	Martin Luther

King was killed in Memphis today!

LIZ
(screaming)
Your daughter's life was just

threatened!

JIM
Just a crank making phone calls.
Happens a dozen times a day at the

office.
 

LIZ

Our home, Jim!	A kidnapper, a
murderer, who knows!

JIM
Only cowards make crank calls,

sweetheart, nothing is going to
happen.

LIZ
How do you know?	How do you even

know what goes on in this house
anymore!	You're too busy making
speeches, stirring up every crazed

Klansman in Louisiana after us!

JIM
Get a hold of yourself.

LIZ
I'm leaving.	I'm taking the kids

and I'm leaving!	I won't stand it
anymore.

The kids, hearing the shouting, come to watch from the door of the study.

JIM
Honey, come on.	The government wants

you to be scared.	They want everybody
to be scared to speak out.	They

count on it.	But there's nothing to
be scared of.

LIZ
You and your government!	What's the

matter with you?	Don't you have any
feelings?	Your daughter!	What kind
of man are you?

Jim controls himself, shoos the kids out, closes the door.

JIM
I'll take them up to my mother's if

it'll make you feel better.	Spend a
week.	I'll change the locks, the

phone lines, I'll even get a
bodyguard, all right?	Elizabeth,
get a hold of yourself.

LIZ

Jim, before this Kennedy thing,
nothing mattered to you in this life
more than your children.	The other

night Jasper tried to show you a
 

drawing.	You didn't even notice he
was there.	He came to me bawling

his little eyes out.	Jim, he's
sensitive - he needs more from you.

JIM
I promise I'll make more time for

Jasper.

LIZ

Is it such a chore?	I don't
understand you.

JIM
Damn it, if I say I'll spend more

time with him, I'll spend more time
with him.	I can't fight you and the

world too, Liz.

LIZ

I'm not fighting you, Jim, I'm just
trying to reach you.	You've changed.

JIM
Of course, I've changed!	My eyes

have opened, and once they're open,
believe me, what used to look normal
seems insane!	And now King.	Don't
you think this has something to do
with that?	Can't you see?

LIZ

(she explodes)
I don't want to see, goddammit!	I'm
tired.	I've had enough!	They say

you don't have anything anyway!
Everybody in town's talking.	You're
ruining this man Shaw's life!	You're

attacking him because he's homosexual!
Going ahead with this stupid "trial"!
Did you ever once stop and consider
what he's going through?

JIM
(astounded)

That's not why I'm attacking him!
You don't believe me - all this time

you never believed me.

LIZ

Oh, I don't know anymore!	I believe
there was a conspiracy, but not the
government.	I just want to raise
our children and live a normal life!
I want my life back!
 

The children press in at the door. Mattie, ignoring them, is enraged as she watches King's eulogy on TV. Riots are already breaking out.

JIM

Well so do I, goddammit!	So do I!
I had a life too, y'know - I had a
life, too.	But you just can't bury
your head in the sand like some
ostrich, goddammit, Elizabeth!	It's

not just about you - and your well-
being and your two cars and your
kitchen and your TV and "I'm jes
fine honey."	While our kids grow up
into a shithole of lies!	Well, I'm

not "fine" about that, I'm angry.
My life is fucked, Liz!	And yours

is, too!	And if you don't want to
support me I can understand that but
don't you go start making threats of

taking the children away.

LIZ
You never talked to me this way
before, Jim Garrison.	I'm not making

any threats.	I'm leaving you.	I'm
taking the kids to my mother's.	I
am - I am.

She runs out, past the stunned kids, sobbing as she goes up the stairs. Jim pursues her like an angry spirit, yelling up the stairs at her.

JIM
Go on then, get out!	Go hide

someplace.	Join the rest of them!
They'll tell you I'm crazy.	You got
plenty of people'll tell you Jim
Garrison's crazy.	You won't have a
problem filing your divorce papers

on me ...somebody's got to try,
goddammit, somebody!

The kids move away, fearful. Quaking with rage and hurt, Jim stands there at the bottom of the stairs, strangled with pain. He takes a law dictionary in his hand and throws it across the room. Jasper and Virginia come over to him.

JASPER
Are we going away, Daddy?

JIM

Well, it looks like it, Jasper.

JASPER

Because of Kennedy?
 

(a beat.	Jim doesn't
answer)

Are the same people gonna kill us,
Daddy?

JIM
No, Jasper, nobody's gonna kill us.

VIRGINIA
Do you love us?

JIM

Yes, of course I do, honey.

VIRGINIA

No.	I mean like mommy loves us.
She really loves us.

JASPER
I'm scared.

JIM

(bending down)
There's nothing wrong with feeling a
little scared, Jasper, Virginia.

Telling the truth can be a scary
thing.	It scared President Kennedy,
but he was a brave man.	If you let
yourself be too scared, then you let
the bad guys take over the country,

don't you - and then everybody gets
scared.

JASPER/VIRGINIA
Stay with Mom, Daddy... please.

JERRY JOHNSON SHOW - (1968)

The band strikes up "When the Saints Go Marching In" introducing Jim, who strides in from the wings to shake hands with Jerry Johnson, the friendly-looking host.

SIDEKICK
And now, Jerry, here's Big Jim
Garrison, District Attorney of New

Orleans, Louisiana.

The audience is enthusiastic. Jim smiles and waves, then sits down next to Johnson.

JOHNSON
Welcome, District Attorney Garrison.

May I call you Jim?

JIM

I've been called everything under
 

the sun, Jerry.	Call me whatever
you like.

He reads from a script on the desk.

JOHNSON
First we had your charge that the

Cuban exiles killed the President,
then the Mob, then you said the oil
billionaires did it, then you said

the Minutemen and the Ku Klux Klan
collaborated to do it, now your latest
theory seems to be that the CIA and
the FBI and the Pentagon and the
White House all combined in some

elaborate conspiracy to kill John
Kennedy.	Let me ask you, is there

anyone besides Lee Harvey Oswald who
you think did not conspire to kill
the President?

He fixes his eyes on Jim, waiting for a reply. A weariness has set in on Jim. Once more into the slaughter.

JIM

How many hours do I have to answer
that one?	Well let's just say this,
Jerry - I've stopped beating my wife.
(the audience laughs)
Or maybe you should ask Lyndon

Johnson.	We know he has some answers.

The audience, loving it, cheers. Johnson looks at Jim blankly, and reads the next question on his list.

JOHNSON
There have been a number of reports

in reputable news media - Time,
Newsweek, our own NBC - that you
have gone way beyond the legal means

available to a prosecutor, that you've
intimidated and drugged witnesses,
bribed them, urged them to commit
perjury.	What is your response?

JIM
Your faith in the veracity of the

major media is touching, Jerry.	It
indicates that the Age of Innocence
is not yet over.	But seriously,

Jerry, people aren't interested in
Jim Garrison - they want the hard
evidence!	They want to know why he
was killed and what forces were
opposed to...
 

JOHNSON
(interrupting)

Some people would say you're paranoid.

JIM

Well, if I am, why is the Government
concealing evidence?

JOHNSON
Are they?	Why would they?

JIM

(pulling out his
briefcase)
That's exactly my question, Jerry.

Maybe I'd better show you some
pictures so you can begin to

understand what I am talking about.

He pulls out a large blowup of the Allen photo of the three hoboes and starts to hold it up in front of the camera.

JIM
These arrests were photographed
minutes after the assassination, and

were never shown to the American
public.	They show...

It takes Johnson a few moments to realize what's happening. When he does, he lunges like a cobra for the photographs, pulling Jim's arm down so the pictures are out of the camera's view.

JOHNSON
(sharply)

Pictures like this don't show up on
television!

JIM
(holding the picture

up again)
Sure they do.	The camera can pick
this up.

JOHNSON

(yanking his arm down)
No, it can't!

Jim swings the picture up a third time, but the stage director gives a "cut" signal - finger across the throat - and the

red light on the camera blinks off. The monitor shows another camera panning the audience.

JIM
(quickly realizes

he's about to be cut
 

off)
Those men you just saw were arrested

in Dallas minutes after the
assassination.	They were never seen
again.	No record of arrest, no

fingerprint, no mugshot, nothing.
They all got away.

The director frantically gives Johnson the "cut" sign.

JOHNSON
We'll be back after these messages.

The audience cheers as the commercial comes on.

GARRISON'S HOME - (1968)

Jim comes home. His wife and two of the children are waiting in the doorway. They kiss. Al Oser interrupts.

AL
Jim, bad news.	Bill's turned, boss.

I think he's given everything we've
got to the Feds.

NUMA
We studied the memos - there was

nothing there, chief, nothing!	When
we went to confront him, the landlady
said that sonofabitch just took off,

left everything.

SUSIE
I'm sorry.

JIM
I know.

LIZ
(to Jim)

I'm sorry.

NUMA
Something sure scared him.

JIM
Bill doesn't scare that easy.

Somebody got to his thinking.	He
was never that good a thinker.

On the TV, the news is on.

NEWSMAN 9
Much is at stake tonight in
California.	Public opinion polls

show Senator Robert Kennedy of New
 

York leading Senator Eugene McCarthy
of Minnesota.	Their anti-Vietnam

War message is obviously striking a
chord with the voters, and whoever
wins tonight will certainly emerge

as the favorite over Vice-President
Humphrey to win the nomination in
Chicago in August.	That man now
seems to be Senator Kennedy.

We see a shot of Robert Kennedy in Los Angeles with his supporters.

NUMA
Sure sounds like he's winning.

JIM

He'll never make it.	If he wins,
they'll kill him.	He wants to avenge
his brother.	He'll stop that war.

No, they'll kill him before they let
him become President.

Liz shares a look with Al and Numa.

AL
Boss, with Broussard they have

everything.	All our witnesses, our
strategy for the trial.	We'd have
to doublecheck all his work, there

could be false leads... we gotta
rethink this trial.

We don't have a choice.

JIM
I don't think so, Al.	You remember

the Hemingway story, "The Old Man
and the Sea"?
(Al nods)

The old fisherman manages to catch
this great fish - a fish so huge he
has to tie it to the side of the
boat to get it back in.	But by the
time he reached shore, the fish had

long since been picked apart by sharks
and nothing was left but the skeleton.

NUMA
Then what are we going through all

this trouble for?

JIM
It's a means to an end.	This war
has two fronts - in the court of

law, we hope, against the odds, to
 

nail Clay Shaw on a conspiracy charge.
In the court of public opinion, it

could take another 25 or 30 years
for the truth to come out, but at
least we're going to strike the first

blow.

LIZ
And if you're wrong?

JIM
(rising)

I never doubted for a second that I
was.
(softly)

Will you come to the trial, Elizabeth?

LIZ
I	don't think so, Jim...

She walks out.

We see the outside of Jim's house and hear crickets chirping - the purr of the suburb. Inside, the TV election results are still on.

NEWSMAN 1

With 53% of the precincts reporting,
Senator Kennedy continues to hold a
lead of 48% to 41% over Senator

McCarthy.	CBS News has projected
Senator Robert Kennedy the winner of

the crucial California primary.

Jim is in the kitchen fixing himself a sandwich. There's a strange feeling in the house. We hear the wind - a shutter sighing. Jim suddenly doesn't feel alone in the kitchen.

ROBERT KENNEDY
(voice over on TV)

...and that is what has been going
on within the United States over the
last three years - the division, the
violence, the disenchantment, whether
it's between blacks and whites,

between poor and the more affluent,
or between age groups or the war in

Vietnam - we can start to work
together.	We are a great country,
an unselfish country and a

compassionate country.	I intend to
make that my basis for running.

He waves and leaves the podium, going back through the kitchen of the hotel. Jim is frozen in his spot, shaken. The ghost of Jack Kennedy - as he was before the killing - stares at
 

him through the kitchen, as if encased in a hologram. The hooded eyes watch Jim without expression. They're communicating, in some strange subliminal way. Suddenly shots ring out from the television and there's pandemonium.

NEWSMAN 1
(shaken)
SENATOR KENNEDY HAS BEEN SHOT!	WE
DO NOT KNOW HOW SERIOUS IT IS YET.
SENATOR KENNEDY HAS BEEN SHOT.

The television shows a scene of confusion. Jim walks out, looking at the TV, struck down with his foreknowledge and his inability to do anything about it.

In their bedroom upstairs that night, Jim gently wakes Liz and holds her.

JIM
They killed him, honey.

LIZ

(groggily)
Huh?

JIM
(strangled)

He won... and they killed Robert
Kennedy.	They shot him down.

LIZ
(realizing, with terror)

Oh no!	No!	I can't believe it.	I
can't believe it.	Both of them,
both brothers, oh my God!

She clings to him, horrified. He caresses her hair. They look in each other's eyes.

LIZ

You're right, it hasn't ended, has
it?

He kisses her gently - They start to make love, numbed, needing each other, needing their love in an increasingly terrifying world.

JIM
(awkward)
I wish I could've loved you more...

I feel sometimes like I didn't ever..
love you or the children enough...
I'm sorry.

OUTSIDE THE COURTS BUILDING - NEW ORLEANS -(JAN. 1969)
 

The scene is like a circus. Armed, uniformed guards with walkie-talkies are everywhere. Guards with rifles are on the rooftop. There are crowds of reporters from around the world and many onlookers. Everyone going into the courtroom is frisked by electronic metal detectors.

INSIDE THE COURTROOM

Jim, accompanied by Mattie, the maid, but not his wife, forges his way through a tightly packed crowd to the prosecution table, joining Al, Susie, Numa, and others from his team. Young law student have come to watch. The crowd is noisy to the point of unruliness. Suddenly there's a hush as everyone cranes their necks to see Clay Shaw and his attorneys, Irvin Dymond and two others, enter the court. Shaw, impeccably dressed, his high handsome cheekbones sucking on an ever-present cigarette in a porcelain filter (smoking in court

was allowed then), smiles to those who greet him as if they were not really there and limps past Jim with a stony indifference.

The clerk starts pounding the gavel to call the court to order as Judge Edward Aloysius Haggerty sweeps in and takes the bench. He's a stocky little Jimmy Cagney look alike with fierce blue eyes under bushy brows. The jurors - nine white men and three black men - all dressed in suits and ties, look on.

CUT TO Willie O'Keefe pointing out Clay Shaw.

O'KEEFE
That's Clay Bertrand.	That's the

man I saw at David Ferrie's.

Irvin Dymond cross-examines O'Keefe.

DYMOND

(words wafting)
That's who you say you saw... a
confessed homosexual, convicted of

solicitation, pandering... a man who
has lied about most everything, who...

TIME CUT TO Vernon Bundy, a poor black man, who points at Shaw.

BUNDY

It was that man there, yessir.	He
was at the Pontchartrain wall with
the man who shot the President.	I

remember him cause o' his limp there.

DYMOND
A heroin addict, injecting himself
at the wall, barely conscious...
 

TIME CUT TO Jim looking over at a strange man, Matthews, a kind of lawyer, making notes and conferring with Shaw and Dymond. Matthews seems to have some authority over both men.

Corrie Collins, a black woman who is one of the CORE workers from Clinton, is on the stand.

COLLINS
(pointing at Shaw)

...that was the man there.	He dropped
Oswald off on the voter line.	I
remember 'cause they were the only
white strangers around that morning.
That big, black Cadillac of his made

me think they might be FBI.

TIME CUT TO the Town Marshall on the stand.

TOWN MARSHALL

(looking at Shaw)
...said he was a representative of
one International Trade Mart in New
Orleans.

DYMOND
...more than five years ago, for two

minutes.	It's fair to say you could
be mistaken, isn't it?

TIME CUT TO Dymond cross-examining Dean Andrews, shaking his head.

ANDREWS
...figment of my imagination... The

cat's stewing me, the oyster's
shucking me I told him, you got the
right at-at but the wrong oh-oh...
Bertrand is not Shaw, scout's honor
and you can tell him I said so...

SUSIE

(counter-arguing)
Objection, your Honor.	This office
has won a conviction of perjury

against Dean Andrews on this matter.

DYMOND
Exception taken.	That case is on
appeal!

Arguments follow.

TIME CUT TO Charles Goldberg, a mild-looking New York accountant, on the stand with Dymond cross-examing.
 

DYMOND
(relishing this)

Mr. Goldberg, you claim you met David
Ferrie and Clay Shaw while on a
vacation here from your accounting

business in New York, you had drinks
and, under the influence discussed
killing Kennedy, is that not so?

GOLDBERG

I did.

DYMOND
Why?

GOLDBERG
Well, I wanted to make sure she's

the same girl I sent.

DYMOND

I see... and why are you experiencing
this paranoia?

GOLDBERG
(launching into his

explanation)
Well, you see, I've been subject to
hypnosis and psychological warfare
ever since 1948, when I was in
Korea...

We see the faces of people in the courtroom... the judge's face... obviously Goldberg is disturbed (or maybe he is telling the truth, but it doesn't play well)... Jim looks at Al sickly.

AL

He was one of Broussard's witnesses,
chief.	I'm sorry.	He was totally
sane when we took his affidavit.

SUSIE

But how does Dymond know what to
ask?	FUCK!	We're dead.

GOLDBERG
When someone tries to get your

attention - catch your eye - that's
a clue right off.

TIME CUT TO Jim calling Officer Habighorst to testify.

GARRISON
Your Honor, I call police officer
Aloysisus Habighorst to the stand.
 

Habighorst, the clean-cut police officer who booked Clay Shaw on the day of his arrest, starts forward.

JUDGE HAGGERTY
I'm going to have to ask the jury to

leave the courtroom.

GARRISON
What?

This is an ugly surprise for Jim. We see him at the bench arguing loudly with the judge. Susie, Dymond and Al are also there.

JUDGE HAGGERTY

I'm sorry, Jim, but the defendant
did not have his lawyer present when

asked.

FLASHBACK TO 1967, in the New Orleans police station. Shaw is being booked. The press is there and Habighorst is questioning him.

HABIGHORST
Any alias?

SHAW

Clay Bertrand.

We see a close-up on Habighorst typing this in.

GARRISON (V.O.)

Jesus, Ed, from time immemorial it's
been standard booking procedure to
ask an alias.	You know that.	There's

no constitutional requirement that
says a lawyer has to be present for
routine questions.

JUDGE HAGGERTY

I call'em as I see'em, Jim.	I'm
ruling it inadmissible.

GARRISON
That's our case!

JUDGE HAGGERTY

If that's your case, you didn't have
a case.	I wouldn't believe whatever
Habighorst said, anyway.

GARRISON

I can't believe you're saying this
in the courtroom.

JUDGE HAGGERTY
 

(feistier)
Well, I am saying it.	Bring in the

jury.

AL

We're filing for a writ to the
appellate court.

JUDGE HAGGERTY
You do that.

Dymond goes back to Shaw, very please.	Shaw smokes, icy.

Jim, devastated, sits, feeling it's over.

CUT TO Clay Shaw on the stand.	Dymond cross-examines him.

DYMOND

...Oswald?

SHAW

No, I did not.

DYMOND
...ever called Dean Andrews?

SHAW
No, I did not.

DYMOND
...and have you ever met David Ferrie?

SHAW

(with a smirk of
amusement)
No, I would not even know what he

looked like except for the pictures
I've been shown.

DYMOND
...did you ever use the alias Clay

Bertrand?

SHAW
No, I did not.

DYMOND
Thank you... Mr. Shaw.

Jim rises slowly out of his chair.

JIM
Well, a very great actor has just

given us a great performance, Your
Honor, but we are nowhere closer to
the truth.	Let it be noted, my office

is charging Clay Shaw with outright
 

perjury on the fifteen answers he
has given, not one word of this...

JUDGE HAGGERTY
You're out of order, Jim Boy, now

sit down.	Strike those remarks!!

CUT TO later in the trial. A movie screen has been installed for the jury. Jim paces dramatically, as if waiting, casting looks at the door. Members of the press pack the hot room, and a fan turns overhead.

JIM
To prove their was a conspiracy
involving Clay Shaw we must prove

there was more than one man involved
in the assassination.	To do that,

we must look at the Zapruder film,
which my office has subpoenaed.	The
American public has not seen that

film because it has been kept locked
in a vault in the Time-Life Building
in New York City for the last five
years.	There is a reason for that.
Watch.

The Zapruder film (8mm) now rolls.	We have seen pieces of

it before in the opening of the film, but now we see it whole. It is crucial that this piece of film be repeated several times during the trial to drive home a point that is easily lost on casual viewing. The first viewing is silent except for the sound of the clanky projector. It lasts about 25 seconds, and then the lights come on. The jury is shaken. The judge is shaken. The people in the courtroom murmur.

Even Clay Shaw is surprised at what he has seen. Jim says nothing, letting the truth of it sink in. Then:

JIM
A picture speaks a thousand words.
Yet sometimes the truth is too simple

for some...	The Warren Commission
thought they had an open and shut
case: three bullets, one assassin -
but two things happened that made it
virtually impossible: 1)the Zapruder

film which you just saw, and 2)the
third wounded man, Jim Tague, who

was nicked by a fragment down by the
Triple Underpass.	The time frame of
5.6 seconds established by the

Zapruder film left no possibility of
a fourth shot from Oswald's rifle,
but the shot or fragment that left a
superficial wound on Tague's cheek
had to come from a bullet that missed

the car entirely.	Now they had two
 

bullets that hit, and we know one of
them was the fatal head shot.	So a

single bullet remained to account
for all seven wounds in Kennedy and
Connally.	But rather than admit to

a conspiracy or investigate further,
the Commission chose to endorse the
theory put forth by an ambitious
junior counsellor, Arlen Specter.
One of the grossest lies ever forced

on the American people, we've come
to know it as the "magic bullet"
theory.

CUT TO a drawing which has been put on a chair for the Jury. Jim has also moved Al, acting as J.F.K., into a chair directly behind the larger Numa, acting as Governor Connally. He demonstrates with a pointer.

JIM

The magic bullet enters the
President's back, headed downward at
an angle of 17 degrees.	It then
moves upward in order to leave
Kennedy's body from the front of his

neck - his neck wound number two -
where it waits 1.6 seconds, turns
right and continues into Connally's
body at the rear of his right armpit -
wound number three.	Then, the bullet

heads downward at an angle of 27
degrees, shattering Connally's fifth

rib and leaving from the right side
of his chest - wounds four and five.
The bullet continues downward and

then enters Connally's right wrist -
wound number six - shattering the
radius bone.	It then enters his
left thigh - wound number seven -
from which it later falls out and is

found in almost "pristine" condition
on a stretcher in a corridor of
Parkland Hospital.
(he shows a mock-up
of the "pristine"

bullet)
That's some bullet.	Anyone who's

been in combat can tell you never in
the history of gunfire has there
been a bullet like this.

(the court laughs)
The Army Wound Ballistics experts at
Edgewood Arsenal fired some comparison
bullets and not one of them looked
anything like this one.

(he shows mock-ups of
 

comparison bullets)
Take a look at CE 856, an identical

bullet fired through the wrist of a
human cadaver - just one of the bones
smashed by the magic bullet.	Yet

the government says it can prove
this with some fancy physics in a
nuclear laboratory.	Of course they
can.	Theoretical physics can prove
an elephant can hang from a cliff

with it's tail tied to a daisy, but
use your eyes - your common sense -
(he holds the bullet)
Seven wounds, skin, bone.	This single
bullet explanation is the foundation

of the Warren Commission's claim of
a lone assassin.	And once you

conclude the magic bullet could not
create all seven of those wounds,
you have to conclude there was a

fourth shot and a second rifleman.
And if there was a second rifleman,
there had to be a conspiracy, which
we believe involved the accused Clay
Shaw.	Fifty-one witnesses, gentlemen

of the jury, thought they heard shots
coming from the Grassy Knoll, which
is to the right and front of the
President.

Jim walks to a drawing of an overhead view of Dealey Plaza. On it are dots representing locations of the witnesses. He points to each portion. He pauses and looks out into the courtroom - Liz has entered accompanied by Jasper. Quietly she takes a seat. Jim is unbelieving at first, then very moved. He takes a beat, then:

JIM
Key witnesses that day - Charles
Brehm, a combat vet, right behind

Jean Hill and Mary Moorman, S.M.
Holland and Richard Dodd on the
overpass, J.C. Price overlooking the
whole Plaza, Randolph Carr, a
steelworker, who served in the Rangers

in North Africa, William Newman,
father of two children who hit the

deck on the north side of Elm, Abraham
Zapruder, James Simmons - each of
these witnesses has no doubt

whatsoever one or more shots came
from behind the picket fence!	Twenty
six trained medical personnel at
Parkland Hospital saw with their own
eyes the back of the President's

head blasted out.
 

CUT TO: Dr. Peters on the stand.

PETERS
(describing the wound)

...a large 7 cm opening in the right
occipitoparietal area, a considerable
portion of the brain was missing
there.
(he gestures to his

head)

CUT TO Dr. McClelland on the stand.

MCCLELLAND

...almost a fifth or perhaps a quarter
of the back of the head - this area

here...
(he indicates his
head)

...had been blasted out along with
the brain tissue there.	The exit
hole in the rear of his head was
about 120 mm. across.	There was
also a large piece of skull attached

to a flap of skin in the right
temporal area.

FLASHBACK TO: Parkland Hospital Emergency Room on that day in 1963. The doctors work on the President. The wounds on the back of his head are evident but will change later in the autopsy. He is placed in a bronze casket.

JIM (V.O.)
Not one of the civilian doctors who

examined the President at Parkland
Hospital regarded his throat wound
as anything but a wound of entry.
The doctors found no wounds of entry
in the back of the head.	But the

body was then illegally moved to
Washington for the autopsy.

CUT TO: the Secret Service team preparing to wheel the casket out. The Dallas Medical Examiner, Dr. Rose, backed by a justice of the peace, bars the way. A furious wrestling match ensues.

MEDICAL EXAMINER
Texas Law, sir, requires the autopsy

be done here.	You're not taking him
with you!

KENNY O'DONNELL
Sonofabitch, you're not telling me

what to do!	Get the hell outta the
 

way!

The Secret Service agents put the doctor and judge up against the wall at gunpoint and sweep out of the hospital.

JIM (V.O.)
Because when a coup d'etat has

occurred there's a big difference
between an autopsy performed by
civilian doctors and one by military

doctors working for the government.

FLASHBACK TO: Love Field the same day. We see Air Force One taking off and a photo of L.B.J. being sworn in.

JIM (V.O.)
The departure of Air Force One from

Love Field that Friday afternoon was
not so much a takeoff as it was a
getaway with the newly sworn in

President.

DYMOND (V.O.)
Objection, your honor.

JUDGE
Sustained.

JIM (V.O.)
On the plane, of course, Lee Harvey

Oswald's guilt was announced by the
White House Situation Room to the

passengers before any kind of
investigation had started.	The "lone
nut" solution is in place.

DYMOND (V.O.)

Objection!	Your Honor!

JUDGE

Sustained.	Mr. Garrison, would you
please bottle the acid.

FLASHBACK TO: the Bethesda autopsy room in 1963.	The room
is crammed with military officers, Secret Service men and,
at the center, three intimidated doctors.	Pictures are being
taken as they remove bullet fragments.

JIM
The three Bethesda Naval Hospital

doctors picked by the Military left
something to be desired inasmuch as
none of them had experience with
combat gunfire wounds.	Through their
autopsy we have been able to justify

eight wounds - three to Kennedy,
 

five to Connally - from just two
bullets, one of these bullets the

"magic bullet".

CUT TO: Jim in court with a series of drawings indicating with arrows entry and exit wounds to Kennedy's neck and head. Dr. Finck is on the stand, erect, very precise, and irritated.

JIM
Colonel Finck, are you saying someone

told you not to dissect the neck?

FINCK
I was told that the family wanted
examination of the head.

JIM

As a pathologist it was your
obligation to explore all possible
causes of death, was it not?

FINCK

I had the cause of death.

JIM

Your Honor, I would ask you to direct
the witness to answer my question.
Why did Colonel Finck not dissect
the track of the bullet wound in the
neck?

FINCK

Well I heard Dr. Humes stating that -
he said...

FLASHBACK TO: Bethesda autopsy room.

HUMES
Who's in charge here?

ARMY GENERAL
I am.

FINCK (V.O.)
I don't remember his name.	You must

understand it was quite crowded, and
when you are called in circumstances

like that to look at the wound of
the President who is dead, you don't
look around too much to ask people

for their names and who they are.

JIM (V.O.)
But you were a qualified pathologist.
Was this Army general a qualified

pathologist?
 

FINCK (V.O.)

No.

JIM (V.O.)

But you took his orders.	He was
directing the autopsy.

FINCK (V.O.)
No, because there were others.	There

were admirals.

JIM (V.O.)
There were admirals.

FINCK (V.O.)
Oh yes, there were admirals - and

when you are a lieutenant colonel in
the Army you just follow orders, and
at the end of the autopsy we were

specifically told - as I recall it
was Admiral Kenney, the Surgeon
General of the Navy - we were
specifically told not to discuss the
case.

KENNEY

(in Bethesda scene)
Gentlemen, what you've seen in this
room is intensely private to the

Kennedy family and it is not our
business to...

Jim turns away from the jury. His point is made. Finck is no longer on the stand.

JIM

In addition to which, 1) the chief
pathologist, Commander Humes, by his
own admission voluntarily burned his

autopsy notes, 2)never released the
autopsy photos to the public, 3)
President Johnson ordered the blood
soaked limousine filled with bullet
holes and clues to be immediately

washed and rebuilt, 4) sent John
Connally's bloody suit right to the

cleaners, and 5) when my office
finally got a court order to examine
President Kennedy's brain in the

National Archives in the hopes of
finding from what direction the
bullets came, we were told by the
government the President's brain had
disappeared!
 

There's a pause, and then a murmur from the court. Jim is on a roll and knows it. The faces in the courtroom are with him, absorbed, horrified. The law students are still there, they have been since day one. But it is Liz's interest that touches him the most.

JIM

So what really happened that day?
Let's just for a moment speculate,
shall we?	We have the epileptic

seizure around 12:15 P.M....
distracting the police, making it
easier for the shooters to move into
their places.	The epileptic later
vanished, never checking into the

hospital.	The A Team gets on the
6th floor of the Book Depository...

FLASHBACK TO: the Book Depository, 1963. A shooter and two spotters dressed as working men move into the Oswald spot. One spotter produces the Mannlicher-Carcano.

JIM (V.O.)
They were refurbishing the floors in
the Depository that week, which

allowed unknown workmen in and out
of the building.	The men move quickly
into position just minutes before
the shooting.

The camera takes the shooter's point of view: we see down the street through a scope. His spotter wears a radio earpiece. The second spotter is working out of the southeast window.

JIM (V.O.)
The second spotter is probably calling

all the shots on a radio to the two
other teams.	He as the best overall
view - "the God spot".

Inside the Dal-Tex Building, a shooter and a spotter dressed as air-conditioning men move into a small second-story textile storage room.

JIM (V.O.)
B Team - one rifleman and one spotter

with a headset, with access to the
building - moves into a low floor of
the Dal-Tex Building.

At the picket fence a shooter in a Dallas Police uniform moves into place, aiming up Elm Street. His spotter has a radio to his ear. Another man in a Secret Service suit moves further down the fence.
 

JIM (V.O.)
The third team, the C Team, moves in

behind the picket fence above the
Grassy Knoll, where the shooter and
the spotter are first seen by the

late Lee Bowers in the watchtower of
the railyard.	They have the best
position of all.	Kennedy is close
and on a flat low trajectory.

Part of this team is a coordinator who's flashed security credentials at several people, chasing them out of the parking lot area.

An "agent" in tie and suit moves on the underpass, keeping an eye out.

In the crowd on Elm Street, we catch brief glimpses of the umbrella man and the Cuban, neither of them watching Kennedy, both looking around to their teams. There is a third man, heavyset, in a construction helmet.

JIM (V.O.)
Probably two to three more men are
down in the crowd on Elm... ten to

twelve men... three teams, three
shooters.	The triangulation of fire
Clay Shaw and David Ferrie discussed
two months before.	They've walked
the Plaza, they know every inch.

They've calibrated their sights,
practiced on moving targets.	They're

ready.	It's going to be a turkey
shoot.	Kennedy's motorcade makes
the turn from Main onto Houston.

J.F.K. waves and turns in slow motion.

JIM (V.O.)
Six witnesses see two gunmen on the

sixth floor of the Depository moving
around.	Some of them think they're
policemen with rifles.

From Houston Street we look up at the sixth floor of the Book Depository and see the shooter moving around. Arnold Rowland points him out to his wife.

ARNOLD
(under)

...probably a security agent.

In the Dallas County Jail, Johnny Powell is one of many convicts housed on the sixth floor - the same height as the men in the Book Depository. We look across to the Depository through cell bars. Johnny and various cell mates are watching
 

two men in the sixth floor of the Depository.

JIM (V.O.)
John Powell, a prisoner on the sixth
floor of the Dallas County Jail,

sees them.

POWELL
(under)
...quite a few of us saw them.

Everybody was hollering and yelling
and that.	We thought is was security
guys...

JIM (V.O.)

...they don't shoot him coming up
Houston, which is the easiest shot

for a single shooter in the Book
Depository, but they wait till he
gets to the killing zone between

three rifles.	Kennedy makes the
final turn from Houston onto Elm,
slowing down to some 11 miles per
hour.
