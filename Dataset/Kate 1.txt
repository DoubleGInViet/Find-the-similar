HELLO-KITTY WAVES AT US

Pulsing neon on massive billboard.
Seen through a window.
It’s fluorescent arm wagging.
Left. Right. Left. Right.

We SHUDDER. And GASP...

KATE (V.O.)
I want to talk retirement.

The accent, proper London.

...THEN BLINK:


A LUXURY SEDAN. NIGHT

Navigates the glitz at Shibuya Crossing.
Surge of pedestrians.
Beneath mammoth video screens.
Shoppers. Tourists.
Manic detonation of color and fashion.
TOKYO.

Brash Texan drawl,

VARRICK (V.O.)
Thought we discussed that
yesterday?

A WOMAN

Silhouetted in the backseat.
Completely still.
Watches through closed window.
Thrumming gloss smearing her reflection.

KATE (V.O.)
We started.

VARRICK (V.O.)
And we’ll finish soon’s you close
the Tokyo deal.

Plexiglass isolating her from Driver.
Ink peeking from collar, curving up his neck.
Dialing wheel. Away from the Station.

KATE (V.O.)
You said that before Berlin.

It starts raining...






 
2.


HOTEL ROOM. LATER

Floor-to-ceiling window.
Polychromatic light irradiates from without.
Modern. Practical. Antiseptic.
Codified to her liking.

VARRICK (V.O.)
I said you should consider a
vacation. Think I suggested Bora
Bora.

Subtle movement. Someone’s here...
Calmly thawing from the murk.
She’s been here. Swathed in shadow.

Took this long to notice.

KATE (V.O.)
Sharks, pythons, paralysis ticks.
Bora Bora’s a deathtrap. I don’t
want a vacation, I want to talk
exit strategies and insurance;
thirty-two years, Varrick, I want
to talk severance.

Uttered with flat prosody.


BY THE WINDOW

38 floors up. Reflecting on the city below.
Wafers of light delineate her.
We get our first look.

VARRICK (V.O.)
They tell me retirement’s the most efficient murderer of elder folk.

KATE
Piercing cobalt gaze.
Calm. Expressionless. Cold.
Unnervingly static. Barely has a pulse.

KATE (V.O.)
That why you’re still working?

Even the blinks are deliberate.

VARRICK (V.O.)
I never stop to think about it.

Coolly regarding the city. Or herself.
Mileage in the eyes only she gleans.






 
3.


VARRICK (V.O.)
But that’s what you’ve been doin’?

Her reflection hovering over Tokyo.
A ghost haunting the metropolis.

VARRICK (V.O.)
Still there?

No evidence of respiration.

VARRICK (V.O.)
Kate...

Her head tilts fractionally.
Eyeing her wristwatch.


HOTEL BAR. LATER

Untouched drink before her.
Cell to ear, this is the convo.

VARRICK (O.S.)
Alright tell you what, I’ll divert my flight to Tokyo tomorrow and we’re gonna talk then.

KATE
We’re already talking.

Japanese salarymen. Few gaijin.
One spying her from a stool over.

VARRICK (O.S.)
And I’ve already done as discussed, HR’s assured me they’re drawin’ up the insurance papers and-- Look, you’re our ace closer, Kate, so don’t give ‘em a reason now and bring this home like always.

KATE
Complete severance consolidation.

Deep exhale on the other end.

VARRICK (O.S.)
Tomorrow, face-to-face.

KATE
Get it done.

She ends the call.






 
4.


STEPHEN (O.S.)
They must be killing you. You
haven’t even touched your drink.

THE AMERICAN sitting beside.
Kate’s glare frigid.
Before returning to her cell.

STEPHEN (CONT’D)
Whoa, back up, total pick up line.
(putting up hands)

Been here a week, heard English and keyed in. Involuntary, I swear.

Scoops his drink, shifting away.

KATE
I believe you.

Faux brow wipe, ‘Whew’.

KATE (CONT’D)
That scary? Couldn’t risk it being misconstrued as flirtation.

STEPHEN
Oh, no, that’s not--

KATE
Ice-bitch British bureaucrat, I get
it.

Recovery attempt.

STEPHEN
No, no, just didn’t want it
misconstrued as bad flirtation.

Kate gives him a relaxed once-over.
He beams. Offers a hand.

STEPHEN (CONT’D)
Stephen.

She considers before taking it.

KATE
Angela.

Sliding closer.

STEPHEN
No soul-stabbing, work-related
talk, I promise.






 
5.


LATER

Drink still untouched.
But she’s looser.
He’s on his third.
Not quite slurred.
Yet.

STEPHEN (CONT’D)
I mean, who on their deathbed’s
ever said, “I wish I’d worked
more”?

KATE
Everyone who didn’t make partner?

He’s mouthing, ‘Ha ha.’
Slugging the rest.
Gesturing for another.

KATE (CONT’D)
They keep trying to placate me with vacations.

STEPHEN
Vacations! Mm--

Dipping into the fourth.

KATE
No good?

STEPHEN
Alright, look, I wasn’t always Captain Skeptical. First vacation, Nassau, I came back and proclaimed it a paradigm shift.

KATE
Wow. Sounds affirming.

STEPHEN
Last year, Caracas, unbearable.

KATE
Sure. Most violent city in the
world. 119 homicides per 100k.

STEPHEN
Uh, right. I meant the vacations themselves. Each one a time out, to reflect. On who you could’ve been, if only you’d gone that way instead of this. If it’s too late for that.






 
6.


KATE
Path not taken, it’s a vicious
chestnut.

STEPHEN
Every year that person dies a
little. Then it’s all over. Is
anyone gonna care we were here?

KATE
Consider retirement.

A pensive swig.

STEPHEN
This profession, my career...
that’s not such an easy call.

KATE
Till it’s too late for that guy.

Raising his glass.

STEPHEN
To getting out. Before our bodies
fail us.

KATE
You’re a bit adorable, Stephen.
(off his look)
That was flirtation.

BACK IN HER ROOM

Frenzied sex in the shadows.
Filtered lights playing across them.

MUCH LATER

Bedside clock blinks 11:59 PM.
Kate stands there watching it.

Alarm vibrates at midnight.
For a second. She taps it off.

Nudging Stephen with her foot.
Asleep in a sheet tangle.
Comes alive with a yawn.

STEPHEN
What time is it?

KATE
For you to leave.






 
7.


Squints at her standing by window.
Marshals a playful smile.

STEPHEN
How was it?

She nods to small cash wad.

KATE
There’s extra.

On his feet now, dressing.

STEPHEN
Was it okay? I riffed on what you specified. Tried to make it honest.

Her silence killing his smile.

STEPHEN (CONT’D)
We’re not that different, you know.
In what we want.

Glare neglected, she’s facing the city.
He snatches the cash. Pads out.


BATHROOM

Fogged.
She showers.
Methodic. Economical.

We catch fractions of her body.
Horrific swirls of scar tissue.
Each one a story.

Kills the spray.

Hands paste nicotine patch on thorax.
It’s concave.
Mastectomy scarred.

BUZZ. PRELAP the door buzzer.


HOTEL ROOM. NEXT MOMENT

BELLBOY enters, pushing trolley.
Squints, adjusting to ambiance.

Kate seated across, facing him. Backlit.
One leg draped over the other.
Calmly pulling on gloves. Watching.






 
8.


He only discerns her silhouette.
Bows. Exits quickly.

She stays. Another moment...
Then moves.
Three perfect strides.
At the trolley.

Ignores food, lifts the wine.
Checks vintage. Pops. Pours.
Exactly a quarter glass.

No more. No less.

Sips. Not to her liking.
Nostril flare gives it away.
Swirls lightly.

Pulling A PELICAN CASE from bottom section.
Keys her phone. Unlocking case.
Click. Electronic bolts unlatch.

An SGW Scope Rifle housed in velvet.
In four clean sections.
Beside ear-piece.

She eyes it. Drains the glass.

MOMENTS LATER

Kate assembles the gun.
A magician. Precise. 4 seconds.
Not a move wasted.

Cleans two rounds with pristine napkin.
Chambers both. Just two.

No more.
No less.

Discards gloves.
Not a trace.

EVEN LATER

She dresses before mirror.
Meticulous as a bomb tech.
Perfectly fitting a monochromatic outfit.

Slacks. Shirt. Crisp collar, unbent.
Without wrinkle. Or blemish.
Her diligence like a soldier donning uniform.

Or, armor.






 
9.


Keen eyes absorb her reflection.
Finally, an expression...
Barest hint of a frown.

On her shirt, a spec. A flaw.
You and I would never notice.

She fastidiously undresses.
The shirt must go.


AZABU-JUBAN STREETS. DAWN

Old wealth. Upscale. Yet earthy.
Sheeting rain.
Sidewalk already mobbed.
Jostling crush of umbrellas.

A parka-clad figure cuts through.
Even pace. No umbrella.
Case in left hand.
Case we’ve seen before.
It’s Kate.

KATE
Seasonal on point.

Into ear-piece. Lips never moving.

VOICE
(anonymous, feminine)
Copy. Building 2-8-14.

Diverting down an alley.
Crooked narrow slope.
Toward row of tenements.

Tokyo Tower looms east.
Over sparse foot traffic.
She nears specified building.

VOICE (CONT’D)
Northernmost service elevator.
You’re clear.

Shrugs off parka without slowing.
It pools behind her in the rain
She’s already in the elevator.
Doors erasing her from sight.


INSIDE BUILDING HALL

Gentrified renovations.






 
10.


Kate glides in.
Outfit jibing.
No second looks.

KATE
Stage mark.

VOICE
Roof, northeast corner.

Every step exact. Calculated.
Nothing ancillary.
Evading surveillance cams with ease.
Effortless caution.

ROOF

Kate emerging through shaftway door.
Moving beneath roof awnings.
Pulling on gloves.
Reaching corner, crouching.
Case open, starts assembly.

KATE
BDG trajectory.

VOICE
500 meters at 45. Southeast at 27.

Doesn’t bother with a ‘Copy’.
Just inserts the two rounds.
Gets into sniper kneel.
Using case as sandbag.

THROUGH SCOPE RETICLE
Sites focus on a RESIDENCE.
Scant bystanders.
CAR parked nearby.

KATE
BDG acquired.

VOICE
Copy. We’re holding.

Sites scan surroundings.
Through tempering rain.

Holds on ANOTHER PARKED CAR.
Far side of the residence.
TWO WOMEN inside eating yakitori.

KATE
Secondaries on this?






 
11.


Nothing outstanding about them.
To us.
She notices the stares.

VOICE
Negative.

KATE
Possible third--

Caught by abrupt tightness in throat.
She coughs to clear the phlegm.
Strains hard to swallow.

VOICE
Seasonal, repeat.

Kate distracted now.
Puzzled.
Feels it before we notice.
The sweat on her forehead.
Breaths audibly hissing though nostrils.

Something’s wrong...

KATE
Possible third-party on scene--

ANGRY BOUT OF PAIN.
Suddenly zapping her stomach, head.
Eyes seizing shut.
Blasting open with alarm.
She grinds enamel.
Biting back the pain.

VOICE
Disregard. No engagement unless.

Then a COUGHING SPASM.
BLOODY.
Flecks her shirt.

VOICE (CONT’D)
Seasonal, report.

Violent bolt of light.
Flashing in her head.
Blinding her a second.
She’s STAGGERING UP.
DOUBLING right back over.
Unbelievable pain.

VOICE (CONT’D)
Seasonal, report.






 
12.


Spitting a lie.

KATE
Holding at yellow.

A WHINE swelling rapidly.
Becomes RINGING in ears.
Vision distorting bad.
Pulses DARK again.

VOICE
Primary exiting. 6 second window.

Kate recovering in a whirl.
Dizzy. Dazed.
Unable to grasp what’s happening.
Bracing herself.

Something going horribly wrong.

VOICE (CONT’D)
Primary visible. Black jacket.

Snapped out of it.
Attempts reset.
Back on the rifle.
Jaw clench. Refocus.
Deep breath. In and out.

SCOPE RETICLE
On two men emerging from residence.
Blue jacket. Black.

VOICE (CONT’D)
Seasonal, you are green.

But her focal point BLURS.
Tracking bad with movement.
Blue jacket now in driver’s.

VOICE (CONT’D)
Seasonal...

Kate forcing herself to reorient.
Pain stabbing again.
And again. And--
Mashing teeth to powder.
Target boarding the back.
Car starting...

VOICE (CONT’D)
Seasonal.

Kate gone fetal.






 
13.


Pain unbearable.
Car moving away...

VOICE (CONT’D)
Window closed. Seasonal, you are
red.

Body in full-blown revolt.
Kate not accustomed to it’s insubordination.

VOICE (CONT’D)
Seasonal, acknowledge deal
nonfulfillment.

Panting hoarsely on her back...

VOICE (CONT’D)
Seasonal, confirm nonfulfillment.

As the implication registers.
She sucks air, rallying for resolve.
Refusing to cede.
Willing herself up.
Wrenching back control.

VOICE (CONT’D)
Seasonal--

KATE
New point.

VOICE
Negative, Seasonal. You’re--

KATE
New point.

Beat.

VOICE
Holding.

Kate snagging the rifle.
Throwing strap over shoulder.
Breaking into steady run.

VOICE (CONT’D)
Right to southwest corner.

Towards opposite edge.
In the rain now.
Jumps five feet of air.
Smashing into lower clearing.







 
14.


KATE
Taking position.

THROUGH SCOPE
Car turning off small street. Towards highway.

VOICE
Seasonal, you are not cleared for
shot.

HEART JACKHAMMERING.
Eyes dilating big.
Losing her knees.
Warping backwards.
Missing the window again.
Car rounding corner.
Vanishing.

VOICE (CONT’D)
Seasonal, you...

A VIOLENT HUM.
Overwhelming all sound.
Kate grimacing.
Unable to speak.

Lurching up anyway.
Quick 360.
Approximating target course.
Shoves into a sprint.
Doused now.
Feet thrashing water.

Hum enduring.
Shards of breathing cut through.
Rain streaking ocular.
She jumps another roof...

Barely makes it.
Slip-skidding towards corner.
Starts the sweep.

SCOPE RETICLE
Scanning. Scanning. Scan--
There.
Car amidst knot of traffic.
Getting on the highway.
Last chance...

PAIN KNIFES again.
Kate stops breathing.
Doesn’t fight it.
Let’s it flood in...
And FIRES.






 
15.


Front tire POPS.
Wild SWERVE.
Car whips outta control.
Caroming into sidewalk.
One behind sinking into it’s trunk

Kate INHALES.
Sound snapping back with a vengeance.
Accompanies pain.
Inciting facial twitch.

SCOPE
Driver exiting.
Black jacket yelling from backseat.
Traffic stalled. Commuters converging.

3 second window. Maybe.

Kate aims.
Sudden THROB of black.
Sends her flailing.
Lost in residual blindness.

Window closing.
On her last round...

Kate trying to detect with sound.
Blood pounding in ears.
Making it impossible.

Wobbling to one knee.
Holds her breath.
Pure intuition.
Kate FIRES...

RED SPLOTCH replaces target in window.

Driver freaks. Ducks. SCREAMS.
Bystanders point. Scatter.
A PAIR already converging.

One she noticed in parked car.
They’re on the corpse.
Sifting pockets.

Kate’s up and moving.
Rifle abandoned there.
Sun breaking over Tokyo Tower.


REAR ALLEY

Kate hunched over.
RETCHING.






 
16.


Catching a palmful.
Blood and bile.

CONVULSIONS rippling through her core.
Teeth gnashed to keep from roaring.

Everything tilting.
Feet swimming for purchase.
Till her back meets a wall.
Slides down it.
Knees drawn up.
Eyes shut. Chest heaving.

Cacophony of SIRENS.
Merging fast.
Kate blinks up.
She’s gotta move.


ON THE STREET

Kate negotiating sidewalk.
Tree-chameleon eyes scan surrounding.
Head does not.

COP CARS doppler past.
One decelerating.
Cops eyeballing sidewalk.

Kate perfectly obscured.
By a Businessman exiting his Mercedes.
Impeccably timed.
Cops coasting on.

Kate thumbing phone without looking.
Resembles a phone anyway.
The Mercedes unlocking as she nears.
Alarm deactivated.

Kate opening door, sliding in.
Not a missed beat.


IN THE MERCEDES

Plugging a dummy key.
Ported to phone device.
Eyes forward. Normal. Natural.
Nothing going on here.

Device coming alive.
Running a script.
Number combos scroll.
Searching for start code.






 
17.


COP CAR coming back around.
Cops scanning thoroughly.
Creeping this way...

Recurring JAB of pain.
Involuntary SHUDDER.
Cops looking over...

Kate BITING cheek. Hard.
Recovering within millisecond.
Cops floating past.

BEEP.
Code found.
She presses start button.
Drives off.


MINATO STREETS

Raft of traffic.
Drifting steady.
Towards Shuto Expressway.
Mercedes in the seam.
Staying apace.

MERCEDES

Kate retaining cool...
Until it spikes.
Withering pain.
Dismantling her senses.

Stomach clenching.
In violent agony.
Sways her head.
Eyes lulling.

MERCEDES VEERING WILDLY.
Left. Right.
SCRAPES flanking cars.
Then SCREECHES ahead.
Pain mounting rapidly.
Runaway train heartbeat.
Pulse roaring.
Fast as the Mercedes engine.
Speedometer tilting north of 200 km/h.
210, 220, 230...

Carving wild through Tokyo.
Eyes searing on road ahead.
Fighting mad.
Against system failure wracking her body.
And brain.






 
18.


Sudden SURGE.
Her teeth GNASH.
Eyes CINCH.

AND A SHARD OF MEMORY SLICES IN Abrupt. Violent. Lightning flash of images. A YOUNGER KATE takes a beating. Indistinct faces hovering. Muffled voices. Kate gritting through. Defiant.

Then back!
Kate JOLTING out of it.
Flushed. Rocked. Sucking breath.
And oh fuck--

Car’s ERUPTED from lane.
THRASHING through.
Straight at a Mitsukoshi store...

Kate YANKING wheel.
Last second.
Hairpin turn.
Tires blackening asphalt.
Mercedes mounting curb.
Pedestrians leaping aside.

Kate’s throat constricting.
To fight back rising bile.
Tears blasting down cheeks.
Absolute agony etched in her gaze.

Mercedes fishtailing onto road.
Kate manic with intensity.
Trying to will away the pain.
Flat-out flooring it.
Pedal stuck to the mat.
Speedometer top-lining.
EXPLODING through a red light.
Chorus of honks in her wake.
SHRIEKING outta control.
Then BLACK...

As her heart quits on her.
Head crashing into wheel.

WHAM!
Mercedes HURTLING end-over-end.
Landing in a crushing explosion.
Of glass, metal, flames.

Honks. Screeches. Chaos.
And through the dissolving smoke.
We see KATE.

Strapped into seat.
Hanging upside down.






 
19.


Motionless.
Lifeless.

BLACK

A long beat...
Disrupted by,

ANOTHER DISTORTED MEMORY FRAGMENT LIVING ROOM. KID KATE on the couch, bloodsoaked face. Flanked by her parents. BOTH DEAD. A stately WOMAN sits across with a gun. This is MOTHER. We’ll never see her face. Posh English:

MOTHER
What would you do if I let you go?

Kate’s face, a fizz of fury.

KID KATE
I’d kill you.

Mother’s LIPS unfurling into a smirk,

MOTHER
You’re going to like your new home.

Then we’re GASPING out.
Blinking.
Painfully.
Everything a blur.
Slowly coming into focus.
Fog lifting.
Adjusting.
Discerning surroundings.

In A HOSPITAL BED.
Cordoned by PLASTIC CURTAINS.
Donning patient gown.
Mesh of IVs. Bleeping monitors.
Not a room...

A HALL

Expansive. Empty.
Excepting her bed.
Like all the others were removed.

Abrupt SHOUTING in Japanese.
Someone noticing her awake, alerting others.

NEXT MOMENT

SIX MEN IN HAZMAT SUITS.
Blink at us.
Beep. Beep. Beep...






 
20.


Kate deadpans back.
Battered and broken.
Rigged to wires, tubes.

Sudden explosion of CHATTER.
Rapid-fire Japanese.
A dizzying babel.
Getting heated.
The men point and argue.

Then just exit.
All of them.
Kate looking after...

LATER

MORE PEOPLE IN HAZMAT SUITS.
A dozen now.
Fierce clamor.
All squabbling over her.

Then big GASPS.
As A MAN cuts through.
Sans hazmat suit.

Marching straight to Kate.
Rips aside the plastic.
Consulting his clipboard.
Perfect English, no-nonsense.

SPECIALIST
Canadian passport. Says your name is Angela Witten. Is that correct?

Gets nothing for it.
Points at the hazmat suits.

SPECIALIST (CONT’D)
Sorry about the precautions,
Angela, I’m a specialist here and
need to ask you a few questions.
(gesturing over)
Are you still doing radioactive
therapy for your mastectomy?

Slow shake in the negative.

SPECIALIST (CONT’D)
Have you had any recent exposure to radioactive materials? Maybe you work near such a place?

KATE
No.






 
21.


SPECIALIST
Because your blood is in a rare
state of mutation, overrun, with
viciously radioactive isotopes.

Pauses for a reaction.
Proves futile.

SPECIALIST (CONT’D) Considering the velocity of decay, and the sheer potency, it was most likely injected directly into your bloodstream.
(meaning)
You were poisoned, Angela.

KATE
Poisoned?

SPECIALIST
It’s lethal, I’m afraid. There is no treatment for this, no antidote, it is already too late. I can’t imagine what it must be like to hear this, Miss Witten, but I want to make sure you understand what I’m telling you?

KATE
What are you telling me?

SPECIALIST
That you have been murdered. It is now simply a matter of your heart receiving the unfortunate news.

Everyone staring at Kate.
Uneasy silence ballooning...

SPECIALIST (CONT’D)
The pain is utterly unmanageable
without these morphine drips so--

He trails off...

Because Kate’s on her feet.
Refusing the verdict.
Tearing off IVs. Tubes. Wires.
Walking out.
Just like that.

Past the men.
Staggering outta her way.
Reacting loudly.






 
22.


Specialist stunned.
Kate making it to entrance.
Before it hits again.
Amplified pain.
Spinning her into orbit.

She persists. Tottering,

INTO THE HALLWAY

PERSONNEL here reacting big.
Mouths are covered.
Pointed fingers. Yells.

Kate lurches on.
One step.
Another.
As far as she gets.

Doubling over.
Wilting to the floor.
Squirming there.
Hacking out a lung.

Staff converging now.
Kate getting assailed.
By tides of pain.
Her eyes BUNCHING,

THROUGH ANOTHER IMPRESSIONISTIC MEMORY OPERATING ROOM. YOUNG KATE being operated on by TWO SURGEONS. Mammogram x-rays on wall. It’s a PREVENTATIVE MASTECTOMY.

MOTHER (V.O.)
Simplify. Resolve problems before
they can become problems.
SNAPPING OUT:

BACK IN THE BED

Left wrist handcuffed to it.
Only two men here now.
Specialist. And Plainclothes Officer.
Specialist translating for him,

SPECIALIST
Detective Sanada here wants to know who we can contact? Besides your entry on a flight from Berlin, there are no records linked to your passport. And no emergency contacts or power of attorney listed on your work visa.

SANADA continues, holding up Kate’s cell.






 
23.


SPECIALIST (CONT’D)
Your phone is locked, and the car
you were driving was stolen.
(pausing for last bit)
Stolen near a crime scene, a murder-

Sanada clarifies.

SPECIALIST (CONT’D)
An assassination.

But Kate’s not listening.

KATE
I was poisoned recently?

SPECIALIST
Very.

KATE
How?

SPECIALIST
The manner, you mean? Could’ve been anything, an injection, a drink...

Sanada wants to know,

SPECIALIST (CONT’D)
Who may have wanted to kill you?

Mumbles without looking.

KATE
You mean in Tokyo?

Eliciting a stutter from Sanada.

SANADA
Who are you?

KATE
What happens now?

SPECIALIST
It will get worse. Rapidly. The morphine is managing the pain now, but in one hour it will be intolerable. In two it will be blinding. Within six hours you will be unable to process thought.

KATE
How much time do I have?






 
24.


SPECIALIST
It’s hard to say, really, it could--

KATE
How much?

SPECIALIST
14 hours, maybe 15. But you won’t
be seeing the sunrise, Angela.

That lands on her.
If you know where to look.
Her chance to start over.
Any hope for a different life.
All gone. Just like that.
The men look on somberly.

SANADA
(subtitles italicized)
So she has to stay on the morphine?

SPECIALIST
We’ll keep inflating the dosage,
but at some point the pain will
overcome it. Before it gets there
we would--
(clears throat)
We suggest euthanasia.

Kate glancing up now.
He’s suggesting she lay down and die.
Before it gets worse.
Not unreasonable. Considering.

To fade away quietly.
Without a trace.
The way she’s existed...

KATE
What blunts the pain, allows
mobility?

SPECIALIST
You’re already on morphine--

KATE
No depressants. I want stimulants.

SANADA
Miss, you are not leaving this
room.

KATE
Name the drugs.






 
25.


SPECIALIST
There’s thebaine, like morphine but a stimulant, oxycodone of course, a morphine derivative, also--

KATE
Give me the cocktail.

SPECIALIST
Miss Witten, there is no way. These drugs, they may dull the pain but will greatly accelerate the decay.
(holding up her cell)
See this battery, this is your life right now, minimal usage may get you through the night, but the more you exert, faster you’ll expend it.

Kate clocking the phone display.

KATE
That’s how much time I have left,
52%?

SPECIALIST
More or less. Probably less.

Kate growls at Sanada,

KATE
Hand him the keys.

She’s got a Ruger on his thigh. His Ruger.
He blinks down at his empty holster.

SPECIALIST
Angela, please-- This is crazy!

KATE
It’s on your femoral, I pull this trigger and you’ll die before I do. Give him the keys.
(to Specialist)
Unlock me.

Sanada awed. Specialist obliging.

KATE (CONT’D)
Gag him, cuff him in my place.

Snapping up her phone.

KATE (CONT’D)
Where are the drugs?






 
26.


HOSPITAL MEDICINE ROOM

Closets thrown open.
Specialist snatching vials, syringes, pills.
Kate standing aside.
IVs still threaded into arm.
Fluid packets in one hand.
Gun in the other.

KATE (CONT’D)
Mix them up. Load them into shots.

She’s ripping off IVs. Snatching his coat.

KATE (CONT’D)
Your wallet too.

She’s shoving the shots into coat pockets.
He’s pleading, sheer professional compassion.

SPECIALIST
Angela, please, it is corroding your insides! The hemorrhaging will cause bleeding of the gums, tooth decay. There will be body sores, muscular atrophy, impairing sight and ability to speak. And if you’re lucky, your heart will give out.
(earnest)
What is it that you want to do?

KATE (PRELAP)
I want to know who killed me?
THUNK!

STEAK KNIFE PINNING BELLBOY’S HAND TO WALL

A palm clamping his mouth. Stifling the scream.
Kate this close to his face.

She’s decided not to.
Fade away quietly, i.e.

HOTEL KITCHEN

Saliva, tears. Bellboy mewls.

KATE (CONT’D)
English?
(taps his temple)
With your head, yes or no.

He nods yes.
Her tone academic.






 
27.


KATE (CONT’D)
Four vital arteries in your hand. I twist half a millimeter and you’ll bleed out in 6 minutes. Understand?
Yes.

KATE (CONT’D)
I’m going to ask yes or no
questions. I want yes or no
answers. You don’t answer, I kill
you. I think you’re lying, I kill
you. Understand?

A trembling yes.

KATE (CONT’D)
You remember me?

Yes.

KATE (CONT’D)
Remember what you delivered?

Yes.

KATE (CONT’D)
Did you put it together?

Yes.
Her grip tightens.
He quivers with dread.

KATE (CONT’D)
Were you hired to poison me?

His eyes dilating huge.
Shaking ‘No’, whiplash fast.
She removes her hand.

KATE (CONT’D)
Where did you get the wine?

BELLBOY
Boss-- the boss give me the wine,
special for 3807.

Kate stark-still.
Eyes digging for veracity.
Bellboy swallowing hard.

BELLBOY (CONT’D)
But he off today, the boss is home, I give you his address, he’s the manager, I give you-- okay?






 
28.


Free hand patting chest pocket.
Pulling order-pad, pen.
Scribbling. Forking it over.
Kate snatching a napkin.
Gagging his mouth.

KATE
Bite down.

Yanking the knife.
Bellboy swooning with pain.
Kate pulling napkin from mouth.
Shoving it into his wrist.

KATE (CONT’D)
Soak it in paraffin, stitch it.

Leaving him coiling to the ground.

KATE (PRELAP) (CONT’D)
Why did you poison me?


LUXURY MEGURO APARTMENT

A family shrivels on the floor.
Mother. Teenage boy. Gawking.
Father on his feet. Bowing repeatedly.
The hotel MANAGER.

MANAGER
Please, I don’t understand.

Kate at the kitchen counter.
Ruger resting there.
Twisting open oxycodone tube.
Pills spilling out.

KATE
Who asked you to poison me?

MANAGER
I don’t know what you mean, please.

Crushing pills with bottom of glass.
Sweeping them into the water.
Swallowing clean.

KATE
Who picked out the wine?

MANAGER
The-- I pick out the wine.







 
29.


KATE
From?

MANAGER
The wine cellar, it’s--

KATE
Who else has access?

MANAGER
Just me. I have sole key to cellar.

KATE
Who told you to pick it out?

MANAGER
No one tell me, it was specified in the room reservation.

KATE
By who?

MANAGER
I don’t know, I-- those reservations come through computer.

KATE
Who enters them on the other end?

MANAGER
They all come from...
(a beat, as it dawns)
...Our owners. The Sumiyoshi Clan.

KATE
Yakuza. I want a name.

MANAGER
Name? I don’t know names, I told
you it’s through computer--

KATE
The Sumiyoshis, you deal with one of their people, give me the name.

Kate walking over.
Ruger held at her side

MANAGER
But-- I can’t! You don’t--

KATE
I’ll start with your family. It
will hurt.






 
30.


Her tone flat, inflectionless.
His eyes going big.

MANAGER
What-- no, please! I can’t--

KRAK!
Wife SHRIEKS.
Shot through shoulder.
He yells, dropping beside her.
Kid wailing.

KATE
Name.

MANAGER
Stop, please!

Ruger panning to the Kid.
Smoke curling from barrel.

KATE
The kid’s next.

Manager’s eyes inflating huge.
Throwing himself across his kid.

MANAGER
You’re crazy! Stop, please, I’ll
give you name!

Kate considers him impassively.
Gun still on the kid.

MANAGER (CONT’D)
Sato-san-- his name is Kujun Sato!

Kate suddenly BLANCHING.
Grinding through pain surge.
Everyone eyeing the gun.
Knuckles whitening around it.

MANAGER (CONT’D)
I deal with him sometimes, Sato,
he’s a Sumiyoshi shatei-- a
lieutenant, I don’t know anything
else! Now please, the gun...

She sights down her gun arm.
Regards the tense grip.

MANAGER (CONT’D)
Look what you did to her! Look what you did to my wife!






 
31.


Kate walking out sans a look.

KATE
She’ll live.


KICHIJOJI STATION

A Musashino city bus pulling away.
Shoal of passengers moving in it’s wake.
A COUPLE in the midst.
STEPHEN with an AMERICAN WOMAN.
His ‘john’. Hand in hand.

Turning into side street.
Towards residential block.
Laughing. Buzzed.

Someone watching from afar...

APARTMENT COMPLEX

Woman leading them inside.
Figure across the street...

APARTMENT BEDROOM

Woman grinding atop Stephen.
Moaning.

SLAM!
Door plows open.
Specter coasting in.
KATE.

Woman leaping off.
Muffling a scream.

PICTURES on dresser.
Of them both.
They’re A COUPLE.
Huh. Kate’s eyes doing new math.

KATE
Do you love her?

Ruger in Stephen’s face.
Terror choking his response...

WOMAN
Who are you!? Who is she?!

KATE
Do you. Love. Her?






 
32.


STEPHEN
Yes-- Yes I love her!

APARTMENT BALCONY

Woman DANGLES head-first off railing.
Mouth taped. Wind WHIPPING.
Stirring her into WRITHING frenzy.

Kate holding her by one foot.
Ruger in other hand
Trained on Stephen.
Heave-ho rocking from dread.
Voice cracking.

STEPHEN (CONT’D)
I swear I didn’t poison you! I--
you didn’t even touch your drink!

KATE
Who do you work for?

STEPHEN
You hired me, through the website, that’s how it works.

KATE
Who owns it?

STEPHEN
No one, I only deal with the
clients, no one else!

Kate laxing her grip slightly.
Woman slipping several inches.
Smothered screams echoing through tape.

STEPHEN (CONT’D)
No! Please-- stop!

KATE
Who set it up, who manages it?

STEPHEN
Her, she does, my wife!

Kate’s eyes skidding across his face.
Stephen sobbing now. Disgorging all.

STEPHEN (CONT’D)
We needed money, okay, we needed money bad. And I was always good at this stuff, you know, listening, talking, providing comfort.






 
33.


Kate’s grip wavering.

STEPHEN (CONT’D)
You were our out! The last client. We have enough to retire from this now, start over different.

Kate absorbing this...
Tightening grip. Straining.
Hauling up the Woman.
Stephen rushing over.
Embracing, soothing her.

BLOOD DRIPPING on him.
PUDDLING at their feet.
He’s checking his wife.

Not hers.
It’s GUSHING from Kate’s nose, mouth.

BATHROOM

Wife idles in doorway.
Kate at the sink.
Swabbing nose.
Stephen handing her peroxide.

STEPHEN (CONT’D)
Rinse your mouth with this.

Kate gargling.
Spitting mouthful of diluted blood.
Something RATTLING in sink.
A tooth.

Kate trying to catch it.
Too late.
It slips down the drain.

She stares at her reflection.
Cuts. Bruises. Sallow face. Drawn eyes.
Barely recognizable.

WOMAN
Someone did this to you?

Genuine concern on Woman’s face.
Stephen with a gallows chuckle.

STEPHEN
Guess it’s too late for you.

Kate still fixed on reflection.
He articulates softly.






 
34.


STEPHEN (CONT’D)
To retire, I mean. No getting out
now. Discovering that person.

Harkening to their existential tete-a-tete.
Kate giving it a ponder...
Her cell BUZZING.
Varrick.

KATE
But they’re gonna know I was here.

WOMAN
Who... who’s gonna know?

Snatching cell, stalking out.

KATE
Everyone.


GINGKO AVENUE. DUSK

Sidewalk cafe. High-end.
VARRICK sipping wine alone.
Rust and snow hair. Slim Whitman sideburns.
Dressed for business.
Always dressed for business.

Kate crossing over.
He starts to stand.
She beats him, sitting opposite.
Eyes locked on his.
He matches, pushes a wine glass over.
Gazes latched in silence.
Varrick like a concerned parent.
Face creasing, can’t contain it.

VARRICK
‘Irreversible’, they’re sayin’? No.
No goddammit. Our guy’s gonna check
you out. We’re gonna find a way.

KATE
You always have a drink ready for
me.

Beat. Varrick getting it.

VARRICK
Jesus, Kate...

She sips it anyway.
Without breaking stare.






 
35.


Pauses at exactly a quarter.

KATE
Like yesterday in Berlin.

Then drains the rest.

KATE (CONT’D)
Staged to divert suspicion from The Firm. Poison me. Send me off. Time-release concoction hits after the job, they get the last ounce out of their agent before expiration. Nice and clean. Did I get that right?

Profound hurt on his face.
Words not coming fast enough.

VARRICK
You’re being ludicrous.

KATE
I’m dying.

VARRICK
That ain’t how The Firm does things, you’re a valued agent, vet status, for Christ’s sake.

KATE
I’ve expired agents before, I know how things get done. Was I part of the contract, no loose ends?

VARRICK
Our agents aren’t expendable, godammit, think I’d let ‘em do that to you?! Three decades together and that’s what you think of me?

KATE
You said it, I’m vet status, how
many vets make it to retirement?

Her face TWITCHES,
WHIPS THROUGH A FLIP-BOOK OF MEMORIES Decades diced into seconds. Sounds and images overlapping.
*	KID KATE and YOUNGER VARRICK, first meeting. MOTHER lingers-

MOTHER (V.O.)
He’s your handler now. Starting
today you’ll deal only with him.

*	YOUNG KATE blows birthday candle in cupcake. Varrick smiles-






 
36.


MOTHER (V.O.)

That makes him your mother, father, best friend, and your therapist.

*	Hectic, bloody. DOCTOR working on Kate’s gnarled side. Varrick right there brimming with concern, blood smeared.

*	Young Kate blasting out of an alley, car screeching up, Kate leaping in, Varrick at the wheel, flooring it.

*	Through the years, Kate and Varrick sharing wine. Varrick always making the same toast. But we don’t hear it as...

Kate SNAPS OUT.
Biting her lip to lull the pain.

VARRICK
I got you approved, you were out.

Paternal agony on his face.
Emotional, sucks down the wine.
Then places something before her.
USB flash drive.

VARRICK (CONT’D)
Severance. The whole package. Tooth
and nail to get it expedited.
Unprecedented by Firm standards.

Waiter interrupts to replenish their glasses.

VARRICK (CONT’D)
Stop fuckin’ around and bring the
bottle!

He bows, takes off.
Varrick taps the USB.

VARRICK (CONT’D)
Routing intel for all the funds,
deposited across your offshores.
Accessible only by you.

Waiter with the wine bottle.
Varrick snatching it, excusing him.
Topping their glasses.

VARRICK (CONT’D)
That’s not the kind of money you
just throw away. No reason to part
with it if they’re gonna turn
around and kill you.

Kate considers... Then,






 
37.


KATE
Who hired me?

Varrick reacting big.

VARRICK
You know I can’t, that’s not how it works. Anonymity’s what keeps this whole damn machine running.

KATE
Anonymous just murdered me.

VARRICK
We don’t know that, alright? Let’s think this through, consider all the possibilities.

KATE
I’ve already questioned all the
possibilities, you were the last
one. That just leaves the client.

VARRICK
I can’t disclose that, Kate. Separation of duties is why our organization exists. Anything else and you know I wouldn’t hesitate. Just tell me, okay, whatever else you need right now, I’m here, let’s-

KATE
I want their name. You don’t give
me the name and I’ll consider you
complicit and kill you right here.

Her voice flat. Icy.
Subzero.
Varrick like a wounded father.
Knows the weight behind the words.
Stunned. Swallows to hide it.

VARRICK
Kate...

KATE
I don’t have time for sympathy.

VARRICK
I tell you and I’m as good as dead.

KATE
Did it look like I was asking
nicely?






 
38.


Her gaze like a drill through his skull.
Varrick shook. Draining his glass.

VARRICK
I’ll need some time, to make calls.

KATE
Bullshit. There’s no authorization for this, call like that is out of the question. Don’t insult me.

He doesn’t bother contending.
Long shut-eye exhale.
Recalls something.

VARRICK
Wasn’t gonna bother with this
anymore, but what the hell.

Reaches down, bag by his feet.
Hauls out wrapped WINE BOTTLE.

VARRICK (CONT’D)
1787 Chateau Lafite, greatest
vintage of the previous century.
Last one sold in ‘85, for $160k.

Faint smile,

VARRICK (CONT’D)
Wasn’t the last. Got word, made the offer before this hit Sotheby’s.

Tears off card stuck to wrapping.
Ripping it up,

VARRICK (CONT’D)
Thought it’d be different
circumstances.

Kate quietly seizing him with a stare.
Doesn’t move. But touch her, she’ll explode.
Face like a mask.
Vacant. Lifeless. Haunting.
Varrick wholly unsettled.

VARRICK (CONT’D)
Kate. Please. Don’t do this.

She reaches into his jacket.
Peeling out a Glock 34.
Just holds it.
Eyes still linked.
Varrick sighs it all out.






 
39.


VARRICK (CONT’D)
It was the Sumiyoshis. I don’t know names, it was arranged through cut-outs. They needed Firm resources to locate the target. These bigger clans are run like corporations now, and target was the Vice-Minister’s Aide so they didn’t want the wetwork exposure either.

KATE
The Sumiyoshis also handled my
accommodations.

VARRICK
That’s right. How’d you--

KATE
Accommodations are outsourced to
third-parties.

VARRICK
Not always, not anymore.

KATE
What about separation of duties?

VARRICK
Budget cuts. If the client offers accommodations, we’ll consider the price point. Theirs was ideal.

KATE
So they could kill me.

VARRICK
Why?

KATE
I can think of four reasons.

VARRICK
Retaliation? No. Contracts are
protected. Agent files aren’t
exposed under any circumstances.

KATE
I’ve personally sanctioned two silk road merchants dealing similar intel. You’re getting old.

Varrick’s memories restoring.
He knows it’s a possibility.
The most rational one.






 
40.


KATE (CONT’D)
There was another party on scene.
Two women.

VARRICK
Don’t know nothin’ about that, if it was part of the act we weren’t informed. We were just the hitters.

She holds out her hand.
He sighs, palming her extra mags.

VARRICK (CONT’D)
I gotta inform the Firm now. You know that right? You’re their responsibility, means they’re gonna put a contract on you. And I know they’ve got local boots on the ground. But for you they’ll even expedite out-of-towners. Everyone will want in on this.
(pause)
Unless you kill me right now.

Kate holding him another penetrating beat.

VARRICK (CONT’D)
Sumiyoshis are animals, the worst
kind, where would you even go?

KATE
Kujun Sato.

VARRICK
The fuck is he?

KATE
A start.

VARRICK
Dammit Kate, it’s your condition, you’re not thinkin’ right. Tactics, precision, c’mon, you know better.

KATE
I’m taking a more blunt approach.

VARRICK
You’re being rash.

KATE
Thing about being dead, there’s no more rash decisions.







 
41.


VARRICK
I don’t wanna make that call, Kate.
Don’t make me. Please.

Kate snatches the Lafite and walks off.
Just like that.
Varrick starts to call after.
Only manages a defeated exhale.
As the Waiter drops off the check.

MOTHER (PRELAP)
Clients take precedence, Varrick,
no matter the circumstance. They’re
not be exposed. Ever!


LONE CAR IN ABANDONED PARKING LOT

Varrick in the driver’s. Cell to his ear.
MOTHER on the other end.

MOTHER (O.S.) (CONT’D) It’s the bedrock of the trade. Any repercussions from the deal get handled by us, not our assets.

VARRICK
I don’t need a reminder.

MOTHER (O.S.)
She’s your responsibility.

VARRICK
I said I had no choice and I meant it.

MOTHER (O.S.)
Every scenario has a logical
contingency, appears you do need
reminding. I’d already noted your

relationship with her getting... let’s say, uncomfortably empathic. And now look where we are. You’ve bled intel you’re not allowed to and it’s going to blow back on The Firm.

VARRICK
Like you said, there’s logical
contingencies, we can still--

MOTHER (O.S.)
Logic? Kate’s a reputation, a
thought problem, we teach it now.
(MORE)





 
42.

MOTHER (O.S.) (CONT'D)
Her ratios are impossible, they
don’t make any sense. There isn’t
another like her.

VARRICK
We made her, we know her, she’s our agent.

MOTHER (O.S.)
We don’t make agents, Varrick, we make monsters. And Kate’s royalty among them, the king, she’s bloody Godzilla and her death thrash is going to stomp Tokyo into pulp.

VARRICK
Look, I know how bad this can get--

MOTHER (O.S.)
Oh for fuck’s sake, it’s already worse! And it puts your retirement into serious consideration. Do you need a refresher on your own asset?

VARRICK
I don’t--

MOTHER (O.S.)
Zero blown assignments. None. Who has that kind of record?! Garza, Mitte, Cape Town, remember Cape Town? 57 men in there and she still made it out, all of them dead. She was 17 then and already inexorable.

VARRICK
63.

MOTHER (O.S.)
What?

VARRICK
63 men, and she was a week from 17. I don’t need a goddamn refresher. She fulfilled it like every other assignment. That’s what she does, who she is. It’s constitutional.

MOTHER (O.S.)
Now she’s given herself one, no
leash, the final assignment.
Personal, primal. The gravity
obviously profound to her.







 
43.


VARRICK
She’s dying, she’s got no time.

MOTHER
Do you think that makes her less
dangerous, or the most?


SHINBASHI AVENUES

Kate barging through.
Trailed inconspicuously.
By multiple OPERATORS.

MOTHER (V.O.)
Right, so get your bloody head in
this, acknowledge the cock-up and
tell me how we survive it.

She ducks into an ALLEY.
TWO MEN hasten after.

VARRICK (V.O.)
She’s covered, I already activated all local Operators, they’re--

MOTHER (V.O.)
Dead.

ALLEY: Dead Operators on the ground. No Kate.

VARRICK (V.O.)
What?

ALLEY: FIGURE appearing behind the Men, they spin --

MOTHER (V.O.)
I’m getting flatlines all over
town. 8th just went down.

-- Both dropping as corpses. Kate already gone.

VARRICK
We have no coverage on her?

MOTHER (O.S.)
Kate hasn’t fired a shot that didn’t hit it’s target in over three decades. So stop fucking around, wake the other monsters and pray they get her before this all burns down!

Silence...






 
44.


MOTHER (O.S.) (CONT’D)
Varrick?

VARRICK
I’m on it.

MOTHER (O.S.)
Please impress me.

Click. She’s gone.
Varrick’s phone DINGING with a message.
File picture of Kate. Scroll of stats.
He keys it. Sound of outgoing messages.
Varrick shuts weary eyes...

A SOUNDPROOFED ROOM

Vacant, excepting a desk and chair.
And A TALL DISFIGURED RUSSIAN MAN.
Legs crossed, smoking in his skivvies.
Turned away from open laptop on desk.
Russian folk squawking from it’s speakers.

AN ORNATE LEATHER TRUNK ON THE FLOOR

THUMPING from inside.
Something fidgeting in there.
Someone.

Noise suddenly stops.
He stands. Jangle of keys.
Unlocks trunk with a CLICK.
Throws it open with his foot.

A NAKED MAN inside.
Fetally contorted, purpled face.
GASPS, eyes blasting open.
Standing, face coming into light.
Identical to the Disfigured Russian.
His TWIN. Looming over. Even TALLER.
Untarnished face, feminine.

DISFIGURED RUSSIAN
(sub’d Russian)
You had enough, you goat fuck?

THE TWINS eyeing each other...
Before Disfigured gets CHOKED up by the throat.
Taller Twin ONE-HANDING it.
SLAMMING him into wall, feet off the floor.
