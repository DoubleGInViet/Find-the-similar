TALL RUSSIAN
Why did you open? I said wait 5
minutes after oxygen runs out.






 
45.


Disfigured GAGGING on cigarette.
Blood vessels stippling forehead.
His own oxygen cut off, when...
His expression turns orgasmic.
Lurid smile pooling on face.
WHAM! Taller one SLUGS him angrily.
Disfigured grins in grotesque nirvana.
WHAM! WHAM! Taller one keeps going.
HAMMERING the smile into enamel.

On the desk, laptop PINGS with notification.
Picture unfolding on screen.
Kate’s.

WHAM! WHAM! KRAK! The pain/pleasure continues...

SHIBUYA CROSSING

THE PUNK knits through the crowds.
25-year old Japanese girl, blowing gum bubble.
Sonic Youth Goo t-shirt, worn jacket, Beats headphones.
HMV tote bag on elbow, records poking out.
Backpack hanging loose. Hip Harajuku DJ.
Guitar riff on phone announces new message.
Kate’s picture, stats.
Punk coolly shifts course while scrolling.

MARUYA RESTAURANT

Charming Mom & Pop’s. Literally.
Punk striding in.
Mom lighting up, Punk bowing.

THE PUNK
The Katsuo-Tataki today, okaa-sama.

BACK ROOM

Mom snapping open ration container.
Two massively over-built MARLIN BFRs inside.
Extra mags. Enormous 350 grain bullets.
Gum bubble pops, Punk grins, zips ‘em into backpack.

AT THE CURB

Tote bag dumped in trashcan.
She’s REVVING a Ducati 1098S.
1090cc engine, 169 miles/hour.
VROOM! She’s gone...

UPSCALE APARTMENT

THE ALBINO sits in the middle of the floor.
Silenced gun in lap. Shoes next to him.






 
46.


HOURS LATER

Above him, sound of a door opening.
Muffled footsteps. A man and woman talking.
Albino stands, staring intently at ceiling.
Footsteps above moving about.
He tracks the louder of the two into,

THE BEDROOM

His socked feet gliding slightly across floor.
A COUPLE in bed. Bullet holes in foreheads.
Albino lulls, exactly where the footsteps above do.
Muted voice. It’s a man’s.
He gauges, identifies where his target should be.
Lifts gun. Careful aim. Five suppressed SHOTS.
THUD of a body above. Done.
Albino heads back. Dismantling gun as he goes.
Tucking pieces into coat. Yanks vibrating cell.
New message. He opens it, a picture.
You know whose.

A woman begins to scream in apartment above...

NARITA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT

THE KOREANS march through arrivals terminal.
SIX of them. Sullen faces. Race-car jackets.
All of them on their cells. Listening.

A PAIR OF KIA STINGERS

Red and Yellow. Await them at the curb.
Sleek bit of Korean engineering.
All six break into simultaneous grins...

UNKNOWN SPACE

A derelict OPERA HOUSE.
Stage up front. Gaudy furniture, chandeliers.
An opera in progress, not one you’ve seen.
A perverse variation, Grand Guignol variety.
Bad lighting sparing us the amoral acts of horror.
Weeping violins in corner accentuating SQUEALS.

An audience of one.
THE PRIESTESS stands alone. In snug green qipao.
She’s a sight. Easy on the eyes, hard to look at.
Milky left eye. Face chiseled to porcelain sheen.
Crooked stance. Deformity in inked leg. Accented by heels.
Someone approaches. On all fours. Unseen.
Presenting cellphone. She scoops it without looking.
Brings it up. Face-to-face with Kate.
An infernal grin scythes her face...






 
47.


GINZA STREETS. NIGHT

Ritzy shopping district.
Tokyo’s Fifth Avenue.
Insane masses.
KATE stomping through.
Bulldozing rather.
An unnatural presence.
Like something that doesn’t belong.

Breath catching suddenly.
MUSCLE SPASM attacking mid-stride.
Kate staggering, clutching chest.
Hand coming away BLOODY.
Shirt SOAKED through.

PHARMACY

Kate lumbering in.
Coat buttoned over shirt.
Careening through aisles.
Eyes lucid with torment.
Snatching bandages, gauze, iodine.

AT THE CASHIER

Cashier sniffing, recoiling.
Like he smells something hideous.
Kate slamming down smudged bills.

PHARMACY RESTROOM

Kate locking the door.
Unbuttoning coat, shrugging out.
Peeling off shirt, wincing in unbidden agony.
Stench of searing flesh like a gut punch.
Her torso a nightmare.
Old WOUNDS OPENING UP.
Skin bubbling, BLISTERING.

Stuffing bandages whole into mouth.
Biting down hard as she can.
POURING iodine on the wounds.
Roaring through mouthful of bandages.
Tears glazing cheeks.
Collapsing on lidded toilet.

Rips open gauze.
Banding it over wounds. Tight, tight, tight.
Taping it down.
Catches her breath. Eyes distant.
Everything before was pain.
This is different.
This feels like dying.






 
48.


BACK IN THE PHARMACY

Lurching out through the aisles.
Noticing nicotine patches on shelf.
Pausing...

GINZA STREETS

Kate SPARKING a cigarette.
Wading through the mobs.
Taking hefty pull, exhausts a cathartic gust.
Catching reflection in store window.

100 miles of bad road.
Bottle of Lafite poking outta coat pocket.
She takes another drag.

MATSUYA DEPARTMENT STORE

Kate striding onto luxury floor.
Scanning clothing racks.
Zeroing on exactly what she wants.
Plucking items without stopping.

DRESSING ROOM

Snapping on fresh clothes.
Same fierce scrutiny and precision.
Jeans. Shirt. Pea coat.
Cloaking guns and ammo.
Strategically accessible spots.
Perfect outfit. Immaculate. Chic.
Her war uniform.
Final glance in mirror.
Pain SWELLING into FLASHBACK,
OUTSIDE UPSCALE RESTAURANT

MOTHER and KID KATE stand holding hands. A HOST apologizing.

HOST
We had to cancel all reservations
for a private event tonight. We--

MOTHER
I’ll be having a word with Reitman
tomorrow. Either way, she needs to
use the loo, show her in, will you?

Host hesitates. But relents under Mother’s stare. Smiling,

HOST
Of course. This way, little lady.

INSIDE. Kate trails him towards the back. Place occupied by a DOZEN MEN in suits. More HEAVIES on the fringes.






 
49.


MOTHER (V.O.)

Your first job in the real world. We don’t have an exact head count, but you know the target and the layout. You’ll have a Glock, 15 rounds. It’s all you can conceal inside, so make it count. Car will pick you up at the rear exit.

As they approach the main table, Kate stops, taking a knee. Host turns, sees her tying her shoe. Smiles. It disappears when she comes up. Aiming a Glock 19 at the Target.

A stunned pause. As she pulls the trigger.

Click! It’s empty.

Everyone deflates with laughter. This silly kid...

One snatching the Glock, exclaiming, “It’s real!”

Everyone reacting, snapping into action, guns coming up. Kate swiping a steak knife off table, LUNGING FORTH --

OUTSIDE. KRAK! KRAK! KRAK!	Muted GUNFIRE echoes from inside.
SEDAN idling by rear exit. Finally, door opens. Kate emerges.
Soused in blood. Not hers.

SEDAN. Kate climbs into backseat. Mother waiting there.

MOTHER
Is he dead?

KID KATE
They’re all dead.

MOTHER
The job’s done. Good.

KID KATE
The gun was empty. Was it another
test?

MOTHER
The final one. This, is graduation.

KID KATE
What now?

Points at Kate’s soiled clothes,

MOTHER

We get you new suits, and you start working.






 
50.


KATE GROWING UP THROUGH A TYPHOON OF KILL-TABLEAUS Similar. Bodies slathered around. Kate standing over them, coolly reloading. Getting older with each successive one.

Kate painfully WINCES OUT.
Eyes her cell battery: 38%
Then she’s gone.


NIHONBASHI STREETS

Business district north of Ginza.
A convoy winds past the Stock Exchange.
Dark SUVs and Toyota Century sedans.
Pull up behind a slab-stone OFFICE BUILDING.
Sixteen car doors open simultaneously.
The Yakuza emerge.
Young kobun escort an old oyabun to entrance.
Fleet of shatei there bow in sync as he walks in.


FOUR BLACK-SUITED MEN GAWK AT US

Lit cigarettes dangle from gaping maws.
Or between fingers.
Frozen in place.
Someone painfully GURGLING offscreen.
They all blink...

A Man staggers backwards into frame.
Throat clutched, blood spitting through.
Collapses at their feet.
They look down at him, then back up.
Collectively whip out tanto blades.
Crouch for attack.

KATE

Flicks her cigarette.
Moves at them.
Pan up to reveal.
They’re in front of that same BUILDING.


SUMIYOSHI BOARD ROOM

Business meeting.
Yakuza gone corporate.
Office suites the new compounds.

Two old oyabun (Bosses).
Sumiyoshi. Kozakura.
Making vile transactions over dinner.
Sex slaves for weapons.






 
51.


Pair of kobun (proteges).
One stands guard, other works device.
Projecting pictures onto wall.
Of young girls, boys. Their ages.

SUMIYOSHI OYABUN
The last batch was anemic, used up, their hair and teeth fell out within a month, you can’t just feed them boiled eggs and energy drinks.

KOZAKURA OYABUN
That’s why we took care of their
disposal, so you didn’t have to.

SUMIYOSHI OYABUN
I still have to account for the
money and weapons.

KOZAKURA OYABUN
I’ll throw in my sokaiya’s files on Nippon Electronics, that’s about 80 million in blackmail currency.

Off a polite nod-smile,

KOZAKURA OYABUN (CONT’D) You’re the first to pick from this new batch. Foreigners all, I have their passports with me --
(tapping briefcase)
--	so we can conclude this tonight.

SUMIYOSHI OYABUN
These are all 17 and older, you
mentioned you had younger?

Old man’s lips contorting into lewd smile.

KOZAKURA OYABUN
Yes, much younger. However for
those, we will have to renegotiate
the weapons bargain and--

WHACK!
Door gavels in.
Kate stepping forth like a judgement from god.
Blood-specked countenance.
Instantly changing the temperature of the room.

Guttural reactions, shouts.
Kobun moving, weapons out.
Kate faster. Ruger in her hand.
KRAK! KRAK!






 
52.


A shot each. Chests. Center mass.
Both spun like tops. Flailing down.

Oyabun panicked, staggering up.
Kate shrinking them right back.
Kozakura Boss, gun to his head.

KATE
You Sato?
(bug-eyed, shaking ‘no’)
Kujun Sato, where is he?

KOZAKURA OYABUN
Don’t know, I don’t know Sato-san!

KATE
Who arranged the hit on the
Minister’s Aide?

Reaction flitting across his face.
But he keeps shaking his head.
Kate gleaning it.

KATE (CONT’D)
You don’t answer, I shoot you dead.

KOZAKURA OYABUN
I don’t know what you ask, please!

KRAK! Headshot.
Red Rorschach’s the wall.
Gun panning to second Boss.

KATE
Same question. Same deal.

His eyes ballooning from sockets.

SUMIYOSHI OYABUN
You killed him! He’s Kozakura
oyabun! He-- you don’t know what
you done!

KATE
He’s dead, worry about you. You’re
Sumiyoshi?

No answer. Dazed.
Eyes fastened to the corpse.
She snaps her fingers.
Yanking him from his trance.

SUMIYOSHI OYABUN
Yes-- yes, I am Sumiyoshi.






 
53.


Looking up at her now.
Anger shifting his demeanor.
Turning defiant. Setting jaw.
Someone MOANING on floor.
One of the kobun, still alive.

KATE
Who ordered the hit yesterday?

SUMIYOSHI OYABUN
I don’t know.

KATE
Does Sato know?

SUMIYOSHI OYABUN
What?

KATE
Kujun Sato, does he know?

SUMIYOSHI OYABUN
No, he is not-- Sato? No.

KATE
You know him then. Where is he?

SUMIYOSHI OYABUN
Sato is-- he is my kobun, he does
not know these matters, he--

KATE
Where is he?

SUMIYOSHI OYABUN
22nd floor.

KATE
In here?

SUMIYOSHI OYABUN
Yes, but--

She’s tugging his tie.
Jerking him upright.
Spinning him towards entrance.
Ruger stabbing his ear.
Split-second before,
A PLATOON OF YAKUZA ARRIVES.
20 deep. Guns aimed. Frothing mad.

KATE
Drop your weapons and your pants
and back off, else he dies.
(MORE)





 
54.

KATE (CONT'D)
(jabbing further)
Translate. They don’t comply,
you’re dead.

No choice, Boss quickly obliges.
Deafening explosion of reactions.

SUMIYOSHI OYABUN
They will not listen to order, say they understand I am under pressure and that they can kill you.

Kate frigid, mouth set in hard, grim lines.

KATE
This is an SR45, 10-round clip, now down to 7. That inhale before you pull the trigger, I’ll have already put down 4 of you, your rounds will then hit your boss while I execute 3 more, swiping a higher capacity weapon and ending the rest.

They stand firm.
MOANING on floor gets louder, pained...

A rattlesnake-instant, KRAK!
Moaning stops.
No one saw her arm move.
Scalding barrel already back in ear.

KATE (CONT’D)
You blink and you die in the dark.

Boss growls, barking order.

SUMIYOSHI OYABUN
Do as she says! Bakayaro! That’s an order! All of you! Right now!

That’s it. Stand-off over.
Guns wane, clatter. Pants drop.
Men backpedalling into hallway.
Kate prodding the Boss out.


22ND FLOOR

Open floor plan. Burgundy-lit.
Tarped floor. Drain-ducted.
A WOMAN death spams in pooled blood.
Inciting WAILS from A MAN bound to chair.
Worked on by SATO.
An overstuffed pit viper in a suit.






 
55.


SATO
She’s dead, bakayaro, stop puling!

Man bawls on, eyeing his wife’s stiff.
Another Yakuza GRUNT stands near.
Sato sighs, tells him to,

SATO (CONT’D)
Enough, make him stop.

Grunt jams fingers into Man’s mouth.
Adds a fresh incision.
Blood spumes by the liter.
Man gags, muffled screams.

SATO (CONT’D)
Innocent young bride. What a shame. At least you don’t have kids, imagine seeing your little ones worked on like that?

Grunt yanks his fingers.
Man gurgles, vomiting blood.
Urine soaking his leg.
Sato disgusted, bored, waving it off.

SATO (CONT’D)
I’m done, finish him.

Grunt severs the Man’s throat
Stepping back to avoid arterial gush, as--

WHAM! Door splits.
Figure crossing threshold.
Kate, a golem bathed in burgundy.

Shoving the Boss inside.
He slip-wobbles on puddled blood.
Almost comical.
As Grunt pulls his gun--

KRAK!
Kate blasts him through frontal lobe.
His head snaps then wilts.
Body swaying on feet. Nerves mangled.
Arm slapping side. Twitching abnormally.
Spasming eyes agape. LOBOTOMIZED.

Frisson of fear, Sato BLEATS. Backpedals.
Kate hovering over. Imposing. Almost mythic.
A principle given human form.

KATE
Sato?






 
56.


He keeps stuttering back.
Kate fixing him with those dead eyes.
Cinders now. Demonic under the light.
Reflecting his mortality.

SATO
Yes, I am Sato. But--

KATE
You poisoned me. Why?

SATO
Poison? I don’t-- who are you?

KRAK! His knee detonates, blown tire.
He squeals to the ground.

KATE
Yesterday’s hit, I was put up and
poisoned in the hotel you run.

SATO
Please! I only collect money from hotels, I don’t know anything else!

KATE
Who knows, who arranged the hit?

SATO
What?

KATE
It was the Sumiyoshis. I want the
person who made my accommodation?

SATO
Different department, I don’t know!

KATE
Which floor?

He clutches his ruined knee, pleads.

KATE (CONT’D)
This is the Sumiyoshi compound,
where is it, which floor?

SATO
Not here! They not here tonight!

KATE
I want a name and address.

She’s dragging him by pants leg.






 
57.


Towards window. His nails scraping plastic.

SATO
Stop! Stop, please!

KATE
Name and address or you go out the window.

SATO
They out of town tonight, karaoke
in Golden Gai! Please!

Sato wailing, drenched in blood and sweat.
FOOTFALLS pounding outside. Dozens.

KATE
Name. Address.

SATO
Kishikawa! It’s his department! At
Golden Gai Karaoke tonight!

YAKUZA FLEET REACHING THE DOOR.
Freezing. Absorbing the scene. Awed.

Entire floor a crimson nightmare.
Boss soaking on ground.
Ogling lobotomized Grunt.
Still swaying to and fro, a pendulum.
Dead eyes, lips fauceting spit.
Blood gasping from wound.

Kate at the window, Sato by the pants.
Flicking oxycodone straight from tube.
Like Mentos. Swallowing dry.

KATE
Kishikawa, Golden Gai Karaoke?

SATO
Yes, yes-- Kishikawa!

As the lobotomized Grunt flops.
A spasming tangle of limbs.

All eyes snapping to him, when-- SMASH! Sato gets tossed through window. 22 floors up, scream a fading echo...

Yakuza reacting, flummoxed.
Kate’s not there, already gone.
Isn’t running to hide.

She’s coming at them.






 
58.


KRAK KRAK KRAK KRAK KRAK KRAK!
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 of them go down.
Pirouetting blood.
Before even getting a shot off.
Kate halfway there, dropping Ruger.
Cycling out the Glock.
Men rushing in one-by-one.
Getting felled just as fast.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 more. Rapid-fire.
Headshots all.

Rest shooting blind, backtracking.
Hitting their Boss’ face.
Realization eliciting horror.
Not for long.
KRAK KRAK KRAK KRAK KRAK!
Brains blasted to burgundy wine.
Their bodies sack the floor.
Clearing doorway.
Kate stepping through,

INTO THE HALLWAY

An apparition.
Gun-grip shifting to C.A.R. method.
Center Axis Reload. Max impact CQ flexibility.
Dozen men shooting askew.
Kate blasting the next, before the last’s fallen.
Every trigger pull, a death.
No such thing as wounded.
Burns a mag. Speedloads.
Swaths on. Unrelenting.
Unstoppable.

REAR ENTRANCE

Gunshots echo from upstairs.
Cavalcade of parked cars.
Battalion of kobun by them.
Convened over something on the ground.
Sato’s CORPSE. What’s left of it anyway.
All start arming up.

14TH FLOOR STAIRWAY/LANDING

Dozen Yakuza pounding up stairs. Trio approaching landing door, when-- WHAM! A BODY SPLATS down from above. All necks crane up simultaneously, as-- KRAK KRAK KRAK KRAK KRAK! Slugs explode through the door. Peppering the trio.

Kate slamming out a beat later.






 
59.


Emptying clip into one.
Twisting another’s gun-hand.
Blasting three more with it.
Using him as shield.
Rampaging down stairs to the,

13TH FLOOR LANDING

Letting go of his pulped body.
It slumps besides the rest.
One still alive, wounded, groaning.
Painfully aiming up at her, squeezing.
Kate calmly cocks her head to the side.
BANG! He misses by a mile.
KRAK! She doesn’t.

More rushing up the stairs
Kate coolly deviating course.

9TH FLOOR MESS HALL

Mob of kobun mobilizing in a huff.
Gunfire cracking outside like morse code.
Tanto blades out, they rush the door.
Banging open before they reach it.

Kate hurtling in, gun clicking dry.
Instantly stormed by blades.
Blocking with arm, one STABBING through.
Tugs it out, holding it like a chisel.

Meets them head on.
Her arm flashing.
Puncturing heart, kidney, liver.
Blood flowers blossom.
First man dying on his feet.
Second, third, fourth going down.
Kate getting SLASHED.
Pain FLARING through,
IMPRESSIONISTIC FLASHBACKS

YOUNG KATE getting slashed.
JABBING another neck.
HELLO-KITTY WAVING

And another.
KID KATE KNIFING A TARGET

And another.
Pure muscle memory.
Punting the last one into adjoined,

BACKROOM

He smashes through.
TEN YAKUZA here loading guns.
See Kate barging in weaponless.






 
60.


Face quivering with pain.
Eyes trembling, getting overcome,
FRENZIED FLASHBACK

PARISIAN LOUNGE. Same scenario. Armed gangsters. YOUNG KATE
jolting in. Utterly fearless. Palming one’s nose into his
skull, wrenching gun. Carving into the rest. Whirling dervish
of death. Churning blood and smoke. Last body drops and we...

SNAP OUT into a similar haze.
Kate wincing on one knee. Gore soaked.
Not hers. Entire room lays gutted.

VIAL in mouth, stabs it with HYPODERMIC.
Pulling plunger, loading it.
Tapping a vein, burying needle into arm.
Eyes shuddering close, absorbing the drugs.
Opening to a smoother world. Manageable.
Up now. Already moving.
Re-arming as she does.
Can’t stop. No time.

6TH FLOOR STORAGE ROOM

Dingy. Weapon crates line the walls.
Tattoo needle BUZZING under BLARING hip-hop.
Kobun face down on gurney, getting inked.
Others encircling someone on the floor.

A YOUNG JAPANESE GIRL.
13-year old ANI.
Mess of black and fuchsia Manga hair.
Mini skirt. Knee-high socks.
Holding a beer and fuck-you staring back.
At the men hurling insults and beer.

WHAM! Goes the door.
Men getting PLUGGED before she even enters.
Rapid-reloading a Glock. Here’s Kate.

Tattoo Artist fumbling for weapon.
Getting neck speared by tattoo gun.
Kate one-handing it.
Last man’s got a blade to Ani’s throat.

YAKUZA
Stop, I kill her! You--

Kate BLASTS him mid-sentence.
He catapults backward dead.
Splotching Ani’s face with his blood.
Shortest hostage crisis in history.

Kate and Ani the only ones standing.
Eyeing each other...






 
61.


Before Kate’s moving again.
Pain SLUGGING her,
INCITING FLASHBACK

LIVING ROOM. Kid Kate. Bloodied. Flanked by dead parents.
Staring defiant. Same expression as Ani’s. At an impasse...

Snapping out in a WINCE.
Knuckles grinding into temple.
Staggering on.
One step. Two.
Pain LASHING harder.
SEIZING her,
CAPTIVE TO SAME FLASHBACK

Kid Kate. Fork in the road. We know which way she went...

WRENCHING out.
Looking back at Ani.
Frozen in the same spot.
Blood-doused stone face. Angry eyes.
Hasn’t crossed the Rubicon yet.
Still time for her.
Can go either way.
Both sizing each other up...

Then Kate nods begrudgingly.
Instant grin, Ani bolting over.
Taking Kate’s hand. Kate freeing it.

KATE
Stay behind me.

Cracking open crate.
Lined with M67 GRENADES.
Peers at the SERVICE ELEVATOR.

THE LOBBY

All the kobun swarming in.
Sumiyoshi and Kozakura.
Half rushing the stairs.
Other splitting towards,

THE ELEVATOR BANKS.
Ding. Ding. Ding. Ding.
Every elevator arriving simultaneously.
Men freezing up, guns steady.

Ones by the stairs gawking up.
At A BODY plummeting from above.
SPLAT! Tattoo Artist’s corpse.
Clothes stuffed full of M67’s.

ELEVATOR DOORS PARTING.
Bodies in each one.






 
62.


Similarly stuffed.
Split-second to react before--

WHOOM!
The entire lobby blows out.

THE REAR SERVICE ELEVATOR

Arriving a beat later.
Kate and Ani emerging.
Calmly making their exit.

TOKYO STREETS

SIRENS wailing nearby.
Kate and Ani navigating side street.
Neon-drenched city imposing over them.
Ani wiping off her face.

ANI
Kuu-sooo. I feel like shit.
(up at Kate)
What’s your name? I’m Ani.

Kate doesn’t even look. Ani sulking,

ANI (CONT’D)
What’s your problem?

Kate hastening, turning corner.
Past large ELECTRONICS STORE.
Ani rushing to catch up.

ANI (CONT’D)
Slow down, freaky gaijin!

KATE
Go home.

Her footsteps instantly ceasing.
Kate throwing a casual look back.
Ani tremoring in front of store window.
Eyeing wall of TVs, a news report.
Picture of the murdered Minister’s Aide.

The man Kate killed.

ANI
My dad, they killed my dad...

Gust of anguish blowing through her like a train.
Shuddering, gasping, WHEEZING, unable to breathe.
Kate lulls, watching Ani palpitate...
Finally,






 
63.


KATE
Breathe. You’re having a panic
attack. You’ve got to breathe.

Kate lightly touching her shoulder.
Ani melting into her, hysterical.
Kate looking around, uncomfortable...

KATE (CONT’D)
Listen to me. Close your eyes. Hey.
Close your eyes.

She does. Kate regurgitating a lesson.

KATE (CONT’D)
You’ve got to empty your head.
Okay? Stop reacting. Don’t expect
anything right now. When you open
your eyes, you’re going to see the
street, the sky, lights, nothing
else. You’re not going to react to
what’s not here.
(generous pause)
Open them, slowly.

She does, extricating herself.

KATE (CONT’D)
You’re going to be okay.

Ani wiping tear-matted hair from face.

ANI
How do you know?

KATE
You’re alive.

Her mouth curls downward, fighting vertigo of grief.

ANI
I hated him, I-- he wasn’t a good
dad but he was all I had.

Pulsing sobs. Kate waiting it out...

KATE
Can you get home?

Whipping up, teary gaze a blister of anger.

ANI
They kidnapped me and killed my dad
I can’t go back!






 
64.


KATE
Go to your mother.

ANI
I don’t have one!

KATE
Friends then.

ANI
Friends got me kidnapped.

Staring Kate down, trembling eyes...
Kate blinks, turns, walks off.

KATE
Figure something out.

ANI
You’re just gonna leave me here?!

KATE
I don’t have time.

Ani stomping behind in a huff.

ANI
What if they come after me?

KATE
Go to the police.

Ani SNORTS, stream of angry Japanese.

ANI
They were gonna rape me, you know?
They’ll do worse if they catch me.

KATE
Not my problem.

ANI
Then why’d you save me?

Kate’s face, not sure she can answer that...

KATE
Stop following me.

ANI
Where are you going?

Points off without looking.







 
65.


KATE
Go away.

ANI
Where?!

KATE
I don’t care.

ANI
If you’re not gonna take me you
might as well have left me there!

KATE
You can’t come with me, you’ll die.

ANI
I’ll die if I don’t!

But Kate’s still moving.
Can’t stop. No time.
Ani relents. Watching her go...

Kate suddenly pausing.
Ani perks.
Then puzzles, because--
Kate’s doubling over, shrinking to fours.

ALLEY

Kate RETCHING BLOODY.
Crumpled in searing pain.
Fumbling out hypodermic.
The vial rolling away.
Kate too weak to reach it...

ANI scooping it up.
Kate trying to speak.
CHOKING out a single word.

KATE
Medicine...

Ani palming Kate the vial.
Holding her hands. Assisting.
As she loads the shot.
Sinking it into her vein.
Eyes closing with an exhale.

ANI
What’s wrong with you?

KATE
Dying... This gives me a few hours.






 
66.


ANI
So you can kill who did this?

Kate opening her eyes.
Taking in Ani.
Perceptive. Tough.
Kate at 13.

ANI (CONT’D)
I know it. I can tell. You’re a
killer motherfucker.

Offering Kate her hand, resolve crystallizing.

ANI (CONT’D)
I’ll help you. You need me.

Kate uprighting by herself.

ANI (CONT’D)
Everyone’s corrupt, they killed my dad, they’ll kill me too, they’ll--
(gently)
Please. Just for tonight. I’m not
safe without you.

KATE
I’m dying.

ANI
That’s why you need my help.

Kate slowly looks over, finds Ani smirking.

ANI (CONT’D)
You can’t walk around like this.

KATE
What?

ANI
Your clothes. Do you have a phone?

VENDING MACHINES

Ani punching buttons on Kate’s cell.
Dropping cellophane-wrapped shirts into slots.

KATE
What’re you doing?

ANI
The charge just goes on your cell.
Where have you been?






 
67.


At a lively avenue amid Romanji signs.
Eclectic crowds of gaijin and salarymen.

KATE
This is stupid. Let’s go.

Ani imitating her, gruff.

ANI
“Yes! Clean clothes are stupid. Everything I wear should be covered in BLOOD!”

Ripping open cellophane package.
Holding a Totoro shirt up to Kate.
Cartoon pic of just eyes, teeth, whiskers of a cat.

ANI (CONT’D)
(completely earnest)
Awww, it’s so cute on you!

Kate looks down at the shirt.
Back up at Ani. Eyes cornered.

SUBWAY

Totoro shirt beneath Kate’s coat.
They sit side by side, rocking faintly.
Ani fidgets. A hyper-active quality to her.
Attention darting like a startled animal.
Touching Kate’s wounds. Talking non-stop.
Kate stark-still. Unblinking eyes forward.

ANI (CONT’D)
Does that hurt?

KATE
When you do that.

ANI
You’re like that person in a
nightmare.

KATE
Thanks.

ANI
Person you don’t remember, but you know they are scary. How are you so cool at killing? Will you show me?

KATE
No questions. You want to stick
with me, stop talking.






 
68.


Ani pauses, looking at her.

ANI
You’re weird.
(chuckles)
My own killer gaijin. Cooool.

Pain flooding Kate, teeth GNASHING through,
A TRAINING MOSAIC

KID KATE among fellow KIDS, their faces smudged from memory.
All standing before Mother, her face unseen as usual.

MOTHER

You are here because you are monsters. You don’t know this yet, but most of you are sociopaths. Some homicidal. We are here to find out which ones can be utilized.

GUN RANGE. Kids lined up assembling weapons. Shooting. Kate among them. Flinching with each kickback.

MOTHER (V.O.)

Weapons must become an extension of your body. Using them, second-nature. Like breathing. And remember, anything can be a weapon.

VIEWING ROOM. Kids stood in a circle, watching some abhorrent act in the middle. Too repulsive, too graphic, too horrifying to show. Wide eyes quivering. One pukes. Another faints.

MOTHER (V.O.)
Nothing can frazzle you, derail
your focus, no matter how toxic.

GYM. Kids paired off, sparring. Brutal. Bloody.

MOTHER (V.O.)
Wind pipe, temple, ears, kidney,
knee and tendon. All weaknesses.

ENDURANCE ROOM. Kate strapped to chair. Getting WAILED on.

SHOWER: Kate SOBBING afterwards.

MOTHER (V.O.)

You’re in pain. But pain does not control you. You control the pain. And what can be controlled can be used.

MAZE. Kate with a gun, running through chaos. Blaring alarms, pulsing lights, thick smoke. Frazzled. Gets taken down.






 
69.


MOTHER (V.O.)

You must teach yourself stillness. Let nothing make you afraid. Because all things pass away. God never changes.

TIME PASSES. Same scenarios. Over and over. SPED UP. Finally,

GUN RANGE. Kid Kate assembling weapons, different variations, faster than everyone else. Shooting with ease. No flinching.

MOTHER (V.O.)
Let nothing make you afraid.

VIEWING ROOM. Kate watches nonchalantly. Dead eyed gaze.

GYM. Kate’s opponents getting bigger. And older. Going down all the same. One hit takedown. Kate always the one standing.

MOTHER (V.O.)
All things pass away.

ENDURANCE ROOM. Kate getting assaulted in chair. Deadpan glaze. Body pummeled. Mind elsewhere. Controlling the pain.

SHOWER. No tears anymore. No soul either. All remnants of humanity vaporized.

MOTHER (V.O.)
God never changes.

MAZE. Kate blowing through the mazes. More chaotic they are, the faster she clears them. Insane focus and will.

MOTHER (V.O.)
Teach yourself stillness.

SMALL CHAMBER. Kid Kate sits across the table from a Boy, fellow recruit. A disassembled gun before both.

MOTHER (V.O.)
20 seconds. Only one of you comes
out of that room or you both die.

BUZZER goes off. Both start swift assembly. Boy finishes, aims at Kate. She’s already pulling the trigger. KRAK!

OUTSIDE. Kate exits, hands gun to INSTRUCTOR, walks off without a look. Instructor smiles, calls after:

ANI’S VOICE
Hey, we’re here! Hey, are you okay?

Kate SNAPS OUT, Ani looking at her weird.






 
70.


SHINJUKU STREETS

They emerge from Shinjuku Station.
Instant blitz of color and fashion.
Packs of young girls parading past.
Dressed alike. The Tokyo ‘Fashion Tribes’.
The Manga girls. The Gothic-Lolitas.
Blue lipstick. Pastel hair. Mini-kilts.

ANI
In here! I need to get my stuff.

Ani leading now, pressing ahead quickly.
Through the raucous nighttime crowds.

KATE
Wait.

CLUB HARLEM

Hundreds of kids mill about in Fubu and Hilfiger.
Pants sag, ball-caps perch sideways, atop ghetto weaves.
Hard, dissonant gangsta-rap thumps from inside.
The epicenter of J-Pop.
DOORMAN already lifting cordon for Ani, knows her.
Kate clutching her arm.

KATE (CONT’D)
The hell are you doing?

ANI
I need to get my stuff, it’s here!

KATE
What stuff?

ANI
It’s important, okay.

KATE
We don’t have time.

ANI
Just take a minute. Let go of me!

KATE
One minute and I’m--

Mid-sentence, Ani walks into the club.

INSIDE

A thuggish Japanese MC on stage.
Hundreds of teens follow his call-and-response.






 
71.


Ani pushing through waving arms.
Running into her friend, MAKO.
Platform shoes, sunglasses in the dark.
She shrieks, hugs Ani, using her as ballast.

Kate the only one wearing white shirt.
Glowing conspicuously beneath the black light.
Ani gesturing to her, covering mouth, giggling.
Growing livelier under snowballing group of friends.

ANI
I swear I was a hostage, it was so cool!

The resulting giggles buried in music.
Ani wild and solicitous, people assume everything’s a joke.

ANI (CONT’D)
They killed my dad anyway, but this tall gaijin is gonna kill them all.

Kate sees Ani bum a cigarette from a man.
Take a few greedy drags.
Kate’s brows arch in disapproval.

BACK ROOM

Mako guiding them to a booth.
FOUR MEN stooped around a mirror.
Ani whispering to Kate.

ANI (CONT’D)
That’s the guy helped kidnap me,
Hiro, he put something in my drink.

HIRO looking up in shock. A heavily-pierced gurentai.
Scorched blonde hair. Camouflage jacket.
Sitting beside a ‘man-bag’.

ANI (CONT’D)
Hiro! Where’s my purse, you child
molestor?

Like he’s seeing a girl he murdered, return from the grave.
Surprise quickly relenting to aggression.
He stands, spilling powder, causing panic.

HIRO
Who’s this haku-jin?

ANI
My new sugar-mama. She’s American,
she’s from Seattle and she...
(thinking)
(MORE)





 
72.

ANI (CONT'D)
...owns a record label, she’s going to sign me and take me on tour.

Sniffling nose, he barks at the others.

HIRO
Tell Takura I’ve got her again.

As one of them speed-dials his cell.
Ani lunges at Hiro, HUGGING him, in tears.

ANI
Hiro! Why did you do that to me? I thought you cared about me!

Hiro embarrassed at the pleading outburst.
Coldly staring back at Kate.
Ani’s face twisting in his chest.
Gesturing at Kate to take the bag.
Kate snatching it without looking.

Ani breaking off, seizing Kate’s hand.
Concealing it, hauling her away.
But Kate’s not budging.

KATE
This guy drugged you?

Locked on Hiro with contempt she’s never known.
Something animal and protective taking over.

KATE (CONT’D)
If you come near her again--

ANI
Let’s go!

HIRO
Then what, haku-jin?

Hiro nears, smirking, hand in pocket...
WHACK! His nose SHATTERS blood across his face.
Pole-axed, blinks once, thuds like bag of cement.
No one saw Kate’s hand move.

ANI
Let’s go!

Kate surprised by her own reaction.
Lets Ani tug her away.

DANCE FLOOR

Back into the deafening music.






 
73.


Shouldering through writhing bodies.
Faces streaked with strobes.
Details fluctuating in/out of darkness.

FOUR MEN threading towards the duo.
Kate, shirt aglow, becoming a blur.
Kicks out knee. Headbutts a mouth, teeth exploding.
As she lances an elbow, flattening a trachea.
Bouncing the last face off the floor.
3 seconds, if that.
They haven’t stopped moving towards,

REAR EXIT

Mountain of a BOUNCER there.
Kate’s arm jolting. Bouncer SMACKING ground.
Squealing blood through crushed nasal cavity.

BACK ALLEY

Ani sifting through the bag.

KATE
You’re 12, the hell are you doing--

ANI
You broke Hiro’s nose, that was so awesome!

KATE
--hanging out with all these--

Ani pulling out Hiro’s .45, brandishing it.

KATE (CONT’D)
...losers.

Kate taking it off her.

KATE (CONT’D)
That was your friend?

ANI
No, he had my stuff.

KATE
Stuff?

Ani fishing out her cellphone, it lights up purple.

ANI
Stuff that got my dad killed. He
gave it to me to hide for a few
days. But then I got kidnapped.
(MORE)





 
74.

ANI (CONT'D)
(weighing heavy on her)
He didn’t have it so they killed
him. It’s important, I have to do
this for him, okay.

KATE
It’s on your phone?

ANI
No, I need the phone to get it.
(Kate just blinks)

From where I hid it. Didn’t I just say he told me to hide it? It’s at the capsule hotel.

KATE
You hid it at a capsule hotel?

ANI
I had a slumber party there last
weekend. I have to go get it now.

KATE
Maybe later.

Kate surging ahead.
Ani sees pain augmenting on her face.
Hurries after.

SCREECH!
A FLOOD OF VEHICLES

Angrily slewing the curb.
Outside grey office building.
THE KOZAKURA COMPOUND.

KOZAKURA BOARDROOM

Angry Sumiyoshis storming in.
Met with angrier Kozakura counterparts.
Four generations of the Yakuza.
From emeritus wise men. The kobun. And shatei.
To punkish chapatsus, with crazy-glued hair.

Kozakura. Sumiyoshi. Facing off.
Accusing each other for the massacre.
Oyabun killed on both sides.
Seeking retribution, blades coming out.
Seconds from full-blown WAR.

A hoarse voice cutting through.
SUSUMU stalking in. Everyone bowing.
Young Kozakura oyabun. Businessman demeanor.
SANADA in tow. Detective from hospital.






 
75.


Clicking on giant display.
SECURITY FOOTAGE from earlier.
Of Kate swathing through.
Everyone Stunned. Blades waning.

Footage pausing: On KATE & ANI.
Susumu stepping forth.
Roaring out grand injunction to all.

SUSUMU
Send out this picture. Inform everyone. The smaller families. The police. Everyone we tax. All the hostesses and dealers. This is our city. We have eyes and ears everywhere. They can’t take a breath without us hearing it. And when we find them, they won’t take any more. It’s a matter of honor now. We will be dishonored without retribution. We’ll lose the ground we stand on, and get tossed in the wind. That cannot happen!

‘Hai!’. All bowing fiercely.


GOLDEN GAI

City block cut by 6 narrow alleys, narrower passageways.
Exploding with 300 shanty-style bars/restaurants.
Kate and Ani pushing through the morass.
Past staggering salarymen, drunk and satiated.
Ground slick with cooking-fat and piss.
Air thick with smoke from yakitori grills.

ANI
I’m hungry!

YAKITORI BAR. NEXT MINUTE

Kate dropping bills.
Getting handed chicken-heart skewers.
Passing half to Ani.
Chomping into rest, grease oozing.

KATE
I’ve got to go see someone now.

ANI
Are you going to come back for me?

KATE
Just-- stay here.






 
76.


ANI
Wait! Give me your number. In case of emergency.

KATE
I’m not your bloody mother.

Ani taken aback. Hurt. Swallowing hard.
Kate sighs, unlocks her cell, forks it over.

ANI
Kakkoiiiii!
(thumbing in her info)
Want me to charge it? 22%, it’s
gonna die soon.

Kate absorbing this... ‘Leave it.’ Ani shrugs, sending herself a text.

ANI (CONT’D)
Got you! What’s your--

KATE
Kate.

Ani mouthing as she plugs it in.
Returning Kate’s cell. Grinning as...
It chirps with an OVERTLY CUTE ringtone.

ANI
My personal ringtone! So you know
when I’m calling.

Kate pocketing it, telling Ani to,

KATE
Stay here till I get back.

Involuntary regard. Surprising both.
Ani salutes with her cellphone.
A CUSTOMER watches Kate exit, sends a text.

ALLEYWAYS

Kate’s pace quickening to a gallop.
Cutting left, right, left, hectic.
Through time-warped tumble of bars.
Stripping last bite, tossing skewers.
WINCING. Ducking into,

CONVENIENCE STORE

Storming across. Scanning shelves.
Reaching for water. Last second--






 
77.


Grabbing handle of BOURBON instead.
Unscrewing cap one-handed. Swigging.
Bills tossed on counter. Gone.


A DOG LICKS A BLOODY FACE

Sprawled CORPSE of a Yakuza kobun.
TWO MORE angrily aim .45’s at Kate.
 

ANGRY KOBUN #1
She just hit him and he--
 


ANGRY KOBUN #2
You killed him, you bitch!

 

Kate just gulps bourbon, drunk-sways.

KATE
Kishikawa. I’m looking for--
(hiccup-points)
Are you Kishi-- You Kishikawa?

One pats her down. She squirm-giggles.
No weapons. He snatches the bourbon.
She takes it right back.

KATE (CONT’D)
No! Mine!

Drinks. Burps. Giggles.
They blink.

GOLDEN GAI KARAOKE

Black-suited Yakuza occupying main room.
Spread out on mats, drinking. Drunk.
One howls along to The Ramones’s Blitzkrieg Bop in Japanese.

As the duo shoves Kate in.
She drunk-staggers, clutching bottle.
One bows to a MAN sitting aside,

ANGRY KOBUN #1
This drunk yariman keeps asking
about you. She just killed Ryoji!

KATE
You-- you’re Kishikawa then?

KISHIKAWA watches her slug the bourbon.

KISHIKAWA
Who is this gaijin whore?

And Kate starts POURING it on him.
DOUSING him. Just like that.






 
78.


Everyone instantly on their feet, roaring.
Adjoining doors SLIDING open, more Yakuza.
Kate SPARKING lighter next to his SOAKED face.
Icing everyone in their tracks.
