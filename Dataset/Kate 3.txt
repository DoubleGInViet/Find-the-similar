KATE
You hired me to kill the Minister’s
Aide.

KISHIKAWA
(wiping his eyes)
What?!

KATE
You arrange and accommodate all
hits for the Sumiyoshis, yes?

KISHIKAWA
I-- What?

KATE
Next time I won’t repeat the
question.

Lowers the flame to his eyes.
He squirms, squeezing them shut.

KATE (CONT’D)
Your department handles the
contractors, yes or no?

KISHIKAWA
Yes, yes, but--

KATE
Then you had me poisoned. Why?

KISHIKAWA
No-- Sumiyoshi did not contract
this, I promise to you!

Yakuza encircling. Blades up. Tightening.
Kate unconcerned. Yanking him by his hair.

KATE
Then who?

KISHIKAWA
Don’t know-- I-- maybe Kozakura.

KATE
I was put up in your hotel, I was
poisoned in your hotel.







 
79.


KISHIKAWA
Please! I promise we only take the girl-- the daughter, we kidnap her to make deal but he was killed before he arrived.

Kate pausing. A dead-end. Confusion...
Her SHOULDER TWITCHES. Flame jerked, flitting.
Everyone shifting, coiling. Kishikawa’s eyes darting.
Kate RE-SPARKING. Thrusting it at his face.

KATE
Name and address.

KISHIKAWA
What? I’m sorry I--

KATE
Kozakura, their oyabun, man up top.

Her ARM TREMORING, CONVULSION coming on.
Kishikawa feeling the heat. Literally.

KISHIKAWA
Susumu! His name is Susumu! He--

MUSCLE CRAMP DISLODGING her shoulder.
Lighter hitching loose...
SWOOSH! LIGHTING UP Kishikawa.

An explosion of yells. Movement.
Kate tearing a Glock off one.
Blitzkrieg Bop hijacking our audio.
Punctuating the ensuing mayhem.

BACK AT YAKITORI BAR

Yakuza bursting in, startling everyone.
Ani bolting for the rear exit.
Snatched by more men entering there.
Getting hauled off, SCREAMING.
No one in the place moving a muscle.

OUTSIDE GOLDEN GAI KARAOKE

Passerbys reacting to carnage echoing from within.
WHAM! A Yakuza smashes through.
Clamping throat, gurgling, takes a step, collapses.
Another runs out on fire.
KRAK! Doesn’t get very far.

Out stumbles Kate.
Blood drenched demon from hell.
SNAPPING her arm back into place, ROARING.






 
80.


Stepping over corpses.
Onlookers giving her a wide berth.
As she shoves past.

YAKITORI BAR

Kate stands blinking at empty seat.
Ani not there.
A moment...
Then pain thrusts.
Kate grimacing.
Lurching out.

ALLEYWAY

Swaying, dizzy. Slamming into wall.
Trying to hold on. Sliding down it.
Field of vision a milky BLUR.
Colors dulling, bleeding into next.
Struggling through near blindness.
Patting herself down.
Freeing NSAIDs tube from pocket.
Slugging it straight.
Shut-eye swallow.
Heartbeat THUDDING...

CLUSTER OF BLACK SUVS

Yakuza hustling Ani towards one.
Mouth muffled, squirming mad.
More Yakuza emerging, one on his cell:

YAKUZA
We’ve got the kid, the woman’s here somewhere. We’re locking the whole place down, she’s not getting out.

Ani biting hand covering her mouth.

ANI
Chikusho! She’s my new gaijin mom
and she’s going to kill you all!

Getting SLAPPED for it.
SIRENS ebbing closer...

ALLEYWAY

...Kate opening her eyes.
Vision less hazy.
Still plagued by bleached flares.
People regarding her with horror.
Whipping back as she springs up.
Pitches forward.






 
81.


YAKUZA/COPS FORTIFYING GOLDEN GAI

Cars SCREECHING up, bodies SWARMING.
Flocks of Yakuza/cops, eyes EVERYWHERE.
Exits blocked. Escape impossible.

Kate tottering past shanties.
Blanching in severe pain.
Calculating her window when,

ANI (O.S.) (CONT’D)
KATE!!!

Peeks over her shoulder.
Sees Ani getting shoved into SUV.
Wriggling, kicking the door.
Their eyes locking...
Yakuza noticing her, shouting over.
Kate glancing back towards street.
No getting out if she goes back in...

Yakuza converging fast.
Kate deciding, scrambling towards street.
Abandoning Ani.
Kid realizing she’s deserted.
Nascent trust in Kate shaken.

ALLEY

Yakuza bombing out after Kate.

SUV

Ani sandwiched in the rear.
All swagger evaporated.
Exposing the 13-year old she is.
Shaking with complete despair.
Full-on wailing as the SUV rolls out.

Yakuza barks, lifting arm for another slap--
KRAK! Window implodes, his head snapping.
KRAK! The other one getting pulped.
Blood spritzing Ani. SCREAMING, as--
KRAK! Driver’s skull splits.
SUV banging pavement.
Passenger Yakuza opening door.
KRAK! KRAK! KRAK! Mozambique drill.
He spills through open door.

Ani stops screaming, gawks up.
Kate there, smoking gun.
Hero shot: Etched against the sky.
All torn and bleeding of course, there’s that.
Lifts weapon off corpse and winces at Ani,






 
82.


KATE
Move.


SPRINT THROUGH GOLDEN GAI

Claustrophobic maze. A riot of neon.
Kate and Ani dashing through.
Hunted by Yakuza army.
Gunfire. Slashing blades.
No time to think.
Stop and they die.
Breathless, jarring. Dizzy.
A staccato blur of violence.
Avoid motion-sickness, switch to,

OVERHEAD VIEW

Of them GRINDING through shanties into,

STRIP CLUB

A sex club like a Bosch painting.
Cyberpunk strippers. Nude chocolate wrestling.
Curtained STALLS lining back wall.
They duck into one as the Yakuza enter.

PRIVATE STALL

Heaving. Caked in grime.
Ani hyperventilating bad,

ANI
Too many-- there’s-- they’re gonna kill us, they’re- Kuso! Kuso! Kuso!

KATE
Shhh. Close your eyes, breathe,
think of blue.
(snaps fingers, harder)
Hey, picture the color blue.

A	breather...
Doesn’t last.
A	HOSPITALITY GIRL whisks the curtain. Evicting them in flurry of nasal Japanese. Yakuza henchmen bolting over.

The duo rushing out the back.

KABUKICHO DISTRICT

Into crowded entertainment district.
Shatei everywhere, scanning pedestrians.
Ani hooking arm around Kate’s waist.






 



ANI
Act drunk. You’re a freaky drunk gaijin and I’m your whore.

Kate glancing disapproval.
Ani spitting belligerence.

ANI (CONT’D)
What? You’re not my mom.

Suddenly weighed down, wobbling.

ANI (CONT’D)
Kuu-sooo! I said act drunk, not be
drunk.

Notices Kate grimacing, eyes aflutter.
Shoulder DROOPING, arm out of socket again.

ANI (CONT’D)
Ohfuckdon’tdiedon’tdiedon’t--

Abrupt SHOUTS of ‘Bakayaro!’.
Four Yakuza RUSHING them with blades.
Ani SHRIEKING. Kate SMACKING the ground.
Pair GASHING into her.
Other HAULING Ani off screaming.

Kate coasting on muscle-memory.
And one arm.
Anyone else would be dead twice over...


SPECIALIST (V.O.)
You won’t see the sunrise.

...Kate’s late for her reprisal.
Ignores slashes, puts down the men.
And gets herself parallel to wall.
Ani now way in the distance...
More Yakuza rushing in between.

Concern hardening into anger. Pats herself down, LAST VIAL. Swills it straight. Grabs arm, CRACK! Bangs it back in place. Doesn’t even wince.

Just takes off after Ani.
Full-pelt. A locomotive.

WHAM! Car SLAMMING Kate, upending her.
SCREECHING to a stop.
 

83.







































A MEMORY SPASM:

 





 
84.


But Kate’s back up, already hobbling on.
Driver gawking...

OBSERVED FROM AFAR

By BLACK-CLAD FIGURES.
Sheltered by shadows.
Pulling on balaclava masks.
Stalking towards Kate.

SENTO BATHHOUSE

Yakuza run and populated.
Lounging tattooed flesh.
A pair hustling Ani in.
Through to the BACK OFFICE.

Door flying open again.
Kate, grimy Totoro shirt.
One-by-one they all stand.
FLINCH as she brings up gun.
Deflating as it CLICKS dry.
Kate with an eye-sigh.
Before they rush her.

She moves, snatching hand-towel.
Twirling it into tight rat-tail.
Dipping tip in water, SNAPS it like a whip.
Firecracker POP, EXPLODES an eyeball.
Man goes down clutching face.

Another STABS. She whips it around his wrist.
Straightens his arm. Three rapid punches.
Shoulder, elbow, wrist. Shattered. Down.
As Kate’s choke-holed from behind.
Flips it overhead, around his throat.
Loosens, then SNAPS, vertebrae and trachea POP.

Wraps it around her hand next.
SMASHES beer bottle, grabbing shard.
SLICING another’s wrist to the bone.
Arterial blood PUMPS. Another down.

She keeps on. Energizer bunny.

BACK OFFICE

Nervous shatei bark into phones.
Ani sobs, fresh bruise fading on cheek.
KNOCK on door. Looks traded.
Knuckles whitening around guns.

CIGARETTE YAKUZA
Who is it?






 
85.


Another knock in response.
Everyone tensing, on edge.
Gun up, the smoker inches over.
Opens door: Kate’s there.
Takes gun off him. Just like that.
He blinks at empty hand.
Trigger finger missing, bone protrudes.

CIGARETTE YAKUZA (CONT’D)
AHHHHHH!!!

Explosion of epithets. Guns cocking.
Too late.
Kate flies in. Kills them all.
Adding fresh coat of gore to room.
Ani rushes. Hugs her. Squeezes tight.
Lathered face. Tears of joy.

ANI
You came back! You came back for
me! I was so scared I-- ohmygod!

Smitten. Doesn’t wanna let go.
Kate lets her.
Plucks cig off corpse. Pulls deep.
Before snatching a Serbu shorty shotgun,

KATE
Tired of saving you.

EXIT INTO BACK ALLEY

They step out and move.
SIRENS nearing fast.
Duo dashing between alleys, as--
TWO COP CARS SCREECH in from street.
Cig in mouth, Kate lets the shorty rip.
Doesn’t slow, doesn’t even look.

WHA-CHACK-CHACK-CHACK!
Windshields IMPLODING.
GLASS PEBBLING the Cops.
Shielding eyes, ducking, STOMPING GAS.
TIRES SQUEALING backwards in panic.
Our duo already gone. Turning,

ONTO CROWDED STREET

PFFT! PFFT! PFFT!
Silent rounds WHIZZING in.
PELTING wall above Kate’s head.
She drops, pulling Ani with her.
Seconds before more drill the spot.
Missing ‘em by this much.






 
86.


KATE (CONT’D)
Up. Move. Keep moving.

They zig-zag. Hectic. Divergent
Kate’s eyes darting.
Scanning the ROILING CROWDS.
Unable to spot,

THE ALBINO

Fusing in and out of the stampede.
Silenced Sig SPITTING.
Each shot from a new position.
Dropping empty, cycling out another.
Unrelenting. Closing in on,

KATE

Round PUNCHING shoulder.
Blood flecking Ani.
Shotgun slipping grasp.
No time to reclaim it.

ANI
You’re shot! You-- Who’s shooting?

Kate yanking her down roughly.
Second before bullets rip the spot.
Recalibrating. Shoving Ani forward.

KATE
Don’t look back. Two steps right,
one left. Keep moving.

ANI
What?

Kate just tugging her along.
Plowing through pedestrians.
PFFT! PFFT! PFFT!
One taking a bullet. Then another.
Blood misting the air.
Kate calculating, snapping a glimpse of,

THE ALBINO
Sig held waist-level.
Firing inconspicuously.
Eyes clasping for a second...

Kate pulling her gun.
SPASMING mid-move.
CONTRACTION obliterating her thigh.
She wobbles, COLLAPSING.
Pandemonium. Crowds stirring.






 
87.


Ani joining their SQUEALS.

KATE
Don’t stop! Keep moving, keep--

Ani frozen, immobilized by fear.
Bullets THWACKING all around.

KATE (CONT’D)
Turn around, move that way!

Kate wincing up, every ounce of strength.
One LEG PARALYZED, thigh SOAKED through.
Fist-sized open sore BUBBLING.
Struggles GIMP-LEGGED towards the kid.

KATE (CONT’D)
Go! I’ll cover you!

Ani snapping out, turning.
Just as, PFFT! PFFT! PFFT!
Rounds carve Kate’s side.
She stutters. Goes down again.
Gun skimming away.
Ani YELPING, rushing back.
A guttural bark,

KATE (CONT’D)
I said go! Keep moving!

New ingredient in her voice.
Emotion. Heated with concern.
Kid refusing, tear-glazed faced.

KATE (CONT’D)
Ani, stop! Turn around!

Crowds dissipated, Albino emerging.
Ani now taking Kate’s hand.
As Albino aims, dead-on...

PHUT! PHUT! PHUT! PHUT!
Tiny shuriken LODGE into his limbs.
EXPLODE without sound.
The Albino QUIVERS, drops gun.

FOUR FIGURES materialize behind him. All black. Balaclava masks. One grabs Albino’s face. Unceremoniously opens his throat. Another approaches Kate,

MASKED FIGURE
Show me your hands.






 
88.


TOKYO STREETS. LATER

TWIN BLACK SUVs navigate the neon wonderland.

FRONT SUV

Kate in the back. Hands zip-tied.
FLANKING FIGURES bear KRISS Vector SMGs.
LEAD FIGURE sits across.
Next to Ani, still dazed.
Everyone staring at Kate...

All simultaneously unmask.
All WOMEN. Stoic. Severe.
We’ve seen two of them.
The Lead speaks in academic English,

THE MIKO
I’m not going to ask who you are. Because I know what you are. You’ve set half our city on fire tonight.

KATE
I’ve seen you. At a murder scene.
Rifling a dead man’s pockets.

The Lead eyes the others, considers.
As recognition flits across Ani’s face.

THE MIKO
We are The Miko. Autonomous
Japanese intelligence. We keep
things manageable. And we do not
officially exist.

KATE
Don’t mind me, I’m almost done.

THE MIKO
Almost? It’s going to take a very
long time to put out these fires.

KATE
Maybe you can point me in the right direction then. Expedite this.

THE MIKO
What you want is not our concern.
Our concern is the ‘dead man’ and
what he had. So we can stop this
before the whole city burns down.

KATE
Dead man. Ani’s father.






 
89.


THE MIKO
He had evidence linking government officials to the Yakuza. Sending the two largest clans into panic. He was in hiding so the Sumiyoshis kidnapped his daughter to exchange for it. But he got killed en route.

Ani reacts, a million gears churning.

KATE
Who contracted the hit? Susumu?

THE MIKO
Kozakura boss, yes. To eradicate
the problem. Unaware that the
Sumiyoshis had also taken steps.

KATE
But you were shadowing the Aide.

THE MIKO
We couldn’t get to him in time. So we tried to secure the drive, and realized he didn’t actually have it. He’d given it to someone no one would think of. The only person he trusted.

Turns to Ani. Her eyes damp, swallowing.

THE MIKO (CONT’D)
Isn’t that right, Ani?

Ani shaking her head.

THE MIKO (CONT’D)
You’re a brave girl, Ani. Where did you hide it?

ANI
What are you going to do with it?

THE MIKO
We’re going to stop the bad people.

ANI
People that killed my dad?

THE MIKO
Yes.

ANI
Will they die?






 
90.


THE MIKO
In prison.

ANI
Kate can just kill them now.

THE MIKO
We can’t let her kill anymore, Ani-chan. Where is the drive?

ANI
I don’t have it.

Ani turning to Kate.
Kate intuiting.
Something wrong here...

THE MIKO
What do you mean? Where is it?

Going through her bag. Then phone.
Impatience swelling,

THE MIKO (CONT’D)
I am trying to help you.

ANI
I’ve seen you. And your kusobabaa boss. In my dad’s pictures. You’re one of the people he was exposing. People working with the Yakuza.

THE MIKO
You have me confused with someone
else, Ani-chan, look at me.

ANI
I’ve already seen you, you work for one of the bad guys.

Lead smiles. It never reaches her eyes.
Drops the facade and nods at Kate.

THE MIKO
And who do you think she is, a
‘good guy’?

Kate knows what’s coming.
Her eyes burgeoning with panic.

THE MIKO (CONT’D)
This gaijin killed your dad. That’s how she knows we were there, she’s the one who shot him.






 
91.


Ani walloped, her whole world rocked again.
Glaring at Kate, not wanting to believe.

ANI
Kate...

Kate trying to communicate ...something.
Doesn’t know how to.
We can’t see it, but her heart’s breaking.
Ani instantly knows it’s the truth.
Devastated. Spiraling.
Betrayal inducing tears.

THE MIKO
Don’t worry she’s going to pay for all of this. Just give it to me.

Ani toughening, shaking head.
Getting yanked by her hair.
SLAPPED. Hard.

THE MIKO (CONT’D)
Enough! Tell me now or I’ll have to
start hurting you.

Ani turning resilient. Like Kate.
Lead pulling back for another slap.

KATE
You hit her again, I’ll kill you.

Lead pauses.
SLAP! Makes Ani bleed.
Kate returns a hostile look.
Memorizing her face.
To do something medieval to it...

But VOMITS instead.
Spewing BLOOD all over the Lead.
Stunned for a moment.
Before she SOCKS Kate, CRUNCHING cartilage.

THE MIKO
I’ll make the kid pay for this.

She turns back to Ani.
And something growls.
Something infernal,

KATE
Shouldn’t have touched her.

THE MIKO
What the fuck are you going to do?






 
92.


Spins on Kate again.
Something off about her.
All eyes drifting down to...
Kate’s hands: free now.
Simultaneous reaction,

THE MIKO (CONT’D)
Oh shit...

Too late. Kate LAUNCHES --

DESERTED STREET

-- SUV SWERVES.
Careens wild. Overturns.
Skid-slamming the curb.

Smoke wafts. Dirt too.
Then, CRACK!
Windshield blows outward.
Kate waddles out.
KRISS Vector in hand.

SECOND SUV burning a fierce 180.
Donating it’s tires to the city.
Masked Miko leaning out.
Assault weapons aimed.

Kate unconcerned, limping towards back window.
SUV nigh. Gunfire imminent. 3, 2, 1--
When almost an afterthought,
Kate lifts the KRISS.
Razors the SUV.

60	rounds/sec. Punched like colander.
SUV fishtails, SKIDS past. Capsizes. Flames blossom, engulfing it.

Kate hasn’t even looked.
She’s peeking into the back window,

INVERTED SUV

Ani mashed in a corner.
Only one alive.
Angry, eye-spearing Kate.
Kate blinks back.
No words for this in her software.
Just extends her hand.

Ani ignores it.
Starts to say something.
Is overcome.
Just looks away, nostrils aflare.






 
93.


Kate withdrawing her hand
To cover mouth.
Brutal coughing fit.
She sways, woozy, reeling.
Clocking cell life: 9%
Sucks a breath, turns.
And limps off...

Ani squirms out after a moment.
Looks after Kate, seething.
Starts stumbling the other way...

When suddenly, a ROAR.
REV of a Ducati.
Here she comes,

THE PUNK

Thundering in.
Devil-horned helmet.
One-arming a BFR.

Kate whirls.
Sees Ani exposed in the middle.
Punk closing fast.
Doesn’t calculate, doesn’t think.
Just breaks into a peg-legged run.

KATE
Ani, get down!

Ani drops, as--
The Punk opens up.
BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!
BFR coughing thunder.
50 cal rounds BLOWING asphalt chunks.

Kate sprays the KRISS.
Punk veering into zig-zag.
Ani going fetal, HOWLING.
Bullets SPARKING all around.
Punk approaching fast.
Kate hobbling on one good leg.

Two forces of nature.
Thrashing towards each other.
Round GRAZING Kate’s gun arm.
She tosses it into the other.
Resumes fire.

Hits the Ducati
Sends it SKIDDING.
But the Punk’s rolled off.
Pulling second BFR.






 
94.


Kate hitting empty.
Still she persists.
Deranged kamikaze yell.
Round shaving her side.
Nevertheless, she persists.
But slower now.
In a zombie stagger.
One step, two, another.
Almost to Ani...

Punk striding up sans helmet.
Face-to-face.
She aims at Kate.
Lulls, something cruel twitching.
Bloody grin, pans gun to Ani.
Contorted into a shuddering ball.
BOOM!

Blood SPLOTCHES Ani’s face.
SHOVED outta the way.
Kate there instead.
Took the round through her shoulder.
Everyone stunned in that moment...

Except Kate.
Two lighting strides.
She’s already on the Punk.
Supinates an arm. Inverts a knee.
And SNAP! Breaks her neck.
The Punk drops dead.
Kate looms over, lungs heaving
Her back to Ani.

Ani wipes her eyes, uprights.
Watches Kate from behind.
Neither moves. Or says anything.
Just stand there.
Among corpses. Fire. Smoke. Blood.
SIRENS pulsing closer.

Beat. Beat. Beat...

Kate painfully lifts her arm sideways.
Ani rushes beneath it, hefting.
Supporting Kate.
The pair slowly waddling off...

RED-LIGHT DISTRICT

Tokyo’s ‘Sleepless Town’.
Hostess clubs. Love hotels.
They elbow through crowds.
Under lurid neon signs.
Ignoring the looks.






 
95.


ANI
I’m hungry, gaijin.

MCDONALD’S

Flopped in a booth.
Mound of fast food between them.
Ani gorges breathlessly.
Kate gnawing sluggish.
Reaches for soda cup and GRIMACES,
VARRICK’S SIGNATURE TOAST:

VARRICK (V.O.)
Anything worth cherishing, oughta
be cherished with the best company.

Pulls out the Lafite instead.
Miraculously intact.
Pops cork.
Dumps out soda.
Refills cup with the wine.
Ani looks up to see Kate watching.
In her eyes, something simmers.
Ani scowls.

ANI
What’s your problem? Weirdo.

Kate averts calmly.
Swirls, inhales.
Sips the century’s most expensive vintage.
Out of a styrofoam cup.

STREETS. LATER

They totter beneath the neon.
Kate lugging large ice bags.
Notices something, pauses.
Hands off bags to Ani.

ANI (CONT’D)
Kuu-sooo! What the hell!

KATE
Stay here and count to a 100, I’ll be back before you finish.

And just walks off.
Ani gawking after.
Seeing her stalk into a LOVE HOTEL.
Clutch of cars outside.
Cars we recognize.
THE KOREANS’ rides.
Ani slowly inches forward...






 
96.


Muted sounds emanate from within.
THUD. THUMP. CRACK. Muffled YELLS.
Sounds of commotion.
Death.
WHAM! Someone falls out the window.
Thrown out rather. A KOREAN.
HAMMERS into a Stinger’s roof.
IMPACT flinching Ani.
Agitating the crowds.

Kate emerges a beat later.
Fresh blood dotting her face.

KATE (CONT’D)
I’m going to guess, 46? No way you counted past 50.

ANI
What were you doing?

KATE
Simplifying a problem. Before it
became one. Come on.

Grabs ice bags, shuffles on.

MANJO LOVE HOTEL ROOM

Garish neon strains through the window.
Ani sits on the bed blinking into,

THE BATHROOM

Kate tenderly peeling her clothes.
Wince-talking,

KATE (CONT’D)
Just need a few minutes. 30. I’ve
set the alarm on my cell. Poke me
if that doesn’t do the trick.

As Kate’s clothes come off.
Ani GASPS, breath catching.
Awed by the horror that is her body.

More corpse now than a living thing.

Sallow flesh. Seared. Blistered
Swollen slits gummed with blood.
Hematomas blooming yellow-black.
Scorch-marks mottled blue.
Contused punctures. Welts. Sores. Lacerations.
Wounds, old and new. All open, bubbling. Seeping.
A flayed map of agony. A disaster site.






 
97.


Bathtub full of ice and freezing water.
She painfully submerges herself.
Inhaling as she closes her eyes.

Ani now watches from doorway
This woman. A killer. A monster.
Her savior.

ANI
You’re a bad person.

KATE
I’m a bad person.

ANI
But you can change.

KATE
No time.

ANI
When did you become like this?

KATE
About your age.

ANI
Why?

KATE
Anger. Made the wrong choice. Gave myself to some people. Let them make me into this.

ANI
I know why you saved me. To make up for killing my dad.

KATE
Taking a life meant nothing to me.

ANI
And now?

KATE
We make the choices, get what we
deserve.

ANI
Punishment. And the person who did this to you, Susumu?

KATE
He’ll get what’s coming.






 
98.


ANI
You’re still going to go kill him?
The last thing you’ll do?

KATE
That’s how it works.

ANI
But-- You don’t have to anymore,
you can still change.

KATE
Give me a break, I’m at 6%.

ANI
What about me? Saving me won’t
bring back my dad.

KATE
I know.

ANI
None of it will make a difference.

KATE
I know.

ANI
I need your help, I have to go get the drive, for my dad.

KATE
Don’t be ridiculous, entire city’s hunting us.

ANI
But you’ll still go kill this man!

KATE
That’s my business.

ANI
Why save me then?!

KATE
You’re making me regret it.

ANI
You’re a bad person, you’re still a bad person.

KATE
We covered that.







 
99.


ANI
I thought you cared.

KATE
30 minutes. 30...

Kate trailing off.
Ani exasperated.
Watches her lapse into sleep.
Peers at Kate’s phone. Then hers.
And decides.

ASAKUSA CAPSULE HOTEL. LATER

Walls of SLEEPING CAPSULES.
Like a massive honeycomb.
Clear windowed single sleeping spaces.
Salarymen who’ve missed the last train.

LOBBY

Ani strides in with purpose.
Right upto the CLERK.

ANI
I just need to use the lockers.

Clerk nod-smiles, glancing down at,
Computer screen: Kate and Ani’s pic.
Forcibly smiles up again.
Points Ani towards the lockers.
Waits, then picks up phone.

LOVE HOTEL BATHROOM

Bathed in gaudy red neon.
Suffused with thick smog.
Veil of noxious GAS.
Kate still passed out in bathtub.

She’s not alone.
FIGURES in the mist.
Abnormal postures. Gas masks.

THE PRIESTESS looms over Kate.
Watching through demon-faced mask.
Slowly lifts left hand.
And SNAPS her fingers.

CAPSULE HOTEL LOCKER ROOM

Massive wall of LOCKERS.
Ani whips out her cellphone.
...And snaps a selfie.






 
100.


Not a social media update.
Cell has facial recognition.
She points the phone, hits SEND.
Text triggers computerized lock.
A locker door POPS open overhead

Ani ascends attached ladder towards it.
Comes down with a Hello-Kitty bag.
Sifting as she heads to the exit.
Doesn’t get there.
BUMPING right into someone.
Looks up to see a grinning:

CHAPATSU
You’re coming with us, warugaki.

KATE’S CELL BUZZES

Lying atop her begrimed clothes.
Hand reaches, turns off alarm.
But we’re not in the bathroom.
And Kate’s not in the bathtub.

Dangles like a bell in STRAPPADO BONDAGE.
Arms above her head, from behind her back.
Feet off the ground, weighed down by SANDBAGS.
Bent forward. Excruciating.

In THE PRIESTESS’ DUNGEON.
Appropriately named,

JIGOKU

Dark. Scarce ambient light.
Somewhere out-of-tune VIOLINS SCREECH.
Awakening Kate. She tries to orient.
But nothing makes sense.

DEVILISH FACES in the gloom.
Hunched WORKERS in wicked Hannya masks.
Necks chain-leashed to walls.
ROPE-BINDING Kate in intricate S&M patterns.
Torturous Kinbaku techniques.

THE PRIESTESS conducts in silhouette.
Ornate shears in her hand.
Behind her, a Katana-wielding SAMURAI ARMOR.
It’s Kabuto helmet modified to horned gasmask.

THE PRIESTESS
Bondage often leads to real freedom if you allow it to.

She drifts towards Kate.






 
101.


Illegible accent, offbeat cadence.

THE PRIESTESS (CONT’D)
I do not care for a measly
contract. I am an artiste.

(runs shears across Kate) You shall have the honor of being subject to a masterwork of misery.

Snaps her fingers.
Workers start CLENCHING the ropes taut.
Tighter. Tighter. Tighter...
Kate blanching, suffocated, body CONTORTING.
In bizarre, serpentine web of rope bondage.
And knots of IVs threaded into veins.
Unable to move. Or speak.
Eyes inflating with horror.

THE PRIESTESS (CONT’D) The drugs have seized you. Poisons, sustaining your pain, and pleasure. Your synapses will misfire, there will be sensory glitches, it will heighten everything.

Tighter: Kate trembling with ineffable anguish.

THE PRIESTESS (CONT’D) This is pain you do not understand. The ropes are twisting your bones, disfiguring you, accenting the suffering to an ethereal degree.

Noises radiate from somewhere.
MOANS. SCREAMS. All indiscernible.

THE PRIESTESS (CONT’D) You must maintain a steady heart-rate, even as the pain becomes unbearable. One wrong move, even a sharp exhale, and you fracture a 100 bones at once.

Tighter: Kate’s breath RASPY, sawing in/out.
Tighter: Tears flaring turgid eyes.

THE PRIESTESS (CONT’D) Brink of death, one foot in the void. No one has come this far. It is where you must remain, my pet. Until this misery becomes euphoric.

Scoops loaded SYRINGE off a table.
Sinks it into her own cubital vein.






 
102.


Mouth curving lasciviously.
Aroused whisper,

THE PRIESTESS (CONT’D)
Fear is a potent aphrodisiac.

Kate lost in a whirlpool of pain. Eyes burnishing with KALEIDOSCOPIC,
MEMORY FLASHES

All the lives she’s taken.
Every. Brutal. Assault.
Never ending.
The Priestess out of her qipao.
Her body a canvas of hurt.
Of abhorrent, eccentric self-abuse.
One leg mauled, tattooed over.
Milky eye fluttering,

THE PRIESTESS (CONT’D)
This undiluted agony, it is more
glorious than I imagined.

KILLS STILL FLASHING

EACH ONE JOLTING HER WITH NEW PAIN.
BLOW BY BLOW. KILL BY KILL.
DELIVERING HER COMEUPPANCE.

KATE (V.O.)
We get what we deserve.

Another body in the gloom now.
THE SERF. Face tattooed like the Maori.
Rope-binding The Priestess herself.

THE PRIESTESS
You are being liberated from your body. To be revived in a new form.

Kate sinking in a quicksand of memories,
SHORT-CIRCUITING

KID KATE bloodsoaked and angry.
HELLO-KITTY waving in neon.
ANI bloodsoaked and angry.

Priestess quaking with pleasure. Pain.

THE PRIESTESS (CONT’D)
Stay, my pet. We’re almost there...

But Kate’s gone catatonic.
Her light going out...
Dim...
Dimmer...
BLACK.






 
103.


Flatline.

Priestess silent. Bound chest heaving.
Watching Kate through cloudy eye...

KATE IN DARKNESS...

Suddenly from within it,
A silly JINGLE. Familiar...
A beacon.
A MEMORY STAB

Ani holding out her phone.

ANI (V.O.)
In case of emergency...

Her phone bleeping with ANI’S RINGTONE.
Kate’s pulse SPIKES.
Ani sobbing.

ANI (V.O.)
My dad, they killed my dad...

Another surge, her fingers TWITCH.
Ani screaming.

ANI (V.O.)
Kate!!!

WRENCHING Kate back to life.
Literally.
Her eyes SLAM open.
Bloodshot.
She’s SCREAMING. HOWLING.
CONVULSING. Through the pain.
CRACK!
Her ARM DISLOCATING again.
LOOSENING within the bounds.
Body WARPING unnaturally.

The Priestess snapping fingers.
The Serf retracting a step.
As she SHEARS herself out of the restrains.

Kate’s eyes welding to hers.
Vision oscillating violently.
Between reality and hallucinogenic hell.
Priestess appearing a fiery hellion.

Kate MUMBLING inaudibly.
Priestess inching in close.

THE PRIESTESS
Let me moisten these.






 
104.


To Kate’s parched lips.
She licks them. Lingers there.

THE PRIESTESS (CONT’D)
What was that, my pet?

Kate weakly opens her mouth.
Priestess brings up her face.
And Kate BITES OUT HER JUGULAR.
TEARS it right out.
Priestess SPASMING.
Shears in her hand SLICING rope and flesh.
Kate RIPPING her arm free.
Snatching the shears.

Priestess stunned, staggering back.
GAGGING. CHOKING. WHEEZING.
Clutching throat.
Blood HISSING through fingers.

Sending everyone into a frenzy.
Workers BUCKING against their leashes.
Serf rushing to The Priestess.

As Kate SPITS out the throat.
Three rapid CUTS to her binds.
She THUDS to the ground.

Serf failing to stifle the rupture.
Priestess’ gaze still lasered on Kate.
Pleased smile breaking her lips.
She dies content.

Serf throwing LATCH on wall.
Chain-leashes SNAPPING loose.
Lights PULSING. Alarms WAILING.

Workers blitzing Kate en masse.
On her feet now.
Plucking katana off samurai armor.
Facing them one-handed.
A lightning flurry of SLASHES.
Too quick to register.
They die where they stood.
Collapsing in geysers of gore.

Kate slamming Serf against wall.
Hammering shears into gagging mouth.
Like a railroad spike, THUNK!
Pinning him to wall, CRACKING from impact.
SPIDERWEBBING out. Real or optical glitch?

Body deteriorated, Kate WOBBLES.
SPRAWLING helpless on the floor...






 
105.


DING of text messages.
Cellphone atop pile of her clothes.
Frayed breaths, she looks over.
And starts elbowing towards it.
COMMOTION rumbling outside.

Kate reaching the cell.
Life: 1%
Text from Ani,

ANI’S TEXT
I went to get the drive and the
Yakuza kidnapped me (;_;)

Note: Japanese emoticons are upright unlike US counterparts.

ANI’S TEXT (CONT’D)
I decided I didn’t want to become like you. Wanted to make the right choice (._.)

Scrolls to the last one.

ANI’S TEXT (CONT’D) I don’t know where I am but I’m scared (O_O) I’m sorry I was angry. Will you come rescue me again Kate?

Kate types back.

KATE’S TEXT
Don’t be sorry. I’ll be right
there.

Pauses. Adds her first emoticon.

KATE’S TEXT (CONT’D)
:)

Sends the text and looks around.
Gaze settling on the table.
FOUR SYRINGES arrayed on it.
Loaded with who-knows what.
No other options, she squirms over.
Palms all four. GRIPS ‘em tight.
Inhales...

And STABS them into her femoral.
MASHING the plungers.
Nothing happens...
Steel door RATTLING.
BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG!

Suddenly her eyes UNDULATE.






 
106.


Body ROCKED by the drug soup.
Flooding her system.
She THRASHES, then goes still...
Cellphone finally going dark. Dead.

BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG!

A FINGERNAIL scratches feebly.
TOES shift, seeking purchase.
A HAND plants itself.
TEETH bared, a rictus of pain.
Rising up, standing.
Reaches full height.
SNAPS the arm in place.
And it has a name again,

KATE

Stands reborn. Bloody. Demonic.
Senses surging, heightened.
Vision see-sawing, eyes ticking.
Through a phantasmagoric inferno.
Kicks open crate, GAS CANISTERS inside.
Looks up at the SAMURAI ARMOR...

OUT IN THE HALLWAY

Throbbing lights and alarms.
HORDE outside the door.
Leather-garbed, head-to-toe.
Bearing hatchets, bolos, hammers.

WHAM! Door ruptures and STEEL QUIVERS.
Torquing bodies in DETONATIONS OF GORE.
CANISTERS roll out through heap.
GAS-BOMBING the hallway.

Before she emerges...
Devilish gasmask atop soaked armor.
Katana flexed in her grip.
A roaring, nightmarish vision of hell.

KATE
I’m coming, Ani!

Senses peaking, vision fluctuating.
Between real and surreal.
Everything distorted, warped.
Or not. Impossible to tell here.
Macabre figures lunge.
Katana sings, down they go.
In SPURTS of viscera.
Kate cleaves through.
Leaving them smeared on floor.






 
107.


Gunfire FLARES, streaking the soot.
Rounds lacerate flesh, she howls.
Wrangles gun, returns the gift.
RIBBONING the onslaught. Manic now, feral.

KATE (CONT’D)
Just hold on!

Sordid CHAMBERS line hallway.
Twisted eyesores FLOODING OUT.
Real or phantasms, menacing all the same.
Kate hacks through unhinged.
In a frenzy. Deranged. Delirious.

KATE (CONT’D)
I’m coming, baby, I’m--

Argh! Brutal GASHES. Quarting blood.
Would put down an African elephant.
Only make her angrier.
She churns through the vile vertigo.
Accented through her perception.

Emerges half standing.
Assembled eyes tracking her:
A blood-soaked beast. Primordial. Elemental.
Facing a parade of grotesqueries.
Impossible odds.
She stares them down.
Sunken eyes. Shot through with red.
We glimpse the demon in there.
It growls. They take a step back.

It gets biblical.

DARK DESERTED ALLEY

Concealing heavy steel door.
Entrance to Jigoku.
Dead silent. Sound-proof door.

RUSSIAN TWINS working on it.
Fresh corpses at their feet.
Door unbolts with a CLUNK.
Opening into darkness.
Faint noises echo from within.
One brings up gun, enters.
We stay out with the other.
Standing lookout.
Growing impatient...

First one finally staggers back out.
Takes a step, face plants.
Claw-end of hammer jutting from skull.






 
108.


The other Twin SPINS and,
Click! A gun prods his forehead.
His eyes expanding at the bearer.

YOYOGI PARK. NIGHT

After-hours empty.
VARRICK pacing alone.
Irritated, checking watch, cell.
Pauses when he hears RUSTLING.
Russian Twin stumbles from the gingko trees.

VARRICK
It’s against protocol, meeting like this. What is it?

Twin corkscrews to the ground. Revealing:

VARRICK (CONT’D)
KATE. Oh Christ.

Elated, hastening towards her.

KATE
Stay there.

Varrick stops and gawks.
Looks like she went 20 rounds with a mountain lion.
Or four.
An upright corpse.

VARRICK
Let me take you to the hospital,
Kate, you don’t have to go like
this, don’t have to die in pain!

KATE
That’s precious. I just killed a
man you sent to kill me.

VARRICK
Firm rules, nothing I could do. Forget that now, let me take you to the hospital, we’ll avoid the guns.

KATE
There’s no avoiding the guns.

VARRICK
What can I do? Anything, I’ll--
just tell me!

KATE
I need intel.






 
109.


Argh! Kate ROARING in anguish.
Violent CONVULSION.
Entire body caught in eruption.
VARRICK’S EMOTIONS CRESTING.

VARRICK
Whatever you want to know! Just--

KATE
Need to find someone.

Varrick at the boiling point.
Frothing over. Enough!

VARRICK
Who?! This has nothing to do with
the Yakuza! The Firm killed you,
Kate! It was their call, it was--

KATE
You. You administered the poison.

His silence confirming it.
Tears pearling his eyes.

VARRICK
Yesterday in Berlin. No one else
could get close enough to you.

BERLIN CAFE

Kate and Varrick toasting, sharing wine.

KATE
Why?

VARRICK
What you said, no one retires. It was supposed to hit after the job. The poison. Quick and clean. But...

Genuine hurt on his face.
Hers too.

KATE
So they wouldn’t even have to look me in the eyes. After what they’ve made me. Well take a good look.

VARRICK
It was the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do.

KATE
And the money, my severance?






 
110.


VARRICK
Contingent upon you being alive. Unless it’s transferred outta those accounts, it all reverts back to The Firm when you expire.

KATE
I’ve not expired yet.

Another brutal SURGE.
Kate one-knees the ground.
Face flush with pain and tears.
Varrick fighting back his own.

VARRICK
I don’t care now, Kate, just let me get you help, let me-- there are drugs, treatments, we can make the pain disappear!

Kate coming undone through gritted teeth,

KATE
How the hell do you make the pain disappear? I’ve got an hour left. How do you make that pain disappear, Varrick? Tell me. Tell how you do that and I’ll let you. Tell me how you make it go-- how I make the knowledge that I’m gonna die having only ever been what they made me, a killer, a monster, a-- how do I make that disappear? How do I wipe that clean? I’ve got a fucking hour, how do I wipe it clean!? Tell me and I’ll-- Argh!

Spasms wracking her body.
Clenching and constricting.
Struggling through the tremor.
Pain echoing over the silence...

VARRICK
I take responsibility for this, you hear me? I accept the punishment!

KATE
I don’t want revenge.

Corrals herself, gets vertical.

KATE (CONT’D)
Not anymore. One hour, just need to do one thing.






 
111.


VARRICK
What’s that?

KATE
Save a life. Little girl. Man I killed, his daughter, they’ve taken her. I need to know where.

VARRICK
Why?

KATE
Firm knows everything happening in the city. Tell me or I hurt you.

VARRICK
Listen to me, for Christ’s sake, I don’t want anymore pain for you, just-- do away with me, give me my due! I want my comeuppance!

KR-KRAK! Blown kneecaps.
Varrick heaps with a shriek.
Grunts it all out,

VARRICK (CONT’D)
They’ve meeting tonight, the entire Kozakura clan, compound in Marunouchi, they’ve got her there. You can’t take on all of them, Kate, not like this, you can’t take on all of the Yakuza!

Kate recedes a step, darkness gathering on her.

KATE
You have weaponry in the trunk?

VARRICK
It doesn’t matter now, Kate, saving a life. It won’t change anything.

KATE
I know. Keys.

He fumbles them out.

VARRICK
Then why?

KATE
There’s still time for her.

As she snatches ‘em,






 
112.


VARRICK
Wait, don’t leave me here, please, kill me, just-- do me this favor.

Kate lulls...
Pulls notepad from his pocket.

KATE
After you do something for me.

MARUNOUCHI SKYLINE

Steel and glass monoliths against the night.
Tokyo’s central commercial district.

THE KOZAKURA COMPOUND

One of the cold, dark gargantuans. 32 stories.

19TH FLOOR HALLWAY

Two shatei march through, bursting into,

SPARE ROOM

Startling ANI, she screams, runs.
Tall one kicks her down, yanks her hair.

TALL YAKUZA
She wasn’t there, you lying little bitch!

Short one notices her cell on the floor.
Grabs it and scrolls the texts.
Taps the other’s shoulder, displaying it.
Tall one reads, then orders.

TALL YAKUZA (CONT’D)
Tell Susumu-san we won’t have to
look for the gaijin anymore.
(grins at Ani)

You’re useless now. You get thrown in with the other underaged whores.

DOCTOR’S OFFICE

Low-rent. After hours.
Kate sits on the desk. Gun in lap.
Nervous DOCTOR administering a shot.

DOCTOR
This will overwhelm the pain from the poison, maybe for an hour. But it will bring it’s own discomfort.






 
113.


KATE
Make it a double then.

DOCTOR
This is impossible!

KATE
I can feel myself going, Doc. I
won’t last without another boost.

DOCTOR
Thebaine at this dosage is itself a poison. You will experience convulsions, seizures, your spinal column will curve on itself. The pain will literally paralyze you!

KATE
Just give it to me.

He regards her, states softly.

DOCTOR
Death by asphyxiation or exhaustion is certain within the hour.

Kate swallows. Digests.

DOCTOR (CONT’D)
Please. Take the lesser dose.

KATE
It won’t get me to her.

He eyes her gun.

DOCTOR
Are you not a bad person?

Kate considers...

KATE
Not tonight.

DOCTOR
Please, you will never survive the greater dose! What am I doing?!

KATE
Helping someone try to save a
little girl’s life.

And maybe my soul...
Doctor’s heart breaking for this woman,






 
114.


DOCTOR
I can give you NSAIDs to counteract the trismus, some pain. But not the seizures. This dose will mean your end. And it will hurt like hell.

Kate locking eyes with him.

KATE
She’s worth it.

MATSUYA DRESSING ROOM

Kate stands before mirror, eyes ablaze.
Fire coursing through her insides
Neck and chin quivering visibly.
Emptying NSAIDs down her gullet.

She slides on fresh clothes.
With painstaking precision.
Jeans. Shirt. Pea coat.
Clicks open weapons case.
Conceals everything tactically.
Perfect outfit. Her armor.
Looks down at piece of paper.
Blood smudged. Numbers on it.
Scrawls something at bottom.
Folds it into coat pocket.

Then adds a flourish.
Tacking accessory to collar.
A colorful Totoro pin.
Final glance in the mirror.
And she’s gone.

THE KOZAKURA COMPOUND

LOBBY thronged with black-suited Yakuza.
Horde outside visible through glass entrance.
Smoking, joking, laughing over the muzak...

VROOM!

A CAR SCREECHES towards entrance.
Gaining speed, PLOWING through bodies.
WHAM! EXPLODING into the lobby.
Scattering them like bowling pins.
THUDDING into the elevator bank.

Yakuza regaining bearings.
Yanking guns, aiming.
Soot obscuring backseat.
GASOLINE JERRYCANS stacked there.
One realizes it’s rigged, yells,






 
115.


SHATEI
Matte!

Too late. Everyone unloads.
WHOOM! Car ERUPTS.
Scene turns FUZZY, becomes,

A MONITOR DISPLAY

As sprinklers cut through the smog.

SECURITY LEAD
We have a breach! Get the boss out of the meeting room and in here! Go! Now!

A shatei hustles out of the vast,

SECURITY HUB, 28TH FLOOR

Wall of monitors. Live security cams.
Half a dozen TECHS manning them.
SECURITY LEAD hovers over, scanning.
Squints at the lobby cam:
A vague silhouette coasting past...
He snaps up the radio, barks.

SECURITY LEAD (CONT’D)
Security check. All teams, report!

DIFFERENT VOICES OVER RADIO 1 check. 2 check. 3 check. 4 check.
5 check. 6 Check.
(pause)
8 check. 9 check. 10 check.

SECURITY LEAD
Team 7, status?

Silence.

SECURITY LEAD (CONT’D)
Where’s Team 7? Show me!

Tech click/points at a display:
Empty command post, no one there.
Lead tilts forward, taps screen:
Sprawled corpse, only a leg visible.

SECURITY LEAD (CONT’D)
She’s inside! What floor is that?

TECH
3rd floor.






 
116.


ANOTHER TECH
Teams 8 and 9 are down too!

Lead spins.
Displays show only bodies.
Corpses.
And it doesn’t stop.
 

TECH
Team 10 just went-- and 6--
 


ANOTHER TECH (CONT'D)
Team 4 also!

 

SUSUMU getting escorted in.
Gleaning the mania.

SUSUMU
What’s happening?
 

SECURITY LEAD
She’s inside the building, oyabun.

SUSUMU
Where?

SECURITY LEAD
We-- we don’t know.

TECH
Teams 3 and 5 are down too, sir.

SECURITY LEAD
These are 10-man teams! How is she moving so fast, where is she?!

TECHS
We don’t see her anywhere.

SUSUMU
She’s not a ghost, find her!

Eyes sweeping monitors.
Only seeing aftermaths:
Corpses smattered around.

SECURITY LEAD
There!

Pointing out corner display:
Yakuza going down pell-mell.
One after the other.
A SPECTER in their midst.
Moving faster than thought.
Because she’s got no time left.
Vanishing before they see her.







 
117.


Everyone’s jaws sagging.
Brains scrambling to catch up with their eyes.

SECURITY LEAD (CONT’D) That’s the 14th floor. Call up the rest, form a barricade on the 30th, we’ll stop her there.

TECH
How many?

SECURITY LEAD
Everyone!

Susumu barks after,

SUSUMU
Bring up the girl, too.

SPARE ROOM, 19TH FLOOR

Ani sits exhausted on floor.
Surge of footfalls outside.
Bodies mobilizing. A STAMPEDE.
A Yakuza enters to find her grinning.

TALL YAKUZA
What’s so funny?

ANI
She’s here. You’re all about to
die.

TALL YAKUZA
Yeah? I don’t think so. There’s a
100 of us.

ANI
Then you’re outnumbered, asshole.

He seethes, manhandles her out.

FOYER OUTSIDE CONFERENCE ROOM, 30TH FLOOR

Waves of Yakuza positioned in the concrete cavern.
Every weapon trained on the stairway/elevator.
Nervous. Quivering with anticipation. And anxiety.

EXPANSIVE CONFERENCE ROOM

Same inside.
Susumu and 10 of his best.
One holds onto Ani.
NEON PULSING through large windows.






 
118.


We stay here as the FIGHT starts outside.
Not a fight. A slaughter.
Men SHRIEKING. HOWLING. SCREECHING.
Painful, like being gutted by an animal.
A monster. Godzilla laying waste.
It keeps going. And going.
Everyone inside frozen with fear.
Except Ani: Ear-to-ear grin.

And suddenly there’s silence...
Somehow more unbearable then the violence.
Susumu nodding to the Lead.

SUSUMU
Go check.

Lead moving, punching lock code.
Cautiously clicking it open as,
BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!
Wet confetti blows through his chest.
Doors swing open. And just like that,

KATE’S INSIDE

Spurned by hell.
Body misshapen, caving on itself.
Creased to inhuman degree.
One leg useless. An arm too.
Face pulped. One eye fucked shut.
Gore coated, wouldn’t be called a person.
Someone’s dying dream. A nightmare.
A primal scream given form.

ANI
KATE!!!

The creature winks and says,

KATE
Hi babe, miss me?

Everyone opens up at once.
Ani SCREAMS.
Kate takes direct hits, falls.

SUSUMU
Stay down, bitch, just stay down!

She keeps coming.
This smudge of a person.
Bewitched by a lone purpose.
Standing only by it’s virtue.
Her body dead. Of poison, drugs, bullets.
The ghost still haunting these men.






 
119.


Not running, she’s falling in a straight line.

KATE
Got you, baby! Just be a second.

Guns spent, they rush her with blades.
Susumu backpedals, YANKING Ani along.
As Kate bites and claws. Literally.

Kamikaze yell, one SHANKS her rapidly.
She roars, CLAWS out his throat.
COUGHING BLOOD in another’s face.
He SLAPS her, she BITES out his jugular.
SPITS it at the last face, CRATERS it.
And keeps coming.
Forget atonement, this is EXORCISM.

Susumu jabs the gun into Ani’s head.

SUSUMU
Stop! Stop or I--

WHAM! Kate PUNCHES his chest.
Then collapses. For good.

Hit too weak, Susumu retains footing.
Smiles, moves the gun from Ani to Kate.

SUSUMU (CONT’D)
Before I kill you, know that I am
going to ruin this little bitch.

A hypothermic hiss,

KATE
I already killed you, 10 seconds
ago. You just didn’t know it.

Smug laugh, he pulls the trigger.
Tries to anyway.
When his body starts SEIZING.
He’s CHOKING, grabbing his chest.
BLOOD FOAMING his nose, mouth.
The hit did take. He drops.
And dies at Ani’s feet.

She rushes, puts Kate’s head in her lap.
Hysterical, tears erupting.

ANI
Kate! Kate, talk to me, Kate!

Kate’s breaths labored.
Paralyzed. Unable to move. Or talk.






 



ANI (CONT’D)
Kate, no, please, don’t go, please!

Last reserve of strength.
Kate SQUEEZING Ani’s hand in hers.
White-knuckled soul shake.
Vocal cords ruined, can’t speak.
Doesn’t need to.
Gives Ani a look.
Fierce. Exploding with moisture.
Mashing teeth, a GRUNT escaping.
No, not a grunt.

A ROAR.
This lioness.
Eyes fused to her cub’s.
Transmitting something.
Ani nodding back.
Understanding.

As Kate does something we didn’t think she could.
Gives her a smile.
And wouldn’t you know it.
It’s a goddamn beauty.
Blood and all.
Leaves Ani that gift.
As her grip slackens.
Ani realizing Kate passed her something.
In her hand, piece of paper we’ve seen before.
Account number, instructions.
And at the bottom, two heartbreaking words:
‘I care’

ANI (CONT’D)
No, no, no, no, no, Kate! Don’t go!

But Kate can’t hear anymore.
Her EYES FLUTTERING out.
Coasting to the WINDOW behind Ani.
NEON FLUCTUATING outside.
On a BILLBOARD we’ve glimpsed before.
The very FIRST IMAGE in fact.
HELLO-KITTY WAVING...

It’s what ALL OF THIS has been.
NOT FLASHBACKS, but--
HER LIFE FLASHING BEFORE HER/OUR EYES.

At the MOMENT OF HER DEATH.
Right now.
Catching back up to the FINAL IMAGE.
A neon kitty waving.

Left. Right. Left. Right. Lef-- BLACK.
 

120.

































































KATE DIES.
