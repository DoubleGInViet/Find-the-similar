EXT. THROMBEY ESTATE MANOR HOUSE - DAWN
The grounds of a New England manor.	Pre-dawn misty.
INT. MANOR - PANTRY / LIVING ROOM / FOYER / HALLWAY - DAWN
INSIDE THE MANOR
Unlit and still. Gothic with a theme of antique games, arcane puzzles and decorative weapons.
First floor: A drawing room, living room, kitchen. The detritus of a party. Stray champagne flutes.
INT. THROMBEY ESTATE - 2ND FLOOR - DAWN
Follow one housekeeper named FRAN carrying a tray of coffee up a flight of stairs.
Second floor: a hallway, doors all closed. The house has not woken up, and Fran steps lightly. Up a much narrower creaky flight of steep stairs.
INT. THROMBEY ESTATE - 3RD FLOOR MASTER BEDROOM - DAWN
Third floor: the master bedroom suite.
FRAN
Morning Mr Thrombey
But the bed is empty, unslept in. A robe thrown across it.
Fran heads out onto the landing and UP an EVEN NARROWER half flight of stairs, which leads to a single door.
FRAN (cont'd)
Mr Thrombey you up there? Mr Thrombey
I'm coming in
INT. HARLAN THROMBEY'S STUDY - DAWN
A cramped attic study, every shelf crammed with curios.
The door swings open and Fran sees:
HARLAN THROMBEY himself. 85 years old. Slung across a white leather day bed.
Throat slit.	Drenched in blood.	Very much dead.
2.
Fran's tray slips out of her hands for a second.
FRAN
Shit.
CUT TO:	Title card, on black.
THEN TO:
INT. MARTA'S BEDROOM - MORNING
MARTA CABRERA wakes with a cry.
Plain, modern, cramped. Marta, in her late twenties, takes a moment to catch her breath. Opens a window.
EXT. SOUTH BOSTON HOUSING PROJECT - MORNING
A tiny window in a cheap apartment building opens, Marta's face appears breathing deep.
SUPER:	"ONE WEEK - after Harlan Thrombey's demise"
INT. CABRERA KITCHEN - MORNING
Marta sits in front of a laptop. Her MOM is at the table with her, her sister ALICE watches CSI on an iPad on the counter top. Murder related dialog from the show.
Marta scroll through a jobs site, tired, eyes dead. Her mom watches, concerned.
MOM
Alice, turn that off now.
ALICE
Why it's almost over, what - they're finding out who did it and the wifi sucks in my room so it doesn't play it's like two minutes left what there isn't even anything bad on it, it's just normal tv and they're just talking ok ok goddddd whatever ok whatever.
MOM
Now please just turn it off.
Turn it off.	Now.
Alice.	Off.
They're talking about murder on it, your sister just had a friend she loves slit his throat open she doesn't need to be hearing that right now let's be sensitive!
3.
Mom standing yelling, Alice slams the iPad cover closed. Marta puts her head in her hand. Looks at her mom, who looks back at her with protective sympathy. Marta starts laughing at the absurdity of it, but the laugh turns into crying.
MARTA
Alice you can keep watching your show it's alright.
ALICE
No, I guessed who did it anyway. I'm sorry Marta.
Alice hugs her sister. Marta's phone rings. WALT THROMBEY.
MARTA
It's Harlan's son.
(answers)
Hi, Walt.
(listens)
Uh huh.
Her face shifts in confusion.
MARTA (cont'd)
What?
EXT. PRIVATE ROAD - LATE MORNING
A long narrow private road leading to the Thrombey estate.
Marta's shitty SUBCOMPACT car buzzes by, towards the house.
EXT. THROMBEY ESTATE FRONT DRIVE
Several cars, including a police cruiser with a few uniformed officers by it. Marta pulls up. An officer eyes her, approaches.
COP
Hey! Excuse me ma'am. Are you with the help?
MEG, Thrombey's college aged granddaughter, trots out.
MEG
Hey!	Her name is Marta, she was
granddad's nurse, she's with us.
"The help?".
4.
MARTA
(to the cop)
It's ok, sorry.
MEG
(mutters)
No. It's not ok.
hell?
What the
They hug, and are both instantly crying.	They laugh.
MARTA
Not very good. Alone, lots of just, this
(the crying)
and not knowing what to do next.
MEG
Anything you need, you're part of this family Marta.
MARTA
Thank you.
INT. FOYER
Thrombey's eldest daughter Linda opens the door for Marta.
LINDA
How you doing kiddo.
Linda is 60ish, well put together, sharp and steely eyed. She dresses and speaks with just a little more sharpness than any situation she's in requires.
MARTA
Hi Linda.	How are you?
LINDA
Ueuh. The funeral helped. I guess. Just seeing him. I thought you should have been there. I was out voted.
Linda's husband Richard walks in, on the phone. Same age as Linda, gruff and confident, will put his feet up on anything.
RICHARD (ON PHONE) I'm not the cop so I don't know. Alright fine, don't come, get arrested. Die up your own ass all I care.
(hangs up)
He's not coming.
(MORE)
5.
RICHARD (ON PHONE) (cont'd)
(to Marta)
Ransom. Little shit. Missed the funeral.
STATE TROOPER WAGNER, fresh faced in his 30s, pokes his head in through a door.
TROOPER WAGNER
Excuse me, we're ready for you now, we'd like to see you one at a time.
LINDA
Alright I'll go first. I'm assuming this will all be wrapped up before the memorial tonight.
TROOPER WAGNER
We'll do our best ma'am.
Linda exits with Wagner, leaving Richard and Marta.
RICHARD
So.	How you doing kiddo.
INT. LIBRARY
Mystery and horror memorabilia scattered on the shelves.
Linda sits opposite three men: LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT, in his 30s, in a working suit. Very good at his job. The young Trooper Wagner stands behind him.
Sitting back behind both of them, almost blending into the background, is a slight man in a linen suit. Legs and arms fold sharply, like a paper crane. Silent, listening.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT We are just going to reintroduce ourselves as a formality, I'm Detective Lieutenant Elliott, and this is Trooper Wagner. Now, I'm going to record, just makes it easier.
(squints at his phone) Alright, we're with Linda Drysdale, nee Thrombey, Harlan Thrombey's eldest daughter, in discussing the events the night of his demise, one week ago, November 8th.
TROOPER WAGNER
We're sorry for your loss.
6.
LINDA
(dry as chalk)
Thank you that means a lot.
Elliott checks his notes.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
So we understand that night the
family had gathered to celebrate your
father's eighty fifth birthday.
LINDA
Yes.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
How was that?
LINDA
The party? Pre my dad's death? It was great.
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT OF THE PARTY - FLASHBACK
Warmly lit, classic rock playing, food laid out. Linda and Richard mingle happily with the rest of the family (who we'll meet shortly.)
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT (V.O.)
Did anyone besides the family show face?
LINDA (V.O.)
Uh.	There was	Fran, the
housekeeper.	Marta, Harlan's
caregiver, good girl, hard worker.
Family's from Ecuador.	And Wanetta -
Greatnana, Harlan's mom.
At the snack table wearing a dozen coats, a woman who might be three hundred years old. She pounds down chips and dip like a machine.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT (V.O.)
(wow)
His mom?	How old is she?
LINDA (V.O.)
We have no idea.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT (V.O.) Okay, Your son Ransom, was he there as well?
7.
LINDA (V.O.)
Yes but he left early.
RANSOM DRYSDALE, roguishly handsome in his early 30s, breezes out the side door, past Greatnana.
GREATNANA
Ransom, are you leaving?
INT. LIBRARY
The strange man in the linen suit taps a piano key, as if reminding to ask him something.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT Right, did all three of you show up at around the same time?
LINDA
N... o, Richard came early to help the caterers set up.
She raises a questioning finger to ask about the man but
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Okay and you and your husband Richard work for a real estate firm in Boston?
LINDA
(sharp)
It's my company.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
(checks notes)
Sorry.	Right.
LINDA
I built my business from the ground up.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Just like your dad. You two were very close?
LINDA
We had our own secret way of communicating. You had to find that with dad. You had to find a game to play with him. And if you did that, and played by his rules... 
8.
CUT TO: Richard in the chair Linda was in, giving his statement.
RICHARD
Everyone idolizes their dad, right?
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
I don't know, do they?
RICHARD
Very much not, don't know why I said that. But Linda does.
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT OF THE PARTY
Harlan Thrombey, surrounded by his family, Richard and Linda flanking him, a birthday cake with candles. All smiles.
RICHARD (V.O.)
Harlan started with a rusty Smith-Corona, built himself into one of the bestselling mystery writers of all time.
INT. LIBRARY
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Seems like all his kids are self made
overachievers.
Richard makes a "... sure" face.
RICHARD
Sure.
CUT TO:
WALT THROMBEY now sits in the questioning chair. Late 40s, softly obsequious in a sweater and loafers. His leg is in a cast.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
For the record, I'm speaking to Walt Thrombey, Harlan Thrombey's youngest son.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT (cont'd) So you run your father's publishing company?
9.
WALT
Yeah. It's my - it's our, it's the family's publishing company, dad trusts me to run it. 30 languages, over 80 million copies sold. A real legacy. You guys fans?
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT I don't do much fiction -
BIG fan.
TROOPER WAGNER
Big.
TROOPER WAGNER (cont'd) His plots, like something like "A Thousand Knives," with the - I don't want to spoil it but - the cow and the shotgun, like where do you come up with that?
WALT
Dad said the plots just popped into his head fully formed, that was the easy part for him -
TAP from the linen suit man's finger.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT You live in town, right? You guys probably arrived at around the same time?
Walt looks at Linen suit, thrown.
WALT
Uh.	We all got here around 8.
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT OF THE PARTY
Walt laughing and mingling with his nervous wife DONNA.
WALT (V.O.)
My wife Donna, she's my rock.
Richard backs up into Donna, who YELPS in fear and throws her martini in the air. Richard jumps, but Walt doesn't even register it.
RICHARD
Jeeesus!	Donna, you alright?
WALT (V.O.)
And my son Jacob, he's sixteen. Very politically active.
10.
His angry looking son JACOB, who is always on his phone.
INT. LIBRARY
Quick cuts, each in the chair:
RICHARD
The boy's literally a Nazi
MEG
He's an alt-right troll dipshit
WALT
Kids today, with the internet,
amazing.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
So the night went well?
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT OF THE PARTY
The exact same moment we saw with Richard and Linda of Harlan in front of the birthday cake - but now it's Walt, Donna and Jacob next to Harlan.
WALT (V.O.)
I mean. We're all gutted but I'm happy we got that night with him. To be by his side, to think about our books and what we've accomplished with them, it's like I can still feel his hand on my shoulder.
INT. LIBRARY
WALT
Passing the torch.
Cut to: JONI THROMBEY in the chair. A striking woman, tall and boho chic in chunky jewelry and a flowy dress.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
So we are with Joni Thrombey, Harlan
Thrombey's...  daughter in law?
JONI
Mm.	I was married to his son Neil,
We had one daughter, Meg, and then
Neil passed on fifteen years ago.
11.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
And you remained close to the
Thrombeys.
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT OF THE PARTY
Joni dances with various family members, free and flowing.
JONI (V.O.)
Oh they're my family. I feel simultaneously freed by and supported by them, that balance of opposites is the nugget of Flam.
INT. LIBRARY - PRESENT
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Sorry, the Nugget of?
JONI
Flam.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Ah! Yeah Flam, right, your skin care company. Sorry.
JONI
I forgive you, yes, it's skin care but it promotes a total lifestyle. Self sufficiency with an acknowledgment of human need. That's Flam, but it's also Harlan. He got me and Meg through some tough times.
Meg in the chair.
MEG
Granddad gives my mom a yearly allowance, and he's never missed wiring a tuition payment to my schools. He's a genuinely selfless man.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
You left his party early?
MEG
To see some friends at Smith.
12.
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT OF THE PARTY
Meg trots out.	Linda, pissed, to Richard so Joni can hear:
LINDA
you know, Dad's paying for her crypto-Marxist postdeconstructual feminist poetry theory whatever major, she could have stuck around for the cake.
INT. LIBRARY
JONI
I think Linda was upset. But Harlan understood.
Tap.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT Right. You two arrived together to the party at the same time?
Joni looks at the linen suit man.
JONI
If I could - pause - because I, who is that guy? And why are we doing all this? Again?
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Just some follow up questions, just
being thorough, in order to determine
the manner of death.
Cut back to Walt in the chair.
WALT
(almost laughing)
So by "manner of death" you mean if he was killed. If one of us killed him. One of his family?
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT None of us think that, this is pro forma, all of it.
CUT TO:	Richard in the chair.	He doesn't buy it.
RICHARD
Ok.	So who the fuck is that?
13.
He points at linen suit.	Elliott takes a breath.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
This is Benoit Blanc.
RICHARD
(the hell?)
Benoit Blanc?
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Yes. Mr. Blanc is a private
investigator of great renown.
Joni in the chair.
JONI
Wait a minute - I read a tweet about a New Yorker article about you. The last of the gentlemen sleuths? You solved that case with the tennis champ - you're famous!
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Mr. Blanc is not with the police department, he is not officially involved with the case but he has offered to consult. I happily obliged and I can vouch for him.
Linda in the chair.
LINDA
Mr. Blanc, I know who you are, I read your New Yorker profile. It was delightful. I just buried my eighty five year old father who committed suicide. Why are you here?
Elliott and Wagner turn back to Blanc, who leans forward slightly and speaks in the gentlest southern lilt you have ever heard in your life.
BLANC
I am here at the behest of a client.
LINDA
Who?
BLANC
I cannot say, but let me assure you this: my presence will be ornamental.
(MORE)
14.
BLANC (cont'd)
You will find me a respectful, quiet, passive observer. Of the truth.
Elliott and Wagner turn nervously back to Linda. She doesn't look thrilled. Cut to Richard.
RICHARD
Fine.	Are we getting there?
BLANC
Nearly. Harlan's nurse. She was at the party in a professional capacity?
Blanc begins idly playing with a silver dollar.
RICHARD
Marta?
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT OF THE PARTY
The family is engaged in an animated discussion, Marta standing on the outskirts.
RICHARD (V.O.)
I guess. Harlan hired her to be around, take care of whatever medical needs pop up, but really she's like part of the family.
Richard beckons with his cake, calls Marta into the discussion, into the circle of the family.
RICHARD (V.O.) (cont'd) Good kid, been a good friend to Harlan. Her family's from Paraguay. Linda really likes her work ethic.
INT. LIBRARY
RICHARD
"Immigrants - we get the job done."
From Hamilton.
Wagner gives him a smile to show he got the reference.
TROOPER WAGNER
Oh Hamilton!
RICHARD
I saw it at the public.
15.
Cut to Linda back in the chair.
BLANC
May I just - and then I'll recede, but as a self made man myself I have to express my admiration for how you've followed in your father's footsteps.
LINDA
Thank you.
BLANC
Just marvelous. The whole family too. Joni with her things, Walt with his publishing empire.
LINDA
Well.
Blanc pauses.	Doesn't push anything.	Just waits a moment.
LINDA (cont'd)
Yes. I mean. Walt, yeah. He's done well with what dad's given him.
Walt - not like it matters but he was sort of adrift, dad gave him the job, but really dad hands him a book twice a year and Walt publishes it, I mean...  it's just not the same.
BLANC
But surely Walt runs the merchandising, adaptations, film and television rights... 
Linda squints, narrowing her eyes on Blanc.	Softly:
LINDA
Are you baiting me, Detective? You know he doesn't, and you think I'm dumb enough to be baited into talking family business, into shit talking my brother in front of a police detective and a state trooper -
Richard in the chair.
RICHARD
Walt doesn't run shit! There are no film or TV rights, Harlan's never allowed any adaptations of his books. Hates the idea.
16.
BLANC
No!
RICHARD
Oh yeah! Drives Walt nuts, cause that's where the real money's at. When he gets a little Irish courage in him he'll get into it with Harlan.
BLANC
Did he get "into it" at the party?
RICHARD
Oh my god.
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT OF THE PARTY
Walt with a drink in his hand has cornered Harlan. Richard watches across the room as Walt goes from arguing to pleading.
RICHARD (V.O.)
He wouldn't leave him alone, poor guy. Harlan had to give him the hook.
Harlan has had enough, he takes Walt's arm and leads him into the drawing room for a private talk.
RICHARD (V.O.) (cont'd) I didn't hear what he said but he must have really handed him his lunch, Walt was like a wounded puppy the rest of the night.
INT. LIBRARY
Walt in the chair, indignant.
WALT
What? Richard said what? Jesus. No, we didn't get "into it."
BLANC
I'm just trying to get an accurate impression - Harlan took you aside at the party, when you returned you were chastened, what did Harlan say to you?
Walt starts to open his mouth, hesitates. Off his frightened face we FLASH BACK:
17.
INT. DRAWING ROOM - NIGHT OF THE PARTY
Walt, drunk, Harlan guiding him firmly into the shadows.
WALT	HARLAN
The Netflix guys, their
business affairs guy sent
over something, hard numbers
this time, and I think -	Walt.
this is a window, it's not
going to last and you should
just look at these numbers	Walt.
WALT
Dad you put me in charge of our books let me be in charge, let me do this! Please.
HARLAN
They're not our books, son. They're my books. And this is not how I wanted to have this conversation but, you're right, it's unfair of me to keep you tethered to something that isn't yours to control.
WALT
What?
HARLAN
I've done you a grave disservice all these years, I've kept you from building something of your own, that's yours. You're not going to run the publishing house anymore. You are free of it.
WALT
Dad.	Are you firing me?
HARLAN
We'll talk about details tomorrow.
But my mind's made up. Good boy.
Harlan pats his face, then leaves him shell shocked.
INT. LIBRARY
Back to Walt's hesitating face. The briefest of moments has passed. Walt lies:
18.
WALT
We talked, we had a business discussion, about e-books, Jesus, it was nothing. You want to talk about an argument, hell Ransom had an argument with him.
BLANC
Ransom, Richard and Linda's son?
WALT
Look we love Ransom, he is a good kid, we love him.
BLANC
... but
WALT
But he's always been the black sheep of the family, and I'm not, I, I keep stuff like this in the family, but with Ransom, he's never had a job. But dad for some unknown reason has always supported him, they've got this love hate bond. They fight. But that night, god. They had a blow out.
BLANC
About what?
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT OF THE PARTY
The family having a conversation, everyone but Harlan, Jacob and Ransom. It grinds to a halt as through the door to Harlan's study indistinct shouting booms.
WALT (V.O.)
We couldn't make it out, but it was huge. And it was strange they went in another room to do it - they usually love stoking up drama in front of the whole family.
Ransom bursts out of the doors and storms out of the party, past Greatnana.
GREATNANA
Ransom are you leaving?
19.
INT. LIBRARY
Richard in the chair.
BLANC
Speaking of getting into it, you were at the house early to help the caterer set up. Did you converse with Harlan at that time?
RICHARD
He was there, we must have spoke.
BLANC
In his study?
RICHARD
I don't think so.
BLANC
You see, I spoke with the caterer this morning. She didn't see you helping her staff, but she did hear Harlan in a screaming match with someone that afternoon. In his study.
RICHARD
I don't, a screaming match? No. Joni was here too, she was early, maybe it was her, ask her.
BLANC
These were two male voices.
INT. HALLWAY - DAY OF PARTY
A CATERER walks through with a platter. Pauses, hears shouting through the wall.
BLANC (V.O.)
Harlan shouted the phrase
HARLAN (O.S.)
... you tell her or I will!
INT. LIBRARY
BLANC
You tell her.	Or I will.	Bells
ringing?
20.
For a just a split second, Richard considers what he is going to say. In the second, we FLASH BACK:
INT. SMALL STUDY - DAY OF PARTY
Harlan showing Richard photos on a laptop. Long lens photos, of Richard kissing a woman who is not Linda. Richard glares at it, Harlan turns an old baseball over in his hands.
RICHARD
That's none of your business, Harlan.
Stay out of my marriage.
Harlan holds up a sealed small envelope with flowery embroidery, "L" written on the front.
HARLAN
I know my daughter. She'd want to know. I've put it all in this letter to her, tomorrow she gets it.
RICHARD
I'm warning you once, don't do this like hell -
HARLAN
She deserves to know, you're going to tell her!
Harlan slams the baseball down on the desk.
HARLAN (cont'd)
You tell her or I will!
INT. LIBRARY
Back to Richard.	He grins, snaps his fingers.
RICHARD
Yes. I know - yes, ha. So. Harlan decided to finally put his mom in a nursing home. Which Linda always opposed. And I was going to wait till we were back home in Boston to tell her, so there wouldn't be a whole scene, but Harlan wanted me to tell her then. That was it. Sorry. Forgot.
Joni in the chair.
JONI
The house?
21.
BLANC
Early.	Richard said you were there.
JONI
I was.	At the house early.
BLANC
To see Harlan?
JONI
To see Harlan.	Yes.
Joni stops, smelling something in the air. She's about to ask about it but -
BLANC
What were you seeing Harlan about?
JONI
It was just a mix up with the payment for Meg's tuition.
BLANC
I'm sorry to press, what kind of mix up?
Joni hesitates, we FLASH BACK:
INT. SMALL STUDY - DAY OF PARTY
Harlan at his desk, toying with the same old baseball. This is a thing he does at his desk. Joni standing, arms crossed.
JONI
The school hasn't got the check yet,
I don't know why Alan didn't mail it
HARLAN
Alan didn't mail it because he caught a discrepancy. Alan's office has been wiring tuition directly to the school, as per your request. But Phyllis's office that handles your yearly allowance has been wiring the tuition money directly to you as well. As per your request. You've been double dipping Meg's tuition, stealing from me. A hundred thousand dollars a year. For the past four years.
22.
Harlan shows Joni a letter from his business manager, with transaction receipts attached.
JONI
Harlan. I don't know how this mix up happened but
Harlan opens his ledger, hand writes a check.
HARLAN
I'm writing this tuition check, then that is the last money you or Meg will get from me.
JONI
Please you don't understand
HARLAN
I know it'll hurt but it's for the best.
Joni's speechless, her face frozen. Harlan puts the baseball down and detaches the check, holds it out to her.
HARLAN (cont'd)
My mind's made up.
INT. LIBRARY
Back to Joni.	She shakes her head.
JONI
Just a money wiring issue. With the office at the school. So I had to ask Harlan to cut a check for this semester. No big deal.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Why don't we take a breather.
INT. FOYER - DAY
Joni comes out into the foyer from the library, obviously rattled. She pulls it together quick when Linda comes down the stairs.
LINDA
Joni. You haven't seen Richard have you?
23.
JONI
No, I was just in with the - no.
INT. SMALL STUDY
LINDA (O.S.)
Richard!
Alone, Richard waits very still for Linda's footsteps to walk away, then when he knows she's not coming in he furtively rifles through desk drawers, finding various ridiculous ephemera. He finds a small locked drawer, jimmies it open with a letter opener.
Inside - the small pink envelope Harlan threatened him with in his flashback. He rips it open, pulls out the card inside.
It is blank.
Richard almost laughs.	Drops it onto the desk.
RICHARD
Son of a bitch.
He spots Harlan's old baseball. Grabs it, spitefully chucks it out the open window.
EXT. SIDE OF HOUSE - DAY
Blanc, Elliott and Wagner stroll long the wide lawn beside the house. Blanc ignites a long thin cigar.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT Maybe I'm a victim of my own expectations. But when the great Benoit Blanc knocks on my door, I expect it's going to be for something...  if not extraordinary, at least interesting. This is an open and shut case of suicide.
(checks watch)
And Benny we're at the point where I need to know what we're doing here.
Blanc notices the OLD BASEBALL lying in the grass. He picks it up idly.
24.
BLANC
The method, throat slit. Typical of a suicide?
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT Dramatic. But look around. The guy practically lives in a CLUE board.
INT. FOYER
Marta sits alone, across from a portrait of Harlan. Muffled voices out on the patio. Cigar smoke drifts by outside.
She creeps over to the glass door.	Puts her ear to it.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT (O.S.) You ask me to drag all these good people back for questioning, go over it all again, I don't get it. This is a pleasant family with the usual quarrels but no possible motives for murder - where are you going?
At that moment, BLANC's face appears right next to Marta's staring right at her through the distorted glass. She yelps and falls back.
EXT. PATIO
Blanc opens the glass door. Marta steps back sheepishly, but with a warm nod Blanc beckons for her to join them.
BLANC
Harlan Thrombey's nurse, Marta... 
MARTA
... Cabrera
BLANC
Marta Cabrera.
TROOPER WAGNER
Miss Cabrera, you can just wait
inside - we'll be with you soon.
BLANC
Miss Cabrera, I been doing a little poking, you're hired on a part time basis as a registered nurse, yes?
25.
MARTA
Yeah, I don't work for a VNA. Harlan hired me directly.
BLANC
You're paid a flat rate for how many hours a week?
MARTA
I started at 15, but slowly he... 
needed more help.
BLANC
Medical help?
MARTA
He needed a friend.
Blanc smiles at the girl, genuinely touched.
BLANC
Does having a kind heart make you a good nurse?
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Blanc.
BLANC
Yes. Marta we were just discussing possible motives in the family. I suspect Harlan has told you much unfiltered truth about each of them, and a little bird has told me, how shall I put this delicately? You have a regurgitive reaction to mistruthin'.
MARTA
Who told you that?
BLANC
Is it true?
MARTA
Yes. It's something that I have had as a kid. It's a physically thing that I - I - Just the thought of lying, yeah, it makes me puke.
BLANC
Really? Is Richard having an affair?
Marta is stunned.	She FLASHES BACK TO:
26.
EXT. PATIO - DAY - FLASHBACK
She reads, Harlan sits at his laptop, heavy with sadness.
HARLAN
Why do men instinctively pull at loose threads on their parachutes?
MARTA
What?
Harlan spins his laptop towards her - the Richard photos.
EXT. PATIO - DAY
Back to our scene.	Marta looks queasy, tries to stall.
MARTA
Heh - Richard? - affair?	Heh.
BLANC
A yes or no will do.
She struggles, her jaw clenched, face working hard, then attempts -
MARTA
... ..no
And immediately VOMITS into a nearby planter.
Whoa!
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
TROOPER WAGNER Oh my god!
They all rush to her, Blanc brings water, awfully concerned.
BLANC
Dear girl I'm sorry. I assumed you were speaking figuratively.
Blanc takes the shortest acceptable beat of concern before turning to Elliott.
BLANC (cont'd)
Quite something. But I was obviously right, Richard is having an affair, his father in law found out and confronted him. "You tell her. Or I will."
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Even if it's true...  you ok?
27.
Marta gives a weak thumbs up, recovering
ELLIOTT
Even if that was right, protecting his marriage is weak sauce as a motive.
BLANC
Well.	And then there is...  Joni.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT	TROOPER WAGNER
Joni?	Joni?!
TROOPER WAGNER (cont'd) Lifestyle guru Joni? No. Harlan was supporting her and her daughter, she had the opposite of a motive.
Marta tries to quietly slip back into the house
BLANC
And if that support was threatened?
Miss Cabrera one moment please
MARTA
I'm just going to go get some Scope
BLANC
Miss Cabrera, was Harlan planning on cutting off Joni's allowance?
Off Marta's "oh god no" face:
INT. STUDY - DAY - FLASHBACK
Harlan looking at the letter from his business manager, with the transaction receipts. He sighs heavily.
HARLAN
Oh, Joni.
MARTA
What's up?
He hands her the letter.
EXT. PATIO - DAY
Marta's face works against impending nausea.
28.
MARTA
I... 
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Ok don't answer that if you're going to puke. Please.
But Blanc presses.
BLANC
Meg said Harlan pays the school directly, Joni says he sends the money to her. Both were true, she was pocketing the double payment, Harlan found out and cut her off without a cent. Yes?
Marta starts to shake her head no, but her throat convulses.
She nods.	Blanc hands her a glass of water.
TROOPER WAGNER
And she bumps him off for the
inheritance?	Come. On!	Have you
seen her insta?	She's an influencer.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
An allowance as a motive, Blanc. She has her business. More weak sauce.
Blanc idly scratches a spot on the side of his neck.
BLANC
Granted. But she lied. To me. All three of them did.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Three?
BLANC
Walter.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
I see where you are going with this.
BLANC
But there was something else. Harlan had turned Walter down before regarding film rights, but that night something Harlan said shook him. We look at the pattern, Harlan was cleaning house. I wonder... 
(to Marta)
did he plan to fire Walter?
29.
MARTA
(honest & relieved)
Can I wait inside? I don't feel like I should be here.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Yes, please just wait inside but stay close.
She steps back in, grateful.	Blanc to Elliott:
BLANC
You've been very patient my friend, and you are right, none of these weak alibis and domestic squibbles answer your question: why is Benoit Blanc here? But now I will tell you why.
(beat)
I am here because this morning someone dodged one very important question.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Who?
BLANC
Me.	Linda asked who hired me.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
So who hired you?
BLANC
I. Do. Not. Know. An envelope of cash showed up at my apartment yesterday, with the news clipping of Thrombey's death.
TROOPER WAGNER
An envelope?	That worked?
BLANC
An envelope of cash.
Blanc indicates with his fingers - several inches thick.
BLANC (cont'd)
So somebody suspects foul play, but goes through this ha cha dance of hiring me, of staying anonymous. It makes no damn sense. Compels me though.
(MORE)
30.
BLANC (cont'd)
(beat)
Walk me through everyone's whereabouts at the time of death.
Elliott hesitates, but Blanc's got him hooked. He flips open his notebook. Blanc leans back, closes his eyes.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
We know, the party broke up at 11:30.
INT. SECOND FLOOR LANDING - NIGHT OF PARTY
Marta and Harlan vanish up the stairs towards the third floor, while Richard and Linda head into the bedroom right next to the stairs. Down the hallway Joni waves, and ducks into another bedroom.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT (V.O.) Marta took Harlan upstairs to give him his meds, Richard and Linda and Joni went right to bed. Now we do have this: the stairs leading up to Harlan's bedroom and his attic office creak horribly.
INT. RICHARD AND LINDA'S GUEST ROOM - NIGHT OF THE PARTY
Richard sleeps deep, Linda sleeps lightly.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT (V.O.) And Linda is a light sleeper. So we know every time someone took the stairs that night.
INT. JONI AND MEG'S GUEST ROOM - NIGHT OF PARTY
Joni has decorated the room with colorful silks and candles.
She is in lotus position on her bed, meditating.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT (V.O.) The first was when Joni heard a ka-THUNK from somewhere above her in the house.
Ka-THUNK!	Joni looks up at the ceiling.
INT. SECOND FLOOR LANDING - NIGHT OF PARTY
Joni trots down the hall and up the creaky stairs.
31.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT (V.O.)
She's concerned about Harlan, she went up to investigate. Waking Linda.
INT. RICHARD AND LINDA'S GUEST ROOM - NIGHT OF PARTY
CREAK CREAK CREAK! From outside.	Linda's eyes pop open.
INT. THIRD FLOOR LANDING - NIGHT OF PARTY
Joni knocks on the door of Harlan's attic office. It opens, and Harlan answers. In the room behind him we see Marta, her back turned, preparing a hypo needle.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT (V.O.) Harlan was in his attic office with Marta. He explained that they had just knocked the GO board over - that game with the grid and stones, they play it every night, and he was fine, go to bed. So she does.
The spilled GO board on the floor. Joni kisses Harlan on the cheek, goes. He shuts the door.
INT. RICHARD AND LINDA'S GUEST ROOM - NIGHT OF PARTY
Linda has just gotten back to sleep.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT (V.O.) Ten minutes later, Linda is woken a second time, by Marta leaving.
CREAK CREAK CREAK!	Linda wakes, supremely annoyed.
MARTA (O.S.)
Walt!	I'm leaving!
EXT. FRONT PORCH - NIGHT OF PARTY
Walt and Jacob sit on the porch, Walt with a cigar, Jacob with his phone. Marta trots through, saying goodbye.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT (V.O.) Walt was smoking a cigar on the porch with his son. He saw her leave and drive off, and noted the time - midnight.
32.
Walt glances at his watch.	Midnight.
INT. RICHARD AND LINDA'S GUEST ROOM - NIGHT OF PARTY
Linda with a pillow over her head.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT (V.O.) Fifteen minutes later, Linda is woken for the third and final time. By someone coming down the stairs.
CREAK CREAK CREAK! Linda wakes. You've gotta be kidding me.
EXT. FRONT PORCH - NIGHT OF PARTY
Walt, still smoking with Jacob, spots Harlan through the glazed glass, coming down the stairs in the foyer.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT (V.O.) Harlan. Who came down for midnight snacks, which Walt tried to discourage.
WALT
Dad, go to bed!
Through the glazed glass, Harlan goes back up the stairs.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT (V.O.) Based on this, the medical examiner determined time of death to be between 12:15 and 2am. As Walt was finishing his cigar, about 12:30, Meg came home. She went straight to bed. Walt and Jacob turned in shortly after that.
Meg pulls up, trots past Walt and Jacob and inside.
