INT. JONI AND MEG'S GUEST ROOM - NIGHT OF PARTY
Meg stirs, wakes.	Joni is asleep.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT (V.O.) Sometime later that night, undetermined but possibly near 3am, Meg woke up because the dogs were barking outside. She used the bathroom and went back to bed.
33.
EXT. PATIO - DAY
Elliott snaps the notebook closed.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
And that's it. Everyone's stories matched, every movement accounted for.
BLANC
There is no other staircase up to
Harlan's room?
Blanc scratches that same spot on the side of his neck.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
No.	Just the creaky one.
Blanc seems intrigued by this.
BLANC
Interesting.
TROOPER WAGNER
So I guess we can rule out Ransom, he wasn't there. And Marta, Harlan was alive after she left. But Meg got home during the time of death window.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Except it was a suicide.	Harlan hit
both carotids, we saw from the blood
blood splat patterns that they were
uninterrupted.	Meaning, It's almost
impossible for anyone to have been
around him at the time. He's the one
that cut his own throat. I don't know
why we keep going over this.
BLANC
Physical evidence can tell a clear story with a forked tongue.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
What?
BLANC
And as we've seen this morning,
everyone can lie.	Well.	Almost
everyone.
34.
INT. LIBRARY - LATE AFTERNOON
Marta in the chair.	She shifts, uncomfortable.
Blanc, Elliott and Wagner in their normal places.
BLANC
Ms. Cabrera, we've kept you waiting all afternoon because I wanted to hear from you last. I wanted to have the entire picture of the evening in my head. Your piece of it is at its very center. So please, take your time. You took Mr. Thrombey upstairs at 11:30. And left at midnight. Think very carefully. And with as much detail as possible, tell us what happened in that half hour.
Marta is very still. A moment of silence. Blanc flips his silver dollar into the air.
She does not say a word, but in that moment while the coin hangs in the air we FLASH BACK with her to:
INT. HARLAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
The night of the party. A clock on a nightstand: 11:32. Off screen we hear Marta leading Harlan up the creaky stairs.
MARTA
Up up up up - you got it?
I got it.
it.
HARLAN
Up up up I got
Marta enters the room, and behind her we see Harlan keep climbing up the narrow stairs to his office.
MARTA
Up up nooooo no not tonight, no straight to bed tonight it is soooo late c'mon. Harlan. Harlan!
She grabs a med kit from the bedroom and follows him, exasperated.
INT. HARLAN THROMBEY'S STUDY - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
Harlan sits, setting up a GO board.	Marta enters.
MARTA
It's late, I had champagne no no no
35.
HARLAN
It's my birthday, we are - You had one glass - we're not breaking tradition on my birthday.
Marta puts two vials and a pill box on the GO board. She pulls out two plastic wrapped hypodermics.
MARTA
Take your goddamn medicine and go to bed.
HARLAN
If you're going to put that vile shit in me you will have to earn it. On my birthday.
(playing it up)
Eighty fifth.	So old.	Soo olddd
MARTA
Alright old man.	8x8 game. You
ready?
She sits and they start clacking white and black stones on the board.
HARLAN
Why can't I beat you at this game?
Oh uh huh.
MARTA
Because I'm not playing to beat you, I'm playing to build a beautiful pattern.
They play fast, and Marta is obviously winning.
HARLAN
Elder abuse.	I'm calling the AARP.
MARTA
Don't make me get the belt.
HARLAN
It's basically over. My only hope is that an earthquake will strike. But what are the chances -
Harlan starts shaking the table with his knee. He looks around, startled. Marta just stares at him, deadpan.
HARLAN (cont'd)
Get under a door frame!
36.
He tips the whole table and the GO board and med vials and syringe and med kit fall to the soft rug. Things spill out of the kit. A mess. Marta just shakes her head.
MARTA
Meds then beds.
HARLAN
Fair.
She retrieves the vials and loads a syringe from one of them. Harlan rolls up his sleeve revealing a pre-inserted catheter. He crosses to close the room's only small window.
HARLAN (cont'd)
Ugh, Walt's smoking a cigar on the porch. Nasty things.
MARTA
How was tonight?
She hooks the syringe up to the catheter and slowly injects him bit by bit while he talks.
HARLAN
Tonight was...  good.
MARTA
Because I know you weren't looking forward to it.
HARLAN
No. But I did it. Cut the line on all four of them. It was not easy. This goddamn fortune. Sometimes I think, everything I've given my family, I've done, maybe without knowing it, maybe, to keep them beneath me. I should have what... 
maybe, I don't know. Encouraged Walt to write his own stories, not just be a caretaker of mine. Like you said I should. Been a father, not just a provider, to Joni. Like you've also said. I should have been kinder to Linda. And Ransom.
Harlan takes a curved ornamental dagger from a display mount, turns it over in his hands.
HARLAN (cont'd)
Jesus there's so much me in that kid.
Confident, stupid, I dunno.
(MORE)
37.
HARLAN (cont'd)
Protected.	Playing life like a game
without consequence, till you can't
tell the difference between a stage
prop and a real knife.
He stabs it into the desk, sharp and real.	Leaves it there.
HARLAN (cont'd)
I don't fear death. But god I'd like to fix some of this before I go. Close the book with a flourish. I guess we'll see.
MARTA
I guess we will.	Hey.	Old man.
You've had a long day. Wanna do
drugs.
She loads the second syringe from the second vial.
HARLAN
you mean the good stuff?
MARTA
Yeah but just a tiny bit.
HARLAN
Send me to lala land. Why did I wait till my mid eighties to become a morphine user, what a schmuck, what a nud-nig, this stuff's the best.
She pulls the needle from the second vial...  then sees the label. Freezes. Blinks at it.
MARTA
Oh my god.
She snatches up the first vial she just injected him from. Compares the label to the one she just picked up. They're similar but not the same.
HARLAN
Is there a problem?
MARTA
This is what I just gave you 100
milligrams of.	But I messed up.
HARLAN
You gave me 100 milligrams of the good stuff.
38.
She immediately pulls an EMERGENCY KIT from a nearby shelf, starts calmly but quickly going through its contents.
HARLAN (cont'd)
What's the good stuff dosage supposed to be?
MARTA
Lets not call it that right now - three milligrams.
HARLAN
That's much less.	So what happens?
MARTA
I give you an emergency shot of Naloxone, so that you don't die in ten minutes.
HARLAN
Well no pressure. You know that's an interesting, efficient method for murder, I need to write that down.
He gets a little notebook and scribbles while she checks and rechecks the kit contents with increasing urgency.
HARLAN (cont'd)
So if someone switched the meds on purpose I'd be dead in ten minutes, like stone cold dead?
MARTA
You'll feel symptoms in five. Sweats, disorientation. Then yeah, that big a dose, injected, within ten your respiratory - your - yes ten minutes.
HARLAN
From the time of injection, so eightish now. And even if the victim called an ambulance when he first felt symptoms, if he was at a country home like this one...  where the ambulance takes fifteen minutes to arrive, it would be too late. If the victim didn't have this emergency Naxostuff.
He watches her. She's now digging around the carpet, looking under the couch. She dumps the entire contents of the kit out and is now frantically going through it. A bead of sweat rolls down Harlan's brow.
39.
HARLAN (cont'd)
Marta.	Do you have Naxostuff?
MARTA
Yes! Naloxone yes it comes with the emergency kit - it should be here, it's - fuck. No Harlan it's not here. It's not. Oh my god.
They look at each other for a second. She's panicked. He's thinking.
MARTA (cont'd)
Where's my phone?	Shit -
She picks up a landline phone on the table, dials 911 with shaking hands -
Before it can even ring, the line goes dead.
She looks, unbelieving:	Harlan's finger is on the cradle.
His eyes are locked with hers, serious and certain.
MARTA (cont'd)
Harlan what are you doing?
HARLAN
Marta, listen to me.
MARTA
Harlan we need to - are you crazy, we need to call, they need to get here I need to -
HARLAN
Stop. Stop stop, Marta listen there isn't time stop now stop
She goes for her cell phone across the room and Harlan stops her - they trip and fall to the ground with a KA-THUNK.
MARTA
What are you doing are you nuts?
HARLAN
Marta it's too late it is over, it's too late I am dead listen. LISTEN.
He actually puts his hand over her mouth.
HARLAN (cont'd)
Listen.	If what you said is true I
am gone, there's no saving me, we
have six minutes.	There is one last
thing I need to do in this world, and
only you can help me do it.	But you
need to trust me and do everything I
say.
40.
MARTA
What do you want to do?
HARLAN
Get you out of this. Think of your mom - please trust me, we have to make this look ironclad like it can't have been your fault. You. Can't. Have done this.
MARTA
My mom... ?
CREAK on the stairs outside.
HARLAN
Get up.
A knock on the door.
JONI (O.S.)
Harlan?	Marta?	Everything alright?
Harlan and Marta stand. She's dazed, deer in the headlights, but he's focused and sharp. He turns her away from the door.
HARLAN
Stand here, keep your back to me, don't say a word.
Harlan opens the door. While he gets rid of Joni we stick with Marta, who stands stock still, tears running down her face, eyes wild - what does she do?
HARLAN (cont'd)
Joni.
JONI
I - hi - I heard something, is
everything ok?
HARLAN
Oh yes we just, I just knocked over the GO board, sorry about that.
JONI
Everything's alright?
HARLAN
Yes yes all fine, go to bed Joni.
41.
JONI
Ok. And maybe we can talk tomorrow about the, uh, the thing with
HARLAN
Yes.	Tomorrow.
JONI
Love you,	Night.
HARLAN
Night night.
Harlan shuts the door. Looks at the knife still sticking in the desk. Then takes Marta's shoulders, looks in her eyes.
HARLAN (cont'd)
Pay attention now, your mom is still undocumented, if this is your fault she'll be found out and at best deported, your family will be broken.
A new kind of fear in Marta's eyes.
Oh god
MARTA
HARLAN
But we're not going to let
that happen. I have a plan,
it's not going to be easy
but you have to do exactly
what I tell you.	Will you
do this Marta?	This last
thing.	For me, and for your
family.
She's terrified.
But she nods.
MARTA
What do you want me to do?
EXT. FRONT PORCH - NIGHT OF THE PARTY - FLASHBACK
Walt smoking and Jacob.
HARLAN (V.O.)
Go downstairs as noisily as you can, say goodbye loudly.
MARTA (O.S.)
Walt!	I'm leaving!
Marta exits quickly, down to her car.
42.
HARLAN (V.O.)
Call attention to the time if you can.
MARTA
God it's midnight already.
Walt checks his watch.
INT. MARTA'S CAR - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
She drives out the guard gate and down the private road.
HARLAN (V.O.)
Drive out the gate, then to avoid the security cameras, pull off the road BEFORE the carved elephant.
Up ahead - a weathered wood carved elephant statue.
MARTA
Wait...  was it before or after?
HARLAN (V.O.)
AFTER the carved elephant.
MARTA
No, he said - before?	Was it?
HARLAN (V.O.)
BEAFTERFORE the carved elephant.
MARTA
Shit... 
She yanks the wheel and pulls off BEFORE the statue.
EXT. WOODS - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
Marta trudges away from the parked car, tree branches catching her hair.
HARLAN (V.O.)
Park and come back on foot up to the house,
43.
EXT. THROMBEY ESTATE SIDE GATE - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
A waist-high stone wall with a little pedestrian gate. The house up ahead. Marta goes through the gate and up towards the house.
HARLAN (V.O.)
Take the side yard path, through that little gate.
The DOGS sprint down the moonlit yard from the house towards Marta.
HARLAN (V.O.) (cont'd)
The dogs will know you, they
shouldn't bark.
The dogs stop at Marta and lick her hand.
EXT. THROMBEY ESTATE SIDE YARD - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
Marta looks up the side of the looming house. A sturdy trellis on the wall, and high above a third story window.
HARLAN (V.O.)
You've got to get up to the third floor without being seen, and the only way is to climb the side trellis and come in through the trick hall window.
MARTA
You've gotta be kidding me.
HARLAN (V.O.)
I am not.	Do it.
Cut to: moments later, Marta climbing the trellis. It's easy going until a piece BREAKS under her foot, and she swings for a second by one hand.
HARLAN (V.O.) (cont'd)
And for godssakes don't make any
noise.
INT. THIRD FLOOR LANDING - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
What appears to be a dead end hallway, with a painting at the end. BUT suddenly the end wall swings away like a door, revealing a WINDOW behind it. Marta heaves her way in through it, and steps lightly into Harlan's bedroom.
44.
HARLAN (V.O.)
Once you're inside, this is the
tricky part.
MARTA (V.O.)
THIS is the tricky part?
INT. HARLAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
HARLAN (V.O.)
Get my robe and cap from my bedroom.
And put them on.
She picks them up from the bed.	Stops.	A moment of doubt.
INT. HARLAN THROMBEY'S STUDY - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
Back to the scene with Harlan.	Marta stops him.
MARTA
Harlan this is - I - this is crazy -
HARLAN
We need to make this so airtight your average cop will entirely dismiss you as a suspect. This seems crazy but it will work.
INT. HARLAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
Marta in the robe, pulling the cap on, tucking her hair under it.
INT. SECOND FLOOR LANDING - NIGHT OF PARTY - FLASHBACK
Marta, in Harlan's robe and cap, creeps down the creaky stairs, then keeps going down.
HARLAN (V.O.)
Walt and Jacob are smoking outside.
They'll see you... 
INT. FOYER - NIGHT OF PARTY - FLASHBACK
Marta come down the stairs, and sees the outline of Walt and Jacob outside through the glazed window windows.
45.
HARLAN (V.O.)
... through the glazed window.
She holds her breath, a deer in the headlights.
WALT
Dad, go to bed.
Marta heads right back up the stairs.
HARLAN (V.O.)
You were seen leaving, the security cameras show you driving off, and twenty minutes later I am seen alive and well by my son.
INT. SECOND FLOOR LANDING - NIGHT
Marta climbs the creaky stairs.
HARLAN (V.O.)
You've gone from suspect number one to an impossibility.
INT. HARLAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Marta ducks in, ditching the robe and cap on the bed.
EXT. THROMBEY ESTATE SIDE YARD - NIGHT
Marta shimmies down the last of the trellis.
HARLAN (V.O.)
Leave the way you came.	And don't.
Be.	Seen.
She hops to the ground, then FREEZES and almost shouts.
She's facing a darkened first floor window. Wide open. And inside it, staring RIGHT AT her, is Greatnana.
Marta is frozen. Greatnana isn't moving either. Just has her eyes locked on Marta.
After what seems like forever, Greatnana cocks her head slightly and asks... 
GREATNANA
Ransom?	Are you back again already?
46.
Marta breathes. And backs away. Then turns and goes, quickly, down across the lawn.
HARLAN (V.O.)
Drive home. Sometime in the next few days the police will question you.
INT. HARLAN THROMBEY'S STUDY - NIGHT
Back to Harlan and Marta.
MARTA
Harlan I can't lie I'll puke
HARLAN
Don't lie. Tell fragments of the truth. In this exact order:
INT. LIBRARY - LATE AFTERNOON
Blanc catches his coin. Lieutenant Elliott and Trooper Wagner look up at Marta, expectant. Just a brief moment has passed since we left them.
MARTA
I took him upstairs. We played our nightly game of GO, at some point he knocked the board over and Joni came up to check on us. Then I gave him pain medication, he pulled his shoulder last week, and left him in his study. At midnight. Said bye to Walt, went home.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
What medication did he get?
Marta chooses her words very carefully:
MARTA
Since his injury I've been giving him a 100 milligram IV push of Toradol, a non narcotic analgesic. And to help him sleep, 3 milligrams of morphine.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Anything unusual about his demeanor?
Uh oh.	Marta keeps it solid. Superhuman effort.
47.
MARTA
No.
The three men nod. Blanc holds Marta's gaze. She holds it right back. Then he smiles.
BLANC
Well that sounds about right. Thank you Ms. Cabrera.
INT. FOYER - MOMENTS LATER
Marta walks calmly out of the library. Then across the foyer into a small door.
INT. HALF BATH
Marta walks in, closes the door behind her, locks it, turns on both the taps, and PUKES into the toilet.
INT. LINDA'S ROOM
Linda stands in her childhood room, by the window in the ebbing light. From a shelf she pulls a stack of PINK NOTECARDS, identical to the one Harlan showed Richard in his office. But these are covered in writing, sweet little notes, a father to his daughter.
WALT (O.S.)
Hey sis. People are going to start getting here for the memorial pretty soon. Are you- Are you alright?
She looks up. Walt in the doorway. She wipes her eyes, indicates the notes.
LINDA
I was just thinking about Dad's games. This all feels like one, it feels like something he'd write, not do. I keep waiting for a big reveal, where it all makes sense. How nice would that be?
Her little brother hugs her.	His eyes tired and dark.
48.
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
HARLAN THROMBEY - his portrait, with an ambiguous look on his face.
Marta.	Soda water in hand at the reception that night.
Staring shell shocked at Harlan.
The reception for friends of the family. Tables of food. Twenty or thirty people milling, in dark tasteful clothes, with the whole Thrombey family.
A tearful Fran has cornered Marta, talks through sobs:
FRAN
I don't think he killed himself I don't. I don't. There's this Hallmark movie Deadly By Surprise where Danica McKellar plays a wife who gets poisoned by her husband but bit by bit so she thinks she's going crazy and she ends up killing herself, and my cousin who's the receptionist at the medical examiners office says that kind of thing can totally happen, she says it's not even like 3% as crazy as stuff she's seen come through the -
As Fran's talking, Marta looks at the room of family members, gathered around talking. She FLASHES BACK to:
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT OF PARTY - FLASHBACK - NIGHT
NIGHT OF THE PARTY
Harlan and Ransom go off together to have a private talk, leaving the family having a heated conversation in the living room.
RICHARD
I don't like him no he's an asshole but maybe an asshole's what we needed
oh uh huh yeah there you go
Marta stays on the outskirts.
champagne flutes:
JONI
Oh god. Yeah an asshole's what Germany needed in nineteen thirty ever
Fran, with a tray of
49.
FRAN
Jesus. I'm gonna disappear until the politics talk is done. You want some champers?
MARTA
No I'm technically working.	Thanks.
Marta checks her watch. Meanwhile Donna, who's had a few, is tearing into the family fight.
DONNA
We're losing our way of life and our culture, there's millions of Mexicans coming and this isn't Joni don't make this a race thing, I'd say the same thing if they were European immigrants - we allow them in and they think they own what's ours
JONI
Oh god really - yeah it's not a race thing yeah
Oh yeah, if the Swiss were clogging in the streets - They're putting. Children. In cages. I mean these are camps.
RICHARD
Nobody's saying that isn't
bad, but I blame the parents
JONI
For wanting a better life for their kids, isn't that what America
RICHARD
For breaking the law. You're going to hate hearing this but it's true, America is for Americans. Marta, come here.
Richard beckons her over, waving his cake plate. We've seen this moment before, silent, during Richard's questioning.
LINDA
Oh god don't.
Marta is drawn over next to Richard, very uncomfortable.
RICHARD
No, Marta your family came from Uruguay but you did it right, she did it legally, I'm saying. You work hard, and you'll earn your share from the ground up just like dad and all of us did - Marta I bet you agree with me.
50.
LINDA
Leave the poor girl alone.
RICHARD
No Marta do you agree, I'd like you to answer - you wanna become an American, there are legal ways to do it, but if you break the law it doesn't matter if you have a good heart, you gotta face the consequences.
At that moment booming shouts begin behind the study door - Harlan and Ransom going at it. Ransom bursts out.
Marta takes the opportunity to slip into the hallway, alone.
She breathes hard.	Takes a champagne flute from the tray.
Drinks it in one gulp.
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
END FLASHBACK. Marta in the same spot, Fran still talking her ear off. The room sways. Marta sucks in breath, sways, and braces herself against the wall.
FRAN
Oh my god Marta, what?
Meg runs over, rubs her back.
MEG
Whoa hey, c'mere, hey. What do you, you want water? Breathe. Hey. Fran have you still got your stash?
INT. DRAWING ROOM - NIGHT
Empty and dark, fireplace blazing. Above the fireplace is an ornate mantle clock. Fran uses a key to unlock one of several tiny drawers hidden in its face, takes out a joint and hands it to Meg.
FRAN
Take em whenever you need em - they're just drying out since you gave me that Juul.
MEG
Thanks Fran.
Fran leaves them alone.
51.
I'm	MARTA	MEG
sorry I'm sorry I'm	Stop saying you're sorry
sorry	Jesus
Meg	lights the joint.
MARTA
God my heart won't stop, I can't - it's just everything, no, thank you
she refuses the joint, then realizes where it came from.
MARTA (cont'd)
That's where Fran keeps her stash?
MEG
Who's going to open a clock?
INT. LIVING ROOM
Walt yells at a non responsive, bored Greatnana.
WALT
DO YOU WANT DINNER, NANA?
DINNER?	TO EAT?	EAT?
LINDA
Walt she's fine, she ate the whole salmon spread already.
Meg grabs Walt, pulls him to Marta.
MEG
Did you tell Marta yet? What we all talked about?
WALT
No, not yet, is now a good time?
MEG
Yes a very good time. Right now.
WALT
Marta.	We've talked it over, and (wait)
Have you been smoking grass?
MEG
No.
WALT
We talked it over and the whole family, we want to take care of you.
MARTA
What does that mean?
52.
MEG
We all think you deserve something.
WALT
Financially, we want to help you out. You were never anything but good to dad. Because of that, you can count on us.
Walt embraces her, Meg puts a hand on her back.
Over Walt's shoulder, Marta sees Harlan's portrait again. Has its expression changed? It looks like it has a slight conspiratorial smile. Marta breathes - maybe this is all going to be ok.
WALT (cont'd)
I thought you should have been at the funeral, by the way. I was outvoted.
EXT. SIDE PORCH - NIGHT
Later.	Marta comes out to get some air.	Exhales deeply.
And then jumps - she's not alone. Benoit Blanc sits in a wicker chair in the dark, smoking a long thin cigar.
MARTA
Wah ha. Detective. You're still here?
BLANC
Mm.
Silence.	Blanc smokes and stares at Marta.	Marta shifts.
MARTA
Did you know Harlan?
BLANC
He knew my father who was a police detective. Years ago. My father respected Harlan. That says quite a lot.
MARTA
So that's why you're here?
BLANC
Here now here? No. I stayed hoping to speak to you a little more.
53.
MARTA
Uh?
BLANC
Something is afoot with this whole affair. I know it, and I believe you know it.
MARTA
So you're...  going to keep digging.
BLANC
Harlan's detectives they dig, they rifle and root, truffle pigs. I anticipate the terminus of gravity's rainbow.
MARTA
Gravity's Rainbow.
BLANC
It's a novel.
MARTA
I know.	I haven't read it.
BLANC
Neither have I. Nobody has. But I like the title. It describes the path of a projectile, determined by natural law. Voila, my method. I observe the facts without biases of the head or heart, I determine the arc's path, stroll leisurely to its terminus, and the truth falls at my feet.
(beat)
The medical examiner was ready to rule this a suicide, but Elliott agreed to keep it pending for forty eight hours. Tomorrow morning I search the grounds and the house, begin my investigation. I want you to be by my side for it. My confidant, my eyes and ears.
MARTA
What but - why me?
54.
BLANC
I trust your kind heart. Also you are the only one who had nothing to gain from Harlan's death. So. Watson.
Blank puts out his cigar, stands.
MARTA
You want my insight into this family? None of them are murderers. That's my insight.
BLANC
And yet. Be it cruel or comforting, this machine unerringly arrives at the truth. That's what it does.
MARTA
Always?
He does a little bow.
BLANC
Tomorrow at eight.
Marta watches him go.
INT. CABRERA LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Marta gets home. Her mom is on the couch, zoning out in front of the TV, still in a cleaning uniform. Without a word Marta sits next to her. Stares at the TV.
Off her eyes, we FLASH BACK with her:
INT. HARLAN THROMBEY'S STUDY - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
HARLAN
I know I missed something...  there's going to be something I missed. But I know you can beat it. Without losing your soul you have to do what you have to do to beat this, and win.
MARTA
I can't.
HARLAN
You can and you have to.	For me.
Right now.
55.
She's out the door and he shuts it.
INT. OUTSIDE HARLAN'S ATTIC OFFICE DOOR - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
Marta stands frozen. Soft voices of Walt and Jacob float up from downstairs. She turns back to the door.
Silence.	Moments going by.	Shit.	Can she do this?	Shit.
No.	She turns and pushes back into the office -
INT. HARLAN THROMBEY'S STUDY - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
MARTA
Harlan I have to get you help -
Harlan reclines on the couch in the middle of the room, ornate dagger against his throat. Marta's eyes go wide.
HARLAN
Do what I say and everything's going to be ok, Marta. I promise.
She makes a move to stop him and with one quick motion he DRAWS THE DAGGER across his throat. Blood sprays.
She leaps back, hands to her mouth, spins and leaves the room, closing the door behind her.
EXT. THIRD FLOOR LANDING - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
Breathing hard, silent crying. Then her breathing slows. Her brain taking over. Resolve settling. The dice are thrown. She wipes her eyes. Then bounds down the stairs, out of frame.
INT. CABRERA LIVING ROOM
Back to Marta and her mom on the couch. She puts her hand on Mom's knee.
MARTA
Everything's going to be ok.	I
promise.
MOM
(of course)
I know.
56.
They go back to watching TV.	But Marta's mind is buzzing.
On her white sneaker, we see but she does not - one single drop of blood.
EXT. THROMBEY ESTATE GUARD GATE - MORNING
The gate is open, Marta's car pulls up just inside it. The small Guard house next to the gate, Blanc, Elliott and Wagner outside it. Blanc waves to her.
INT. GUARD HOUSE
Thrombey's security man, MR PROOFROC, guides them into the cramped dusty space. Proofroc is old and salty. He shows them old photos of the house, stuck to a steel fridge with big brightly colored fruit magnets.
MR PROOFROC
Fifty years I worked this estate, you know security back then meant making the rounds with a 94, keeping your ears open. Before all this modern technology.
Nothing in the room is newer than 1988. An 8 inch CRT monitor shows a phosphorescent live feed of the road outside the gate, and a top loaded VHS VCR sits next to it.
MR PROOFROC (cont'd)
Well the video here, I saved the tape
from that night, usually I erase 'em
with the magnetic de-gauser, but I
thought better save that one.	Cause,
security.	That's the live feed
there.
Marta notices something with alarm - the video feed shows the road outside, and at the top edge you can just barely see the carved elephant that marks the gardener's utility road. She realizes Harlan said
HARLAN (V.O.)
... to avoid the security cameras, pull off the road AFTER the carved elephant.
Marta keeps a poker face, but.. shit.

LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
(to Proofroc)
Can we see the actual TAPE?
MR PROOFROC
Oh sure.
CLACK! The tape loads into the mechanical VCR. An impossibly grainy, smeared night vision view of the road outside the gate. Time stamp: 10:02pm.
TROOPER WAGNER
It's like a Japanese horror movie.
MR PROOFROC
(proud)
I record it SSLP, gets eight hours per tape. Nine pm to five am.
Can	BLANC	MARTA
we -	(to Proofroc)
Can	(to Marta)
we scan forward?	Can we scan forward?
MR PROOFROC
Hold the play button down and press the FF down halfway till you feel it grind.
Wagner does, the machine makes horrible noises and the picture frizzles and frazzles. Then stops and ejects.
MR PROOFROC (cont'd)
And hold the tape down or it'll
eject.
BLANC
Can your guys digitize it so we can scan it properly?
TROOPER WAGNER
I'm sure we can.
MARTA
I got it.
Marta grabs the tape from the VCR.
EXT. WOODS - DAY
They all hack through the overgrown gardener's path.
58.
TROOPER WAGNER
You know all these statues that you see around here - they are all straight out of his series the "menagerie tragedy series", pretty cool.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
(dry)
Awesome. Blanc the grounds are lovely but you think what, someone broke into the house? To kill Harlan? Is that why we're out here?
BLANC
I think it's an unlikely but if they did, there will be traces.
TROOPER WAGNER
I'll take that, thanks ma'am.
Marta hands Wagner the VHS tape. Then she discretely pockets something she had held in her hand next to it - a few of the bright fruit MAGNETS from Proofroc's fridge.
EXT. THROMBEY ESTATE SIDE YARD
The group hikes up out of the woods, towards the low wall with a small pedestrian gate that leads to the east lawn.
Marta is out in front. During the following, she notices something: The earth around and under the gate is soft and bare. And clear as day: HER FOOTPRINTS from the other night, the only ones from women's shoes. The same ones she has on now. Her breath catches. SHIT.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Any luck with - whatshisname?
TROOPER WAGNER
Ransom.	No, but we have an address.
Ten Kenoak street.
BLANC
Ten Kenoak. That's a pleasant thing to say. kenoak. I awoke amid Kenoak.
TROOPER WAGNER
Ugh this mud, my boots are going to stink.
59.
BLANC
Mud - has it rained the past week?
No - Nobody move!	Freeze!	Everyone!
These footprints must not be
disturbed!
(sees)
Marta!
Marta has already walked through the pedestrian gate and up onto the lawn, stepping in her pre-existing prints. She turns back, playing dumb.
MARTA
What?
BLANC
Don't - stop there, don't -
MARTA
I can't hear you, what?
She trots back to them through the gate, stepping into her returning prints.
BLANC
No no no no don't - don't step on the, ok, alright. Aughhhhh ok.
MARTA
What?
Blanc sidesteps up to the gate, not stepping in the mud.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Alright, Wagner let's get the boys on
it, check the prints, tape off this
area, keep it clear.
The dogs come running down the lawn, barking at the men.
They tear through the gate, further messing up the mud.
MARTA
Hey boys, easy.	Hey.	Hey.
She pets them and they quiet down.
BLANC
Best judge of character is a dog.
I've found that to be true.
The dogs start BARKING and bolt towards the house, where Richard and Linda are pulling up in their lux SUV.
60.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT They're doing the will reading at ten, whole family will be here soon.
Elliott heads up towards the house. Blanc meanders up the lawn, and Marta follows.
MARTA
I've never been to a will reading.
BLANC
You think it'll be like a game show. No. Imagine a community theater performance of a tax return.
They approach the side of the house. Blanc does a gentle, meandering study of the layout.
Marta steals a look at the trellis she climbed.
Oh no. A piece of the white lattice trellis that broke off when she was climbing - about eight inches long - lies in the grass beneath it. Her eyes dart up - yup, there's the broken spot. Shit.
BLANC (cont'd)
SWEET BEANS
Marta starts - did he spot it? No - he's come face to face with Greatnana, standing stock still on the porch. She stares at him like a bird.
BLANC (cont'd)
Good morning Mrs. Thrombey.
He approaches her, slowly. When his back is fully turned Marta takes her shot and KICKS the piece of trellis under some thick bushes at the base of the house.
Blanc and Greatnana stare at each other. Blanc gets very close to her, great sympathy in his eyes. Greatnana stares back. It's almost like they're communicating. This goes on for a little too long. Then Blanc breaks from the trance, and turns to Marta.
BLANC (cont'd)
Do you think you could handle the study?
61.
INT. HARLAN THROMBEY'S STUDY
The blood is now only a subtle dark stain, but other than that the room has been left intact from the night of the party. Marta and Wagner observe as Blanc paces the room.
BLANC
(to Marta)
Where's your medical bag?
MARTA
I...  don't know - I left it here, I always leave it with Harlan at night.
TROOPER WAGNER
They must have taken it in as
evidence.	I'll check on it.
Blanc picks up the GO board and sets it on the table.
Examines its grid idly.
BLANC
How'd the GO board get knocked over?
MARTA
We were just goofing around.
(beat)
What are you thinking?
Blanc sighs gently, turns the baseball over in his hands.
Looks like this was a bust.
Blanc tips the GO board over, and it lands on the carpet with a nearly inaudible WHOMPH. He stares at it.
But his concentration is broken by sharp barking outside. They go to the tiny window and look out. A DASHING MAN in his early 30s climbs out of a vintage Porsche. The dogs go NUTS, biting at his pant legs.
BLANC
Let me guess.
EXT. THROMBEY ESTATE FRONT DRIVE
The man kicks off the dogs and limps toward the house, cursing. Lieutenant Elliott and Trooper Wagner step out onto the porch.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Hugh Drysdale?
62.
RANSOM
Ransom. Call me Ransom, my middle name. The help call me Hugh.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT I'm Lieutenant Elliott, this is officer Wagner, we'd like to ask you a few questions about the night of
RANSOM
Uh huh.
He blows past them and into the house.
