INT. LIVING ROOM
Walt, Donna and Jacob (nose in his phone) sit around the room. Linda and Richard stand, on their phones. Ransom breezes in, bumping Donna who YELPS, startled.
Elliott and Wagner follow.
TROOPER WAGNER
Sir excuse me, we are officers of the law.
RANSOM
You gonna run me in? I don't feel like talking. I'm distraught.
Ransom disappears into the kitchen, comes out eating a sleeve of pinwheel cookies.
Blanc and Marta slip in.	Elliott nods to Blanc.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT Blanc, anything you need to ask him?
RANSOM
The hell anyway is this arrangement?
BLANC
Mr. Drysdale
Ransom sizes up Blanc with a grin.
RANSOM
CSI KFC?
Ransom grabs Fran the housekeeper's sleeve as she walks by.
63.
RANSOM (cont'd)
Hey Frannie can you get me a glass of cold milk?
Meg and Joni have just entered, and Meg heard this.
MEG
Hey asshole. Not her name, not her job.
Fran walks off with a scorching look at Ransom.
Meg.
RANSOM
How's your SJW degree coming?
MEG
Trust fund prick.
Alright.
JONI
Guys.
ALAN STEVENS, the family's attorney, knocks and enters with an assistant, SALLY, who juggles several attache cases.
ALAN
Hey everyone. Hey. I'm just going to set up in the other room, be ready in ten minutes.
They go off to the library, leaving the family all together in tense silence.
WALT
Funny Ransom, you skipped the funeral but you're early for the will reading.
JONI
Ok, people grieve in different ways, let's not
WALT
(to Ransom)
It's funny you're here at all. Why are you even bothering, that's what I want to know.
RICHARD
What's that supposed to mean?
WALT
He knows what it means.
LINDA
Walt, what?
64.
WALT
Jacob was in that bathroom the night of the party.
JONI
Is that where you were all night?
RICHARD
The hell were you doing in the
bathroom all night?
JACOB
Nothing.
MEG
Swatting Syrian refugees.
JACOB
No.
MEG
Alt right troll.
JACOB
Liberal snowflake.
WALT
I don't know what any of that means
RICHARD
It means your son's a little creep.
WALT
Oh MY son's a creep?
JONI
Guys!	Walt he was in the bathroom... 
WALT
He was in the bathroom
RICHARD
Joylessly masturbating to pictures of dead deer.
WALT
Ok you wanna go?
They go at each other and do some half-hearted slap-fighting before Linda and Joni break them apart. Ransom's loving this.
65.
RANSOM
We gotta do this more often.
LINDA
Alright! Enough. Jacob, we get where this is going. The bathroom's next to Harlan's office, where he had the big fight with Ransom. You heard something. Spill it.
JACOB
I just heard two things.
INT. HALF BATH - NIGHT OF PARTY - FLASHBACK
Jacob on the toilet, hearing non distinct yelling through a vent high in the wall. But two words poke through:
HARLAN (O.S.)
... my will!
INT. LIVING ROOM
JACOB
And then there was more shouting, but I also heard Ransom say "I'm warning you."
Walt raises his arms, triumphant.
LINDA
Ransom?	What's this mean?
He just eats cookies, silent.
WALT
It means dad finally came to his senses and cut this worthless lazy brat out of the will.
(to Ransom)
And you better sell your little Beamer and you better give your notice at that country club and kick whatever fashion drugs you're on cause if you think after the bridges you've burned, the shit you've said and what you've put this family through for the past ten years that any of us are going to support you, are going to give you like dad used to say a single red dime you're nuts.
66.
Ransom looks around the room.	Cold faces.
RICHARD
Son.
RANSOM
(mock gravity)
Father?
RICHARD
Did Harlan tell you he was cutting you out of the will?
RANSOM
Yes.
RICHARD
Then he's done what we weren't strong enough to do - this might finally make you grow up.
Ransom is really slapped by this but he doesn't let it show.
LINDA
I think it might be the best thing that could happen to you.
RANSOM
Thanks - my mother, folks.
JONI
It won't be easy for you but it'll be good. Nothing good is ever easy.
RANSOM
Up your ass Joni, you've got your teeth bit into this family tit so hard
MEG
Oh 'up your ass' very nice you homophobic privileged -
RANSOM
(going down the line)
As a matter of fact - Eat shit, hows that? In fact eat shit, eat shit - eat shit - Definitely eat shit. Eat shit.
And now everyone is shouting at each other.
Blanc has heard enough. He sets the baseball down on a side table, and drifts out. Marta follows him.
67.
EXT. FRONT PORCH
Blanc breathes in the air. Marta joins him. From inside the house, the shouting continues.
MARTA
What was that about will readings being boring?
BLANC
Exception that proves the rule.
Fran bursts out of the living room, muttering
FRAN
Asshole.
She storms off around the house.	A beat of thought.	Then:
BLANC
I'm warning you. Ransom said. I'm warning you.
One of the dogs bounds up the steps to Blanc.
MARTA
You heard Ransom in there, it's the kind of thing he says.
When Blanc goes to pet him, the dog drops something to his feet with a clatter. Marta freezes.
MARTA (cont'd)
What's he got there? Hey boy. You find a stick? He's always bringing junk into the house -
It's the piece of broken trellis. Blanc picks it up, examines it, and suddenly his eyes go sharp.
EXT. THROMBEY ESTATE SIDE YARD
Holding the piece up as he studies the trellis that runs up the side of the house. Marta runs up beside him.
BLANC
This looks like a relatively fresh break - yes. Right there.
He's spotted the broken spot on the trellis. Just up from it, what looks like a boarded window.
68.
BLANC (cont'd)
Wait - that doesn't make sense,
where's that window?
INT. LIVING ROOM
The whole family in a screaming match, but Blanc and Marta walk through and up the stairs. Three people notice: Elliott and Wagner (who follow) and Ransom (who doesn't.)
INT. THIRD FLOOR LANDING
Blanc looks down the "dead end" hallway. Marta joins him, out of breath.
BLANC
Show me, but don't step on the
carpet.
It's a runner rug, and Marta delicately steps on the wood siding as she goes to the wall with the painting. And swings it open, revealing the window.
TROOPER WAGNER
It's the trick window!	From "A Kill
For All Seasons!"
Elliott and Wagner at the top of the stairs, and Blanc motions them not to approach.
BLANC
Off the carpet!
He drops down to his knees, removes a loupe from his jacket, and holds it in his eye. Then, his face inches from the carpet, he scans it. All the way to the window. Then stops.
BLANC (cont'd)
Traces of dried mud. I suspect they go the length of the hallway.
MARTA
Footprints?
BLANC
No, just traces.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT Depending on when it was last cleaned, it could be from anytime
69.
BLANC
But that would not explain this.
He motions to the base of the window sill - obvious scuffs of dried mud. Marta winces.
Blanc tosses the piece of trellis to Elliott.
BLANC (cont'd)
Analyze this mud. It will match these traces, and you will find similar samples leading up the trellis on the side of the house.
(beat)
On the night of the party, somebody who did not want to be heard climbing the steps went to a great deal of trouble to break into Harlan Thrombey's rooms. The game is afoot, eh Watson?
INT. LIBRARY - MINUTES LATER
The whole family assembled. Marta stands in the back, with Blanc, Elliott and Trooper Wagner.
Alan Stevens, Harlan's attorney, sits at a table with papers in front of him, assistant Sally beside him.
ALAN
Well. Thank you all for getting together like this, it isn't legally necessary but I thought because you're all in town and some of you are leaving soon, it would be best -
BLANC
Excuse me Mr. Stevens. As to that, ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to gently request you all remain in town until the investigation is completed. Shouldn't be more than two days.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
He's gently requesting, I'm ordering.
Nobody move until we figure this out.
Nobody likes this.
LINDA
What?
70.
JONI
Can we ask why?	Has something
changed?
BLANC
No.
JONI
No it hasn't changed or no we can't ask?
BLANC
Mr. Stevens, please continue.
ALAN
Right. Well the other reason I thought this gathering would be, uh, beneficial is that as I told Walt, Harlan altered his will one week ago. He sealed it and asked me not to submit it to the courts for probate until after his death. So in case there's any confusion about anything we're all together, we can talk. I can't imagine any of it will be that complicated, Harlan's assets included um
SALLY
... the house
ALAN
the house which he owned outright, um
SALLY
sixty million
ALAN
right in various cash accounts and investments, yes and of course the real assets are sole ownership of um
SALLY
Blood Like Wine
ALAN
Blood Like Wine publishing, his
publishing company.	Ok.
Walt's wife puts her hand on his knee. He squeezes it, smiled tightly.
71.
ALAN (cont'd)
Um, he did write up a statement when he made the recent changes, he wanted it read first, so:
(reads)
"Some of you may be surprised by the choice I've made here. No pleasure was taken in the exclusion, and its purpose was not to sow greater discord in the family, quite the opposite. Please accept it with grace and without bitterness. But do accept it. It's for the best."
Gently condescending eyes shift to Ransom. Linda sees this, puts her hand on her son's hand, and he immediately gets up and moves to a chair in the corner.
Alan's assistant hands him an envelope and he removes a single sheet of paper with one short typed paragraph.
ALAN (cont'd)
Ok. So - oh wow, yeah, not complex at all. This'll be quick. "I Harlan Thrombey, being of sound mind and body, yada yada, my assets both liquid and otherwise, I leave in their entirety to Marta Cabrera. My entire ownership of Blood Like Wine publishing I leave in its entirety to Marta Cabrera. The copyright of its catalog likewise I leave in its entirety to Marta Cabrera.
The air around Marta's head goes away.	The room spins
She's not sure what's happening.	Blanc is looking at her.
The whole family is looking at her.
Walt bursts out of his chair and grabs the will
WALT
No.
LINDA
No.
WALT
No.	What?
(beat)
That can't be - that can't be right
72.
RICHARD	WALT
What the genuine shit	That can't be right it's
right
It's right	ALAN
Donna begins to hyperventilate. She puts her head between her knees, breathes deep.
LINDA
No no no no Alan this can't be legal, there are, we're his family
WALT	RICHARD
We're his	family, Alan he
obviously	wasn't,
something	- I don't know	Are there safeguards against
what but something wasn't
right here		this?
And from the back of the room, slowly rising above the din of confusion and cursing, slowly drawing even Marta's deer in the headlights attention...  Ransom. LAUGHING. Loud and weirdly sincerely, tears down his cheeks, laughing his head off.
JONI
Alan there's a mistake
MEG
Mom if it's what granddad wanted
JONI
No this is a mistake, this is ours.
LINDA
Alan take that piece of paper and shove it up your ass and get out. And you cops, out!
They don't but Ransom slips out, his child-like laughter trailing after him.
RICHARD
Linda -
LINDA
No, we need to talk and we need to fight this thing and we're not going anywhere. GET OUT! We're the Thrombeys goddammit! This is still our house!
73.
A beat of silence. Then all eyes go to Alan. Who looks down at the will. His assistant Sally points helpfully.
ALAN
Sorry, there's, uh. "Likewise the house at two Deerborn Drive and all belongings therein I leave to Marta Cabrera.
Linda goes for Marta.
LINDA
You little bitch. Did you know about this? What did you do to him to make this happen, were you two what were you boinking my father?
Marta recoils, stumbles back.
'Boinking?'	MEG
Linda!	RICHARD
JACOB	WALT
Anchor baby.	Marta!  Jacob!  And Linda -
please!
JONI
Linda please - Marta, you need to tell us though,
WALT
Yes Marta, did dad discuss this with you?
JONI
You need to tell us everything you know about this and we need to talk about this,
WALT
This isn't what dad wanted, this isn't fair but we can work this out
RICHARD
Jesus don't mob the girl, let's talk about this
The whole family is coming towards her like zombies. Blanc takes her by the arm and steers her towards the door.
BLANC
I think heads have to cool a little, and in the meanwhile I'd maybe run.
74.
EXT. THROMBEY ESTATE FRONT DRIVE
Marta stumbles out of the house in a daze. Behind her, the entirety of the family floods out after her, shouting reassurances and questions and accusations and a general din of confusion.
MARTA
I - I have no idea why he - I just
need to think - I'll call you or have
him call me or do something I don't
know
She gets in her car and slams the door, and it's instantly like A Hard Day's Night - the family gathered around trying to talk through the window and rapping to get her attention.
Marta keys the ignition - chug chug chug. Nothing. Oh god, not now - chug chug chug. It won't turn over.
Richard opens the door, she pulls it closed again and locks it, this is like a horror movie. Blanc is trying to get the family to back off but no dice.
Marta puts her head in her hands, all of it swirling and echoing and horrifying, she has no idea what to do.
HONK!
She turns - a honking car pulls up right beside her and through the family crowd she sees Ransom in his Porsche, waving "get in." With no other options she pushes out of her car and through the family and JUMPS IN with him.
As he GUNS IT and careens out of the driveway he shouts back at the family with a wave
RANSOM
I think this could be the best thing to happen to all of you!
And they're gone.	The family keeps shouting at each other.
Blanc watches the Porsche recede, his expression unreadable. DING! His phone buzzing. He checks it. His expression darkens.
INT. RANSOM'S PORSCHE
Tearing down the private road, away from the house. He's still laughing, she's still shell shocked. Slowly, his laughter eases to a stop. A moment of silence.
75.
RANSOM
Ok seriously though, what the hell?
She shakes her head, looks at him.	What the hell indeed.
EXT. ROADSIDE FAMILY RESTAURANT - LATER
The Porsche parked out front.
INT. RESTAURANT - CORNER BOOTH
Tucked into a dark corner, Marta is miserable. Ransom is bemused, but regards her closely.
They sit in silence.	A waitress sets a sausage plate down.
RANSOM
(to the waitress)
Could we get an extra bowl please?
(to Marta)
You look like you're gonna pass out.
Have you eaten all day?	Eat.
She joylessly shovels food in her mouth, starving.
MARTA
This is a nightmare.
RANSOM
Uh huh.	So why.
MARTA
Why
RANSOM
Why. Hey, this is everything. There has to be a bigger reason why and you know it.
MARTA
Well Ransom how about it had more to do with you guys than with me.
RANSOM
(agrees)
Yeah.
(beat)
Yeah that's the only thing that makes sense.
76.
Marta is unexpectedly effected by this. The waitress breezes by, sets an empty bowl on the table.
MARTA
Did he tell you anything?
RANSOM
Just I wasn't getting a cent.
MARTA	RANSOM
He wanted you to build	something from the ground
something from the ground
up, like your parents	up, like my parents
RANSOM (cont'd)
yeah.  My mom built her business from
the ground up with a million dollar
loan from granddad.  My dad owns none
of it, and mom made him sign a
prenup.  He lives in fear.
I know that's what granddad wanted to
protect me from by doing this, and I
know I shouldn't say this out loud
but when he told me, Jesus Christ I
coulda killed him.
(beat)
After I left the party, though.  I
was driving fast, nowhere, just in
the night.  And I got this weird... 
clarity.  That from here on I was
going to have to do for myself.  And
that felt...  good.  The old bastard.
(beat)
Marta I know three things.  One: I
know he didn't commit suicide.
MARTA
What makes you think that
RANSOM
I don't think it. I know it. Cause I knew my granddad. So you're not going to bullshit me. Because two: I know lying makes you puke. Cause of that mafia game last fourth of July.
Marta sinks back, suddenly nervous.
RANSOM (cont'd)
And three. I know that you just ate a full plate of sausage and baked beans.
77.
She looks down at her empty plate. Oh no. He pushes the large empty bowl in front of her.
RANSOM (cont'd)
So look me in the eye. And tell me what really happened to my granddad.
Her lip quivers. She looks like she might attempt it. But then tears drop from her eyes.
MARTA
You bastard.
Ransom pull the bowl away, and puts his hand on hers.
RANSOM
Marta.	Tell me everything.
EXT. THROMBEY ESTATE - EVENING
Dusk settles heavy.	Warm light from the windows.
WALT (O.S.)
There have to be options here.
ALAN (O.S.)
No. I don't know how many times I can repeat the same two simple pieces of information.
INT. LIVING ROOM - EVENING
Lit by a fire in the fireplace, the whole family pacing around, Alan the lawyer looking very tired seated at a table in the center of the room.
ALAN
If Harlan was of sound mind when he made the changes, and we've all confirmed he was
RICHARD
Would a sound person do this! Sound how?
LINDA
The very action speaks to unsoundness!
ALAN
not legally no, you not liking what they did does not speak to testamentary capacity.
78.
JACOB
What about undue influence?
WALT
Yes!	Undue influence!
ALAN
(weary)
Did you just google that?
WALT
If Marta was manipulating dad somehow, if we found out that she had
LINDA
Gotten her hooks into him
WALT
Somehow or something
ALAN
You need a strong case for that. You've got nothing. "She endeared herself to him through hard work and good humor" won't cut the salami.
JONI
What about the slayer rule?
All eyes turn to her.	Her face is lit by her phone.
JONI (cont'd)
I did just google that.
ALAN
The slayer rule obviously does not apply here.
RICHARD
What the hell is the slayer rule?
JONI
It's if someone is convicted of killing the person they can't get their inheritance.
ALAN
Not even convicted, even if they're held responsible for their death in civil court
Like OJ
Like OJ, yes.	But Harlan
committed suicide.
79.
All eyes turn to Blanc, who this whole time has been sitting in a chair by the fire, lost in thought.
JONI
Detective Blank. You said that the investigation is continuing. You made a point of that. Do you suspect foul play?
BLANC
Mister Blanc.	If you please.
(beat)
There is much that remains unclear.
But yes. I suspect foul play.
The eruption you would expect breaks out.
RICHARD
Marta?
BLANC
I have eliminated no suspects.
RICHARD
You're full of shit, I don't trust this guy in the tweed suit, and Alan god bless you you're useless.
ALAN
Thank you.
Alan takes that as an excuse to leave.
RICHARD
There's one answer to this: she can renounce the inheritance.
WALT
She knows it's what she should do, it's the right thing to do.
LINDA
We've gotta make her do the right thing.
Meg rounds on her mom, speaks quietly, in tears.
MEG
Mom. If Granddad wanted Marta to have everything, that's what he wanted.
JONI
No, this was not him. He loved us, he wanted us taken care of. He wanted you to have an education.
(MORE)
80.
JONI (cont'd)
Meg. You think I can pay for your school?
This leaves Meg shaken.
INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
Beer bottles now stacked up in front of Ransom. Marta has just told Ransom everything. He stares into space, and makes the slightest hint of a laugh which I'll write as:
RANSOM
Heuh.
MARTA
I know, just saying it it sounds insane but it's all true. I think Blanc's been on to me from the start - I don't care if I go to jail, but my mom...  my sister, we can't -
Nothing but silence from Ransom. Maybe he's deep in thought. A strange glint in his eye.
MARTA (cont'd)
You going to say something?
RANSOM
I always thought I was the only one who could beat Granddad at GO. I always thought that meant something.
MARTA
I know you did.
RANSOM
At the party, that night, my last conversation with him, our last fight, that's what he told me, about you. That you beat him nearly every time. More than me. And I thought what a strange thing to tell me. But I think I get it now. I think it did mean something.
(beat)
I'm not telling the family shit. You're not going to jail. That detective is not going to catch you. And you're not giving up the family fortune.
(MORE)
81.
RANSOM (cont'd)
Think about what Granddad did to see this through, this was what he wanted not just for you but for his family, and for him. And yes for you.
You've come this far. Let me help you go all the way.
Marta looks at him hard.
MARTA
This isn't you. You could turn me in right now and get your cut of the inheritance. Why?
RANSOM
Because fuck my family. They don't deserve any of this. I can help you and we can fool them all and get away with it...  and then you will give me my cut of the inheritance. The perfect ending, we all win. You, me and Harlan. Deal?
Silence. Broken by Marta's phone ringing. On the phone ID - "MEG T"
Marta takes a breath, looks at	Ransom.  And picks it up.
Meg	MARTA
MEG (ON PHONE)		MARTA
Marta.  Oh that was nuts.		I know
MEG (ON PHONE)
Are you ok?
MARTA
Yeah are you?
MEG (ON PHONE)
I'm fine, I mean everyone's nuts, they're all going, I don't know, they've lost it. No one knows I'm calling you, I wanted to - I don't know what I wanted, I wanted to say sorry for how everyone was.
No... 
And... 
I guess I wanted to
ask... 
(beat)
What are you going to do?
82.
MARTA
What do you mean?
MEG (ON PHONE)
Well the...  with the, will. What are you going to do?
Marta looks at Ransom.	What indeed.
MARTA
What do you think I should do?
MEG (ON PHONE)
You should do what you think is...  right. I think you should give it back to us. Granddad always took care of us, we're his family, I know he was like family to you but we're his actual family. Marta you know this isn't fair, we've always been good to you and we're going to take care of you, everyone loves you and you're like family and we'll take care of you but you have to make things right, you know what's right.
Marta, keeping eye contact with Ransom. Then, her voice quavering, Meg drops what is for her the big bomb:
MEG (ON PHONE) (cont'd) Marta, mom's broke, she says I'll have to drop out of school.
MARTA
No, no.	I won't let that happen.
(beat)
Whatever money you need Meg, I'll help you. I don't want you to worry.
INT. DRAWING ROOM - NIGHT
Meg on the phone. Her face horrified, mortified, barely comprehending what she's just heard.
MARTA (ON PHONE)
I'll take care of you.	I promise.
MEG
Thanks.
MARTA (ON PHONE)
And once I get the -
83.
Meg hangs up, lets the phone drop from her ear. Tears in her eyes. She turns to her whole family gathered behind her, silent and expectant.
INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
Marta realizes the connection's dead, holds the phone in her hand like something delicate she just broke.
RANSOM
Ok then. Did the detective find anything suspicious at the house?
MARTA
(in a daze)
Mud. Tracks upstairs - where I broke in through the window.
Ransom winces.
RANSOM
Identifiable prints?
MARTA
No.
RANSOM
Good. Ok. Good. Hey. You've just gotta ride the next few days out until the investigation putters out, cause it will, cause no matter how sharp this Blanc guy is he's got nothing. Relax.
INT. MARTA'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING
She wakes to a sharp rapping at her door. Her sister Alice pokes her head in, flustered.
ALICE
Marta get your ass up, what the hell is happening? There's a guy here and a bunch of stuff, everything's going crazy, are we rich??
Marta lifts her head from her hands.
MARTA
Maybe, I dunno.
84.
ALICE
I don't even know what that means but you better get your ass up.
Marta looks at her phone - 28 missed calls.
INT. CABRERA LIVING ROOM
Marta stumbles in - Alice in front of the TV, mom pacing.
MOM
(subtitled Spanish)
Oh my god Marta what is all this, what did you do?
The TV is tuned to local news - an anchor stands outside THEIR APARTMENT BUILDING.
LOCAL NEWS ANCHOR (ON TV) ... we again we don't know much about Marta Cabrera or the exact relationship she had to Harlan Thrombey, beyond being his home nurse, and the Thrombey family has yet to release a statement... 
MARTA
Is that here?
ALICE
Oh yeah it is.	Wait so is that true?
Are we rich?
Marta looks out the blinds - several local reporters down in the streets with their vans and cameras.
MARTA
Oh my god.
EXT. THROMBEY ESTATE FRONT DRIVE - DAY
Wagner's prowler pulls up. Blanc gets out of the passenger side.
Blanc nods to the Wagner and the officer.
INT. GREATNANA'S ROOM
Dim. By an open window stands GREATNANA. Blanc enters, she turns. They look into each others eyes.
85.
BLANC
Good Morning Mrs. Thrombey.
A long pause as he thinks of exactly the right word.
BLANC (cont'd)
Why is grief the providence of youth? I don't know. But I'd imagine that age deepens all feelings. Including grief. This was a long walk to offering condolences for the loss of your son. And asking you if it isn't presumptuous of me to not think too harshly of your family, if I am as I suspect the first to console you. They're young aren't they.
Blanc sits.
BLANC (cont'd)
One thing I do assume of age is weariness. Damned if I don't get more tired every day. Tired of what I do. Following arcs, like lobbed rocks. The inevitability of truth. But the complexity and the gray lies not in the truth but what you do with the truth once you have it.
Greatnana's eyes move slightly.
BLANC (cont'd)
I think you have something you want to tell me. I think you're very perceptive and very capable of telling me what you saw the night of your son's party. But I'll happily wait. I'm in no rush. I find it quite pleasant. Sitting here with you.
He reclines, not particularly looking at her. She looks back at him. Every now and then a breeze stirs the window sheers.
86.
INT. CABRERA LIVING ROOM
MOM
Lawyers were here, very big lawyers it looked like, and some other guys I didn't know, they left all this for you and business cards, so many business cards, and there was a pile of other stuff when I got home -
Mom shovels some official looking legal letter and courier envelopes into Marta's arms.
MOM (cont'd)
(subtitled Spanish)
Hey.	I don't like this.
MARTA
(subtitled Spanish)
I don't like it either mom. I'm slipping out the back - I'll be back later, don't talk to anyone.
INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY
Dim and dingy. Marta comes out of their apartment door, then jump, startled - at the end of the hall, lurking: Walt.
MARTA
Hey.
Walt's eyes are rimmed red.	His heavy cane taps.
WALT
Hey.
They're not sure what to do so they awkwardly hug. Marta still has the envelopes in her hands.
WALT (cont'd)
How you doing?
MARTA	WALT
Well.  Walt I want you to
know I didn't know about any	I know you didn't, we all
of this.  This is
went kinda crazy yesterday
MARTA
Understandable
87.
WALT
You're still very important to all of us, I want you to know that.
MARTA
I haven't even looked at all this yet, this legal stuff, is this from you guys?
Marta flips through the envelopes, squinting.
WALT
it isn't from us. Maybe just local lawyers and accountants who saw the news and want to jump on it, I'd be careful of it all.
One envelope sticks out - a blank plain letter sized envelope, no postage, no return address.
WALT (cont'd)
Marta.	Is it your intention to
renounce the inheritance?
MARTA
This is what Harlan wanted.
WALT
Well. Harlan has put you in a very hard position here. It was unfair of him.
Walt's hand on his cane.	Gripping tight.
WALT (cont'd)
You see what this kicks up with the press and the scrutiny, and we know...  with your mother... 
MARTA
... with my mother.
Marta's spine straightens.
MARTA (cont'd)
What did Meg tell you.
WALT
This isn't about who - you're missing the point, we're not attacking you with this.
(MORE)
88.
WALT (cont'd)
Marta if your mom came here
illegally, criminally, if you come
into this inheritance with the
scrutiny that entails I'd be afraid
that could come to light.	That's
what we're all trying to avoid here.
We can protect you from that
happening, or if it happens.
MARTA
You're saying even if it came to light, with the family's resources you could help me fix it.
WALT
Yes. The right lawyers, none of those local guys but New York lawyers, DC lawyers, enough resources put towards it, yes. But there's no need it should ever even come up. But yes.
MARTA
Ok.	Good.
WALT
Ok?
MARTA
Cause Harlan gave me all your resources. So that means with my resources I'll be able to fix it. So I guess I'm going to go find the right lawyers.
WALT
Marta.
He shuffles towards her. For the first time she feels a hint of physical threat, and backs up quick into her apartment.
WALT (cont'd)
You better be sure you want to -
She slams the door
INT. CABRERA KITCHEN
and leans against it, breathing hard. But angry and focused. She dumps the legal envelopes in the trash but keeps the mysterious envelope, opens it and pulls out:
89.
Half a sheet of paper, roughly torn. A photocopy of the header of some sort of medical document, "OFFICE OF THE CHIEF MEDICAL EXAMINER" Under that, a photocopy of a tag with her name on it. And hand written in block letters at the top: "I KNOW WHAT YOU DID."
Marta's phone BUZZES, and she jumps. Caller ID: "maybe B BLANC". She hesitates, then sends it voicemail. Looks at the mysterious letter in her hands.
INT. RANSOM'S LIVING ROOM
Ransom studies the mysterious letter. Marta pushes aside a stack of New Yorkers and sits on the couch.
RANSOM
Well I don't know what this is from
Indicating the tag photocopy with her name.
MARTA
It's my medical bag tag. They have my medical bag. For some reason.
RANSOM
OK, but this is just a photocopy of the header of a blood toxicology report, from the local crime lab. On Harlan. Marta, it would show the morphine overdose.
MARTA
So I'm screwed! How do you know all this stuff?
RANSOM
I was Harlan's research assistant.
For a summer.
He sips his morning coffee.
RANSOM (cont'd)
But what kind of blackmail scheme is this? I mean the actual evidence is sitting up the street at the crime lab. What was the point of sending you this?
EXT. NORFOLK ROADS
Siren blazing, the cop car SPEEDS into town.
90.
EXT. MEDICAL EXAMINER'S OFFICE
The cop car pulls past an identifying sign into the parking lot of a one story stand alone building, joining several other cop cars, and fire trucks. Journalists kept at bay.
The building is a charred brick husk.	Black smoke, debris.
It's been gutted with an explosion and a blazing fire.
Blanc steps out of the cop car and finds Lieutenant Elliott.
BLANC
What's the cheese?
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT Five AM, security systems here was all triggered. It went up quick. Blood stores, records, all gone. No employees around, thank god.
BLANC
Any surveillance cams?
Elliott gestures wearily to the charred remains of a security camera on the smoking shell of an awning.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT And speaking of security, the security tape from the Thrombey residence was scrambled. For some reason.
Blanc unsurprised.	He motions back to the building.
BLANC
What was still pending from the
autopsy?
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
The report on the blood work.
BLANC
Blood work?
Blanc chews on this.
Across the street, Marta and Ransom pull up in her car.
INT. MARTA'S CAR
MARTA
Holy shit.	This is insane.
91.
Ransom looks at her - yeah it's likely. They both instinctively duck down in case the cops look over.
MARTA	(cont'd)	real
Who would blow up	a whole
official building	just to	blackmail
me?
RANSOM
Marta this means that the blackmailer has the only paper copy of the thing that can prove your guilt. You didn't get any other instructions, no phone call no email, no nothing?
Marta looks stunned.	She stabs at her phone, quick swipes.
MARTA
... nothing... I didn't check my email.
She shows him an email from 092832@shushmail.com. No subject line, simple text: 1209 Columbus Rd 10AM
RANSOM
That's it. 1209 Columbus Road, 10am.
Marta looks at Ransom, then at the clock on her dashboard - 9:32, then at the charred building.
EXT. MEDICAL EXAMINER'S OFFICE
Blanc looks around, deep in thought.	He spots Marta's car.
INT. MARTA'S CAR
Marta peeking up through the window.
Blanc sees her.	She sees him.	Ducks back down.	Shit.
RANSOM
You know what this means right? If you destroy that copy you are totally within the clear.
Blanc begins to walk straight towards Marta. Quickly and with purpose. Shouts something, Lieutenant Elliott follows.
RANSOM (cont'd)
Marta.	Did you hear me.
92.
Marta peeks again - Blanc coming at them full speed. Twenty paces from the car. Closing in fast.
MARTA
Yeah.
She sits up, throws the car in gear and FLOORS IT.
EXT. MEDICAL EXAMINER'S OFFICE
Her subcompact PEELS OUT and buzzes off down the road.
Blanc, crestfallen, runs back towards the cop cars in the parking lot, shouting at Elliott, who flags a cop.
INT. MARTA'S CAR
The whine of the engine, Ransom puts on his seat belt. In the rear view, siren lights as cop cars pour out of the parking lot in pursuit.
MARTA
You regret helping me yet?
RANSOM
I regret not taking the beamer.
Her phone buzzes - Blanc calling.	IGNORE.
EXT. NORFOLK ROADS
Marta buzzing down the road, cop cars a quarter mile back.

Blanc in back, Elliott in front, Trooper Wagner driving.
