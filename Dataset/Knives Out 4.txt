Marta's speedometer creeping up on 55.
93.

Her phone rings - Blanc again. She looks over - cop cars are RIGHT ALONGSIDE them. Blank holds his phone up, looks at her quizzically. Points to the phone.
RANSOM (cont'd)
This is going well.
MARTA
This is stupid, I'm pulling over
RANSOM
If you miss your shot at getting that tox report it's all over... 
MARTA
Aaauuuuuawwwaaagghhhh
She hits the brakes.
EXT. NORFOLK ROADS
Marta's car PEELS TO A STOP and the two COP CARS on either side blaze by, hitting their brakes.
She pulls off onto a SIDE STREET and into narrower city streets, down narrow alleys, using her small car to nimbly dart though small spaces.
The cops can't follow, and she loses them.
She pulls to a stop in a secluded little back lot.
INT. MARTA'S CAR
Marta, breathing hard.	Ransom is shocked.
94.
Ok.	MARTA			RANSOM
I'm all just pure
adrenaline now it's	like I
swallowed bees.	What's the	1209 Columbus road.

that report back.	Ransom.
And destroy it.
Thank you.	I couldn't do
this without you.
He smiles slightly.	A quick moment of silence between them.
Then:	RAP RAP RAP on Ransom's car window.
Blanc. Standing right outside. Marta looks in her rear view - the cop car has pulled up silently behind them. Another pulls up in front.
EXT. PARKING LOT
Ransom and Marta step out of the car, hands raised for some reason.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
That was the dumbest car chase of all time. Put your hands down.
BLANC
(to Marta)
I spoke to Wanetta Thrombey, Greatnana. The night of the party she saw someone climb the trellis to the third floor.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Mr. Drysdale, come with us please.
Elliott leads Ransom off by the elbow. Ransom throws a look back at Marta - he has no idea what's going on.
MARTA
What's going on?
BLANC
"Ransom came back" she said. I don't know what he came back to do, but we'll find out.
95.
Marta looks at Ransom - oh no. Senile Greatnana thought she was him. This is a mistake. But...  she glances at her watch - 9:51.
BLANC (cont'd)
Did he ask you to drive when he saw me coming?
Ransom's being led to the police car.	Marta decides:
MARTA
Yes.
Marta gets back in her car. She pretends to take a sip from an empty soda cup, but actually SPITS UP a little into it.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT (O.S.)
Blanc. Coming with us?
BLANC (O.S.)
(to Elliott)
I'll drive with Marta.
To Marta's horror Blanc opens her passenger door.
BLANC
Let's go to the police station, I want a full run down of everything he said to you, and I can catch you up on where we're at.
EXT. NORFOLK ROADS
Cop cars coast through town, Marta's bringing up the rear.
INT. MARTA'S CAR
Marta glances at the dashboard clock - 9:55.	Blanc, casual:
BLANC
Strange case from the start. A case with a hole in the middle. A donut. I'm just talking through my process here, let me know if this is boring.
Marta's arms are locked, her eyes steal a glance at the clock - 9:58.
BLANC (cont'd)
I feel the noose tightening - the family are truly desperate.
(MORE)
96.
BLANC (cont'd)
Desperate motives, the mystery of who hired me, the impossibility of the crime, and yet -
Up ahead, a street sign - "Columbus Road."	Marta tenses.
BLANC (cont'd)
A donut! One central piece, and if it reveals itself the fog would lift, the arc would resolve, the slinky become unkinked
MARTA
Do you mind if I stop for a second. I need to pick something up. It will be very quick.
BLANC
Sure.
EXT. NORFOLK ROADS
Marta's car makes a sharp turn, leaving the cop caravan.
EXT. 1209 COLUMBUS ROAD
A row of storefronts - 1209 is vacant. Marta's car pulls a few stores past it. She gets out of the car.
MARTA
I'll just be a few minutes.
Marta runs into a bustling hair salon.
EXT. BACK ALLEY
Marta ducks out the back door of the salon, goes two doors down to 1209, and slips into the back door.
INT. 1209 COLUMBUS ROAD
Dark, empty retail space. Lit only by the painted-over front windows. Marta edges her way in, her eyes still adjusting from the sun.
MARTA
Hello?
Her foot hits something on the dirty concrete floor.
97.
HER MEDICAL BAG.
She kneels, picks it up gently.
Next to where it was lying, she finds something else curious - the burned remnants of a piece of paper. Only a charred corner remains.
She turns her attention back to the room.	Creeps forward.
MARTA (cont'd)
Hello?
Ahead - a silhouette. A person. Seated in a chair, in the center of the room. Silent, facing her.
MARTA (cont'd)
Listen I don't know what you want. Whatever you want we can work it out, but we have to figure it out right here, right now, and I'm leaving with that report.
A beat of silence.	Nothing.	Something's not right here.
MARTA (cont'd)
Hello?
Marta takes a step closer, lifts her phone, and turns on its flashlight.
Illuminating the ghostly face of FRAN, the housekeeper.
Marta, barely breathing:
MARTA (cont'd)
Fran?
A SPIDER crawls across Fran's face. Marta STIFLES A SCREAM and leaps back, sucking in air.
A moment of stillness.	Her phone BUZZES - Blanc calling.
Marta ignores the call, frozen.
Her eyes go to: A white letter sized ENVELOPE in Fran's hand, resting on her lap.
Marta swallows. Leans in, carefully and quietly for some reason, and SLIPS the envelope from the lifeless fingers.
Unsealed. She opens it.
It is empty.
98.
Before this can even sink in, a rattling, grating DRAW OF BREATH - from Fran.
Marta starts - oh my god - and goes to her, checking a pulse, checking her eyes, lays her on her back. Fran sucks in thin breath, her eyes finding Marta in the glare of the dropped phone flashlight.
MARTA (cont'd)
Fran!	Fran!	Can you hear me?	Fran,
give me a sign if you can hear me!
FRAN
You
MARTA
Me? Fran it's Marta, you called me here, you sent me the email, I'm here. I'm going to call an ambulance and you're going to be ok but can you tell me what happened, did you take something, what's happened to you -
Weak, Fran grabs Marta's wrist, and Marta focuses on her.
FRAN
... copy...  copy
MARTA
What?
FRAN
... stashed... 
These words are barely given breath:
FRAN (cont'd)
you...  did this...  won't...  get
away.. with this
Her eyes seize. Her breath gets ragged. Marta is paralyzed with shock and fear. Fran is dying.
Marta looks at the medical bag in her hand. Then at Fran, struggling with her final breaths, eyes wide with fear.
She takes a step back from the dying Fran. Fingers tight around the medical bag. Letting her die.
But then, a decision: no. Marta dials 911 on speaker, drops to her knees and starts administering mouth to mouth.
99.
PHONE
911, what is your emergency?
EXT. 1209 COLUMBUS ROAD
Blanc sitting in the car, singing softly to himself.
BLANC
Sometimes I stand in the middle of the room...  not going left...  not going right... 
He looks at the hair salon - what's taking so long? And then sirens, as an AMBULANCE pulls up two doors down, and EMT's run into the abandoned storefront.
BLANC (cont'd)
Oh lord.
HARD CUT TO:
INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM - LATER
Marta and Blanc sitting silently in the fluorescent-lit waiting room. Marta with her face in her hands. Blanc is on his phone, mostly listening.
BLANC
(listens)
Alright my friend, thank you for the update. No I'm here with her. No need for that, I'll bring her in once we get word that the housekeeper is stable. It's still touch and go.
(listens)
Alright.
He hangs up.	Marta looks at him.
MARTA
This is over. People are getting hurt. I'm going to tell you the truth.
BLANC
Young Ransom just told Lieutenant Elliott everything. Who just told me everything.
100.
MARTA	BLANC
Good.  Wait god I hope he
didn't cover for me, did he
tell the real truth, about	Yeah
me switching the-
And the disguise and all	Yes
the-
And the blackmail with the-	Mm.
MARTA
But why did Fran take my morphine? Obviously she had swiped my bag from the house, but she didn't seem like a user to me, unless that's why she needed money... 
(beat)
I dunno, doesn't matter. I should tell the Thrombeys myself, I feel like I owe that to them.
BLANC
I don't think that's a good idea
MARTA
No, I need to do it. I won't do any of this if I can't do that. I really need to. I gave the doctors my number, they'll call if anything changes with Fran.
BLANC
We'll round up the Thrombeys at the house, along with a police escort.
MARTA
For the arrest after.
BLANC
You can tell me your whole story on the drive over. I want no more surprises.
Marta stands, a dead man walking, resigned.
EXT. NORFOLK ROADS
Marta's car drives through the scenic countryside. Inside we see but don't hear her telling a long story to Blanc, who looks at the passing countryside, brow knit.
101.
EXT. THROMBEY ESTATE FRONT DRIVE - AFTERNOON
All the family cars there, along with two police cruisers.
Marta's pulls up.
INT. MARTA'S CAR
MARTA
... said it was stashed, the copy, and then she told me "you did this, you won't get away with it" and then I called the ambulance. And that's it.
She turns the engine off.	Looks up at the house.	Breathes.
BLANC
Alright.	Are you ready?
INT. FOYER
Marta and Blanc enter. This really feels like a walk towards the gallows. Richard, Walt and Meg are there. Meg avoids eye contact with Marta.
RICHARD
Ah.	Ok, has she come to her senses?
WALT
She's standing right there Richard she can speak for herself -
BLANC
Is the rest of the family here?
WALT
In the living room.
BLANC
I think maybe, if we
could... 
Blanc beckons, and Richard and Walt file out. On her way out Meg hugs Marta, weeping.
MEG
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry I told them about your mom. I was angry and scared, I'm sorry
MARTA
It's ok, Meg. I understand. Believe me. It's alright.
Meg sniffs, dries her eyes.
102.
MEG
God I am so raiding Fran's stash
after this.
They hug one more time. Then when Meg walks off towards the living room, Marta realizes something. Blanc walks back.
BLANC
I still think this is a bad idea, but the family is assembled.
MARTA
(to Blanc)
I know where the tox report is.
INT. DRAWING ROOM
Marta jimmies the clock drawer open with a letter opener.
She pulls a FOLDED PIECE OF PAPER from inside, blows loose pot leaves off it. She hands it to Blanc.
MARTA
She practically told me where it was. Anyway this'll tie everything up. And I just handed it to you, god you're you're not much of a detective are you?
BLANC
To be fair you're a pretty lousy murderer. Perhaps we deserve each other.
INT. LIVING ROOM
The family gathered, impatient. Lieutenant Elliott and Trooper Wagner are there too, with another uniformed officer. Ransom sits in the corner, his face passive.
Marta gulps. Blanc is a few steps behind her. As she speaks, he unfolds and reads the tox report.
MARTA
Um. You guys have always been good to me. And what I'm about to say isn't going to be easy, and you're going to be upset, but especially after everything you've gone through the past few days, I thought you deserved to hear it from me.
103.
Walt smiles at her, "you're doing the right thing." Marta takes a deep breath.
Blanc has finished reading the report. He refolds it carefully.
MARTA (cont'd)
I -
BLANC
Excuse me. You have not been good to her. You have all treated her like shit to steal back a fortune that you lost and she deserves. You're a pack of bloody vultures at the feast, but you're not getting bailed out, not this time.
(beat)
Ms. Cabrera has decided definitively not to renounce the inheritance.
WALT
What?
MARTA
What?
BLANC
Furthermore it will be my
professional recommendation to the
local authorities that the manner of
death in the case of Harlan Thrombey
is ruled as suicide, and the case is
closed.
What?	RANSOM
MARTA	BLANC
What?  No, Blanc -	Thank you all for coming
goodbye.
He firmly guides Marta out by the elbow.	A beat of silence.
RICHARD
Is anybody else confused?
As the family breaks out in hubub, Linda notices her dad's OLD BASEBALL on the side table where Blanc left it. What's that doing here? She picks it up.
104.
INT. LIBRARY
Blanc steers Marta into the library, as sounds of hubub and shouting come from the other room.
MARTA
What the hell? I want to come clean, this is over -
BLANC
Almost.
Elliott bursts in, motions to the living room, then Marta, then Blanc.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
What - with - what?
BLANC
I'm sorry - officer Wagner!
Wagner enters.
BLANC (cont'd)
Please keep the family out of this room and get them out of the house if you can. But stand by with your additional officer.
TROOPER WAGNER
Get the family out?
BLANC
Yes but not all of them.
Blanc whispers something to Wagner, who nods and exits.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Blanc c'mon, what's all this Drama.
BLANC
Indulge me.
Marta sits.	Elliott remains standing.
MARTA
Blanc. I told Ransom, Ransom told you, I'm telling you now - it is an immovable fact that I killed Harlan.
BLANC
Yes you did, yes he did, yes you are, but. But.
(MORE)
105.
BLANC (cont'd)
I spoke in the car about the hole at the center of this donut. And yes, what you and Harlan did that fateful night seems at first glance to fill that hole perfectly. A donut hole in the donut's hole. But we must look a little closer. And when we do, we see that the donut hole has a hole in its center - it is not a donut hole at all but a smaller donut with its own hole, and our donut is not whole at all!
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Blanc I understand that this is
amusing for you -
BLANC
Why.	Was.	I.	Hired? Why would
someone hire me?
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT Someone fishing for any crime that could help reverse the will.
BLANC
I was hired before the sealed will was read. Yes, the person must have known the contents of the will. But one step further - that same person must have known a crime was committed, and further, if the intent was to reverse Marta's inheritance, they must have known that Marta was responsible.
(beat)
An intriguing combination of factors. Someone who knew what Marta did, wanted to expose it, but could not reveal how they knew.
MARTA
Fran? She was blackmailing me, she knew what I did
BLANC
But Fran wanted money, ergo she did not want the crime exposed.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Did someone in the family see Marta
doing something suspicious?
106.
BLANC
They would have had no reason to not speak up. No. The answer is not so simple.
Blanc sits, suddenly weary.
BLANC (cont'd)
Now with the entire solution in my field of view, the arc of this case is a tragedy of errors. And Marta, it will not be easy to hear. But there is at least one truly guilty party behind it all, guilty in the true sense of acting with malice, and committing a heinous crime with selfish intent.
(calls)
Trooper Wagner.
MARTA
(stunned)
Trooper Wagner??
Blanc squints at her.	No.
A moment later Wagner leads Ransom in. Ransom looks at Marta softly, sadly.
RANSOM
Marta I'm sorry. I told them everything, I figured it was all up. I'm sorry.
MARTA
It's alright Ransom, I'm glad you did.
BLANC
Not exactly everything though.
MARTA
Is this about what Greatnana told you? She saw me that night, she mistook me for Ransom
BLANC
We'll get to that. But first, Mr. Hugh Ransom Drysdale, you might tell us all why you hired me.
RANSOM
Why I hired you?
107.
BLANC
You're right, let's back up. To the night of the party. Your argument with Harlan. What were the overheard words by the Nazi child masturbating in the bathroom - "my will" and "I'm warning you." You and Harlan were "drama mamas," you shared a love of twisting the knife into one another. I don't believe he would have slipped it in halfway - no, I submit that Harlan told you everything.
INT. SMALL STUDY - NIGHT OF PARTY
Ransom and Harlan face each other.
RANSOM
You can't be serious.
HARLAN
Not a red dime or word of my work to a single one of them, you included.
INT. LIBRARY
BLANC
Marta, remind me what Ransom said his conversation with Harlan ended with.
MARTA
Harlan told him that I could beat him in GO.
BLANC
And I asked myself - Marta? Why would the topic of the will have steered around to Marta? There is one obvious explanation... 
INT. SMALL STUDY - NIGHT OF PARTY
RANSOM
You are not this crazy. You would not just throw your fortune away
HARLAN
No. I'm giving it to Marta. All of it.
108.
RANSOM
Ha. To your Brazilian nurse are you goddamn insane.
HARLAN
I'm sane for the first time in my life and I've done it I've made the change to my will it's done
RANSOM
I'm going to stop this Harlan, I -
RANSOM (cont'd)
I'm warning you!
Push into a vent in the wall.
INT. LIBRARY
RANSOM
That is some heavy duty conjecture.
BLANC
Granted. But it's the only way what comes next makes sense. So you storm out, you drive off into the night.
You tell Marta later of what was it, feeling an overwhelming sense of... 
MARTA
Clarity. That he has to make do for himself from here on out.
BLANC
Exactly.
EXT. NORFOLK ROADS - NIGHT OF PARTY
Ransom's Porsche SKIDS TO A STOP on the side of the empty road. Sits idling.
BLANC (V.O.)
Marta. The will. Harlan. "You won't get away with this." Do for yourself. And a plan forms.
A beat. Then the Porsche roars into a skidding U-TURN and drives back the way it came.
109.
EXT. PRIVATE ROAD - NIGHT OF PARTY
Ransom's Porsche kills its lights and drives slowly down the private road, hooking a left at the CARVED ELEPHANT that marks the utility road.
BLANC (V.O.)
You return, careful to avoid the
gate's security camera range.
EXT. WOODS - NIGHT OF PARTY
The Porsche parked, Ransom hacks his way through the woods.
BLANC (V.O.)
Then on foot up towards the house,
EXT. THROMBEY ESTATE SIDE YARD - NIGHT OF PARTY
The party is still going on inside. Ransom slips through the side gate, up towards the house, and up the trellis.
BLANC (V.O.)
You sneak in, up the trellis so as not to be seen by the rest of the family, who are still having their party downstairs.
INT. THIRD FLOOR LANDING - NIGHT OF PARTY
The painting wall swings aside, and Ransom climbs through, leaving mud traces on the sill and the carpet. He heads straight down the narrow hall and into Harlan's bedroom. The party din from downstairs.
BLANC (V.O.)
What you need to do will take moments. But it is essential you are alone, and undetected.
Ransom disappears into the darkened doorway.
BLANC (V.O.) (cont'd) You knew the medications Harlan took. You knew what Marta would be injecting him with that night.
(MORE)
110.
BLANC (V.O.) (cont'd) And you knew if Marta was responsible for his death, even unintentionally, the slayer rule would nullify the changed will, and you would get your share back.
INT. HARLAN'S BEDROOM
Dark and still. Marta's medical bag, open. Ransom has unwrapped two syringes and has the two vials out - the Toradol and the morphine (the "good stuff.")
Using the syringes he extracts the liquid from both vials... 
and then injects the liquids back into the opposite vials.
He SWITCHES THE MEDICATIONS.
BLANC (V.O.)
You use the syringes in the kit to switch the liquids in the two medication vials. And as a final precaution, you take the Naloxone, the life saving antidote.
Replacing the vials he takes an injection pen, closes the bag up and leaves.
INT. LIBRARY
Marta is stunned, she can't even process this.
MARTA
No, no that's impossible.
BLANC
It is the truth. Hand me that vial of morphine, I'll show you.
Blanc has placed two identical vials on the table behind Marta. Her mind is still spinning, she glances at them, takes one and absently hands it to him.
MARTA
If he did that, if the meds were switched, then when I got them mixed up... 
(oh my god)
I accidentally switched them back.
But then I gave Harlan
111.
BLANC
The correct doses. Yes. But not accidentally. I taped over the labels of these two vials.
Blanc shows white tape over the one she just handed him.
Picks up the other vial, shows the same.
BLANC (cont'd)
The vials themselves are identical. How did you know that this was the morphine?
MARTA
I...  just knew
BLANC
You knew because there is the slightest, almost imperceptible difference of tincture and viscosity between the liquids. You knew because you had done it a hundred times. You gave him the correct medication. Because you are a good nurse.
MARTA
Then Harlan was... 
BLANC
I'm sorry Marta. But yes. Harlan was perfectly fine.
He unfolds the tox report and hands it to her.
BLANC (cont'd)
His blood was normal. The cause of death was truly, solely suicide, and you are guilty of nothing but some damage to the trellis and a few amateur theatrics. In fact if he had listened to you, he would be alive today.
Marta is white as a ghost.	She shudders, buckles over.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Hot damn.
BLANC
A twisted web, and we are not finished untangling it. Not yet.
(MORE)
112.
BLANC (cont'd)
Marta when Greatnana spotted you
climbing down the trellis she said
EXT. THROMBEY ESTATE SIDE	YARD - NIGHT OF PARTY
Marta facing Greatnana, who says:
Ransom?  Are	GREATNANA
you back again already?
Are you back	BLANC (V.O.)
again already, because
earlier that	night -
CUT TO: the exact same scene but RANSOM hops down off the trellis, and is startled by Greatnana staring at him.
GREATNANA
Ransom, you're back!
He puts his finger to his lips - shhh, and blows a kiss as he walks off into the night.
INT. LIBRARY
Marta with her fingers on her temples, still unbelieving.
RANSOM
Marta c'mon.
(to Blanc)
This is stoopid with two o's and you don't have a shred of evidence, you're just spinning a fairy tale.
BLANC
Not a shred no, just as we have no real proof of Marta's mixing up the vials so it's your word against -
RANSOM
You have her confession!
The sharpness of this makes Marta look at Ransom for the first time.
BLANC
Ah right, we do have that. If you'll indulge me, I'd like to spin a little further.
113.
EXT. THROMBEY ESTATE SIDE YARD - NIGHT OF PARTY - FLASHBACK
Moonlit, silent.
BLANC (V.O.)
Much later that night you would have to come back to the house, to break back in and retrieve the incriminating tampered vials.
A dark figure, Ransom, approaches the side gate. But when he opens it, the two dogs come bounding across the lawn, barking loudly.
BLANC (V.O.) (cont'd) However, this time the dogs were outside. They barked. Waking Meg.
A light goes on upstairs. The dogs keep barking, paws on the gate. Ransom backs off.
BLANC (V.O.) (cont'd)
No matter.	You'll get the vials
tomorrow.
INT. LIBRARY
BLANC
But tomorrow brings news not of a medical error and guilty nurse, but of a slit throat and suicide!?
INT. RANSOM'S APARTMENT LIVING ROOM - DAY
A nervous Ransom tears a clipping from the local newspaper about Harlan's death, stuffs in it an envelope with a huge fold of cash, and addresses it to Blanc. The New Yorker profile open on the couch.
BLANC (V.O.)	perfect for

BLANC
Enter Benoit Blanc.
114.
Elliott can't help but roll his eyes.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Benny look I hear what you are saying
Trooper Wagner quickly shushs Elliott, enthralled by every word Blanc says.
BLANC
The body was discovered early the next morning. The police, the medical examiners, the family, everyone swarms in,
(to Ransom)
and there is no possible way you can get to Marta's medical bag to remove the vials. You must wait for your moment, when the investigation is over and you know the house will be empty. And that is why you missed the funeral.
INT. THIRD FLOOR LANDING - AFTERNOON - FLASHBACK
Ransom bounds up the stairs, climbs under the POLICE TAPE blocking Harlan's study, and enters.
BLANC (V.O.)
there is no one home to wonder why you're going into Harlan's study. Or so you think.
Fran comes around the corner, spots Ransom and is about to say something, but doesn't.
BLANC (V.O.) (cont'd) Poor Fran. She witnessed you tampering with Harlan's medication in the medical bag. She did not know what you were doing. But she knew you were up to no good. And so her mind begins to turn.
Ransom pockets the two incriminating vials from the medical bag and replaces the Naloxone pen. When he stands to go she retreats.
115.
INT. LIBRARY
MARTA
Oh god that movie she told me about, with Danica McKellar, that's what she was talking about -
TROOPER WAGNER
Deadly by Surprise.
BLANC
She loved Harlan. She hates Ransom. So the poor girl decides to test her theory and make this asshole pay.
She gets a copy of the toxicology report, I will be honest I have no idea how
MARTA
She has a cousin - she told me, she has a cousin who works as a receptionist at the examiners office!
BLANC
Well voila. The numbers mean nothing to her, but if Ransom is guilty its existence is a threat, so she photocopies the header and makes her blackmail note.
MARTA
So why did she send it to me?
BLANC
She did not.	She sent it to Ransom.
INT. RANSOM'S LIVING ROOM - DAY - FLASHBACK
Ransom walks in sorting mail - finds the blank envelope, reads the blackmail note inside, and slowly grins.
BLANC (V.O.)
And when Ransom first gets it, what is his reaction? Elation! He still thinks Marta gave Harlan the tampered drugs! A blood tox report will prove Marta's guilt!
116.
INT. LIBRARY - DAY - FLASHBACK
The will reading, the family assembled. Ransom sits in back, a sly smile on his face as the will is read.
BLANC (V.O.)
He goes to the will reading in high spirits, ready to see the family tear themselves apart, secure in the knowledge that it will all be undone when the tox report comes to light. And then... 
INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
Beers stacked up. Marta has just confessed. Ransom's face is unreadable.
BLANC (V.O.)
Marta's confession. And everything turns on its head. Now he realizes that Marta has committed no crime, and the tox report will prove her innocence. The changed will is going to stand. He has lost. Unless.
INT. LIBRARY
Blanc rounds on Ransom.
BLANC
Unless you decide.

118.
BLANC (V.O.)
and deliver her the blackmail note.
EXT. 1209 COLUMBUS ROAD - MORNING - FLASHBACK
Ransom's Porsche pulls up.	He gets out, pulling on gloves.
BLANC (V.O.)
Step three: keep your appointment with Fran.
INT. 1209 COLUMBUS ROAD - 8AM - FLASHBACK
Fran standing in the middle of the room, nervous. She turns as Ransom walks in and strides towards her.
FRAN
I knew it. I knew you were a no good son of a bitch, I knew Harlan wouldn't have just killed himself.
RANSOM
Yes,	you were right Fran.
Ransom sees the medical bag on the floor, kneels and pulls something out of it.
FRAN
I knew you were guilty as shit. Now you're gonna pay for it don't come near me I'm warning you I -
But he's upon her, hand over her mouth, stifling her scream as he pushes the syringe into her neck and PUSHES THE PLUNGER.
MINUTES LATER - her inert body in the chair. He fishes through her pockets, finds the envelope, and takes the TOX REPORT from it, leaves the empty envelope in her hands.
On his way out: lights the tox report on fire, drops it burning next to Marta's bag. We stay with it as it burns away.
BLANC (V.O.)
Now the board is set. Marta will get the blackmail note. You will put the pieces together for her - the tox report, her one chance at getting away with it all. You'll guide her to the rendezvous.
(MORE)
119.
BLANC (V.O.) (cont'd) You'll make an anonymous call to the police, they will catch her there with the body and the burned evidence. Marta will be arrested for killing Fran...  and Harlan.
INT. LIBRARY
MARTA
She said -
INT. 1209 COLUMBUS ROAD - FLASHBACK
Marta holding Fran on the floor, her dying words -
FRAN
you...  did this... 
INT. LIBRARY
MARTA
She didn't say "you did this," she wasn't talking about me, she said
INT. 1209 COLUMBUS ROAD - FLASHBACK
Exact same moment but this time we hear -
FRAN
Hugh...  did this... 
INT. LIBRARY
MARTA
Hugh did this. Cause you made the help call you Hugh. Cause you're an asshole.
BLANC
(to Ransom)
It would have worked. If we hadn't brought you in for questioning, so you could not make your anonymous call. And if Fran had not stashed a safety copy of the tox report.
120.
INT. 1209 COLUMBUS ROAD - FLASHBACK
Marta turns away from the dying Fran.
BLANC (V.O.)
And if Marta had not outplayed you once again.
Marta turns back, calls 911, gives mouth to mouth to Fran.
BLANC (V.O.) (cont'd) By having a kind heart. By saving Fran's life, though it meant her losing the inheritance and going to jail. She didn't play your game, she saved Fran's life.
INT. LIBRARY
For the first time, Ransom looks afraid.
RANSOM
Fran's alive?
Marta's phone starts to ring. They all see the caller id - it's the hospital.
BLANC
(to Marta)
Oh yes. Fran, who will confirm this fairy story or something close to it.
(to Ransom)
And will send you, Hugh, to jail.
She answers the call, puts the phone to her ear.
MARTA
Yes.
A long beat, then her face breaks in relief.
MARTA (cont'd)
Yes. Thank you doctor, that's great news, we'll be there soon.
She hangs up.	And smiles with radiant joy.
MARTA (cont'd)
She's okay.
(to Blanc)
She's ready to talk.
121.
Ransom stares at Marta, his face a mask.
BLANC
Trooper Wagner, if you would keep Mr. Drysdale in custody while Lieutenant Elliott, Ms. Cabrera and myself go to the hospital to take Fran's statement.
Ransom stands. Steps to Marta, who's frozen, looking in his eyes. His poker face breaks. And he grins.
RANSOM
I want to say this just to you, not to a courtroom of cameras, just to you because you know it's the truth: we allowed you into our home. We allowed you to take care of granddad, to be part of our family and now you think you can steal it from us? You think I'm not going to fight for our birthright, our home, our ancestral family home?
BLANC
Harlan bought this house in the
eighties.	From a Pakistani real
estate baron.
RANSOM
Oh shut up Blanc, shut up! Shut up with that Kentucky fried fog horn rag-horn drawl. Yeah I killed Fran but I guess I didn't, so what do you have on me. Nothing What? attempted murder -
(to Blanc)
I get arson for the bombing, maybe a few other charges, with a good lawyer I'll be out before you know it.
Face to face, Ransom's face hateful, Marta's strong and set.
RANSOM (cont'd)
(to Marta)
And then you'll see just how much hell I can wreak on your life, you vicious little bitch.
But then...  Marta's face starts to do things.	Odd things.
Convulses.	Her jaw clenches.	Her cheeks bulge.
And the PROJECTILE VOMITS into Ransom's face.
122.
RANSOM (cont'd)
AUGH!	WHAT THE SHIT!
He falls back cursing, she drops to her knees, spitting.
Wagner, inappropriately excited:
TROOPER WAGNER
That means she was lying!
MARTA
That's right, Fran's dead.
(to Ransom)
And you just confessed to her murder.
Ransom takes this in.	Then he smirks.
RANSOM
Well.	In for a penny... 
In one fluid motion he spins to the ornamental WALL OF KNIVES, grabs one -
BLANC
No!
and TACKLES MARTA... 
Time slows as Blanc and Elliott lunge to stop him but it's too late -
Ransom and Marta fall together, his arm arcing down
And as the they hit the ground his arm comes down
PLUNGING THE KNIFE UP TO THE HILT IN HER CHEST.
They lie still, breathing hard. Her eyes wide with pain and horror. His cold and wild.
But then she blinks.	Squints.
And he cocks his head.	Realizing something.
Withdraws the knife from her chest.
Its fake blade had retracted into the handle. It's a theatrical prop.
He pumps it up and down a few times, the spring making a pathetic toy noise.
Ransom smirks.
123.
RANSOM
Shit
And is VIOLENTLY TACKLED out of frame by Trooper Wagner.
Leaving Marta lying on her back. Blanc shouting if she's alright, Elliott and Wagner wrestling Ransom into cuffs, it all fades into the background as she holds the knife and stares at the ceiling.
INT. SMALL STUDY
CLOSE ON: Harlan's old baseball being set carefully back in place.
By Linda. She's about to leave, but she notices the pink envelope on the desk. Picks it up, takes out the blank note. Seems to recognize it, and smiles sadly.
EXT. THROMBEY ESTATE FRONT DRIVE - LATER
Linda comes outside and joins the family.
Several more police cars, and an ambulance. Ransom is loaded into the cop car. His family are held at bay by officers, but they react in different ways -
Richard yelling at the cops. Walt sobbing, Donna collapsed against him, Jacob on his phone.
Joni staring into space, ruined. Meg talking to Lieutenant Elliott, crying. She's just learned about Fran.
Linda watches the circus, strangely disconnected, going to light a cigarette. With a strange smirk, she uses the flame to warm the blank note from the office, and HIDDEN WRITING starts to appear - a note from her father. Their secret communication. As the letters appear, her face changes.
INT. LIVING ROOM
Marta sits, a blanket over her shoulders. An officer who's just taken her statement walks away. Blanc approaches.
MARTA
Can I ask. At what point did you suspect I had something to do with Harlan's death?
124.
BLANC
From the moment you first set foot in front of me.
Taps her shoe.	The tiny, faded spot of blood.
MARTA
Oh my god.
BLANC
I want you to remember something very important: you won not by playing the game Harlan's way, but yours.
Through the window she sees the family outside.
MARTA
I should help them.	Right?
BLANC
I have my own opinion. But I have a feeling you'll follow your heart.
He gives her a wink, and strolls off.
INT. FOYER - LATER
Marta shuffles to the front doorway. One last glance at Harlan's portrait, its grin now gentle and content.
EXT. FRONT PORCH / BALCONY
She stands on the threshold. Sees Blanc get into the front door of a cruiser, and it drives off - Ransom in the back. He looks back at her through the window.
The family out on the lawn. Not sure where to go or what to do. They all turn to see: Marta standing very small, but somehow not, in the doorway of her house.
