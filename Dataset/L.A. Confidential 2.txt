CHASE
Jack, I'll see you Monday on set.

JACK
I won't be there.	They're toning
down my profile.


PRINTING PRESS

The latest issue of Hush-Hush flies through. On the cover: "Gail Russell Caught In Love Nest. Nymph or No?"


INT. CITY JAIL - DAY

Bud White flips through today's booking slips, finds one that's interesting. Reading to himself...

BUD
Domestic.	Assault and battery.

Containment Squad strong-arms, BREUNING and CARLISLE
 
pause as they pass.

CARLISLE
Ready to go, Bud?

BUD
I'll be there in five minutes.


CITY JAIL - HALLWAY

Bud walks to a door covered in sheet metal. He opens it to reveal a holding tank with a burly, jumpsuited PRISONER.

BUD
I hear you like to hit women.

PRISONER

My wife.	She's dropping charges
so it's none of your business.

Bud enters, closes the door behind him. A beat, we hear the sounds of FISTS ON FLESH. It's Bud's business now.


INT. BEVERLY HILLS MANSION - STUDY - NIGHT

Deuce Perkins (the Mickey Cohen narcotics lieutenant seen earlier) stands at the bookshelf. He pulls down books to reveal a shoe box. He sets it on his desk, pulls back the cover to reveal several bags of white powder. Heroin.

A BRANCH SNAPS outside. Perkins opens a drawer, fishes a revolver. Turning off the light, he heads to the window. His finger parts the curtains. At that instant, he staggers, falls as GUNFIRE rips into him.

The heroin just sits there on the desk.


EXT. McNEIL PENITENTIARY - DAY

Grim-faced guards scan the yard from machine-gunned towers.


INT. McNEIL PENITENTIARY - VISITOR BOOTH - DAY

Mickey Cohen sits across from visitor Johnny Stompanato.
Cohen is going off the handle.

COHEN

What do you mean Deuce Perkins got
clipped last night?!

STOMPANATO
They shot him in his library.

COHEN
 
I don't want a floor plan; I want
to know who!	Who's taking the
ticket for this, Johnny?

STOMPANATO
Nobody.	At least not yet.

COHEN
And what about the merchandise
Deuce was holding for me?

STOMPANATO

Gone.	Not a trace.

COHEN
Some ferstunkener is moving in and
we don't know who?!	Maybe we

should ask Hedda Hopper!

As "STRANGER IN PARADISE" ENDS, so does the MONTAGE.


INT. BRIEFING ROOM - AD VICE - DAY

Addressing the squad, a no-nonsense VICE CAPTAIN picks up a stack of magazines.

VICE CAPTAIN
Picture-book smut, gentlemen.
There's been a bunch of it found
at collateral crime scenes lately.
Mostly narcotics and prostitution

collars.

As the Vice Capt. hands it out for the men to examine, new member Jack Vincennes arrives late.

VICE CAPTAIN
Look who's back from suspension.
We're honored, Sergeant Jack.

The men laugh. Jack sits, flips a magazine. Men and women. Men and men. Girls and girls. Girls and horses.

JACK
Gee.	The Great Jerk-Off Book
Caper of 1953.

VICE CAPTAIN

Vincennes, is there someplace
you'd rather be?

JACK
Yeah, Cap.	Back in Narcotics.

VICE CAPTAIN
Oh?	Anyplace else?

JACK

Working whores with squad two.
 
VICE CAPTAIN
Maybe you should have thought of
that before you made Bloody
Christmas page one.

Vice Capt. retrieves the magazines, hands them to Jack.

VICE CAPTAIN
They're yours.	Make a major case,
Sergeant.	It's the only way
you're getting out of here.

Exaggerated "oohs" and "aahs" from the men.

VICE CAPTAIN
Dismissed, gentlemen.

As they go, Jack sees the books are stamped: "Fleur-de-Lis Whatever you desire." Jack takes the matching

business card from his wallet, the one he found on Christmas Eve.

VICE CAPTAIN
Roll, Vincennes.	No sidetracks.
This is Ad Vice, not Narco.


INT. HOLLYWOOD STATION - NARCO PEN - DAY

Jack Vincennes is at his desk. Holding the Fleur-de-Lis card, magazines spread before him, Jack dials the number.


INT. HUSH-HUSH MAGAZINE OFFICE - DAY

Sid Hudgeons sits behind his desk, answers the phone.

HUDGEONS
Hush-Hush.	Off the record and on
the Q.T.

JACK (V.O.)

Sid, it's Vincennes.

HUDGEONS
Jackie, are you back on Narco?	I
need copy.

INTERCUT WITH Jack at his desk:

JACK
No.	But I've got something going
with Ad Vice.

HUDGEONS
Something good?

JACK
Don't know.	I'm chasing picture
books.	Fuck shots, but the posers
don't look like junkies.	It's
 
well done stuff.	I thought you
might have heard something.

Hudgeons reaches into a stack of papers, pulls out a magazine like the one Jack has.

HUDGEONS

Not a word.

JACK
What about Fleur-de-Lis?	Their
slogan's 'Whatever you desire.'

HUDGEONS

No.	No, I've heard bupkis.	Jack,
I'll talk to you later.	Call me
when you get something I can use.

Smut's from hunger.	For sad sacks
who can't get their ashes hauled

The LINE CLICKS off. Jack hesitates a moment before cradling the receiver. Something's not right here.


EXT. HOLYWOOD STATION - PARKING LOT - TWILIGHT

As Exley pulls in, his two-way drones:

DISPATCHER (V.O.)

Park Rangers report three Negro
youths discharging shotguns into
the air in Griffith Park.

Suspects are driving a late model
purple Mercury Coupe.

As the report ends, Exley switches off the two-way and gets out of his car.


INT. HOLLYWOOD STATION - SQUAD ROOM - NIGHT

Accompanied by Bud, Dick Stensland crams the contents of his desk into a box. Well-wishing cops pat him on the back, offer words of encouragement, but Stensland looks like he's going to cry.

It's very bad timing as Exley enters, comes face-to-face with them. This is hatred.

Acting on impulse, Bud goes after Exley. It's a mauling. Four vicious body shots. A potentially lethal head shot sails wide as Exley falls to the ground.

As four men move to hold Bud back, Exley looks up at him.

EXLEY
(gasping)

You're just a thug, White.	That's
all you'll ever be.

Dudley steps into the fray.	He helps Exley to his feet.
 
DUDLEY

You should stay away from a man
when his blood is up.

EXLEY
His blood's always up.

Four cops are genuinely having trouble holding Bud back.

Dudley watches with something bordering on admiration.

DUDLEY

Then maybe you should stay away
from him all the time.


EXT. HOLLYWOOD STATION - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Accompanied by Bud, Stensland reaches his car, loads his box of stuff into the trunk. Bud is moody, pensive.

STENSLAND

Don't look so down in the mouth,
Bud.	You nailed him good.

BUD
Yeah, sure... I got a couple of
hours before I have to be at the
Victory.	Want to grab a beer?

STENSLAND
Rain check me, partner.	I got
something big going on tonight.

BUD
What?	That new mystery girl
you've been seeing?

STENSLAND

No.	I'll tell you sometime.	Not
now.	Don't want to jinx it.	But
it could take the edge off that

jail time I got coming.

BUD
What are you talking about?

STENSLAND
It's confidential, Bud.	Like that

magazines Vincennes scams for.
Hush-Hush.
(smiles)

I'll see you tomorrow.	And hey,
if it works out, you'll get a
piece of it.

Stensland gets in the car, drives off. Bud is left alone.


INT. HOLLYWOOD STATION - SQUAD ROOM - NIGHT
 
Exley sits alone in a sea of desks. The SQUAWK BOX DRONES. Exley squints at the clock on the wall, can't make it out. He takes his glasses from the inside of his jacket. 2:00 A.M. Finally, something to do. He walks to the wall calendar, tears off Feb. 28 to reveal Mar. 1.

As Exley sits, the call SQUAWK BOX booms to life.

VOICE
Squad call!	Nite Owl Coffee Shop
One-eight-one-two-four Cherokee!

Multiple homicides!	Multiple
homicides!	Code three!


EXT. HOLLYWOOD AND CHEROKEE - NIGHT

Patrol cars. Blues setting up a crime scene blockade. Exley pulls up, DOUSES his SIREN. PATROLMAN #1 runs over.

PATROLMAN #1
Loads of people down.	Men.
Women.	I stopped for coffee --

Exley pushes him aside, heads for the door. It's wide open.


INT. NITE OWL - NIGHT

Exley takes mental snapshots. Ten stools front a counter. The side wall mural-papered: winking owls perched on street signs. On the right a string of tables. Three in disarray. Food spilled, dishes broken. A high-heel pump by an upended chair.

Heel drag marks across the linoleum floor heading back toward the kitchen. Exley follows. Past an open, empty cash register. Outside -- SIRENS.


SERVICE RUNWAY

Crisscrossed drag marks connect, lead to a walk-in...


FOOD LOCKER

Blood-soaked bodies on the floor. Five, maybe six in a tangle. Dozens of shotgun shells float in the pools of blood. As Exley struggles to maintain his composure...

ROOKIE (O.S.)
Holy shit fuck...

Exley looks at a green-faced ROOKIE in the locker doorway.

ROOKIE
 
S-s-sir, there's a captain outside
wants to see you.

EXLEY

Don't get sick!	Not in here!

Exley shoves the Rookie, puking, out the door.


EXT. NITE OWL - NIGHT

Patrolmen hold back a swarm of reporters and rubber-neckers. HORNS BLAST. Motorcycles run interference for meat wagons cut off by the crown. As Ed emerges, reporters surge, shout questions. Exley hurries past, finds Dudley in command and barking orders.

EXLEY
Sir, I took the call.	It's my

case.

DUDLEY

Edmund, you don't want it and you
can't have it.

EXLEY
Yes, I do, sir.

DUDLEY

It's mine.	I'll make you my
second in command.

Exley spots a photographer moving in. He looks properly serious as the flash bulb pops.


INT. NIGHT OWL - NIGHT

Forensics Chief RAY PINKER walks Exley and Dudley through.

PINKER

We got a total of forty-five spent
12-gauge Remington shotgun shells.
Three men with five-shot-capacity
pumps.	All of them reloading
twice.

EXLEY

Hold on... We need to canvass.
See if a purple Mercury was seen
around here tonight.

DUDLEY

Why?

EXLEY

We got a call earlier on three
Negro youths.	Firing shotguns in
Griffith Park from a late-model
purple Mercury Coupe.
 
DUDLEY

(to his adjutant)
Get on it.

A FORENSICS COP approaches Pinker.

FORENSICS COP
We got an I.D. on one of the
victims, sir... I think it's Dick
Stensland.

Exley and Dudley react, look at each other.


EXT. VICTORY MOTEL - DAWN

Set in a no-man's-land of bulldozed homes. A sign proudly announces the impending arrival of the freeway. The motel is surrounded by a barbed-wire fence. Abandoned but for a pair of LAPD cars and a light burning in room 6.

An unmarked pulls up and Exley and Dudley step out. They start forward, but a SCREAM inside 6 stops Exley short.

DUDLEY

With Mickey Cohen in prison, Los
Angeles is organized crime free.
The Chief wants it to stay that
way, Edmund.	The means are not
for the weak-hearted.


INT. VICTORY MOTEL - ROOM 6 - DAWN

Bare. A table and chair bolted to the floor. A tough FLAT-NOSED GANGSTER is cuffed to the hot seat. On the table are a .45 and a fat roll of $100 bills.

Breuning and Carlisle watch as Bud White delivers a couple of short, stiff body shots. Flatnose is not used to being on the receiving end. All the same, we get the idea Bud's a bit reluctant.

Bud's back is to Dudley and Exley who enter behind him.

DUDLEY
Come, Wendell, you can do better

than that.

Bud turns, sees Exley and Dudley. A beat. As Bud looms over Flatnose, the gangster babbles. Snitch-frenzied.

FLATNOSE
I know things.	I hear things.
Like with the Mick inside, things

are on this weird slowdown.
(MORE)

FLATNOSE (CONT'D)
 
These shooter teams, bang bang
bang, they're 86-ing Mickey
Cohen's men.

DUDLEY
We know all that, lad.	Tell us,
who do these shooters work for?

FLATNOSE

I don't know.	No one knows.
Maybe they're mavericks.	You want
a prostie roust?	Huh?	Some narco

action?
(breaking down)
What do you want?!

DUDLEY

We want you to go home.
(to Breuning)

Uncuff him, Michael.

Dudley turns to Exley.

DUDLEY

Mr. Sifakis is a known loan shark
from San Francisco.	He arrived
this afternoon at Union Station.

Looking for business opportunities
in our fair city.	An organized
crime associate in need of re-
education in the ways of polite
society.

Uncuffed, Flatnose rubs his wrists. Wary. As Breuning steps back, Flatnose snatches the .45 off the table.

FLATNOSE

Motherfuckers!

Exley dives for cover, but the other four cops just stand there. Dudley looks down on the floor at Exley.

DUDLEY
It's part of the play, Edmund.	A
sincerity test.

Flatnose looks at the gun a beat, then squeezes the TRIGGER. CLICK CLICK. No bullets.

DUDLEY
(to Breuning)
Sit him back down.

CLICK, CLICK.	They shove Flatnose back in the hot seat.

Dudley offers a hand to Exley, helps him to his feet.

DUDLEY

Wendell, you need to accompany
Detective Lieutenant Exley on
official police business.	I'll
finish up here.
 

INT. EXLEY'S PLYMOUTH - DAY

They drive in silence.	No love lost here.	Finally.

BUD

Where are we going?

EXLEY
It's a surprise.	You like
surprises, don't you, White?


EXT. COUNTY MORGUE - DAY

Exley pulls up.	Bud looks to him.	Really curious now.


INT. COUNTY MORGUE - HALLWAY - DAY

Exley and Bud walk. An orderly wheels a covered corpse toward them from the other end of the hall. Bud's spooked. The orderly wheels the body in to the examination room.

As Bud and Exley pass, the CORONER pulls back the sheet, is surprised at the sight of a woman who we don't quite see.

CORONER
Call me crazy, but for a second I
thought it was Rita Hayworth.


MORGUE MEAT LOCKER

Exley and Bud walk past a wall of drawers to where a coroner's assistant waits.

EXLEY
We need you to I.D. the body.
There's no next of kin and you
knew him best.	So tell me...

The assistant pulls open drawer 12.	A naked man.

A tag on his toe and half his face blown off.

EXLEY
Is that Dick Stensland?

Stunned, Bud stares at what's left of his old partner.

BUD
Yeah, that's Stens.

EXLEY
Hell of a way to avoid a prison
sentence.
 
Bud's torn between wanting to smash Exley and finding out why Stensland is dead. He squeezes out the words.

BUD

What happened?

EXLEY

Someone held up a coffee shop,
panicked and killed six people.

Then, from the hall...

WOMAN (O.S.)
Not my baby!	Not my little girl!


INT. COUNTY MORGUE - EXAMINATION ROOM - DAY

HILDA LEFFERTS, 50, enters with the coroner to ID the body of her daughter, Susan.

There's stray buckshot in the upper chest and shoulders, but a sheet hides the real damage. It's the girl Bud saw outside Hollywood Liquor. Without the black eyes, she does look like Rita hayworth.

As Bud and Exley appear, Mrs. Lefferts looks confused.

CORONER

Is this your daughter, Mrs.
Lefferts?

MRS. LEFFERTS
I -- I don't know.

EXLEY
We know this is difficult.	Just
take your time and look again.

Exley doesn't realize, but Bud recognizes the deceased.

MRS. LEFFERTS

It seems like my Susan, but...

EXLEY
When was the last time you saw
her, Mrs. Lefferts?

MRS. LEFFERTS

At Christmas.	We had fought.	I
didn't like her boyfriend.	I --
she has a birthmark on her hip.

The Coroner lifts the sheet.	Mrs. Lefferts gasps.

MRS. LEFFERTS
It's her.	My baby.	Dear God...

As Mrs. Lefferts swoons, Bud and Exley both hold her up.
 
INT. LAPD HEADQUARTERS - BRIEFING ROOM - DAY

The room buzzes, jammed to the rafters with every detective standing ready. The Chief waits as Dudley Smith takes the mike, holds up an L.A. Times headline.

DUDLEY

'Nite Owl Massacre.'	Hyperbole
aside, this is a heinous crime
that requires a swift resolution.
The public will demand it and this
department will provide it.	Six

victims.	One of them, one of our
own -- Dick Stensland.
(as the cops react)
As it happens, he was a Nite Owl
regular.	In the wrong place at

the wrong time.

Bud White listens, not too sure. Stensland said he had something big going on...

DUDLEY
Robbery looks like the motive.	We
have rubber glove prints on the
register and preliminary forensics
strongly lean toward a trio of

gunmen.	We do have one hot lead,
so listen well.	Three Negro
youths were seen last night
discharging shotguns in the air at
Griffith Park.

A park ranger I.D.ed them as
driving a 1948 to 1950 Mercury

Coupe, purple in color.	An hour
ago, a canvassing crew found a
news vendor who saw a purple Merc

Coupe parked across from the Nite
Owl around 3:00 A.M.

The room goes loud, a big rumbling. Dudley holds up a list.

DUDLEY

The D.M.V. worked all night to get
us a registration list on '48 to
'50 purple Mercs.	There are 142

registered to Negroes in L.A.
County.	Fifty two-man teams will

shake three names apiece.	Hot
suspects you'll bring here.
Interrogation rooms have been set

up.	They'll be run by Lieutenant
Edmund Exley.	Hollywood Squad.

Catcalls.	Boos.	The Chief steps to the mike.

CHIEF
Enough on that.	Gentlemen, just
go out and get them.	Use all
necessary force.	The people of
 
Los Angeles demand it.

The men exchange knowing looks. The real message: kill them clean. Exley doesn't approve. As the men hurry out...

EXLEY

He might as well have put a bounty
on them.


INT. SQUAD ROOM - DAY

Detectives pairing up and moving out. Scanning his three name list, Bud joins his PARTNER for the day.

BUD

Can you take them?	I got
I got something I gotta do.

PARTNER
Christ, I don't know.	What if one
of these names...

BUD
What I gotta do is for Stensland.
My partner.

The guy looks at him a beat, nods.	As Bud heads off...


EXLEY

watches everyone go. Wishes he could be part of the action. He spots Jack talking to his REDNECK partner for for the day.


JACK AND REDNECK

Redneck chews tobacco, has a Texas drawl.

REDNECK
Where to, Trash?

JACK
If we go by the list, we have
about zero chance of making the
collar.	But I know a guy who

knows what's going on south of
Jefferson.	I'm betting he could
put us at 50/50.

REDNECK

I don't know...

As Redneck thinks, Exley steps up.	He's overheard.

EXLEY

I'll take those odds.
(to Redneck)
 
Take off.	We got it from here.

Jack stares. Redneck shrugs, spits tobacco juice in a cup.

REDNECK
Between the two of you guys, you
should bring along a photographer.


INT. HOLLYWOOD LIQUOR - DAY

Last time we saw the Owner was Christmas Eve. He looks up from a customer as Bud strides in, badge out front.

BUD
I need an address on a customer of
yours.	Her name was Lynn.

OWNER
That's all I have to go on?

BUD
Yeah.	And I think you already
know who I mean, so cough it up.

OWNER

Lynn Bracken.	There's a billing
address and a delivery address.

BUD
Give me both.	Billing first.


EXT. 1184 GRETNA GREEN, BRENTWOOD (PATCHETT'S) - DAY

A big, pink Spanish mansion with lots of tile. Also last seen outside Hollywood Liquor on Christmas Eve, Pierce Patchett is in the front yard, chipping golf balls over a koi pond. They land in a tight grouping. As he tees up:

BUD (O.S.)

You must slay 'em at the country
club.

Bud's halfway up the walk. Patchett sees the cuffs hooked to his belt. Patchett is cool as can be.

BUD

Are you Pierce Patchett?

PATCHETT

I am.	Are you soliciting for
police charities?	The last time,
you people called at my office.

BUD

I'm a homicide detective.	Where
were you last night?

PATCHETT
 
I was here, hosting a party.	Who
was killed and why do you think I
can help?

BUD
Richard Stensland.

PATCHETT
I don't know him.	Mr...

BUD
Officer White.	How about Susan
Lefferts?	You know her?

PATCHETT
(sighs, concedes)
You know I do or you wouldn't be

here.	How did you find me?

BUD
We met outside Hollywood Liquors
on Christmas Eve.	This is where

Lynn Bracken's booze bills go.

PATCHETT
Of course...

BUD
Sue Lefferts died at the Nite Owl.
I'm investigating.

Patchett studies Bud a beat, weighing his options.

Patchett's burly BODYGUARD starts over from the house.

BODYGUARD
Everything alright, Mr. Patchett?

PATCHETT
(waves him off)
Fine, Philip.	Thank you.

BUD

Where's the other guy?	Buzz.

PATCHETT
He no longer works for me.
(a beat)

Find Susan's killer, Mr. White.
I'll give you a handsome reward.

Whatever you desire.

If only Jack had been around to hear that.

BUD

Thanks, but no thanks.

PATCHETT

Against your code?

BUD
I don't have one.	Lefferts looked
 
beat-up Christmas Eve, but didn't
act it.	How come?

PATCHETT

Do you care about criminal matters
peripheral to Susan's murder?

BUD
No.

PATCHETT
Then you wouldn't feel obligated
to report them?

BUD
That's right.

PATCHETT
Then listen closely, because I'll

only say this once and if it gets
repeated, I'll deny it.	I run
call girls.	Lynn Bracken is one

of them and so was Susan Lefferts.
I treat my girls very well.	I
have grown daughters, myself, and
I don't like the thought of women
being hurt.	I sense you share

this feeling.

BUD
(ignores comment)
Why were Lefferts' eyes black?

PATCHETT

I think she'd been hit in the face
with a tennis racket.	She is --
was -- a big doubles fan.

BUD

You wanna go downtown and discuss
this officially?

PATCHETT
Wait.	Our deal still holds?

Bud nods, his patience running thin.

PATCHETT
I needed a Rita Hayworth to fill

out my little studio.

BUD

What little studio?

PATCHETT
There's Gardner, Hepburn, Grable,
Turner.	Lynn Bracken is my

Veronica Lake.	I use girls who
look like movie stars.	Sometimes
I employ a plastic surgeon.
 
BUD
That's why her mother couldn't
I.D. her... Jesus fucking Christ.

PATCHETT
No, Mr. White.	Pierce Morehouse
Patchett.	Now, I sense you're on

your best behavior, but that's all
I'll give you.	If you persist,
I'll meet you with my attorney.
Now, would you like Miss Bracken's
address?	I doubt she knows

anything, but --

BUD
I got her address.

PATCHETT
Of course... this is personal with

you, isn't it, Mr. White?

Bud turns, heads down the walk. Patchett hits his golf ball. It lands just past the koi pond, with the rest. Ice.


EXT. 1736 NOTTINGHAM, LOS FELIZ (LYNN BRACKEN'S) - DAY

A modern-looking triplex. A projector's flicker strobes against the closed curtains. We hear a PHONE RING.


INT. 1736 NOTTINGHAM (LYNN BRACKEN'S) - DAY

The film is This Gun For Hire with Alan Ladd and Veronica Lake. It's projected on a wall in front of which stands Lynn Bracken and an OLDER GENTLEMAN, in his underwear. Lynn's long, blonde hair hangs down over one eye. She looks more like Veronica Lake than Veronica Lake. The film flashes over them as they kiss.

The PHONE RINGS. Lynn ignores it as long as she can before breaking away to go answer it.

LYNN
Hello?

OLDER GENTLEMAN
(Alan Ladd)

Is it the cops?

She waves him off. As he practices pointing his finger like Ladd points a gun, Lynn reacts to the news on the phone.


EXT. 9781 SOUTH DUQUESNE - DAY

A South Central plywood and tar-paper dive. A BLACK BOXER pounds a heavy bag/speed bag combo bolted to the porch. Wiry, a welterweight, he doesn't see Jack and
 
Exley till they're almost on top of him.

JACK
Leonard Bidwell?

The Boxer leans on the bag to catch his breath. Looking them over, he finally nods.

JACK

How's the left these days?

BOXER

What's it to you?

JACK
I saw you fight Kid Gavilan.	I
like your style.

BOXER

What do you want, Mr. Policeman?

JACK

You got a brother up in Folsom.	I
know because I put him there.

BOXER
Till 19-fucking-70.

JACK

How'd you like to make it 1960?	I
know the judge and Sergeant Exley
here is friends with hte D.A.

Exley nods, this is true.	The Boxer's still listening.

JACK
We're looking for three colored
guys who like to pop off shotguns.
One of 'em owns a purple Merc
coupe.

BOXER

You wanna get me a fuckin' snitch
jacket?

JACK
You wanna buy your brother ten
years...?	You don't have to say
anything.	Just look at this list

and point.	Here.

Jack holds the DMV list out to the Boxer, who waves it off.

BOXER
He's bad, so I'll just tell you.
Sugar Ray Coates.	Drives a '49

coupe, a beautiful ride.	Don't
know about shotguns, but he gets
his thrills killing dogs.	He is
righteous trash.
 
Jack and Exley scan the list. Jack's finger stabs down on, "Coates, Raymond, 9611 South Central, Room 414."

JACK
That's five minutes from here.


EXT. 1736 NOTTINGHAM (LYNN BRACKEN'S) - DAY

Lynn does her best to usher the slightly disheveled Older Gentleman out the door.

OLDER GENTLEMAN

I don't understand, doll, we just
got started.

LYNN
I'm sorry, but I'll make it up

to you.	I promise.

OLDER GENTLEMAN

Gosh, kitten, I don't know...

As he begins to mash up against her...

BUD (O.S.)

Hit the road, gramps.

Bud's standing at the bottom of the stairs. The Older Gentleman strikes a pose. He still thinks he's Alan Ladd.

OLDER GENTLEMAN

Alright.	This time I'll go, but
next time --

BUD
(flips badge)
L.A.P.D., shitbird.	Get the fuck
out of here or I'll call your wife
to come get you.

Sputtering, the Older Gentleman exchanges a look with Lynn then hurries away, giving Bud a wide berth.

LYNN

I've been expecting you.	Pierce
called.	Told me what happened

to Sue.


INT. 1736 NOTTINGHAM (LYNN BRACKEN'S) - DAY

A nice breezy feel.	The perfect place to shack up.

LYNN

It's Officer White, isn't it?

Bud nods, eyeballs the place.
 
LYNN
Can I get you a drink?

BUD

Yeah, plain scotch.

Bud watches her move to the bar.	God, she's beautiful.

LYNN

I was friendly with Sue Lefferts,
but we weren't really friends.
You know what I mean?

BUD

Are you sorry she's dead?

LYNN

Of course I am.	What kind of
question is that?

She steps back with a scotch for both of them.

BUD
Have you ever heard of Dick
Stensland?

LYNN

No I haven't.	Do you know why
Pierce is humoring you?

BUD
You use words like that, you
might make me mad.

LYNN
Yes.	But do you know?

BUD
Yeah I know.	Patchett's running
whores and judging by his address,
probably something bigger on the
side.	He doesn't want any

attention.

LYNN
That's right.	Our motives are
selfish, so we're cooperating.

BUD

Why was Susan Lefferts at the
Nite Owl?

LYNN
I don't know.	I never heard of
the Nite Owl till today.

BUD

Did Lefferts have a boyfriend?

LYNN
Like I said we were friendly,
 
not friends.

BUD
How'd she meet Patchett?

LYNN
Pierce meets people.	Sue came
on the bus with dreams of
Hollywood.	This is how they
turned out.	Thanks to Pierce,
we still get to act a little.

BUD
Tell me about Patchett.

LYNN
He's waiting for you to mention
mention.

BUD
You want some advice, Miss
Bracken?

LYNN

It's Lynn.

BUD

Miss Bracken, don't ever try to
fucking bribe me or threaten me
or I'll have you and Patchett
in shit up to your ears.

Lynn smiles again.	She likes Bud.	A beat.

LYNN
I remember you from Christmas
Eve.	You have a thing for

helping women, don't you,
Officer White?

BUD
Maybe I'm just fucking curious.

LYNN

You say 'fuck' a lot.

BUD

You fuck for money.

LYNN
There's blood on your shirt.	Is

that an integral part of your job?

BUD

Yeah.

LYNN

Do you enjoy it?

BUD
When they deserve it.
 
LYNN

Did they deserve it today?

BUD
I'm not sure.

LYNN
But you did it anyway.

BUD
Yeah, just like the half dozen
guys you screwed today.

LYNN
(laughs again)
Actually, it was two.	You're

different, Officer White.	You're
the first man in five years who

didn't tell me I look like
Veronica Lake inside of a minute.

BUD
You look better than Veronica
Lake.	Now, Pierce Patchett.

LYNN

He takes a cut of our earnings
and invests it for us.	He makes
us quit the life at thirty.	He
doesn't let us use narcotics and
he doesn't abuse us.	Can your

policeman's mentality grasp
those contradictions?

BUD
He had you cut to look like
Veronica Lake?

LYNN
No.	I'm really a brunette, but
the rest is me.	And that's all

the news that's fit to print.

Lynn starts toward the door. Bud watches her a moment, then follows. She takes his glass at the door.

LYNN
It was nice meeting you, Officer.

Out the door, Bud turns back.	Blurts:

BUD
Look.	I want to see you again.

LYNN
Are you asking me for a date or

an appointment?

BUD
(suddenly unsure)
 
I don't know.

LYNN
(another smile)

If it's a date I think you'd
better tell me your first name
because I --

BUD

(feeling foolish)
Forget I asked.	It was a
mistake.

Lynn watches thoughtfully after Bud as he walks away.

He opens his car door like he's going to tear ir off.
A last glance back at Lynn and as he gets in the car...


EXT. TEVERE HOTEL - DAY

An L-shaped walk-up. Jack coasts the car to the curb. He leaps out with Exley. Exley holds up at the sight of a late model sedan. He leans down to look in the window at the two-way on the dash.

EXLEY
L.A.P.D.

JACK

Shit.	Someone beat us here.

VOICES from the carport ahead. We see a chrome bumper, the purple fender of a '49 Mercury coupe. A door slams. Drawing a .45, Jack starts over with Exley, .38 in hand.


CARPORT

Toting shotguns, Dudley's boys from the Victory Motel, Breuning and Carlisle, stand by the purple Mercury. Jack and Exley come around the corner, lower their guns.

JACK
Hey.

Breuning wheels, pumps a round into the chamber. He very nearly fires before he sees who it is.

CARLISLE

What the fuck are you guys doing
here?

EXLEY
Think of us as back-up.

JACK
What do you got?

As Jack moves to peer through the Merc's window.

BREUNING
 
Three Ithaca pumps, an empty box
of double-ought buck and cash.

Jack spots them. Three shotguns on the passenger side floor, an empty box of shells and loose dollar bills.

JACK

So long, Vice.	Badge of Honor,
here I come.

CARLISLE
Fuck you, Vincennes.	It's our
collar.

Breuning actually has to restrain his partner.

EXLEY

Quiet.	I'm ranking officer here.
We go as a team.	End of story.


INT. CORRIDOR - TEVERE HOTEL - DAY

Breuning and Carlisle lead the way with Jack and Exley bringing up the rear. Squinting, Exley reaches to his pocket for something. Not there.

EXLEY
Damnit...

JACK
What?

EXLEY

Glasses.

JACK

(chuckling)
Just don't shoot me.

The door to 414. Two men on either side. Breuning rears back. Jack rears back. They kick at the same instant. The door flies off its hinges to reveal two young black men, LARRY FONTAINE and TY JONES, waking from a couple of flop mattresses.


ROOM 414

Fontaine jumps up. Entering, Carlisle aims, but Exley grabs his arm. The BLAST rips the ceiling. Jack aims.

JACK
Freeze!

Fontaine freezes.	Jones doesn't dare get up.

CARLISLE
Ace him, Jack.

EXLEY
 
Shut up, Carlisle!

Jack and Exley burst into a...


SECOND BEDROOM

Another black, RAY COATES, passed out on mattress, sur-rounded by empty beer cans. Jack sticks his .38 in his back, starts to cuff him. As the cuff ratchets down...


INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY

Dudley watches intently as Ed Exley skims a report, memorizing names and dates. Jack and other brass are also here along with a stenographer. So's Bud. One of these guys killed Stensland. Through tinted glass, the three suspects in three different rooms.

EXLEY
Casitas Youth Camp... Coates
twenty-two, a boxer... Manager
saw them burning clothes.

Satisfied, Exley sets the report down.

DUDLEY
Ed, I want confessions.

EXLEY
I'll break them, sir.

As Exley steps into the #1 room, Jack joins Dudley.

JACK
You think golden boy can handle
it, Cap?

DUDLEY
I think you'll be surprised what
Edmund's capable of.


INT. #1 ROOM - DAY

Exley closes the door. Ray Coates is cuffed to a chair, dressed in baggy County denims. One eye swollen shut, lip split, a smashed nose with one nostril split.

Exley unlocks his cuffs. drops cigarettes and amtches on the table. As Coates rubs his wrists...

EXLEY

They call you Sugar Ray because
of Ray Robinson?
(no answer)

They say Robinson can throw a
four punch combination in one
second.	Do you believe that?
 
Coates just stares at him.

EXLEY
You're twenty-two, aren't you, Ray?

COATES
Say what and so what.

EXLEY

Did one of the officers work you
over a little?

No bite.	Coates just stares back.

EXLEY
You look like Robinson after
that last LaMotta fight.	'Course

LaMotta looked a lot worse.	So
you're twenty-two, right?

COATES
Man, why do you keep asking me
that?

EXLEY
Just getting my facts straight.
Twenty-two makes it a gas chamber

bounce.
You should have pulled this caper
a couple of years ago.	Get life,
do a little Youth Authority jolt,
transfer to Folsom a big man.

Orbit on some of that good prison
brew, get yourself a sissy --

COATES
I never truck with no sissies!

EXLEY

That fucking Larry.	I almost
believed him.

COATES
Believed what?

EXLEY
Nothing, Ray.
(laughs)
That Larry, he's a pisser.	You

did the Casitas Youth Camp with
him, didn't you?

COATES
Man, why're you talkin' about
Larry?	His business is his
business.

Unseen by Coates, Exley reaches under the table, takes hold of one of three toggle switches.

EXLEY
 
Sugar, Larry told me you went
sissy up at Casitas.	You
couldn't do the time so you
found yourself a big white boy

to look after you.	He said
they call you 'Sugar' because
you gave it out so sweet.

Exley flips the toggle.


#3 ROOM

The speaker over Larry Fontaine's head crackles to life.

COATES (V.O.)
Larry gave it at Casitas!	Man,
I was the fuckin' boss jocker on
my dorm!	Larry's the sissy!

Larry gave it for candy bars!


#1 ROOM

Exley flips up the second toggle.

EXLEY

Ray, you protected Ty and Larry
up in Casitas, didn't you?

COATES
You ain't woofin' I did.	Stupid
down home niggers got no more
sense than a fuckin' dog.

Exley flips the switches off.

EXLEY
I heard you like to shoot dogs.

COATES
Dogs got no reason to live.

EXLEY

Oh?	you feel that way about
people, too?

COATES
Man, what're you saying?

EXLEY
Ray, we got the shotguns.

COATES

I don't own no shotguns.

EXLEY

Why were you throwing clothes
in the building incinerator?

COATES
 
(trembling)
Say what?

EXLEY

You guys were arrested this
morning, but none of you have
last night's clothes.	You were

seen burning them.	Add to that
the fact that you hid the car
you were cruising around in
last night and it doesn't look
good.

COATES

I got nothin' more to say till
I see a judge.

EXLEY
Were you on hop?	You were passed

out when you got arrested.	Were
you hopped up, Ray?

COATES
Ty and Larry fuck with that
shit, not me.

EXLEY

Where do they get their stuff?
Come on.	Give me one to feed
the D.A.	Just a little one.

Coates nods. Exley flips up the toggles as he leans in.

COATES
Roland Navarette.	Lives on
Bunker Hill.	He runs a hole-up

for parole absconders and sells
red devils.

Exley flips down the switches, stands.

EXLEY
I'm going to take a break.

Exley opens the door, looks back in afterthought.

EXLEY
You know, Ray, I'm talking about

the gas chamber and you haven't
even asked me what this is all
about.	You got a big guilty

sign around your neck.

Exley exits.


OBSERVATION ROOM

Exley enters.
 
DUDLEY
Masterful, Edmund.	Your father
would've been proud.
(pointing)

This one's on the verge.

Exley looks through the glass into #2. Larry Fontaine is weeping. A piss puddle on the floor by his chair.

EXLEY
Fontaine next, but give Jones
the newspaper.	I want him

primed.


#2 ROOM

Fontaine tries to control his sniffles as Exley enters.

EXLEY
Larry, Ray Coates ratted you
off.	He said the Nite Owl was

your idea.	You want to tell me
about it?

No answer.

EXLEY
I think it was Ray's idea.	Talk
and I think I can save your life.

No answer.

EXLEY

Larry, this is a gas chamber job.
If you don't talk, you'll be dead
in six months.

No answer.

EXLEY
Son, six people are dead and
somebody has to pay.	It can be
you or it can be Ray.

No answer.

EXLEY
Larry, he called you queer.	He

said at Casitas you took it up
the ass.	He said --

FONTAINE
I DIDN'T KILL NOBODY!

The voice is strong, full of conviction. Exley glances at the mirror. Then...

EXLEY

Why'd you burn the clothes?
 
FONTAINE
(sobbing)
I just wanted to lose my cherry.
I didn't mean to hurt her.

Exley can't hide his surprise at this.
