EXLEY
Hurt who?	Was she a hooker?
Hurt who?

But Fontaine is gone. Head lolling, eyes squeezing out tears.


OBSERVATION ROOM

Exley steps out of the interrogation room. Dudley braces him.

DUDLEY
Don't get sidetracked.	Stay with
the Nite Owl.

EXLEY
She may still be alive, whoever
she is.

Bud's all ears.


#3 ROOM

Reading, Jones has his feet on the table. Exley bursts in.

JONES

This newspaper shit ain't shit.

EXLEY
Where's the girl?	Did you kill her?

No answer, but Jones looks nervous.

EXLEY
You wanted Larry to lose his
cherry, but things got out of

hand.	Is that right?


OBSERVATION ROOM

Everyone's attention is riveted, particularly Bud's.
They watch, listen over the speaker.

EXLEY
(over speaker)

Kick loose, Jones.	I know you
made her bleed, but that doesn't
mean you killed her.
 
No answer, but Jones is squirming.

EXLEY
(over speaker)

If that girl's alive, you've
still got a chance on this one.

JONES
(over speaker)
I think she's alive.

EXLEY

(over speaker)
You think?

Jack turns to Dudley.

JACK
He's good.	I'll give him that.

They don't notice as the chair back begins to splinter in Bud's hands.


#3 ROOM

Exley sits across from him, tries to wrap it up.

EXLEY

Where is she now?
(no answer)
Did you leave her someplace?

(no answer)
Did you sell her out?	Give her

to some of your buddies?	Tell
me where the girl is!

The door blasts open. Bud slams Jones up against the wall. As Exley stands, he bangs his knee on the table. Pulling a .38, Bud breaks the cylinder, drops 5 shells on the floor.

BUD
One in six.	Where's the girl?

EXLEY
Officer White, put down that
weapon and --

Bud shoves the barrel into Jones' mouth, pulls the trigger twice. CLICK, CLICK. Jones starts to slide down the wall. Bud jerks him back up, roars.

BUD

WHERE?!

Two more clicks.	Jones spills.

JONES

S-sylvester F-fitch one-o-nine
and Avalon gray corner house...
 

EXT. AVALON BOULEVARD - EVENING

A four cordon. They coast up to a GRAY CORNER HOUSE. Dudley Smith behind the wheel of the lead cruiser. Bud White rides shotgun, reloading his revolver.

BUD

Give me one minute.

DUDLEY

You've got it, Wendell.


STREET

Bud is out the door and scooting down an alley. Exley moves to follow, but Dudley cuts him off.

DUDLEY
We're going through the front.


ALLEY

Bud vaults a fence, pads up the back porch. A screen door. Bud slips the catch with a penknife and walks inside.


SCREEN PORCH

Bud heads for a blind-covered door. Unlocked, he enters...


A HALLWAY

Light bouncing from side rooms. We hear the opening spiel of "Badge of Honor" from the left. Bud wheels into a...


BEDROOM

A NUDE GIRL spread-eagled on a mattress. Bound with neckties. One in her mouth. Her eyes grow wide at the sight of Bud, then flicker to the adjoining room. Directing him. Raising the .38, Bud enters...


THE KITCHEN

Sylvester Fitch sits naked at the table wolfing Rice Krispies and watching "Badge of Honor" on a flickering TV. He looks up, sees the .38 before he sees Bud beyond it. Fitch drops his spoon, raises his hands.

Bud SHOOTS him in the face.	Dead, Fitch just sits there.
 
Bud moves behind him. Pulling a spare piece from an ankle holster, Bud FIRES back at the door from Fitch's line of fire, then puts the gun in Fitch's hand.

We hear the FRONT DOOR CRASH OPEN. As Fitch slides off the chair to the floor, Bud dumps the Rice Krispies on him.


EXT.	GRAY HOUSE - NIGHT

The Girl on a stretcher. Being carried to an AMBULANCE. Bud White walks alongside, looking like some ferocious pet pit bull. The ATTENDANTS get her inside. One joins her. The other closes the door, pauses to light a smoke.

Bud rips the cigarette out of his mouth, nearly taking the guy's lips with it.

BUD
Get her to the fucking hospital.

One look at Bud, and the Attendant is running around to the driver's side. Exley arrives, steamed.

EXLEY
A naked guy with a gun?	You
expect anyone to believe that?

BUD
Get the fuck away from me.

Bud starts away, but Exley gets right in his face. Other cops begin to take notice. The ambulance pulls out.

EXLEY
How's it going to look on your
report?

BUD
It'll look like justice.	That's
what that fat fuck got.	Justice.

EXLEY

You don't know what the word means,
you dumb bastard.

Bud goes after Exley, but ten hands pull them apart. Dudley on Exley. Four cops genuinely having trouble on Bud.

And as if things couldn't get crazier, shouts from the cops on the street. POLICE RADIOS CRANKED UP.

DISPATCHER (V.O.)
Repeat, three suspects escaped
from the Hall of Justice jail.

The Nite Owl killers:	Raymond
Coates, Tyrone Jones and Larry
Fontaine.	They are considered
armed and extremely dangerous.
 
Descriptions are as follows...


INT. SQUAD ROOM - DAY

Electrified, "Nite Owl Killers" on everyone's lips. Exley strides through with purpose, beelines to a filing cabinet. Exley pulls the file he's looking for. He scans an interrogation transcript, reads to himself the words he's looking for:

EXLEY

'Give me one to feed the D.A....
Roland Navarette.	Lives on
Bunker Hill.	Runs a hole-up for
parole absconders.'


INT. HOLLYWOOD STATION - JACK'S DESK - DAY

Police rush back and forth. Exley hurries over to the desk, but he's not there.

EXLEY

Anyone seen Jack Vincennes?

A few cops mumble they haven't. As Exley decides what to do, Carlisle from the original arrest steps over.

CARLISLE
Is something up, Lieutenant?


EXT.	1ST & OLIVE - DAY

Exley and Carlisle pull up across the street from a four-story Victorian with paint peeling off the clap-boards. They jump out of the car toting SHOTGUNS. Carlisle waits as Exley checks the mail slots: "R. Navarette, 408. "


INT.	STAIRWELL - VICTORIAN BUILDING - DAY

Exley and Carlisle take the steps two at a time.


INT. 4TH FLOOR HALLWAY - VICTORIAN BUILDING - DAY

Exley squints, reaches to a pocket. No glasses. He passes an elevator, rounds a corner. There's 408. Exley pumps the shotgun, nods to Carlisle who kicks the door in.


NAVARETTE LIVING ROOM

Exley and Carlisle burst in on four men eating sandwiches. Fontaine and Caucasian NAVARETTE at a table. Coates on the floor. Jones by the window. Exley squints.
 
EXLEY
Nobody move!

Fontaine and Navarette raise their hands. A jostled BEER BOTTLE CRASHES to the floor. Reacting, Carlisle JERKS the TRIGGER. Fontaine goes down.

Navarette draws a .38, SHOOTS Carlisle twice in the chest. Exley BLASTS Navarette.

Screaming, Jones pulls a .45 from his belt. Exley FIRES, blowing him right THROUGH the WINDOW.

Coates draws and FIRES, makes a run for it. A bad pull takes out half a back wall. Coates is out the door.


ELEVATOR

Coates makes it inside, frantically pushes buttons.


HALLWAY

Here comes Exley. Stumbling, wiping Navarette's blood out of his eyes, he closes on the...


ELEVATOR

Coates watches as the elevator doors begin closing.


HALLWAY

Exley charging.


ELEVATOR

The shotgun barrel juts through. The doors bang against it. BLAM!

DISSOLVE TO:

L.A. MONTAGE

TONY BENNETT belts "BOULEVARD OF BROKEN DREAMS."


INT. HOLLYWOOD STATION - DAY

Exley returns to grudging respect. His white shirt flecked with blood, he's clapped on the back by Dudley who dubs him "Shotgun Ed." Exley doesn't enjoy it. He's numb, stumbling along. As he notices the blood on his hands...


INSERT - NEWSPAPER HEADLINE
 
NITE OWL HERO!	Over a photo of Exley.


EXT. CEMETERY - GRAVE - DAY

A coffin is lowered into the ground. A WIDOW leans on the Chief's arm, accepts a tri-folded American flag from Dudley Smith. Exley drops a handful of earth on the casket, has trouble getting the wet dirt off his hands.

CHIEF
We mourn the passing of a good
man.	The loss of Sgt. William
Carlisle is the loss of his
wife, his family and the entire
Los Angeles Police Department...

A sea of dress blues. Jack looks bored, dressed too flashy for a funeral. Bud looks grim, rain dripping off the brim of his cap. As a TWENTY-ONE GUN salute is FIRED...


EXT. CEMETERY (SOUTH CENTRAL, L.A.) - DAY

Larry Fontaine's mother mourns alone as her son is buried.


INT. CITY OF ANGELS HOSPITAL - RECEPTION AREA - DAY

Exley talks with a tough, starchy NURSE.

EXLEY

I need the girl to give me a
chronology of events.	No details.
Just times.

NURSE

Absolutely not.	She barely
remembers her own name.

EXLEY
But --

NURSE
I was told the case was closed.
Should I call your superior to
double-check?

EXLEY
No.	that won't be necessary.

The Nurse turns, marches away. Exley is left with a nagging doubt.


EXT. ORANGE GROVE (ANAHEIM) - DAY

People cheer as bulldozers mow down orange trees. A banner heralds the future: "On this site: The World's
 
Biggest Amusement Park." Cartoon characters dance among the fallen trees.


INT. STATE ASSEMBLYMAN'S OFFICE - DAY

Sitting behind a desk is the Older Gentleman last seen doing his best Alan Ladd impersonation at Lynn Bracken's.

He stares emphatically at the SMARMY LAWYER who stands before him holding a manila folder.

OLDER GENTLEMAN
You tell Mr. Patchett I have no
intention of changing my vote.

The Lawyer simply hands him a stack of photographs. From Lynn Bracken's apartment. The first is the Older Gentleman naked except for his socks and garters.


INT. STATE ASSEMBLY - CHAMBER - DAY

The Older Gentleman rises for an assembly vote.

OLDER GENTLEMAN
It may surprise some, but a mature
man, enlightened by the facts, can
change him mind...


EXT. 1736 NOTTINGHAM (LYNN BRACKEN'S) - NIGHT

Rain. A limo disgorges a heavy-set man who climbs steps, knocks on the door. Lynn answers in an evening gown. He gives her a peck on the cheek and continues in past her.

Lynn's about to follow him in when she pauses to deadpan a look down the street.

Bud's Packard is parked there and we can see his darkened silhouette behind the wheel. Smiling a bit sadly to herself, Lynn disappears inside.

This is no stake-out. Bud watches after her with yearning.


INT. TROCADERO CLUB - NIGHT

Cigarette girls and club photographer make the rounds.
Johnny Stompanato enjoys the frenzien floor show.


EXT. WILSHIRE BOULEVARD - DAY

A horse parade, heavy on the law enforcement contingent, Out of place in his suit and tie, District Attorney Ellis Loew awkwardly rides atop a sleek Palimono.
 


INT. OLYMPIC AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
 
The crowd in a frenzy as Vincennes-snitch, the welterweight black boxer, beats the shit out of a white fighter.


INT. MIDDLE CLASS LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

A father holds out his hand, counts along as Jack slaps $100 bills into his palm. Maybe four thousand dollars.

Jack says something about "We appreciate your understanding during this difficult time." As "Badge of Honor" comes on the TV, the father responds with "Goddamn actors."

Leading, Jack looks through an open door where Brett Chase's high school "Sweater Girl" is being comforted by her mother. As she locks eyes with him an instant...


INT. PIERCE PATCHETT'S HOUSE - NIGHT

The monied johns watch horny as hell as "Ginger Rogers" twirls around the room with a female "Fred Astaire." Clothes fly as they spin. Still, most eyes turn to Lynn Bracken as she enters oozing that cat-girl grace.


EXT. POLICE HEADQUARTERS - DAY

Reporters scribble as the Chief speaks. Uniforms everywhere along with Exley and Loew. Bus sits in the back.

CHIEF
Edmund J. Exley has amassed a
brilliant record in his seven
years with the L.A.P.D.	Recently
he evinced spectacular bravery in
the line of duty.	It is my honor
to present him with our highest

honor, the Medal of Valor.

Exley steps up. The Chief hangs a gold medallion around his neck. Flashbulbs pop as the two men shake hands.

Exley then accepts a handshake from Dudley. The policemen stand on cue, applaud without enthusiasm. Dudley lifts the medal from his chest.

DUDLEY

Your father would've been proud.

Exley uses the noise to have aprivate chat with Dudley.

EXLEY

There are loose ends out there,
Dudley.	I --

DUDLEY
 
There always are.	But there are
also three men and three guns.
Matched forensically.	A few loose
ends don't matter.

EXLEY
Something's wrong.	I feel it
inside.	Doesn't that sound crazy?

Dudley puts an arm around Exley's shoulder, smiles out as more bulbs flash.

DUDLEY
Breaking a big case sticks you in
a whirlwind.	A little self-doubt?
It's natural.	Just keep it
inside.	Between you and you.

Exley considers his medal.	It is an appealing thing.

In the back, Bud stays sprawled in his seat. No one's watching as he takes out his gun, kisses it, and blows pretend smoke off the barrel. As the song ends...


INT. VARIETY INTERNATIONAL PICTURES - STAGE 4 - NIGHT

A	"Badge of Honor" fund-raiser for D.A. Loew's re-election cmpaign. Hot dogs and sauerkraut. Fishbowls stuffed with cash. Jack is here, returns a smile half-heartedly. Loew sits with his wife and teenage daughter as Brett "Joe Reno" Chase speaks.

CHASE

This election is about the future
of law enforcement in Los Angeles.
Ellis Loew represents that future.

So dig deep and let's get a moral
man re-elected.

Applause. Leaving the podium, Chase smiles at Ellis Loew's daughter who absolutely gushes. Chase then winks knowingly to Jack who returns a tired, humorless smile.

Jack scans the room. An odd moment as Jack catches his own reflection in a mirror across the way. He puts a hand to his face. Is that him?

HUDGEON (O.S.)

Big V Jack Vincennes!

Jack turns to see Sid Hudgeons approaching.

HUDGEONS

You're back, boychick.

JACK

Sid, how are they hanging?

HUDGEONS
Down around my ankles.
 
Hudgeons scans the crowd, points someone out.

HUDGEONS

You remember Matt Reynolds?

Jack spots Matt Reynolds -- one of the young actors Jack arrested on Christmas Eve.

HUDGEONS
The Grauman's Chinese pot bust.
He just got off the honor farm.

JACK

What's he doing here, Sid?

HUDGEONS

You tight with the D.A., trash?

JACK
Sure, he just tried to throw me
off the force last Christmas as a

little joke.

HUDGEONS
How'd you like a little payback?
Not to mention a donation to the

widows and orphans fund.	Did you
know Loew was a swish?

JACK
And Reynolds?

HUDGEONS

He's queer too.	Metro paid him
two grand a week to fake it with
ingenues.	On screen and off.	I'm

getting him to fuck the D.A. for a
hundred bucks.
(winks)
That's twice the fifty you got for
wrecking his career.

Even Jack's not immune to a comment like that.

HUDGEONS
Matt!	Over here!

As Hudgeons heads over, Hudgeons points out...

HUDGEONS
That's D.A. Loew right there.

Reynolds gets a nervous bead on Loew.	Hudgeons realizes:

HUDGEONS
You need a drink, kid... Jack,

look after him a minute.	Kid,
this is Jack.	No secrets between
me and him.
 
Hudgeons heads off.	Reynolds, plae, nods at Jack.

REYNOLDS
Have we met before?

JACK
Yeah.

Jack doesn't really feel like talking to him. Reynolds' nerves won't let him stay quiet.

REYNOLDS

Was it a party?

JACK
Something like that.

REYNOLDS
(misreading)

Oh, I know.	A Fleur-de-Lis party,
right?

Jack remembers the name, plays along for what it's worth.

JACK
Fleaur-de-Lis.	'Whatever you
desire.'

REYNOLDS

Dope, liquor, hookers that look
like movie stars.	Pierce Patchett
has it all.

Jack recognizes the name, bluffs for more information.

JACK
Yeah.	Me and Patchett go way
back.

REYNOLDS
Pierce isn't like regular people.
I dig him, but he scares me too.

JACK

Really?	How?

REYNOLDS

(shakes his head)
You know, when I came out to L.A.,

this isn't exactly where I saw
myself ending up.

JACK
Yeah.	Me neither.

Reynolds looks like he's going to cry. Hudgeons returns with a double Scotch straight up and a hot dog with sauerkraut. He hands the drink to Matt.

HUDGEONS
Dutch courage, kid.	Drink up.
 
Reynolds downs a few gulps, looks across the room at Loew.

REYNOLDS
I don't know if I should do this.

HUDGEONS
Hey, it's not like you don't know
how.	And Jack here has
connections on 'Badge of Honor.'
Pull this off and there'll be a

part for you.	I smell a comeback.
Don't you, Jack?

Reynolds looks to Jack who gives a noncommittal shrug.

JACK
Loew's free.	Congratulate him.

Reynolds nods, drains his glass and heads off. Hudgeons hands Jack a folded slip of paper.

HUDGEONS

If Reynolds works his charms,
which he will, this is the address
where they'll be.	Meet me at

midnight.	I guarantee all sorts
of illegal activity.

Hudgeons takes out a President Grant $50 bill. Jack doesn't take it.

JACK

Sid, why would a guy like Pierce
Patchett get involved with running
dope and hookers?

HUDGEONS

Where'd you hear that?

JACK

Around.

HUDGEONS
Jackie, all I know is what you
know.	The man is very rich.	And

he's invested in freeway
construction so he's gonna get a

lot richer.	But that's it.
Patchett's what I like to call
'Twilight.'	He ain't queer, he

ain't Red, he can't help me in my
quest for prime sinuendo.

Jack takes the $50 as Reynolds returns, shaking his head.

HUDGEONS
What?

REYNOLDS
 
I can't do it.

HUDGEONS
Talk to him, Jack.	Tell him about

the opening on the show.

JACK

I'm pretty sure I can get you a
part on the show... But tonight?
Pretend it's an acting job, kid.
Showbiz.

REYNOLDS
And no one'll know about this?

JACK
It'll be our secret.

REYNOLDS

Showbiz.

Emboldened by Jack's promise, Reynolds heads off. Jack and Hudgeons watch as he strikes a conversation with Loew who's captivated. Hudgeons chomps a bite of his hot dog, gives Jack the high sign, but Jack just feels like a pimp.


INT. VICTORY HOTEL - ROOM SIX - NIGHT

Screams. A cauliflower-eared Cleveland mob enforcer on the hotseat.

Breuning works him with a rubber hose as Dudley asks unanswered questions. Bud watches, revulsion growing.

DUDLEY
Where did you intend to start.
Prostitution?	Gambling?
(no answer)
Go back to Cleveland, lad.	This
is the City of Angels and you
haven't got any wings.

More screams as the hose thwops down. Bud looks away, then shuffles blindly out of the room.


INT. VICTORY HOTEL - BATHROOM - NIGHT

Bud runs water in the sink to drown out the SCREAMS. It doesn't work. Finally, he leans down and sticks his head under the stream of water. That doesn't work either.


EXT. VICTORY HOTEL - NIGHT

Hair dripping wet, Bud makes it to his car. The tires spit gravel as he tears away. Dudley appears in the doorway, watching curiously. As cauliflower continues to SCREAM...
 
INT. BUD'S PACKARD - 1736 NOTTINGHAM (LYNN'S) - NIGHT

Bud watches Lynn Bracken's apartment, Colored lights play on the windows. Shadows pass. Finally the front door opens. There's Veronica Lake, all sparkles and spangles, kissing another distinguished gentleman goodnight. Bud watches the man into a waiting limo. As it pulls away...


INT. 1736 NOTTINGHAM (LYNN BRACKEN'S) - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Now Lynn just looks tired. As she puts away Scotch bottles and picks up empty glasses, there's a KNOCK on the door. Lynn sighs, become sultry Veronica Lake before our eyes.


INT. FRONT HALL - NIGHT

LYNN
(opening door)
Did you forget some --

Bud stands there, filling up the door frame.

LYNN

I wondered when you might ring the
bell again, Officer White.

BUD
It's Bud.

Bud looks at Lynn a moment, then down at his own feet.
Embarrassed.	She smiles.

LYNN

You should see yourself.	You look
like you're ten years old.

Bud looks back up. Lynn's smile fades as she studies his face. She's not going to ask questions. Lynn looks at him a moment more, then runs a hand through the blonde hair covering one eye.

LYNN
If you'd called first, I wouldn't

look this ridiculous.


INT. LYNN BRACKEN'S (1736 NOTTINGHAM) - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Lynn comes to Bud naked, her hair brushed back. Bud goes slow, gently, takes time with his kisses: like she was a lonely woman he wanted to love to death.

Lynn plays off his timing: her kisses back, her touches. Finally, Bud forces himself to stop. He pulls back so he can see her.
 
LYNN

You're wondering if Patchett told
me to be receptive.

Bud doesn't answer, but yes.

LYNN
It doesn't matter.	I like you,
Bud.	I really do.

She kisses him. Softly, drawing it out. Not a job. She wants to make love to him. And as Bud stops thinking...


EXT. 5261 CHERAMOYA AVENUE (HOLLYWOOD) - NIGHT

Jack sits in his car waiting.	He checks his watch...
1:30.	Well past midnight.

JACK
Come on, Sid.	Where are you?

Jack decides. MOVE WITH him as he gets out and crosses the street. The apartment is dark, the front door a few inches ajar. Suspicious, Jack listens. Dead quiet. He enters...


INT. 5261 CHERAMOYA AVENUE - NIGHT

No one here it seems. Till Jack nearly trips over a body. Matt Reynolds. Soaked in blood. Throat slit. Jack looks down in horror as Reynolds seems to stare back up at him. Jack stumbles out the door. We hear his CAR DOOR SLAM shut, the SCREECH of RUBBER down the street.


EXT. 2345 HALBORO (HUDGEONS' HOUSE) - NIGHT

Jack pounds on Sid's door till lights switch on.

JACK
It's Vincennes!	Open up!

Hudgeons opens the door.	He's in his pajamas.

HUDGEONS
Jackie!	You got some good scoop

for the Sidster?

JACK

Sid, cut the crap.	I --

HUDGEONS
Give me some Narco skinny.	I want
to put out an all hop-head issue.

Shvartze jazz musicians and movie
stars.	Maybe tie it into the
Rosenbergs.	You like?
 
Jack grabs him, jerks him into the door frame.

JACK
Shut up!

HUDGEONS
(confused)
What's wrong, Trash?

HUDGEONS
What happened with the kid and
Loew?

HUDGEONS

You didn't get my message?	It got
called off.	The kid chickened out
at the last minute.

JACK

He's dead.	I was just there.
Somebody slit his throat.

HUDGEONS
Jesus.	Jack, that's a story.
'Swish Actor Gets The Gay Blade.'
Let me get my camera.

Hudgeons starts away, but Jack grabs him.

JACK
Loew didn't go with him.	You're
sure?

HUDGEONS

I put Reynolds in the cab myself.
The night cost me a hundred scoots
and I got bupkis.

Jack lets go of him, starts to ramble off into the night.

HUDGEONS
Jackie!	Big V!	Let me get my
camera!	Where are you going?!


INT. AFTER HOURS CLUB - NIGHT

The BARTENDER walks down the bar to where Jack arrives.

BARTENDER
What'll it be, Jack?

JACK
(pulls out wallet)
A bottle of Scotch.

As the Bartender turns for one, the only bill Jack finds is the President Grant fifty. The things he's done for fifty bucks... As he looks up with despair at his reflection in the bar mirror, the Bartneder sets down a bottle and shot glass. He plucks the fifty from Jack's
 
hand.

Jack grabs the bottle and starts out.

BARTENDER
Hey!	Your change!


INT. 1736 NOTTINGHAM (LYNN BRACKEN'S) - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Spent, Bud and Lynn lie in bed. SHe traces a finger over his bicep as he muses on the ceiling.

BUD

Who was that guy who was here
earlier?

Lynn's tracing finger stops on Bud's shoulder -- a small white scar.

LYNN
It doesn't matter.	All they get
is Veronica Lake.	You got the
real Lynn Margaret Bracken...
(re: scar)
Where'd this come from?

BUD
When I was ten, my old man threw a
bottle at my mother.	I guess I
got in the way.

LYNN
So you saved her.

BUD
Yeah.	But not for long.

Bud looks away. Lynn sees he doesn't want to talk about it.

LYNN

Do you like being a cop, Bud?

BUD
I used to.	What I do now is
strong-arm.	Sitting duck stuff...

No, I don't like it.	If I could
work Homicide like a real

detective...

Lynn listens sympathetically.	Bud's opening up.

BUD

There's something wrong with the
Nite Owl.	That prick Exley shot
the wrong guys.	But they made him

a hero and whoever killed my
partner is still out there.

Frustrated, Bud pokes at his own chest.
 
BUD

In here I know it.	But I can't
prove it.	I'm not a detective.

I'm not smart enough.	I'm just
the guy they bring in to scare the
other guy shitless.

Bud looks away, embarrassed to have shown so much of himself. Lynn reaches over, turns his face back to her.

LYNN

You found Patchett.	You found me.
You're smart enough.	Be a
detective if that's what you want.

BUD

That simple, huh?

Lynn nods.	That simple.


INT. HOLLYWOOD STATION - EXLEY'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Exley looks up as a CLERK enters holding two files.

CLERK

I got the rap sheets on the black
guys, sir.	Coates and Jones got
charges a mile long.	But except
for some kid stuff, Fontaine's
clean.

EXLEY

Clean?

CLERK

More or less.

EXLEY
Until he gunned down six people.


EXT. GRIFFITH PARK - DAY

Exley stands in the trees as a PARK RANGER approaches.

PARK RANGER
I asked my men, Lieutenant.	No

one remembers any colored guys
firing shotguns.

EXLEY
Then who phoned in the report?

PARK RANGER
Not us.


INT. FORENSICS LAB - DAY
 
Ray Pinker looks up from his microscope as Bud enters.

PINKER
Bud White, what brings you down to

the basement?

BUD

I got a few Nite Owl questions.

PINKER
I don't know if you read the
papers, but that case is closed.

BUD

I'm tying up loose ends.	Padding
my report.	You know how it goes.

PINKER
What do you want to know?

BUD
Anything off.	Anything that
didn't make sense.

PINKER
You mean beside the fact that
thirty-five out of forty-five

rounds were gratuitous?	I can't
think of anything.

Pinker is ticked as Bud steps over to where a group of Nite Owl crime scene photos are posted on the wall. Bud pauses at a photo which shows the floor around the table. We see a high heel shoe, blood smears across the floor.

BUD
Whose shoe?

PINKER

Susan Lefferts.

BUD

(pointing)
If she was sitting here, then it's
facing the wrong way.	What are
these smears in the blood?

PINKER
It looks like she was flailing,

trying to get away.

BUD

But she's moving away from the
door.
(thinks; points)
Who was sitting at this table?

PINKER
Dick Stensland.
(a beat)
Had to be dumb panic.	If she knew
 
him she would've been sitting with
him... Right?

Bud wonders, maybe a puzzle piece just fell into place.

Pinker remembers something.

PINKER

You know, there is one thing.

Pinker rummages a shelf for a glass jar which he hands Bud. Inside are two wax-saturated cotton balls.

PINKER
Cotton balls.	I found them just
inside the meat locker door.

BUD

Ear plugs.

PINKER
Exactly.	At least one of those
animals had the brains to protect

his ears.

BUD
It doesn't exactly play like dumb
panic.

PINKER

What do you mean?

BUD

It's like they knew they were
going to kill everyone before they

went in...

PINKER

Yeah, so...

Bud just stares at the picture of Susan Lefferts.


EXT. LEFFERTS' HOUSE (SAN BERNARDINO) - DAY

A shingle shack dump. Bud walks the front steps, RINGS the BELL. Hilda Lefferts answers. She doesn't look so good.

BUD

Mrs. Lefferts, I'm Officer White
with the L.A.P.D.	I'd like to ask
a couple of questions.

MRS. LEFFERTS

Let my daughter rest in peace.

BUD

Five minutes.	That's all.
 


INT. LEFFERTS' HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
 
Pictures of Susan smile down from four walls. Vamp poses on a nightclub floor. Mrs. Lefferts is all twitchy and nervous, her eyes darting to a closed door.

BUD
Tell me about the boyfriend she
had.	The one you mentioned at the
morgue.

MRS. LEFFERTS
First I want to go on record as
saying that my Susie was a virgin
when she died.

BUD
Ma'am, I'm sure she was.

Mrs. Lefferts talks directly to a photo of her daughter.

MRS. LEFFERTS
Susie, I told you I didn't approve
of that boyfriend.	He was too old
for you.	You let him come into
this house and be fresh to me.	I
went out one day and old Mrs.
Jensen next door saw Susan's

boyfriend and another man and
thought she heard a ruckus.

BUD
What was that boyfriend's name?

MRS. LEFFERTS

We were never properly introduced.
Susan and I were fighting that
day.	She called him by a

nickname.	Muns or Lunts or
something.

BUD
Stens?	Was it Stens?

MRS. LEFFERTS

Maybe.	I don't know.

BUD

Look at a picture for me.

Bud hands her a snapshot of Stensland taken in Tijuana.
Out of uniform.	She recognizes him.

MRS. LEFFERTS
That's him.	That's him.

BUD
You said a neighbor heard a

ruckus.	Was it outside, inside?

Mrs. Lefferts' eyes go crazy, darting to a closed door.
Rolled towels are crammed against the bottom of it.
 
MRS. LEFFERTS

I don't know.	You'll have to
leave now, Officer.

Bud starts for the closed door.

BUD
What's through here?

MRS. LEFFERTS
No!	Please leave!

Bud kicks away the towels, opens the door, steps into...


DEN

Innocuous except for the smell.	It hits Bud right off.

MRS. LEFFERTS
Don't mind the smell.	I think a
rat died behind the wall... My
Susie was a good girl!

BUD
Easy.	Tell me about the ruckus.

MRS. LEFFERTS

I came home that night and there
was blood on the floor.	Susan
said Stams -- Stens had cut

himself.	They were acting
nervous.	And that Stens kept

going under the house.

As Mrs. Lefferts goes shrill, Bud beelines out the door.


EXT. LEFFERTS' HOUSE (SAN BERNARDINO) - DAY

Holding a flashlight, Bud crawls under the house, into...


CRAWLSPACE

Bud elbow-crawls over the dirt, between wooden pilings.

There's a long burlap sack ahead. It smells bad. Bud rips burlap. A rat's nest explodes. Bud sweeps a forearm at them. As they clear, he sees a gristle-caked human skull staring back, a .38 hole in the forehead.

Undaunted, Bud tears the burlap back further. He pats the corpse's pockets, comes up with a wallet. Bud checks the ID. "Turner Meeks." Bus knows him by that name and another.

BUD

Buzz Meeks... Holy shit.
 
EXT. LEFFERTS' HOUSE - DAY

Bud crawls out, blinking sunlight and gulping fresh air.

Mrs. Lefferts is there.	She's scared.

MRS. LEFFERTS

Was it... a rat?

BUD
Yeah.	A great big one.

Bud opens Meeks' wallet, pulls out a couple hundred bucks and gives them to Mrs. Lefferts.

BUD
Here.	Compliments of the Los
Angeles Police Department.


INT. FORENSICS LAB - DAY

Ray Pinker looks up from an autopsy as Exley enters.

PINKER
Hey, just in time for our stomach
of the week.	Frankfurters with

sauerkraut, French fries,
Coca-Cola, alcohol and sperm.
Jesus, what a last supper.

The stiff is Matt Reynolds! Pinker continues working away.

EXLEY
The Nite Owl.	Anything bothering
you about the case?

PINKER

Yeah.	The fact that you guys
won't let it get filed away.

EXLEY
What are you talking about?

PINKER
Bud White grilled me on it this
morning.	You know, he's not as
dumb as I thought.

As Exley's head swims...

EXT. LEFFERTS' HOUSE (SAN BERNARDINO) - DAY

Mrs. Lefferts waters the grass, watches as a car pulls up. Exley gets up, starts toward her. She drops the hose and runs for the front door Exley cuts her off.

MRS. LEFFERTS

Let my Susie rest in peace!
 
EXLEY
Mrs. Lefferts, I just want to ask
a few questions.

MRS. LEFFERTS
That other policeman already
checked under the house and found

not a thing amiss.

EXLEY
Officer White?

MRS. LEFFERTS
A sweet man.

EXLEY
(thinking
out loud)
Under the house.

MRS. LEFFERTS
All he found were rodents.	No
signs of foul play.	So there.

Exley spots the entrance to the crawlspace. He hurries over, enters nearly flat on his belly. Mrs. Lefferts calls in after him.

MRS. LEFFERTS

My daughter was a virgin!

EXLEY (O.S.)

I don't doubt it -- Oh, God.


INT. HOLLYWOOD STATION - JACK'S DESK - DAY

Jack sits unshaven and hung-over, the dregs of the Scotch bottle on the desk. He considers a framed "Badge of Honor" photo: Jack and Brett Chase, before a banner "To Protect and Serve." Jack punches a fist through it.


INT. LAPD - FORENSICS LAB - DAY

Exley walks alonside as a body bag is wheeled into the lab atop a gurney. Pinker steps over.

EXLEY

I need an I.D. ASAP.	You talk
only to me on this one.


INT. JACK'S DESK - DAY

Sitting in disgust, Jack spots something amidst all the clutter -- the Great Jerk-Off Books of 1962. He flips one over, looks at the Fleur-de-Lis stamp. Jack remembers something Matt Reynolds told him. He dials the phone.
 
JACK
Yeah.	Sergeant Jack Vincennes
requesting.	I need the home
address on a Pierce Patchett.

OPERATOR (V.O.)
Please hold, Sergeant...

As Jack waits, Exley appears in front of him.

EXLEY
I need to speak to you.

JACK

Give me a minute, will ya?

Exley clicks off the phone.

JACK

Damnit... What?

EXLEY

I want you to follow Bud White.

JACK
Even I'm not that crazy.

EXLEY
It's not a request.	I need to
know what White knows.	Follow him
or I'll have you pulled off 'Badge
of Honor.'	Permanently.

JACK

Yesterday that might've meant
something.	Pull me off.	You'd be
doing me a big favor.

EXLEY

Yesterday yes, today no.	What
happened last night?

JACK
Transfer me, suspend me.	Just
leave me alone.

EXLEY

You make a mistake?

JACK
Yeah.	My whole life.

Jack stands, heads out.	Exley follows; he needs help.

EXLEY
Listen, I think I made a mistake,
too.

JACK

I ain't a priest, Lieutenant.	I
can't hear your confession.
 
EXLEY

Do you make the three Negroes for
the Nite Owl killings?

JACK
What?

EXLEY

It's a simple question.

JACK

You should be the last person who
wants to dig any deeper into the
Nite Owl, Lieutenant.

Exley watches as Jack continues down a hall.	Then:

EXLEY

Rollo Tomasi.

Jack stops, looks back at him.

JACK

Is there more to that, or do I
have to guess?

EXLEY
Rollo was a purse snatcher.	My
father ran into him off duty.	He
shot my father six times and got
away clean.	No one even knew who

he was.	I made the name up to
give him some personality.

JACK
So what's the point?

EXLEY

Rollo's the reason I became a cop.
I wanted to catch the guys who
thought they could get away with

it.	It was supposed to be about
truth and justice and Rollo.	But
somewhere along the way I forgot
all that... How about you, Jack?
Why'd you become a cop?

Jack looks like he might cry, but smiles instead.

JACK
I	don't remember...

Both men are quiet a moment.

JACK
I'm trying to figure what angle

you're playing this time, but I
sure as hell can't see one.

EXLEY
 
I've given up angles for awhile.
I just want to solve this thing.

JACK

The Nite Owl was solved,
Lieutenant.

EXLEY
I want to do it right.

So does Jack.

JACK
Okay, college boy, I'll help you.
But I want half the collar.

EXLEY

A third.	I don't think we can
make a case without Bud White.


EXT. BROWN DERBY - DAY

A Packard pulls up out front. Bud gets out, heads inside. Another car pulls up across the street.


CLOSE ON JACK

Watching Bud.	Jack gets out, starts across the street.


INT. BROWN DERBY - BAR - DAY

At the bar, Johnny Stompanato looks over as Bud joins him. Stompanato isn't happy about it, but he smiles anyway.

STOMPANATO

Wendell White, how's tricks,
paesano?

BUD
I ain't your paesano, you wop
cocksucker.

Nervous, Johnny taps his pinkie ring on a bottle of beer.

STOMPANATO

What do you want, officer?

BUD

You remember an ex-cop named Buzz
Meeks?	He works for a guy named
Patchett.

Johnny taps his ring harder.	The bottle almost tips.

STOMPANATO

Should I?
 
BUD
His file listed you as a known
associate.	Now spill.

STOMPANATO
Oh, yeah.	That was a long time
ago.	Before your day.	The last

few years he's been muscle for
hire.	But I heard he's
disappeared.

BUD

More.

STOMPANATO
More's gonna cost you.
