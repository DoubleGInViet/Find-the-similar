Bud's hand flashes out, grabs Stompanato by the crotch.

BUD
How 'bout I give you your balls
back?

STOMPANATO

(in considerable
pain)
Before Meeks disappeared he was

popping off about trying to move
eighteen pounds of heroin.

BUD
Bullshit.	Where would a two-bit
ex-cop get 18 pounds of heroin?

STOMPANATO
Deuce Perkins.	Mickey C's
narcotics lieutenant.	The night

he got clipped, eighteen pounds of
Mickey's heroin went missing.

Bud loosens his grip.	Stompanato gasps for air.


DOOR

Jack peels in, catches a glimpse of Bud and Stompanato.

Too far away too hear anything, Jack quickly ducks out.


BAR

Stompanato's recovering.

STOMPANATO

Meeks is probably in Rio or
someplace like that by now.

BUD
He's under a tract house in San
Berdoo.	And he don't smell too
good.	What happened to the
 
heroin, Johnny?

STOMPANATO
I don't know.	I swear it!

Bud starts to raise a hand. Stompanato cringes, but Bud just slaps a twenty down on the bar and goes.


INT. BROWN DERBY - PHONE BOOTH - DAY

Jack's on the phone to Exley.

JACK

He's in the Brown Derby with
Johnny Stompanato.
(sees Bud exit)

Check that.	I gotta go.


EXT. 1736 NOTTINGHAM (LYNN BRACKEN'S) - DAY

Jack pulls up, sees Bud knock on the front door. It opens and Bud steps in. Jack doesn't see who opens it.


EXT. BUSHES - 1736 NOTTINGHAM (LYNN BRACKEN'S) - DAY

LEAVES RUSTLE. There's movement in the underbrush. Jack appears, followed by Exley. Jack pulls a gun as they near a window.

EXLEY
What's that for?

JACK
Bud White.	He sees us and we're
dead.

They press up to the glass for a partial view. Bud White sits on a footstool massaging a pair of women's feet. Jack and Exley exchange a long, curious look. This isn't the Bud White they're used to. A pair of woman's hands take Bud, the arms covered in glitter and satin.

The woman, Lynn Bracken, leans forward to kiss her policeman. It may have been a long day, but she's every inch Veronica Lake. Only the hair's not over her eye.

They stand, kiss again. Lynn's gown spills down around her ankles. Bud scoops Lynn into his arms and the two of them disappear into a bedroom. A long beat before...

JACK

Jesus... Maybe White's not so dumb
after all.

EXLEY
Rita Hayworth at the morgue and
now Veronica Lake with White.
What the hell's going on?
 
JACK

Movie star hookers.	Whatever you
desire... It's Fleur-fr-Lis again.

EXLEY
What's Fleur-de-Lis?

JACK

High line whores.	With plastic
surgery to look like movie stars.
And who knows what else?	It's run

by this guy Pierce Patchett.	You
want to talk to him?

EXLEY
Yeah.	But first I want to brace
Stompanato.


INT. BROWN DERBY - ENTRANCE - DAY

Exley and Jack enter.

EXLEY
Check the bar.	I got the restaurant.


RESTAURANT

Exley scans. There's Stompanato with a girl who looks amazingly like "LANA TURNER."

Engrossed, Stomapanato doesn't look up till Exley's nearly on top of him.

STOMPANATO

Hey, you want an autograph, write
to M-G-M.

EXLEY
Since when do two-bit hoods and
hookers give out autographs?

STOMPANATO
What?

As Stompanato stands, Exley flashes his badge.

EXLEY
L.A.P.D.	Sit down.

"LANA"
Who in the hell do you think you
are?

EXLEY

Take a walk, honey, before I haul
your ass downtown.

"LANA"
 
Who in the hell do you think
are?!

STOMPANATO

You are making a large mistake.

As Jack arrives, Lana tosses a drink in Exley's face.

"LANA"

Get away from our table!

EXLEY

(grabs her wrist)
Shut up.	Being cut to look like
Lana Turner doesn't mean you are
Lana Turner.

Jack pulls him aside.

JACK
She is Lana Turner.

EXLEY
What?

JACK
She is Lana Turner.


INT. EXLEY'S PLYMOUTH - SUNSET

Rolling.	The sky glows ahead.

EXLEY

How was I supposed to know?

A moment before Jack begins to laugh.	Exley joins him.


EXT. 1184 GRETNA GREEN (PIERCE PATCHETT'S) - NIGHT

Exley's Plymouth is parked on the street.


INT. 1184 GRETNA GREEN (PATCHETT'S) - LIBRARY - NIGHT

In a silk robe, the unflappable Pierce Patchett smiles at Exley. Jack stands alongside.

PATCHETT
I believe the Nite Owl's your area
of expertise, Mr. Exley.	I saw

you on television getting your
medal.
(turns to Jack)
And you're that other celebrity
Hollywood policeman, aren't you?

A beat. Exley and Jack don't look like they appreciate being joked with. Patchett finally sighs.
 
PATCHETT
I'll tell you what I told Officer
White when he asked me about
Susan's death.

EXLEY
(a look to Jack)
Bud White's been here?

PATCHETT
For the last time.	I may suborn
women into illicit activities, but

they're handsomely compensated, I
treat them well and make sure the
men they deal with show them every
due respect.

EXLEY
Is the Veronica Lake look-alike

one of your whores?

PATCHETT

A vulgar term, but yes.

EXLEY
What's her name?

PATCHETT
Lynn Bracken.

EXLEY
Why's she seeing Bud White?

PATCHETT

Why do men and women usually see
each other?

EXLEY
Anything else you want to add
before I talk to her?

PATCHETT

No.

EXLEY
Not good enough.

PATCHETT
(unfazed)

Then try talking to my lawyer.
Good evening, gentlemen.


EXT. 1184 GRETNA GREEN - NIGHT

Exley and Jack head for the car.

JACK
Guy's as cool as they come.

A call CRACKLES in over Exley's RADIO.	Exley picks up.
 
EXLEY

This is Exley.

DISPATCHER (V.O.)
Ray Pinker wants to talk to you,
Lieutenant.	Says he has your I.D.

EXLEY

Tell him Sergeant Vincennes is
coming in to talk to him.

JACK
What are you going to do?

EXLEY
I'm going to Lynn Bracken's.	I'll
meet you at the Dining Car.

JACK
Great.	You get the girl, I get
the coroner.


INT. LIBRARY (1184 GRETNA GREEN) - NIGHT

Watching Exley and Vincennes from the window, Patchett picks up the phone, dials.

HUDGEONS (V.O.)
(over phone)
Hush-Hush.	Off the record and on

the Q.T.


INT. 1736 NOTTINGHAM (LYNN'S) - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

KNOCKING on the door.	Lynn answers to reveal Exley.

EXLEY
Miss Bracken, I'm Lieutenant
Exley.

LYNN

I know who you are.	You're the
policeman Bud told me about.

EXLEY
Really?	What did White say?

LYNN
He said you were smart.	He also
said you were competing with your
dead father.	How did he put it?
Trying to measure up to a ghost.

Exley lets it pass.	As he enters...

EXLEY

Let's concentrate on my smarts.
Pierce Patchett made you, didn't
 
he?	He taught you how to dress
and talk and think and I am very
impressed with the results.	But I
need some answers and if I don't

get them, I'm going to take you
and Patchett down.

LYNN
He can take care of himself and
I'm not afraid of you.	And you
forgot one thing, Lieutenant.
Pierce also taught me how to

fuck... Can I get you a drink?

Exley can't help but smile.	Lynn smiles back.

EXLEY

Scotch.

Exley watches her as she steps over to fix the drinks.

LYNN

I'm curious about you.

EXLEY
Why?

She hands him his drink.

LYNN
Because Bud hates you more than he
loves me.

Exley stews.	Lynn watches him over the rim of her glass.

LYNN
It galls you that I know so much
about you.	You don't have
information to compete.

EXLEY
Don't underestimate me, Miss
Bracken.

LYNN
The way you've underestimated Bud
White?

Exley's had it. A menacing step forward. Lynn's smile becomes a laugh. Lost to himself, Exley leans in and kisses her. Lynn pulls back, then kisses back. In a beat, they're rolling to the floor, shedding clothes.

As they trash the furniture, Lynn looks over his shoulder at her own reflection in a closet door mirror.


REVERSE ANGLE - INSIDE CLOSET

Two-way glass. Sid Hudgeons is in here SNAPPING pictures. As Lynn and Exley continue with their frantic
 
lovemaking...


INT. FORENSIC LAB - NIGHT

Ray Pinker rubs his tired eyes.

PINKER
God bless dental records.	Stiff
used to be a cop.	Turner Meeks.

JACK

Buzz Meeks?

PINKER
You knew him?

JACK
Of him.	He was around when I

first joined the force.	A bad
egg.

Pinker could care less.	As Jack's wheels turn...


INT. LAPD - RECORDS ROOM - NIGHT

Jack searches dusty filing cabinets with dates like 1939 and 1940. Reading one headed "Meeks," Jack lets out a low whistle. He's found something.


INT. PACIFIC DINING CAR - NIGHT

Jack waits at the bar, watches the door anxiously.

JACK

Come on, Exley.	Where are you?


INT. 1736 NOTTINGHAM (LYNN'S) - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Spent, Exley and Lynn sit, half-dressed, on the floor.
They're quiet.	Then, through a smile:

EXLEY
How was I?

LYNN

Oh, the best I ever had.
Absolutely the best.

EXLEY
(laughs)
You sound like you mean it.

LYNN

The silver screen's loss is your
gain.

EXLEY
 
How about White?

LYNN
You want to know what Bud's like

in bed?

She actually embarrasses him with that one.

EXLEY

I want to know why you see him.
Is it a Patchett payoff?

LYNN
I see Bud because I want to.	I
see Bud because he can't hide the
warmth he has inside him.

EXLEY
I'll take your word for it.

LYNN

I see Bud because he makes me feel

like Lynn Bracken and not some

Veronica Lake look-alike who fucks

for money.	I see him because he
doesn't know how to disguise who
he is.	There's more if you want

to hear it.

Exley shakes his head.	He's heard enough.

LYNN

Does all that make it harder for
you to hate him or easier?

EXLEY
I don't hate White.	I really

don't.	It's just, in my business,
it's the wild cars you have to
watch out for.

LYNN

You don't like that you don't know
how to play him.	He doesn't
follow the same rules of politics
you do.	That makes him dangerous.

EXLEY
You cut to the heart of things,

don't you?	What about Lynn

Bracken?	She going to be a hooker
all her life?

LYNN

I came out here with a dream.
That's gone, but I settled for
reality.

EXLEY

Some reality.
 
LYNN
No.	This is the means to the
reality.	But I'm not going to
tell you what it is.

EXLEY
Why not?

LYNN

Because you'll use it against me.
Won't you?

Exley doesn't answer, but the answer is yes. Lynn smiles.

LYNN
You're tougher than Bud thinks you
are.

EXLEY
(smiles)
You're the first person to ever

call me tough.

LYNN
Like recognizes like.	I'm pretty
tough, myself.

EXLEY

You, me and White, huh?

LYNN

Actually, Bud's only tough on the
outside.

As Exley kisses her...


IN CLOSET

Exasperated that he's still stuck in here, Sid Hudgeons checks his watch, shakes his head in disgust.


EXT. 9608 VENDOME (SILVERLAKE) - NIGHT

Jack knocks at a darkened house. The porch lights come on. The door opens to reveal Dudley Smith in his bathrobe.

DUDLEY
John Vincennes.	It's three A.M.,
lad.

JACK
Two minutes, Dudley.	It's
important.

DUDLEY

Lucky for you that my wife and
four fair daughters are at the
 
beach in Santa Barbara.


INT. 9608 VENDOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT

Jack sits at the table while Dudley makes coffee.

JACK
You remember Buzz Meeks, Dudley?

DUDLEY
A disgrace as a policeman.
Straight D fitness reports from
every C.O. he ever served under.
What about him?

JACK

Twelve years ago he worked a vice
roust with Dick Stensland.	They

arrested a Pierce Patchett on an
extortion scam.	Guy ran hookers.
He'd have them photographed with

their johns, then double-dip for
some blackmail.	Charges got
dropped.	Insufficient evidence.
You were supervising officer on
the case and I was wondering if

you remember anything about it.

DUDLEY
What's this all about, lad?

JACK
Part of it has to do with a

murder.	I've been working with Ed
Exley on it.

DUDLEY
You're Narco, lad, not Homicide.
And since when do you work with
Edmund?

JACK
It's a private investigation.	I
fucked something up and I want to
make amends.

DUDLEY
(smiles, then...)

Don't start trying to do the right
thing, John.	You haven't had
enough practice.

Dudley walks over, hands Jack his coffee.

DUDLEY
Have you discussed this with

anyone else, John?

JACK
No.
 
DUDLEY

Not even with Exley?

Jack shakes his head. Dudley raises a REVOLVER. He FIRES it at point-blank range, right into Jack's heart. Jack hits the floor, his cheek pressed flat on the linoleum.

Jack opens his mouth to speak. His lips form the words, but no sound comes out. Dudley crouches down beside him.

JACK
Have you a valediction, lad?

Dudley leans low, gives Jack an ear.	As he dies...

JACK
Rollo Tomasi...

Dudley frowns in ignorance at the name.


INT. LAPD HEADQUARTERS - BRIEFING ROOM - DAY

Nothing mobilizes the police like losing one of their own. Dudley is at the podium along with Exley. Dozens of detectives take notes, including Bud White.

DUDLEY
Sergeant Vincennes' body was found
in Echo Park at ten o'clock this

morning.	Killed by a single .38
round to the heart.	One of our

own, gentlemen.	We cannot
tolerate it.	Justice must be
swift and merciless.	That's all.

As the men move odd, Dudley approaches Exley.

DUDLEY
Edmund, a word with you.	We
received a tip this morning.	Did
Vincennes ever mention the name
Rollo Tomasi?

Exley tries to look like he's thinking as Jack calls from the grave. Screaming the name Dudley!

EXLEY
No... Where'd the tip come from?

DUDLEY
Anonymous.	Probably nothing.

As Dudley moves off, Exley watches him go.	Scared.


INT. LAPD HEADQUARTERS - BUD WHITE'S DESK - DAY

Bud looks over as Dudley sits down across from him.
 
DUDLEY

You're perplexing to me these
days, Wendell.	You're not your

old, cruel self anymore.	I need
proof that the extracurricular

work I had planned for you remains

within your grasp.

BUD
What work?

DUDLEY
I've long been involved in
containing hard crime in such a
way that myself and a few
colleagues might someday enjoy a

profit dispensation.	That day

will soon be here and you'll share

handsomely.	Grand means will be
in our hands, Wendell.
(MORE)

DUDLEY (CONT'D)

Imagine crime limited to the
criminal element who perpetrate
it. Imagine the means to keep the

nigger filth sedated.	But don't
stop there.	Extrapolate.	Imagine
the police in control.	It's big,
lad.

BUD
You lost me, Dudley.	I don't know

what you're talking about.

DUDLEY

You have your extracurricular
secrets, I have mine.	We'll hold
a clarification session soon.	For
now, I need your fearsome old
habits at the Victory Motel.

We're going to brace a man who may
know who killed Jack Vincennes.
Can I count on you?

BUD

Sure, boss.	Sure you can.


INT. FORENSICS LAB - DAY

Pinker looks up as Exley enters.

EXLEY
I want to know what you and Jack

Vincennes talked about last night.

Anything and everything.	Start
with the I.D. on the corpse.

A put-upon Pinker sighs.
 
PINKER

An ex-cop.	Buzz Meeks.	I pulled
his police academy photo.

Pinker goes to his desk for a twenty-year-old photo of Meeks. he hands it to Exley, whose wheels are turning.

EXLEY

We got a dead ex-cop and a girl
who looks like Rita Hayworth at
the Nite Owl.	Another dead ex-cop

under the house of Rita's mother.
It's not a good week for ex-cops.

PINKER
I got Vincennes in the next room.
It's not a good week for cops in
general.


EXT. VICTORY MOTEL - DAY

A RAIN STORM has turned the courtyard into a mud bath. As usual, a light burns in room six. Bud White parks alongside the other cars already here. He makes a dash for the door.


INT. VICTORY MOTEL - ROOM SIX - DAY

Sid Hudgeons is cuffed to the hot seat. Dudley sits across from him. Dudley's henchman Breuning looms. Bud enters.

DUDLEY
This is Mr. Hudgeons, Wendell.

HUDGEONS

I'm happy to cooperate.	You don't
need to tie me down.

DUDLEY
It's for your own safety.	Now
what can you tell us about
Sergeant John Vincennes?

HUDGEONS
Trashcan Jack.	The Big V.	I can

tell you he's on the Night Train
to the big adios.

Breuning cuffs Hudgeons in the side of the head.

HUDGEONS
Take it easy!	I didn't have
anything to do with him getting

killed if that's what you mean.

DUDLEY
But you were business associates?
 
HUDGEONS

What does that have to do --

Breuning cuffs him again.

HUDGEONS

Okay so we worked together.	It
was an information exchange.	I
got him first class collars and he
got me good stories.	We were
friends for Chrissakes!

DUDLEY

Alright.	We'll drop that line for
now.	Next topic.	Please comment
on Pierce Patchett.

Bud looks over at mention of the name.

HUDGEONS
You think he had something to do
with Vincennes getting iced?

Dudley sighs, looks to Bud.

DUDLEY

Wendell.	I want full and docile
cooperation on all topics.

Hudgeons flinches as Bud steps up, twice Breuning's size.

HUDGEONS
Okay.	Okay.	Everyone knows

Patchett's worth a boat-load of
greenbacks.	From aviation,
freeway construction.	But the man

has hobbies, too.	He bankrolls B
movies under the table and runs
movie star look-alike hookers.
And try this on:	he's rumored to
be a periodic heroin sniffer.	All

in all a powerful behind-the-
scenes strange-o.

DUDLEY
And?

HUDGEONS

And what?

Bud digs a fist into Hudgeons' gut. As Hudgeons gasps to get his breath back.

DUDLEY
Reciprocity, Mr. Hudgeons, is the
key to all relationships.

HUDGEONS

He runs call girls.	Primo tail.
Fixed up like movie stars.
 
Bud looms, rests his hands on the back of Hudgeons' chair. He doesn't like where this is going.

DUDLEY
And?

HUDGEONS
In my car.	Blackmail shit.	The
trunk under the carpet.	Patchett
got me to photograph a cop fucking
this gorgeous cunt Lynn, looks

just like Veronicaaa --

Wooden slats pop as Bud tears the bolted chair right out of the floor. Hudgeons and the chair land sideways.

DUDLEY
Wendell!

Bud can't hear him. He uprights the chair one-handed. As his fist cocks back, he's restrained by Breuning and Dudley. This is no act. They can barely hold Bud back.

HUDGEONS
Get him away from me!

Bud breaks free, heads outside.


EXT. VICTORY MOTEL - HUDGEONS' CAR - DAY

Bud jams a tire iron into the trunk seam and pops it with a ferocious yank. He tears at the carpeting. A manila envelope. Bud rips it open and 8x10 glossies of Exley and Lynn spill out. Raindrops dot them, as Bud's in his Packard and tearing out of there.


INT. VICTORY MOTEL - ROOM 6 - DAY

Dudley and Breuning watch from the door.

DUDLEY

I wouldn't trade places with
Edmund Exley right now for all the
tea in China.

Breuning laughs.	So does Hudgeons.

HUDGEONS
Dudley, I thought you were gonna
let the dumb bastard kill me.
(to Breuning)
And you!	Learn to pull those
punches a little better.

Dudley and Breuning stare at him.	A bit grimly.

HUDGEONS
You can uncuff me now, fellas.
 
But no one moves to do so.

HUDGEONS

Fellas?
(nervous)
We had a deal.	You, me and

Patchett,	We're a team!
(scared)
Come on, we're friends.	We're --

As Hudgeons protests, Dudley slaps a hand over his mouth.

DUDLEY

Hush-hush...

As Breuning and Carlisle move in...


INT. RECORDS ROOM - LAPD - DAY

A wormish CLERK searches dusty filing cabinets with dates like 1939 and 1940. The same ones Jack looked through. Exley steps over from another row.

EXLEY
Anything?

CLERK

Nothing.

EXLEY

So on active duty, Meeks didn't
make an arrest from 1938 to '43.

CLERK
Someone must've pulled the
records.

Exley ponders the implications. Taking out the photo of Meeks, he gets an idea.

EXLEY
Where are the police academy
files?

CLERK

I don't have time.	I have --

EXLEY
Just show me where they are!


EXT. 1736 NOTTINGHAM (LYNN BRACKEN'S) - DAY

Blue, Lynn sits on her porch watching the rain come down.

A SCREECHING on the wet street as Bud's PACKARD pulls up.

She watches as he gets out and starts for the house. Lynn stands, holds her arms out. Bud stops short on the steps, out of reach, the rain soaking him.
 
BUD
Did you talk to Exley?

LYNN

Come in out of the rain.	In the
morning we'll have both our
stories for breakfast.

Lightning flashes.	Bud shakes hs head.

BUD
I want to know about Exley.

LYNN

He's the opposite of you.	He's
more like me.	Cold, calculating.

BUD
How'd you get to know so much

about him?

More lightning.	Lynn looks God-awful sad.

LYNN

Come in out of the rain, Bud.

BUD

You gonna tell me what happened
with you and Exley?

LYNN
We talked.

BUD

So tell me about it.

LYNN

(looking away)
In the morning.

BUD
No.	Now.
(a beat)
You fucked him.

Too tired to lie anymore, Lynn finally just nods.

LYNN
I thought I was helping you.	I

thought --

Bud backhands her, hard. Lynn faces straight into the next one as Bud hits her again. A third time as the sins of the father are visited on the son. Bud stops short as the self-realization slams home. Lynn waits stoically. She doesn't start crying till Bud turns and runs back into the rain.


INT. RECORDS ROOM - LAPD - DAY
 
Drawers are open. Files are everywhere. Exley's reached the end of the line. As he looks through one last file, he finds a stack of official photos. Then he stops short. There's a photo of four cadets and an academy instructor.

Two of the cadets are IDed as Turner Meeks and Dick Stensland. The instructor is Dudley Smith!

Exley looks up at the sound of FOOTSTEPS and Bud is there. Fury. He slams Exley, knocks him flat.

Bud's here to kill him. He hauls Exley up, pummels him, then throws him over the table. Then up into a wall. Plaster cracks. Bud's on some gonzo animal plane. Bud strangles him. Exley gags. It'll be over in moments.

Until Exley's flailing hands finds Bud's .38. Yanking it from his waistband, Exley smashes Bud in the forehead. Bud reels. But, blind with rage, he moves back in only to have the barrel of the .38 placed right between his eyes.

EXLEY

Why?

BUD

Lynn.

EXLEY
She told you?

Bud shakes his head.	He's coiled, ready to make a move.

EXLEY
Who told you?	Did Dudley have
anything to do with you finding

out?

Bud hesitates, the answer obvious.

EXLEY

Listen to me.	Dudley killed Jack.
It has something to do with Buzz
Meeks.

Exley points out the academy photo on the floor.

EXLEY

Look.	Dudley and Meeks go way
back.	Stensland, too.

Bud sees, but does he really? As Bud reaches for the photo, Exley relaxes slightly. Bud slaps the gun away, drops Exley to the ground. He grabs, begins slamming his head into the floor.

EXLEY
Think, goddamn you.	Think...

Exley's almost out.	But maybe Bud heard him.	The attack
 
slows, stops as Bud does think.	Exley stays conscious.
 

BUD
I knew Stensland and Meeks knew

each other.	Meeks was with Sue
Lefferts on Christmas Eve.	The
night I met Lynn.	Lefferts'

mother I.D.ed Stensland as
Lefferts' boyfriend, but Stens
pretended he didn't know either
one of them.

EXLEY
Stensland and Meeks.	What were
they up to?

BUD

Johnny Stompanato told me when
Meeks disappeared, he was trying

to move the 18 pounds of heroin
that went missing when Deuce
Perkins was shot.

EXLEY

Stensland and Buzz Meeks.	Two-man
triggers knocking off Mickey Cohen
lieutenants.	When they killed

Deuce Perkins, they got heroin as
a bonus.

BUD
Then something goes wrong.	Meeks
gets killed.	Maybe Stens got
greedy, killed Meeks and left him

under his girlfriend's house.
(a beat)
The night he died, Stens was all

mysterious.	Said he had something
big going down.

EXLEY
The Nite Owl!	Stensland was going
there to sell the heroin.

BUD
Somebody got wind of it, killed
them all.

EXLEY

It wasn't the Negroes.	The Griffith
Park report was a phony. And, who
says the purple Merc was spotted

outside the Nite Owl?

BUD
Dudley.

EXLEY
The first guys to the car when
Jack and I got there were Bruening
and Carlisle.
 
BUD

Dudley's guys.

EXLEY
They didn't find the shotguns.
They planted them.

BUD

It all keeps coming back to
Dudley.

EXLEY
It's Dudley for the Nite Owl.

They just stare at each other a beat as it sinks in.

EXLEY
Pierce Patchett figures in, too.

That's the angle Jack was working.
Dudley must work for Patchett.

BUD
Let's just kill them.

EXLEY
What?

BUD

For Jack, for Stensland, for
anybody else who got in the way.
I've been trying to be smart.	A

detective.	But killing those two
fuckers, that would be justice.

EXLEY
Stay smart, Bud.	We build a case.
We play by the rules.

BUD
There are no rules!	Why the fuck
are you doing this?	The Nite Owl

made you.	You want to tear all
that down.

EXLEY
With a wrecking ball.	You want to
help me swing it?

Bud smiles.	For a second he likes Exley.

EXLEY

Let's go see Pierce Patchett.	Run
a good-cop-bad-cop.

BUD
Which one are you and which one am

I?

EXT. 1184 GRETNA GREEN (PIERCE PATCHETT'S) - DAY
 
Exley and Bud make their way up the walk.	Bud pulls his

.38 from its shoulder holster, shoves it in his waistband.

EXLEY
You expecting problems?

BUD
Patchett uses a lot of ex-cop
muscle.


FRONT DOOR

Exley RINGS the BUZZER. Looking back, Bud sees a pitching wedge and pile of golf balls abandoned in the grass. A single ball floats in the koi pond. Bud's eyes narrow at the sight. Not like Patchett at all.

BUD
Come on.

And Bud shoulders the heavy door right off its hinges.


INT. 1184 GRETNA GREEN - HALLWAY - DAY

Bud draws his .38 as he strides in.	Exley tries to keep up.

EXLEY
(a screaming
whisper)

What?

Double doors on the left open into a library. Bud stops short, slowly lowers his gun. Exley steps up beside him.


LIBRARY

Hanging from a ceiling light, Patchett's body slowly twists around, a toppled chair beneath him.

EXLEY

I	don't think his ex-cop did him much good.

Bud goes to the body while Exley heads for a side table on which rests a typed sheet of paper.

Bud checks Patchett's right hand, the knuckles are split, two of the fingers badly distended.

EXLEY

It's a suicide note.	Says he
killed Jack because Jack had
figured out a pornography scam

Patchett was running.

BUD
He had help getting up there.	Two
 
of his fingers are broken.

EXLEY
We had one thing figured wrong.	I

don't think Dudley workd for
Patchett.

BUD
At least not anymore.

EXLEY
Patchett's dead.	He sent you
after me.	I'd say Dudley's tying
up his loose ends.

BUD
(it hits him)
Lynn.

Bud dashes to the PHONE, dials. It RINGS. No one answers.

EXLEY
I got a guy who owes me in the
Sheriff's department.	West
Hollywood station.	He can be at
her house in two minutes.

Bud shoves the phone into his hand.

BUD
Call him.


EXT. 1736 NOTTINGHAM (LYNN BRACKEN'S) - DAY

A county sheriff's unmarked parked out front. A DEPUTY behind the wheel. Exley's Plymouth pulls up behind. The Deputy gets out. MOVE WITH him as he steps BACK TO Exley, who's rolling down his window.

EXLEY

Is she inside?

DEPUTY
We took her to Hollywood Station
for safekeeping.	Someone worked

her over pretty good.	She
wouldn't say who.

Exley looks at Bud.	Bud looks down in shame.

EXLEY
Hold her as Joan Smith.	No one
sees her unless I okay it.

DEPUTY

You got it, Exley.	And now we're
even.

As the Deputy moves off.
 
EXLEY

Ellis Loew.

BUD
What about him?

EXLEY
Jack thought he was up to his neck
in all this.

INT. DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OUTER OFFICE - DAY

A SECRETARY looks up as Bud and Exley beeline Loew's door.

SECRETARY

You can't go in there!


INNER OFFICE

Loew looks up as they burst in.

SECRETARY
Do you want me to call the police,
Mr. Loew?

EXLEY

Ask for Captain Dudley Smith.
We'll have a party.	Hot dogs and
sauerkraut.

A beat as Loew considers his options.

LOEW
It's okay.	These are police.
(as she leaves)
What do you want?

EXLEY
I want D.A. bureau men to tail
Dudley Smith twenty-four hours a
day; I want you to get a judge to
authorize a wire tap on his home
phone; I want authorization to
check his bank records and I want

it all in an hour.

LOEW
On what evidence?

EXLEY
None.	Call it a hunch.

LOEW
(incredulous)

Absolutely not.	Dudley Smith is a
highly decorated member of this
city's police department and I
won't smear his name without --
 
EXLEY

Without what, his smearing yours
first?	What's he got on you,

Loew?	Pictures of you and an out
of work actor with your pants
down?

LOEW

Do you have any proof?

EXLEY

The proof had his throat slit.
(a beat)
So far you're not denying it.

LOEW

I'm not going to dignify youwith
answers.	If you'll excuse me,

I've got a Jack Vincennes press
conference to prepare for.

Loew enters his bathroom.	Bud looks to Exley who nods:
Go.


OFFICE BATHROOM

Loew is at the mirror clipping a few stray nose hairs.

Bud enters full of menace followed by Exley.

LOEW

Unless you're here to wipe my ass,
I think we're through.

Bud just glares at him.	Loew shakes his head.

LOEW
Don't try this good cop/bad cop
with me.	I practically
invented it.	And so what if some
homo actor is dead.	Boys, girls,

ten of them step off the bus to
L.A. every day.

The MIRROR SPIDERWEBS as Bud slams Loew's face into it. Bud swings him around, forces him forward and shoves his head in the toilet.

He holds it there, finally lets Loew up for breath. Then backhands: one, two, three.

BUD
Dudley Smith.	Spill.

LOEW
Call him off, Exley!

EXLEY

I don't know how.
 
More backhands. Holding Loew by the scruff of the neck, Bud marches him past Exley and back into the...


INNER OFFICE

Bud heaves up the window, practically throws Loew through it. Loew catches hold of the window framing. Bud hammers his hands loose with a fist and pushes him through.


OUTSIDE

Bud holds his leg. Loew screams as coins, comb and wallet spill from his pockets, plummet toward the street below.


INNER OFFICE

Bud shakes Loew, could drop him at any time.

EXLEY

Bud...

BUD

If I let you go, there'll be ten
more lawyers to take your place
tomorrow.	They just won't come on
the bus, that's all.


OUTSIDE

We hear Loew's PANT LEG TEARING loose.

LOEW
Okay!	You're right!	Dudley's got
photos of me and Reynolds.

EXLEY

What's Dudley's scheme?

More TEARING.	Loew's life may depend on the answer.

LOEW

Dudley's rotten to the core.	He's
taking over Mickey Cohen's

rackets, his own hand-picked
cops'll be the new franchise
holders.	Because of those

pictures I won't be able to
prosecute.	Oh Jesus pull me up!


INNER OFFICE

Exley helps pull Loew back inside. Bud dumps him on the floor. Bruised and bloodied, Loew looks up at Exley.
 
LOEW
Dudley's got everyone under his
thumb.	Not just me, but the Chief
of Police, the lieutenant

governor, everybody!

Exley pulls his .38, shoves it into the side of Loew's neck.

EXLEY
Not everybody.	You tip-off Dudley
and Officer White visits you alone

next time.

Loew looks at Bud, nods, his face a bloody mess.


EXT. CITY OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

Exley and Bud exit.	Bud's wheels are turning.

BUD

They never made a match on the
shotgun serial numbers.	What if
Breuning and Carlisle took them
from the evidence room?	Couple of
cold pieces that had been hanging

around a year or two.

EXLEY
We should check the records, and,
we should talk to Lynn.

Bud just stares at him a beat.

EXLEY
You want to talk to her?

Bud looks away, shakes his head "no."	Finally...

BUD
You do it.	I'll check the files.


INT. SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT - HOLDING ROOM - DAY

Lynn looks up as Exley enters. her face is puffy, swollen.

LYNN
(dry)
If I knew you were coming I'd have

baked a cake.

EXLEY
Forget everything else for a
second, Lynn.	Is there anything

you can give me on Dudley Smith?

A blank look from her.
 
EXLEY
A police captain.	I think he's
behind all of this.

LYNN
(shakes her head)
I work for Patchett.	I had a

feeling that there was someone
else, but I never knew who.

EXLEY
Okay.	Look, if it helps, Bud
hates himself for what he did.

LYNN
(a beat)
I know how he feels.

A beat as Exley wonders how he should interpret this.

EXLEY
I don't know if it's pathetic or
romantic, but when this is all
over I'd like to see you again.

Lynn looks away, can't help an ironic smile even as she starts to cry. As Exley gives her his handkerchief...


INT. LAPD - EVIDENCE ROOM - NIGHT

Bud waits at the cage window as a RECORDER returns with some information.

RECORDER
I got your guns, Bud.	Signed in
April 3rd, 1950.	Remember the

First Western bank robbery?	They
were used in that.

BUD
I want to see them.

RECORDER

No can do.	I can't find them.

As Bud thinks, a ROOKIE-TYPE approaches.

ROOKIE-TYPE

Uh -- Sergeant White?

BUD

What?

ROOKIE-TYPE
Dispatch just got a call for you.
Lieutenant Exley wants you to meet

him at the Victory Motel.
 


EXT. VICTORY MOTEL - SUNSET
 
Bud's Packard crests the rise looking down on the Victory. Exley's Plymouth is in the courtyard.


INT. VICTORY MOTEL - ROOM 6 - SUNSET

Exley in the hotseat. Sitting there thinking. At a CAR DOOR CLOSING, he goes to the door.


ANOTHER ANGLE

Exley opens the door as Bud approaches, toting a shotgun.

The sun is down.	The sky is just a dull glow.

BUD

You wanted to meet here?

EXLEY
Me?	You called it.	I got a
message that...

As the reality sinks in, Bud and Exley hear TIRES on the GRAVEL; CARS are COMING. Being in a concavity, they don't see them yet. Then the CARS STOP. But still Bud and Exley can't see anything. They hear the CLICKS of CAR DOORS OPENING, but they don't hear them shut. There are FOOTSTEPS, MURMURED WHISPERS. More CARS PULL UP.

EXLEY
Shit... Come on.

Exley starts for his car, but Bud holds him back.

BUD
Too late.

A beat. Resigned, Exley nods. They retreat back to Room 6, disappear inside. A beat. There's MOVEMENT in the shadows to the left. To the right.


INT. VICTORY MOTEL - ROOM 6 - NIGHT

There's a big back window. Bud covers most of it with a ratty old mattress. He pumps the shotgun.

He pulls a .45 automatic from his waistband.

BUD
Here.

He throws the auto to Exley, pulls out a .38. Bud's armed for bear.

EXLEY

You figured this was a set-up?
And you showed up anyway?

BUD
 
A lot of bad stuff happened here.
It's as good a place as any for it
to end.

Bud switches off the light.	They wait in silence.	Then:

EXLEY

You know, all I ever wanted was to
measure up to my father.

BUD
(softly)
I spent years trying not to live
down to mine.
(MORE)

BUD (CONT'D)

(thinking)
We should block off the bathroom.

They could come through --

A CREAK outside the front door. Bud levels the SHOTGUN. BOOM! The DOOR is BLOWN OFF ITS HINGES. We see the figure of a man sprawl back in the dirt. In the darkness beyond, MUZZLE FLASHES from all around. Exley and Bud RETURN FIRE.

We hear the BACK WINDOW BREAK under a MUFFLED BLOW. Bud charges back, yanks down the mattress revealing two men climbing through. Sitting ducks: torn apart by THREE TRIPLE-AUGHT ROUNDS close in. A beat, then...

EXLEY
We got him!

Bud smiles, in on the plan as theres an answering WHOOP. A third man looks through the window. BOOM! Bud nails him.

Bud motions Exley to stay put, then slips out the window.


EXT. VICTORY MOTEL - NIGHT

Bud crouches, looks between the cinder blocks supporting the room. Two sets of feet shuffling along. Bud FIRES the SHOTGUN. Shrieks as the men go down. Bud extends the .38 to fire point blank headshots. Then...

Bud flattens himself as a wicked CROSSFIRE TEARS UP ROOM 6.


INT. VICTORY MOTEL - NIGHT

Exley is forced down as well, lying flat as plaster rains down.

The door frame splinters as more Dudley men charge in. Four men with rifles. One is Patchett's Burly Bodyguard. They spot Exley lying there. Hushed whispers as they
 
approach: "Dead meat." "Be careful." Kicks in the side. The men look at each other, sneer.

Exley jerks a foot. The foot man stumbles as Exley spins around SHOOTING. FIRING the .45 and his own .38. All four men go down. Exley stands, digs into his pocket to reload.

Bud scrambles back through the window. Exley looks over and smiles as Bud reloads the shotgun. It's dead quiet.

EXLEY

I'm thinking we might walk away
from this.

At that instant, Dudley steps through the bathroom door. He's got Exley dead to rights. As he squeezes the trigger, Bud leaps forward, pushes Exley hard to the ground.

The SHOT passes through Bud's back by his left shoulder blade. It spins him around. A SECOND SHOT to the stomach slows him to a walk as he charges Dudley. A THIRD ROUND SHATTERS Bud's jaw, but still he comes. Driven by rage, his hands reaching for Dudley's throat. He even gets hold before a FOURTH SLUG tears his chest.

Bud falls hard.

Dudley swings his aim to Exley who's just managed to shake the cobwebs of being flattened by Bud. A frozen moment.

DUDLEY

I'm loathe to kill my brother
officers, Edmund.

EXLEY
Tell that to Jack Vincennes.	To
Stensland.

DUDLEY

Jack was a shame, but Dick
Stensland had the audacity to try
to sell me my own heroin.	Through
his whore girl friend.	I sent him
to make the buy.	The rest is

history.

EXLEY
Why?

DUDLEY
A vacuum, Edmund.	That's what we
have in Los Angeles.	Sending
Mickey Cohen up created it.	My
containment work maintained it.

Certain photographs guarantee it.
Organized crime has been held
back, but there's still a demand
for the services it provides.
 
EXLEY

And now you'll provide them.

DUDLEY
Absolutely.	Prostitution and
gambling are victimless crimes.

The heroin we'll run down to the
coloreds.	Anesthetize them.	As
long as it's not a middle class
problem, no one will care.	It's
still a crime free city... for

respectable people.

Dudley aims the .38, cocks back the hammer. We hear DISTANT POLICE SIRENS.

DUDLEY
This isn't politics, Edmund.

There won't be winners and losers
when it's over...

Dudley doesn't see Bud stir, reach into a pocket.

DUDLEY
Just the living and the dead.
It's always been that way in the

Bureau.	You should've realized
that before you became a
detective.

It's over. Dudley's finger tightens on the trigger. But Dudley screams as Bud buries a switchblade into his left calf. It took all Bud had left. As he collapses...

Dudley wails; Exley dives for Bud's shotgun. Dudley FIRES, misses. A wild SHOTGUN BLAST takes out half the wall. Dudley stumbles out the door. SIRENS BLARE.


EXT. VICTORY MOTEL - NIGHT

Dudley drops his gun as the cruisers stream down. Exley steps out behind him, but doesn't drop the shotgun. The two of them are bleached white by headlights.

Dudley raises his badge over his head.

DUDLEY

We're policemen!
(winks)
Let me do the talking.	They'll

make you Chief of Detectives.

Exley steps ahead to block his way.

EXLEY

No.

DUDLEY
Why not, lad?	Absolute justice?
 
EXLEY

Something like that.

DUDLEY
Really?	Would you be willing to
rig crime scene evidence to

support a prosecuting attorney's
working hypothesis?

Exley doesn't answer.	Dudley smiles.

DUDLEY
Would you be willing to beat
confessions out of suspects you
knew to be guilty?

Exley glares. Laughing, Dudley brushes by, limps toward the gathering policemen.

DUDLEY
Are you willing to shoot hardened
criminals in the back to offset
the chance they'll --

The SHOTGUN BELCHES flame. Dudley goes down, shot in the back. Exley drops the gun, raises his hands over his head.

LOEW

LOS ANGELES EXAMINER HEADLINE:

R.I.P. DUDLEY SMITH

Fabled L.A. Cop Dies Defending City

INT. LAPD HEADQUARTERS - BRIEFING ROOM - DAY

Exley in his dress blue uniform. The Chief smiles, pins gold stars to his shoulders.

CHIEF

Captain Edmund Exley.	Chief of
Detectives.	Los Angeles Police
Department.

Applause. Flashbulbs. Lynn watches from the back as Exley runs a handshake gauntlet. Finally, he spots her. She's returned to her natural brunette. Looks even better. Exley steps over.

EXLEY

(ironic smile)
I tried to throw it all away and
they give it back in spades.


EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

Exley walks Lynn out.

EXLEY

Where will you go?

LYNN

Bisbee, Arizona.	The air's good
for pensioners and I know where

everything is.

EXLEY

When?

LYNN
Right now, before I back down.

EXLEY
Where is he?

Lynn gestures ahead.	They walk to her car.	She opens
 
the back door. Bud's in the back. Braces on his legs, head sutured. Jaw wired shut and tubes running in and out. But his hands still look strong. Bud forces a smile through the wires, tries to say something, but can't.

EXLEY

Thanks for the push.

Exley takes his hand.	Bud squeezes till both men wince.

EXLEY

You just did what you did.	No
rank, no glory.

Exley slips his Medal of Valor into Bud's hand.

EXLEY
From me to you.	It'll mean

something if it's yours.

Bud takes it, turns away so Exley won't see the tears.

LYNN

We should go now.

As Exley steps back, Lynn closes the door. PARTY noises drift from upstairs. Exley looks to Lynn.

EXLEY
Do you think I ever could've been
in the running?

LYNN

Some men get the world.	Others
get ex-hookers and a trip to
Arizona.

A beat.	Exley wishes he'd gotten the trip to Arizona.

She kisses him on the cheek, gets in the CAR.	STARTS it.

Exley looks back at Bud. Bud presses his hands to the glass. Exley touches his side, palms half the man's size. Hands against hands.

The car moves. A turn into traffic, a good-bye TOOT on the HORN. Exley's all alone. As he watches them go...

FADE TO BLACK.
