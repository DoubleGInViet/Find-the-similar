INT. MOTEL. CALIFORNIA. EARLY MORNING.

One of those anonymous trucker motels along-side I-5 through central California. It’s late summer, 2002. Two women sleep together in a bed. Christine, aka Lady Bird, 17 years old. Her Mom, Marion, the age of Lady Bird’s Mom. A modern-day romantic Mary Cassatt rip-off painting of motherhood.

LADY BIRD (V.O.)
Do you think I look like I’m from
Sacramento?

CUT TO:

Now they’re awake. Lady Bird stares at her re. Marion makes the bed.

MARION

You are from Sacramento.

LADY BIRD
(re: making the bed)

You don’t have to do that.

MARION

Well it’s nice to make things neat and clean.

Marion is making hospital corners. Lady Bird sits on the just made bed. Marion sits beside her, moves the hair out of Lady Bird’s eyes.

MARION (CONT’D)

Ready to go home?

LADY BIRD

Ready.

INT. 1994 TOYOTA COROLLA. CALIFORNIA. DAY.

The last sentences of The Grapes of Wrath.

AUDIOBOOK

“Her hand moved behind his head and supported it. Her fingers moved gently in his hair. She looked up and across the barn, and her lips came together and smiled mysteriously.” You have been listening to ‘The Grapes of Wrath’ by John Steinbeck. If you...

(pause)
 
2.



Lady Bird ejects the tape, returns it to the case from the public library. They are both crying.

LADY BIRD
(looking on the back)

Our college trip took 21 hours and 5 minutes.

They laugh and then wipe their tears. It’s a nice moment - they both had the same emotion. Lady Bird immediately starts looking for a good song on the radio.

MARION
(turning it off)
Hey, you know, let’s just
sit with what we heard?

LADY BIRD
(bristling)

Are you serious?

MARION
We don’t need to be constantly

entertaining ourselves, do we?

Lady Bird stares out the window, now sullen. Then:

LADY BIRD
I wish I could live through

something.

MARION

Aren’t you?

LADY BIRD

Nope. The only exciting thing about 2002 is that it’s a palindrome.

MARION

Ok fine, yours is the worst life of all, you win.
 

LADY BIRD

Oh so now you’re mad? Because I wanted to listen to music?
 


MARION

It’s just that you’re being ridiculous, you have a great life.

 

LADY BIRD

I’m sorry I’m not perfect.

MARION
Nobody is asking you to be perfect!

Just considerate would do.
 
3.



LADY BIRD
(really picking a fight)
I don’t even want to go to school
in	this	state	anyway,	I	hate
California. I  want  to  go  to  the

East Coast.

MARION

Your Dad and I will barely be able to afford in-state tuition.

LADY BIRD

There are loans, scholarships!

MARION
Your brother, your very smart
brother, can’t even find a job --

LADY BIRD

He and Shelly work. They have jobs.

MARION

THEY BAG AT THE GROCERY STORE.

That is not a career and they went
to BERKELEY.MARION
Your father’s company is laying people off right and left, did you know that? No of course not because you don’t care about anyone but yourself.

MARION
Immaculate Heart is already a

luxury.

LADY BIRD
Immaculate FART. You wanted that,
not me!

MARION

Miguel saw someone knifed in front of him at Sac High, is that what you want? You’re telling me that you want to see someone knifed right in front of you?
 
4.



LADY BIRD
He barely saw that. I want to go

where culture is, like New York.
 

MARION

How in the world did I raise such a SNOB?

MARION
 


LADY BIRD

Or at least Connecticut or New Hampshire. Where writers live in the woods.

 

You couldn’t get into those schools anyway.

LADY BIRD

MOM!

MARION
You can’t even pass your driver’s
test.

LADY BIRD
Because you wouldn’t let me
practice enough!

MARION

The way you work, the way you don’t work, you’re not even worth state tuition, Christine.

LADY BIRD	MARION (CONT'D)
MY NAME IS LADY BIRD!	Well actually, it’s not, and
	it’s ridiculous. Your name
	is Christine.
LADY BIRD	

CALL ME LADY BIRD LIKE YOU SAID YOU WOULD!

MARION

You should just go to City College, with your work ethic. City College and then to jail then back to City College. Maybe you’d learn how to pull yourself up and not expect everyone to do everything for you...

They slow for a stop light and Lady Bird dramatically opens the door and rolls out of the car. Marion screams.
 
5.



INT. IMMACULATE HEART OF MARY. DAY.

Close on a cast. In very small letters is written “fuck you, mom.” The cast belongs to Lady Bird. She follows along with the mass.

CREDITS run over this joint liturgy between Immaculate Heart of Mary (girls school) and Xavier (boys school) and beginning of the year activities.

A sea of catholic girls’ school uniforms in bleachers during candidate speeches.

CANDIDATE
(finishing her speech)
A Vote for Amanda is a vote for
boys. Boys and healthy vending
machines because no one wants a

muffin with that many calories.

Lady Bird waits her turn to make her speech, and makes eye contact with Julie in the crowd, a sweet, chubby 17 year old. Her best friend.

5 classrooms, 5 syllabi, 5 “beginning of senior year” speeches from the teachers. A few teachers are nuns.

SISTER SARAH-JOAN There are the classics: St. Augustine, of course, and Aquinas. My favorite, Kierkegaard - wait until you hear his love story - it will make you swoon.

Back in the church, Lady Bird looks intently at an image of Jesus. The priest gives his homily.
PRIEST
We’re afraid we won’t get into the college of our choice, we’re afraid we won’t be loved, we won’t be liked, we won’t succeed.

Everyone takes communion. Lady Bird approaches and crosses her arms so she just gets a blessing, not real communion, she’s not Catholic. Lady Bird watches the boys get communion. It’s somehow sexy, opening their mouths to receive the wafer.

SISTER SARAH-JOAN (V.O.) Some of the students were disturbed by your posters.
 
6.



INT. VICE-PRINCIPAL SISTER SARAH-JOAN’S OFFICE. DAY.

Sister Sarah-Joan, in a traditional habit, holds up some of Lady Bird’s campaign materials.

LADY BIRD
It’s just a bird head on a lady

body or vice versa.

SISTER SARAH-JOAN

I think it’s a little upsetting...

Reveal of the poster: Lady Bird’s head on a bird body.

Another shows her Catholic-uniformed body with a bird head.

LADY BIRD
It’s my tradition to run for

office. Don’t worry, I won’t win.

SISTER SARAH-JOAN

That’s not what I’m worried about.

LADY BIRD
(worried)
This won’t mess with my
scholarship, will it?

SISTER SARAH-JOAN
No, you’re okay there.
(trying to be helpful)
You have a performative streak, I
think.

LADY BIRD

I think that too.

SISTER SARAH-JOAN
Maybe you’d enjoy theatre arts...
They are having auditions for the
fall musical.

LADY BIRD

Do we have that here?

SISTER SARAH-JOAN
It’s a collaborative effort with
the men at Xavier.

LADY BIRD
How am I a senior and not know we

have that?
 
7.



SISTER SARAH-JOAN Perhaps you haven’t always been an active part of this community.

SISTER SARAH-JOAN

They do a fall musical and a spring play and from what I hear it’s a real blast.

LADY BIRD
What I’d really like is to be on

Math Olympiad.

SISTER SARAH-JOAN
(gently)
But math isn’t something that you
are terribly strong in?

LADY BIRD

That we know of YET.

CLOSE ON A LIST.

Sign ups for auditions for the fall musical. A hand reaches up and takes the pen attached and writes, in all caps:

CHRISTINE “LADY BIRD” McPHERSON

And then another hand reaches up and writes:

JULIANNE “JULIE” PICKETT

LADY BIRD (O.S.)
“Julie” doesn’t need to be in

quotes.

JULIE (O.S.)

But it’s not my real name.

Reveal Julie and Lady Bird debating this:

LADY BIRD

It’s not the same thing.

JULIE
(shaking her head)
I’m not sure you’re right...
 
8.



EXT. SACRAMENTO STREETS. LATE AFTERNOON.

Julie and Lady Bird walk through the “fancy” neighborhood, “The Fabulous Forties.” They stop in front of this very specific house - it is the Dream House: It is three stories and blue, with white shutters and a big American Flag. It looks like nothing bad would ever happen in this house.

JULIE

I love this neighborhood.

LADY BIRD

Yeah, it’s so beautiful.

JULIE

If I lived here I would definitely have my wedding in the backyard.
LADY BIRD

I’d have friends over all the time to study and eat snacks. I’d be like “MOM WE’RE TAKING THE SNACKS UPSTAIRS TO THE TV ROOM.”

JULIE

I’d have my own bathroom.

INT. GROCERY STORE. EARLY EVENING.

Julie and Lady Bird browse magazines in an empty checkout aisle. A Checker calls out to them:

CHECKER

I can’t stop you dicks from hanging out here but quit wrinkling all the magazines!

LADY BIRD
When I’m in this store, I’m not
your sister - I’m a customer,
Miguel! I’m always right!

This is Miguel. Lady Bird’s brother. 22, Latino, clearly adopted. Julie watches him and his girlfriend, Shelly Yuhan, 22, a Bagger:

JULIE
Ever since she moved in, your
brother and Shelly are becoming
the same person.

LADY BIRD

No way.
 
9.



Shelly and Miguel have the same asymmetrical hair-cut and “interesting” piercings. Vaguely punk looking. Seem like they’re wearing black leather jackets even when they aren’t.

LADY BIRD (CONT’D)

Yeah, okay, maybe.

JULIE
(re: magazine)
See, why I don’t look like that?

The girls look at a model in the magazine. She poses in front of the New York City skyline.

LADY BIRD
Just once I’d like to have the
song “New York Groove” play and
feel like it really applies to
my life.

JULIE

You’ve never even been to New York.

LADY BIRD

That’s why I’m applying to New York colleges - do you know if Sarah Lawrence is actually IN the city?

JULIE

Your parents would pay for that?

LADY BIRD
Scholarships, financial aid. I’ll
figure it out. My Mom thinks I
can’t get in but she is sorely
mistaken.

JULIE

What about terrorism?

LADY BIRD

Don’t be a Republican.

JULIE
I’m probably just going to go to

City College.

MIGUEL
(almost yelling)
PUT THE MAGAZINE BACK.SHIT.

INT. PSYCH HOSPITAL. EARLY MORNING.

Marion yawns. Luis, a large Filipino man, approaches her:
 
10.



LUIS

You doing okay, mama?

MARION
Yes, but that was terrifying
wasn’t it? Thank god you were
there. I guess I can’t have
pencils anymore.

LUIS
Yeah, gotta go back to just felt

tip markers. Crayola.

Marion suddenly remembers she has something, she hand Luis a small bag:

MARION

Oh Luis this is for you! I got it for the baby, I couldn’t resist it.

He pulls out a frilly pink dress for a toddler.

LUIS

She loves pink!

MARION

Well, it’s really more for you and Andrea than it is for the baby, and I’m sorry I didn’t have time to wrap it....

LUIS

No, it’s perfect.

MARION

See you tomorrow... I mean, later?

Luis just laughs.

INT. 1994 TOYOTA COROLLA. EARLY MORNING.

Marion drives back home. It is romantic somehow. She loves these streets, loves the turns she knows so well. When she’s not resenting the stuck-ness of her own life she has an enormous capacity to love it. Remember this moment with Marion.

EXT. LADY BIRD’S NEIGHBORHOOD. EARLY MORNING.

Marion drives up. Women are watering their lawns, getting the paper, doing yard work, touching their flowers. Solidly middle class. Marion waves to neighbors. They wave back. She picks up the mail, bills, papers, etc.
 
11.



INT. BATHROOM. MORNING.

Dad (50s, name: Larry) brushes his teeth. Marion perched on the edge of the tub with a newspaper and a stack of mail, going through it.

LARRY
Did you know toothpaste is
basically ineffective? It’s like
sucking on a mint.

MARION
(to Larry, shaking her
head)
Mike Kerry died. I didn’t know he
was sick again.

LARRY

How old was he?

MARION

Only fifty-six.

Knocking at the door.

MIGUEL (O.S.)

Can Shelly and I get in there?

MARION
In a minute honey Dad and I are

still in here!

LARRY
(re: Mike)

That’s too young.

MARION
(calling)
LADY BIRD YOU BETTER BE DRESSED!


LADY BIRD

I AM DRESSED.


MARION (CONT’D)
I’ll send them a note.
(a little softer)
Do you think that Shelly and Miguel have sex on the pullout couch?
 
12.



LARRY

Oh yeah.

Marion laughs at Larry’s subtle joke. He laughs at her laughter. They like each other.

INT. KITCHEN. MORNING.

Miguel and Shelly eat cereal. Larry reads the paper. Marion makes Lady Bird’s breakfast and her lunch.

LADY BIRD

Why can’t I just make the eggs?

MARION

Because you take too long and make a big mess and then I have to clean it up.

SHELLY
(small voice)
Eggs aren’t good for the
environment, anyway.

LADY BIRD
(too loud)

WHAT?

MIGUEL

You heard her.

MARION
(placing the eggs)

Here, eat quickly, PLEASE.

LARRY
(re: paper)
Look at all these pictures. Every
newspaper looks like USA Today.

MIGUEL
Shelly and I are trying to be
vegan. Hence the soy milk.

LADY BIRD

You wear leather jackets.
 
13.



SHELLY

They’re vintage. It doesn’t support the industry.

LADY BIRD
(poking at the eggs)
They aren’t done, there’s white
stuff.


SHELLY
You know how you love Brambles?

Pigs are smarter than him even.

LADY BIRD
I never thought Brambles was a

GENIUS okay?


LADY BIRD (CONT’D)
(very obnoxious)
MOM! The eggs are NOT DONE!

MARION

FINE MAKE YOUR OWN FUCKING EGGS.

Marion then throws the frying pan violently in the sink and retreats to the bathroom. The noisy hair-dryer starts up.

LADY BIRD

I WANTED TO YOU WON’T LET ME!

Lady Bird follows Marion out of the room.

SHELLY

Your sister doesn’t like me.

LADY BIRD (O.S.)

MOM!!! I’M HUNGRY!


MIGUEL

She does.

Shelly gets up, pouting. MIGUEL follows her


MARION (O.S.)
YOU HAD YOUR CHANCE!
GOING TO BED!
 
14.


Larry is left alone. It’s weirdly peaceful for half a second.

INT. 1994 TOYOTA COROLLA. DAY.

Lady Bird and Larry on the way to school. She feverishly changes the radio station, finds a song she likes:

LADY BIRD

Did you know that Alanis Morisette wrote this song in only ten minutes?

LARRY

I believe it.

LADY BIRD
(she smiles)
So I’m applying to a couple East
Coast schools. I need you to help
me with the financial aid

application but Mom can’t know.

LARRY
We... aren’t they quite

expensive?

LADY BIRD
First, yes that’s why financial
aid. Second, I have to get in
first.

LARRY

Mom won’t be happy about it.

LADY BIRD

Which is why I don’t want to fight about it before I have to.
 
15.



Lady Bird looks up. They are a couple of blocks from school.

LADY BIRD (CONT’D)

Just pull over here

LARRY
Are you sure, I can drive you to
the front --

LADY BIRD
No, just this is fine. I like to

walk.

LARRY

Okay, well, I love you.

LADY BIRD
So what do you think? About
college?

LARRY

I’ll see what I can do.

LADY BIRD
(kisses him on the cheek)
Thanks Dad, love you too. Have a
good day at work.

LARRY
Hey, I’m like Keith Richards “I’m
just happy to be anywhere.”

She gets out quickly and hurries away. She’s almost at school when Julie pulls up.

JULIE
(calling out)
Hey bitch!

Ms. Pickett has VERY LARGE fake breasts. Her boyfriend, Matt, hands a sack lunch to Lady Bird and Julie.

MATT
Alright girls, hope you like

pickles.
 
16.



JULIE

Thanks, Uncle Matt.

LADY BIRD

Sweet!

Ms. Pickett gets in the driver’s seat, they drive away.

LADY BIRD

He’s not your uncle.

JULIE
It’s something I’m trying out.

Bye, mom.

(watching Ms. Pickett go)

Your Mom really likes you.

JULIE

Yeah. I just keep getting
fatter.

Lady Bird starts eating the Matt lunch and chucks her own lunch into a garbage can. The one her Mom spent time making.

LADY BIRD (CONT’D)
(mouth full)

Me too. Matt is awesome.

JULIE

Yeah, I hope he marries my Mom. That would be nice. He promised me his old car when I turn eighteen.

In the student parking lot, a girl gets out of her fancy Range Rover. She’s pretty in a high school way.

LADY BIRD
That car should be illegal. Jenna
Walton’s not doing any off-roading.
She just goes to Pavillions.

JULIE

I heard Jenna Walton has a tanning bed in her house.

The girl, Jenna Walton, is very tan. Identical tan girls descend on her.

LADY BIRD

She is so pretty.

JULIE

Her skin is luminous.

LADY BIRD

Maybe we should try tanning.
 
17.



INT. VESTMENT ROOM. DAY

Lady Bird and Julie sit with their legs up the wall, eating communion wafers out of a large plastic container.

LADY BIRD
Yeah, in the tub I just scoot
myself under like now, like this,
and then the water just...

She gestures, showing that the water would flow into her crotch and get her off. They are hysterically laughing.

JULIE

We are so gross!

LADY BIRD

I think I figured it out when I was like three or something.

JULIE

I use, I take off the shower head, oh god this is so embarrassing! I use that.

LADY BIRD

I don’t know if mine is the right kind, though. Maybe it’s different when you actually have a penis in there, like it’s more intense.

JULIE

Mine is pretty intense, I think.

Darlene, an odd looking girl, has silently walked in.

DARLENE
You’re not supposed to eat the
wafers!

JULIE
(trying to be helpful)

They aren’t consecrated.

Darlene turns on her heel, annoyed. Lady Bird and Julie dissolve into giggles.

INT. XAVIER MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM/THEATRE. DAY.

Lady Bird, wearing an extreme “audition” dress, and Julie, in her uniform, sit and watch other students perform.
 
18.



Father Leviatch runs auditions - there is something funny and depressed about him. An overweight woman, Miss Patty, accompanies on the piano when needed.

A boy, Greg, is up. He has a big voice for such a tiny boy:

GREG

“BEING ALIVVEEEEEEEEEE......!”

Cut to Father Leviatch calling out from his clipboard:

FATHER LEVIATCH

Okay, Christine?

LADY BIRD

Lady Bird.

FATHER LEVIATCH

Is that your given name?

LADY BIRD

Yes.

FATHER LEVIATCH

Why is it in quotes?

LADY BIRD
Well I gave it to myself. It’s
given. To me, by me.

FATHER LEVIATCH

OK, take it away, Lady Bird.

Cut to Lady Bird singing her song.

LADY BIRD
“Everybody says don’t / Everybody
says don’t / Everybody says don’t
it isn’t right, don’t it isn’t
niiiiiceeee / Everybody says don’t

/	Everybody says don’t / Everybody says don’t walk on the grass....”

Cut to Julie, wearing her uniform, shy and nervous:

JULIE
(singing)

“Make me a channel of your peace / where there’s despair in life let me bring hope / where there is darkness only light / and where there’s sadness ever joy....”

Julie has a sweet, clear, beautiful voice. It’s a quiet moment and everyone pays attention.
 
19.



More girls and more boys. Now most everyone is done.

Danny stands. He’s very handsome. Strapping, even. He gives his sheet music to the Miss Patty. Then he sings:

DANNY
(singing)

“There are giants in the sky! / There are big tall terrible giants in the sky! When you’re way up high and you look below at the world you’ve left and the things you know little than a glance is enough to show you just how small you are!”

He’s AMAZING. Julie and Lady Bird look at each other. DREAM BOAT CITY.

INT. LADY BIRD’S ROOM. NIGHT.

Underneath her window sill by her bed, Lady Bird writes the name:

DANNY.

She’s in love and want to make it permanent somewhere.

Suddenly, a voice is directed right at Lady Bird’s door:

MARION (O.S.)
I CAN SEE THE LIGHT ON IN YOUR ROOM
GO TO BED!

Lady Bird shuts off her light and sleeps, dreaming of Danny.

EXT. XAVIER MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM/THEATRE. DAY

Lady Bird and Julie check the casting list. They first find:

MERRILY WE ROLL ALONG

Franklin Shepard: Danny O’Neill, Charlie Kringus: Greg Anrue

Gussie: Diana Greenway, Beth: Julie Steffans.

They move way down the list until they find:

Swing/Chorus: Christine McPherson

LADY BIRD
(tightly)
Congratulations.

JULIE

You too! We both got in!
 
20.



LADY BIRD

Everyone who auditioned got in. The part I got was basically not getting in.

JULIE
(trying to downplay)
I do not even know how I got cast
in my part.

LADY BIRD

Me neither. I was the one who had a dress and prepared a song.

JULIE

I know!

LADY BIRD
(thinking)
Now you’re going to get romantic
with Danny on stage.

JULIE

It’s probably my only shot at that, you know?

LADY BIRD

She take the pen and crosses out Christine and writes LADY BIRD. Leaves.

Julie stays and when she’s sure she’s alone she touches her name - loving herself and the feeling of being chosen.

INT. GROCERY STORE. EARLY EVENING.

Marion grocery shops. Lady Bird looks at a BRIDE magazine.

LADY BIRD

Mom...

MARION

(re: the magazine)
We don’t need to buy that.

LADY BIRD

It’s only three dollars. I’m having a hard week.

MARION

If you want to read it we can go to the public library.

LADY BIRD

I want to read it in bed.
 
21.


MARION
That’s something rich people do.

We are not rich people.

Lady Bird walks away and then tucks the magazine underneath her sweater into the top of her skirt, sneakily stealing it.

As she’s performing this maneuver, she sees DANNY (!) and his

Mom and three little brothers walk by. She walks up bravely:

LADY BIRD

Hey!

DANNY

Hi.

LADY BIRD

Come here often?

DANNY
(not getting the joke)

Excuse me?

LADY BIRD
(extending her hand)

I’m Lady Bird, we’re going to be in the musical together.

DANNY

Oh, yeah, I remember you! You were wearing that dress.

LADY BIRD
I just wanted to say what’s up and

I’ll see you in rehearsal.

DANNY

Thanks, I’m super excited. You live in the neighborhood?

LADY BIRD
(doing a voice)

Nah, I’m from the wrong side of the tracks.

DANNY

What?

LADY BIRD

Is that your family? There are so many of you!

DANNY
Irish-Catholic! It’s hard to find a

girl to date that’s not my cousin.
 
22.



LADY BIRD
(flustered)

Well, okay. You’re going to make a great Franklin.

DANNY
Thanks! I want my hair, his hair
to be curly, though.

LADY BIRD

Yeah!

DANNY

Like Jim Morrison. Very ’70s.

LADY BIRD

Like Jim Morrison exactly.

DANNY’S MOM

DANNY!

DANNY

Gotta go!


Lady Bird walks back to Marion, who is with Miguel while he scans their groceries and Shelly bags them.

LADY BIRD

Who is Jim Morrison again?

MIGUEL
He was in a rock band, moron, The

Doors.

LADY BIRD

I knew that.

MARION
(looking at the bill)
This is with your employee
discount?

MIGUEL

Yeah, it’s already included.

Marion looks worried.

INT. XAVIER MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM/THEATRE. AFTERNOON.

Everyone tries to keep up with the dance steps Miss Patty teaches them. She is also, apparently, the choreographer. She can move amazingly well for a bigger woman.
 
23.



They play theatre games and do acting exercises. Father Leviatch is actually quite good at casting a spell and making everyone feel included.

CUT TO:

The priest, Father Leviatch, looks around the stage where everyone sits, cross legged, tired from dancing.

FATHER LEVIATCH
To get our emotions going, we’re
going to play “first one to cry
wins.”

FATHER LEVIATCH

Starting ... Now. I’m playing too.
So is Miss Patty.

Miss Patty nods.

They all try to cry really hard. Suddenly everyone looks up - Father Leviatch is sobbing.

Everyone is uncomfortable watching an adult man cry.


FATHER LEVIATCH

I’m sorry… I’m sorry.

EXT. XAVIER MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM/THEATRE. AFTERNOON.

Diana, another girl in the play, dishes the gossip while she and Lady Bird and Danny wait for their rides:

DIANA

I heard that before he became a priest he was married and he had a son named Etienne who died of a drug overdose at 17 which was maybe a suicide but my mom says same difference if you are so careless with your life.
(a horn honks)

Oh that’s her! Gotta go, bye guys!

Lady Bird and Danny wave goodbye and then fall into a semi- awkward silence. She sees it’s her Moment. She tries to casually hand Danny a bag but it’s a kind of big bag.
 
24.



LADY BIRD

Oh, I almost forgot. I brought you these hot rollers. For your Jim Morrison hair.

He pulls out the Conair pink and purple “Hot Sticks.”

DANNY

Thank you so much.

LADY BIRD

You’re welcome.

DANNY
You’ll have to show me how to use

them.

LADY BIRD
(weirdly formal)
It would be my pleasure.

DANNY

They look like sperms.

He laughs and Lady Bird joins in. They do look like sperms but it wasn’t so funny to say it.

DANNY (CONT’D)
Hey! I just remembered I had a

dream about you!

LADY BIRD

Really?! What happened?

DANNY
We were flying to Disneyland on a

giant carrot....

LADY BIRD

Awesome!

DANNY

I love Disneyland.

LADY BIRD

Me too, I think it’s kind of scary but I also love it.

Triumph! They are having a Real Conversation.

INT. ALGEBRA II CLASS. DAY

Mr. Bruno explains a problem on a projector. He’s handsome and young-ish. Definitely handsome for an all girls school. Lady Bird zones out, thinking about Danny. Julie looks intently at Mr. Bruno. She loves him, privately.
 
25.



MR. BRUNO
(finishing an explanation)

Don’t leave me hanging. Can I get a nod? That’s good. Maybe even a verbal confirmation?

JULIE
(too loud)
YES.

Julie experience her mini moment of private embarrassment.

They are handed back quizzes. Julie gets a A-.

MR. BRUNO

Good job, Jules, I could tell from your work that you even understood the one you missed!

He kind of winks at her. She blushes.

LADY BIRD
(looking at her grade)

SUCK A DICK.

JULIE
(to Lady Bird)

I like “Jules.”

Lady Bird looks at her C+.

LADY BIRD
I just don’t get why I’m not good
at math, my Dad is really good at
math. Even Miguel has a math
degree.

JULIE

Maybe it’s your Mom’s fault.

INT. HOMECOMING DANCE. SCHOOL GYM. NIGHT.

There are a bunch of kids clumped, some dancing, some sitting on half-hearted hay bales. The popular girls, Jenna etc., wear tank tops that say (front) Ditch the horse... (and back) Ride the cowboy!

Lady Bird and Julie now have on bandanas and denim - they’re doing the Groucho Marx Duck Soup dance to “Tha Crossroads.” Suddenly Lady Bird stops.

JULIE

You lose! POINT JULIE!

LADY BIRD

No, look
 
26.

Across the dance, there is Danny. He’s wearing chaps, a holster, a hat, fake pistols. Like teenage John Wayne.

LADY BIRD (CONT’D)

Wish me luck.

JULIE

Luck.

Julie watches as Lady Bird makes a bee-line for Danny.

LADY BIRD

Wanna dance?

DANNY

Hell, yeah!

They start slow dancing together. Julie does the duck-soup dance alone and then stops. It’s pointless without a buddy. She falls back and watches.

Sister Sarah-Joan walks by Lady Bird and Danny:

SISTER SARAH-JOAN

Six inches for the Holy Spirit!

They roll their eyes: Rules! Once she leaves Danny pulls Lady Bird close again. She swoons. Life is happening.

EXT. SCHOOL GYM. NIGHT.

Lady Bird, Julie and Danny wait outside of the dance, leaning against the gym waiting for their parents. Julie’s Mom pulls up with Uncle Matt. Honks.

JULIE
(to Lady Bird)

That’s us!

LADY BIRD

Nah, my Mom is coming.

JULIE

No she’s not.

LADY BIRD
(pointed)
Yes, she is.

JULIE

But the plan was sleepover at -

LADY BIRD

IT’S FINE.
 
27.



Lady Bird is clearly trying to stay there with Danny.

JULIE
(annoyed)

Okay, bye then.

Julie gets in the front seat to practice driving. Leaves. Lady Bird and Danny are quiet, listening to the muffled sounds of the dance. Then:

DANNY
Have you ever been out of the

country?

LADY BIRD

When I was little, my Dad had a job that took him to Brazil. I remember from the pictures.

DANNY
I’ve never been out of the
country. It’s my dream to go
to Paris.

LADY BIRD

(sighs)
Paris.

DANNY

That’s why I’m learning French.

LADY BIRD

My mom said French wasn’t useful.

DANNY

It is if you want to go to Paris.

They laugh.

DANNY (CONT’D)

I still don’t know how to use those rollers you gave me.

LADY BIRD
Oh, it’s so easy, like after they
heat up, you just take your hair
and twist the hair and then twirl
the thing like this...

She reaches up to his hair. He kisses her. It’s surprising.

They kiss again. It’s romantic, really romantic.

EXT. SACRAMENTO STREETS. NIGHT.

Lady Bird walks home. She’s smiling so huge and throws her face to the sky and screams.

INT. HOUSE. NIGHT.
 
28.


Marion and Larry are arguing with a lot of financial documents strewn across the kitchen table.
 
29.



MARION

Larry how long will this hold us.

LARRY

I don’t know...

Lady Bird opens the back door, glowing and shiny from the night and the kiss. She sneaks past.

MARION
Well, someone must know. Can the
whole family go on Cobra, even
Miguel? What happens if someone
gets in an accident?

LARRY
I’m not sure - the severance
package I think it expires all at
once, not within the calendar
year...

Lady Bird tip-toes into her room. She knows she wasn’t supposed to see this. And she doesn’t want to know any more.

MARION

I’ll ask at my work if --

Suddenly, a noise makes her turn her head sharply.

MARION (CONT’D)

Is she home?

LARRY

Maybe leave it for tonight...

MARION
No, she knows better.
(getting up)
She cannot sneak around like
this...

Marion barrels down the hallway towards Lady Bird’s room.

INT. BEDROOM. NIGHT.

Lady-Bird, under the covers, hears her Mom coming. Then all the lights come on, it’s so bright:

MARION
Christine! You can’t leave your

room like this!

LADY BIRD

I didn’t...
 
30.


MARION
None of these things were put
away right, they aren’t nice,
CHRISTINE! NOW!

LADY BIRD
(weakly)
My name is Lady Bird.

MARION

Don’t lie to me, Christine!

Lady Bird sees her Dad pass by the door and give her a look like “I’m sorry, I can’t help you here.” He disappears. Marion picks up her uniform.

MARION
NO, this uniform is going to look
like TRASH on Monday!

MARION (CONT’D)
This isn’t right - we can’t treat
our clothes like this. I don’t
know what your wealthy friends
do...

LADY BIRD
Why do you care what I do to my

clothes?

Marion closes the door..

MARION

Your father does not have a job.

MARION
He lost his job, okay? Do you
need him to come in here and

explain that to you?
 
30.



MARION

Of course he wouldn’t do it anyway, he’s Mr. Nice Guy. I always have to be the Bad Guy.

LADY BIRD
Can we please talk about this

tomorrow?

MARION

You can’t look like a rag because that makes us look like rags. And you want to know the truth? Here’s the truth: some of your friends’ fathers could employ your father and they won’t do that if it looks like his family is trash.

Lady Bird puts all her clothes away while Marion watches.

LADY BIRD
(quietly)

Didn’t you ever go to sleep without putting all your clothes away perfectly? Like even once? And don’t you wish your Mom hadn’t gotten angry?

MARION

My mother was an abusive alcoholic.

Lady Bird has nothing to say to this, Marion wins.

INT. GUIDANCE COUNSELOR’S OFFICE. DAY.

Lady Bird looks at some brochures. The Guidance Counselor looks at her grades and test scores.

GUIDANCE COUNSELOR
So I understand that you’re not
interested in any Catholic
colleges?

LADY BIRD

No way. Sorry, but yes, no way.
 
31.



GUIDANCE COUNSELOR
Then you’ll be applying to UCs and

State schools?

LADY BIRD
Yes, but also those East Coast
liberal arts schools. Like Yale,
but not Yale because I probably
couldn’t get in.

GUIDANCE COUNSELOR
(laughs)
You definitely couldn’t get in.
Part of my job is to help you be
realistic.

LADY BIRD

That seems like everyone’s job.

GUIDANCE COUNSELOR
Your SAT scores are strangely very

good.

Lady Bird shrugs.

GUIDANCE COUNSELOR (CONT’D) I’d placed some calls to local alumni of the schools you’re interested in, but unfortunately all the interviews are taken.

LADY BIRD

So... what does that mean?

GUIDANCE COUNSELOR

It means that you’ll have to get in on how you look on paper.

INT. THEATRE. DAY.

The kids rehearse -- following dance moves and singing.

EXT. ROSE GARDEN. NIGHT.

Lady Bird and Danny lie on a blanket in the park, looking up at the stars.

DANNY

Shouldn’t we go home?


LADY BIRD
(shakes her head)

My Mom is always mad. It doesn’t matter if I get home late, she’d be mad at me anyway.

DANNY
 
32.



Your Mom is hard on you.

LADY BIRD
(defensively)
She loves me a lot.
(then)
Pick a star for us.

DANNY
(pointing)

That one, right there right next to the bright one and then the dim one - see it?

LADY BIRD

That’s our star.

LADY BIRD (CONT’D)
(whispering)
You know you can touch my boobs,
right?

DANNY
I know... it’s just.... I respect
you too much for that.

LADY BIRD
Oh, cool, awesome. I totally get
that. Thank you.

DANNY

You're welcome.
 
33.



LADY BIRD
If you had boobs I wouldn’t touch

them either.

DANNY
I respect you so much because...

I love you.

LADY BIRD

I love you, too.

They kiss and look back up at the stars.

DANNY

Let’s name our star Claude.

Lady Bird makes a face.

LADY BIRD
That’s pretentious, don’t you

think?

DANNY
It’s French.
(then)
What should we name it?

LADY BIRD

BRUCE.

They laugh and kiss and yell to the heavens.

DANNY

I LOVE YOU!

LADY BIRD

I LOVE YOU!

They hug and are the happiest they’ve ever been, looking up at the sky and loving each other.
 
34.



LADY BIRD (CONT’D)
(whispers)

Bruce.

EXT. HALLWAYS OF IMMACULATE HEART OF MARY. DAY.

Julie and Lady Bird wander the hallways. Julie shoves a cupcake in her mouth, so does Lady Bird. The wander and chew contemplatively.

LADY BIRD
(not really to anyone)
It’s normal to not touch a penis.

JULIE
(looks around, notices
everyone is gone)
I have to go to class.

LADY BIRD

But I have free period!

JULIE

I need to pass history!

LADY BIRD
I think we’re done with the

learning portion of high school.

JULIE

I’m gonna go.

LADY	BIRD

NO! I HATE BEING ALONE!


JULIE
Bye, love you.

Julie takes off. Lady Bird lazily walks the halls.

She sees her empty math classroom and sees that Mr. Bruno isn’t there. She ducks inside. Notices his grade binder on the desk. Snatches it and then runs.

She dumps it into one of the big trash cans and hurries away.
 
35.



INT. THRIFT TOWN. DAY.

Marion and Lady Bird are looking through dresses.

MARION
Did Danny say whether his
grandmother has a formal
Thanksgiving?

LADY BIRD
I don’t know, there are a lot of
kids, but she lives in the fab
forties...

MARION
(nodding)
Your dad and I went to a dinner
party once in that neighborhood,
the CEO of ISC, and it was pretty

formal.

Lady Bird finds something - holds up a black dress.

MARION (CONT’D)

You’re not going to a funeral.

LADY BIRD

Well, I don’t know! What says “rich people Thanksgiving”?

They keep looking.

MARION

It’s just such a shame that you’re spending your last Thanksgiving with a family you’ve never met instead of us, but I guess you want it that way.
(clocks her walking)

Are you tired?

LADY BIRD

No.

A saleswoman, Joyce, calls out:

JOYCE SALESWOMAN

Hey Marion!

Marion waves to the saleswoman. Her voice is so warm and friendly with other people who are not her daughter:

MARION

Hey Joyce! How’s the baby!
