JOYCE SALESWOMAN

He’s crawling!

MARION

Ooohhh, I want to see a picture at checkout!
(back to Lady Bird)
If you’re tired we can sit down.

LADY BIRD

I’m not tired!

MARION

Oh it’s just that I couldn’t tell because you’re dragging your feet.
LADY BIRD

(silence)

MARION

Well, I just couldn’t tell.

LADY BIRD
Why didn’t you just say “Pick up
your feet.”

MARION

I didn’t know if you were tired.

LADY BIRD

You were being passive aggressive!

MARION

No. I wasn’t.

LADY BIRD

You are so INFURIATING.

MARION

Please stop yelling.

LADY BIRD

I’m not yelling.

Marion sees something. Holds it up. It’s a beautiful old fashioned looking dress. Marion has found the needle in the haystack.

LADY BIRD (CONT’D)

Oh it’s perfect!

MARION

Don’t you love it.
 
37.



INT. LADY BIRD’S HOUSE. LATE AT NIGHT.

Marion, still in her nurses uniform, sits at the sewing machine, tailoring the dress she and Lady Bird found. She finishes, and then hangs it up quietly in Lady Bird’s room. Doesn’t wake her up, simply watches her daughter sleep for a minute.

INT. ALGEBRA II CLASS. DAY.

Mr. Bruno addresses his class:

MR. Bruno

So because my gradebook has disappeared, I am going to count on you to reconstruct it. I know you all know your grades better than anybody. I have a general idea, but this is all about the honor code right now, okay?

They are going up one by one to talk through their grade and he can start again.

JULIE

A-

MR. Bruno

I’m pretty sure it was an A.

JULIE

Um, I’m not but okay...

MR. Bruno
It was – trust me, I know talent

when I see it.

JULIE

You’re welcome. No, thank you.

He does that wink thing at her again. She retreats, red faced. Lady Bird is next:

LADY BIRD

Hey, I think B.

MR. Bruno

I thought it was more like B- maybe even C+ territory.

LADY BIRD
No, because I did really well on
the last quiz...
 
38.



MR. Bruno
I seem to remember you doing only

slightly better.

LADY BIRD

It brought my average up to a B.

MR. Bruno

Okay, B it is. It’s your honor.

INT. LADY BIRD’S HOUSE. DAY.

Marion, Larry, Shelly and Miguel run around making sure the house is perfect for their Thanksgiving. The doorbell rings.

MIGUEL

LADY BIRD! YOUR LOVER AWAITS!

Marion opens the door, lets in Danny.

MARION
Hello, Danny! The famous Danny!
Aren’t you adorable!
(she	hugs	him)
Larry isn’t he adorable?

LARRY

He’s adorable.

MARION
And you’re driving her and

everything - Wow!

DANNY
Thank you for letting Lady Bird
come to my Grandmother’s
Thanksgiving, Mrs. McPherson.

MARION
No more politeness, just call me

Marion!

DANNY
(firmly shaking Larry’s
hand)
Nice to meet you, Mr. McPherson.

LARRY
Please, call me Mr. Larry

McPherson.
 
39.



MARION
(hits him)
Larry! Sit down Danny, can I get

you something to drink?

DANNY

Oh no, I’m fine.

MIGUEL
(waving)
Hi, I’m Miguel. The brother.
I think Lady Bird wants to make an entrance. She’s mad we don’t have a spiral staircase.

SHELLY
(quietly)
Shelly.

DANNY

What?

SHELLY

Is my name.

They’re quiet for a moment. Danny tries to converse:

DANNY

It’s funny, on my way here, I went over the train tracks --

MARION

You took H street?

DANNY

Right, and so just Lady Bird always says that she lives on the wrong side of the tracks, but I always thought that it was, like, a metaphor.

MARION

Ah.

DANNY

But there are actual train tracks.

Marion’s face contorts. This is painful.

Just then, Lady Bird enters, looking beautiful in her vintage dress. She holds a duffel bag.

MARION
(now upset with her)

What in the hell is in that duffel bag?
 
40.



LADY BIRD

Don’t worry about it, Jeez!

DANNY
My grandmother will love that

dress.

INT. DANNY’S GRANDMOTHER’S HOUSE. LATE AFTERNOON.

Thanksgiving. It is at the Dream House. From the beginning. The blue one with the white trim and the American Flag. Lady Bird cannot believe it.

LADY BIRD
Wait, this is your grandma’s
house? Oh my god.

She meets his Grandmother, almost kisses her hand like she’s a queen but pulls back just in time:

LADY BIRD

Your house is my favorite in all
of East Sacramento.

Lady Bird and Danny walk through the house. She spots very prominent Ronald Regan poster:

LADY BIRD (CONT’D)

Is this... a joke?

DANNY

No.

Lady Bird meets people, so many people, and in a lull, folds a napkin in a cool way - it looks like a four-pointed flower. Danny’s Grandmother notices, and IS TOTALLY INTO IT. Soon, Lady Bird is folding all the napkins at the tables this way, teaches her how to do it, too. It is clear how much Danny’s Grandmother enjoys Lady Bird.

INT. DANNY’S CAR. NIGHT

Lady Bird and Danny are singing along with songs from the show. Pick up Julie from her apartment complex. Pick up Greg from his house. Now they’re all singing.

In the car, they change out of their Thanksgiving “finery” and put on what they consider to be “people who listen to music in coffee shop” outfits. That was what the duffel was for, the costume change. There are scarves and a beret.

EXT. ALLEY BEHIND NEW HELVETIA COFFEE SHOP. NIGHT.

In their new outfits, Greg and Danny and Julie and Lady Bird smoke a out of a bowl, which another one of them lights.
 
41.

LADY BIRD
How do you know when it’s working?
 
42.



DANNY

You’ll know.

LADY BIRD

It’s not working.

GREG

It’s not? My sister said this was premium.

JULIE

I’m working.

DANNY

I’m working too.

LADY BIRD

Nope.

They are quiet for a second.

LADY BIRD (CONT’D)

I can’t feel my arms.

GREG

You’re working.

They laugh really hard. Danny makes out with Lady Bird.

INT. NEW HELVETIA COFFEE SHOP. NIGHT.

They hazily take stock of everything. There are some ironic turkeys pinned up on the stage.

The “cool kids” are there. They don’t say hi but they don’t shun them. Jenna Walton is there with her boyfriend, Jonah Ruiz. He’s singing pretty terrible songs about her with his band, the pretentiously named L’enfance Nue.

LADY BIRD
(whispered to Julie)

If Danny and I get married and then his Grandma died, I’d inherit the Dream House.

JULIE

Wouldn’t his parent’s get it?

LADY BIRD
(realizing)
Oh yeah, we’d have to kill them.
And kill his older brothers, too.
 
43.



Kyle Scheible, a long-haired beautiful bassist, is really into it. Lady Bird spends an extra-long time looking at this Kyle Scheible. She feels DEEPLY ATTRACTED to him. She looks at Danny, she loves him, yes, but there is something else going on with Kyle Scheible. She’s not sure, maybe it’s the pot. Maybe not. REMEMBER KYLE, Lady Bird will.

Meanwhile, Mr. Bruno is there - weird. He looks at Julie, who was looking at him. She turns quickly away.

JULIE
(to no one)
Where is Mr. Bruno’s wife...?

INT. LADY BIRD’S HOUSE. NIGHT.

Lady Bird and Danny stand by the microwave, making “Smart Ones” frozen dinners. Six of them. Greg and Julie also eat, everyone with their own spoon taking bites out of the different platters.

Then Marion walks in - they are still giggling, she awkwardly announces herself:

MARION

How’s it going?

No one can say anything, it’s almost like they’re frozen.

Finally Lady Bird is able to squeak out:

LADY BIRD

Mom, we really can’t talk right now.

They all dissolve into giggles again.

MARION

Well, Happy Thanksgiving. We missed you, Lady Bird.

Marion leaves. She’s hurt and angry but mostly hurt.

EXT. LADY BIRD’S FRONT YARD. NIGHT

The kids all pile back into Danny’s car. Lady Bird waves goodbye, all of them laughing. Then they are gone. Lady Bird shivers a little, now alone. Startles when she sees Shelly smoking:

LADY BIRD
(curious)
Why does that cigarette look so
weird? Like not like cigarette?
 
44.



Shelly offers her a drag. Lady Bird drags and coughs.

SHELLY
It’s a clove. Lick your lips.
That’s why they’re sweet.
(then)
Your Mom was really sad you weren’t here tonight for Thanksgiving.
LADY BIRD

Well, she hates me.

SHELLY

She has a big heart, your Mom. She took me in after my parents freaked out about, whatever, pre-marital sex. I admire her.

Lady Bird doesn’t fight Shelly.

INT. XAVIER. GIRLS DRESSING ROOM. EARLY EVENING. `

Buzzing in the girls dressing room. It’s opening night!

They are putting up pictures and do-dads. They are exchanging “opening night” gifts. The girls are applying too much makeup. There is music playing and lots of screaming.

INT. XAVIER. BOYS DRESSING ROOM. EARLY EVENING.

The boys also get ready. They are putting on powder and combing their hair. It’s less loud, but also kinetic.

INT. XAVIER MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM/THEATRE. BACKSTAGE. EARLY EVENING.

All the boys and girls are gathered in a circle. Father Leviatch and Miss Patty are leading the prayer.

FATHER LEVIATCH

SAINT IGNATIUS OF LOYOLA...

EVERYONE
(shouts)

PRAY FOR US!

DANNY

LIVE JESUS IN OUR HEARTS...
 
45.



EVERYONE

FOREVER!

They break and cheer. It’s time for the show.

INT. XAVIER MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM/THEATRE. NIGHT.

The show is about to begin. The audience sits in the dark. The students in the wings. The paltry orchestra strikes up the first chord.

MERRILY WE ROLL ALONG is actually a pretty upsetting and adult show. Julie sings a song about divorce. The other “fabulous” girl, Diana, plays a character who has an affair. There’s lots of pretend drinking of alcohol. They dance and sing their hearts out

Everyone cheers at the end, but more about the fact of the show as opposed to the show itself.

The audience includes the whole of Lady Bird’s family, Julie’s Mom and Uncle Matt, Danny’s whole Irish-Catholic clan. Everyone is proud.

INT. XAVIER MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM/THEATRE. NIGHT.

Mingling after the show. Some of the administrators look scandalized.

Julie sees Mr. Bruno and approaches him, feeling beautiful and confident:

MR. BRUNO

There she is! Jules, wow! You were so good. I couldn’t believe that.
JULIE

Thank you...

MR. BRUNO
Jules, I’d like you to meet my
wife, Becky. Becky this is Jules,
one of my brightest students.

BECKY

Nice to meet you.

JULIE
(devastated)
Nice to meet you, too.

MR. BRUNO

How we doing?
 
46.



BECKY

Yeah, I’m a little tired.

MR. BRUNO
Okay, I gotta get her home, we’ve
got the little one, but great
work Jules.

JULIE
(as they leave)
Congratulations.

Julie is humiliated, and doesn’t quite know why. She sits down next to Father Leviatch, who also looks traumatized. He watches people pass him by:

FATHER LEVIATCH

They didn’t understand it

INT. DINER. NIGHT.

The entire cast and crew is there, enjoying their opening night, eating a lot of chicken fingers and french fries. They are being silly and playing a Broadway trivia game. Lady Bird and Danny make towers with the sugar packets. Julie and Greg hang out together: they’re both the “extra” friends. Everyone is giddy and happy.

INT. DINER GIRLS BATHROOM. NIGHT.

Julie and Lady Bird wait for the stalls to open up.

LADY BIRD

HOW LONG DO YOU THINK YOU ALL WILL BE I DRANK SO MUCH SODA!

STALL WOMAN (O.S.)

Fuck you.

CHORUS MEMBER (O.S.)

I just got my period!

LADY BIRD

Goddamn it!

Lady Bird leaves.

JULIE

Where are you going?
 
47.



LADY BIRD
There’s never a line in the men’s

room!

INT. MEN’S ROOM. NIGHT.

Lady Bird opens the door and opens a stall and there, in front of her: Danny and Greg making out hard. Julie comes tumbling in from behind.

INT. JULIE’S ROOM. JULIE’S HOUSE. NIGHT.

They both cry. They listen to “Crash Into Me” by Dave Matthews and sob.

The song ends and Lady Bird starts it over.

INT. XAVIER MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM/THEATRE. NIGHT.

They perform the next night.

No fun. It’s no fun because their boyfriends are gay.

INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE. DAY.

Lady Bird gets her cast off with a saw. Marion watches.

The doctor throws the cast in the trash. She is mournful.

INT. ST. FRANCIS. DAY.

Finals. Lady Bird casually cheats off the girl sitting next to her.

INT. LIVING ROOM. CHRISTMAS DAY.

Everyone gets socks and underwear for Christmas. Even Shelly.

MARION

They’re really nice socks.

MARION

They’re expensive, actually. They wick moisture away from your feet.
SHELLY

Yeah my feet always have moisture.

LADY BIRD

Mom, I love them.
 
48.



MARION
(embarrassed)

I’m sorry it’s Small Christmas. We wanted to, well, it’s just a little small this year.

Larry opens his gift.

(laughing)
It’s just what I needed, honey.

He holds up a throw pillow that says “Golfers Don’t Diet They Just Exist On Greens.” He laughs.

MARION
(laughing, too)

It makes me laugh.

INT. LADY BIRD’S ROOM. NIGHT.

A gentle knock on the door.

LADY BIRD (O.S.)

Dad? Come in.

LARRY
(entering)
How did you know it was me?

LADY BIRD

Mom doesn’t knock.

LARRY
(laughs)

No, she doesn’t.

He gives her an envelope. Quietly says:

LARRY (CONT’D)
Here they are, your completed
financial aid applications. Merry
Christmas.

Lady Bird throws her arms around Larry.

LADY BIRD

Thank you! Thank you!

LARRY
Do you need money for the
applications? Because I can help
with that, too, I just need to --
 
49.



LADY BIRD

--	no, no, I’ve got that, summer jobs covered it.

INT. FAMILY/COMPUTER/MIGUEL’S ROOM. COMPUTER. DAY.

Lady Bird frantically fills out her applications: addresses things, puts materials in envelopes.

MIGUEL

This is why we have computer shut-off time - this is our room.

He indicates Shelly, looking forlorn by the pullout sofa-bed.

LADY BIRD
Okay, okay, just can you drive me
to the post office on J? It
should still be open.

EXT. POST OFFICE. NIGHT.

They are just closing up for the night. Lady Bird runs up and posts them at the last minute.

EXT. LADY BIRD’S HOUSE. PORCH. MIDNIGHT.

Lady Bird and her family are out celebrating New Years. Noise makers and sparklers. Happy 2003! Everyone wears the glasses with the zeros for the eyes.

INT. NEW HELVETIA COFFEE SHOP. AFTERNOON.

This is where she got high the first time and the band played

-	now Lady Bird learns the cash-register, espresso machine, and then sees Kyle Scheible, that amazing looking bassist, sitting at a table outside, plowing through “The People’s History of the United States.”

Later, he steps outside to smoke, she notices and follows:

LADY BIRD
Hey! I like your band with Jonah
Ruiz, L'enfance Nue?
(she pronounces it
Lenfance New)

KYLE
(correcting her
pronunciation)
L’enfance Nue.

LADY BIRD
I saw your Thanksgiving show. My

name’s Lady Bird.
 
50.



They shake hands. There is something instantly sexual between them. Lady Bird has never felt this thing before. She gets all R&B songs ever written in one moment.

KYLE

It’s weird you shake hands.

LADY BIRD

Yeah.

(lying)
Yeah, I’m friends with Jenna and
she’s always talking about how
great your band is so I wanted to

check it out.

KYLE
Jenna’s hella tight. Well maybe
I’ll see you at the Deuce or
something.

LADY BIRD

Sure, see you at the Deuce.

COOL TWENTY SOMETHING
(yelling out to Lady Bird)
I’m not paying you to flirt!

LADY BIRD
(embarrassed)

I wasn’t flirting.

KYLE

I wish you had been.

And then he’s gone. Lady Bird’s loins are on fire.

INT. LADY BIRD’S ROOM. NIGHT.

She writes Kyle’s name next to where she’d written Danny’s name. Touches her hand where he’d touched it. Then touches her mouth. She wants, she wants.
 
50.


SECOND SEMESTER

INT. CHURCH. DAY.

Joint liturgy at another beginning of the semester. Lady Bird sits next to Julie and sings in the choir and scans for Kyle.

From under her choir robe, Lady Bird pulls out “The People’s History of the United States” and reads it while the priest delivers the homily.

Danny tries to make eye contact with Lady Bird but she coldly looks away. Her eyes rest on Jenna - she wants Kyle as her boyfriend and Jenna as her friend. She wants to be part of this thing, this popular-straight-kid thing she’s always been outside of.

Lady Bird takes her blessing, arms crossed.

INT. HOMEROOM. DAY.


JENNA

The first time we did it was at his lake house last summer. It was so funny...

Julie hands Lady Bird a sack lunch:

JULIE

From Uncle Matt. I think he and my Mom are fighting, so enjoy these lunches while you can.

LADY BIRD
Oh, no thanks, I’m trying to lose

weight.

JULIE

Really?

But Lady Bird isn’t paying attention. She’s angling towards

Jenna Walton, the tan, who holds court:

JENNA
Yeah, sex is not a big deal, it’s

just my mom called during it!

Everyone laughs.
 
51.



JENNA (CONT’D)

It was on my cell phone, she got it for emergencies.

LADY BIRD

Did you pick up?

JENNA

Yeah, I was like, "um, Mom, I can't really talk right now."

Everyone else laughs again. Julie now tries to join in:

JULIE
(to Jenna)
What was the emergency?

JENNA

What? Oh, my great aunt died.

JULIE

What was the emergency?

JENNA

Oh, my great aunt died.

LADY BIRD

I'm so sorry.

JENNA
She kind of did it to herself.
Yeah. I don’t know why do that if
you’re already so old.

Sister Sarah-Joan approaches:

SISTER SARAH-JOAN

Ladies - skirts?

Jenna's skirt doesn’t make the grade, it’s been hemmed.

SISTER SARAH-JOAN (CONT’D)

I’m going to write you a citation, Miss Walton.
 
52.



SISTER SARAH-JOAN

No more short skirts!

She continues on, inspecting other skirts.

JENNA

Sarah-Joan is all up in my jock.

LADY BIRD

She’s a cunt.

JULIE

Birdy you like her.

LADY BIRD
Yeah, but, she’s a cunt.
(to Jenna)
I have an idea of how to get Sarah-Joan back...

JENNA

How?

LADY BIRD

You’ll see. This afternoon?

JULIE

No, we have auditions this
afternoon.

LADY BIRD
I don’t think I want to do the
play.
(to Jenna)

Meet me in the teacher’s parking lot at 3. I’ll have the materials.
JENNA

Wait what was your name?

LADY BIRD

Lady Bird.

JENNA

Weird.

SISTER SARAH-JOAN

We have a decision to make: prom themes! The top options are -- Cities of the World, Eternal Flame, and Movies!

INT. XAVIER MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM/THEATRE. DAY.

Everyone who has come to audition is greeted by the new director: Father Walther, also the JV football coach.

GIRL #1
 
53.


Where’s Father Leviatch?

FATHER WALTHER

Alright let’s have everyone take a
knee.

Confusion. Miss Patty won’t make eye contact with them

MISS PATTY

Cozy sit.

FATHER WALTHER

So I know that you all miss Father Leviatch, all of the brothers do too, but I am going to give this my very best shot, okay? Usually I’m the J.V. football coach, but from what I can tell a “play” is a “play.”

No real response. Danny sits with Julie, whispers:

DANNY

Where’s Lady Bird?

JULIE
(quietly angry)

With her new best friend. She thinks she’s too cool for theatre.

Father Walther wheels out a blackboard and picks up chalk.

FATHER WALTHER
Now if you can pull out your
scripts. I’ve assigned a number to
each of your roles. I’m going to
put the blocking on this board, and
if you guys can transcribe into

your plays, that’d be great.

JULIE
(calling out)
Who is playing what part?

FATHER WALTHER

I had Miss Patty assign parts because she already knows you all.

Miss Patty nods.

FATHER WALTHER (CONT’D)

Call ‘em out Miss Patty!

Miss Patty starts:
 
54.



MISS PATTY
(slightly drunk on power)

Uh, Prospero, Danny.

Julie is Miranda - she’s happy, maybe she’s good at this?

EXT. TEACHER PARKING LOT. AFTERNOON.

Jenna and Lady Bird are decorating the nun mini-van with tin cans and streamers and attach a sign to the back that reads:

JUST MARRIED TO JESUS.

As they’re completing their mission:

JENNA

Wait, where do you live?

LADY BIRD

Oh, um, the 40s.

JENNA
That’s where our starter house was!

Which street?

LADY BIRD
(lying, again)
Um, 44th it’s, um, it’s the three
story blue house with the white
shutters and the American flag in

the front.

She describes the house that she and Julie lusted after last fall, Danny’s Grandmother’s house.

JENNA

I know that one! Wanna go over there now and eat? I live in Granite Bay otherwise I’d say lets go there.

LADY BIRD
Um, actually, I was thinking -
maybe we should go to the Deuce?
(trying to be casual)
I was talking to Kyle about it and he was like “whatever it’s lame but maybe I’ll see you there.”

JENNA

How do you know Kyle?
 
55.



LADY BIRD
My Mom made me get a job at New
Helvetia to learn “responsibility”
Anyway we hang out there.

JENNA
Yeah, Kyle’s awesome. let’s Deuce
it up.

INT. XAVIER MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM/THEATRE. DAY.

Father Walther is writing all the blocking on the blackboard like the football coach he is. All the students are frantically taking down the notes in their scripts.

EXT. SIERRA II. “THE DEUCE.” PARKING LOT. DAY.

Jenna joins Jonah & co in the parking lot, drinking and smoking. Kyle is there, sitting on top of a car reading another big book, a theoretical math book. For fun.

LADY BIRD

This is the Deuce? It’s a parking lot? We were in one parking lot and we went to another parking lot.

JENNA
(calling out)

KYLE! Lady Bird and I just decorated the nun-mobile like “just married to Jesus!

KYLE

That’s hella tight.

He nods, appreciating this. Jonah starts to make out with Jenna. Lady Bird tries not to watch.

KYLE (CONT’D)

What you did was very baller, very anarchist.

LADY BIRD

Yeah, fuck ‘em.

KYLE

Don’t worry, I’m not gonna snitch on you.

LADY BIRD
(fake threatening)
I hope not, because I’d fucking
kill your family.
 
56.



KYLE

What?

LADY BIRD

Sorry that was an exaggeration.

KYLE

It’s okay. My Dad has cancer. So I guess God is doing that for us.

LADY BIRD

Oh... I’m sorry.

They’re quiet for a second, he’s said something heavy.

KYLE

You work at New Helvetia, right?

LADY BIRD

Right.

KYLE
Can I get your number? We were
looking to set up some more gigs

down there...

LADY BIRD

Definitely.

He holds out his hand and a pen. Lady Bird takes his hand and the pen. When she touches him, it’s the same as before: SEX.

LADY BIRD (CONT’D)

It’s my parents’ number.

KYLE

You don’t have a cell phone?

LADY BIRD

Nah.

KYLE

Good girl. The government didn’t have to put tracking devices on us, we bought them and put them on ourselves.

LADY BIRD

I don’t own a tracking device...

KYLE

No the cell phones. See?
 
57.



LADY BIRD

Wow.

KYLE
Yeah. I know. I mean you’ll have
one eventually. Everyone’s gonna
have one. And then it’ll be a
matter of time.

LADY BIRD

Before what?

KYLE

Before they put them in our brains.

Lady Bird laughs and then stops herself. He is dead fucking serious. She wants to touch him again but can’t invent a reason why.

INT. NEW HELVETIA COFFEE SHOP. AFTERNOON.

Lady Bird works. Zones out from time to time, thinking about Kyle. Danny comes in and then lurks. She spots him, goes to throw out the trash, annoyed that he’s there.

EXT. ALLEY BEHIND NEW HELVETIA COFFEE SHOP. AFTERNOON.

Lady Bird walks out, Danny follows her. She wheels around:

LADY BIRD

What do you want from me?

He doesn’t say anything.

LADY BIRD (CONT’D)

YES?!

DANNY
My Grandma wanted me to tell you

she missed you at Christmas.

LADY BIRD
Yeah, well, I couldn’t have gone
anyway... my Mom was pissed about
Thanksgiving.

DANNY
(nodding)
Your mom is crazy. I’m scared of
her.
 
58.



LADY BIRD
(suddenly defensive)

She’s not crazy, she’s just, she has a big heart. She’s very warm.

DANNY

I don’t find your mother warm.

LADY BIRD

You don’t?

DANNY
Well no yeah she’s warm but she’s

also kind of scary.

LADY BIRD

You can’t be scary and warm.

DANNY
(logically debating)
I think you can, your Mom is.

LADY BIRD YOU’RE

YOU’RE GAY!

That shuts him up. They’re quiet.

DANNY
(suddenly, desperate)

Fuck me. Can you not tell anyone, please? I’m so sorry about everything. I’m so ashamed of all of it. It’s going to be bad and I just need a little bit of time to figure out how I’m going to tell my mom and dad.

He almost starts crying.

LADY BIRD
(pats him awkwardly)

Don’t worry, I won’t tell.

DANNY
(leaning into her,sobbing)
Thank you.
 
59.






He’s telling the truth and she is genuinely touched. They embrace again. They are friends, real friends now.

INT. PSYCH HOSPITAL. CHECK-IN. DAY.

Marion helps a patient fill out a questionnaire. It is Father Leviatch, who looks how he feels - crushed by bottomless despair. This is his struggle.

MARION
...and do you have a support

system?

FATHER LEVIATCH

What do you mean?

MARION
(gently)
Who do you turn to when you feel
this way?

FATHER LEVIATCH

No one, I guess. I’m sorry.

MARION
No, no, don’t be sorry. There’s

no wrong answer.

She looks at him with true empathy. He realizes something.

FATHER LEVIATCH

Please don’t tell your daughter.

MARION
No of course not. Of course

not.
 
60.



INT. CHURCH. DAY.

All of Xavier and Immaculate Heart of Mary are assembled for Ash Wednesday Mass.

Everyone gets ash on their forehead. Julie looks on enviously as Lady Bird jokes around with Jenna and flirts with Kyle from across the aisle.

The priest repeats the incantation every time he applies ashes to the foreheads.

PRIEST
Remember that you are dust and to
dust you shall return... Remember
that you are dust and to dust you
shall return....

INT. FAMILY/COMPUTER/MIGUEL’S ROOM. DAY.

Lady Bird sits at the computer with a list of instructions in front of her - Marion, Larry, Shelly and Miguel stand behind her.

LADY BIRD

It’s a new system - you just enter your social security number and...

She is presses ENTER and is lead you to a website that lists all the schools in the UC system she applied to with a “yes” or a “no” beside them. They all say no except for...

LADY BIRD (CONT’D)

DAVIS?!

MARION
(relieved)
Davis is good. Maybe you should

have looked at it.

LADY BIRD
It’s only half an hour away! Less

if you’re driving fast!

LARRY

I went to graduate school there.

SHELLY

Lots of smart people go to Davis.

LADY BIRD
I thought Berkeley had to accept
me. You and Miguel went there.
I’m a legacy.
 
61.



LARRY

Eh, not if we don’t give money.

MIGUEL

And you get bad grades.

LADY BIRD

Oh what do you know about it?

MIGUEL

Meaning?

LADY BIRD

Nothing.

MIGUEL



(turning red)

What are you implying?

MIGUEL

YOU FUCKING RACIST.

LADY BIRD

I didn’t say anything.

MIGUEL

I DIDN’T PUT DOWN MY RACE!

LADY BIRD

I’m sure they had no idea, MIGUEL!

MIGUEL

You are actually fucking
evil. What is wrong with you?

MARION

GO - GO TO YOUR ROOM!

LADY BIRD

I’m not FIVE!

MARION
I did not raise you like this, I

didn’t --

LADY BIRD
I don’t have to go ANYWHERE! I’m
not going to a fucking university
that’s famous for it’s fucking
AGRICULTURAL SCHOOL.

She runs out, furious. She’d kick the computer if she could.

LADY BIRD (O.S.) (CONT’D)

AND MIGUEL AND SHELLY YOU’LL NEVER
 
62.



GET JOBS WITH ALL THAT SHIT IN YOUR FACE!

Miguel self-consciously puts his hand to his nose-ring, rotating it. Shelly mentally tallies all her piercings.
 
63.



INT. JENNA'S HOUSE. NIGHT.

A fancy McMansion, giant but not utterly tasteless. A low-key house party. Lady Bird wanders through the palatial house, looking for Jenna. Runs up to her:

LADY BIRD

Hey!

JENNA
(hugging her)

Hi! Help yourself to anything in the fridge. My parent’s are upstairs but they don’t care if you drink.

She nods and moves on. What she’s looking for is Kyle of course. She spots Kyle outside, reading a book and smoking.

EXT. JENNA'S HOUSE. BY THE POOL. NIGHT.

Lady Bird casually slinks outside and lights up a clove, like she does it all the time. Kyle notices like he was meant to.

KYLE

I hate that shit.

LADY BIRD

But you smoke.

KYLE
Hand rolled cigarettes - never
industrially produced and never

cloves.

LADY BIRD

What’s wrong with cloves?

KYLE

You can’t inhale cloves. What’s
the point?

LADY BIRD

Oh...

KYLE

You’re not supposed to.

LADY BIRD
Cloves were what I first smoked,
when I was young, so you know,
force of habit.

KYLE

Huh. Well it has fiber glass.
 
64.



LADY BIRD

Really?

KYLE

Rolling your own is best. Also I’m trying to, as much as is possible, not participate in our economy. I don’t like money. I am trying to live by bartering alone.

LADY BIRD
But doesn’t Catholic school cost

money?

KYLE

Yeah the diocese were not super into it.
(then)

It mattered to my Dad that I go to Xavier, so just trying to make him happy.

She sits down next to him. He touches her face. She breathes out hard. He kisses her and she kisses back.

CUT TO:

Another part of the house: Kyle and Lady Bird are making out full on. She wants it, but not so fast:

LADY BIRD
I don’t want to have sex yet. I
haven’t had sex yet. With another
person.

KYLE

No, me neither.

LADY BIRD

Really?

KYLE

Yeah.

LADY BIRD

Cool.

They start making out again. They fall into a door and it reveals THE FAMOUS TANNING BED. Lady Bird laughs.

LADY BIRD (CONT’D)

Oh my god! It’s the tanning bed!
Julie will love this!
 
65.



KYLE

Who’s Julie?

INT. BATHROOM. DAY.

Lady Bird sits on the edge of the tub and looks at a picture of Kyle from the “Xavier” insert in the Immaculate Heart of Mary Yearbook.

CUT TO:

Just Lady Bird’s feet on either side of the tub-tile, the water streaming down. It’s obvious what she’s doing.

CUT TO:

She’s out. She has towels wrapped around her body and head. She rummages around the medicine cabinet. She sees a pill bottle and looks at it. It’s antidepressants for her Dad. She puts it back, carefully.

MARION (O.S.)

Lady Bird! You can’t lock yourself in there! We have one bathroom!
LADY BIRD
(opening the door)
Sorry, sorry, sorry!

LADY BIRD (CONT’D)

It’s just this is the only place I can get any privacy.

Marion clocks the towels around Lady Bird’s head and body:

MARION
Do you really need to use two

towels?

LADY BIRD

No, I guess no.

MARION

If you need two towels you just have to say so because this affects my whole day, I have to do laundry before work and I need to know if there are more towels I need to wash.

LADY BIRD

I just need one, sorry.
 
66.



MARION
OK, well let me get to the mirror,

I gotta get going.

Lady Bird backs up, watches Marion put on makeup.

LADY BIRD

When do you think is a normal time to have sex?

MARION
(drops her mascara)
You’re having sex?

LADY BIRD

No!

MARION
Uh, college is good, I think
college. Use protection. Like we
talked about.

LADY BIRD

Ok.

They regard each other.

LADY BIRD (CONT’D)

Is Dad depressed?

MARION
(looking from the mirror)

Why do you ask that?

LADY BIRD
The pills... they have Dad’s name
on them.

Marion’s not sure she should talk about it, but then does:

MARION
Dad’s been struggling with

depression for years.

LADY BIRD

I didn’t know that.
 
67.



MARION

Money is not life’s report card.

LADY BIRD

He’s depressed about money?

MARION

Being successful doesn’t mean anything in and of itself. It just means that you’re successful.

LADY BIRD
(confused)
Yeah, but then you’re successful.

MARION

But that doesn’t mean you’re happy.

LADY BIRD

But he’s not happy.

EXT. JENNA’S HOUSE. POOL. DAY.

Lady Bird and Jenna messing around in her big pool, splashing each other, being teenage ladies-of-leisure. Lady Bird is feeling the weight of her life, the heft of it.

LADY BIRD

I have to get out of Sacramento.

JENNA

Why?

LADY BIRD

Because it’s soul-killing. It’s the mid-west of California.

JENNA
Isn’t there a thing, like: “think

globally, act locally.”

LADY BIRD
I feel that the person who said

that didn’t live in Sacramento.

JENNA

I love it here. I want to send my daughters to Immaculate Heart. I want to be, you know, be a mom.
 
68.




LADY BIRD

At least go to San Francisco.

JENNA

I don't like hills.

Jenna disappears under the water. Lady Bird considers that perhaps Jenna is not such a good fit for her as a friend, even if she is popular and cool. They aren’t the same.

INT. ALGEBRA II CLASS. DAY.

Julie’s desk is empty beside Lady Bird. She misses her real friend.

INT. ST. FRANCIS HALLWAYS. DAY.

Lady Bird sees Julie walking in the hallway with Darlene, the weird girl from choir. She calls out:

LADY BIRD

Julie! Julie! Julie, hey!

DARLENE
(aggressive)
What do you want from Julie?

LADY BIRD

Darlene can you excuse us?

JULIE

Darlene, stay.

So Darlene stays, her creepy cow eyes taking in the scene.

LADY BIRD

Why aren’t you in Algebra II?

JULIE

I switched sections.

LADY BIRD

Why?
 
69.



JULIE

Aren’t Jenna and Kyle enough?

LADY BIRD

I’m sorry that you’re jealous.

JULIE

HA! Jenna is a moron, you know.

LADY BIRD

She’s not. She’s in AP Calculus.

JULIE

She’s a moron in a deeper sense.

LADY BIRD

You don’t even know her.

JULIE

--	Miss Patty assigned you a role, by the way. You just never showed up to claim it.

LADY BIRD

What role?

JULIE

“The Tempest.”

LADY BIRD

There is no role of “The Tempest.”

JULIE

It’s the titular role!

LADY BIRD

No, it’s a made up thing so we all can participate.

JULIE

Can’t do anything unless you’re the center of attention, can you?

LADY BIRD
Yeah, well, you know your mom's

tits? They're FAKE. TOTALLY FAKE.

JULIE

She made a bad decision at 19!

LADY BIRD

Two bad decisions.
 
70.



Julie leaves with Darlene. Lady Bird is furious and righteous.

INT. IMMACULATE HEART OF MARY GYM. DAY.

Everyone sits on the bleachers for a “special assembly.” Jenna and Lady Bird sit together. Lady Bird loves being seen with her at this public event.

A woman is speaking - she is heavy-set with a “wedge” haircut. She holds up models of fetuses.
 
70.


CASEY
And at fifteen, this girl was
pregnant. She decided that she
was going to get an abortion. It
made sense. It was the right

thing to do.

LADY BIRD
(whispering)
Let me guess she didn’t get it.

CASEY

And she was sitting there waiting for the doctor to come in and something deep inside her said NO.

LADY BIRD

Bingo.

CASEY

Anyone want to guess who this woman is?

Hands shoot up.

CASEY (CONT’D)

The young lady right here.

YOUNG LADY

You?
 
71.



CASEY

No, it was not me.

ANOTHER YOUNG LADY

Um, your friend?

CASEY

No, the girl in the story was... my mother.

Gasps from the audience.

CASEY (CONT’D)

I am that baby that she decided not to abort.

Cut to: Laminated graphics about abortion are being passed around.

CASEY (CONT’D)

That could have been me, that could have been my fate.

LADY BIRD
(to Jenna)
Just because something looks ugly
doesn’t mean that it is morally
wrong.

Unfortunately this comment was loud enough for Casey to hear.

CASEY

What did you say, ma’am?

LADY BIRD

Nothing.

CASEY

Please share.

Lady Bird looks at Jenna and decides that she’s really going to impress her:

LADY BIRD
(loud)

I said “Just because something looks ugly doesn’t mean that it is morally wrong.”


The girls are shocked and embarrassed, but laughing too.
 
72.



CASEY
You think dead children aren’t

morally wrong?

LADY BIRD

No...

She’s going all in:

LADY BIRD (CONT’D)

I’m just saying that if you took up close pictures of my vagina while I was on my period it would be disturbing but it doesn’t make it wrong.

GASPS! Sister Sarah-Joan clocks Lady Bird’s escalating mania. She briefly makes eye-contact with her. Lady-Bird is ashamed, but uses her shame to plow ahead rather than turn back.

CASEY
(horrified)
Excuse me? What did you say?

LADY BIRD

Listen, if your mother had had the abortion we wouldn't have to sit through this stupid assembly?

MARION (O.S.)

Suspended?! HOW DOES THIS HAPPEN?!

INT. FAMILY/COMPUTER/MIGUEL’S ROOM. NIGHT.

Marion is furious. Larry pretends to work on the computer.
 



MARION

EVERYTHING we do is for you. EVERYTHING. You think I like driving that car around. Do you? You think I like working double shifts at the psych hospital? You needed to go to the Catholic school because your brother saw someone knifed in front of him at the public school, is that what you want?

MARION

(turns on Larry)
 




LADY-BIRD


No.
No.

No. No....

 
LARRY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING ON THE

COMPUTER?!

Nothing.
