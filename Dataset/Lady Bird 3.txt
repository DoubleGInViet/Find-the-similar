MARION

 

(back to Lady Bird)
You think Dad and I don’t know how
ashamed that you are of us? Your
dad knows, your dad knows why you
ask us to drop you a block away
from school every day -

LADY BIRD

- Dad I didn’t mean to -
 

MARION

-	You made him feel horrible HORRIBLE do you know that?
LADY BIRD
(crying)
I’m sorry.

Larry chimes in.
 
74.



LARRY

Marion you didn’t have to bring
that up -

MARION

-	No, Larry, you can’t just be the nice guy, she has to know, she has to know how you feel otherwise she’s just gonna think that she can say anything at all and nobody ever gets hurt.”Wrong side of the tracks”.

LADY BIRD

I didn’t mean it that way, it was a joke --

MARION

Yeah, it’s just a joke: “Mom and Dad, they don’t care.” We didn’t think we’d be in this house for twenty-five years, we thought we’d move somewhere better, Whatever we give you, it’s never enough.

LADY BIRD

It is enough.


MARION

Do you have any idea how much it cost to raise you? How much you’re THROWING away every day?

Lady Bird, tired of being berated, furiously gets a pen and a piece of paper, poised to write, cuts Marion off:

LADY BIRD

Give me a number.

MARION

What?

LADY BIRD

GIVE ME A NUMBER!

MARION

I don’t understand.

LADY BIRD

You give me a number for how much it cost to raise me, and I’m going to get older and make a lot of money and write you a check for what I owe you so that I NEVER HAVE TO SPEAK TO YOU AGAIN.
 
75.



MARION

I highly doubt that you will be able to get a job good enough to do that.

Lady Bird screams and raises her hand at her mother. Brings it down without striking. Leaves the room without a sound.

INT. LADY BIRD’S HOUSE. EARLY AFTERNOON.

Lady Bird lounging - watching television. Life during Suspension. All these reports about the lead up to the Iraq war. It’s simultaneously terrifying and boring. The phone rings and she JUMPS at it.

LADY BIRD
(into the phone)
Hello?

JENNA (O.S.)

Hi, it’s me! Jenna.

LADY BIRD
(looking at the time)
Are you calling me from school?

JENNA (O.S.)

No, we got out early because all the Irish girls got totally sloshed by noon...

LADY BIRD
Oh, right, happy Saint Patrick’s

Day!

JENNA (O.S.)

I guess they’d been stock-piling mini liquor bottles in the tampon machines. Now they’re all throwing up. Everyone else got out early. So GUESS where I am?!

LADY BIRD

I don’t know, where?

Reveal that Jenna is:

EXT. DREAM HOUSE. EARLY AFTERNOON.

It is the house. Danny’s Grandmother’s house. The blue one with the white shutters and the American Flag. The one Lady Bird said she lived in. Jenna is standing there in her uniform.
 
76.



JENNA

DING DONG I’M OUTSIDE!

She rings the doorbell.

LADY BIRD (O.S.)

Oh, shit, no, I’m... wait.

LADY BIRD (O.S.)

LEAVE! JUST UM, LEAVE!



INT. LADY BIRD’S KITCHEN. EARLY AFTERNOON.

CUT TO:

Lady Bird and Jenna in her kitchen. Her real kitchen.

JENNA
(looking around)

So this is your house?

LADY BIRD

Yeah.

JENNA
The woman who lived in the other

house was totally freaked out.

LADY BIRD

That’s my friend’s grandma. That’s her house.

JENNA

Why did you say it was your house?

Reaching for the truth that explains it:

LADY BIRD

I wished I lived in that house.


JENNA

I don’t even sort of understand why somebody would lie about that.
 
77.



LADY BIRD

I didn’t lie.

JENNA

You lied, you’re a liar.

JENNA

I hate dishonesty.

LADY BIRD

I’m sorry.

JENNA

Apology accepted, I guess.

LADY BIRD
(concerned)
Are we still friends?

JENNA
I mean, if you’re still Kyle’s
girlfriend, then yeah, I guess
I’ll see you around.

Lady Bird looks worried - is she still Kyle’s girlfriend? INT. KYLE’S ROOM. KYLE’S HOUSE. DAY.

They watch the news, not touching but oh man she wants to touch.

CUT TO:

Kyle and Lady Bird are making out pretty heavily. Lady Bird is on top. She whispers:

LADY BIRD

I’m ready.

KYLE
(regular voice)

What?

LADY BIRD
(a bit louder)
I’m ready... to have sex...

KYLE

Okay, great.
 
78.



He reaches over, fetches a condom. Gets it on somehow.

LADY BIRD

You’re so dextrous with that... Oh!

They’re sort of having sex now. She’s still on top. It goes on for a little bit. Then he stops moving.

LADY BIRD (CONT’D)
(whispering)

Are you...? Done?

KYLE

Yeah. Yes.

LADY BIRD

Sorry, I was confused.

She looks at him. His face is all splotchy.

KYLE

You have some kind of - blood!

LADY BIRD
(hands to her face)
Oh, shit, I get nose bleeds.

I’m sorry.

CUT TO:

Kyle reads. Lady Bird holds a Kleenex to her nose, and looks at a bulletin board with the class picture from first grade - little Kyle wears a tie-dye shirt.

LADY BIRD (CONT’D)
Remember when “tie-dye” was an

activity?
 
79.



KYLE
(glancing up)

I didn’t make that shirt, my parents bought it for me at Sea Ranch, you can read “Sea Ranch” if you look close.

LADY BIRD
(making a joke)
Cut to “ten years later.”

KYLE

What?

LADY BIRD

Like how ten years ago you were in first grade and now we... Cut to!
KYLE
(quizzical)
What does “cut to” mean to you?

LADY BIRD

Or like "little did he know..."

KYLE

Nothing you're saying makes sense.

LADY BIRD

How we’re not virgins now! We deflowered each other. We have each other’s flowers.

She kisses him and tries to hold him but then backs off.

LADY BIRD (CONT’D)

Sorry, I’m just happy.

KYLE

I didn’t lose my virginity to you.

LADY BIRD

Wait - what?

KYLE
I lost my virginity to Cassie

Duval.

LADY BIRD

Excuse me?
 
80.



LADY BIRD

You said you were a virgin.

KYLE

No I didn’t. Because I’m not. And I haven’t lied in two years.

LADY BIRD

Oh Jesus.

KYLE

Yeah, I’ve probably slept with, six people?

LADY BIRD
You don’t even know if it’s six

people?

KYLE

I don’t keep a list.

LADY BIRD

Why wouldn’t you keep a list we’re in high school?

KYLE

Why are you getting so moody?

LADY BIRD

You did say you were a virgin.

KYLE

I think you might have made an assumption.

LADY BIRD

I just had a whole experience that was wrong.

She sits. Kyle opens his book up again and then closes it:

KYLE

You're deciding to be upset.

LADY BIRD

No, I am upset.

KYLE

Because you’re deciding to be. Don't be mad at me for this. That's stupid. You can't be mad at me for something I have no control over now.

LADY BIRD

I just wanted it to be special.
 
81.



KYLE
Why? You’re going to have so much

un-special sex in your life.

LADY BIRD
(fully angry now)
I was on top! Who the fuck is on
top their first time!

KYLE
Do you have any awareness about
how many civilians we’ve killed
since invasion in Iraq started?

LADY BIRD

SHUT UP. SHUT UP. Different things can be sad. It’s not all war.

Kyle moves away and opens a book.

LADY BIRD
(worried)
Are we still going to prom
together?

KYLE

Sure.

Kyle has been reading something out of the corner of his eye.

INT. KITCHEN. KYLE’S HOUSE. DAY.

Lady Bird sneaks down the stairs, still crying, trying to get away without a conversation. Through a door, she sees Kyle’s Dad. He’s very thin and wears lots of sweaters, obviously sick. He drinks a cup of tea.

EXT. KYLE’S HOUSE. DAY.

Lady Bird waits outside, sitting on the curb. The Toyota Corolla pulls up. It’s Marion. Lady Bird does a double-take.
INT./EXT. 1994 TOYOTA COROLLA. EARLY EVENING.

As Lady Bird climbs in the car:

LADY BIRD

I thought Miguel was going to pick me up.
 
82.



MARION

Well, I was just arriving from work and...

She wants to say she misses Lady Bird but instead says:

MARION (CONT’D)

It was easier.

Lady Bird starts crying. Very hard. Marion pulls over, hugs her:

MARION (CONT’D)

Hey, it’s okay, it’s okay.

As she’s rubbing her back, Marion takes in Lady Bird’s shirt, she doesn’t recognize it.

MARION (CONT’D)

What is this sweater?

LADY BIRD

Oh, it’s just, my friend Jenna gave it to me.

MARION

Who’s Jenna?

LADY BIRD

My friend.

Marion doesn’t know her daughter’s friends, her t-shirts, or why she’s crying. She holds Lady Bird, then thinks of something:

MARION

... want to do our favorite Sunday activity? I don’t have a second shift...

Lady Bird nods, it would be nice.

INT./EXT. OPEN HOUSES AROUND SACRAMENTO. DAY.

Marion and Lady Bird go to all the different open houses. They love doing this. They could never buy any of them, but it is so neat to see the inside of houses you’ve always known, and to imagine a different life. Where would your bed go?, etc. It’s a great day. Maybe the best in a long time. Maybe ever.
 
83.



INT. LADY BIRD’S HOUSE. DAY.

Lady Bird is back to watching television. The invasion is full on, it’s the Shock and Awe portion of the Iraq war.

MIGUEL
Lady Bird! A bunch of things

arrived for you!

Lady Bird rushes in, snatches the envelopes from his hand:

LADY BIRD
(turning hot)
Holy shit!

MIGUEL

Since when do you get mail?

LADY BIRD

I get mail.

MIGUEL
Whatever you’re up to, it’s not

going to end well.

INT. LADY BIRD’S ROOM. DAY.

She opens a bunch of letters - they are all rejections.

EXCEPT for one letter, the letter that says “Wait-listed.” She screams silently to herself. Not yes but it’s not no.

INT. OFFICE BUILDING. MORNING.

Larry sits across from Business Jock, just 30.

BUSINESS JOCK
The programmers now are, like,

kids, man!

LARRY
I know - but that’s why I think
with me you’ll find something
different.

BUSINESS JOCK

YEAH BUT THEY’RE LIKE BABIES.

LARRY

I hear you, it’s wild. Which is why (pointing at his resume)
(MORE)
 
84.


LARRY (CONT'D)
I got my MBA at UC Davis while
still working at ISC.

BUSINESS JOCK
Oh, wow. That must of been a lot
of work.

LARRY

It was.

BUSINESS JOCK

I heard ISC is closing now, though.

LARRY

I heard, yes.

BUSINESS JOCK
So the assholes who fired you are

now closing up shop.

LARRY
(not feeling it)
Feels good.

They sit for a second.

BUSINESS JOCK
(looking around)
Yeah... What else is supposed to
happen?

LARRY

Oh, I thought we were going to talk about the position.

INT. OFFICE BUILDING. WAITING ROOM. DAY.

Larry leaves his awkward interview to come get Lady Bird.

She’s reading a stack of old magazines.

LADY BIRD

How’d it go?
 
85.



LARRY
(exhausted)
Let’s go buy a big bag of Doritos
and eat them in the car to
celebrate your waitlist.

LADY BIRD
(laughing)
Don’t tell Mom! About the Doritos
or the waitlist!

Then Miguel enters the waiting room. Larry and Lady Bird do a double take. Miguel looks much more conventional. Handsome, too. All his piercings are out, his tattoos covered.

LARRY

Oh... hi, son!

LADY BIRD

Wait, what are you doing here?

MIGUEL
I guess we’re um, going for the

same job then?

LARRY

It looks like it. Go get ‘em!

Larry and Miguel hug.


Miguel goes in to the interview. Larry watches him go, feeling how you’d be feeling at that moment. Lady Bird aches for her Dad.

INT. VICE PRINCIPAL SISTER SARAH-JOAN'S OFFICE. DAY.

Lady Bird hands in homework from being suspended. Sarah-Joan looks it over, then:

SISTER SARAH-JOAN
I know it was you who did the “Just
Married” thing.

LADY BIRD

It wasn’t me.

SISTER SARAH-JOAN

I’m not going to punish you.
 
86.



LADY BIRD

Oh... why not?

SISTER SARAH-JOAN
(laughing)
It was funny. Sister Gina and I
drove all the way home before we
noticed people were honking.

LADY BIRD

Really?

SISTER SARAH-JOAN
To be fair, I wasn’t just married
to Jesus. It’s been forty

years...

LADY BIRD

Well he’s a lucky guy.

SISTER SARAH-JOAN
(she considers Lady Bird)
I read your college essay. You
clearly love Sacramento.

LADY BIRD

I do?

SISTER SARAH-JOAN
Well, you write about Sacramento so

affectionately, and with such care.

LADY BIRD

I was just describing it.

SISTER SARAH-JOAN

It comes across as love.

LADY BIRD

Sure, I guess I pay attention.

SISTER SARAH-JOAN
Don’t you think maybe they are the

same thing? Love and attention?
 
87.



INT. THRIFT TOWN. DAY.

Marion and Lady Bird are looking for a prom dress. Lady Bird is in the dressing room trying things on.

MARION
(sadly)

I guess you won’t be going to dances in college. This is our last one.
(then)
You know, Davis has a terrific theatre. If you’re still interested in theatre. Are you?

Lady Bird comes out in a dress, it’s too tight:

LADY BIRD
I’m probably no good at acting.
(looking at herself)
Why don’t I look like the girls in the magazines?

MARION

It’s too bad I can’t meet this Kyle before prom.

LADY BIRD
He’s not my boyfriend anymore. I

mean, maybe he never even was.

MARION

I’d still like to meet him.

LADY BIRD (O.S.)
(re: the dress)

IT’S TOO TIGHT! FUCK.

Lady Bird goes back into the dressing room.

MARION
I suggested you not take that

second helping of pasta...

LADY BIRD

MOM!
 
88.



MARION
(innocent)
Honey, you seem upset about it,
I’m trying to help you.

LADY BIRD
Mom! You’re giving me an eating
disorder!

LADY BIRD (CONT’D)
(to herself)
I wish I could get an eating
disorder.

Lady Bird comes out again. The dress kind of fits her. It’s bright pink and frilly. She looks happy:

LADY BIRD (CONT’D)

I love it.

Smiles up at her Mom, looking for approval:

MARION
(considering)

Is it too pink?

Lady Bird silently goes back into the dressing room. Her Mom just crushed something that she liked and was very “her.” Marion picks up that she’s upset:

MARION (CONT’D)

What?

LADY BIRD (O.S.)

Why can’t you say I look nice?

MARION
I thought you didn’t even care

what I think.

LADY BIRD (O.S.)
I still want you to think I look
good.

MARION
I’m sorry, I was telling you the
truth. Do you want me to lie?

LADY BIRD (O.S.)

No, I just wish... I wish that you liked me.
 
89.



MARION

Of course I love you.

Lady Bird comes out. Looks at Marion with the pure question:

LADY BIRD

But do you like me?

MARION
(faltering)
...I want you to be the very best
version of yourself you can be.

LADY BIRD

What if this is the best version?

INT. LADY BIRD’S HOUSE. NIGHT.

Lady Bird all dressed up in her pink dress. The one Marion didn’t like. Miguel, Shelly and Larry wait with her. She keeps checking the window.

SHELLY

You look really pretty.

LADY BIRD

Really?

Shelly nods.

SHELLY
You look like a bad ass girl in a

band.

This makes Lady Bird feel pretty amazing. Then a car horn honks. It’s Kyle. He literally honks.

LADY BIRD

Um, I guess, that’s my date.

LARRY

You aren’t going to get in the car with a guy who honks, are you?
LADY BIRD

I think, yes, I am.

Larry shrugs, accepting the situation.

LARRY
Let me get your picture. Mom’s
pissed she had to work a double.
 
90.



MIGUEL
(peering out the window)
Even you deserve better than this.

Larry snaps a picture of Lady Bird, standing alone.

SHELLY

Have a good time!

MIGUEL

Yeah, good luck!

Larry snaps a picture of Lady Bird, standing alone.

INT. KYLE’S CAR. NIGHT.

Lady Bird approaches and catches Jenna and Jonah talking in the back seat:

JONAH

I think she’s weird.

JENNA

She is weird.

LADY BIRD
(announcing herself)
Hey guys. I guess I’ll just, sit
shotgun? You look really nice,
Kyle.

KYLE

You look good.

He moves some books, probably math books, and she sits. Jenna doesn’t make eye contact with her.

INT. KYLE’S CAR. NIGHT.

Driving around with Jonah and Jenna. It’s no fun.

KYLE
(on the phone)
Hey, what’s going on, man. Yeah,
OK, that sounds great. OK.
(hangs up the phone)

Do you guys want to ditch prom and just go to Mike’s instead?

JENNA

Yeah, I hate dances.

JONAH

YES!

LADY BIRD

Yeah, okay. No prom.
 
91.

“Crash Into Me” comes on the radio.

KYLE

I fucking hate this song.
 
92.



He switches it. Suddenly Lady Bird sits up very straight.

LADY BIRD

I love it.

LADY BIRD

I actually want to go to prom.

KYLE

Um, okay? I mean I don’t really
wanna do that.

LADY BIRD

Can you take me to my friend
Julie’s house, please?

KYLE

Sure.

JENNA

Who’s Julie?

LADY BIRD

She’s my best friend.

EXT. JULIE’S APARTMENT COMPLEX. NIGHT.

Kyle drops off Lady Bird. Screeches away.

Lady Bird stands in front of Julie’s apartment complex. She’s milling around when a car pulls up: it’s Julie’s Mom, Ms. Pickett - coming in from grocery shopping.

INT. JULIE’S ROOM. NIGHT.

Julie’s Mom knocks on the door.

MS. PICKETT

Julie, honey, there’s someone here to see you.

She steps in. Julie looks up, she’s been crying.

LADY BIRD

Hi...

LADY BIRD (CONT’D)

Hey, are you okay?

JULIE

Oh, yeah, I’m fine, I’m fine.

LADY BIRD

What happened?

JULIE
 
93.


Nothing. Really, nothing.

LADY BIRD

Why are you crying?
 
94.



JULIE
I’m just crying - some people

aren’t built happy, you know?

CUT TO:

INT. JULIE’S KITCHEN. NIGHT.


CUT TO:

They laugh really hard. They catch their breath and notice that they are on the last slice of the block of cheese.

LADY BIRD

We ate all the cheese!

JULIE (CONT’D)
It’s ok, Blocks of cheese vary in
size, that was a small one.

LADY BIRD

So small.



LADY BIRD (CONT’D)

Fuck it, let’s go to prom. Doesn’t your Mom have a dress?

JULIE

Let’s be honest, I’ve had a dress for months. It’s purple and you’re really gonna like it.
 
95.


INT. PROM. NIGHT.

Julie and Lady Bird are slow dancing together. All the decorations, the whole thing, looks like hell, actual hell. There are flames everywhere. They are taking pictures together and happy - it is their last hurrah.

CUT TO:

EXT. DOWNTOWN SACRAMENTO. EARLY MORNING.

In their prom dresses. They watch the sun come up over Capital Bridge on the Sacramento River. Their small-town version of the sunrise scene over the Brooklyn Bridge in “Manhattan.”

LADY BIRD
People make so much noise in the
movies, but it’s really not a big
thing, you can totally be quiet

during it.

JULIE

Was it amazing, though?

LADY BIRD
(thinks)

I wanted it so badly but then I found that when it happened, I really like dry humping much more.

JULIE

You’re NOT a virgin.

LADY BIRD
(excited)
I can’t wait for State Fair.

JULIE

I know!
 
96.

 


LADY-BIRD
 



JULIE

 
LOG RIDE!
 

LOG RIDE!

 

They laugh. Then:

JULIE

Oh shit.

LADY BIRD

What?

JULIE



I’m not going to be here this

summer. All summer, basically.

LADY BIRD

Why not?

JULIE

Well, my Dad, my real Dad, resurfaced in Yellowstone and he wants me to come out there for the summer before I start SCC.

LADY BIRD

Oh.

JULIE

I’m not going anywhere to college, so it seemed like a good opportunity.

LADY BIRD
(trying to be happy for
her)
Yeah.

JULIE
I’m going to miss the fuck out of

you.

LADY BIRD

I probably won’t get in. So I’ll go to Davis and I’ll see you every day.
 
97.




INT. XAVIER THEATRE. NIGHT.

Lady Bird sits in the audience and watches The Tempest. Close on Danny performing Prospero’s last speech. It’s beautiful:

DANNY
... now I want

Spirits to enforce, art to enchant, And my ending is despair,
Unless I be relieved by prayer,
which pierces so that it assaults
mercy itself and frees all
faults. As you from crimes would
pardoned be, let your indulgence

set me free.

The play is over - Father Walther, ever the football coach, jumps up and cheers. Lady Bird has tears in her eyes. She loves watching her friend’s be great.

INT. CATHEDRAL. DAY.

Everyone is graduating.

INT. RESTAURANT. NIGHT.


Cut toLady Bird celebrating with her family, hugging them.

LARRY

To Miguel and his new job!
 
98.




MARION

To Lady Bird going to Davis!

MIGUEL
(to Lady Bird)
Hey, I talked to my manager, and
you can totally take over my job
for the summer.

LADY BIRD

Thanks, Miguel!

MARION

I’m so proud of you, Lady Bird. You walked weird across the stage, but you did it.

LADY BIRD

I didn’t walk weird!

MARION
It seemed a little weird, the way

you walked.

LADY BIRD

MOM!
 
99.




Marion smiles at Lady Bird. Lady Bird smiles back. Danny walks over to their table.He embraces her in a big hug. They’re friends, real friends.

DANNY

Hi, everyone! I miss you guys!

They all chorus that they miss him, too. Proudly:

DANNY (CONT’D)
Did you find out about the
wait list?

Marion looks at Lady Bird and then back to Danny.

LARRY

Oh, fuck.

MARION

What?

Marion’s eyes darken.

INT./EXT. LADY BIRD’S HOUSE. DAY.

Lady Bird is still in her graduation gown. Marion is doing dishes, laundry, not looking at her, not speaking to her. Lady Bird trails after her:

LADY BIRD

I’m not even in yet, so this might not even be a problem... Mom?

Follows Marion into the kitchen. She sees her Dad sitting in the living room, looking scolded: he’s just gotten an earful. Lady Bird keeps pursuing her Mom.
 
100



LADY BIRD (CONT’D)
I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have gone
behind your back, it’s not like I
am definitely going to New York.

Nothing from Marion.

LADY BIRD (CONT’D)
Mom. Mom. Aren’t you sort of
proud that I’m so close to
getting in? Just a little?

Follows Marion to the backyard, where she begins weeding. LADY BIRD (CONT’D)

I mean, yes, I know it was probably easier because 9/11 and less people applying with terrorism and all that, still though ... I’m sorry, I know I can lie and not be a good person but...

Follows Marion to the trash can, almost crying.

LADY BIRD (CONT’D) Please, Mom, please I’m so sorry, I didn’t mean to hurt you - I appreciate everything you’ve done for me, I’m ungrateful and I’m so sorry, I’m so sorry I wanted more...

Nothing from her. Marion goes back into the kitchen, screen door slamming behind her.Shouting now, panicked trying to get her attention.

LADY BIRD (CONT’D)

TALK TO ME! MOM! MOM! PLEASE! TALK TO ME. I know, I know, I know I’m so bad, just please! PLEASE.

Nothing from her mother.

INT. LADY BIRD’S ROOM. MORNING.

Dad comes in with a cupcake. Lady Bird is 18.

LARRY

Happy Birthday to you.

LADY BIRD

You remembered!

LARRY
You’re my only daughter. Well,

Shelly too, kind of. Make a wish.

Lady Bird blows out the candle. Then:

LADY BIRD
Are you and Mom going to get a

divorce over this?

LARRY
No... we can’t afford to! I’m

kidding, no. I love your Mom.

LADY BIRD
(looking down)

Does Mom hate me?

LARRY

You both have such... strong personalities. She doesn’t know how to help you and that frustrates her.

LADY BIRD

I wish she’d talk to me.

LARRY

She will, I know. Happy 18.

LADY BIRD

Thanks. Do you want some?

LARRY

Yes.

INT. CONVENIENCE STORE. DAY.

CONVENIENCE STORE CLERK (CONT’D)
(barely looking at it)

things. I can buy them.

CONVENIENCE STORE CLERK Okay, happy birthday.

EXT. CONVENIENCE STORE. DAY.

She smokes a cigarette. Legally. It’s gross.

EXT. LADY BIRD’S HOUSE. DAY.

Early morning. Lady Bird is sitting outside on the porch, writing. Trying to be like a lady poet. The mailman comes up and gives Lady Bird the mail.

She opens the paper to the obituaries, just like her Mom - sees that Kyle’s Dad has died.

Richard Scheible (1953-2003).

She goes to the lawn and sits down on the grass and thinks. Flips through the other mail. At the bottom is a fat letter from the college.

She opens it. She got in.

INT. BANK. DAY.

Larry and Lady Bird sit in front of a banker.

LARRY

So with her scholarships and then if we re-finance the house... then where are we?

LADY BIRD

Thank you for driving.

MARION

You’re welcome.

LADY BIRD

You aren't coming?

MARION
You can't walk up to the gate

anymore, anyway.

LADY BIRD

Yeah, but, I'm going to college.
 
Marion can barely look at her, it’s too hard and she’s too mad and hurts too much.

MARION
Dad will walk you to security,
parking is too expensive here.

Marion drives away abruptly. Lady Bird gets smaller in the frame. Marion is the focus. Marion circles, then circles back. She is crying now, she thought it would be easier to not say goodbye but it isn’t. She parks the car. Runs as fast as she can to go say goodbye.

Runs into the airport looking for Lady Bird and Larry. Sees Larry walking towards her.

LARRY
(hugging her while she
cries)
It’s ok, she’ll be back, she’ll
come back.

COLLEGE

INT. DORM ROOM. NIGHT.

Lady Bird unpacks, putting things in their places. She reaches in the front pocket of her suitcase and pulls out:

A manila envelope. She opens it, and all these letters fall out - crumpled up starts and half-starts. She looks at all of them one at a time. They all begin essentially the same:

“I love you so much and I don’t know how to tell you that, I can’t communicate it to you in a way that ...”

CUT TO:

Lady Bird is on the phone with Larry:

LARRY (O.S.)

She was worried that there would be errors, or mistakes or something...

(MORE)
 
LARRY (O.S.) (CONT'D)
that you’d judge her writing
abilities.

LADY BIRD

I wouldn’t do that.

LARRY (O.S.)

I thought you should have them.

LARRY (O.S.)

I want you to know how much she loves you but also don’t tell her I salvaged them, okay?

LADY BIRD

Ok...

She touches all these letters her mother couldn’t send. And she can never tell her that she has them.

INT. ANOTHER DORM ROOM. NIGHT

Lady Bird sits in a dorm room full of college freshman. She stares at a half drunk paper cup of rum in her hand. She looks up, questioning:

LADY BIRD

Hey. Do you believe in God?

COLLEGE BOY

No.

LADY BIRD

Why not?

COLLEGE BOY

Because it’s ridiculous.

LADY BIRD
(shaking her head)
People will call each other by
names their parents made up for
them but they won’t believe in
God.

COLLEGE BOY

What’s your name?

LADY BIRD
(considering)
Christine. My name is Christine.
 
COLLEGE BOY

I’m David.

They shake hands.

DAVID

You shake.

CHRISTINE

I shake.

DAVID

Where are you from?

CHRISTINE

Sacramento.

DAVID

Sorry, where?

The music was too loud, he hadn’t heard her. Second try:

CHRISTINE

San Francisco.

DAVID
Cool! San Francisco is a great

city.

She is immediately ashamed, but pleased with her social success. She drinks everything.

CUT TO:

Lady Bird is very drunk now. She leans out the window. David does, too. She yells at the sky.

LADY BIRD

BRUCE!

COLLEGE BOY

No, my name is David.

INT. LADY BIRD’S DORM. NIGHT.

Back in her dorm with the David. She is so drunk that she is half way between passing out and throwing up.

David is flipping through her giant CD case.
 
DAVID
Jesus Christ you have bad music.

It’s all Greatest Hits.

CHRISTINE
But they’re the Greatest, what’s

wrong with that?

David puts down the CD case and starts making out with her.

She throws up all over him.

DAVID

Oh, god, oh god!

He gets up and runs away, out of the room.

INT. DORM ROOM. NIGHT.

Christine being loaded onto some kind of strap down chair.

She is crying.

CHRISTINE

I’m sorry.

INT. HOSPITAL. NIGHT.

Christine looks up, half awake. A nurse comes into focus.

NURSE
What do you want us to do, she’s

drunk.

Christine passes out again.

INT. HOSPITAL. DAY.

Christine opens her eyes. Looks at her bracelet. Sits up. A child sits across from her with something definitely wrong with his eye. She winces.

She stands. It seems like she can just walk out. She does.

EXT. NYC STREET. DAY.

Christine is hung over but basically okay. Stops a man:

CHRISTINE

What day is it?

NYC MAN

Sunday.
 
CHRISTINE

Thank you.

She walks past a church. People are filing in. So does she.

INT. CHURCH. DAY.

Snippets of a sermon, some donation baskets. The choir gets up to sing “Blessed Assurance.”

Christine listens and then cries, hard, and then starts laughing and singing along. It turns out that her life is just beginning.

She ducks into the entry-way of the church. Gets out her phone, calls her home phone. It rings and rings. She leaves a message:

CHRISTINE

Hi Mom and Dad, it’s me. Christine. It’s the name you gave me. It’s a good one. Dad, this is more for Mom
-	Hey Mom: did you feel emotional the first time that you drove in Sacramento? I did and I wanted to tell you, but we weren’t really talking when it happened. All those bends I’ve known my whole life, and stores, and the whole thing. But I wanted to tell you. I love you. Thank you, I’m... thank you.

Hangs up and listens from the back of the church while the choir continues singing.
