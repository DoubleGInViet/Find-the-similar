INT. FULGHAM KINDERGARTEN -- WEDNESDAY MORNING

Two dozen KINDGERGARTNERS listen to their teacher, MS.
BERRY.	The word "Work" is on the blackboard.

MS. BERRY
"Work." Today we're going to
share what our parents do for
work.

QUICK CUTS of a series of five-year olds standing beside their desks, addressing the class:

JEFF
My dad is a truck driver.

MELINDA
My mommy is a doctor.

CAROLYN
My dad is a librarian and my
mom is a vegetarian.

THEODORE
(with difficulty)
My father is a struck-sher-al-
engine-ear.

CRAIG	-
My mother is an actress. She
works at Denny's.

KELLY
My daddy works at a place
where they make stuff, and my
mommy is a mommy.

ELLIOT
(looking a little
crazed)
My father is a postal worker.

The QUICK CUTS end with MAX:

MAX
My mom's a teacher.

As Max starts to sit:

MS. BERRY
And your dad?

MAX
(hesitant)
My dad? He's . . .  a liar.
 
MS. BERRY
(taken aback)
A liar? I don't think you !
mean "a liar."

MAX
Well... he wears'a suit and
goes to court and talks to the
judge and--

MS. BERRY
(relieved)
Oh! I see-- you mean he's a
lawyer.

Max shrugs.

INT. COURTROOM .-- DAY

FLETCHER REID, early 30's, stands before the JUDGE. His manner is utterly genuine and convincing.

FLETCHER
A dark street. . .	a stormy
night... two desperate men
struggle... one man is taken
to the hospital, the other to
jail. The prosecutor wants
you to believe this is an
open-and-shut case of a poor
man, brutally victimized.

He nods at the victim - - a  fragile OLD MAN in his 70's.

FLETCHER (CONT'D)
Well, for once I agree with
the prosecutor. This is an
open-and shut case -- but the
true victim is my client.

Fletcher's CLIENT is a 250 pound brute in a suit.

FLETCHER (CONT'D)
Put yourself in his shoes for

a	moment--walking home from church, alone, in a frightening part of the suburbs.

As he describes his client's movements, Fletcher ACTS THEM

OUT:
 

J
 
FLETCHER (CONT'D)
You're nervous, timid, looking
over your shoulder -- when
suddenly, you encounter him--
(pointing at the
old man)
pouncing from the shadows.
You quiver in fear.	The
streetlight flashes on
something shiny in his hand--
a knife?

Suddenly Fletcher becomes the attacker, brandishing a weapon. The jurors RECOIL.

FLETCHER (CONT'D)
And in that terrifying instant
you do what any respectable
citizen would -- you defend
yourself. Only after you
shatter his arm and collarbone
do you realize it's all a
mistake... the man was merely
walking away from an ATM
machine, the apparent flash of
metal caused by his bank card.

He reveals the weapon in his hand is only a credit card.

FLETCHER (CONT'D)
(concerned)
As you stand over his
crumpled, though potentially
still-dangerous form, your
heart goes out to him. You
want to help.	First, you
gather up the many bills he
dropped, to stop them from
blowing away. Second, in an
effort to get the name and
number of someone to notify,
you take his wallet. Finally,
you leap into the man's Lexus
to head for assistance, when
suddenly a police car speeds
up. You breathe a sigh of
relief: "Someone to look -after
the injured man! Oh joy!"
But do the police applaud your
initiative? Do they hail your
heroism? No-- they arrest you
and throw you in the slammer!

He walks along the jury box:
 
FLETCHER (CONT'D)
•	And why? Why does the State turn its massive power against this individual?

(takes an impressive moment, then answers his own question:)

Discrimination, (to a black juror)

But this time it's not based on race.
(to a female juror)
Not based on gender. (to a man wearing a crucifix)

Not based on religion, (to a heavy set juror)
No--this time it's
discrimination based on size!
. I know what the prosecution wants you to think - - i t ' s always the big guy's fault. Is that what we've come to as a society -- persecuting people because they're large?

Fletcher points accusingly at the opposition.

FLETCHER (CONT'D)
Shame on you, Mister
Prosecutor! Shame on you!
(turning back to
jury)
The state is trying to
barbeque my client on the spit
of Justice. Only you can douse
the flames.	The decision is
yours. And please...don't let
your emotions run away with
you. The fact that my client
is a family man, raising his
sons alone after the tragic
death of their mother, has
absolutely no bearing on this
case.

In the front row we see two sad-faced YOUNG CHILDREN.
 
FLETCHER (CONT'D)
Instead, let cold reason be
your guide as you decide the
fate of this church-going,
orphan-rasing widower!


Fletcher returns to his seat. Jurors, dab their eyes.

EXT. COURTHOUSE -- AFTERNOON

Fletcher bounds down the stairs, passing a fellow LAWYER,

LAWYER
How's it going, Fletcher?

FLETCHER
(he' s won)
Another gratifying day serving
Justice.

Fletcher's huge client catches up to him.

CLIENT
Hey great job, Mr. Reid.	I
wish there was some way I
could show my appreciation.

FLETCHER
Stay out of my neighborhood
after dark.

A PUBLICIST carrying, a clipboard approaches Fletcher.

PUBLICIST
Mr. Reid, do you have a •
moment-?

FLETCHER
No, I'm late picking up my
son.

PUBLICIST
-Because a couple of reporters
want to interview you about
your big win today.

Fletcher instantly shifts directions.

FLETCHER	.	.
How's my hair?

And he's off to woo a GANG OF REPORTERS.
 
EXT. SUBURBAN PORCH - AFTERNOON

A sad Max and his mother, AUDREY, wait silently on the steps.

MAX
What time is it?

AUDREY
(checks her
watch)
I ' m sure he just got tied up
in court again.

Finally, Fletcher's BMW pulls up. Max races to him, delighted.

MAX
Dad!

FLETCHER
Maximillian!
(calls out a
command)
TRANSFORMERS!! .

Fletcher instantly becomes a human version of the TRANSFORMER TOY making ROBOTIC MOVEMENTS and SOUNDS. Max knows the routine well, moves in perfect sine with dad. . ...
Until --	.

FLETCHER
Malfunction in vector 3 ! !
Malfunction in vector 3!!
(pretends to lose
control of a
'robotic' arm)
Look out!	It's on tickle
mode!!

Fletcher's "mechanical arm" becomes CLAW-LIKE, TICKLING MAX like crazy! Max loves it.

Audrey watches these two kids, smiles.

FLETCHER
(re: Audrey)
And who is this lovely lady?
Max, could you introduce me?

MAX
That's no lady, that's mom!

AUDREY.	•
Thanks, Max.
 
•	FLETCHER
Mom? !
(under his
breath)
Himnm. . . I don't remember her
looking that good,
(becomes the
robot again)
Malfunction in Vector 4!
Malfunction in Vector 4!

Fletcher's other robotic arm becomes a "pincher", comes after Audrey.

AUDREY
(playfully)
Keep Vector 4 away from me.
Unless you want Vector 4
chopped off.

FLETCHER
You know, you were much easier
when we were married...
(re: her luggage)
So where are you off too?

AUDREY
Stanford.	I'm delivering a
paper.

FLETCHER
Oh really? Where I live, we
use a boy on a bike.

MAX
Hey mom, dad's taking me to
see wrestling!

AUDREY
(mildly
protesting)
Oh, Fletcher!

FLETCHER
(playfully
mimicking her)
Oh, Audrey!

AUDREY
Do you have to take him to
those things? They're so
violent.
 
Fleccher IMITATES the familiar wise, old INDIAN CHIEF DAN GEORGE.

FLETCHER/DAN GEORGE
The boy must learn the way of
the warrior. And who better
to teach him than Rowdy Rod- .
Piper and Big John Stud?

Audrey can't help but LAUGH.

FLETCHER/DAN GEORGE
He must be schooled in the way
of the face-claw, the sleeper-
hold, and the purple nuxple.
For only then--

AUDREY
(playfully)
Shut up!!

FLETCHER/DAN GEORGE
(to Max)
The squaw will never
understand us.

A HORN HONKS. It's the good-natured, affable JERRY. Max runs up to him.

JERRY
Max, my man!

Jerry gives Max "five", then kisses Audrey on the lips.

JERRY
Fletcher, good to see you?

FLETCHER
What? No kiss for me?

JERRY
(re: luggage)
What do you say, Max? Give me
a hand?

Fletcher grits his teeth as Jerry gives Max a piggyback ride to get the luggage.

FLETCHER
(to Audrey)
I didn't know the boyfriend
was going.
 
AUDREY
Jerry.	His name is Jerry and
yes, he's going.

Audrey heads inside.

INT. HOUSE - DAY	• .

Audrey enters, shuts the blinds.

FLETCHER
To Stanford? Overnight? Does
this mean you two are...
(cringes, can't
say the words)

AUDREY
I've been seeing him seven
months, what do you think?

FLETGHER
I was hoping that after being
married to me, you'd have no
more strength left.

AUDREY
. Well you have to remember when we were married, I wasn't
having sex nearly as often as
you were.

FLETCHER
MEDIC!! I've been hit.

Audrey locks up.
 

FLETCHER
Well, great... I'm so happy
for you two.	I am just Mister
Happy man. Happy, happy,
happy.

AUDREY
Relax, Fletcher.	It looks
like Jerry's taking that job
offer in Boston.

Fletcher turns sincere.

FLETCHER
Aud, I am so sorry...
 
Behind her back, he FLAILS in celebration. She glances back... He stops, whistles innocently.

JERRY
(calling to
Audrey)
Ready?

Audrey and Jerry say goodbye to Max. They get in his Explorer.

FLETCHER
(to Audrey)
You gonna be okay? Because if
not, we could leave Max with
your sister and I could go out
with you two, does that appeal
to you at all?

They drive off.

FLETCHER
Wave to the soon-to-be ex-
boyfriend, Max.
(flipping Max the
keys)
You drive.

INT. BMW - AFTERNOON'- MOVING

Fletcher is driving, Max beside him.

MAX
Dad, are we really going to go
to wrestling?

FLETCHER
Absolutely, Maxattacker. We
just have to stop by the
office for one minute.

Max SIGHS. He's heard this before.

EXT. SKYSCRAPER - AFTERNOON

Establishing the headquarters of ALLAN, STEWART &
KONIGSBERG.

As they head inside, Fletcher and Max pass a BEGGAR.

BEGGAR
 
'Scuse me, sir. Do you have
any change?
 
FLETCHER
(patting his
pockets)
'Fraid not. Sorry.

INT. SKYSCRAPER LOBBY - AFTERNOON

Fletcher grabs The Daily Journal, paying for it with a HANDFUL OF CHANGE. His son takes this in.

On their way to the elevators Fletcher and Max pass PHILIP, a dweebish bore.

PHILIP
Fletcher!

FLETCHER
Philip!

PHILIP
And this must be Max!

FLETCHER
(trying to brush
him off)

.	Yes. Yes it is. Well, it was good seeing you--

Fletcher starts off with Max, when Philip calls after him.

PHILIP
You know, Ethel and I had a
blast at our last little get-
together.

FLETCHER
Oh, me too.	I can never get
enough of charades. We'll
have to do it again sometime.

Fletcher heads into an open elevator... only to find the door's closing impededby Philip's foot.
 


When?


Soon.
 


PHILIP


FLETCHER

 
The door again begins to close... when Philip stops it.

PHILIP
How 'bout tonight?
 
FLETCHER
Not that soon.	I'm taking Max
to see wrestling--

PHILIP
We love wrestling.	We could--

FLETCHER
I don't think so.	See, Max is
really shy around strangers.

Max looks up at Fletcher.	He isn't.

FLETCHER (CONT'D)
Tell you what -- give me your
card as a reminder.	I'll call
you. Soon. Promise.

PHILIP
Great!

Philip hands him his card just as the door closes.

INT. ELEVATOR - AFTERNOON

Max watches as his father TEARS PHILIP'S CARD IN TWO. INT. RECEPTION AREA OF LAW OFFICES - AFTERNOON

The receptionist, JANE, greets them. Jane has an ODD, UNATTRACTIVE HAIRDO. A large GIFT BASKET is on her desk.

JANE
Hi, Mr. Reid.
(indicates, her
hair)
What do you think?

FLETCHER
Fabulous!	I love it.
(indicates the	•
basket)
What's this?

JANE
I don't know who sent it. But
it's for Mr. Allan.	It's his
anniversary.

FLETCHER
 
Ah... The Partnership
Committee meeting still
scheduled for Friday?
 
JANE
(as she goes)
Yep...

Fletcher quickly removes a gift card from his pocket, scribbles on it, puts it in place of the one already there

MAX
What are you doing?

FLETCHER
Oh, I'm... fixing the card,
(shows him the
old card)
Look, they spelled Mr. Allan's
name wrong. Have an apple.

INT. MIRANDA'S OFFICE - AFTERNOON

...Where a troubled FRED RAND is talking to MIRANDA, a beautiful, steely partner.

FRED
I can't do it.

MIRANDA
Fred, it's your duty to
present the strongest case
possible.

FRED
The strongest case possible,
consistent with the truth.

MIRANDA
Let the Judge decide what's
true. That's what he gets
paid for. You get paid to
win.

FRED
If you insist on my taking it
to trial, I'll represent Mrs.
Cole aggressively and
ethically.	But, Miranda -- I
won't lie.

Miranda looks out her window, calculating.

MIRANDA
 
Then we'll just have to find
someone who'will.
 
INT. HALLWAY OF LAW OFFICES -- AFTERNOON

Fletcher strides through the hallway with Max, calling out GREETINGS to his colleagues.

FLETCHER
Hey, Pete! Great tie!	• .

Max looks at PETE, -whose fashion-disaster tie startles him.

FLETCHER
Thomas--looks like you're
losin' weight.

THOMAS glances up from a file. Max notes that he's corpulent.

THOMAS
Gained three pounds.

FLETCHER
(wedging past
him)
On you, it works.

•
Fletcher arrives at his office. WE MEET his secretary, the fiftyish, .worldly-wise and world-weary GRETA.

GRETA	'
Max! What's new?

.MAX
Well. . .	it's my birthday
tomorrow. We're having a
party and everything.

Fletcher's EYES WIDEN. He has clearly forgotten.

GRETA
I'm sure your dad'11 give you
something wonderful.

Fletcher tries to wave her off, awkwardly stopping when Max
turns to him.	.

MAX
Yeah?

FLETCHER
Oh, yeah. You're going to
love it. Uh, why don't you
play in my office for a
minute? Fax something, sue
someone, have a good time.
We'll be leaving in a second.
 
Max heads into the office. Fletcher closes the door behind him turning it into a silly, two-handed wave.

FLETCHER (CONT'D)
Damn!	I completely forgot.

GRETA
Oh, there's a surprise.

Greta produces a wrapped GIFT.

FLETCHER
You're a saint.	I should get
you something.

GRETA
You did.

She holds up another, smaller package.

FLETCHER
Ah. Well, I always do the
classy thing. Any calls?

•
She hands him a stack of mail.

GRETA
. Let's see.. .	•
(checking
messages)
Judge Patterson's clerk. He
needs your filing.

FLETCHER
Tell him it's in the mail.

GRETA
(jotting down a
note)
Right. You'll do it next
week. Mr. McKinley phoned,
questioning that fourteen
hours you billed on Christinas
Eve.

FLETCHER
Write him a long, explanatory
letter. Then bill him for the
letter.

GRETA
 
(jotting down a
.	note).	. .

Done. Your mother called.
 
FLETCHER
I ' m  on vacation.

GRETA
This is your fifth week.	.	•	.

FLETCHER
It's a long vacation.

GRETA
(jotting down a
note)
"Break mother's heart." Done.
And that's it, except
Miranda's looking for you.

FLETCHER
(checking watch)
As if I don't have anything
better to do than bow and
scrape at her royal perfumed
partner feet. Tell her I'm in
court.

GRETA
Court's closed.

FLETCHER
Tell her I broke my leg and
had to be shot.

GRETA
(whispers)
Why don't you tell her
yourself?

As Miranda approaches, Fletcher switches gears in an instant:

FLETCHER
--And then send out a notice
of judgement on my win today!

GRETA
(dry)
I'll get right on it.

Fletcher turns -- and pretends to be surprised.

FLETCHER
 
Miranda!	I didn't see you.
Hey, you look lovely, today.
Here, I bought you a gift.
 
He grabs Greta's gift and hands it to Miranda.

MIRANDA
Thanks.	I heard about your
victory today.	You're making
quite an impression on the
partnership committee.

FLETCHER
(feigning
puzzlement;
then)
Oh, that's right.	You folks
are meeting again soon.
"Allan, Stewart, Konigsberg,
and Ried." There's something
about the rhythm of fours.
It's like a full measure.
Well, anyway, I've got a
client waiting in my office--

MIRANDA .
Actually, something important
has come up. You're not busy
tonight, are you?

Before Fletcher answers, we:

CUT TO:

INT. FLETCHER'S OFFICE - EVENING

A sad Max sits on Fletcher's big sofa. His heart sinks further when Fletcher enters. . . carrying two boxes of documents.

MAX
We're not going, are we?

FLETCHER
Of course we are. A promise
is a promise. We are gonna
see wrestling or my name isn't
Fletcher T. Reid.
 
FLETCHER
(to wrestler)
Could you hand me that?
(the wrestler
does)
Thank you.
(without looking
up)
We are having some fun, eh
Maxer?

PUSH IN on Max; he isn't.

•INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Jerry paces. Audrey is on the phone, waiting. She notices Jerry pacing.

AUDREY
Are you alright?

JERRY
Uh, yeah, just, uh... how long
are you gonna be on the phone?

AUDREY
I just wanted to say good-
night to Max, but he must
still be out with Fletcher,
(hangs up)

JERRY
(suddenly)
Will you marry me?

She's SHOCKED.

I

AUDREY
Uh...would I . . . ?  What did you
say?

JERRY
(nervous)
I proposed, I . . .  Look, I know
this Boston thing is a great
opportunity, good job,
money... everything. But I
started to think about being
three thousand miles away from
you and Max. And I didn't
like it.	I-- Look, I know
it's a lot to ask, to move and
everything, but I . . . . I love
 
you.	I love your son.	Will
you marry me?

She stares at him, excited, but nervous.

EXT. HIGH RISE APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING

Early morning outside Fletcher's building.

INT. FLETCHER'S STUDY - MORNING

Fletcher types on his computer.	He's been up all night.

He leans back, rubs his eyes. When he opens them he sees Max standing there in pajamas. Fletcher SMILES.

FLETCHER
Max Factor... Happy birthday.
How old are you today?
Thirty? Forty?

MAX
Five.

FLETCHER
Well, you've held up well.	I
only wish there was some way
to commemorate such an
occasion, some small symbol to
mark this day, like....

Fletcher produces --

FLETCHER
. . .	A present!	.

Max eyes it with wonder.

MAX
What is it?

FLETCHER
(no idea)
It's... it's.
(it hits him)
a surprise.

Max knows his father doesn't have a clue but he rips the box open, revealing, a BASEBALL, GLOVE, DODGER'S CAP, and
FULL MAJOR LEAGUE STYLE UNIFORM.

MAX
Baseball stuff!
 

 
_ J

FLETCHER
Baseball stuff.

MAX
(hugging his dad)
Will you play catch with me?

:	FLETCHER	' •
Absorootentootenlutely.

Max beams.

FLETCHER
Tonight. After your party,
you have my word on it.

Max nods sadly as Fletcher turns back to his work.

EXT. JERRY'S CAR - MORNING

Jerry and Audrey are driving. Audrey's holding a couple of airline tickets.

AUDREY
(re: tickets)
Jerry, these are for tomorrow.

JERRY
The company wants me to get
started right away.

AUDREY
I can't just pick up and move
to Boston with two days
notice.

JERRY
Just come check it out. You
and Max, see the town. Let's
. pick out a place together.
Then, if you want to turn me
down and scar me for life,
fine.

AUDREY
It's just not that simple...
What about my job? I've been
at UCLA three years.

JERRY
It's New England. They're
lousy with colleges. You
can't swing a bat back there
without hitting a college.
 
You'd get a job there in a
second.

AUDREY
There are other factors
involved.
(points)
There they are now.	• .

They pull up in front of Fletcher's building where Fletcher and Max are waiting. Fletcher's still reviewing a file.

As Audrey gets out of Jerry's car, Max runs over.

AUDREY
Did you have fun?	How were
the wrestling matches?

FLETCHER
Big fun. Manly fun. Am I
right, Maxie?

MAX
(half-heartedly)
It was fun..

•
FLETCHER
(re: Audrey)
So how were the wrestling
matches?	Did you have fun?

JERRY
Max, my man! My happy
birthday man!

Max and Jerry exchange "fives" and'a hug. Jerry gives Max a light punch on the arm.

JERRY
One-two-three-four-five... and
one for good luck.

FLETCHER
Did you see that? He struck
the child!

MAX
Look what dad got me!
(shows the glove)

JERRY
Whoa! Great!	I have my glove
in the car. We'll stop in the
park on the way home and play
catch. Then tonight we'll oil
 
it, wrap a rubber band around
it. . .	It'll be great.
(to Fletcher)
Great birthday present, dad!

Fletcher hates him.	Jerry and Max go to Jerry's car.

FLETCHER	• .
(makes a fist)
When is it his birthday?

AUDREY
Something's come up. We need
to talk.

MAX
Mom, let's go.	I want to
play.

AUDREY
(to Fletcher)
We'll talk tonight.
•
FLETCHER
Tonight?

AUDREY
Max's birthday?

FLETCHER'
Oh, yeah, right. Seven.	I
knew that.	I did.	I blocked
it out weeks ago. The
seventeenth of May. Max's
birthday.

AUDREY
It's the eighteenth.

FLETCHER
The seventeenth of May is the
day I .remind myself that the
eighteenth is Max's birthday.
See you tonight.

They drive away.

INT. MIRANDA'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Miranda, and Fletcher's new client, VIRGINIA COLE, an alluring woman in her early thirties/ review the document he spent the previous•night putting together.
 
VIRGINIA
This is good. This is really
smart.

FLETCHER
Thank you.

VIRGINIA
Only i t ' s . . . Like not true.
Every word of it is a lie.

Fletcher and Miranda exchange glances.

VIRGINIA (CONT'D)
I mean... isn't that a
problem?

FLETCHER
Mrs. Cole, the only problem
here is that after you've
provided years of faithful
service and loving support, of
raising his children -- They
are his?

VIRGINIA
Hm? Oh yeah. One for sure.

FLETCHER
After all that, your husband
wants to deny you a fair share
of the marital assets based on
one single act of
indiscretion--	]

VIRGINIA
Seven.

FLETCHER
Hm?

VIRGINIA
Seven single acts of
indiscretion.

FLETCHER
--Seven acts of indiscretion,
only one of which he has any
evidence of, and all of which

he himself is responsible, for.

VIRGINIA
He is?
 
FLETCHER
Mrs. Cole, I stayed up all
night last night studying your
case. Not just your case...
but you. And, by now, I feel
I know you.	You are the
victim here.	The wife of a
cold, distant businessman.
Starved for affection, driven

into the arms of another man--

VIRGINIA
Seven.

FLETCHER
(not missing a
beat)
--Seven .other men.	You're not
trying to deny him what is
rightfully his. All you're
insisting on is what is
rightfully yours. And maybe
an idgy-smidgy bit more.	I
think you're bending over
backwards.

VIRGINIA
Well, I did agree to give him
j oint custody of the kids...
(to Miranda)
He's always been a good
father.

FLETCHER
And you've always been a good
wife.

VIRGINIA
(getting worked
up)
Yeah. . .

FLETCHER
There's such a thing as being
too nice. That's why you need
aggressive representation. To
show the court that there is
more than one side to this
story. All I'm asking is the
opportunity to see that
justice is done on your
behalf.
(takes her hand)
Will you give me that
opportunity?
 
He stares into her eyes. A moment, then...

VIRGINIA
Yes!	I' m tired of getting
kicked around.

FLETCHER
Good for you!

VIRGINIA
Thank you, Mr. Reid.	I 'm  so
grateful I have an attorney I
can trust.

She gives him a HUG and momentarily grabs his ass. With a farewell nod to Miranda, she leaves.

Miranda turns, smiles at Fletcher, then shuts the door.
She moves in on him.

MIRANDA
You're good. You're really
good.

FLETCHER
Oh, pshaw.
(pronounces it
with the "p")

She picks a piece of lint off.his jacket.

MIRANDA
No, I mean it. The Cole case
is worth a truckload of money
to this firm, not to mention
the press it's going to
generate. You win this case
and I guarantee you'll make
partner.
(straightening
his tie)
Actually, how would you like
to make a partner right now?

FLETCHER
Excuse me?

She grabs his lapels and pulls him in for a deep KISS.

INT, AUDREY AND MAX'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
 

A PARTY in progress, KINDERGARTNERS being entertained by a MAN in a clown suit and clown make-up.
 
CLOWN
(singing)
Captain Fuzzy is my name,
Making children happy is my
game,
With a shake and a juggle,
And a big belt buckle,
You'll all be glad I came. '

He flops down on his back causing something in his pants to HONK. Audrey and Jerry watch.

AUDREY
(indicating the
clown)
What do you think?

JERRY
Well, if you don't hire your
brother, who will?


She heads into...	.

INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

•
JERRY
They called me again from
Boston. They really want me

JERRY

Max.
 


AUDREY

 
JERRY
He'll love it there.

AUDREY
It's Fletcher.

JERRY
Fletcher?

AUDREY
I can't move Max three
thousand miles away from his
father.
 
JERRY
Audrey, I have never said a
bad word about your ex --

AUDREY
I know.

JERRY
But how much responsibility
does Fletcher take for Max,
now?	He'd never come over if
you didn't remind him.

AUDREY
I know. But if they're three
thousand miles apart they'll
never see each other.
Fletcher will never come to
Boston and how can I send Max
cross-country to him?

.JERRY
So because your ex-husband is
unreliable, we can't-'-

AUDREY
I know, it's not logical, it's
emotional.	I'm sorry.

Pause.

JERRY
I still want to marry you.

AUDREY
Are you sure?

Jerry picks up the PHONE, pulls out a piece of paper, dials.

JERRY
(into phone)
Mr. Crisitelli, Jerry
She!ton... I hope I'm not
calling too late... Mr.
Crisitelli, I'm afraid I have
to turn down your offer..'. So
am I . . .  Well, I've fallen in
love with this beautiful woman
in L.A. and she doesn't want
to leave and I won't leave
without her... Well, thank you
very much... Yes, good-bye.
 
(hangs up)
He wasn't there, but that's
1	the speech I would've made.

She smiles and KISSES him. The PHONE RINGS. Audrey answers.

AUDREY
Hello...

INTERCUT WITH:

INT. MIRANDA'S OFFICE - NIGHT

AUDREY
Fletcher, where are you?
We're getting ready to cut the
cake.

FLETCHER
Urn, actually, something has
come up. A problem on a new
caaa--	.

Miranda bites one of Fletcher's nipples.

FLETCHER
A-h-h-h-!

AUDREY
What happened?

FLETCHER
Nothing.	I just nailed my
•knee into the desk... Listen,
I'm really sorry I can't 'make
it.

AUDREY
Max is going to be so
disappointed.

FLETCHER
I'll make it up to him, I
promise.	I'll pick him up
from school tomorrow, okay?

AUDREY
Do you want me to put him on
the phone?

Miranda starts "reeling in" the phone cord.

FLETCHER
Ah, no.	I have to go.
 
AUDREY
Right.

ANGRILY, she hangs up. Fletcher stares UNHAPPILY at the phone, before Miranda THROWS HIM BACK ONTO THE COUCH.

INT. AUDREY AND MAX'S DINING ROOM - NIGHT

WE PAN DOWN from banners reading HAPPY BIRTHDAY, MAX!. . . to a room full of guests... to a desultory five-year-old.

Audrey finishes lighting the candles on the homemade cake.

AUDREY
All right, birthday boy, make
a	wish.

Max doesn't respond.

AUDREY (CONT'D)
C'mon, honey.	It can be
anything-- whatever you want
most in the world.

When he .doesn't respond, she leans down to him..

AUDREY (CONT'D)
Max, your dad is sorry. He
had to work.

MAX
He said he was coming. He
promised.

AUDREY
Yes, well, he... promises
he'll see you tomorrow.

Max doesn't believe it.	<

He turns his full attention to the candles on the cake. In VOICE OVER we hear what she does not.

MAX (V.O.)
I wish, for just one day, Dad
couldn't tell a lie.

He takes a breath --and blows out all the candles. A strange WIND blows the drapes and the wisp of smoke up, up, up... to the clock on the wall. It's 9:15.

CUT TO:

A clock on a wall.	It's 9:15'. We are--
 
INT. MIRANDA'S OFFICE - NIGHT

PAN around Miranda's office, where the displaced sofa is adorned with Fletcher's shoes...

To the credenza, where Fletcher's pants hang...

To the lamp, where Fletcher's shorts swing...

To the desk, where a ravished Miranda lies next to Fletcher. Superbly confident of the answer, she asks--

MIRANDA
S o . . .  was it good for you?

Without thinking, Fletcher responds in the most astonishing way possible-- he TELLS THE TRUTH.

FLETCHER
I've had better.

Miranda turns to him in disbelief -- but it's nothing compared to the LOOK OF SHOCK on Fletcher's face.

INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE MIRANDA'S OFFICE - NIGHT

The door opens -- and the naked Fletcher is forcefully kicked out. He goes TUMBLING over a desk as a RAIN OF CLOTHES follow.

The door SLAMS SHUT again, leaving him without his pants.

A CLEANING LADY stares at him in shock, then takes her broom, aims for his crotch, SWINGS.and. . .

INT. BEDROOM - FRIDAY MORNING

An alarm CLOCK RINGS. Fletcher BOLTS UP in bed. With regret and wonder he remembers:

FLETCHER
"I've had better?"

INT. FLETCHER'S BATHROOM - MORNING

Fletcher brushes his teeth, looks up at his reflection in the mirror, mouth foaming.

FLETCHER
"I've had better?!"

INT. HALLWAY OF FLETCHER'S APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING Dressed for work, Fletcher waits for the elevator.
 
FLETCHER
(laughing it off)
"I've had better?"

It arrives. He steps in.

INT. APARTMENT ELEVATOR - MORNING

The elevator is empty, except for Fletcher... and a beautiful young WOMAN.

FLETCHER
New in the building?

MODEL
I just moved in Monday.

FLETCHER
Ah. Well, you must allow me
to give you the grand tour.

MODEL
(she's
interested)
Oh? Do you do that for all
the new tenants?

FLETCHER
No. Just the ones I want to
bang like a drum.

Fletcher's face REGISTERS extreme SHOCK and...

INT. LOBBY OF APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING

We HEAR a SMACK off camera and a PING as the elevator door opens. The model storms off and A STUNNED Fletcher steps out, rubbing his freshly slapped face.

EXT. COURTROOM -, MORNING

A SHAKY Fletcher strides toward the courthouse... when he is accosted by a BEGGAR.

BEGGAR
Any change, Mister?

.FLETCHER
Absolutely.

But he continues walking.

BEGGAR
Could you spare some?
 
FLETCHER
Unquestionably.

Fletcher walks faster, PUZZLED that he has answered truthfully. The beggar is even more puzzled.

BEGGAR
Will you?

FLETCHER
No.

BEGGAR
How come?

FLETCHER
Because I resent your
presence. You fill me with an
unpleasant mixture of disgust
and guilt.	Further, I don't
believe you'll use the money
for food, but I believe you'll
use it for, at worst, drugs,
or, at best, whiskey, or
. cigarettes. Also, I'm cheap.

As Fletcher heads up the stairs...

BEGGAR
Jerkoff.

INT. COURTROOM - MORNING

A winded Fletcher joins Virginia at the respondent's table,

VIRGINIA
You look like you're having a
rough morning.

FLETCHER
I've had better.

He WINCES as he recognizes the words. Then, an extremely wealthy, respectable industrialist, RICHARD COLE enters with his attorney, DANA APPLETON, young, brisk, confident.

DANA
Good morning, Fletcher.

FLETCHER
Dana.	"
 
RICHARD
All right, Virginia, how much
will it take to put an end to
this?

FLETCHER
Fifty per cent of your estate.

Richard is SHOCKED.

DANA
Fifty per cent? With a pre-
nup and proof of adultery?
What's your case?

FLETCHER
Our case is simply this. . .

Fletcher opens his mouth to enlighten her -- but he CAN'T GET THE WORDS OUT. He tries to FORCE OUT SOUNDS, but succeeds only in looking like a fish gasping on dry land.

DANA	.
Interesting, though based on
your track record, I expected
a little more.

Nearing panic, Fletcher whirls to his BRIEFCASE and grabs the brief.

FLETCHER	..
Wait! Wait!	I've got it in
writing!

But when Dana tries to take the document, the astonished Fletcher finds himself PHYSICALLY UNABLE TO RELEASE IT.

DANA
Let go!

FLETCHER
I'm trying!

He INVOLUNTARILY snatches the document away and IT PULLS HIM to a nearby TRASH CAN where he throws it out.

At this moment the BAILIFF calls.

BAILIFF
 
All rise for the Honorable
Judge William Stevens.
 
DANA
Very funny, Fletcher. You
want to play hardball, I'm
game.

JUDGE STEVENS takes the bench.

JUDGE STEVENS
Calling case BA 09395, Richard
Cole versus Virginia Cole.
How're we doing this morning,
counsel?

DANA
Fine, thank you.

JUDGE STEVENS
And you, Mr. Reid?

FLETCHER
Well, I'm a little upset about
a bad sexual episode I had
last night--

Fletcher screeches to a standstill, suddenly aware of what he just said. After an awkward silence--

JUDGE STEVENS
(dryly)
Well, you're still young.
It'll happen more and more.
In the meantime, what do you
say we get. down to business?
First, Mr. Reid, I see that
your client was previously
represented by Mr. Rand of
your office.

FLETCHER
Yes, Your Honor.

JUDGE STEVENS
I take it you're seeking to
substitute in as counsel?

FLETCHER
Yes, Your Honor.

JUDGE STEVENS
Fine, fine. And for the
record, the reason is?
 
FLETCHER
Mr. Rand had severe ethical
objections to my client's
case.

Fletcher is incredulous. Somehow his greatest asset in the world, his mouth, has become his worst enemy.

JUDGE STEVENS
I take it you don't share the
same ethical objections, Mr.
Reid?

FLETCHER
I have lower standards, Your
Honor.

JUDGE STEVENS
I see. Well, if Mrs. Cole
wants the substitution of
counsel, I'll allow it.	Is
that what you want, Mrs. Cole?

Virginia looks to the judge, then to Fletcher, whose unorthodox syle seemed so brilliant earlier.

VIRGINIA
(unsure)
Yes?

JUDGE STEVENS
Fine.

VIRGINIA
(aside, to
Fletcher)
What are you doing?

FLETCHER
(worried)
I don't know.	.
(to judge, with
some
desperation)
Your Honor, I'd like a
continuance!

JUDGE STEVENS	"
This case has already been
delayed several times, Mr.
Reid.
 
FLETCHER
I realize that, Your Honor,
but I ' d really, really, really
like a continuance.

JUDGE STEVENS
I'll have to hear good cause,
counselor.	What's the
problem?

FLETCHER'S P.O.V.

The ROOM begins to SPIN slowly -- then faster -- then faster -- until we wind up squarely on --

FLETCHER'S FACE

FLETCHER
I can't lie!

JUDGE STEVENS
(impatient)
Commendable, Mr. Reid, but I'm
still waiting for the good
cause. Now, do you have it or
. not?

'	FLETCHER
(truthful)
Not.

JUDGE STEVENS
Motion for a continuance
denied.	Is there any chance
of a settlement in this case?

DANA
I don't think so, Your Honor.
Mr. Reid made it abundantly
clear that the last thing in
the world he wanted was to --

FLETCHER
(desperate)
SETTLE! SETTLE! SETTLE!

Dana and Mr. Cole look at Fletcher with surprise.

JUDGE STEVENS
There appears to have been a
change in strategy. Let's go
to my chambers and negotiate.

He BANGS the gavel.
 
INT. JUDGE STEVENS'S CHAMBERS - MORNING

Dana and an apprehensive Fletcher sit before the judge

DANA
Your Honor, under the terms of
the prenuptual agreement, if
Mrs. Cole commits adultery,
she is entitled to nothing.
We have in our possession an
audiotape made by a licensed
private investigator of an
explicit act of sexual
congress with a man who is not
her husband.

JUDGE STEVENS
Sounds pretty damning, Mr.
Reid.

FLETCHER
It certainly does.

DANA
However, my client has no
desire to see his ex-wife
destitute. Against my advice,
he's willing to offer her a
cash settlement of.two point
four million dollars.

JUDGE STEVENS
Two four seems like a pretty
fair offer, Mr. Reid.

FLETCHER
Fantastically fair.
Phenominally fair.	In fact,
I'd say beyond fair, bordering
on stupid.

Dana fumes. The judge finds Fletcher's boldness refreshing.

JUDGE STEVENS
What are you suggesting, Mr.
Reid? That Ms. Appleton's
willingness to proffer such an
offer betrays a lack of faith
in her position?

FLETCHER
(utterly sincere)
No, not at all. She's got my
client dead to rights. When
 
attorneys go to sleep at
night, they dream of having a
case as strong as hers.

DANA
Can the sarcasm, Reid.	All
right, I admit it -- I've seen
you make even the lamest case
fly.	But this time I have
you.	Even Clarence Darrow
couldn't explain this away.

She brandishes the audiotape.

JUDGE SAMIOAN
Well, Mr. Reid? without a
dynamite explanation, I'd say
you're dead in the water.
How's you client's story?

FLETCHER
The best that money can buy,
Your Honor.	•

JUDGE STEVENS
Strong corroborating evidence?

FLETCHER
We have evidence that you are
not going to-believe.

Despite herself, Dana is beginning to look worried.

JUDGE STEVENS
You're pretty confident how
this trial is going to come
out, eh, Mr. Reid?

FLETCHER
(hopeless) .
"Confident" is too weak a
word, Your Honor.	I am
certain what will happen if I
take this puppy to trial. The
verdict will be a stunning,
humiliating defeat that will
cut a spectacularly promising
legal career off at the knees.

Fletcher is referring to himself, of course, but Dana thinks he's speaking about her. She buckles.
 
DANA
All right!	Double the offer!
Four point eight! And not a
penny more.
(venomous, to
Fletcher)
Bastard!

She storms out, leaving an astounded Fletcher behind.

JUDGE STEVENS
You are some negotiator, Mr.
Reid.	If your client has half
a brain, she'll jump at the
offer.

CUT TO:

VIRGINIA
No!

We are --

INT. COURTROOM - MORNING

Fletcher has joined Virginia at the respondent's table

FLETCHER
No?! Mrs. Cole, this offer
was a miracle.	I'm talking
about a walking-on-water,
Lazarus-rising-from-the-dead,
find-no-line-at-the-friggin'-
DMV miracle!	You've gone from
two point four to four point
eight million in...
(checks his
watch)
four minutes. Think of it
this way -- now you're getting
paid seven hundred thou per
schtupp!
•	•	•
VIRGINIA
Mr. Reid, you convinced me
yesterday -- I'm the victim
here, starved for affection,
driven into the arms of
another man--
 

FLETCHER
Seven!	•
 
VIRGINIA
--	Seven other men. With the story you came up with, I don't think I can lose. I want to proceed.

FLETCHER
Mrs. Cole, you don't	• .
understand, I--

But before Fletcher can finish, the judge enters.

JUDGE STEVENS
Well, Mr. Reid. Do we have a
settlement?

Fletcher looks pleadingly at his client, but she is firm.
He shakes his head unhappily. The judge is irritated.

JUDGE STEVENS (CONT'D)
There's no settlement. Trial
to start at one-thirty sharp.

He BANGS the gavel. Fletcher emits an involuntary whimper. INT. HALLWWAY OF LAW OFFICES - MORNING

DAZED, Fletcher makes his way down the hall. Jane comes toward him wearing a hairstyle that resembles a nest. He tries to avoid her, but...

JANE
What do you think?				
FLETCHER .				
I think you need help.				
HORRIFIED, Fletcher hurries on. The heavyset Thomas	•	
ambulates in his way.	•	-

Fletcher speeds past--

Hi, boss. What's happening
with--

FLETCHER
DON'T ASK! FOR GOD'S SAKE,
PLEASE DON'T ASK!

-- And races into his office.

INT. FLETCHER'S OFFICE - MORNING

He leans against the door, trying to catch his breath.

•
FLETCHER,
(pacing)
Don't panic. You can beat
this — it's all a matter of
willpower.

He dives for his desk and rifles through it.

FLETCHER
A test. . .	Something small...
Aha!

He holds up a BLUE PEN.

FLETCHER (CONT'D)
Red.	Red.	All right.	Focus,
(with great
deliberation)
The color of this pen is • r--.
R--. R--!	The color of this
pen is--blue!	AAAAHH!
(burying his
head)
 
Ahhhh! One' tiny lie and I
can't say it!!
 
(suddenly sitting
up)
' I'll write.it!

He takes a sheet of PAPER, his pen and writes "This pen i s . . . " He tries to write an "R" but can't. He STRAINS. STRAINS HARDER. He's out of his chair, on the desk. His feet KICK OVER OBJECTS on the shelves'behind him. He finally forces pen to paper. He looks down where he wrote inadvertently:

"This pen is blue."

FLETCHER
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO! ! ! !

Greta enters to find--

FLETCHER running around the office, shaking the blue pen in the air.

GRETA
Boss, what's wrong?

FLETCHER
. The pen is blue!! The pen is	.
blue!!	The GODDAMN PEN IS
BLUE!!!

Almost weeping, he collapses into a chair. A moment -- then Greta tentatively offers him a red pen.

GRETA
Red?

FLETCHER
(bitter)
Oh, that's easy for you to
say?!

GRETA
Are you all right?

FLETCHER
(getting up)
I have to go home.

GRETA
Home? Was the case settled?

FLETCHER
 
No.	I have to be in court at
one-thirty.
 
GRETA
Well, then how can you.go
home?

FLETCHER
I don't know, I don't know!!!

GRETA
Okay.
(walking on
eggshells)
Before I forget -- Rubin and
Dunn called. They want to
know where the Darvis
settlement offer stands.

FLETCHER
I only proposed a settlement
to dick with them. I never
had any intention of going
through with it.	.

Not certain why her boss would .shoot himself in the foot, Greta nonetheless jots down his remarks.

GRETA
'•...dick with them." Okay.
Your accountant, Philip,
called to remind you about
getting together.	.

FLETCHER
I'd rather shave my ass and
sit in vinegar..

GRETA
(jotting down a
note)
Got it. And your mother
called again. Are you still
on vacation?

FLETCHER
(emphatically
nodding "yes")
No.

GRETA
So then you're here?

FLETCHER
(emphatically
shaking his head
"no")
Yes.
 
GRETA
I 'm having a little trouble
following you. what do I say
to your mom?

FLETCHER
(resigned)
Tell her I'm a thoughtless son
who'd rather spend ten hours
clogging the wheels of justice
than five minutes talking to
her-- but only if she asks.
You.might also add that she
deserves better, though I hope
to God you don't.

GRETA
Thanks for clearing that up.
And that's it, except your ex
called and asked when you were
cowing over to see your son.

FLETCHER
(remembers)
OHH! I'M SUCH A SHIT!!

He reacts, particularly stunned by this truth. INT. VOLVO - MOVING / FLETCHER'S OFFICE - MORNING

Audrey is driving Max, who wears his new baseball uniform when her cellular PHONE RINGS. She picks it up.

We INTERCUT between car and office.

FLETCHER
Audrey--

AUDREY'
Hey, Fletcher. T was
wondering if you were going to
still pick up Max after school
today.

FLETCHER
I don't think I can. I had a
case I was certain would
settle and it didn't. I have
to go to trial this afternoon,
God help me.
 
AUDREY
(not believing
him)
Right.

FLETCHER
It's true... I really do want
to see Max, today.

Fletcher considers what he just said, realizes it is true.

FLETCHER (CONT'D)
How about that. I really do.

AUDREY
(cynically)
But things keep coming up at
the last minute.

FLETCHER
Yes, but-this time it's
different.

AUDREY
I see. And how is that?

FLETCHER
(he walked into
it)
This time I'm telling the
truth.

AUDREY
But last night you weren't?

FLETCHER
No.

AUDREY
What were you doing?

FLETCHER
Having sex.

AUDREY
(barely holding
her temper),
It must have been with someone
very "special."

FLETCHER
No.	It was with someone I
don't even like. But I
thought it would help my
career and at the moment that
 
seemed more important than
attending my son's birthday!

AUDREY

My God!!

She SLAMS DOWN the phone.

MAX
I wished that, for just one

FLETCHER
Answer, answer, answer...
 

INTERCUT WITH AUDREY'S CAR
 
AUDREY
Hello.

FLETCHER
Audrey, let me explain.
Something has happened to me--

AUDREY
Fletcher, something else is
about to happen to you.

FLETCHER.
What do you mean?

AUDREY
Max and I are moving to
Boston.

FLETCHER
What?!

AUDREY
Jerry asked me to marry him.
He wants Max and I to fly with
him this weekend to pick out a
house. And I'm going to go.
God knows I don't have any
reason to stay here.

FLETCHER
(panicking)	.
Wait, you can't move!	If you
take Max away... I'll
practically never see him.

AUDREY
Well then you'll have pretty
much the same relationship you
have with him now.

FLETCHER
Audrey, please.... Is this
because of what I just said on
the phone?

AUDREY
That was the straw and this is
the camel's back saying
goodbye.

FLETCHER
Where are you?

AUDREY
Heading home.
 
FLETCHER
When you gee there, stay
there.	I'll be right over.
We have to talk.

AUDREY
Fletcher--

FLETCHER
I'll be right- there!

He hangs up and heads for the door. It opens and Miranda enters.

FLETCHER (CONT'D)
Aaaah!

MIRANDA
Fletcher. Fletcher, Fletcher,
Fletcher.	I must confess--
after last night's incident, I
was. . .	hurt. So hurt. I was
tempted to do whatever little
things lie in my power to
scuttle your chances of making
partner.

Fletcher is FRIGHTENED.

MIRANDA (CONT'D)
But then I thought, "No,
that's not fair. Fletcher
didn't mean to insult me."
(straightening
his tie)
"It was just some massive,
boneheaded misunderstanding,
and Fletcher is very, very
sorry."

Fletcher smiles.	It looks like he's off the hook, until--

MIRANDA (CONT'D)
Isn't that right, Fletcher?

FLETCHER
(in agony)
Uh -- not really, no.

MIRANDA
(stunned, angry)
No? No?! What are you
saying? Have you no respect
for me?!
 
FLETCHER
None, whatsoever.	I mean, I ' d
like to respect you, and if it
weren't for your mistreatment
of the associates, your
rudeness to the staff, and the
fact that your work sucks, I
would.

MIRANDA
But -- what about last night?

FLETCHER
I was afraid you wouldn't
support my partnership if I
turned you down.	Plus, I have
an immature need for sexual
conquests.

INT. FLETCHER'S OFFICE - MORNING Fletcher rubs his freshly SLAPPED FACi.. INT. BMW - MOVING / EXT, STREET - MORNING

Fletcher speeds away. He pulls the blue pen from his pocket.

FLETCHER
Gotta focus. . .	gotta focus.

He's so preoccupied that he speeds through a crosswalk and almost hits an OLD MAN.

FLETCHER
The color of the pen is --
red!	.

But he hasn't regained the ability to lie -- he's referring to the RED LIGHT he just ran, nearly colliding with a truck. The DRIVER screams:

DRIVER
What's your problem, schmuck?!

FLETCHER
(the truth)
I' m an inconsiderate prick!
 
Fletcher once again focuses on the blue pen.

FLETCHER (CON "ID)
C'mon, you can do this!	The
color of the pen is -- RED!

This time he's referring to the flashing red light of a POLICE CAR in his rearview mirror.

FLETCHER
Shit!!

Fletcher pulls over. A POLICE OFFICER strolls up.

POLICE OFFICER
Do you know why I stopped you?

FLETCHER
Depends on how long you were
following me.

POLICE OFFICER
Why don't we take it from the
top.

FLETCHER
•	(in agony)
Here goes -- I didn't fasten
my seatbelt, I didn't glance
in my rearview mirror, I
didn't signal when I pulled
away from the curb, I sped, I
followed too closely, I ran a
stop sign, I almost hit :a
Chevy Camaro, I almost hit a
geezer, I sped some more, I
failed to yield at a
crosswalk, I changed lanes in
the intersection, I changed
lanes without signalling, and
I changed lanes in the
intersection-without
signalling while running a red
light and speeding.

A long moment.

POLICE OFFICER
May I see your driver's
license?

FLETCHER
No.
 
POLICE OFFICER
And why is that?

FLETCHER
It's in my other pants.

POLICE OFFICER
I see.	And where are your •
other pants?

FLETCHER
Hanging from my boss's
credenza.

POLICE OFFICER
Do you expect me to believe
that?

FLETCHER
No.

POLICE OFFICER
Do you think I'm an idiot?

FLETCHER
Yes -- but that's beside the
point! My license actually is
in my other pants, and they
actually were hanging from a
credenzaJ	I wouldn't lie to
you!	I mean, I would if I
could, but I can't!

POLICE OFFICER
I see.	So you ..have no reason
to try and hide your license
from me?

FLETCHER
I didn't say that.	I have
other reasons. Seventeen
reasons, to be precise.
(begrudgingly,
off the
officer's look)
Unpaid parking tickets.
(beseechingly)
Be gentle.

EXT. AUDREY'S  HOUSE - MORNING
 

A cab speeds up to the house. Fletcher runs out. Audrey is headed to her car.
 
FLETCHER
Audrey, wait!

AUDREY
Wait? You know, I just had an
insight into myself.	I 'm
crazy.	You call me up and .
tell me to wait here because
you'll be right over and --
here's the crazy part -- I
actually wait.

FLETCHER
I can explain--

AUDREY
I missed a department meeting.
I. . .  Did you come in a cab?

FLETCHER
Yes.

AUDREY
Where's your car?

EXT, POLICE IMPOUND YARD - MORNING

Audrey finishes paying the impound-yard CASHIER and joins Fletcher, who is waiting alongside hundreds of towed cars.

FLETCHER
Thank you. . I can't tell you
how much this means to me.

AUDREY
I can. One thousand, six
hundred, and fifty-four
dollars and eleven cents.

FLETCHER
Ow.

At this moment WE HEAR a hideous scraping noise -- and a TOW-YARD EMPLOYEE whips Fletcher's BMW into view and. parks... revealing a prominent new scrape on the door.

FLETCHER (CONT'D)
You scratched my car!

TOW-YARD EMPLOYEE
Where?	.

FLETCHER
Right there!
 
TOW-YARD EMPLOYEE
Oh that? That was already
there.

FLETCHER
(outraged)
Why, you -- you liar!	Do you
know what I' m going to do
about this?

TOW-YARD EMPLOYEE
What?

FLETCHER
(angrier and
angrier)
...Nothing! Because if I take
you to small-claims court, it
will just drain eight hours
out of my life, and you
probably won't show up, and if
I finally got the judgment
you'd just stiff me anyway, so
what I'm gonna do is piss and
moan like an impotent jerk and
. then bend over and take it up the tail pipe!

TOW-YARD EMPLOYEE
You've been here before,
haven't you?

He flips Fletcher the keys and goes.

AUDREY
Well I can't remember when
I've had more fun, now if
you'll excuse me, I have a
class.

She starts out.

FLETCHER
Audrey, wait.	I want to talk
to you about this Boston
situation.

. AUDREY
What do you want to say?

FLETCHER
You can't go.	It's not fair.
Taking Max three thousand
miles away is not fair.
