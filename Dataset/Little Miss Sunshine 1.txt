ECU - VIDEO PIXELS

Five young women stand side by side, waiting to be judged -- breathless, hopeful. A name is announced. Four hearts break.

The camera ZOOMS across the smiles of the losers to find a winner. She bursts into tears, hugs the nearest runner up.

Begin CREDITS.

MUSIC -- quiet and melancholy -- plays over all the opening scenes, leading to the Title card.

The Contest Winner cries and hugs the Runners-up as she has the tiara pinned on her head. Then -- carrying her bouquet -- she strolls down the runway, waving and blowing kisses.

INT. BASEMENT REC ROOM - DAY

A	six-year-old girl sits watching the show intently. This is OLIVE. She is big for her age and slightly plump.

She has frizzy hair and wears black-rimmed glasses. She studies the show very earnestly.

Then, using a remote, she FREEZES the image.

Absently, she holds up one hand and mimics the waving style of Miss America. She REWINDS the tape and starts all over,

Again, Miss America hears her name announced, and once again breaks down in tears -- overwhelmed and triumphant.

RICHARD (V.O.)
There's two kinds of people in this
world -- Winners... and Losers.

INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

RICHARD (45) stands at the front of a generic community college classroom -- cinderblock walls, industrial carpeting.

He wears pleated khaki shorts, a golf shirt, sneakers. He moves with the stocky, stiff-legged gait of a former athlete. His peppy, upbeat demeanor just barely masks a seething sense of insecurity and frustration. MUSIC continues underneath.

RICHARD

If there's one thing you take away
from the nine weeks we've spent, it
 
should be this: Winners and Losers.
What's the difference?

Richard turns with a remote and clicks through a Power Point presentation, projected on the wall behind him.

The slides mimic Darwin's "Evolution of Man" chart, except that they show a lumpy, hunched-over, sad-sack "Loser" evolve into a smiling, triumphant, arms-over-his-head "Winner".

RICHARD
Winners see their dreams come true.
Winners see what they want, they go
out and they get it. They don't
hesitate. They don't make excuses.
And they don't give up. Losers don't
get what they want. They hesitate.

They make excuses. And they give up.
On themselves and their dreams.

Richard puts down his remote for the big finale. In the dim half-light, it's a hushed, dramatic moment.

RICHARD

Inside each of you -- at the very
core of your being -- is a Winner
waiting to be awakened... and

unleashed upon the world. With my
nine step "Unleash the Winner Inside"
program, you now have the tools, the
know-how, the insights you need to
put your losing habits behind you

and make your dreams come true. No
hesitating! No excuses! I want you

to go out into the world... and be
Winners!

Big smile.

REVERSE ANGLE -- There are twenty STUDENTS in a classroom that could seat two hundred. They CLAP half-heartedly.

Then there's an awkward moment when everyone gathers their stuff. No one says anything. Chairs SCRAPE the floor.

SHERYL (V.O.)
...Yeah, I'm on my way now.

INT. CAR	-	DAY		
A woman,	SHERYL, 40s,	is smoking and talking on a	cell phone
as she	weaves through	a strip-mall landscape. She	wears office
attire	and	a name tag	that reads, "Sheryl".	

SHERYL
...I don't know how long... I don't
know...! Richard, he doesn't have

anywhere else to go!
 
She takes a drag, listens with increasing irritation, then exhales. A beat.

SHERYL

I'm not smoking... I'm not! Look,
I'm at the hospital...
(beat)

Yeah, I'll pick up a bucket of
chicken. Okay, bye.

She beeps off her phone.

EXT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY

Sheryl strides anxiously down a hospital corridor, fingering

a small cross on her necklace, going from one room to another, checking room numbers. She finds the room she's looking for.

As she tries to enter, a DOCTOR emerges. They nearly collide.

DOCTOR
Ms. Harvey?
(Sheryl nods)
Your brother's fine...

Sheryl exhales, hugely relieved.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

In a wheelchair, parked against a wall, is Sheryl's brother, FRANK, also middle-aged. His wrists are wrapped in bandages.

With empty eyes, he listens to the muted VOICE of the Doctor coming from the hallway.

DOCTOR (O.S.)
...Keep him away from sharp objects:
knives, scissors... If you have
medications -- depressants -- in
your house, keep them secured...

INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY

Sheryl listens to the Doctor.

DOCTOR
I'd prefer to keep him, but...

SHERYL

I	know, the insurance...

She shakes her head and sighs.

DOCTOR

You want to see him...?

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

Sheryl and the Doctor enter. Frank barely reacts.
 
SHERYL

Hey, Frank...

FRANK
Sheryl.

Fighting tears, she goes and hugs him.

SHERYL
I'm so glad you're still here.

FRANK
Well. That's one of us.

INT. BATHROOM - DAY

Two hands spill a brown powder onto a small mirror.

A razor blade cuts the powder into lines.

A rolled-up dollar bill lowers. The lines are snorted.

The snorter lifts his head up. He is a short, chunky, balding old man -- a Roz Chast kind of grandfather.

This is GRANDPA, 80 years old.

He sits down on the toilet seat, rubs his nose, takes a breath and relaxes as the drugs flood his system.

INT. DWAYNE'S BEDROOM - DAY

DWAYNE is a handsome, skinny fifteen year old with a mohawk.

He lies on his back in his bedroom, bench-pressing a barbell.

The bedroom is dominated by a huge portrait of Friedrich Nietzsche, painted on a bed sheet, hanging on one wall.

JUMP CUTS:

Dwayne does vertical sit-ups on a wall-mounted brace.

Dwayne does vertical push-ups leaning against the wall.

Dwayne breathes heavily, having finished his work-out.

He walks to a home-made calendar on the wall made from a long roll of computer paper. It is marked, "Enlistment."

On the roll is a long grid of maybe a thousand squares. About half the squares have been filled in with magic marker.

Dwayne uncaps a magic marker and fills in one more square.

INT. CAR - DAY

Sheryl drives Frank home from the hospital. They say nothing.
Sheryl sneaks glances at Frank. Hesitantly:
 
SHERYL

You want to talk? Or no?

Frank stares at the road in front of them. Finally:

FRANK

No.

SHERYL
Okay.

She nods. They keep driving.

FADE TO BLACK

TITLE:	"LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE"

MUSIC ENDS.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

An empty kitchen. A phone and answering machine sit in the FOREGROUND. The message light is BLINKING.

In the background, through a doorway, the front door opens.
Sheryl and Frank enter carrying several bags and suitcases.

SHERYL

(calling out)
Hello! Anyone...?!

INT. HALLWAY - DAY

She leads Frank down a hallway. He follows passively.

SHERYL

Down here. We have you with Dwayne.

She knocks and pushes open the door to Dwayne's room. Dwayne is on the bed, reading THUS SPOKE ZARATHUSTRA. He sits up.

SHERYL
Dwayne? Hi, Uncle Frank's here,

Frank hesitates. He gives Sheryl a look: "You're kidding."

SHERYL
He doesn't mind, Frank. We talked.

Frank makes a half-gesture towards the rest of the house.

SHERYL
We can't have you sleeping alone.
The doctors said...
(he looks at her)
I'm sorry. I have to insist.

Dwayne gets up and exits the room, pushing past them and
 
avoiding eye contact. Sheryl enters the bedroom.

INT. DWAYNE'S BEDROOM - DAY

Sheryl goes and brushes off a cot. Frank remains outside.

SHERYL

You'll get along fine. He's really
quiet. Look, I set up a cot.
(he hesitates)
Please, Frank? Please?

Very unhappily, Frank enters the room and just stands there.

SHERYL
Thank you. I gotta start dinner.
Come out when you're settled? And

leave the door open. That's important.
(beat)

I'm glad you're here.

She gives him a kiss on the cheek, then departs.

Frank sits on the cot in his nephew's bedroom. On it is a Muppet sleeping bag with the Cookie Monster eating a cookie.

Frank glances at the sleeping bag, then averts his eyes.

This is pretty much the worst moment of his life.

INT. DINING ROOM - DAY

Dwayne is at the dinner table, reading.	Sheryl walks by.

SHERYL
Dwayne, honey, there's a bucket of
chicken in the car. Can you get it

and I'll make a salad?

Dwayne silently gets up and departs, and the chaotic ballet of dinner preparations in the Harvey household begins. Sheryl opens the door to the downstairs rec room and shouts.

SHERYL

Olive?!

OLIVE (O.S.)

Yeah?!

SHERYL
Is Grandpa with you?!

OLIVE (O.S.)
Yeah!

SHERYL
What are you guys doing?

OLIVE (O.S.)
 
Rehearsing!

SHERYL
Okay! Dinner in ten minutes!

OLIVE (O.S.)
Okay!

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Sheryl enters, opens the refrigerator, and begins pulling out stuff to make a salad.

Abruptly, from the kitchen side door, Richard enters.

RICHARD
Hi.

SHERYL

Hi.	Frank's here.

RICHARD

Oh. Did Stan Grossman call?

SHERYL
Check the machine.

He walks over and hits the answering machine.

MACHINE
Hello. You have one message.

It rewinds. Dwayne enters holding a bucket of KFC.

SHERYL
Just put it on the table, hon. And
can you set the table? We'll do paper

plates tonight. I'll get cups and
napkins.

Dwayne nods and departs. Sheryl exits in the other direction.
The phone message begins.

JEFF (O.S.)

Sheryl, hey, it's Jeff. Listen, great
news. You know, when Olive was down
here last month, she was runner up

in the regional Little Miss
Sunshine...?

RICHARD
(calling to Sheryl)
It's from Jeff.
(to himself)
Fuck!

He stalks off. The MESSAGE plays to the empty kitchen.

JEFF (O.S.)
 
(filtered)
...Well, they just called me and

said that the girl who won had to
forfeit her crown. I don't know why --
something about diet pills -- but
anyway, that means Olive won the
regionals, so now she has a place in

the State contest in Boca. They want
to make sure she can make it, so I
said you'd call them...

Sheryl re-enters. She tries to listen to Jeff's message.

JEFF (O.S.)

...The woman's name is Lauren
Henderson and her number...

BEEEEP. The machine cuts him off. Sheryl, not understanding, shakes her head and returns to making her salad. Richard re-enters, picks up the phone and dials. Over the following, Dwayne comes in and out, picking up stuff to set the table.

RICHARD
(into phone)
Richard Harvey for Stan Grossman.
Can you reach him...?! Yeah, tell
him I want to know this thing is

done -- I'm waiting for the numbers.
No, I understand that. I understand.
Look, he has my cell, if he could
just call me anytime over the weekend
and let me know we're on, I'd be

very, very grateful. Okay. Thank
you. Bye.

He hangs up.

RICHARD
Bitch.

SHERYL
Richard...! So what happened with
Stan Grossman?

RICHARD
He's still in Atlanta.

SHERYL
So why hasn't he called you?

RICHARD
Will you let me worry about this?!

Sheryl exhales, goes back to her salad. Dwayne comes in.

SHERYL
Dwayne, can you check on Frank? Tell

him it's dinner time.
 
Dwayne nods and heads off. Sheryl walks back to the door to the downstairs rec room and opens it again.

SHERYL

Olive?! Dinner time!

OLIVE (O.S.)

Okay!

INT. DWAYNE'S BEDROOM - DAY

Frank sits on the cot, staring at a photo in his wallet (we can't see it). FOOTSTEPS approach. Frank puts the photo away.

Dwayne appears in the door, knocks, and mimes eating.

FRANK

Dinner?
(Dwayne nods)

What? You don't talk anymore?
(Dwayne shakes his
head)

Why not?

Dwayne rolls his eyes and half-shrugs.

FRANK

You can talk. You just choose not
to?

Dwayne nods. Then he points to the bed-sheet painting of Nietzsche hanging on his wall. Frank turns and looks.

FRANK

Is that Nietzsche? You don't speak
because of Friedrich Nietzsche?

Dwayne nods, turns and leaves. Frank considers this.

FRANK
Far out.

INT. DINING ROOM - DAY

Dwayne sits in his chair, folds his arms, and -- scowling -- waits for everyone else to arrive. Frank tentatively follows. Sheryl comes out and puts her salad on the table.

SHERYL

Frank, you can sit here, next to
Dwayne. Here's the salad. I'm gonna
run get Sprite for everyone.

She walks off, pausing to open the rec room door again.

SHERYL
Olive! Come on! Dinner time!

OLIVE (O.S.)
 
Coming!!!

Sheryl disappears, leaving Dwayne and Frank alone. Frank sits. Dwayne scowls at the table in front of him.

Frank looks at his place setting -- a paper plate and a Big Gulp cup with the Incredible Hulk on it. He picks up the cup and examines it dispassionately. He puts it down.

Dwayne doesn't move. Frank glances at Dwayne, not knowing what to do. He seems to have met someone who is at least as unhappy as he is.

This intrigues him. He ventures:

FRANK
Got a girlfriend?

Dwayne looks at Frank, then shakes his head.

FRANK
Boyfriend?

Dwayne gives Frank a look.

FRANK
Kidding. Kidding. I know.
(beat)
So who do you hang out with?

Dwayne shakes his head.

FRANK
No one? There must be someone...!

(Dwayne shakes his
head)
You don't hang out with anyone? Oh

come on. You must have one friend!

Dwayne reaches in his back pocket and pulls out a palm-sized pad of paper. He flips it open and scribbles a note.

He shows it to Frank. It reads:

"I hate everyone."

FRANK

Everyone? What about your family?

Dwayne scribbles again. He shows it to Frank. It now reads:

"I hate everyone!!!"

He's underlined "everyone" three times. Frank looks at him.

FRANK
You hate me?

Dwayne considers this. He scribbles a new note. It reads:
 
"Not yet."

FRANK

Fair enough.

They go back to sitting in silence. Richard comes out.

RICHARD

Frank. Good to see you.

FRANK

Richard...

They shake. Richard sits down. Silence. Richard stands up.

RICHARD

I'm gonna get Olive.

He walks to the downstairs doorway and shouts.

RICHARD

Dad! Olive! Come on!

OLIVE (O.S.)
(shrieking)
We're coming!!!

Sheryl enters with a big bottle of Diet Sprite.

SHERYL
You guys, go on and start. Frank,
some Sprite? I want everyone to have
at least a little salad.

FRANK
Thanks, Sheryl.

She pours him a cup, sits down, and starts opening containers of cole slaw and mashed potatoes.

Richard returns to the table, sits, and grabs a piece of chicken from the bucket. Dwayne follows suit, as does Frank.

The meal begins. Three seconds of silence.

FRANK

So, Sheryl... I couldn't help notice
Dwayne has stopped speaking.

SHERYL
Oh! I'm sorry. Dwayne's taken a vow
of silence.

FRANK
You've taken a vow of silence?!

Dwayne nods.
 
SHERYL
He's gonna join the Naval Academy

and become a fighter pilot. He's
taken a vow of silence until he
reaches that goal.

FRANK

(to Dwayne)
You're kidding...!

Dwayne stares at Frank. He's not kidding. Olive enters the dining room, with Grandpa following.

OLIVE

Hi, Uncle Frank!

FRANK

Olive. Boy, you're gettin' big!
(to Sheryl)

Is she big for her age?

Sheryl nods. Olive, unprompted, walks over and gives him a kiss on the cheek. She sees the bandages on Frank's wrists.

OLIVE
What happened to your arms?

SHERYL
Olive...

FRANK
No, it's okay. I had a little
accident. I'm okay now.

RICHARD
How's the new routine coming?

OLIVE
It's good.

RICHARD
When're you gonna let us see it?

OLIVE

I dunno. It's up to Grandpa.

GRANDPA

A couple of days. It needs a polish.

Olive sits. Grandpa walks to the table.

GRANDPA

What is this?! Chicken?! Every day
it's the chicken! Holy God almighty!
Is it possible, just one time, we
could have something for dinner except
the goddamn fucking chicken?!

Sheryl ignores him. Richard tries to cut him off.
 
RICHARD

Dad... Dad... Dad... Dad!!!

GRANDPA
I'm just saying...!

RICHARD
If you want to cook or buy your own
food, you're more than welcome...

GRANDPA

Christ. Y'know, at Sunset Village...

RICHARD
If you liked Sunset Village so much
maybe you shouldn't have gotten

yourself kicked out of there...!

GRANDPA
(waves dismissively)
Ahhhh...!

He takes out a piece of chicken and starts eating. A tense silence. Frank tries to get things going again.

FRANK

When did you start? With the vow?

Dwayne shrugs. He doesn't care to comment.

RICHARD

It's been nine months. He hasn't
said a word. I think it shows

tremendous discipline.

SHERYL

Richard...

RICHARD
I'm serious! I think we could all
learn something from what Dwayne's

doing! Dwayne has a goal. He has a
dream. It may not be my dream, or
your dream, but still... He's pursuing
that dream with focus and discipline.
In fact, I was thinking about the

Nine Steps...

GRANDPA
Oh, for crying out loud...!

RICHARD
(evenly)
...About the Nine Steps, and how
Dwayne's utilizing at least seven of
them in his journey to personal

fulfillment.
 
SHERYL
Richard. Please.

RICHARD

I'm just saying! I've come around! I
think Dwayne deserves our support.

Frank looks at Dwayne. Dwayne rolls his eyes. Olive addresses Frank.

OLIVE
How did it happen?

FRANK

How did what happen?

OLIVE

Your accident...

SHERYL
Honey...

She shakes her head: "Don't go there."

FRANK
No, it's okay. Unless you object...

SHERYL
No, I'm pro-honesty here. I just
think, you know...	It's up to you.

FRANK

Be my guest...

SHERYL
Olive, Uncle Frank didn't really
have an accident. What happened was:

he tried to kill himself.

OLIVE
You did? Why?

RICHARD
I don't think this is an appropriate
conversation.
(to Olive)
Let's leave Uncle Frank alone.

A beat. Olive has stopped eating.

OLIVE
Why did you want to kill yourself?

RICHARD

Frank. Don't answer that question.

Frank stares at Richard. He turns back to Olive.

FRANK
 
I tried to kill myself because I was
very unhappy.

RICHARD

(overlapping)
Don't listen, honey, he's sick and
he doesn't know what he's...

SHERYL

Richard... Richard... Richard...

RICHARD

What?! I don't think it's appropriate
for a six year old!

SHERYL
She's gonna find out anyway. Go on,
Frank.

OLIVE
Why were you unhappy?

Frank glances at Richard -- deadpan victorious -- and continues.

FRANK
Well, there were a lot of reasons.
Mainly, though, I fell in love with
someone who didn't love me back...

OLIVE
Who?

FRANK

One of my grad students. I was very
much in love with him.

OLIVE
Him? It was a boy? You fell in love
with a boy?

FRANK

Yes. I did. Very much so.

This is new to Olive. She thinks it over.

OLIVE

That's silly.

FRANK
You're right. It was very, very silly.

GRANDPA
There's another word for it...

RICHARD
Dad....

OLIVE
 
So... That's when you tried to kill
yourself...?

FRANK

Well, no. What happened was: the boy
I was in love with fell in love with
another man, Larry Sugarman.

SHERYL

Who's Larry Sugarman?

FRANK

Larry Sugarman is perhaps the second
most highly regarded Proust scholar
in the U.S.

RICHARD

Who's number one?

FRANK
That would be me, Rich.

OLIVE
So... That's when you tried...?

FRANK
Well, no. What happened was: I was a
bit upset. I did some things I
shouldn't have done. Subsequently, I
was fired, forced to leave my
apartment and move into a motel.

OLIVE
Oh. So that's when...?

FRANK
(hesitates)
Well, no. Actually, all that was
okay. What happened was: two days
ago the MacArthur Foundation decided
to award a "genius" grant to Larry
Sugarman.

(deep breath)
And that's when...

GRANDPA

...You tried to check out early.

FRANK

Yes. And I failed at that as well.

RICHARD

Olive, what's important to understand
is that Uncle Frank gave up on
himself. He made a series of foolish
choices, and then he gave up on
himself, which is something that

winners never do.
 
A beat. Frank looks like he could leap across the table and strangle Richard. Sheryl intervenes.

SHERYL

So that's the story, okay? Let's
move on. Olive, how's your new routine
coming?

OLIVE

Fine. I told you.

Over the above, Frank turns and asks, regarding Richard:

FRANK

Is he always like this?
(Dwayne nods)
How can you stand it?

Dwayne writes a note, shows it to Frank. It reads:

"I can't."

Frank nods. Richard addresses Olive.

RICHARD
Honey, tell Frank why you're doing
your dance routine.

FRANK

Olive. Why are you doing a dance
routine?

OLIVE
For Little Miss Crab-Cakes.

FRANK
(arch)
A-ha! Just as I suspected...!

SHERYL
Honey, tell him what Little Miss
Crab-Cakes is.

OLIVE

Little Miss Crab-Cakes is a beauty
contest for everyone in Maryland.
But you have to be six or seven years

old and you have to be a girl.

Frank looks skeptically at Sheryl.

SHERYL

Don't look at me! This is Jeff and
the new step-Mom. It's big down in
Florida

FRANK

(to Olive)
So what do you think your chances
 
are?

Olive takes the question like a pro.

OLIVE
I think I can win. 'Cause a lot of
the new girls -- they don't have the

experience.

FRANK
Well, good luck.

RICHARD
It's not about luck. Luck is the
name that losers give to their own
failings. It's about wanting to win.
Willing yourself to win. You got to

want it badder than anyone.

OLIVE
I do!

RICHARD
Do you? Really?
(a beat; she nods)
Then you're gonna be a winner!

She smiles. Dwayne shakes his head and keeps eating.

SHERYL
Richard...

RICHARD
What?! It's true!

OLIVE
I was runner up in Florida!

FRANK

When were you in Florida?

SHERYL

Spring break. Jeff had custody for
two weeks. Olive made it to the top
of the Regionals down there.

OLIVE

I was second place.

RICHARD
Sher, y'know, there's a message from
Jeff on the machine.

SHERYL

Yeah,	Did you hear what it was?

RICHARD

Actually, it was something about
Little Miss Sunshine.
 
OLIVE

What? Little Miss Sunshine? What?!

She runs off. Sheryl follows Olive into the kitchen.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Sheryl and Olive approach the answering machine. The "message"

light is blinking. Sheryl hits it.

JEFF (O.S.)

(filtered)
Sheryl, hey, it's Jeff...!

INT. DINING ROOM - DAY

Richard, Frank, and Dwayne try to listen, eating silently.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Olive and Sheryl listen.

JEFF (O.S.)

(filtered)
...Something about diet pills, but
anyway that means that Olive won the

regionals, so now she has a place in
the State contest in Boca...

BEEEP. Over the above, Olive reacts with involuntary spasms of shock, disbelief, and then pure, unadulterated euphoria.

She waits -- trembling — to hear the whole message. When it ends, she puts her hands to her temples:

OLIVE

Aaahhhhhhh!!! Aaahhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!
Little Miss Sunshine! Little Miss
Sunshine! Little Miss Sunshine!!!

She goes running out into the dining room.

OLIVE (O.S.)

Little Miss Sunshine! Little Miss
Sunshine! Little Miss Sunshine!!!

Sheryl closes her eyes.

SHERYL
Fuck...!

Sheryl picks up the cordless phone, dials.

INT. DINING ROOM - DAY

Sheryl re-enters with the phone. Olive is rejoicing.

OLIVE
 
I won! I won! I get to go to the
Championship! Oh, God! Oh, my God!

(beat)
I gotta pack! I gotta go pack!

She rushes off to the downstairs doorway and disappears.

RICHARD
Wait, Olive, finish your dinner!

OLIVE (O.S.)
I'm finished!

GRANDPA

What happened?

SHERYL

Apparently, the girl who won Regionals
was disqualified. So Olive has her

place in the Finals.

RICHARD

When are they?

SHERYL
I'm calling Jeff right... Jeff! Yeah,
we just got it... Yeah, she basically

went crazy. No, I didn't get that,
the machine cut you off.

She grabs Dwayne's pen and pad. She scribbles.

SHERYL
Uh-huh. In Boca Raton. This Sunday?!

Can you take her? You can't put it
off? No, it's just... We have to
figure this out. No, I'll give this

lady a call and we'll figure it out.
Right. Bye.

She hangs up.

RICHARD
It's Sunday? Can Jeff and Cindy take
her?

SHERYL

(shakes her head)
They're going to Maui.

They all look at each other.

INT. REC ROOM - DAY

We TRACK with Olive as she runs down a half-flight of stairs and races around, picking up clothes and shoes that are scattered about.

INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
 
Sheryl enters carrying the bucket of chicken, the half-filled containers of potato salad and slaw, and used paper plates.

Richard follows Sheryl. Grandpa follows Richard.

SHERYL

I have to go. I promised Olive I'd
take her if she made the finals.

RICHARD
You promised?

GRANDPA

I'm going.

RICHARD

Wait a minute, Dad...

SHERYL
We'll fly down, come back Monday.

Sheryl throws the plates in the garbage. Throughout the following, she wraps the leftover chicken in Saran Wrap and puts the chicken and other leftovers in the fridge.

RICHARD

How're you gonna get around down
there?

SHERYL
We'll rent a car.

RICHARD

And stay in a hotel?

SHERYL

We can afford it...!

RICHARD
Sheryl...! This is seed money!

SHERYL
Well, maybe if I had help bringing
it in, y'know?! It all goes to your
Nine Steps, which is not...

RICHARD
Honey...	Honey...	Honey...

(patient)
As soon as I hear from Stan, we'll
get the advance, I will pay you back,

we'll start generating revenue. But
in the meantime...

Sheryl exhales, grits her teeth, shakes her head.

SHERYL
Okay, we'll drive down.
 
RICHARD

In the Miata? How're you gonna fit
Grandpa?

SHERYL
Grandpa doesn't have to come.

GRANDPA

What...?! I coached her! I gave her
the steps! I have to be there!

RICHARD
Why don't you take the VW?

SHERYL
I can't drive a shift, Richard! I've
tried, and I can't do it!

Having put away the leftovers, Sheryl opens the freezer and pulls out a Jumbo Pak of popsicles.

SHERYL
We'll fly down.

RICHARD
We can't afford it.

SHERYL

Well, that's what we're gonna do!
Unless you have a better idea.

She slams the freezer door and heads for the dining room.

INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Sheryl enters. Richard and Grandpa follow. Frank and Dwayne are finishing up. Sheryl tosses the popsicles on the table.

SHERYL
Here. This is dessert.

She sits, rips open a popsicle and takes a bite. Silence.

Dwayne and Frank glance at each other, then tentatively take popsicles for themselves. Richard takes a deep breath.

RICHARD
Okay. I'll drive the bus.

GRANDPA
No! I'll take her on a plane!

Everyone ignores Grandpa. Sheryl considers Richard's idea.

SHERYL
What about Dwayne and Frank?

RICHARD
 
They can stay here.

Dwayne and Frank look at each other.

SHERYL
Richard. I was told explicitly I
could not leave Frank by himself. No

offense, Frank.

FRANK
None taken,

RICHARD
Well, I guess we can't go then! I
mean, unless we take Frank and Dwayne
with us!

A pause. All eyes turn to Frank and Dwayne. Dwayne begins vigorously shaking his head "No".

INT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - DAY

Olive re-enters with dresses, shoes, and her swimsuit. She pulls a suitcase from under her bed, opens it, and begins stuffing her things in.

INT. DINING ROOM - DAY

Sheryl pleads with Dwayne.

SHERYL
Dwayne, please. For your sister?

RICHARD

Come on, Dwayne! It'll be fun!

Everyone stares at him. Dwayne takes his pad out and writes.

Frank reads over his shoulder as it comes out.

FRANK
This... is... unfair... All... I...
ask... is... that... you... leave...

me... alone."

Dwayne stops writing, folds his arms. In the background, we HEAR Olive packing. Sheryl turns to Dwayne.

SHERYL
Dwayne: Flight school. I'll give

permission. Come on. It'll be fun.
You can go to the beach.

Dwayne looks at her. FOOTSTEPS start coming up the stairs. Finally, he offers his hand. Sheryl shakes. Everyone is relieved. Dwayne scribbles another note. Frank reads it.

FRANK

"But... I'm... not... going... to...
have... any... fun!!!"
 
He puts his hand on Dwayne's shoulder.

FRANK

We're all with you on that one,
Dwayne.

Olive re-enters, lugging her suitcase -- she is breathless, flushed with excitement.

OLIVE
Grandpa? Is Grandpa coming to Florida?

SHERYL

We're all coming.

RICHARD

Sheryl, wait. Olive, come here. Have
a seat.

Olive walks over and sits next to Richard.

RICHARD
Now there's no sense in entering a
contest if you don't think you're
gonna win. Now, do you think you can
win Little Miss Sunshine?

Sheryl starts to object, but Richard raises his hand, cutting her off. Olive doesn't seem so sure.

RICHARD

Yes or no, Olive. Are you gonna win?

Olive thinks it over.	Then, with white-hot determination:

OLIVE

Yes!

Richard smiles and slaps the table.

RICHARD

We're goin' to Florida!

INT. VW BUS - ON THE ROAD - DAY

Richard is driving. Sheryl rides shotgun. Frank and Olive sit in the second row. Dwayne and Grandpa sit in back.

Dwayne is wearing a T-shirt that says, "Jesus Was Wrong".

Olive wears a large set of headphones that completely cover her ears. She does little half-dancing moves to the music.

No one says anything. They've been driving a while.

Grandpa's arms hang limply by his side.

GRANDPA
 
Jesus, I'm tired. I am so fucking
(to Dwayne)

You know how tired I am? If some
girl came up to me... begged me to
fuck her... I couldn't do it. That's
how tired I am.

RICHARD
Dad! Your language...! Please!

GRANDPA
She's listening to the music...!
(loud)
Hey, Olive! I'll give you a million
dollars if you turn around!

Olive is oblivious.

RICHARD

Okay, but still, the rest of us...

GRANDPA

rest of you...
(to Dwayne)
Can I give you some advice?
(Dwayne shakes his
head)

I'll do it anyway. I don't want you
making the same mistakes I did when
I was young.

RICHARD

Great. I can't wait to hear this,

GRANDPA
Dwayne? This is the voice of
experience talking. Are you listening?

(Dwayne nods)
Kid: Fuck a lot of women. Not just
one woman. A lot of women. You're
young...

RICHARD
Okay, Dad? I think that's enough.

GRANDPA
(ignores him)
You gettin' any right now? Tell me,
really.

Dwayne shakes his head. Frank, amused, can't help but turn around to watch this conversation take place.

GRANDPA

Jesus! You're, what? Fifteen? You
should be gettin' that young stuff.
There's nothing in the world better

than the young stuff!
 
RICHARD
Okay, Dad, enough. Stop it!

GRANDPA

Would you kindly not interrupt me,
Richard?
(to Dwayne)

Look: right now, you're jailbait,
they're jailbait. So it's fine. The
minute you turn eighteen -- Bam!
You're lookin' at three to five.

RICHARD
Dad, I'm gonna pull over...

GRANDPA
So pull over! You're not gonna shut
me up! Fuck you! I lived 80 years!
You're like those fuckers at Sunset

Village...!

FRANK

What happened at Sunset Village?

SHERYL
Frank, don't encourage him.

GRANDPA
I'll tell you what happened! I pay
my money, they let me in. I should
be able to do what the fuck I want!

SHERYL
He started snorting heroin.

FRANK
You started snorting heroin?!

GRANDPA

I'm eighty!

FRANK

You know, that stuff'll kill you.

GRANDPA
What am I, an idiot?
(to Dwayne)

And don't you get ideas. When you're
young, you're crazy to do that shit.

FRANK
What about you?

GRANDPA

Me?! I'm old! You get to be my age --
you're crazy not to do it.

Frank looks at Sheryl -- You're letting this happen? Sheryl waves her hands, exasperated.
 
SHERYL

We've tried, believe me! He's worse
than a two year old. The intervention
was a fiasco.

RICHARD

Can we please talk about something
else now?

FRANK
So I take it you didn't like it at
Sunset Village?

GRANDPA
Are you kidding? Fucking paradise
there! They cook for you. Clean for

you. You got golf. A pool. Now I'm
stuck with Mr. Happy here, sleeping

on a sofa!

FRANK

Aren't there other places?

SHERYL
He keeps getting kicked out. Sunset
was number four.

GRANDPA

Motherfuckers.
(to Frank)
Hey, listen: I know you're a homo,

but... You go to one of these places?
There's four women for every guy.

What does that say to you?

FRANK

You must've been pretty busy.

GRANDPA
Oh, man. They were knockin' on my
door day and night! It was almost

too much! If I didn't have those
little fuckin' blue pills... Forget
about it!

Olive sees Frank grinning at Grandpa. She takes off her headphones and turns around.

OLIVE
What are you guys talking about?

GRANDPA
Politics.

OLIVE
Oh.

A beat. She puts her headphones back on.
 
GRANDPA

(to Dwayne)
Fuck a lot of women, kid. I got no
reason to lie to you. Not just one
woman. A lot of women.

INT. DINER - DAY

Everyone sits in a round booth, looking at menus.

OLIVE

Mom, how much can we spend?

SHERYL
I'd say four dollars. Anything under
four.

Olive nods. A WAITRESS arrives.

WAITRESS
Hi, you ready?

RICHARD

Yeah. Number five. And coffee.

SHERYL

Number seven, over easy. And
grapefruit juice.

FRANK
Fruit plate. And you have chamomile?
With honey. Thanks.

GRANDPA
The Lumberjack. Coffee. Extra bacon.

RICHARD
Dad...

SHERYL
Richard, don't start...

RICHARD

He's gonna kill himself...!

SHERYL

It's his life.

GRANDPA
Thank you, Sheryl.

She shrugs. Dwayne holds up his note pad.

WAITRESS
Garden salad? And you?

OLIVE
Urn... Sorry! I'm sorry!
 
WAITRESS

Take your time...!

RICHARD
Don't apologize, Olive. It's a sign
of weakness.

Frank rolls his eyes. Olive sees something.

OLIVE
Oh, oh! I want waffles. And... what
does "A la mod-ee" mean?

WAITRESS
It means it comes with ice-cream,

OLIVE
Okay! A la mod-ee!

SHERYL
Olive. For breakfast?

OLIVE

You said, "Four dollars"!

SHERYL

Okay, fine. You're right.

WAITRESS
Okay! Be right back!

She departs.

FRANK
Actually, Olive...? "A la mode" in
French translates literally as "in

the fashion". A... la... mode. Mode
is derived from the Latin "modus",
meaning due or proper measure. There's
kind of a funny story about...

RICHARD
(cutting in)
Frank...? Shut up.

SHERYL

Richard...!

Frank waves Sheryl off: don't bother. Richard turns to Olive.

RICHARD

Olive, can I tell you something about
ice-cream?
(she nods)
Ice cream is made from cream, which
comes from cow's milk. And cream has

a lot of fat in it...
 
SHERYL
Richard...

RICHARD

What? "She's gonna find out anyway."
Right?

OLIVE
Find out what?

RICHARD
Well, when you eat ice-cream, the
fat in the ice-cream becomes fat on
your body...

SHERYL
Richard, I swear to God...!

OLIVE

What? What's wrong?

SHERYL

Nothing, honey. Nothing's wrong.

RICHARD
So if you eat lots of ice-cream,

you're gonna become big and fat. But

if you don't, you'll probably stay
nice and skinny.

Sheryl puts her head in her hands.

GRANDPA
Olive, Richard's an idiot. I like a

woman with meat on her bones.

Olive is confused.

OLIVE

I don't... Mom! Why is everyone so
upset?

SHERYL
I'm not upset, honey. I just want
you to understand: It's okay to be
skinny, and it's okay to be fat, if
that's how you want to be. Whatever

you want -- it's okay.

Richard rolls his eyes.

RICHARD

Okay, but, Olive, let me ask you:
the women in Miss America...? Are
they skinny, or are they fat?

OLIVE

Well... They're skinny, I guess.
 
RICHARD
Okay! So they probably don't eat a

lot of ice-cream. Do they?

Just then, the waitress arrives with a tray.

WAITRESS

Okay: Coffee, coffee, grapefruit,
chamomile. And here's your ice-cream.

A	la mod-ee, right? I'll have your waffles in a sec!

She departs. Olive stares at the ice-cream. Finally :

OLIVE
Does anyone want my ice-cream?

Sheryl just closes her eyes. Grandpa jumps in.

GRANDPA
Yeah, I'll have a bite. You mind?
Dwayne? Frank? Olive's giving away

her ice-cream here.

Dwayne and Frank quickly snap to.

FRANK

You mind if I have a little?

Olive shakes her head. Frank and Dwayne dig in. Even Sheryl gets in on the act. Richard is not amused.

GRANDPA
(loudly)

Boy, this is good ice-cream! I feel
sorry for the people at this table
who aren't enjoying delicious ice-

cream early in the morning. Olive,
you're not givin' away all your ice-
cream? What about your waffles? You
can't eat waffles without the ice-
cream! You'll have lonely waffles in

your stomach! C'mon, have a bite.

OLIVE
Wait. Don't take it all! Stop!

Olive picks up her spoon, fights them off. She takes a bite.

RICHARD
Olive...

SHERYL
Richard...!

She glares at him, ferocious. Richard shuts up.

EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY
 
Richard -- anxious -- listens to a greeting on his cell phone.
A small BEEP.

RICHARD

(into phone)
Stan! Richard! Look, I know you're
busy, but we're dying to hear what

kind of numbers you came up with in
Atlanta. Call when you can.

He clicks off as Sheryl, Olive and the others exit the diner.
They trudge across the parking lot to the VW van.

SHERYL

You get him?

RICHARD

I can't get a signal out.

OLIVE
How long 'til we get there?

RICHARD
A long time.

OLIVE
I know, but... how long?

RICHARD

We're doing six hundred miles today,
and two hundred tomorrow. It's a lot
of driving.

SHERYL

Honey, I'll drive a while.

RICHARD

No, it's okay...

SHERYL
No, you're right. I gotta learn to
do this. I mean, you're doing it.

How hard can it be?

INT. VW BUS - PARKED - DAY

Sheryl is trying to back up the bus. She's grinding gears.

RICHARD

Push the stick down hard!

SHERYL

I'm pushing hard!

RICHARD
Put the clutch in all the way!

SHERYL
It's on the floor!
 
JUMP CUT TO:

Richard tries. He keeps grinding gears as well. It's a horrible sound.

INT. SERVICE STATION GARAGE - DAY

Richard and Sheryl talk to a MECHANIC.

Behind them, Olive and Grandpa are playing that game where you try to slap the other person's wrists. When Grandpa gets hit, he reacts with cries of pain -- much to Olive's delight.

In the background, across the lot, Dwayne and Frank sit on a cinderblock wall, waiting for the situation to resolve itself,

MECHANIC
Well, you got a problem. Your clutch

is shot.

RICHARD

Can we get a new one?

MECHANIC
Well, I tell you what: These old
buses? We'd have to order it.

RICHARD

How long'd that take?

MECHANIC

Well, it's the weekend, so... Maybe
Thursday?

Richard and Sheryl react.

EXT. SERVICE STATION - DAY

Frank and Dwayne sit silently. Dwayne watches bitterly -- this is just one more fiasco he's been dragged into.

Frank looks on wistfully as Sheryl -- thirty yards away -- glances worriedly between Richard and the Mechanic. Frank notices Dwayne's stare. He speaks without looking at Dwayne.

FRANK

I don't know if you know this, but
growing up? Your Mom was the cool

one. She turned me on to Proust. She
could've done anything.

Dwayne looks at Frank -- he can't quite believe this. He takes out his pad, half-smirking, and writes:

"What happened?"

Frank looks at the pad, then at Dwayne.
