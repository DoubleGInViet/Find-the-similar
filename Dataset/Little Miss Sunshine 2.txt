FRANK
She had you, Dwayne.

He pats Dwayne on the leg, gets up, and walks back towards Richard and Sheryl. Dwayne is left alone, taking this in.

INT. SERVICE STATION GARAGE - DAY

Frank wanders in as Richard presses the Mechanic. Grandpa and Olive stop their game and join the conversation.

RICHARD

Okay, looks we've come two hundred
miles... Is there a dealership around
here?

MECHANIC

Well, you could call over to
Clarksville, but they're probably

closed. Y'know, it's the weekend.

RICHARD

Yes, we're all aware of that.

Silence. The Mechanic feels bad for them. Dwayne re-enters,

MECHANIC

Well, I tell you what: these old
buses? You don't need a clutch to
shift from third to fourth. You just
ease up on the gas. You only really
need the clutch for first and second.

Richard doesn't understand what he's getting at.

MECHANIC
What I'm sayin' is: as long as you
keep parkin' on a hill, you get
yourself goin' fifteen, twenty miles
an hour, and you just start up in
third. Then you shift between third
and fourth.

RICHARD

And you can drive like that?

MECHANIC

Oh, yeah. The problem's just getting
up that speed up. As long as you

keep parkin' it on a hill, you're
fine. My brother and I once drove
from here to Canada...

RICHARD

What if you're not on a hill?

MECHANIC

What?
 
RICHARD
I mean, it's sitting here right now.

There's no hill. How do we...?

The Mechanic considers this. He squints his eyes and runs his tongue back and forth across his teeth.

MECHANIC
Well, I tell you what: You get enough
people -- you just get behind there
and push. Just push it up to ten,
fifteen miles an hour, and you just

go. Everybody jump inside, and you
just go!

They all stare at him.

EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

Richard's at the wheel of the bus. Everyone else, including the Mechanic, is behind the bus. The sliding door is open.

RICHARD
Okay, ready?! Olive, Dad: I want you
in the car first.

OLIVE

I know. We know.

RICHARD
Okay, is everyone ready?

SHERYL
Yes! Let's go!

Richard starts up the bus. Frank turns to the others.

FRANK
I just want everyone here to know
I'm the pre-eminent Proust scholar
in the United States.

RICHARD
Okay, go! Push!

They all push. The van starts rolling, slow at first, then faster and faster. Finally, they're all running behind it.

RICHARD

Olive, Dad, get in! Sheryl!

Olive, Grandpa, and Sheryl jump in the side door. The Mechanic fades. Frank and Dwayne keep pushing faster.

RICHARD
Okay, I'm puttin' it into gear! Get
ready!

He guns the engine and shifts from neutral to third. The bus
 
is REVVING low but is powering itself nonetheless.

SHERYL
Okay, get in! Get in!
(to Richard)
Slow down! You're losing them!

RICHARD
I can't! I can't slow down!

Dwayne runs up to the door. He sees Frank is fading.

He runs back to Frank, gets behind him, and pushes him up alongside the bus. Frank dives in. Dwayne dives after him.

INT. VW BUS - ON THE ROAD - DAY

Everyone cheers. Frank is panting. Dwayne shuts the door.

RICHARD
Is that it? Are we in?

FRANK
(to Dwayne)
"No one gets left behind! No one
gets left behind!" Outstanding,
soldier! Outstanding!

Frank salutes him. Dwayne smiles, embarrassed.

INT./EXT. VW BUS, ON THE ROAD - DAY - DRIVING MONTAGE

The VW drives down an on-ramp onto the Interstate.

The VW cruises down 1-95. Signs pass. Scenery goes by.

Inside the bus, everyone just stares out the windows.

Later, Grandpa is doing magic tricks for Olive. He produces a quarter from behind her ear and gives it to her.

Later, everyone is playing rock, paper, scissors.

Still later, everyone is back to doing nothing.

INT. VW BUS - ON THE ROAD - DAY

Richard is pitching his business to Frank, who is bored, but not as bored as he would be doing nothing. He is slouched down, barely moving. Richard, however, is in full sell mode.

RICHARD

...So I start pitching "The Winner
Inside" to Stan... Two minutes in,
he stops me, says, "I can sell this."

FRANK

Wow.
 
RICHARD
This is the guy who broke Tony

Robbins! He knows how to do it --
start with the book; media tour;
then corporate events, consulting,
videos series, direct buys on TV...
There's a science in how you roll

these things out.

FRANK
Interesting...!

RICHARD
So now he's at the Expo in Atlanta --
he's been hyping it up, building the
buzz -- he's gonna send it out, do a
ticking clock auction.

FRANK

How about that...!

RICHARD

And I can detect that note of sarcasm,
Frank...

FRANK
What sarcasm?!

RICHARD

...But I just want you to know -- I
feel sorry for you.

FRANK
You do? Good.

RICHARD
Because sarcasm is the refuge of
losers.

FRANK
It is?! Really?!

RICHARD
Sarcasm is just the sour grapes of
losers trying to pull winners down
to their level. That's one of the
lessons of Step Four.

FRANK

Wow, Richard! You've really opened
my eyes to what a loser I am! Say,

how much do I owe you for those pearls

of wisdom?

RICHARD

It's on me, buddy. It's on me.

SHERYL
Okay, you guys, enough. Frank, stop
 
it.

FRANK
(pointing)
"He started it!"

Even Sheryl has to laugh a little at this. Pretty soon, everyone in the back is giggling. Even Dwayne smiles.

SHERYL
You are bad! You are so bad!

FRANK
I know!

RICHARD
Yeah, go on and laugh. You're
whistling past the graveyard.

Richard maintains a steely composure. Then Richard's cell phone goes off: BEEEEP-BEEEEP. He checks the number.

RICHARD
There!	That's the call I've been
waiting for! Everybody, please!
Everyone...?!
(clicks the phone)

Stan! Hello...? Hello?! Hello?!

EXT. CONVENIENCE STORE / PHONE BOOTH - DAY

Richard is in a phone booth at a gas station / mini-mart. Everyone hangs out by the bus -- parked on a slight incline -- except Dwayne, who is doing push-ups on the grass nearby.

INT. PHONE BOOTH - DAY

Richard waits tensely.	Then -- abruptly -- he is "up".

RICHARD
Stan! Richard! Yeah, yeah, no problem!
So... What'd we get?

He listens. Gradually, his face falls.

BY THE VW -- Sheryl, Olive, Grandpa, and Frank watch Richard on the phone. Dwayne wanders back to the van.

SHERYL

Honey, I'm gonna use the ladies room.
You need to go?

OLIVE
No. I'm gonna practice my routine
over here.

SHERYL

Okay. Don't go too far.
 
They both wander off. Frank turns to Dwayne and Grandpa.

FRANK
I'm gonna get a drink. You guys want
anything?

Dwayne shakes his head, but Grandpa pulls out his wallet.

GRANDPA

Yeah. Get me some porn. Something
really nasty. None of that air-brushed
shit, alright? Here, here's a twenty.

Get a little treat for yourself too,
if they got any fag-rags in there.

Frank stares at Grandpa. Then, stoic, he takes the twenty and heads off. Dwayne and Grandpa turn back towards Richard.

INT. CONVENIENCE STORE - DAY

Frank stands at the counter, pointing out behind-the-counter magazines to a middle-aged Indian-American PROPRIETOR.

FRANK

That one. That one. And let's try
that one. No, down... Yeah, that
one. And a small grape Slushee.

By the front window, a good-looking YOUNG MAN is perusing the newsstand, cradling a grocery bag. He stops and stares.

YOUNG MAN

Frank...?

Frank turns. They are startled to see each other.

YOUNG MAN

Oh my God! What are you doing here?!

Frank puts his arms behind his back, hiding his bandages.

FRANK

I'm... on a trip. What about...? I
thought you were...

YOUNG MAN
...With Larry? Yeah, Larry bought a
beach house, right down the road
about -- I don't know -- about two

miles. We're having this big blow-
out tonight and he's all freaked
we're not gonna have enough booze.

He nods to his grocery bag, filled with bottles of Merlot.

FRANK
Larry's here...?!

YOUNG MAN
 
He's filling the tank. He's... Wow,
I can't believe this! How've you

been?

FRANK
Fine. I'm fine.

YOUNG MAN
Good. Good. You know, I heard...
Someone told me you got fired...?

FRANK

Yeah. No, I quit. I quit. Enough's
enough, you know?

YOUNG MAN
Right. Well, good. Good for you.
Cause you always seemed so... tense,
y'know?

FRANK
Yah.

YOUNG MAN

So what're you up to now?

FRANK

I'm... Weighing my options. You know.
Taking time off.

YOUNG MAN
Well, great. That's great,

The Proprietor puts three porn magazines and a grape Slushee on the counter and rings them up for Frank.

PROPRIETOR

$15.94, please, sir.

The Young Man glances at the magazines, then at Frank. Frank keeps his hands behind his back. An excruciating pause.

YOUNG MAN
Well, great seeing you again.

FRANK
Yeah. You too.

YOUNG MAN

Take care of yourself.

FRANK

You too.

The Young Man turns and exits. Frank hands over a $20 bill.

He watches the Young Man walk off while the Proprietor puts the magazines in a brown wrapper and hands Frank his change.
 
Frank takes a few steps and peers out the window.

HIS POV -- The Young Man gets into a Jaguar convertible driven by a distinguished-looking BEARDED MAN.

The Young Man says something and points back at the store.
The Bearded Man turns and cranes his neck.

Frank, in the store, ducks out of view. The Young Man and the Bearded Man exchange a few words, then shrug and laugh.

Then they drive off. Frank watches, heartbroken. Behind him, the Proprietor picks up the Slushee and waves it.

PROPRIETOR
Ay! Don't forget your Slushee!

EXT. PHONE BOOTH - DAY

Richard is grasping at straws.

RICHARD

Okay, Stan, wait, lemme interrupt
you... No, Stan, listen -- are you
in Atlanta? 'Cause I'm coming right
by you. Maybe I can swing by and...
No, Stan, listen...!

EXT. VW BUS - PARKED - DAY

Grandpa, standing by the bus, reads Richard's body language.
Richard, in the booth, talks with increasing desperation.

GRANDPA

He's not getting it. Christ.

He and Dwayne share a look. Grandpa turns away, troubled.

Frank walks stiffly back to the bus with his Slushee and the wrapper. Without looking, he hands the wrapper to Grandpa.

FRANK

How's it going?

GRANDPA
Not so good.

Sheryl walks back to the VW as Richard hangs up the phone.

Richard stays in the booth for a second. Then he exits the booth and walks back to the VW, passing Sheryl.

SHERYL
So what happened?

RICHARD
Nothing. Let's get out of here.

He walks to the driver's seat.
 
SHERYL

Wait a minute. I thought you said
this was a done deal.

RICHARD
He said it was a done deal.

SHERYL

You didn't get anything?
(beat)
So where does that leave us?

RICHARD

It leaves us fucked. That's where
us.

Pause.

SHERYL
I can't believe I'm hearing this.
Did you try negotiating...?

RICHARD

Yes, I tried! I tried everything!
What do you think...?! Let's just
go, okay? Let's get out of here!

He starts the car. She stares at him. He won't look at her.

Finally, he turns and yells:

RICHARD

Let's go!!!

Furious, she goes and gets in the bus, slamming the door.

Everyone else gets in. Richard releases the brake and they drift down the hill.

As the van rolls away, Richard shifts and GUNS the engine.

INT. VW BUS - ON THE ROAD - DAY

Silence. Everyone avoids everyone else's eyes. Finally, Frank glances around.

FRANK

Where's Olive?

EXT. PHONE BOOTH - DAY

Olive stands next to the phone booth.

In the distance, the VW bus appears.

It drives up and swings around the road.

Dwayne slides open the door. They barely slow down.
 
Olive dives in. The van coasts downhill.

Then Richard shifts into gear and GUNS the engine.

INT. VW BUS - ON THE ROAD - DAY

Richard drives. Everyone is tense except Olive, who listens to her headphones. Finally, Grandpa gets up and walks up to the front of the bus. He speaks quietly to Richard.

GRANDPA
Richard...

RICHARD

Yeah...

GRANDPA

Listen; whatever happens -- at least
you tried to do something on your

own, which is more than most people
ever do, and I include myself in
that category. It takes guts, and

I'm proud of you for taking the
chance, okay?

RICHARD
Okay, Dad. Thanks.

He tries to be cool and dismissive, but Grandpa just stands there. Finally, Richard turns and makes eye contact.

Awkwardly, he offers his hand to Grandpa. They shake.

RICHARD

Thanks, Dad.

INT. MCDONALDS - NIGHT

Everyone sits at a table eating. No one says anything.

EXT. MOTEL - NIGHT

With keys in their hands, they walk along the motor court, looking for their rooms.

SHERYL
Here's eleven. Frank, you're twelve?
And Grandpa's thirteen.

OLIVE
Mom? Can I sleep with Grandpa?

SHERYL
That's up to him.

OLIVE
Grandpa...?

GRANDPA
 
Okay. I got two beds. You could still
use some rehearsing...

OLIVE

I know! That's why I said...!

RICHARD

Everyone, we're getting up at seven.
I'll knock on your door. We want to
be on the road by eight so we can be
in Boca in time for registration.
It's two hundred miles, so we can't

dawdle.

SHERYL
Frank? You guys'll be all right?

FRANK
We'll be fine.

Dwayne nods. Sheryl kisses Dwayne and Olive.

SHERYL
Okay. Goodnight. Sleep tight.

Everyone waves goodnight to each other.

INT. MOTEL ROOM ELEVEN - NIGHT

Sheryl and Richard enter. Sheryl closes the door.

RICHARD

What a fucking nightmare...!

SHERYL
Richard... We have to talk.

RICHARD
Please, not now. Let's just get
through this and get home...

SHERYL

No, Richard. We need to talk now.

INT. MOTEL ROOM TWELVE - NIGHT

Dwayne lies on his bed staring at the ceiling. Through the walls we can HEAR Sheryl and Richard arguing very loudly.

SHERYL (O.S.)
You said it was a done deal!!!

RICHARD (O.S.)
Stan Grossman gave me his word!

SHERYL (O.S.)
I'm not married to Stan Grossman!

Jesus, Richard, what're we gonna do?
 
RICHARD (O.S.)
We just keep going...

SHERYL (O.S.)

I can't, Richard, it's too much!
It's too much, I can't take it!

Et cetera. Frank wanders out of the bathroom, squirting Rogaine on his head and rubbing his scalp. He watches Dwayne.

FRANK
Hey. Don't listen to that. Come on,
let's watch the tube.

He turns on the TV. Dwayne sits up and turns the TV off. He lies down, stares at the ceiling again. Frank looks at him.

FRANK
I'm gonna brush my teeth.

He turns and goes back to the bathroom.

INT. MOTEL BATHROOM - NIGHT

Frank enters, turns on the faucet, prepares to brush his teeth. He sees himself in the mirror and stops. A beat.

He opens up his wallet, pulls out the photo he looked at earlier, stares at it. Again, we can't see the photo.

He looks at himself in the mirror again.

INT. MOTEL ROOM TWELVE - NIGHT

The fight continues. Dwayne listens, scowling.

RICHARD (O.S.)

I trusted him, okay?! Step Three is
you have to trust people!

SHERYL (O.S.)
Fuck the Nine Steps, Richard! They're
not working! It's over!!! Forget
it!!! I never want to hear the Nine
Steps again!!!

A stunned silence. Dwayne, hearing this, just barely smiles.

INT. MOTEL ROOM THIRTEEN - NIGHT

Grandpa tucks Olive -- in pajamas -- into bed. It's quiet -- we can't hear Sheryl and Richard fighting.

GRANDPA

There you go. Snug as a bug in a
rug.

OLIVE
Grandpa...?
 
GRANDPA

Yeah?

She hesitates.

OLIVE

I'm kind of scared about tomorrow.

GRANDPA
Olive, you're gonna blow 'em out of
the water. I guarantee it. They won't

know what hit 'em.

She smiles. He's about to leave her when...

OLIVE

Grandpa...?

He turns back. She hesitates again. Something's really bothering her.

GRANDPA
It's okay. What's the matter?

OLIVE
I don't want to be a loser.

GRANDPA

You're not a loser, Olive! Why do
you say that?!

OLIVE
Because...! Dad hates losers. That's

what he said!

GRANDPA

But you're not a loser! And your Dad
would never hate you, ever!

OLIVE
But what if I lose tomorrow?

She's on the verge of tears. He takes her hand.

GRANDPA
Whoa, whoa, back up a second. You
can't lose. You know why? Because a
real loser isn't someone who doesn't

win. A real loser is someone who's
so afraid of not winning they don't
even try. That's not you! You're in

the contest! You're gonna dance! So
even if you win, or you don't win,
you've already won! See? You-see-you-
see-you-see?

He tickles her. She squeals. He stops, brushes her hair.
 
GRANDPA
I think we're gonna have fun tomorrow.

You think?
(she nods)
Okay. I'm gonna get ready for bed.
Goodnight. Sleep tight.

OLIVE
Don't let the bedbugs bite!

He gives her a kiss, turns off the lamp.

INT. MOTEL ROOM TWELVE - NIGHT

Frank re-enters from the bathroom wearing monogrammed silk pajamas, a sleeping mask on his head. Dwayne is in bed reading THUS SPOKE ZARATHUSTRA. Frank climbs into bed.

Dwayne sits up, looks at Frank,

FRANK
What?

Dwayne shows his pad of paper to Frank. It reads:

"Please don't kill yourself tonight"

Frank shakes his head.

FRANK
Not on your watch. I wouldn't do
that to you.

Dwayne nods, relieved. Frank pulls his sleeping mask over his eyes, lies back. Dwayne leans over, turns out the light.

INT. MOTEL BATHROOM - DAY

Grandpa enters and locks the door.

He opens his shaving kit and takes out a small mirror and a tiny ziploc baggie filled with light brown powder.

INT. MOTEL ROOM ELEVEN - NIGHT

Richard and Sheryl sit on opposite sides of the bed, not facing each other. It's quiet. They've hit rock bottom.

SHERYL

Maybe we should try living apart.
Just for a while,

Richard closes his eyes. This kills him.

Abruptly, Richard stands, gathers his keys, wallet, etc.

SHERYL

What're you doing? Richard...?
 
RICHARD
I'm gonna fix this.

SHERYL

Richard...

RICHARD

I'm gonna fix this. Don't worry.

He grabs his coat and exits, very determined. Sheryl, left behind, flops back on the bed.

EXT. MOTEL PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Richard strides to the VW bus, parked parallel on the street.

A small crowd of TEENAGERS is hanging out, smoking and drinking. Three Teen Boys are puttering around on mopeds.

Richard -- on a mission -- climbs in the VW's driver's seat and starts it up. He shifts into third and REVS the engine.

The VW doesn't move. He REVS it very high and loud, jostling in his seat to try to get the bus going. It stays still.

Richard takes his foot of the gas, slumps back.

The Teens stop chatting and stare at him. Richard, at the end of his rope, turns and looks at the Teens and their mopeds.

JUMP TO:

Richard walks up to the Teens on their mopeds. They are wary.

Richard smiles, tries to be friendly.

RICHARD

Hey! How would one of you guys like
to make twenty dollars?

The Teens look at each other.

TEEN BOY
Fuck off, fag.

This amuses the other Teens. Richard -- undeterred -- pulls out his wallet, opens it up to see how much cash he has.

RICHARD

Okay, look...

CUT TO:

EXT. HIGHWAY ENTRANCE - NIGHT - LONG SHOT

An empty highway entrance, lit by streetlamps. Interstate traffic flies by at 70mph -- cars, SUVs, eighteen wheelers.

Into the frame and down the entrance ramp rides Richard,
 
balanced precariously on a borrowed moped, pushing 35mph.

He edges into the break-down lane and drives parallel to the SWOOSHING traffic, a look of grim determination on his face.

He passes a sign that reads, "Atlanta, 23 Miles."

FADE TO BLACK

EXT. MOTEL PLAYGROUND - NIGHT

It's quiet. An empty children's playground sits near the motel, lit by a single streetlamp.

Sheryl lies on a platform swing, rocking back and forth, smoking a cigarette, staring up at the stars.

She looks at her wedding ring, jiggles it with her thumb.

FADE IN the WHINE of a moped.

EXT. HOTEL PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Richard pulls into parking lot of a large chain hotel. A marquee out front reads, "Life/Styles Expo. Welcome!"

INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - NIGHT

Richard comes in a side exit and strides down a long, carpeted hallway. Empty conference rooms line the hall.

Outside each conference room is an easel with a foam board mock-up of a self-help book cover. Richard walks past face after face of aspiring self-help gurus.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

Richard -- windblown, still in shorts and sneakers -- strides into a well-appointed lobby. A female CONCIERGE is on late-night duty. He walks to a courtesy phone, picks it up.

RICHARD

(into phone)
Stan Grossman, please. Thank you.

Through the receiver, we hear RINGING. Then VOICE-MAIL.

VOICE MAIL
(via phone)

The hotel guest you're calling is
not available. Please leave a message
at the tone.

BEEP.

RICHARD
Stan, it's Richard...

(at a loss)
I don't know where the fuck you are.
 
I'm at your hotel. Call me.

He hangs up and looks around, exasperated. He takes out his cell phone and dials. He puts the phone to his ear.

As the phone RINGS in his ear, we hear the synchronized BLEATING of a cell phone from the hotel bar nearby.

It takes Richard a second to make the connection. He turns.

In the bar/lounge, a boisterous group of CORPORATE TYPES -- prosperously attired men, meticulously groomed women -- are seated around a booth, drinking and laughing together.

Holding court is Stan Grossman, a swarthy mid-3Os go-getter wearing khakis, loafers, and a cashmere V-neck.

Richard watches as Stan pulls out his cell phone, checks the caller ID, shakes his head, puts the phone away.

Richard -- phone in his ear -- walks over and stands behind Stan Grossman, staring down at him. The Corporate Types stop laughing. Stan turns, looks up at Richard. Richard smiles.

RICHARD
Hi, Stan!

EXT. HOTEL PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Richard and Stan argue next to a dumpster in the parking lot behind the hotel. Richard's borrowed moped is parked nearby.

RICHARD
You said it would sell...!

STAN GROSSMAN
That's what I thought! At the time!

RICHARD

But it's a great program! You said
yourself! I don't understand...!

STAN GROSSMAN
It's not the program, Richard, it's
you, okay? No one's heard of you.
Nobody cares.

Richard exhales, shakes his head, gathers himself.

RICHARD
So what's the next step?

STAN GROSSMAN
There is none. We had our shot. It
didn't fly. We move on.

RICHARD

You mean give up.
 
STAN GROSSMAN
Richard...

RICHARD

One set back, you're ready to quit.

STAN GROSSMAN

Richard, listen -- I pushed this
thing hard, okay? I rammed it down
their fucking throats, all right? No
one bought it. Now, I know the market.
It's time to move on. You're not

gonna win this one.

Richard stares at Stan, absorbing this. Then he speaks with a strained nonchalance, nodding and smiling.

RICHARD
Okay...! Good! I'm glad. You know

why? This is what the Nine Steps are
all about...

STAN GROSSMAN
Richard! Jesus...!

RICHARD
You blew it, Stan. You're out.

Richard turns and walks off. Stan can't believe it. He watches Richard, shakes his head and re-enters the hotel.

Richard strides to the moped, looks both ways, climbs on and pedals furiously. The moped sputters to life.

EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

Richard, grim, rides his borrowed moped along the breakdown lane as cars and trucks ROAR past him.

This is -- hands down -- the worst moment of his life.

Then there's a FLASH of lightning and a CLAP of thunder. It starts to rain. Richard keeps riding.

INT. MOTEL - NIGHT

A darkened motel room. We hear the WHINE of the moped as it pulls into the parking lot and up to the door.

The door opens and Richard -- dazed, soaking wet -- steps in.

He closes the door behind him, walks over, lies on the bed -- fully clothed -- and stares up at the ceiling.

Sheryl, sleeping, wakes up and sees Richard.

SHERYL
Y'okay?
 
He nods. Sheryl rubs his arm, rolls over, goes back to sleep.

Richard stares up at the ceiling.

FADE TO BLACK

OLIVE (V.O.)

Dad...?

INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAWN

Richard opens his eyes. Olive is standing next to the bed.

The blue light of dawn is coming through the windows.

RICHARD
What is it, hon...?

OLIVE
Grandpa won't wake up.

Richard takes this in.

EXT. AMBULANCE ROOF - DAY

We are behind the lights of an ambulance as it speeds down a commercial strip. The LIGHTS FLASH and SIREN BLARES.

INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM - DAY

Everyone sits silently in a waiting room, waiting for news.

Olive, bored, goes through a rack of medical flyers. She takes one and approaches Dwayne.

OLIVE
You want to take an eye test?
(Dwayne shakes his

head)
Uncle Frank? You want to take an eye
test?

SHERYL

Olive, come here. Put that away.
We're gonna have a family meeting.
Dwayne? Family meeting.

RICHARD

What? Now?

SHERYL
Richard...! Let's just do it.

She takes a breath. She turns to the kids.

SHERYL
First of all, the doctors are doing
everything they can to help Grandpa

right now. He's had a long...
(searches for words)
 
...eventful life, and I know he loves
both of you very much. But if God

wants to take him, we have to be
ready to accept that, okay?
(they nod)
Now, I think you guys know we've
been having money problems lately,

with Richard's venture and
everything... Things haven't really
gone the way we hoped. So it looks
like when we get home we might have
to make some changes in the way we

live. We might have to move out of
our house. We might have to declare
bankruptcy. I don't know. I have to
talk to a lawyer about all that.

She looks at Richard, the kids. Her voice becomes shaky.

SHERYL
But whatever happens -- we're a
family. What's important is that we

love each other. I love you guys so,
so, so much...

She turns away, starts to cry. Frank puts his hand on her shoulder. Sheryl grasps it. Olive and Dwayne watch Sheryl.

Dwayne writes a note, shows it to Olive. It reads:

"Go hug Mom!"

Olive goes and hugs Sheryl. Sheryl, crying, picks up Olive and holds her in her lap, hugging her. Dwayne gets up, goes across the waiting room and stares out the window.

OUT THE WINDOW

A second floor view. It's a banal suburban landscape. Cars go busily back and forth on a distant road.

Dwayne just stares out the window with a blank face. Behind him, a DOCTOR enters the waiting area.

DOCTOR
Are you the family of Edwin Harvey?

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

Everyone is gathered in a smaller room. The Doctor closes the door behind him. He turns to face them.

DOCTOR
I'm sorry. We did everything we could.
He was... It was too much. He probably
fell asleep and never woke up. I'll
have someone come talk about handling

the remains.
 
RICHARD
Thank you. Appreciate it.

The Doctor opens the door and calls down the hall.

DOCTOR
Linda...!

He gestures, then departs. Silence.

OLIVE
Is Grandpa dead?

SHERYL

Yeah, honey. He's passed away.

Olive nods, says nothing.

A hospital administrator, LINDA, comes in with a sheaf of papers. She is overburdened and all business.

LINDA

I'm your bereavement liaison, Linda.
My consolations for your loss.

RICHARD
Thank you, Linda.

Linda hands Richard her sheaf of paperwork.

LINDA
(fast, indifferent)
Okay. These are the forms you need
to fill out -- death certificate,

report of death and the M.E. pink
slip. Try and be as detailed as
possible. This is a brochure for our

Grief Recovery Support Group that
meets Tuesdays. If you'd like, I can
refer you at this time to a funeral
home so you can begin making
arrangements.

Richard and Sheryl glance at each other.

RICHARD
Um, actually, pre-arrangements have
been made with a home in Maryland.

LINDA
In Maryland...?

RICHARD
Yeah, we're passing through. Y'see,
we're trying to get to Boca Raton...

LINDA

Okay -- if the body is crossing state
lines? You're gonna need a Burial
 
Transit Permit from the County
Registrar...

RICHARD

Okay, fine, but here's the thing --

we're trying to get to Boca Raton by
three o'clock this afternoon...

LINDA

Three o'clock? Today?
(checks her watch)
That ain't gonna happen.

RICHARD

It's for my daughter. This is really
important.

LINDA
It may be important, but you still

have to fill out this paperwork.

RICHARD

Okay, I know this is unusual... Is

there a way we can go and come back?

I mean, can we do paperwork later?

LINDA

You can't abandon the body...
 

RICHARD

I'm not gonna abandon the body. I just want to go and come back. We just need to get to Boca and then we'll back! We'll come back!
 


LINDA

...Otherwise the hospital becomes responsible... Sir, there's a way these things need to be done. Sir? come Sir...? Sir!!!

 

LINDA

Sir, this may surprise you, but you're
not the only one who's had someone
die here today, all right?! Now we
have a way of doing things around
here, and I'm gonna ask you to respect

our rules and procedures!

Silence. Richard stares at the floor, seething. A pause.
Richard speaks with great restraint.

RICHARD
Could you...? Is there a way we could

view the remains?

LINDA

(nods, also restrained)
I'll show you, yes. We haven't had a
chance to move him downstairs.

She leads them out.

INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY
 
Linda stops in front of an intensive care room.

LINDA

He's in here. Now someone may come
by in a few minutes to take him to
the basement, but just tell them who

you are. They'll wait.

RICHARD
Thank you.

LINDA
When you're done with the paperwork
I'll be in the nurse's station.

RICHARD

Okay. Great. Thank you, Linda.

She departs.

INT. INTENSIVE CARE ROOM - DAY

They enter. It's quiet. There's a body under a sheet.

Richard walks over and peers under it, then puts it down.

He turns away and faces the wall. He starts hyperventilating -- choking down the emotion. He doesn't want to lose control, and he's not comfortable showing his feelings.

RICHARD

(under his breath)
Goddamn it, Dad. Goddamn it,

(beat)
Stupid, stupid, stupid...!!!

He shakes his head and takes a few sharp breaths, getting himself under control -- still facing the wall.

Sheryl hugs Olive, stroking her hair. Olive is dry-eyed -- this is all new to her. Sheryl bends down and whispers:

SHERYL

We'll do Little Miss Sunshine next
year. Okay, honey? Next year.

Olive nods. No one says anything. Finally, Richard turns around. He is very determined.

RICHARD
No. We've come seven hundred miles.
I'll be damned if I'm not making
that contest.

SHERYL
Honey... We can't leave him!

RICHARD
 
We're not going to leave him.

Richard dumps the paperwork in a wastebasket. He opens the door, glances into the hallway. He closes the door.

RICHARD
Fuck...!

He looks desperately around the room. He sees the window.

He goes to the window, opens it up.

EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY

Richard peers out the window. He's at the back side of the building, seven or eight feet above a near-empty parking lot.

INT. INTENSIVE CARE ROOM - DAY

Richard ducks back in. He tosses his car keys to Dwayne.

RICHARD
Dwayne. Go around outside.

SHERYL
Richard... What are you thinking?

RICHARD

We'll take him with us.

SHERYL

No, Richard. No. That's not going to
happen.

RICHARD
He's better off with us than with
these people!
(to Dwayne)
Go under the window. Frank, you go
with him.

SHERYL
Dwayne, don't you dare!
(to Richard)
Look: you stay here. We'll take Olive.
Frank'll drive!

RICHARD

We'll be there in two hours! I'll
have a funeral home meet us as soon
as we arrive!

(never say die:)
Listen, everyone. If there's one
thing Grandpa would've wanted, it's
to have Olive perform at the Little
Miss Sunshine pageant. I believe

we'd be doing a grave disservice to
his memory if we gave up now. There's
 
two kinds of people in the world;
winners and losers. And what's the

difference? Winners don't give up.
So what are we here? Are we winners?
Or losers?

CUT TO:

EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY

Richard peeks out the window.

RICHARD
Okay, ready?

Frank, Dwayne, Sheryl and Olive stand under the window, trying to look inconspicuous. Frank gestures -- Wait.

Across the lot, two NURSES stroll toward the hospital.

FRANK
Not yet... Not yet...

The Nurses pass out of sight.

FRANK
Okay -- go, go, go!

Richard disappears for a second, then reappears with a big bundle wrapped in a sheet. He hoists it into the window.

RICHARD

Careful... Careful...

He edges the bundle off the window ledge. Frank and Dwayne gently lower the bundle to the ground. They glance around.

FRANK
Okay! Here we go! One, two...

Frank, Dwayne, Sheryl and Olive lift the bundle together and scuttle across the parking lot to the VW bus fifty feet away.

An ELDERLY COUPLE walking fifty yards away observes them.

FRANK
Be cool. Be cool. Almost there.

They arrive at the bus.

Dwayne whips open the VW's back door (a hatchback that hides your luggage) and they hoist the bundle in. Frank slams the door closed. Richard comes sprinting into the parking lot.

RICHARD
Okay, let's roll! You ready?

FRANK
Any time, Rich!
 
Richard starts up the bus, gets out and helps them push.

They get the bus rolling. The lot is at a slight incline, which helps. Finally, Richard jumps behind the wheel.

RICHARD

Okay, I'm putting it into gear...!

Sheryl and Olive jump in the side door.

Frank and Dwayne run behind the bus, pushing like crazy.

FRANK

Did I mention I'm the pre-eminent
Proust scholar in the US?

Richard REVS the engine and puts it in third. The bus begins picking up speed. Dwayne and Frank sprint along side.

This time, Dwayne is prepared to push Frank up along-side the bus. Frank lunges in. Dwayne jumps in after him.

INT. VW BUS - DAY

Dwayne slides the door shut. They're giddy and breathless from the escape. They quickly sober up.

RICHARD

Okay, what time is it?

SHERYL

(checks her watch)
It's 11:30. How much further...?

RICHARD
I dunno. Two hundred miles...?

FRANK

And when does registration end?

SHERYL

Three o'clock.

They do the math.

FRANK

It's gonna be close.

RICHARD
No, we'll make it. We just can't
stop. No one has to pee, right?

Olive is thinking.

OLIVE
Dad? What's gonna happen to Grandpa?

RICHARD
 
Honey, as soon as we get to Florida,
I'm gonna call a funeral home in

Maryland and they'll take care of
everything. Your Grandpa was smart
and planned ahead. Okay?

Olive nods.	That's not really what she was asking about.

Sheryl sees this.

SHERYL
Honey, Grandpa's soul is in Heaven
now. He's with God. Okay?

Olive nods. She turns and looks out the window.

OUT THE WINDOW

The passing landscape of the road leading back to the Interstate. It seems a long way from God.

CLOSE ON OLIVE

Thinking.

FADE TO BLACK

Begin MUSIC -- the same quiet tune that began the film.

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY - MONTAGE

The VW cruises past fields, billboards, farms, rest stops.

INT. VW BUS - ON THE ROAD - DAY - MONTAGE

The dialogue below plays over the following shots.

The family drives in silence, each looking out the window.

Richard drives -- stoic, determined.

Sheryl is pensive. She sneaks glances at Richard.

Frank, subdued, watches Sheryl. He rubs Olive on the head.

Olive, headphones around her neck, stares out the window.

Dwayne lies across the back seat, staring up.

DWAYNE'S POV — Passing power lines undulate against the sky.

From the back, we see the highway passing as each person is lost in a reverie.

Sheryl, in the front, looks at Richard, reaches over and rubs Richard's neck. Richard glances at her, keeps driving.

OLIVE (O.S.)

Uncle Frank? Does everyone get to go
to Heaven?
