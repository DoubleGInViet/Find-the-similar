FADE UP
CLOSE UP on the face of YURI ORLOV.
Late-thirties, maybe the wrong side of forty, cigarette dangling from his fingers, wearing a conservative suit and tie.
Black smoke wafts in front of his face. He speaks matter-of-factly,
directly into camera.
YURI
There are over 550 million firearms in worldwide circulation. That's one firearm for every twelve people on the planet. The only question is... 
(taking a draft and stubbing out
the cigarette)
... how do we arm the other eleven?
The camera zooms away from his face, revealing:
Yuri alone on a battlefield surrounded by the charred carcasses
of
armored military vehicles and other equipment, discarded weapons
and
ammunition, desert floor stained with what appears to be blood.
The faint sound of gunfire, some distance away, carries to us on
the
wind.
CUT TO:
A TITLE SEQUENCE FOLLOWS - A CONTINUOUS SHOT FROM A CAMERA MOUNTED ON THE BACK OF A BULLET CASING - ILLUSTRATING THE LIFESPAN OF THE BULLET.
- Gunpowder is poured into a metal casing, lead slug mounted on
top.
A BULLET is born.	A perfect 39mm.
-	The BULLET travels along a conveyor belt with thousands of identical siblings in a Ukrainian factory so grey it's
monochrome.
- The BULLET, picked up by a ham-fisted UKRAINIAN FACTORY WORKER,
is
tossed into a crate.
- The BULLET, lying in its open crate, rolls down a chute where
it's
inspected by a UKRAINIAN MILITARY OFFICER holding a manifest. He seems to stare directly at our BULLET.
UKRAINIAN OFFICER
(to his SUBORDINATE carrying a
manifest, in Ukrainian)
Call it "agricultural machinery".
-	The BULLET's crate rattles around in an open-bed truck along an industrial road, passes a decapitated statue of LENIN.
-	The crate containing our BULLET is placed on a ship in
the cold grey Odessa harbor.	A container door closes, plunging
the
bullet into darkness.
- The door re-opens.	The BULLET, still in its crate, now basks
in
bright, tropical sunshine, surrounded by an azure sea.
-	The crate is removed by a pair of slim, dark hands, revealing a glimpse of the bustling, weathered port of Abidjan in the Ivory Coast. The crate is one of dozens unloaded from the ship.
-	BULLET's POV from another open-air truck, now slogging through
a
mud-clogged road in lush rainforest.
- The BULLET is unloaded from the truck in Freetown, Sierra Leone
-
immediately grabbed by the young HAND of a RUF soldier.
-	The BULLET is loaded into a 30-round magazine which is inserted into an AK-47 machine gun.
-	The BULLET waits - in the gloomy chamber. Suddenly, from outside,
the sound of raised voices and gunfire.
-	The BULLET and its neighbors start to rise quickly up the magazine
towards the chamber as the Kalashnikov is fired.
-	Our hero BULLET is next.  Will it see action?
-	Smack. The gun's bolt strieks the explosive cap, gunpowder ignited, the BULLET driven out of the barrel.
-	Shed of its casing - now only a slug - the BULLET emerges into bright sunshine. It is flying down the main street in Freetown.
-	The BULLET gives us a perfect point-of-view of the bullet ahead
of
it. They are both flying towards their intended target - a wild-eyed CHILD SOLDIER, a boy no more than twelve, firing an AK-47 almost as tall as he is.
- The leading bullet narrowly misses, whistles past the boy's
ear,
striking the whitewashed wall behind - one more pock-mark in a building riddled with pock-marks.
- Our BULLET, following close behind, finds its mark, slamming
into
the boy's forehead just above his left eye - his expression, oddly
relieved.
-	The BULLET carves through the lobes of the boy's brain where it is enveloped in blood, finally plunged into darkness - the bullet's final resting place.
CUT TO BLACK
EXT.	ODESSA - MAIN STREET.	DAY.
"Towards A Brighter Socialist Future", reads a billboard in the
main
street.
Odessa,
U.S.S.R - 1980
Fifteen-year-old YURI walks into frame. He spies a long line snaking away from the door of a barren grocery store.
YURI (V.O.)
I was born Yuri Orlovitch in the city of Odessa in a country that no longer exists. You might have heard of it - a little place called the Soviet Union.
A YOUNG COMMUNIST sits in the shadow of a statue of Trotsky in
the
Soviet-style plaza, jacket and neckerchief removed in the summer heat,
poring over a Communist text. Yuri approaches, pretends to be interested in the statue, glances to the Young Communist's book.
YURI
(in subtitled Ukrainian, looking over the idealist's shoulder)
All property is theft.
The Young Communist nods at this kindred spirit. Yuri pats his comrade on the back, taking the opportunity to steal the boy's
red
neckerchief and Lenin pin.
INT.	GROCERY STORE.	DAY.
Now wearing the pin in his own jacket along with the neckerchief
and
a stern expression, YURI strides to the front of the line in the store.
YURI (V.O.)
Where I grew up, everyone was equal. Some were just more equal than others.
The female STORE CLERK is about to order Yuri to the back of the line when Yuri flashes the pin.
Intimidated, the Clerk smiles and pulls a special tray from under the counter. In contrast to the meager offerings on the shelves, the tray contains bags of sugar, coffee, bananas, even Pepsi.
INT.	APARTMENT - ODESSA.	DAY.
A Soviet-style apartment building. Front door opens - YURI enters,
shopping bag in hand.
His mother, IRINA, pokes her head out of the kitchen.	Yuri holds
up
a banana.
YURI
(in subtitled Ukrainian)
Shortages?	What shortages?
Irina shakes her head in amazement.
INT.	APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM.	DAY.
While a parade of weapons in Red Square plays silently on the state-
controlled TV, father ANATOLY and Military Cadet older brother VITALY, shoulder bandaged, sit at a tiny table, drinking cheap
vodka
and listening intently to an illegal shortwave radio - coat hanger
for antenna.
YURI (V.O.)
My father was a wounded hero of World War Two, my younger brother was wounded in Afghanistan - a war without heroes. I'd gotten out of military service due to a heart problem - it wasn't completely a lie.
YURI joins them, careful not to interrupt the broadcoast.
He goes to pour himself a glass of vodka.	Without looking away
from
the radio, his father's hand grasps Yuri's in a vice-like grip, preventing him from lifting the bottle.
RADIO ANNOUNCER
(impossibly upper-crust British
accent)
--Finally, in response to human rights protests and in an effort to encourage the United States to sell grain to the Soviet Union after two successive crop failures, it is reported that the politburo has consented to permit a limited number of Jews to emigrate from the Soviet Union to Israel.
(beat)
And that concludes this edition of news from the BBC World Service.
Anatoly, deep in thought, switches off the radio. IRINA enters, puts Yuri's "feast" on the table.
They speak Ukrainian, subtitled.
ANATOLY
(incredulous)
Trading Jews for grain.
VITALY
(reaching for a banana)
It's good P.R. - for the Moscow Olympics.
IRINA
(shrugs)
Good for the Jews.
YURI
And us.
All eyes to Yuri, family confused.
YURI (cont'd)
(matter-of-fact)
We're Jewish.
VITALY
(scoffing)
We're not Jewish.
YURI
(shrug)
We're Jewish if we say we're Jewish.
The stunned family stares at him - out of the mouths of babes. Anatoly
finally breaks the silence, pours Yuri a drink.
ANATOLY
Mazeltov.
Yuri and the family drink to their new identity.
EXT.	CEMETERY, ODESSA.	DAY.
A sea of Jewish gravestones.
YURI and ANATOLY bribe the cemetery CUSTODIAN.
YURI (V.O.)
There have been few occasions in the twentieth century when it's been an advantage to be a Jew.
Under his father's watchful gaze, Yuri takes a rubbing from one
of
the headstones - "ORLOV".
INT.	UKRAINIAN GOVERNMENT OFFICE.	DAY.
ANATOLY, with YURI at his side, presents the rubbing along with other crudely forged paperwork confirming their Jewish ancestry
to a
CLERK.	"ORLOVITCH" now "ORLOV".
YURI (V.O.)
The rubbing from the Jewish headstone was my first forged document. Little about my life has been kosher ever since.
The Clerk gives Anatoly and Yuri the once-over, then stamps an emigration visa.
INT.	APARTMENT, BEDROOM.	NIGHT.
Suitcase in hand, YURI surveys his bedroom for the last time.
A car horn. He glances through the window to the communist-style plaza below. ANATOLY beckons impatiently to Yuri. VITALY and
IRINA
load overstuffed suitcases into an old Russian sedan driven by an old Russian Military Officer, UNCLE DMITRI.
Yuri stares at himself in the mirror. He replaces his stolen Soviet
pin for a necklace - a Star of David.
INT.	BEN GURION AIRPORT - TEL AVIV.	DAY.
CLOSE UP on a heavily-retouched photograph of GOLDA MEIR. She's still not pretty.
YURI stares up at it.
YURI (V.O.)
We Russian Jews were supposed to be headed for Israel but I didn't see much of the country on that first trip.
We reveal he is standing in a jam-packed, standing-roam-only "TRANSIT" lounge.
YURI (V.O.)
Real Jews or fake Jews, eighty-five percent of us ended up in that other "promised land".
The Pan American destination board reads: "PA 447 to NEW YORK".
EXT.	BRIGHTON BEACH - "LITTLE ODESSA".	DUSK.
In the distance, a roller coaster in Coney Island, silhouetted against the afternoon sky.
"Little Odessa", New
York - 1984
The camera travels off the coaster to a restaurant, apartment above
it.
YURI (V.O.)
We congregated in New York's Brighton Beach because of its similarity to the Crimean Sea. I've always thought it's appropriate we moved next door to the circus.
INT.	"CRIMEAN RESTAURANT" - LITTLE ODESSA.	DAY.
A typical Jewish establishment with all its paraphernalia - menorah
on the mantle, etc. The family sits in a small dining room attached to the restaurant. ANATOLY reads the Torah as he waits for dinner with YURI and VITALY.
YURI (V.O.)
I had no idea my father would take his assumed identity so much to heart. I guess he just stayed in character.
YURI, older, as we now know him, studies school work. Long-haired
VITALY watches "Band Aid" on TV.
IRINA puts a plate of mussels in front of Anatoly.
ANATOLY
(glaring at the plate,
incredulous)
How many times--I can't eat shellfish. It's "treyf".
IRINA
You're not Jewish.
ANATOLY
I like it.
(picking up his felt fedora)
I like the hat - to remind us there's something above us. I like that.
Anatoly dons his hat.
ANATOLY (cont'd)
I'm going to temple.
IRINA
You're not going to temple. You go to temple more than the rabbi!
Vitaly begins eating his father's plate of mussels.	Yuri watches
his
father exit.
YURI (V.O.)
I was suffering an identity crisis of my own.
We focus on orientation booklets from a careers fair. Yuri shuffles
between the eagle of the CIA and the dove of the U.N.
YURI (V.O.)
My gift for languages made me highly sought after. The C.I.A. and U.N. were both heavily recruiting Russian immigrants.
Yuri settles on the dove.
EXT.	UNITED NATIONS.	DAY.
The idealistic YURI, ill-fitting suit, full of optimism, approaches
the United Nations Building.
YURI (V.O.)
Naturally, I went with the U.N. They were paying more.
He strides past Luxembourg's gift to the U.N. - a sculpture of a
gun
with its barrel tied in a knot.	Never gives it a look.
He is greeted at the entrance by an attractive female U.N. Official,
VIVIAN CARLISLE.	She likes what she sees.
INT.	ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIER.	DAY.
The blue helmeted YURI is seated in a white U.N. armored personnel
carrier, the background behind him morphs from
one Third World location to another: Third World desert to Third World rainforest to Third World slum.
YURI (V.O.)
The fastest way to find out you can't change the world is to actually go there.
EXT.	NRFL REBEL HEADQUARTERS - NORTHERN LIBERIA.	DAY.
Poolside at a recently-captured Southern-style colonial mansion,
a
long way from Georgia.
Gbamga, Liberia -
1985
YURI (V.O.)
West Africa's Liberia, or "land of the free", was originally established in the 1800's as a homeland for freed American negroes. It's been enslaved by one dictator or another ever since. They even copied their masters' Southern architecture.
A tatty pile of weapons - some from World War II - sits in front
of
a long negotiating table.
YURI, blue beret, observes the CHIEF U.N. ENVOY at the table opposite warlord ANDRE BAPTISTE, leader of the National Revolutionary Front of Liberia (NRFL).
Baptiste, 40's, is an imposing figure.	In full uniform despite
the
heat, he wears a jacket one size too small as if he cannot admit
his
extra few pounds. His THIRD WIFE stands next to him, wiping the sweat from his brow like an intermittent windscreen wiper.
YURI (V.O.)
It was my first meeting with the American-educated Andre Roosevelt Baptiste. While the warning signs were all there, no one had any idea what a monster he would eventually become. I certainly didn't think he would become my friend.
Baptiste has a U.N. document in front of him, awaiting his signature, clearly enjoying his moment in the sun.
U.N. ENVOY
(referring to the meager pile
of weapons)
--With all due respect, Mr. Baptiste, you don't seriously expect us to believe that this represents your entire arsenal.
Baptiste shrugs.
U.N. ENVOY (cont'd)
This is making a nonsense of the embargo ratified by all five permanent members of the Security Council. The escalation in the build up of arms jeopardizes not only order in the region but ultimately world order.
Baptiste smiles.
BAPTISTE
(playing to the gallery)
--World order? You say we jeopardize world order?
Baptiste's Third Wife wipes his brow.
BAPTISTE (cant'd)
Your idea of world order is when you're giving the orders to the world.
The Envoy has no response.
Baptiste rises from the table, leaving the unsigned document sitting
there.
BAPTISTE (cant'd)
Excuse me.
Baptiste is accompanied by two armed BODYGUARDS. Yuri's commanding
officer, CAPTAIN VIVIAN CARLISLE, motions for one of her detail
to
follow - Yuri.
BAPTISTE
(irritated by Yuri's presence)
I am only going to the restroom.
YURI
(shrug)
Orders.
They reach the door marked, "MEN".
BAPTISTE
(aside to his bodyguards as he enters)
This is what they mean by U.N. Observer?
Yuri winces at the remark.
INT.	PRESIDENTIAL MANSION RESTROOM.	DAY.
BAPTISTE pisses at a urinal. YURI and the BODYGUARDS hang back a respectful distance.
BAPTISTE
(taunting Yuri)
Aren't you going to help me hold my cock?
YURI
(glancing towards the urinal) Doesn't look like a job for two men.
The BODYGUARDS stiffen at the insult.	Baptiste stares Yuri down
for
a moment, then suddenly bursts into laughter. The TWO BODYGUARDS also start to laugh - cautiously.
Baptiste washes his hands, stares at Yuri in the mirror, smiles.
BAPTISTE
You know you are fighting a losing battle, my young friend. War is nature. If you take away the guns, we will kill each other with knives. Take away the knives, we will kill each other with sticks. Take away the sticks, we will kill each other with your peace treaties.
(turning to face Yuri)
You cannot stop this bath of blood.
YURI
It's not "bath of blood". It's, "blood bath".
BAPTISTE
Thank you.	But I like it my way.
Baptiste smiles and exits, leaving the words ringing in Yuri's head.
EXT.	U.N. COMPOUND - MONROVIA.	DAY.
A pep rally for the mostly male U.N. PEACEKEEPERS.	A stage has
been
erected in the rundown Embassy grounds. They chant and stamp their feet
impatiently.
A U.N. OFFICER, acting as M.C., approaches the microphone.
M.C.
(battling the microphone's
feedback)
And now, we have a surprise for you. The 83rd West African Peacekeeping Corp is proud to present, all the way from El Salvador, the newly crowned Miss World, Ava Cordova.
From behind a jerry-rigged curtain appears the vision that is AVA CORDOVA. She wears a dress that appears to have been sewn onto
her.
She is obscenely beautiful in the squalid setting.
The peacekeepers roar and whistle their approval. YURI, near the front
of the stage, is hypnotized.
Standing closer to Yuri than necessary, despite the crush, is CAPTAIN
VIVIAN CARLISLE (attractive in her own right but pales in comparison
with the Goddess on stage).	She catches Yuri's reaction.
U.N. PEACEKEEPERS
(chanting to Ava)
Take it off, baby!	Take it off!
Ava steps up to the microphone.
AVA
(referring to the sea of U.N.
berets)
Baby blue.	My favorite color!
A roar of approval from the men.
AVA (cant'd)
I suppose I could give you the speech about "my hope for world peace" but I have a feeling you don't want to hear that today.
U.N. PEACEKEEPER
(calling out)
My hope is for a piece of your ass!
They roar again.
AVA
(laughing it off)
I don't know if you'll be taking me to bed tonight, darling, but you can take her.
Ava unfurls a life-size poster of herself in a swimsuit, flirtatiously holding it up against her body. She tosses other posters to eager hands.
AVA (cant'd)
You're all doing a great job - keep it up. Enjoy the show!
On stage, a generic-looking ROCK GROUP starts to play a cover
from
the 80's - Tears For Fears' "Shout". Ava dances enthusiastically,
provocatively.
Ava appears to make eye-contact with Yuri - blowing a kiss in his direction. He is paralyzed.
LATER
BACKSTAGE, YURI and other Peacekeepers observe AVA escorted towards
a huge, American car.	An inebriated U.N. PEACEKEEPER tries to
get
her attention.
U.N. PEACEKEEPER
Ava!	Ava!
As the young man reaches out to her, a slick, handsome BUSINESS MANAGER shoves him aside.
MANAGER
Don't touch what you can't afford.
The Manager slips into the car beside Ava.	The U.N. Peacekeeper
and
Yuri watch the car roar away.
U.N. PEACEKEEPER
(regretting indulging the fantasy)
Let's get drunk.
EXT.	DOWNTOWN MONROVIA - BAR.	NIGHT.
YURI and two other U.N. PEACEKEEPERS get loaded on local beer
with
local PROSTITUTES - one of the peacekeepers pouring beer down a prostitute's throat.
From the shadows across the street, a LIBERIAN MAN observes the group.
Yuri's colleagues toss some Liberian dollars at a waiter and stagger
drunkenly away from the bar, leaning for support on the PROSTITUTES.
YURI remains at the verandah, exchanges a smile with a YOUNG PROSTITUTE, at least two years from legal.
He's tempted.	He knocks back his drink.	He approaches the girl
-
presses a few bills into her hand.	She picks up her purse, makes
to
leave with him but he motions her to stay.
MONROVIAN GIRL
(referring to the money)
What's this?
YURI
(explaining the tip)
For the smile.
Yuri exits alone.	The Liberian Man, across the street, follows.
EXT.	DOWNTOWN MONROVIA - STREET.	NIGHT.
YURI walks down a poorly-lit sidestreet.	He feels something in
his
back - stops abruptly.	His hand reflexively goes to his holster.
Empty.
He turns. The young LIBERIAN MAN is holding him up with his own gun.
YURI
(mixing English and French)
Fuck, no, no, no, no--fuck, no. Money? You want money?
(going through his pockets,
he starts pulling out loose bills) Fuck, no. Don't shoot. Don't shoot me. Fuck. U.S. dollars.
(referring to the face on a five
dollar bill)
President Lincoln.
The Liberian puts his finger to his lips to hush Yuri.
The Liberian appears more interested in the gun than the hold-up.
LIBERIAN MAN
(in flawless English)
Glock .45.
The Liberian produces a crisp U.S. twenty dollar bill of his own, offers it to Yuri.
LIBERIAN MAN (cont'd)
(referring to the face on a twenty
dollar bill)
Jackson.
YURI
What?
Yuri stares at the money, bewildered.
LIBERIAN MAN
President Jackson.
He shakes his head.
YURI
No.
LIBERIAN MAN
(misinterpreting him)
You are driving a hard bargain.
He hands Yuri a second twenty.
YURI
(flabbergasted)
No, keep it.	Keep the money.	Keep the gun.
LIBERIAN MAN
(offended)
What do you take me for - a thief?
The Liberian stuffs the money in the pocket of the bewildered Yuri.
LIBERIAN MAN
Demand and supply.
(referring to the gun)
There is more I am thinking where this comes from.
YURI
(incredulous)
You want more Glocks?
LIBERIAN MAN
And the Heckler & Koch G-3 assault rifle.
YURI
What makes you think I'll do that?
LIBERIAN MAN
(quizzical)
I will come back and shoot you with the Glock.
(checking the magazine, referring
to the bullets)
By the way, do you have the hollow point cartridges?
Yuri stares at the man.
YURI
(facetious, nodding to the gun) You got any color preference for that?
LIBERIAN MAN
(missing the sarcasm, regarding the gun)
Kelly green.
(meeting Yuri's eye)
I will find you.
The Liberian walks away, still admiring his new weapon. Yuri stares
after him.
YURI (V.O.)
He'd come to the right place - peacekeepers are armed to the teeth. And nothing but premium product. The U.N. mostly buys from Switzerland - where else?
INT.	CAPTAIN CARLISLE'S PRIVATE QUARTERS.	NIGHT.
CLOSE ON two blue helmets lying beside each other.
YURI and CAPTAIN VIVIAN CARLISLE are under the mosquito netting
of a
bed in her private quarters - trying to get each other out of their
respective clothes as fast as possible - mouths and hands everywhere.
Even in the heat of the moment, VIVIAN is unable to completely
let
go of her work.
VIVIAN
(between heavy breaths)
What are we doing here, Yuri?
YURI
(kissing her nipple)
Whatever you want.
VIVIAN
You know what I mean. Here, in this country. Are we doing any good?
YURI
(finally telling her what she
wants to hear)
Would nothing be better?
Satisfied with the answer, she completely gives in to the throes
of
passion - pulls him to her.
LATER
VIVIAN, satiated, dozes amongst the rumpled sheets, backside exposed.
YURI uses the opportunity to take an impression of the key attached
to her belt.
EXT.	EMBASSY COMPOUND.	NIGHT.
A white armored personnel carrier sits unattended.
The LIBERIAN MAN and two COLLEAGUES approach the carrier's door.
It
opens with their newly-made key.
The men start to unload the weapons inside the carrier, spilling
a
box of ammunition in their haste.
The camera drifts off the carrier to reveal YURI, behind the barracks, counting a thick wad of U.S. dollars.
Spying a lone BULLET on the ground, Yuri picks it up. We sense he has
made a decision from which there is no return.
EXT.	INT.	"THE CRIMEAN" RESTAURANT - BRIGHTON BEACH.	DAY.
The BULLET has been turned into a pendant, replacing Yuri's Star
of
David.
YURI, wearing a sharp, new suit, enters the family restaurant.
One
table of CUSTOMERS - not exactly a thriving concern.
YURI (V.O.)
The starting salary for a U.N. interpreter back then was $32,000. I made fifty K on "misplaced" weapons on that one trip alone. I doubt the Secretary General noticed. The U.N. spends more on lunch.
Yuri kisses father and Maitre d', ANATOLY, who is adding more Jewish
decoration to the window. He bear hugs mother, IRINA, nearly causing her to drop the plates she is carrying.
YURI (V.O.)
My tour as a peacekeeper was the perfect preparation for war.
Irina notices the change in her son's appearance.
IRINA
(calling after him)
Who are you? You're not my son. My son doesn't own such a suit.
Yuri flashes his killer smile in response.
Out of their sight, he slips a hundred dollar bill into the cash register and breezes into the kitchen.
INT.	"THE CRIMEAN" RESTAURANT - KITCHEN.	DAY.
VITALY, now chef in the family business, prepares a Russian borscht
in a kitchen unlikely to pass a health inspection.
YURI tastes the food, pretends to gag, spits it out in the sink. Vitaly affectionately cuffs his older brother - the joke obviously a familiar ritual.
Yuri takes his brother to the kitchen's rear door.
EXT.	"THE CRIMEAN" RESTAURANT.	DAY.
At the back of the restaurant, YURI and VITALY sit on the steps amongst the garbage cans.
YURI
You know who's going to inherit the earth?
Vitaly looks at him blankly.
YURI (cont'd)
Arms dealers - because everybody else is too busy killing each other.
YURI plonks a glossy arms brochure in front of Vitaly.	He takes
in
the contents.
VITALY
(regarding his brother)
It's a hell of a fucking career move.
YURI
That's the point. I've seen how the world's coming apart.
VITALY
And you want to help with that?
YURI
You can't stop it.
(warming to his theme)
It's a basic human need - we eat, sleep, sleep with each other and what else? Fight. The oldest human skeletons have spearheads in their rib cages.
Vitaly is still skeptical.
VITALY
What do you know about guns?
YURI
(joking darkly)
I know which end I'd rather be on.
(adopting a serious tone)
Every day there are people shooting at each other. I think to myself, what guns are they using? Why not mine?
VITALY
(hesitant)
I don't know.
YURI
(pressing his argument)
Vitaly, I've tasted your borscht, you're no fucking chef. I can eat here for free and I still don't eat here. You're doing nothing with your life.
VITALY
Maybe doing nothing's better than doing this.
(referring to an image
of a gun)
Yuri, I've actually fired one of these things.
Yuri puts his arm around his brother's shoulder.
YURI
That's why I need you.
(coaxing)
Brothers in arms.
Vitaly smiles, looks sold.
EXT.	ISRAEL CENTRAL TEMPLE - BRIGHTON BEACH.	DAY.
ANATOLY makes his way to the synagogue.	YURI, hastily adjusting
his
yarmulke, falls into step.
ANATOLY
(pleasantly surprised)
Finally getting in touch with what's important, my Son?
YURI
(simply)
Yes.
However, instead of the synagogue, he is fixed on another distinguished Jewish man, ELI KURTZMAN, on a street corner also
on
his way to temple.
YURI (V.O.)
It wasn't God I was trying to get close to.
Anatoly introduces Yuri to Eli, who regards Yuri warily.
YURI (V.O.)
Dad's contacts at synagogue landed me my first Israeli-made Uzis and an introduction to the biggest of the big guns.
CLOSE ON THE UNDERCARRIAGE OF A TWA 747, TAKING OFF FROM JFK.
INT.	CONVENTION CENTER - PARIS.	DAY.
A platoon of attractive YOUNG WOMEN in camouflage mini-dresses show off
the latest sniper rifles and grenade launchers.
An ASIAN BUSINESSMAN pitches hardware to YURI. VITALY is more interested in the girls.
ASIAN BUSINESSMAN
(brochure in hand)
--I can get you the shoulder-fired SA-7 surface-to-air missiles. The older Chinese model. Not so effective against modern military aircraft but deadly if used against a commercial airliner. I'm giving them away at eight-fifty.
Yuri notices that his vendor's attention has wandered to a suave older gentleman, SIMEON ZAHAROFF, surrounded by eager VENDORS of
all
nationalities.	The Asian man joins the enthusiastic throng.
YURI (V.O.)
It was the eighties and the Cold War was far from thawed. Most of the deals were government-to-government. There were some go-betweens - freelancers - but it was a mostly private club with a lifetime club president.
Yuri drags Vitaly away from the sales girls.
YURI
That's him.	The guy Eli told me about.	Simeon
Zaharoff.	Brokered deals in the Iran/Iraq war
-	both sides, sold missiles to Argentina in the Falklands. Hets a fucking legend. I've got to talk to him.
Yuri pushes past Zaharoff's entourage.
YURI
Simeon!	Simeon!
A BODYGUARD tries to step between Yuri and Zaharoff.
VITALY
(stepping between the bodyguard
and Yuri)
They're talking.
Zaharoff, irritated, nonetheless humors Yuri.
SIMEON
May I help you?
YURI
A mutual friend, Eli Kurtzman from Brighton Beach Import-Export said to contact you. I have a business proposal. Perhaps we can discuss it - over a drink.
Simeon looks him up and down.
SIMEON
You're in the wrong place my young friend.
This is no place for amateurs.
Simeon walks away without another word. Vitaly shrugs. Yuri fumes.
YURI
(under his breath in Ukrainian)
Yob tvayu mat.	(Subtitled - Motherfucker.)
Yuri watches Simeon go, surrounded by flunkies.
YURI (V.O.)
Curious how you always revert to your native
tongue in moments of extreme anger... 
INT.	HOTEL ROOM - PARIS.	NIGHT
Camouflage minidress and beret are now discarded on the floor - a contrast to the blue helmet seen earlier.
YURI (V.O.)
... and ecstacy.
YURI and VITALY are getting it on with two SALES GIRLS.
We pan from one couple in the living room, Vitaly, to the one in the bedroom, Yuri.
We focus on Yuri, in the midst of the act - hears his brother's moans in Ukrainian.
VITALY (O.C.)
Boh... Boh.	Oh, Boh! (Subtitle:	God... God.
Oh, God!)
Yuri smiles at Vitaly's cries.	Something catches Yuri's eye on
TV.
CLOSE UP OF A TV SCREEN
showing images of the aftermath of the suicide bombing at the
U.S.
barracks in Lebanon.
YURI (V.O.)
Vitaly and I found our niche in under-the-counter gunrunning - regimes suffering under sanctions.
EXT.	STREET - BEIRUT, LEBANON.	DAY.
A street lined with shelled buildings.
Beirut,
Lebanon - 1986
Through one of the shell holes, we glimpse YURI and VITALY with a LEBANESE CUSTOMER.
YURI (V.O.)
The job wasn't so different trom the U.N. I was just as neutral working for the ununited nations. An equal opportunity "merchant of death", I supplied every army but the Salvation Army.
We track with them, only getting occasional glimpses through the holes as they make their way through the war-torn streets of Lebanon.
YURI (V.O.)
We got our start in Lebanon after the suicide bombing.
They enter a building carrying a crude rendering of a Coke sign - "Taste Life." The model drinking the Coke is Ava Cordova.
INT.	BEIRUT WAREHOUSE.	DAY.
Inside the warehouse is a ten foot high, unruly pile of junked weapons.
YURI (V.O.)
When the United States leaves a war zone, they generally don't take their munitions. It costs more to bring it back than buy new stock.
YURI and VITALY usher the CUSTOMER over to an industrial scale loaded with assorted weapons.
YURI
I sell by the kilo.
The CUSTOMER checks the combined weight of the weapons.
YURI (cont'd)
(shrug)
They're second-hand weapons but they're still okay.
Both men pullout calculators and start haggling over the price.
YURI (V.O.)
For all my language skills, I soon discovered that what talks best is money. As long as you can speak dollars, dinars, drachmas, rubles, rupees, pesos, escudos, lira, krones, kwanzas, trancs, guilders, deutshmarks, yen and pounds-fucking-sterling, you can communicate anywhere in the world.
Money is finally exchanged.	Yuri and Vitaly leave the Customer
with
his munitions pot-pourri.
EXT.	BEIRUT WAREHOUSE.	DAY.
CLOSE ON a row of military decorations on an army jacket.
U.S. Army Officer, COLONEL OLIVER SOUTHERN, in dress uniform, adjusts the ribbons on his chest in the side mirror of a U.S. armored personnel carrier.
YURI approaches. In full view, he hands the Colonel a cut of the money.
The Colonel places the money in the same pocket decorated with ribbons.
EXT.	STREET - BEIRUT, LEBANON.	DAY.
YURI and VITALY walk back along the shelled street, Yuri recounting
what's left of the money.
YURI
(irritated by the meager amount)
This is bullshit money, Vit - small fucking potatoes.
VITALY
What do we do, go more legitimate?
YURI
No.	More illegal.
Vitaly nods thoughtfully.
VITALY
What I'd give right now for a plate of red cabbage and potatoes.
The wall explodes with gunfire.
Yuri and Vitaly drop to the ground, money flying.
The machine gun fire subsides, a shower of dust, fragments of brick
and hundred dollar bills still floating to the ground.
Vitaly, first to recover, draws his own handgun, sneaks a look through a shell hole.
On the other side of the wall, a firing squad of MILITIAMEN has executed one group of MEN, lying contorted, slumped against the wall. Their bound hands and feet give the bodies a macabre awkwardness.
Yuri is scrabbling in the dust for the cash.
The Militiamen prepare to execute another six men. Men? We focus
on one HANDSOME YOUNG LEBANESE BOY, barely in his teens.
Vitaly, gun poised, goes to intervene. A HAND, stuffed with cash,
stops him.	Yuri.
The brothers' eyes meet.
YURI
(whisper, motioning for them
to leave)
It's not our fight.
Vitaly's eyes well with tears.
After one look back to the teenage boy, Vitaly reluctantly complies
-	running with Yuri, heads down, away from the scene. As they run, the wall explodes again with gunfire.
CLOSE ON RONALD REAGAN
- a cardboard cut-out planted in a sand dune.
YURI and VITALY carry a crate from a taxi onto the desert floor
in
Somalia. A group of MUSLIM FREEDOM FIGHTERS eagerly surround the crate -
Yuri hands the Leader an Uzi machine gun.
YURI (V.O.)
I sold Israeli-made Uzis to Muslims.
The Muslim Leader tests it - shooting up the cardboard REAGAN.
His fighters applaud, Yuri and Vitaly slightly embarrassed.
EXT.	HIMALAYAS.	DAY.
A helicopter strains in the thin air to land on the Siachen Glacier
in the Himalayas.
YURI and VITALY, in thick parkas, emerge from the helicopter into near-blizzard conditions.
YURI (V.O.)
I sold to both Pakistan and India in their fight tor the most inhospitable land on earth.
INDIAN TROOPS, unseen at first due to their white camouflage uniforms, descend on the chopper - eager to unload the new guns
and
ammunition.
Yuri gasps for breath in the thin air.	An INDIAN SOLDIER gives
Yuri
a hit of oxygen as Vitaly supervises the unloading.
YURI
How's it going?
INDIAN COMMANDER
(admiring a new gun)
We're making terrific progress - most casualties from avalanches and frostbite.
YURI
(uncertain smile)
Make sure you thaw out the guns before you fight.
Yuri nods, takes another hit of oxygen.
EXT.	BORDER TOWN - CONGO.	DAY.
The town is deserted. YURI and VITALY are confused as they prepare
to unload an arms consignment from a truck.
YURI (V.O.)
We had our set-backs. It's not called gunrunning for nothing.
Up the street, a celebration is taking place - a band, balloons, confetti, dancing.
Finally, a Congolese man, JOHN "CANNIBAL" NGAWE, appears at the warehouse.
The conversation is in French.
YURI
(from the boat)
Cannibal, what's going on?
CANNIBAL
Cease fire, man.	Cease fire.	It's over.
YURI
What?!	What do you mean it's over?
CANNIBAL
Truce.	We're friends, man.
YURI
(looking to his unopened crates,
more and more agitated)
Friends?! You can't be fucking friends. Last week I spoke to you on the phone. You said you would not rest until every last rebel was dead. You called them vermin. You said would piss in their mouths, you said you would exterminate them like cockroaches. Just last week, you said this!
CANNIBAL
(shrug)
That was last week, man.
Cannibal starts to walk away.
YURI
Cannibal, don't you fucking walk away from me!
Cannibal flashes Yuri a peace sign.
CANNIBAL
Peace, man!
YURI
Fuck you, Cannibal!!
Yuri looks to Vitaly.
VITALY
(referring to the truck)
Maybe we can offload it - the Balkans.
YURI
(nodding in agreement)
At least when they say they're going to have a war, they keep their word.
EXT.	NORTHERN AFGHANISTAN.	DAY.
YURI and VITALY stand at a checkpoint in the rugged mountains. Guns and
ammunition are strapped to donkeys tended by MUJAHIDEEN FIGHTERS.
An
AFGHANI OFFICIAL inspects the cargo.
YURI (V.O.)
I even shipped cargo to Afghanistan when they were still fighting fellow Russians. But I never sold to Osama bin Laden. Not for any moral grounds. Back then he was always bouncing checks.
AFGHANI OFFICIAL
I hope you're not thinking of selling these,
Mr. Orlov.
YURI
(shakes his head)
Personal use.
AFGHANI OFFICIAL
There's a hundred thousand bullets here.
YURI
I'm kind of trigger happy.
Vitaly hands the Official his documentation - clipped to it, a thick
wad of bills.
The Afghani Official smiles. He returns to his mud-brick border station beside the confiscated merchandise.
Yuri focuses on a swimsuit calendar hanging on the mud wall -
Miss
May is AVA CORDOVA.
YURI (V.O.)
And everywhere I went, Ava Cordova kept following me around. We were as international as each other.
EXT.	FREIGHTER SHIP.	DAY.
We tilt up from the water to find YURI on the deck of a freighter,
ploughing the ballpoint blue seas off the coast of Colombia.
North of Barranquilla,
Colombia - 1989
