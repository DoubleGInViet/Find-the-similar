YURI (V.O.)
Operations like mine provided the only way for certain regimes to conduct a respectable war.
VITALY holds onto a railing trying to stave off seasickness, not helped by standing downwind from Yuri's cigarette smoke.
YURI (V.O.)
The freighter I was standing on carried 113 tons of weapons and ammunition for delivery to one of the poorest nations in Latin America in direct contravention of half a dozen international arms embargoes.
Yuri makes a call on his cell phone.
YURI (V.O.)
To keep authorities in the dark, I often spoke in code. Rocket launchers were "mothers", the rockets "children". Assault rifles were "apples". The AK-47 was "the Angel King".
YURI
(into phone)
The Angel King will arrive
tomorrow... Hallelujah to you too.
Yuri hangs up.	His phone rings with an incoming call.
YURI (cont'd)
(into phone)
Yes?... Slow the fuck down--what do you mean, tipped off? They know where we are?! Where are they?!
Yuri grabs a pair of binoculars. On the horizon, a fast-approaching
speed boat - INTERPOL AGENTS visible on the racer's deck.
YURI (cont'd)
(hanging up)
Forget it.
VITALY and the CAPTAIN, also spying the Customs Boat, join Yuri
at
the railing.
CAPTAIN
Do we run?
VITALY
We have to get out of here.
YURI
No, no-one's going anywhere.
(to the Captain)
Slow--dead slow.	Buy me time.
Yuri swings into action, frantically dials another number on his satellite cell phone.
YURI (cont'd)
(barking an order to a CREWMAN, referring to the Panamanian flag)
Get that fucking rag down!
The CREWMAN hastily complies.	Yuri's call is answered.
YURI (cont'd)
(trying not to sound too
desperate)
It's Yuri. I need another handle for this tub... something in our weight class.
(to an elderly Latin PAINTER,
pointing to the stern)
You, over the side!
(the painter hesitates)
Now!
The terrified PAINTER makes for the stern where he's hurriedly
winched over.
Yuri returns to the phone call.
YURI (cont'd)
Yes, it's got to check out... you got a shorter name!... what?--Kono? How do you spell that?... K-O-N-O. That's good!
He hangs up.
YURI (cont'd)
(to the PAINTER, already blacking
out the name, KRISTOL)
Kono!	K-O-N-O.
The PAINTER, nods nervously from his precarious perch, starts to paint.
Yuri sneaks another look through his binoculars.	The Customs
Boat
is closing fast.
YURI (cont'd)
(back into phone)
What are we flying?... Dutch?	Later.
(hanging up, to Vitaly)
Vit, get me a Dutch flag!
Yuri checks the Customs Boat again.
YURI (cont'd)
Damn, they're hauling!
He checks the Painter's progress.
YURI (cont'd)
(agitated, grasping the line of
the scaffold)
Faster! Or I send you in! (checking the binoculars again)
Faster... and better!
The Painter's hand is shaking.
VITALY (O.C.)
(panicked)
Yuri!
Vitaly is frantically rummaging through a trunk containing dozens
of
national flags.
VITALY (cant' d)
I don't have Dutch.
YURI
What?!
VITALY
I've got Belgium.
YURI
What the fuck use is that?!
(panicked, gesturing to the stern) He's painting a name registered in the fucking Netherlands!
Vitaly winces.
YURI (cont'd)
(mind racing)
You got France?!
VITALY
(confused, finding the tricolor)
Yes, why?
YURI
Turn it on its side.
Vitaly turns the flag sideways - now a makeshift Dutch flag. Vitaly
nods, impressed.
Yuri looks forward.	The Customs Boat has almost reached the bow
of
the freighter.
The flag is hoisted.	The Painter, barely completing the last "O"
of
"KONO", is hauled back on deck.
YURI (cont'd)
That's it!	Everybody look innocent--now!
The CREW resume their normal duties as the Customs Boat slows to
a
crawl itself, at close quarters with the freighter.
The heavily-armed INTERPOL AGENTS eyeball the rusted vessel.
YURI focuses on the senior agent - JACK VALENTINE. While the other
agents wear sunglasses, long hair, tattoo or personalized uniform,
Valentine is completely by the book. His Interpol windbreaker clean
and zipped to the neck.
YURI (V.O.)
They say every man has his price - but not every man gets it. Interpol Agent, Jack Valentine, couldn't be bought, at least not with money. For Jack, glory was the prize.
The Customs Boat ominously circles the freighter like a hungry shark.
EXT.	INTERPOL BOAT.	DAY.
VALENTINE never averts his eyes from the ship.
VALENTINE
Not exactly "The Love Boat".
Another AGENT hands him a phone.
VALENTINE (cont'd)
(into phone)
It's clean?... It doesn't look clean. I'm boarding.
EXT.	FREIGHTER / INTERPOL BOAT.	DAY.
From the railing, YURI watches the Interpol boat draw alongside
the
freighter.	He surreptitiously makes another phone call.
YURI
(anxious whisper into phone) It's Yuri. Phone in a sighting of the Kristol south of Aruba.
The boat is secured to the ladder that runs down the side of the freighter.
VALENTINE checks his sidearm, climbs the ladder.
EXT.	DECK - FREIGHTER.	DAY.
Yuri spies a life ring emblazoned with the word "KRISTOL". He flips
it around as Valentine and the other agents board.
Valentine strides past Yuri to a container, nods to an agent to
open
it.	The large metal door opens to reveal a large container full
of
grain - grain spilling onto the deck.
Valentine is about to plunge his hand into the grain when a mobile
phone rings.
A CREWMAN calls to Valentine from the bridge of the Interpol boat.
AGENT
(referring to the phone)
Sir, sighting of the Kristol due north.
Valentine hesitates, returns to the ladder.
As the agents go, they fail to see the pile of grain shift in the container exposing a crate of assault rifles hidden there.
EXT.	RAILING - FREIGHTER.	DAY.
Yuri and Vitaly watch the Interpol boat leap away.
On the FREIGHTER, we focus on the terrified PAINTER standing beside Yuri -
a pool of urine appears from the trouser leg.
Yuri pretends not to notice, slaps the Painter on the back.
YURI
Nice job.
CLOSE ON the word, "KONO".	From the "O", a paint drop runs down
the
stern.
EXT.	BARRANQUILLA HARBOR, COLOMBIA.	DAY.
YURI and VITALY supervise the unloading of the freighter from the dockside.
They are alerted by the sound of a battle raging somewhere on the outskirts of the docks.
A	Jeep, full to overflowing with heavily-armed NARCO-GUERRILLAS suddenly appears at the far end of the dock and speeds towards
them.
A military vehicle full of COLOMBIAN SOLDIERS chases the Guerrillas
several hundred yards behind.
The Jeep full of Guerrillas screeches to a stop by the freighter.
The NARC LEADER grabs a box of unloaded ammunition.
YURI
(in Spanish)
Hey, pay before you play.
NARC LEADER
(in Spanish)
You're late.
The Leader smashes the box on the concrete - bullets spilling everywhere.
VITALY
Hey, fuck you!
NARC LEADER
(jamming his handgun in Vitaly's
eye socket)
Fuck you!
Yuri tries to play peacemaker.
YURI
(reasoning with the Narc Leader)
No, you don't fuck him--
The Narc Leader turns and shoots Yuri in the side.
Yuri shudders with the impact. The enraged Vitaly lunges towards the Leader but Yuri, despite his wound, holds him back.
YURI (cont'd)
No, Vit.	No.
(to the Leader, referring to the
bullets)
Help yourselves.	Free sample.
Vitaly nurses Yuri to the ground.
The GUERRILLAS ignore them, frantically re-load just in time, immediately start shooting at the approaching government vehicle.
The government vehicle throws a vicious 180, almost toppling over.
The Guerillas, now back in business, take off after the government
troops.
Yuri lies on the dock, genuinely surprised by the sight of his
own
blood.
YURI (V.O.)
The first and most important rule of gunrunning is never get shot with your own merchandise.
INT.	WAREHOUSE - BARRANQUILLA, COLOMBIA.	DAY.
YURI, now heavily bandaged around the waist, and VITALY keep a watchful eye as the NARC LEADER inspects crates of machine guns
and
other ammunition.
YURI (V.O.)
The second rule is always ensure you have a foolproof way to get paid. Credit card, check, cash. Preferably in advance, ideally to an off-shore account. It's why I choose my customers so carefully. Say what you like about warlords and dictators, they tend to have a highly developed sense of order. They always pay their bills on time.
The Narc Leader nods his approval.
NARC LEADER
(referring to Yuri's wound)
I apologize for earlier.
YURI
(slight wince)
I understand.
WORKERS start loading the crates into a truck. The Narc Leader hands Yuri the suitcase.
NARC LEADER
It's all there.
Yuri snaps open the suitcase - inside six kilos of cocaine.
YURI
What is this?
NARC LEADER
Six keys of pure.
YURI
(incredulous)
I can't hand this to my fucking bank teller at Chase Manhattan.
NARC LEADER
(hair-trigger temper flaring
again)
You should be thanking me.
(waving his cell phone)
Have you checked the street price today? With the seizures at the border last week, it's jumped thirty percent.
YURI
I sell guns.	I don't sell drugs.
NARC LEADER
(shrug)
Diversify.
The Narc Leader walks away.
YURI
(calling after him)
I've got standards.
The Narc Leader ignores him, climbs in his Jeep and drives off.
The
truck, loaded with munitions, also exits.
Yuri and Vitaly are left alone in their warehouse.
VITALY
(staring at their "remuneration")
Now what?
Yuri shrugs, slices open one of the packs of cocaine. He takes a bill from his pocket, rolls it into a tube.
He goes to hand Vitaly the tube but his brother has already rolled
his own.
Vitaly dips his tube into the coke - snorts, keeps snorting - a longer inhale than should be possible for a human being.
INT.	HOTEL ROOM - BARRANQUILLA, COLOMBIA.	NIGHT.
Six kilo-sized coffee cans.	YURI, still bandaged, is pouring the
coffee down the toilet and replacing it with the bags of cocaine, mumbling Ukrainian profanities as he works.
The last bag is missing.
YURI
(sighs, exasperated)
Vit.
INT.	HOTEL HALLWAY.	NIGHT.
In the hotel corridor, YURI discovers the door to the adjacent room wide
open.
Inside, the room is vacant.
INT.	BOLIVIAN BUS.	DAY.
YURI, clearly fuming, is standing in a standing-roam-only Bolivian
public bus along with an assortment of PEASANTS, MIGRANTS and FARMYARD ANIMALS.
On the wall of the bus Yuri notices a cellphone ad featuring AVA CORDOVA.
YURI (V.O.)
I found Vitaly twelve days, two thousand miles and 150 grams later in a Bolivian boarding house.
INT.	VITALY'S ROOM - BOARDING HOUSE.	LA PAZ, BOLIVIA.	DAY.
The outline of Ukraine drawn with cocaine.
VITALY, out of his mind, pupils the size of nickels, humming a Ukrainian folk tune, is putting the finishing touches to the map from his badly depleted bag of cocaine.
with him, two BOLIVIAN PROSTITUTES, who appear to have passed out
or
worse.
A pounding on the door.
YURI (O.C.)
Vitaly!	Open this fucking door!
Vitaly, absorbed with the task at hand, appears not to notice.
Yuri
breaks in the door.
VITALY
(happy - way too happy)
Yuri!
(to the comatose prostitutes)
It's my brother, Yuri.	He's my big brother.
Yuri stares at the cocaine map.
YURI
What the fuck is that?
VITALY
Ukraine.
(indicating the direction he is
going to snort)
I start in Odessa, work my way to the Crimea--
YURI
(staring at the map, appalled)
--You'll be fucking dead before you reach
Kiev.
Yuri opens a window, the cocaine blows off the table.
VITALY
You fuck!
Vitaly freaks out, slams the window so hard it shatters. (The Hookers still don't rouse.)
VITALY (cant'd)
You fucking fuck!
Vitaly desperately tries to snort the cocaine out of the shag
pile
carpet - the straw constantly clogging with carpet fibers.
Blood oozes from Vitaly's nostril. Yuri gazes down at his pathetic
brother.
EXT.	ST. JOSEPH'S DRUG REHAB CLINIC.	DAY.
An exclusive rehab center.	A title appears:
Upstate New York -
1989
YURI's car pulls up outside, Vitaly in the passenger seat.
YURI
Get out of the car.
Vitaly doesn't budge.
YURI (cont'd)
I promised our parents.
VITALY
(desperate eyes)
Please.
YURI
Vitaly, you're going to have a good time. This is a top place. Two Ford models checked in last week and that cute weather girl's been here since July.
VITALY
Please.
Yuri relents, pours a gram onto the dashboard.	Vitaly snorts it
off
the dash.
VITALY
(as he wipes his nose)
You're a good brother.
Vitaly kisses Yuri.
Two ORDERLIES open the car door, escort Vitaly away.
Yuri watches his brother in the rearview mirror - shepherded up
the
path.
YURI (V.O.)
I never understood what separated the recreational drug user from the habitual, the functional addict from the dysfunctional. But for the grace of God, it could have been me snorting lines as long as the Belt Parkway.
INT.	CATHOLIC CHURCH - BRIGHTON BEACH.	DAY.
IRINA lights a candle in front of the Virgin Mary.
YURI (V.O.)
Vitaly never got completely clean despite
the prayers of my mother... 
INT.	SYNAGOGUE - BRIGHTON BEACH.	DAY.
ANATOLY prays in front of the menorah.
YURI (V.O.)
... and father. In fact, my younger brother was the only reason my father ever had to question his new religion.
INT.	AIR MAROC JETLINER.	DAY.
An EXECUTIVE sits in his Business Class seat.	On the tray table
in
front of him, calculator and spreadsheets.
YURI (V.O.)
After Colombia I became a one-man-operation. A sole proprietor as you say on your tax return - that is if you're foolish enough to fill one out.
He exchanges a collegial smile with YURI who has similar entrepreneurial paraphernalia in front of him.
YURI (V.O.)
By then I'd mastered my craft. Selling arms is not so different to selling vacuum cleaners. You advertise, pound the pavement, take orders.
The businessman's smile dissolves when he catches a glance at the brochure lying next to Yuri's "Day-Runner" - glossy photos of
GRENADE LAUNCHERS.
A MONTAGE OF SCENES - ILLUSTRATING THE ANATOMY OF AN ARMS DEAL.
It takes place in an unidentified country in North Africa.
YURI (V.O.)
Of course, a good arms dealer also has to be a political scientist. I go by a seven-step approach.
YURI gets off a plane.
YURI (V.O.)
One: identity a government and an opposition where the opposition is ignored.
YURI immediately picks up a newspaper, eager for the latest news.
YURI (V.O.)
Two: Wait for a radical group to break away from the opposition.
YURI is buoyed by the front page news, over-tips the NEWSPAPER SELLER.
YURI (V.O.)
Three: Immediately approach the radical group and offer them arms.
YURI meets a group of REVOLUTIONARIES in a backstreet bar, shows them an arms catalogue.
YURI (V.O.)
Four: Whether they buy or not, inform the government that the radical group approached you and offer the government arms.
YURI meets a GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL in the parliament buildings, shows
him the same catalogue.
YURI (V.O.)
Five: Whether they buy or not, re-approach the radical group and offer them more arms but now at a higher price. Increasing tension is a means of generating demand and the ideal situation is to sell to both sides.
YURI meets the REVOLUTIONARIES a second time in the same bar -
this
time they are more enthusiastic and Yuri has his calculator out.
YURI (V.O.)
Six: If they start shooting at each other, the escalation is underway.
YURI, now accompanied by bodyguards, is escorted into the government
buildings, where he's given a fat envelope.
Back at the bar, YURI is given an even fatter envelope.
YURI (V.O.)
They are consuming small arms and ammunition and the cash register is well and truly ringing.
YURI stands at his hotel window, sneaking a look through grimy venetian blinds. A street battle is taking place.
However, in Yuri's mind the sound of the gunshots is gradually replaced by the sound ot a cash register. Each time a gun is
fired,
the register rings.
Yuri shuts the window.
YURI (V.O.)
Seven: Don't forget that the success of a radical group in one country can inspire a radical group in a neighboring country.
Yuri boards a plane, taking off for a new conflict zone.
INT.	AIR MAROC JETLINER.	DAY.
YURI leans back in his Business Class seat - eyes closed. They suddenly blink open. He feels someone watching him.
Sure enough, he is face-to-face with AVA CORDOVA - staring at him from a magazine cover in the seat pocket next to him.
INT.	MODEL AGENCY.	DAY.
A gallery of MODELS from the late-eighties on VOGUE, HARPER'S BAZAAR, ELLE magazine covers, blown-up and framed on a white
wall.
An AGENT with a window-office overlooking Park Avenue talks on
the
phone.	In front of her, the headshot of AVA CORDOVA.
AGENT
(into phone)
--There's really no one else you'd consider? Christie and Brooke are both available... not the right look? It's just that Ava doesn't generally do print.
The agent examines an envelope stuffed with cash.
AGENT (cont'd)
However, since you are willing to double her rate and pay cash in advance. She loves working with Herb and you say the campaign will only be seen in Asia?
(examining a first class plane ticket Destination: St. Barts)
I certainly can't see her objecting to the location.
(inspecting an itinerary)
What is the product again... ?
INT.	ARMS SHOW CONVENTION HALL.	DAY.
YURI talks on a phone as he browses at an arms show.	He stops at
a
display of handguns.
YURI
(into phone)
The product?	Er,... Colt .45.
(a beat)
The beer.
INT.	EDEN ROCK HOTEL - ST. BARTHELEMY, FRENCH CARIBBEAN.	DAY.
An idyllic beachfront hotel.
AVA CORDOVA enters an empty reception area. The RECEPTIONIST hands
her a fax - Ava's face falls.
YURI sits by the deserted pool, observing her entrance.
YURI (V.O.)
It cost me twenty for the fake booking, another twelve to buy out the hotel. You can't force someone to tall in love with you but you can sure make ita damn sight easier.
INT.	HOTEL RESTAURANT.	DUSK.
A large restaurant overlooking the ocean.
AVA and YURI are the only guests, both eating alone.	They make
eye-
contact - exchange polite smiles.
EXT.	PRIVATE BEACH.	DAY.
AVA strolls down to the beach, deserted, save for YURI - sunbathing
some distance away on one of the hundred empty sunbeds.
Ava dives into the water.	Behind his sunglasses, Yuri watches
her.
LATER
Towelling off on a sunbed of her own, Ava glances over to Yuri.
It
seems crazy not to speak to each other.	Ava breaks the ice.
AVA
(calling to Yuri)
Popular hotel, huh?
Yuri smiles.	Ava approaches, extends a hand.
AVA (cont'd)
Ava Cordova.
YURI
Yuri Orlov.	What brings you to St. Barts?
AVA
A photo shoot. At least, that was the plan. But the photographer's plane got stuck in Miami. Hurricane - though there was nothing in the news.
YURI
(gazing out at the ocean)
Those things can come out of nowhere.
AVA
The job's cancelled and there's no flight back to New York 'til Tuesday.
Yuri pretends to ponder her predicament.
YURI
You can hitch a ride with me if you like.
Ava regards him cautiously - likes what she sees.
YURI (cont'd)
(picking up his own camera)
In the meantime, why don't I take your picture?
Ava smiles, poses playfully for him.
YURI (V.O.)
In my experience some of the most successful relationships are founded on lies and deceit. Since that's where they usually end up anyway, it's a logical place to start.
EXT.	ST. BARTHELEMY AIRPORT.	DAY.
A limousine approaches a Lear jet parked on the tarmac of the
one-
runway airport.	YURI and AVA exit the car.
YURI (V.O.)
I nearly went broke trying to convince her I was anything but. I knew Ava was not the kind of woman to be seduced by a ride in a private jet unless you owned the jet.
CLOSE ON the tail of the jet - the name "ORLOV AIR".
AVA
(holding her skirt in the wind to
protect her modesty)
This is your plane?
YURI
(shrug)
That is my name.
They enter the plane.
YURI (V.O.)
Of course I was lying. The plane was a rental, like the car and even the suit I was standing in. At the last minute, I bribed the crew for the paint-job.
As the plane picks up speed on the runway, the name "ORLOV" smears.
YURI (V.O.)
Luckily, by the time we landed, Ava wasn't looking anywhere but in my eyes.
INT.	LEAR JET.	DAY.
YURI and AVA sit beside each other on a white leather sofa in the customized cabin drinking Cristal champagne.
Yuri glances through Vogue magazine - a photo spread on Ava. Ava takes in the plane's sumptuous appointments.
YURI
(pretending to be impressed with
the photos)
I had no idea.
He hands her back the magazine.
YURI (cant'd)
I'm sorry I didn't recognize you. You must think me very rude.
AVA
Don't apologize. I put on clothes for a living.
YURI
(wry grin)
At least you aren't taking them off.
AVA
(smiling at his irreverence)
I would be if half the photographers had their way.
(shrug)
But I can't complain. I'm paid to say, "Cheese".
(meeting his gaze)
What about you?
YURI
Nothing so glamorous. I'm in transport - international air freight mostly.
AVA
What, like UPS or something?
YURI
Something like that.
AVA
(glance to her champagne flute)
Business is good.
YURI
Like you, I can't complain.
They both drink.	A thought occurs to Ava.
AVA
But if you did?
YURI
Well... I don't know.
(reluctant admission)
It's just that I travel all around the world but I can't help feeling sometimes that I'm going nowhere.
Ava regards him closely.	He's echoed her thoughts.	Yuri pours
Ava
another drink.
YURI (cont'd)
Here's to... 
(raising his glass)
... a hurricane.
They toast.
YURI (cont'd)
Without it, I'd never have met you.
She meets his eye.
AVA
This is no accident, is it, Yuri?
Yuri freezes - doesn't answer.
AVA (cont'd)
It feels like fate.
YURI
(never averting his eyes)
I don't believe in fate.
AVA
What do you believe in?
Yuri gazes at her a moment - he answers her question with a kiss.
Ava does not pull away.
INT.	LEAR JET - BEDROOM.	DAY.
CLOUDS rush by the faces of YURI and AVA, heads close to the plane's
oval windows.
They make love in a wall-to-wall bed built into the rear of the
jet.
The camera moves past the couple through one of the plane's windows,
and the clouds begin to rain.
EXT.	ISRAEL CENTRAL TEMPLE - BRIGHTON BEACH.	DAY.
Confetti. YURI and AVA run through the paper shower as they descend
the steps of a synagogue in Brighton Beach.
YURI (V.O.)
We married in a synagogue to make my father happy. In the eyes of my Catholic mother,
it was worse than living in sin.
Yuri and Ava kiss his parents, ANATOLY and IRINA.
As the happy couple reaches the limousine, VITALY - out of rehab
and
out of his mind - fires an AK-47 into the air as a salute.
The GUESTS drop to the ground - the only ones left standing are
Yuri
and Vitaly.
Yuri stares daggers at Vitaly, helps Ava to her feet.
YURI
(explaining to the guests)
It's traditional.
VITALY
(meekly echoing the remark -joke
badly misfired)
Traditional.
The guests nod, uncertain.
YURI (cant'd)
One more time, Vitaly.
Vitaly lets go another burst.
YURI (cont'd)
(reassuring word as he whisks Ava
into the car)
I'm sorry.	I should have said something.
INT.	UPPER EAST SIDE APARTMENT.	DAY.
YURI carries AVA over the threshold of their new home to cheers
of
the assembled GUESTS.
ANATOLY and IRINA gape in amazement at the grand house.	They
draw
their son aside.
ANATOLY
(touching his yarmulke)
Always remember, son, there's something above you.
YURI
(looking up, gently joking)
Sure, Dad. A forty-thousand dollar crystal chandelier.
Anatoly forces a smile.	Irina presses a gift into Yuri's hand.
YURI (cont'd)
Mom, we don't need anything.
IRINA
You need this.
Irina takes Anatoly's arm, they walk away.
Yuri, alone for a moment, opens the package - a small Roman Catholic
Bible, conveniently bookmarked at the Ten Commandments.
DISSOLVE
TO:
INT.	UPPER EAST SIDE APARTMENT.	DAY.
A newborn baby boy, NICOLAI, plays in the wrapping paper of opened
gifts beneath an extravagantly-decorated Christmas tree.
New York - December
25, 1991
YURI (V.O.)
I was still living way beyond my means, mortgaged to the hilt, using one credit card to payoff another. Anything to keep Ava in the style to which she had, thanks largely to me, become accustomed. Then suddenly all my Christmases came at once.
A family Christmas - Anatoly, Irina and Ava open gifts. Baby Nicolai
wriggles on a blanket, trying to reach a piece of tinsel.
ANATOLY
(to Irina, regarding a nativity
scene on a Christmas card)
Jesus was Jewish.	You're worshipping a Jew.
Irina ignores him. She regards a gift - a silver goblet set from Tiffany's.
IRINA
Ava, this is too much.
AVA
Yuri likes to spoil you.
Nicolai crawls an inch.	AVA beams proudly.
AVA
Nicki!	You did it.	Good boy!
ANATOLY
That's my grandson.
Ava looks around for Yuri.
AVA
(calling out)
Yuri. Don't you want to see what your son is doing?
No reply.	Ava wraps the piece of tinsel around the baby's head.
A loud shout from the other room.
YURI (O.C.)
Tak!	Tak!	Tak-fucking-tak!	(subtitle:
Yes!)
Ava scoops up the baby. With Anatoly and Irina, they go to investigate.
On the television, MIKHAIL GORBACHEV, is making his famous speech,
officially ending the Cold War.
Yuri kneels in front of the TV as if it is an altar.
ANATOLY
What the hell's the matter?
YURI
It's over!	It's over!
AVA
What's over?
YURI
The Cold War, the Soviet Union, the Evil Empire. Mikhail's saying "no mas". He's throwing in the towel. It's over.
Yuri kisses Ava, Nicolai, Anatoly, Irina, kisses the TV.
AVA
That's nice.
(referring to Nicolai)
Your son is crawling.
Yuri's too busy kissing Gorbachev's birthmark.
He gazes at the TV, revelling in the plan taking shape in his head.
LATER
In the living room, AVA and IRINA play with NICOLAI. YURI and ANATOLY drink Johnnie Walker Black label.
ANATOLY
(contemplating the day's events) At least there'll be religious freedom.
YURI
I think I'll go back for a visit.
(trying to sound casual)
Do you stay in touch with Uncle Dmitri?
ANATOLY
(face lighting up)
Dmitri Volkoff?	Now and then.
YURI
How is he?
ANATOLY
The luckiest man alive. You know he was one of the first men at Chernobyl. Off-duty, at his daughter's wedding, he was roaring drunk. He was the only one who survived. Later they found that alcohol in your blood resists radiation.
YURI
He's still a General in the army?
ANATOLY
Major General. He got promoted. Two of his rivals were also there that day. I told you - he's the luckiest man alive.
YURI
He may be luckier than you think.
Yuri goes to pour himself a drink.	Anatoly grabs his son's hand
the
way he did many years earlier.
ANATOLY
(lowering his voice)
We're not fools, Yuri. What's between you and your wife is your own business but I don't think you're going to Odessa to open a McDonald's.
(meeting his son's eye)
Is this how you want to be remembered?
YURI
(shrug)
You're only remembered when you're dead.
Yuri knocks back his vodka, tries to lighten the mood.
YURI (cont'd)
I'll bring you back some caviar.
ANATOLY
It's not kosher.
A crash. VITALY and a call-girl, ANGEL, dressed in a low-cut fairy
dress, stumble through the front door - both the worse for drink
and
drugs.
VITALY
Merry fucking Christmas!
Angel laughs. The family gazes at Vitaly and his friend, appalled.
ANATOLY
(paternal)
Vitaly, who is this?
ANGEL
Angel.
VITALY
Her name really is Angel.	She's a fairy.
(hoisting Angel)
Let's stick her on top of the Christmas tree.
Vitaly and Angel laugh.	No one else does.
Vitaly collapses on the floor.	Nicolai cries.
VITALY (cont' d)
(at a loss for anything better)
I love you all.
Yuri firmly escorts Angel to the door and pays her off.
EXT.	ST. JOSEPH'S DRUG REHAB CLINIC - UPSTATE NEW YORK.	DAY.
YURI drops VITALY back at the exclusive rehab center.
By now Yuri knows the routine. He pours a gram onto the dashboard.
YURI
I'm going back to Ukraine.
Vitaly snorts it off the dash.
VITALY
(maudlin)
I miss Odessa.	I miss you.
YURI
I miss you too.
Vitaly kisses Yuri.
VITALY (cont'd)
(meeting his brother's eye)
Be careful, Yuri. Those things you sell, kill... 
(tapping Yuri's chest where his
heart should be)
... inside.
Two ORDERLIES open the car door, escort Vitaly away. Yuri stares after Vitaly.
INT.	UPPER EASTSIDE APARTMENT.	DAY.
AVA and NICKI kiss YURI goodbye.
EXT./INT.	PUBLIC STORAGE FACILITY - MANHATTAN.	MORNING.
YURI enters a public storage facility, opens a locker with a combination lock.
YURI (V.O.)
There's no problem leading a double life. It's the triple and quadruple lives that get you in the end.
He produces several passports from the locker, shuffles the passports like playing cards.
YURI (V.O.)
Back then I carried a French, British, Israeli and
Ukrainian passport and a student visa for the
U.S., but that's another story.
The locker also contains five identical briefcases - presumably
he
can tell them apart.
YURI (V.O.)
I also packed five different briefcases depending on the region of the world I was visiting.
EXT.	BORDER CHECKPOINT - IZMAYIL, UKRAINE.	DAY.
Light snow falls. YURI, driving a brand new Mercedes, waits in a long line of cars at the border.
Izmayil, Ukraine -
January, 1992
YURI (V.O.)
The end of the Cold War was the beginning of the hottest time in arms dealing. The Wall had fallen. The arms bazaar was open.
Those forty-five years had generated the highest weapons build-up in history. The Soviets had tanks and guns coming out the demon hole - huge stockpiles and now no enemy.
A Border Guard approaches Yuri's car window.
BORDER GUARD
(in English, checking Yuri's
passport)
Visa?
Yuri hands the Guard his passport. Inside, a credit card emblazoned, "VISA".
The guard smiles.
BORDER GUARD (cont'd)
Cash or check only.
Yuri smiles, hands him several U.S. bills.	Yuri's passport is
promptly stamped.	He is waved past the line of cars.
YURI
It's good to be home.
EXT.	ODESSA MILITARY BASE.	DAY.
YURI, briefcase in hand, meets his Uncle DMITRI at a barracks.
(NB:
Dmitri always carries a hip flask of vodka as if there is a constant
threat of radiation poisoning.)
DMITRI
Nephew, come here and hug the luckiest man alive.
The General gives him a great bear hug. Dmitri registers the apprehensive look on Yuri's face.
DMITRI (cont'd)
What? Did you think I'd be glowing? Don't worry. You can't catch it.
Yuri kisses Dmitri on the cheek to reassure him. Over his shoulder,
Dmitri notices the car.
DMITRI
(referring to the car)
This is the SLK?
YURI
0 - 60 in 4.8.
Dmitri is impressed.
INT.	ODESSA MILITARY BASE - OFFICE.	DAY.
YURI has a stack of VCR's, cartons of cigarettes, Johnnie Walker Black Label on the table in front of DMITRI who drinks from his
hip
flask throughout the conversation.
DMITRI
I can't just sell you government property,
Yuri.	I have to report--
YURI
--Report to who? Moscow? As of last week Moscow is in a foreign country.
DMITRI
(shrug)
New flag, new boss.
YURI
There is no new boss yet. They're too busy squabbling over who gets the presidential holiday home at the Black Sea.
Dmitri can't deny it.
YURI (cont'd)
(talking like an evangelist)
It's beautiful. The ones who know don't care any more. The ones who care don't know.
(nodding to a safe built
into the floor)
Show me your inventory.
Dmitri hesitates, knocks back his vodka, then opens the safe - produces a document.
INT.	ODESSA MILITARY BASE - ARMORY.	DAY.
Crates of machine guns from floor to ceiling.	DMITRI gives YURI
a
tour of the armory.
YURI
How many Kalashnikovs do you have?
DMITRI
(referring to the inventory in
his hand)
40,000.
YURI
(looking over Dmitri's shoulder)
Is that a "4"?	It doesn't look like a "4"
to me.	It looks more like a "1".
DMITRI
(missing the point)
No, it's a "4".
YURI
It's whatever we say it is because no one else knows the difference.
Dmitri finally gets it.	Yuri examines a Kalashnikov.
YURI (cont'd)
10,000 Kalashnikovs for a battalion. Your stocks are dangerously depleted, Dmitri. You should order more from the factory.
This is too much for Dmitri.	He stops, confronts Yuri - takes
back
the AK-47 Yuri is inspecting.
DMITRI
Someone will work this out, Yuri. What happens then?
YURI
(shrug)
We'll cut them in. Anyway, what could happen - you're the luckiest man alive.
EXT.	ODESSA MILITARY BASE.	DUSK.
The sun sets over a grassy field. YURI sits alone - closely inspects a Kalashnikov.
It is a strange moment between a man and his favorite gun.
As we hear Yuri's thoughts, we are treated to lovingly shot close ups of the weapon and its features often seen in slow motion:
Sun
glistening off the chromed barrel. Folding metal stock arcing elegantly into place. Precise docking of the 30-round curved magazine.
YURI (V.O.)
Avtomat Kalashnikova, model of 1947 - more commonly known as the AK-47 or Kalashnikov. It's the world's most popular assault ritle
-	a weapon all fighters love. An elegantly simple nine pound amalgamation of forged steel and molded plastic. It doesn't break, jam or over-heat. It will shoot whether its covered in mud or filled with sand. It's so easy, even a child can use it. And they do. The Russians put the gun on a coin. Mozambique put it on their flag. Since the end of the Cold War, the Kalashnikov has become the Russian peoples' greatest export
-	after that comes vodka and suicidal novelists. One thing's for sure, no one was lining up to buy their cars.
We reveal where Yuri is sitting - on the roof of a rusting Russian
sedan, the Vaz 4-door.	A goat is eating the upholstery.
Yuri checks on the crates of AK-47's being loaded into a convoy
of
trucks. In the background, the armory, full a week ago, is now virtually empty. Yuri smiles a satisfied smile.
His reverie is interrupted by the sound of a car horn.
A commotion at the gate. Another large, black Mercedes is parked there, DRIVER leaning on the horn.
YURI smiles as he sees the passenger emerge from the car - SIMEON ZAHAROFF.
YURI (V.O.)
Of course my idea was not entirely unique.
I had rivals.
Simeon angrily confronts the SOLDIER at the gate.
DMITRI puts on his cap, about to investigate.	YURI stops him.
YURI
He's a friend of mine.
Dmitri shrugs and complies.	Yuri strides towards the gate.
EXT.	ODESSA MILITARY BASE - GATE.	DUSK.
SIMEON, flanked by two hefty BODYGUARDS, is in the face of a
YOUNG
OFFICER.
The Officer is flanked by three SOLDIERS, Kalashnikovs resting on their hips.
SIMEON
Do you know who the fuck I am?
OFFICER
(thick Ukrainian accent)
Who the fuck cares who the fuck you are?
SIMEON
I demand to see your commanding officer.
OFFICER
You don't demand shit.
Simeon reconsiders his position.
SIMEON
Just give me back my papers.
OFFICER
(papers clearly visible in his
hand)
What papers?
The Officer turns on his heel and returns to his guard station
with
the passport, starts watching TV.	The Bodyguards make to follow
but
the Soldiers close ranks, barring their path.
Simeon fumes.
YURI (O.C.)
You're late, Simeon.
YURI breezes past the Soldiers with an easy familiarity. He enters
the guard station as if he owns it.
From beside his car, Simeon watches as Yuri jovially discusses
the
situation with the Young Officer. After a moment Yuri slips the Officer money in exchange for Simeon's passport.
Yuri emerges from the station and returns the passport to the veteran gunrunner.
YURI (cont'd)
I invited you for a drink once before.
Perhaps now you will accept my invitation.
INT.	ODESSA HOTEL BAR.	NIGHT.
YURI and SIMEON sit at a table near the back of the bar. Yuri flirts with
the BARMAID delivering drinks and a shellfish appetizer.
BARMAID
(to Yuri, impressed)
You sell guns?
YURI
Maybe you'd like to come to my room and see my bazooka.
The Barmaid giggles and exits.
Simeon is clearly disquieted by the change in the balance of power or
maybe it's the bad early-nineties pop music. His BODYGUARDS sit at the table behind.
