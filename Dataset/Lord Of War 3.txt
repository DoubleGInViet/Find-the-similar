YURI
You look a little lost, Simeon. Is the world changing too fast?
SIMEON
I am here, aren't I?
YURI
Not all of you, I think.
Simeon's look begs explanation.
YURI (cont'd)
You've gotten so rich selling for the CIA, you can't get that ideology completely out of your head. The empire was evil for too long.
Simeon shrugs.
SIMEON
I can't deny, it takes some getting used to. Last week we were trying to beat their brains in and now we're going into business together.
YURI
There's no place in gunrunning for politics anymore, Simeon. I sell to leftists, rightists. I'd sell to pacifists but they're not the most regular of customers.
Yuri leans forward.
YURI (cont'd)
Of course, you're not a true internationalist until you've supplied weapons to kill your own countrymen.
Simeon regards the young man with a mixture of fear and admiration pours
himself another drink.
SIMEON
I understand you have Ukraine in your pocket but there are the other satellite states. Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Belarus. Instead
of cutting each other's throats, it may be more profitable to work together. What do you think?
Yuri smiles - the proposal is the victory he has been seeking.
YURI
I think you are the amateur now. I think you suffer from a philosophical disadvantage
-	you have a philosophy. I think you should go with your instincts - your first instinct.
Simeon is confused.
YURI (cont'd)
I am the same man who was not good enough for you before. I am not good enough for you now.
Simeon blanches.	Yuri gets up.
Simeon holds his rival's arm.
SIMEON
The problem with gunrunners going to war is there's no shortage of ammunition.
Yuri departs.
INT.	HOTEL ROOM - ODESSA HOTEL.	NIGHT.
YURI and the BARMAID never make it to the bed. Still clothed, they bang
each other against the door of his hotel room.
YURI (V.O.)
Back then, it was all for sale... 
EXT.	UKRAINE MILITARY BASE.	DAY.
Row after row of tanks, armored personnel carriers and helicopter gunships in mothballs.
YURI (V.O.)
Helicopters, torpedo boats, armored personnel carriers, whole tank divisions.
DMITRI, flask in hand, and YURI are given a tour of the surplus hardware
by one of Dmitri's brother officers.
UKRAINE MAJOR
(haggling over the gunships)
--I'll tell you what I'll do. Buy six, you get one free.
YURI
What about tech support?
UKRAINE MAJOR
No problem.
Yuri and Dmitri come upon an oily-faced BOY, perched on the cockpit
of a helicopter gunship - he wears an ill-fitting uniform, several
sizes too big.
YURI
Son, get off there before you get hurt.
UKRAINE MAJOR
(sheepish)
He's the tech support.
YURI
(incredulous)
He's twelve.
UKRAINE MAJOR
Thirteen.	Almost fourteen.
DMITRI
(shrug)
Kids grow up fast around here.
UKRAINE MAJOR
(nodding to the gunship)
He can take it apart in his sleep.
Yuri shrugs, shakes the Major's hand.
EXT.	HILL OVERLOOKING ODESSA HARBOR.	DAY.
THE POV FROM A PAIR OF BINOCULARS - in the crosshairs, JACK VALENTINE, at a surprise checkpoint, staring through binoculars
of
his own.
YURI (O.C.)
Who are you?
YURI, on his belly to avoid detection, slithers back to the roadway
- hands the binoculars to a YOUNG SOLDIER.
DMITRI stands beside the convoy of trucks parked barely out of
view
of the checkpoint, including Yuri's Mercedes and a huge open-bed tractor-trailer carrying a Russian Hind helicopter gunship.
YURI (cont'd)
(angrily to Dmitri)
I thought we were supposed to be watching for these checkpoints.
DMITRI
How can I?	You keep selling my helicopters.
You're too greedy, Yuri.
YURI
(anxious)
We have to go back.
Dmitri regards the trucks, each one longer than the road is wide.
DMITRI
We'll be going in reverse. We can't turn around for a mile.
The YOUNG SOLDIER on lookout calls to them.
YOUNG SOLDIER
They're coming.
Yuri grabs the binoculars. Sure enough, Valentine and his agents are climbing into their Interpol Jeeps and driving towards them.
DMITRI
We shoot it out?
YURI
(shaking his head)
And start an international fucking incident - no, no, no.
DMITRI
So we run.
YURI
No.	I've got paperwork.
DMITRI
(protesting)
Not for the gunship. Yuri, you know the penalty for sanction-busting - selling a military helicopter?
Yuri gazes at the Russian Mi-24V helicopter gunship, bristling
with
armaments.
YURI
It's not a military helicopter. It's a rescue helicopter.
Yuri turns to the Boy referred to as "tech support".
YURI (cant' d)
Get to work, Son.
The boy pulls a wrench from his pocket.
SEVERAL MINUTES LATER
The Interpol Jeeps crest the rise and pull in front of the convoy
-
VALENTINE and his agents exit, guns drawn.
DMITRI and the UKRAINIAN SOLDIERS stiffen, their weapons also at
the
ready.	An uneasy stand-off.
YURI gestures for calm. He greets Valentine warmly - offers his hand.
YURI
Yuri Orlov.
In reply, an Interpol Agent unceremoniously slams Yuri into the
side
of his truck.
VALENTINE
(flashing ID)
Papers.
Again Yuri waves off Dmitri and his men, about to come to his
aid.
Yuri courteously hands over his passport and other documentation
to
the skeptical Valentine.
VALENTINE (cont'd)
(regarding the photo closely)
Mr. Orlov, always in the wrong place at the
right time. We've met before. Off the coast of Colombia.
(feigning memory loss)
What was the name of that freighter - I can't remember. Was it the Kono or the Kristol?
YURI
(hesitates, he's actually forgotten)
The crew called that vessel a lot of names - none of them repeatable in polite company.
Valentine turns his attention to the helicopter - now devoid of
its
weapons.	An Interpol Agent escorts Yuri at gunpoint.
YURI (cont'd)
(noting to the gun in his ribs)
The new MP-5. Do you need a silencer for that?
Valentine ignores the banter, inspects Yuri's documentation.
VALENTINE
The end-user certificate for this aircraft states Burkina Faso. Nice. Did you type it yourself?
YURI
It's for humanitarian missions.
VALENTINE
You're a humanitarian?
Yuri shrugs - why not?
VALENTINE (cont'd)
(not buying it for a second)
This is a killing machine.
YURI
Not any more.
DMITRI
(in broken English)
Listen to the nephew.
It's true.	Yuri has had the armaments detached.
YURI
Didn't you get the memo?	The war's over.
What can they do with military hardware but
convert to civilian use?
DMITRI
What, yes?
YURI
(trying to lighten the mood)
The only way you could die from this baby is if a food drop hits you.
Valentine's face hardens at the flippant remark.
Still at gunpoint, Yuri is escorted to the smaller second truck
in
the convoy. Stacked inside the container are the helicopter's hurriedly removed missiles and the Boy.
VALENTINE
(referring to the missiles)
Also going to Burkina Faso?
YURI
(pointing to the document)
But to a different client at a different address.
Valentine, incensed, throws Yuri up against the truck himself.
VALENTINE
What do you take me for? A complete fucking fool?
YURI
(eyeing Valentine's gun pressed to
his throat)
Not complete, Sir. And while I hesitate to tell you your job, I must point out that when shipped separately the weapons and the aircraft both comply with the current Interpol trade standards and practices.
VALENTINE
(incredulous)
You expect me to believe this is a
coincidence?
YURI
I can see how certain people might interpret it as suspicious but thank God we live in a world where suspicion alone does not constitute a crime.
Valentine regards Yuri closely - this foe is more formidable than
he
imagined.
Valentine looks to the gun in his hand, contemplating crossing
the
line.	He finally holsters his gun.
VALENTINE
(tosses the documents on the road) Yuri Orlov. You and I are going to be seeing a lot of each other.
YURI
I can hardly wait.
VALENTINE
(climbing into his Jeep)
Watch out for the time you don't see me.
Yuri, Dmitri and the Boy watch Valentine speed away.
BOY
(perfect American accent)
What an asshole.
Yuri looks to the boy, askance - a Yuri in the making.
EXT.	ODESSA HARBOR.	DAY.
YURI supervises the loading of the cargo onto a freighter. Checking
the empty trucks, he is just in time to see SIMEON and his HENCHMEN
climb into their car, parked beside his own car, some distance away.
As he drives off, Simeon and Yuri make brief eye-contact.
Yuri looks for DMITRI, exiting a nearby restroom - carrying his
hip
flask as usual, the worse for drink.
YURI
(referring to the departing
Simeon)
What was he doing here?
DMITRI
(zipping his pants)
Trying to beat your offer. I sent him on his way. He doesn't understand the concept
of loyalty.
Dmitri glances at the SOLDIERS around the docks.
DMITRI (cont'd)
Speaking of loyalty, too many people know.
I have to make pay-offs.
YURI
Don't worry. There're more VCR's. I left them in your new car.
Dmitri's face lights up.	Yuri hands him the keys to the SKL.
DMITRI
Even your enemy was admiring that car. I am the luckiest man alive.
Dmitri hands his hip flask to Yuri.	Yuri watches Dmitri walk to
the
car and climb in for a test drive.
A look of realization on Yuri's face.
YURI
(screaming to Dmitri)
Dmit--!!!
The car erupts as if it has been punched by a fist beneath the earth.
Recovered from the blast, Yuri runs up to the burning car but is beaten back by the flames.
DISSOLVE
TO:
EXT.	DOCKS.	NIGHT.
CLOSE ON a bent Mercedes medallion, now worn around the BOY's neck.
He regards it forlornly.
YURI, numb, still carrying Dmitri's hip flask, makes a call from
a
payphone.
INT.	UPPER EAST SIDE APARTMENT - MANHATTAN.	DAY.
A darkened bedroom.	AVA is fast asleep in her bed, curled up
with
NICOLAI.
The phone rings.	Half-asleep, Ava reaches for it.
AVA
(still groggy)
Yes, I'll accept the charges.
We cut between the two sides of the conversation.
YURI
Ava--
AVA
Hey, baby.
(glancing to a clock - 3am)
You forgotten what time it is?
YURI
Sorry.	I, er... 
(talking about anything other than
what's on his mind)
How was your audition?
AVA
(resigned smile)
They're going in another direction. The direction of someone who can act.
YURI
Don't say that.	You're good.
AVA
And you're biased.
Ava grabs her robe - goes to the balcony so as not to disturb Nicolai.
AVA
(sensing something amiss)
Where are you?	Is everything okay?
YURI
Rough day at the office.
AVA
Come home.	We miss you.
YURI
Soon.
(more desperate than he intended)
How's Nicki?
AVA
Asleep in our bed.	It's lonely without you.
From a bar down the street comes the sound of gunfire - MOBSTERS firing at other MOBSTERS escaping in a car.
Yuri tries to cover the phone but Ava overhears.
AVA (cont'd)
Yuri, what's that?
YURI
A party.
AVA
It's always a party where you are.
More gunfire interrupts.
YURI
I'd better go. I just wanted to call--hear your voice. Kiss Nicki for me.
AVA
I love you.
But Yuri has gone.
EXT.	ODESSA HARBOR.	DAY.
The freighter slips out of the harbor.
YURI (V.O.)
In Ukraine since 1992, $32 billion worth of arms have been stolen and re-sold. One of the greatest heists of the 20th Century.
EXT.	DOCKSIDE - MONROVIA.	DAY.
Crates of munitions are unloaded from the freighter onto waiting trucks under YURI's supervision.
YURI (V.O.)
The primary market was Africa.	Eleven major
conflicts
involving 32 countries in the past decade - a gunrunner's wet dream.
Yuri sizes up the MILITIAMEN loading the arms.
YURI (V.O.)
My best customer was self-declared president
of Liberia, Andre Baptiste. Even though we'd met before, I was in no hurry to meet him again. He'd gotten a reputation for routinely hacking off the limbs of those who opposed him. His seven-year civil war has been described as "a relentless campaign of sadistic, wanton violence unimaginable to those unfamiliar with the details of man's capacity to visit the abyss." That kind of sums up Andy for me.
As the final truck door is secured, a customized Lincoln Continental convertible comes flying around a corner - stereo blaring, deliberately terrorizing the locals on the dock.
The car slides to a stop beside Yuri. It contains ANDRE BAPTISTE JNR., a handsome young man with sunglasses, a mirror for an earring and a facial tattoo. Also in the car, two BODYGUARDS and a pair of LIBERIAN TEENAGE GIRLS dressed in Dallas Cowboy cheerleader uniforms.
ANDRE JNR.
Mr. Yuri, I am Andre Baptiste Junior. My father would like to meet you.
YURI
Thank him but I have other business. A busy schedule.
ANDRE JNR.
It is not optional. My father is easily offended.
Yuri ponders for a moment. The machete in the Bodyguard's hand makes up his mind.
YURI
What do you know?	My schedule just freed up.
A bodyguard takes Yuri's suitcase. Yuri is barely in the car before
it screeches away.
As the car roars along the highway on the edge of control, we
hear
Yuri's thoughts.
YURI (V.O.)
But if I thought I was scared of Andre Senior, I knew I was scared of Andre Junior. Like father, like son. The guava doesn't fall too far from the tree. He was a heavy-
drinker, a womanizer with a penchant for cheerleaders and a lover of fast American automobiles which he drove recklessly and with total impunity around the streets of the capital. Oh yes, he was also a cannibal. They say Andre would eat a victim's heart while it was still beating to give him superhuman strength. I could've told him he'd get the same effect from a pastrami sandwich at Carnegie's Deli.
Andre announces his arrival in the main street of Monrovia with a burst of gunfire. The city, a violent clash of cultures. Goats
and
Gucci.
YURI (V.O.)
Monrovia itself was like being on another planet. Planet Monrovia. From the temperature it was obviously a planet close to the sun. I rarely saw another white man even at my hotel that was soon dubbed the "Little Kremlin". And I never left town alone. Outside town, was the edge of hell. I didn't want to even gaze into it.
The car pulls up to Monrovia's premier hotel. A DEAD BODY on the ground attracts no attention whatsoever.
ANDRE JNR.
This is your hotel.
(proudly)
Two stars.
A PORTER, carrying Yuri's suitcase, steps over the dead body.
ANDRE JNR. (cont'd)
(to Yuri)
Can you bring me the gun of Rambo?
YURI
Part One, Two or Three?
ANDRE JNR.
(confused)
I have only seen Part One.
YURI
(nodding)
The M60. You want the attachable grenade launcher?
ANDRE JNR.
Please.	And the armor piercing bullets.
(revving the car)
I will be back to get you in an hour... or two. It's Liberia.
(mischievous smile)
We left a welcoming present in your room.
Yuri nods, uncertainly.
INT.	HOTEL AFRICA - LIBERIA.	DAY.
YURI enters the hotel.
At the reception desk, two HOTEL PORTERS watch a small, portable
TV
-	CNN coverage of the O.J. Simpson trial - gruesome evidence photos.
HOTEL PORTER #1
(never averting his eyes from the
screen)
My God, he nearly cut off her head.
HOTEL PORTER #2
When I get to America, I will not live in
Brentwood.
The CONCIERGE hands Yuri a key.
INT.	HALLWAY / HOTEL ROOM.	DAY.
YURI goes to open his hotel room door - hears music from inside, enters.
Two stunning LIBERIAN GIRLS sit naked on the bed bopping to Madonna's lILike A Prayer".
YURI (V.O.)
In the most AIDS infested region of the globe, where one in four is infected, Andre's idea of a joke was to put a young Iman and a young Naomi naked in my bed and no condom within a hundred miles.
GLORIA
Hello, Mr. Yuri.
FAITH
We'd be happy to make you happy.
The two goddesses drape themselves around him.
GLORIA
Don't worry, we don't have anything.
YURI
How do you know?
FAITH
Do we look like it?
YURI
(fending them off but with little
commitment)
What if I have AIDS?	Don't you worry?
Gloria's lips gently touch his.
GLORIA
You worry too much.
Faith begins to unbutton his shirt.
FAITH
(sultry)
Why worry about something that can kill you in ten years when there are so many things that can kill you today?
Gloria's hands go to his belt buckle, start to unfasten it.
GLORIA
How can we make you happy?
With great reluctance Yuri reaches behind him and opens the door.
YURI
By leaving.
EXT.	HOTEL - CORRIDOR.	DAY.
FAITH and GLORIA, still buck-naked, are tossed into the hallway, their clothes flung after them, door slammed shut.
INT.	BAPTISTE'S PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE - MONROVIA.	DAY.
A Glock .45, Heckler & Koch .40 and a Beretta 9mm sitm on the ostentatious
mahogany desk in front of President of Liberia, ANDRE BAPTISTE - a few
pounds heavier, still wearing the same size uniform. ANDRE JNR. watches
over his shoulder.
Andre Baptiste examines each handgun methodically.
In front of him, a pensive YURI, taking in his surroundings. Half a
dozen gun-toting ELITE GUARDS keep an idle watch. Several HOSTESSES tend
to a refreshments table. On a nearby sofa, a LIEUTENANT flirts with one
of the hostesses.
Baptiste glances over to the Lieutenant, irritated.
YURI
(providing a commentary)
--that's the Beretta, comes with a 36
cartridge, easy-operating clip--
Baptiste tests the loading mechanism.
The Lieutenant on the sofa is still not paying attention.
Baptiste casually points the gun at the Lieutenant and shoots him
in
the head - a large portion of his brain splattering across the fleur-de-lis wallpaper.
YURI (cont'd)
(shocked)
Jesus, why did you do that?
Baptiste, clearly not used to having his actions questioned, turns
the gun on Yuri.	He's next.
BAPTISTE
What did you say?
Yuri, staring down the barrel of the Beretta, recovers fast.
YURI
(feigning anger, gesturing at the
gun)
Now you're going to have to buy it. (grabbing the gun from Baptiste)
It's a used gun.	I can't sell a used gun.
Baptiste is taken aback.	He suddenly bursts into laughter.
BAPTISTE
A used gun.	That's a good one.
The other Officers laugh uncertainly.
The Lieutenant's body is dragged out - leaving a smear of blood across the marble floor.
Baptiste, seemingly oblivious to the carnage he's wreaked, resumes
talking to Yuri, in a measured way as if he's discussing the sad state of punctuality in contemporary society.
BAPTISTE (cant'd)
(confiding in Yuri)
There's no discipline with the young boys.
I try to set an example but it's difficult.
I blame the MTV.
Yuri nods, disguising his terror.
Baptiste, checking his Rolex Oyster, rises from his desk.
BAPTISTE (cont'd)
Let me show you something.
EXT.	BAPTISTE'S PRESIDENTIAL MANSION.	DAY.
The camera tracks along the MILITIA - however only the very tops
of
their heads are visible.
YURI (V.O.)
I had heard of the "Boy Brigades", "Small Boy Units", "Kalashnikov Kids". The theory was that a bullet coming from a fourteen year old is just as effective as one trom a forty year old.
ANDRE BAPTISTE haggles with YURI as he inspects his troops ranging
from twelve to fourteen. Yuri, averts his eyes from the boys, uncomfortable reviewing soldiers a head shorter than he.
OLDER SOLDIERS fill the ranks behind.
BAPTISTE
I can't pay your asking price, Yuri. We are not a rich people and the market is already flooded with your Kalashnikovs. In some places you can buy one for the price of a chicken.
YURI
You can't just look at the unit price.	You
forget the ancillary costs. End user certificates need to be forged and notarized, shell companies set up, insurance purchased, pilots and crews hired. Not to mention the bribes. You can't get a nut and bolt out of the Eastern bloc without a bribe. There's one bribe for the nut. Another for the bolt. This is an expensive proposition.
Andre interrogates Yuri's eyes.
BAPTISTE
I pay in timber... or stones.
Baptiste produces a handful of uncut diamonds from his pocket. Yuri's eyes
widen at the sight of the very precious stones.
YURI
(regarding the stones)
I'll take the stones. It's hard to get a tree trunk in my hand luggage.
Andre smiles.	He turns to his new Lieutenant.
BAPTISTE
(referring to the inspection)
Very professional, Lieutenant.
LIEUTENANT
(dismissing the troops)
Dismissed!
Yuri and Andre watch the troops disperse.
YURI
I know you're planning a new offensive. If you delay a week I can get you the armored personnel carriers we talked about. They would give you a significant strategic advantage.
Andre nods, grateful for the free tactical advice - regards Yuri
in
a new light.
BAPTISTE
They say I am the lord of war. But perhaps it is you.
YURI
(correcting him)
It's not "lord of war".	It's "warlord".
BAPTISTE
I like it my way.
Andre smiles again.	They are going to be fast friends.
He leaves Yuri alone to examine his uncut diamonds in his hand.
YURI (V.O.)
Diamonds are far less bulky than hundred-dollar bills. You can get a million dollars into a cigarette box.
EXT.	ART GALLERY - MANHATTAN.	DUSK.
A GO-BETWEEN emerges from a gallery with a wrapped painting, hands it to
YURI, waiting in a limo.
YURI (V.O.)
By the mid-nineties, my wealth had caught up to my lies about my wealth - even surpassed the lies.
Yuri pays the Go-Between in cash, places the painting in the trunk.
INT.	LIVING ROOM - NEW YORK APARTMENT.	NIGHT.
YURI enters the front door, drops his luggage at the door.
AVA, talking excitedly on the phone, hangs up, runs to greet him. VITALY, in the background, cocktail in hand, with another
dubious-
looking GIRLFRIEND, is examining another of Ava's paintings.
AVA
Yuri, I just got off the phone with the dealer. I sold my first painting.
Yuri and Vitaly greet each other with a nod.
YURI
(feigning surprise)
Fantastic.	Who bought it?
AVA
Someone important. They want to remain anonymous.
(asking in a way that does not
expect an answer)
How was your trip?
YURI
You know.	Same old, same old.
(quickly changing the subject)
Where's Nicki, in bed?
AVA
I'm sorry. Poor darling. He tried to stay up.
YURI
I'll kiss him goodnight.
VITALY
(opening champagne)
This calls for a drink.
YURI
What doesn't?
AVA
(still giddy at the news)
My first painting. I'm officially an artist!
He watches Ava showing off more of her paintings to Vitaly and
the
latest girlfriend.
YURI (V.O.)
I figured I was a patron of the arts and of everything else Ava had tried and failed at after modelling. Acting, her own cosmetics line. I didn't sabotage her careers but I can't deny it was convenient for me in maintaining a low profile. She was a beautiful bird in a gilded cage.
INT.	BEDROOM - NEW YORK APARTMENT.	NIGHT.
YURI kisses his sleeping son, NICOLAI, now three years old.
He places a gift at the end of his bed - an expensive-looking microscope.
At the same time he spies an object in Nicolai's toy box - a toy gun.
INT.	KITCHEN / LIVING ROOM - NEW YORK APARTMENT.	NIGHT.
YURI tosses the toy gun in the trash.
VITALY, still in the kitchen, catches him - pretends he didn't
see.
YURI
How are you, brother?
VITALY
(shrug)
You know, still the resident family fuck-up.
YURI
Someone has to do it.
They watch Ava in the living room sharing a joke with Vitaly's girlfriend.
VITALY
She knows, right?
YURI
We don't talk about it.
Vitaly looks askance.
YURI (cont'd)
(shrug)
How many car salesmen talk about their work, how many executives at cigarette companies? And both of their products kill more people every year than mine. At least mine has a safety switch. If those guys can leave their work at the office, why can't I?
VITALY
Shit, you're good. You almost had me convinced.
(to his girlfriend, knocking back
his drink)
We're going, baby.
LATER
Yuri and Ava are alone at the window, overlooking Central Park.
He
hands her a fresh glass of champagne.
YURI
(raising his glass for a toast)
To Manet, Monet... and Ava Cordova.
Ava grins, goes to drink when she notices two huge diamond earrings
laying at the bottom of the glass.
AVA
(gasp)
Yuri!
YURI
(shrug)
The trip went better than expected.
AVA
(fishing out the damp baubles)
Yuri, they're beautiful.
(flirtacious grin)
But what am I going to wear them with?
YURI
(flirting back)
I know just the outfit.
They kiss.
INT.	BEDROOM - NEW YORK APARTMENT.	NIGHT.
CLOSE UP on the diamonds dangling from AVA's ears. She wears the earrings and nothing else as she and YURI make love.
YURI (V.O.)
I didn't know how much she knew and how much she ignored. I was a good provider and as far as she was concerned - loyal. Despite the other women, I always made love to Ava as if she was the only one.
INT.	HELICOPTER - MANHATTAN.	MORNING.
From an unmarked helicopter, JACK VALENTINE and his INTERPOL AGENTS
shadow a Mercedes sedan as it weaves through midtown traffic.
INT.	SEDAN.	MORNING.
YURI rides in the back seat of the sedan, scouring the world affairs
sections of several newspapers.
A thought interrupts his homework.
He opens the sunroof a crack, spies the helicopter tailing the
car.
He closes the roof.
YURI
(to the DRIVER)
Take Park.
EXT.	PARK AVENUE.	MORNING.
The sedan enters the underpass beneath the Helmsley building - for a
moment the car hidden from aerial surveillance.
YURI
(to the Driver)
This is good.
The Driver pulls over, never coming to a complete stop before
Yuri
bails.	Horns blare at the illegal drop-off.
YURI (cont'd)
(to the Driver from the sidewalk)
Take them on a tour of the Tri-State.
Yuri grabs Ava's painting from the trunk and the sedan pulls back out into daylight minus Yuri - the occupants of the helicopter
none
the wiser.
Yuri hails a taxi.
INT.	HELICOPTER - MANHATTAN.	MORNING.
VALENTINE observes the sedan cruising through the heart of Yonkers.
VALENTINE
Where in God's name is he going? Is he lost?
INT.	PUBLIC STORAGE FACILITY.	MORNING.
With some reverence, YURI props Ava's painting against the wall
of
his private sanctuary, then goes about his business - shuffling passports, deciding who he will be.
EXT.	NEW YORK APARTMENT.	DAY.
AVA, dressed in a robe, all smiles, pours herself a cup of coffee.
She sips the coffee at the window, glances down.
In the courtyard below, INTERPOL AGENTS are picking through the garbage cans under the supervision of AGENT VALENTINE. Valentine curiously examines the toy gun.
The smile is wiped off Ava's face.	She makes brief eye-contact
with
Valentine before stepping back from the window.
Slightly shaken, she picks up the phone and dials.
AVA
(into phone)
Vitaly... it's Ava.
INT.	COCKPIT - ILYUSHIN-76 CARGO PLANE.	DAY.
The cargo hold of an Ilyushin-76 cargo plane. It's so overflowing
with weapons, many are strapped into the passenger seats.
Sierra Leone -
1999
YURI (V.O.)
I was now the best merchant of death alive. I didn't own my own plane. I owned a fleet - running guns into Liberia, Sierra Leone or the Ivory Coast at least once a week. Unfortunately, my friends at Interpol were also starting to find West Africa on the map. Most trips I had phoney paperwork. If the deadline was tight, I had no paperwork at all.
In the cockpit, an American PILOT and CO-PILOT keep an idle watch
on
their instruments as they fly over the endless plains of Sierra Leone. YURI sits in the jump-seat, reading the Wall Street
Journal.
PILOT
(to his co-pilot)
--Even taking into consideration the pay-off to the parents, a week with a girl in Burkina Faso is cheaper than a night with a girl in Jersey.
CO-PILOT
Plus, they're cleaner--
PILOT
--and a lot of them speak better English.
CO-PILOT
(shrug)
Personally, I prefer a language barrier--
An unmarked military jet appears through the starboard window.
The
voice on the radio is familiar.
VALENTINE (O.C.)
--Charlie, Echo, India. Descend for landing on heading zero... two... nine.
The Pilot picks up the radio, looks to Yuri. Yuri shakes his head,
dialling his satellite phone.	Yuri's call is answered.
YURI
(into phone, trying not to sound
too desperate)
Colonel Southern, it's Yuri. Sorry to call you on this number but I've got an Interpol jet and--
The jet outside the window falls back.
INT.	A PENTAGON OFFICE.	DAY.
A mid-rank office dominated by a computer terminal. We look over COLONEL SOUTHERN's shoulder. He is admiring a new medal. Two
other MEN
IN SUITS sit opposite.
COL. SOUTHERN
(into phone, measured voice)
I can't know you right now. It's not a good time.
Southern hangs up.
INT.	COCKPIT - ILYUSHIN-76 CARGO PLANE.	DAY.
YURI, hearing the response, explodes.
YURI
(gaping at the phone in disbelief)
Not a good time!
Suddenly machine gun fire strafes the Ilyushin - bullets tearing through the fuselage, perilously close to Yurirs very combustible cargo.
CO-PILOT
Motherfucker!
The jet appears again at the window.
VALENTINE
(radio)
--Charlie, Echo, India.	Comply immediately.
That was your last warning.
YURI
Where was the first fucking warning?!
VALENTINE
(radio)
Rock your wings if you intend to comply.
PILOT
(to Yuri, anxious)
I'm putting us down.
YURI
(incredulous)
You land and we're all going away! I don't have paperwork!
PILOT
(incredulous)
We're in a flying fucking bomb! They're firing bullets at our bullets! Forget about going away! They shoot again, we're going away for good! I'm putting us down.
YURI
(knowing he's right)
Okay!	Okay!--Fuck!!
The pilot responds on the radio.
PILOT
(into radio)
This is Charlie Echo India. Descending on heading zero two nine.
The Interpol jet takes the lead towards a small airport. Yuri surveys the
terrain below, getting his head back in the game.
YURI
(pointing out a narrow highway)
Not the airport.	There.	The highway.	It's
our only fucking hope.
PILOT
(concerned)
A pothole could set us off.
YURI
Don't underestimate yourself. You're the best, Tony.
The pilot doesn't buy it but reluctantly changes course anyway.
INT.	INTERPOL JET.	DAY.
From his own wingseat, VALENTINE observes the Ilyushin's detour, landing on the highway.
INTERPOL PILOT
I can't land there.
VALENTINE
(to the pilot)
He can't get far. I want a truck waiting on the tarmac.
EXT.	HIGHWAY.	DAY.
A heavily-trafficked highway. WOMEN carrying water jars on their heads, a thin COW pulling the carcass of a car, VENDORS selling
dry
meat, CHILDREN playing war games.
The pedestrians look up to see the lumbering Ilyushin making its final approach - they scatter.
The Ilyushin weaves on landing, hits a bone-jarring pothole.
INSIDE THE PLANE - boxes of grenades, bullets and other munitions jump dangerously up and down.
Finally, the Ilyushin pulls up safely on the highway, engines shutting down. YURI's head appears out of the cockpit window.
Curious LOCALS, recovered from the shock, are gathering at the
side
of the road.
YURI
(to the pilots, sizing up the
locals)
We're going to be okay.
The PILOTS are already halfway out of the plane door, grabbing supplies as they go.
YURI (cont'd)
(calling out from the window)
Where are you going?
PILOT
As far from the evidence as I can.
The pilots start running down the highway.
YURI
Wait, you idiots! There's not going to be any evidence! Stay with the plane!
The pilots ignore him - run for their lives.
YURI is left alone.	He turns a lever marked, "CARGO BAY".
EXT.	CARGO BAY.	DAY.
The rear cargo bay opens. YURI stands beside his incriminating merchandise.
YURI
(to the gathering locals)
Help yourselves.	Be my guest.	No charge.
One LOCAL MAN tentatively approaches the cargo bay.	Yuri hands
him
an AK-47 and a box of shells.
More SIERRA LEONESE LOCALS emerge from the side of the road, seemingly out of thin air.
Yuri hands out more guns.
YURI (cont'd)
(to other locals)
Take the whole crate.
Two men oblige, ferrying the crate away.
The other locals become bolder, then brazen.
Soon it's a free-far-all. Men, women and children swarm all over the plane pilfering the arms and anything else that isn't bolted down - also a lot that is.
Yuri has to exit the plane to avoid being trampled in the rush.
EXT.	HIGHWAY.	DAY.
YURI buys a Fanta from a vendor - exchanging it for a box of grenades.
He sits on a soda crate for a front row seat at the chaos.
Yuri has a calculator out - totalling his losses.
YURI
(muttering under his breath,
shutting off the calculator in
disgust)
What a fucking disaster.
Yuri sees the pilot seats being stolen.
YURI
Hey, not those!	You don't touch the plane!
(plaintive moan)
Not the fucking seats... 
Glancing up the highway, Yuri sees an approaching cloud of dust - VALENTINE and two truckfuls of heavily-armed Interpol Agents.
Too late.	The last of the guns and ammunition are being carted
away
on the back of a thin cow.
Valentine's truck fishtails to a halt beside the stripped plane.
Valentine is first off the trucks and into the plane's cargo bay
-
empty.
Other INTERPOL AGENTS fan out - futilely questioning locals.
Miraculously the weapons have vanished into the bush.
Valentine calls out to the last fleeing local - a BOY with a lifevest.
VALENTINE
Hey, you!
The boy stares back, defiantly inflates the life preserver.
VALENTINE (cont'd)
(exasperated)
Forget it.
The entire cargo has gone.	An errant bullet falls off a shelf in
the plane and rolls down the floor - Valentine picks it up.
YURI sits innocently on his soda crate.
A frustrated African Interpol Agent, MBIZI, wound-up by the chase,
rushes Yuri - slams him to the ground.
MBIZI
You run from us.
(flashing a machete in Yuri's
face)
Can you run with no legs?
Valentine rushes over, pulls Mbizi off Yuri.
VALENTINE
No, Mbizi.	No, no, no.
Valentine drags Mbizi out of Yuri's earshot. Mbizi still wants a piece of Yuri - Valentine preventing him getting to the
gunrunner.
MBIZI
Let me disappear him, Mr. Valentine. He is a devil. Let me disappear him.
VALENTINE
I can't do that.
MBIZI
Look where we are.	Who will know?
VALENTINE
We will.
Mbizi stops struggling against Valentine.
MBIZI
Turn your back, Mr. Valentine. I will go to hell to stop him.
VALENTINE
(gently)
No.
(to his Agents)
Find the pilots.
Mbizi and another Agent reluctantly head off in a truck.
Valentine returns to Yuri who is dusting himself off.	Valentine
handcuffs Yuri himself, picks up the soda crate and sits Yuri
back
on it.
VALENTINE (cont'd)
I've spent my whole career on the right side of the line. You're the first man I've encountered who makes me seriously consider crossing it.
YURI
What's the charge?
VALENTINE
What are you doing in Sierra Leone?
YURI
I'm on safari.
VALENTINE
(referring to the bullet)
Shooting wildebeests with submachine guns?
YURI
Are you with the park service? Hunting without a license - is that the charge?
VALENTINE
You're trafficking arms.
YURI
Trading.	But without evidence who can say?
VALENTINE
Trade or traffic, you make a fortune by keeping the poorest people on the planet killing each other.
(hesitates, unsure whether to
waste his breath - wastes it
anyway)
Do you know why I do what I do?
Yuri remains handcuffed, sitting on the soda crate - dwarfed by
the
cargo plane.	Valentine paces beside him.
VALENTINE (cont'd)
(ignoring him)
There are more prestigious assignments, you know. Keeping track of the nuclear arsenals. You would think it more critical to world security. It's not. Nine out of
ten war victims today are killed by assault rifles and other small arms - like yours. Those missiles just sit in their silos. Your AK-47 - it's the real weapon of mass destruction.
Yuri regards his interrogator curiously. Despite the sun beating down, he feels obliged to give him his version of the facts of
life.
YURI
I don't want people dead, Agent Valentine. I admit, a shooting war is better for business. But I'd prefer people to fire my guns and miss. Just as long as they're firing.
