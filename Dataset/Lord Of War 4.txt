He regards Valentine with something approaching pity.
YURI (cont'd)
I realize the unspeakable things that are done with my weapons. I also understand the unspeakable things that are done with Williams Sonoma carving knives and Wilson baseball bats and they aren't taking those off the market any time soon. People will always buy guns. Why not mine?
Valentine appears to have no answer.
YURI (cont'd)
Can I go? You've got nothing on me-- (unable to resist)
--but cuffs.
Now Valentine smiles.
VALENTINE
I am legally permitted to hold you for twenty-four hours without charging you.
Yuri looks away, knows where this is going.
VALENTINE (cont'd)
You may ask, why do I bother to do that? I can assure you, it is not because I enjoy your company. And you may be surprised to learn that it is not for any vindictive motive. No. The reason I delay you for every second of the permissible twenty-four hours, is that I am delaying your deadly trade and the deaths of your victims. I don't think of it as taking a
day from you but giving a day to them. Some innocent man, woman or child somewhere has one more day on this earth because you are not free.
Valentine looks to his watch.
VALENTINE (cont'd)
See you in twenty-three hours and fifty five minutes.
Valentine walks away.	Yuri is left to ponder the notion.
We see time lapse photography of Yuri waiting out his twenty-four hours, under armed guard on the highway - stretching his legs, eating a suspicious-looking sandwich, going to the bathroom, the
sun
arcing across the sky - all the while his plane is being cannibalized by the locals. Finally the time lapse slows back
into
real time.
Valentine returns in a Jeep with Mbizi and other Agents.
VALENTINE
You'll be pleased to know your colleagues were no more co-operative than you.
Valentine opens the back of the Jeep. Lying in the back, the bodies
of the two PILOTS shot and stripped.
VALENTINE (cont'd)
The locals got to them before we could.
Yuri turns away from the sight.	His handcuffs are removed.
Returning Yuri's documents, Valentine notices a photo of AVA and NICKI in the wallet.
VALENTINE (cont'd)
Handsome family.
Valentine and the Agents get back in the truck and drive away.
EXT.	HIGHWAY.	DUSK.
YURI starts to walk down the deserted highway alone - his cargo plane is now just another carcass in the jungle.
A CONVOY of armored personnel carriers barrels past him - the color:
U.N. white.	The lead car slams on its brakes, bringing the train
to
a stop. A woman pokes her head out of the window - CAPTAIN VIVIAN
CARLISLE.
VIVIAN
(pleasantly surprised)
Yuri!	Yuri Orlov!
YURI
(giving her an embarrassed hug)
Vivian... 
VIVIAN
What are you doing here?
YURI
(approaching the window)
You know.	Fighting the good fight.
VIVIAN
An aid program?
YURI
Uh, yes. In fact, I've just had some transport problems. You couldn't give me a ride to Monrovia, could you?
VIVIAN
Sure.	Climb in.
Yuri steps back into a vehicle with which he is very familiar.
VIVIAN (cant' d)
We're pulling out. It's too dangerous. It's a shame. We were really doing some good things.
Yuri nods in understanding.
INT.	HOTEL AFRICA - YURI'S HOTEL ROOM.	NIGHT.
A weary YURI enters his room.	Sitting on the green sofa - bound
and
gagged, face reduced to pulp, silver hair matted with blood - SIMEON.
YURI
Jesus!	Simeon!
ANDRE JNR., a FLUNKY and his CHEERLEADERS appear from behind the
door, laughing at his shocked reaction.
YURI (cont'd)
Andre!	What in heaven is he doing here?
ANDRE JNR.
A gift for you.
Yuri stares into the old gunrunner's terrified eyes.
ANDRE JNR. (cont'd)
You got here just in time. I was afraid he would die before you got a chance to kill him.
He offers Yuri a Beretta.
YURI
Me?!
ANDRE JNR.
Who do you think informed on you - cost you your plane? He came to meet my father, hoping to take your place.
Yuri spits on Simeon.
YURI
You stupid old fuck!
ANDRE JNR.
(knowing smile)
He killed your man when he tried to kill you.
Andre again offers Yuri the Beretta.
YURI
No.
ANDRE JNR.
(confused)
You want us to let him go?
YURI
No.	No.	I... 
Andre offers him the gun a third time.	Yuri refuses it.
ANDRE JNR.
So you do want him dead. You just don't want to kill him yourself? I understand.
Andre grabs Yuri and presses the gun into Yuri's palm, clasping
his
own hand over Yuri's.
ANDRE JNR.
We'll do it together.	A bonding experience.
Andre forces Yuri's finger onto the trigger as he aims at the terrified Simeon - eyes pleading.
Yuri attempts to pull his hand away but Andre is too strong.
ANDRE JNR.
You can stop if you want - but
you do.	Just say the word.
Andre stares at Yuri not Simeon.
ANDRE JNR. (cont'd)
Say, "stop".
Yuri opens his mouth but no word comes. Andre presses Yuri's finger
onto the trigger.
The gun goes off. A splash of blood across the sofa's green upholstery.
The gunshot echoes around the room.	Simeon is very dead.
YURI
(quietly)
Stop.
Andre smiles.
ANDRE JNR.
(surveying the blood-spattered
room)
I'll get you another room with a nicer view.
INT.	HOTEL AFRICA - LIBERIA.	DAY.
YURI collapses on the bar - gestures to the BARMAN who immediately
pours a line of cocaine in full view.
YURI hoovers it up.
YURI (V.O.)
I started doing a lot of cocaine in West
Africa. I wasn't medicating myself. I was simply playing catch-up. I was constantly dealing with people who are chemically imbalanced without the aid of chemicals. It's just a matter of etiquette. It's rude to act sane in a room full of lunatics.
The Barman nods to a patron at a corner table - a SEASONED FIGHTER
- no more than eighteen years old.
BARMAN
He bought you "brown-brown", Mr. Yuri.
YURI
(wiping his nose)
What?
BARMAN
"Brown-brown".
YURI
What is it?
BARMAN
(laughs)
A mixture - cocaine and gunpowder.
YURI
What does the gunpowder do?
BARMAN
It's magic. They give it to the small boys before battle - they do anything.
YURI
Some other time.
BARMAN
You have to try it at least once, Mr. Yuri.
The Barman starts chopping another line.
YURI
Why?
BARMAN
(laughing)
Because it's your gunpowder.
Sure enough the Barman pours the gunpowder from one of Yuri's
39mm
shells into the cocaine.
The SEASONED FIGHTER, assault rifle slung over his shoulder, intimidating air, sidles up to Yuri - stares him down. Yuri has
no
option, does a line.
He washes it down with a swig from a vodka bottle, raises his glass
to the fighter.
The Barman puts on a Ukrainian folk song.	Yuri picks out one of
the
PROSTITUTES in the bar, starts dancing.
He drunkenly dances with one PROSTITUTE after another - the dance almost violent, the prostitutes flung aside, none lasting more
than
a few seconds - caught in the arms of the other PATRONS.
To Yuri, the bar swims before his eyes.
The music stops.	Yuri, wild-eyed, looks at the stunned bar room.
YURI
(to no one in particular, whipping his vodka bottle off the bar)
I'm going for a walk.
EXT.	MONROVIA.	NIGHT.
A MONTAGE OF SCENES FROM YURI'S P.O.V. IN HIS ALTERED STATE. [A MIXTURE OF FORMATS INCLUDING SUPER-8 & VIDEO, SHAKY HANDHELD FOOTAGE, OVER-EXPOSED FOOTAGE, BLACK & WHITE FOOTAGE EDITED OUT-
OF-
SEQUENCE WITH JUMP CUTS AND FLASH FRAMES]
YURI staggers towards the edge of town - still swigging from his bottle.
A ROOM WITH A CURVED CEILING ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF MONROVIA
YURI, eyes unable to focus, stares at a WOMAN'S FACE in front of him, moving back and forth. The gyrating stops.
Yuri realizes he is lying in the mouth of an enormous cement pipe
on
his back, a prostitute on top of him. She gets to her feet, adjusting her dress.
Yuri panics, hurriedly zipping himself.
YURI
(a mixture of French and English)
I didn't fuck you, did I?	Did I fuck you?
PROSTITUTE
(in French, as she counts Yuri's
money)
It's not what I would call a fuck.
The prostitute tosses a couple of bills back to him. Yuri ignores
the money, staggers after her.
YURI
Are you sick?
She ignores him.
YURI (cont'd)
(screaming)
Are you sick?!
Yuri staggers to his feet - wanders aimlessly across a field.
A DANCE IN DUST SOMEWHERE ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF MONROVIA
Two dozen pairs of feet chase each other on a dirt field to cheers
from a crowd. The dust clears, revealing a bundle of cloth and string doubling as a soccer ball. The game is between two indistinguishable teams of MONROVIAN YOUNGSTERS on a makeshift
dirt
field, goalposts constructed from tree branches lashed together.
YURI wanders onto the field, joins the game without asking. The players humor him by letting him have the ball.
Yuri dribbles up field, takes an enormous swipe at the ball, misses
completely, clattering to the ground.
The crowd and players laugh. The game goes on. Yuri, also laughing
but in a far more desperate manner, picks himself up and wanders away.
A LIBERIAN BAR CALLED "ZANZI-BAR"
YURI throws up at the back of a saloon flimsily constructed from rusted corrugated iron.
Rinsing out his mouth with vodka, he is distracted by the sound
of
two little GIRLS arguing.
GIRL #1 (O.C.)
They will!
GIRL #2 (O.C.)
They won't!
GIRL #1 (O.C.)
They will!
GIRL #2 (O.C.)
They won't!
GIRL #1
They will!
GIRL #2
Ask the foreigner.	The foreigner will know.
The GIRLS approach Yuri - no older than seven, formal white dresses,
hands politely behind their backs.
YURI
Hello.
GIRL #1
Sir, will my fingers grow back?
One of the girls shows Yuri a healed stump where her hand should
be.
Yuri runs away.
A MODERN SCULPTURE SOMEWHERE IN MONROVIA
YURI passes in front of an abstract arrangement of holes that turns
out to be a building pock-marked with gunshells.
Suddenly a FACE appears in one of the holes - SIMEON. The gunshot
wound in his forehead still evident.	Yuri gasps.
YURI
Simeon.
Simeon turns and walks away - revealing a large exit wound in the
back
of his head.
YURI (cont'd)
Simeon!!
Yuri pokes his head through the hole but Simeon has vanished.
Yuri
turns back to find himself trapped by TWO MEN in flip-flops, shorts,
Gap T-shirts and AK-47's.
Through Yuri's eyes the two men look like four.	The two/four men
go
through Yuri's pockets, take his watch, shoes.
Yuri is oddly compliant - clumsily helping one of the thieves fasten
the watch.
One of the men, tired of Yuri's antics, aims his gun at Yuri's head.
His colleague stops him.
MAN #1
Don't.	He's Andre's.
MAN #2
(keeping his gun raised)
Fuck Andre.
YURI
(seemingly beyond caring)
Yeah, fuck Andre.
The man fires at Yuri. The gun jams. Yuri looks almost disappointed. The man tries again. Again the gun jams.
YURI
(referring to the gun)
I'm sorry. They don't usually do that. Let me have a look. Maybe I can fix it.
MAN #1
(disgusted)
Fuck off!
The man whips the gun across Yuri's face.
A PATH OUTSIDE MONROVIA
YURI, face streaked with blood and dirt, wanders aimlessly through
the brush outside Monrovia.
A HYENA appears on the dirt path in front of him - teeth bared, frenzied eyes.
Yuri stares at the wild dog - starts to quietly cry. Tears roll down his cheeks.
The hyena runs away.	Yuri is alone.
DISSOLVE
TO:
EXT.	MONROVIAN DOCKS.	DAWN.
A vacant-eyed YURI sits in the shadow of an enormous stack of arms,
unloaded from a freighter.
A presidential motorcade appears on the dock. ANDRE BAPTISTE emerges out of his Mercedes Jeep, gun in his hand. He strides up
to
Yuri.
ANDRE BAPTISTE
Yuri, you fucked up! I am going to shoot your face off with your own gun.
Yuri doesn't flinch.
YURI
(unfazed, regarding the man)
Not bad.	Andre's latest double?
The man's face falls. The real ANDRE BAPTISTE emerges from the car with
ANDRE JNR.
ANDRE BAPTISTE
(to Yuri, standing beside his
uncanny double)
How did you know?
YURI
He's too eloquent.
ANDRE BAPTISTE
You have no heart.
Baptiste brandishes a copy of the New York Times.
ANDRE BAPTISTE
Have you seen the news? They accuse me of rigging elections, but after this in your Florida with your Supreme Court of kangaroos--
CLOSE ON the headline, "U.S. SUPREME COURT REVERSES RECOUNT RULING".
ANDRE BAPTISTE (cont'd) --now the U.S. must shut up forever.
Yuri just smiles.
YURI
More good news. That's the last aid shipment. The war is so bad, the U.N. is pulling out.
Andre shrugs.	He regards the inactivity at the dock.
ANDRE BAPTISTE
Why is nothing happening?
ANDRE, JNR.
(reluctant to give his father bad
news)
No trucks. They are trapped on the front lines.
YURI
There are trucks. You just have to get all that food out of them.
Yuri gestures down the dock where food is being loaded into trucks
marked, "HUMANITARIAN AID"
Andre Baptiste and Andre Jnr.	are clearly taken with the idea.
ANDRE JNR.
Killing certain humans can be considered humanitarian.
(thinly disguised reference to the
previous night)
Isn't that right, Mr. Yuri?
Andre Baptiste hands Yuri his payment - a slim briefcase containing
a pouch of uncut diamonds.
YURI (V.O.)
After surviving the last few days I'd started
to feel like I was invincible. But there was a weapon that could hurt me.
INT.	UPPER EAST SIDE APARTMENT.	DAY.
From behind the cover of a sofa NICOLAI shoots at an unseen foe,
his
finger as the gun.
The camera pans around the room to find AVA in an armchair opposite
AGENT VALENTINE.
AVA
Hush, Nicki.
(to Valentine)
I don't believe you.
Valentine is unfazed.
AVA (cont'd)
Can you prove any of it? Where is your evidence?
VALENTINE
I was hoping you could help us with that.
(opens an old file containing a
copy of a newspaper clipping,
headlined, "Cordova
Disappearance" )
I understand your parents died tragically in EI Salvador.
(meeting Avars gaze)
That regime has startling similarities to several of the regimes supplied by your husband.
AVA
Get out.
Valentine rises to leave.	Ava holds Nicolai, her mind reeling.
INT.	FASHION SHOW - NEW YORK.	NIGHT.
Impossibly thin MODELS strut along a transparent lightbox of a runway, flanked by SOCIALITES and PAPARAZZI.
Projected on the wall behind them, the words, "FASHION AGAINST
HATE
-	Dress Not To Kill" and various images from the world's warzones.
Each outfit is enthusiastically applauded.
MASTER OF CEREMONIES
And now, one of the sponsors of tonight's evening, former Miss World, Ava Cordova.
AVA appears from behind the wings in a designer gown. She modestly
accepts the applause - gradually becomes aware of a projection on her face.
She turns to see the projected image of a CHILD holding an AK-47.
When she turns back, tears are rolling down her face.
INT.	NEW YORK HOUSE.	NIGHT.
Back to us, AVA naked, sits on the end of her bed, clothes laid
out
beside her.
YURI (O.C.)
Ava?
YURI, still carrying his suitcase, appears in the doorway. He drops
the case.
YURI
Ava, what's wrong?	Where's Nicki?
AVA
(still with her back to us)
He's with your parents.
Yuri senses something very wrong.
YURI
Why aren't you dressed? I thought we were going out.
He finds a robe from the closet - gently places it around her.
She
pulls it off her shoulders.
AVA
(turning back to look at him)
I can't wear the clothes. I can't wear the jewelry. I can't drive the car. I can't live in this house. Everything1s got blood on it.
Yuri pulls the robe back onto her shoulders, walks to the window.
YURI
Don't be so melodramatic.
Ava pulls the robe to her, follows Yuri to the window.
AVA
Of course I'm melodramatic. I'm a failed actress, remember? We need to talk about it.
YURI
Why?	We never have before.
AVA
Now we do.
Yuri notices the Interpol business card on the bedside table.
YURI
These people - you can't trust them--
AVA
--I've talked to your parents. Why do you think they don't want your money? They know where it comes from. We all know.
Yuri sighs, resigned.
YURI
I sell people a means to defend themselves, Ava. That's all. I don't hold a gun to any one's head and make them shoot--
AVA
--Yuri, I see the news.	Sierra Leone--
YURI
--I don't sell machetes.
AVA
--What do you think is pointing at the victims when they use those machetes? I see the pictures. Yuri, the guns are bigger than the boys.
YURI
(angered)
There's nothing illegal about what I do.
AVA
I don't care if it's legal, it's wrong.
Ava meets his eye.
AVA (cont' d)
I can accept the drugs. I can even accept the other women. I can't accept this.
Yuri looks away.
AVA
Please stop.
YURI
(looks back)
It makes no difference if I stop. Someone will take my place the next day.
AVA
Let them. We have enough. You're not that little boy in Odessa anymore, lining up for a loaf of bread--
YURI
--It's not about the money.
AVA
What is it?
He doesn't answer - perhaps he doesn't have one.	Ava looks out
of
the window at their expensive view.
AVA (cont'd)
I feel like all I've done my whole life is be pretty. All I've done is be born. I'm not just a failed actress. I'm also a failed writer, failed artist, failed businesswoman. I'm not much good as a mother. Come to think of it, I'm not even that pretty any more. I've failed at everything, Yuri.
(turning back to him)
But I won't fail as a human being. I'm leaving.
The words finally register with Yuri.
YURI
You can't leave.	I'll stop.
(as if trying to convince himself)
I'll stop.
Ava is skeptical.	He holds her, reassures her.
YURI (cont'd)
I've been thinking about it for a while. A lot, lately.
(as if trying to convince himself) I'm making more from the oil and timber anyhow.
(further reassurance)
I'll stop.
She interrogates his eyes for the truth.
AVA
(pleading eyes)
You will?	You promise?
YURI
(deadly serious)
Yes.
(changing the subject a
millisecond too fast)
Now get dressed.	We'll go out.
Ava picks up the dress off the bed.
Yuri gazes at her.
YURI (cont'd)
By the way, you're wrong about not being pretty any more.
She turns back and smiles.
EXT.	FIFTH AVENUE AT CENTRAL PARK EAST.	DAY.
A YOUNG INTERPOL AGENT, carrying a tray of coffee, approaches a plain panel van parked outside Yuri's apartment building.
YURI (V.O.)
For the next month I stopped running guns.
I went legitimate.
The van door opens to reveal VALENTINE and other INTERPOL AGENTS, wearing headsets, monitoring a scanner device. The agents read porn to keep themselves amused - except Valentine.
YURI (V.O.)
No wonder Valentine was confused.
INT.	UPPER EAST SIDE APARTMENT.	DUSK.
YURI toys with his old BULLET pendant as he talks on the phone.
For once the spreadsheets in front of him deal with oil and timber.
YURI (V.O.)
Thank God there are still legal ways to exploit developing countries.
With the cordless phone to his ear, Yuri wanders to the kitchen.
He
tosses the pendant down a trash chute.
Back in the den, Yuri punches a calculator as he continues his phone
call.
YURI (V.O.)
But the only problem with an honest buck is they're so hard to make. The margins are too low. Too many people are doing it.
Finally we are privy to the conversation.
YURI
(into phone)
--Impossible. Two and a quarter? I can't make a profit at two and a quarter. Why don't you take my oil and I'll fucking pay you?
Yuri hangs up, stares down from his apartment window.
Valentine's panel truck drives away.
LATER
Night has fallen over Central Park - criss-crossed by a necklace
of
lights.	Yuri continues to stare out of the window.
He is perplexed by the sight of a diplomatic motorcade parked in front of
his building.
Before he can make sense of it, the house phone rings.
AVA enters.
AVA
(confused)
Yuri, the President of Liberia is in the
lobby.
Yuri, stunned for a millisecond, recovers with a smile.
YURI
(glance to his watch)
He's early.
INT.	LOBBY - UPPER EAST SIDE APARTMENT.	DAY.
ANDRE BAPTISTE is admiring his new uniform in a gilt edged mirror.
ANDRE JNR. is flirting with two TEENAGE GIRLS - residents of the building. The perplexed DOORMAN stares at the motorcade outside
his
door - flashing lights on the police escort.
ANDRE JNR.
(to the girls)
--You should come to Liberia with me tomorrow. It is beautiful this time of year.
TEENAGE GIRL
Liberia.	Is that on Long Island?
YURI, ashen-faced, hurriedly exits the elevator into the ornate lobby - strides up to Andre Snr.
ANDRE JNR.
Yuri!
YURI
(nervous as hell)
What the fuck are you doing here, Andre?
ANDRE BAPTISTE
(hugging Yuri)
We're here for the peace talks at the U.N.
YURI
(pulling him out of earshot of the
curious Doorman, anxious whisper) So at the same time you thought you'd drop in on your arms dealer?!
ANDRE BAPTISTE
Is that what you still are? You're a hard man to get hold of all of a sudden.
YURI
I--
ANDRE BAPTISTE
--But now you mention it, we are doing a little shopping while we're here - that is if you open for business.
YURI
(anxious look past Andre to the motorcade on the street)
They've got to be watching.
ANDRE BAPTISTE
(disdainful shrug)
Of course they blame me. They always blame me. They are on a--
YURI
(unable to resist)
--hunt for a witch?
ANDRE BAPTISTE
(a smile, for once correcting
Yuri)
"Witch-hunt".	But I have been granted
diplomatic immunity due to the escalation
in hostilities.
(conspiratorial)
That is why I need you. They are making life difficult to re-supply. It will require a man of your unusual ingenuity.
YURI
I can't help you.	I'm sorry.
ANDRE BAPTISTE
(nods)
I understand.
He shakes Yuri's hand firmly.
ANDRE BAPTISTE (cont'd) But you should know that our present difficulties compel us to be unusually generous.
Yuri realizes that Andre has placed a huge uncut diamond in his hand.
ANDRE BAPTISTE (cont'd)
(hugging Yuri)
Farewell, Lord of War.
ANDRE JNR.
You still haven't brought me the gun of
Rambo.
Andre Baptiste and his son breeze out of the lobby.
INT.	UPPER EAST SIDE APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM.	NIGHT.
YURI enters, sits in an armchair. AVA and NICOLAI are cuddled on the sofa - Ava reading him a fairytale.
AVA
(looking up from the book)
Was that about the oil or the timber?
YURI
Both.	Everything.
Ava smiles, carries on reading.
Yuri looks to his hand - we rack focus to the uncut diamond.
Yuri
gets up.
INT.	UPPER EAST SIDE APARTMENT - GARBAGE ROOM.	NIGHT.
YURI, still in his suit, stands in a dumpster, searching.
YURI (V.O.)
At four and a half months a human fetus has a reptile's tail - a remnant of our evolution.
Amongst a pile of rotten food he finds his necklace containing
the
BULLET.
YURI (V.O.)
You can fight a lot of enemies and survive but if you fight your biology you always lose.
Yuri places the bullet around his neck.
INT.	NEW YORK APARTMENT.	MORNING.
AVA is fastening eight-year-old NICOLAI's coat, readying to go
out.
YURI, half-dressed, appears in the hallway.
YURI
Hey, not even waiting to say goodbye? I'm leaving in ten minutes.
AVA
Sorry, Nicki has swim practice.
Nicolai kisses his father.
NICOLAI
Bye, Papa.
YURI
(hugging him)
See you, big guy.
Ava kisses Yuri.
AVA
(teasing him)
Personally, I'm glad you're going. You've been here so long you're starting to get on my nerves.
YURI
(taking the teasing good-
naturedly)
This oil concession should be wrapped up by Thursday. I'll be back for the weekend. We'll go somewhere - the sea.
AVA
That would be fun.
A thought occurs to Yuri.
YURI
You trust me, right?
Yuri's turn to interrogate her eyes.	Ava smiles.
YURI (V.O.)
She looked me directly in the eye the way I've looked in the eyes of a thousand customs officials, government bureaucrats and footsoldiers from every law enforcement agency in the world - and she lied without flinching.
AVA
Yes, I trust you.
YURI (V.O.)
She'd learned from the best.
Ava gives Yuri a final kiss, hurries Nicolai out the door.
INT.	MERCEDES SEDAN.	DAY.
From the rear seat of a Mercedes sedan we observe YURI exiting
the
apartment building and entering a waiting Mercedes sedan of his
own.
AVA (O.C.)
(to the DRIVER)
That's him.
We reveal AVA and NICOLAI in the car. Yuri's car pulls away and Ava's car follows.
NICOLAI
(confused)
Where are we going, Mama?
AVA
It's a game.
NICOLAI
Like hide and seek?
AVA
Yes.
EXT.	PUBLIC STORAGE FACILITY.	DAY.
YURI locks his storage locker, observable from the street, and exits
the facility carrying a passport and briefcase.
YURI (V.O.)
I can always sense when I'm being tailed. I know what to look for. But then I'd never been tailed by the woman I love.
Returning to his car, Yuri fails to notice that AVA has witnessed his routine from her own car.
Instead of following the car, Ava exits with Nicolai.
INT.	PUBLIC STORAGE FACILITY.	DAY.
AVA, NICOLAI in tow, approaches Yuri's locker.
She tries a combination - fails.	Tries another - fails.	A third
-
same result.
YURI (V.O.)
I can put myself in Ava's place. She might have understood if the combination was the last four digits of my social, my birthdate, even her birthdate but not Nicolai's.
Ava looks to Nicolai, tries one more combination, reluctantly.
CLOSE ON the numerals on the lock - "10... 6... "
YURI (V.O.)
My son's birthday unlocked what the government would later describe as, "a catalogue of carnage".
"90".	The lock opens.
AVA
(whisper, to herself)
Not that.	Not that, Yuri.
Ava opens the storage room door - at first struck by the exhibition
of her paintings inside the locker. Shaking the image from her head, she turns her attention to the briefcases and other
documents.
She shuffles through the passports in horror - different photos
of
Yuri, different names: "George Eagleman", "Georges D'Aigle", etc.
Who
is her husband?	Is he any of them?
INT.	"THE CRIMEAN" RESTAURANT - DAY.
VITALY is back at work in the kitchen of the family restaurant.
YURI approaches - Vitaly senses something amiss.
VITALY
Come to see how the other half lives?
YURI
I miss your borscht. Mom and Dad say you're clean.
VITALY
You too.	They said you went legitimate -
hard to believe.
YURI
That's because it's not true.
Vitaly is hardly surprised.
Yuri glances to his parents, ANATOLY and IRINA, at the restaurant counter, folding napkins - observing their two sons.
They avert their eyes.
YURI
Only you know. I'm leaving tonight - on a job. I want you to come.
VITALY
I can't. I'm thinking of opening my own place.
YURI
Maybe this trip will help.	It's good money.
VITALY
(looking to his parents)
I've given my word.
YURI
They don't have to know. We'll tell them we're going for a little "r" and "r".
VITALY
Why do you need me all of a sudden?
YURI
West Africa's fucked-up.
(off Vitaly's look)
More than usual. I can't trust anybody. I need someone to watch my back.
The notion touches Vitaly.	Yuri closes the deal.
YURI (cant'd)
"Brothers in arms".
Vitaly looks to his PARENTS.	They stare at him until he averts
his
eyes.
Vitaly can't refuse his brother.
EXT.	HIGHWAY - SIERRA LEONE.	DAY.
A fork in the road. Two large trucks slog through the bush - take the left fork.
Sierra Leone -
2000
YURI, VITALY and ANDRE JNR. are in the cab of the truck, beside
the
DRIVER.
Andre is admiring his new M60 machine gun with attachable grenade launcher - the gun of Rambo.
YURI
(concerned by the route)
Where are we going?
ANDRE JNR.
RUF - "freedom fighters".
Yuri stares out of the window.
YURI (V.O.)
Every faction in Africa calls themselves by these noble names - "liberation-this", "patriotic-that", "democratic-republic-of-something or other". I guess they can't own up to what they usually are - "federation-of-worse-oppressors-than-the last-bunch-of-oppressors". Often the most barbaric atrocities occur when both combatants proclaim themselves "freedom fighters".
The truck passes a checkpoint marked by two skulls.
EXT.	REFUGEE CAMP - SIERRA LEONE.	DAY.
A tent city. A Jeep packed with young, machete-wielding FREEDOM FIGHTERS circles the refugee camp, taunting and terrorizing the inhabitants.
The mostly WOMEN and CHILDREN are trapped by the circling Jeep. Whenever a refugee attempts to escape, they are driven back by
the
increasingly manic, shrieking rebels.
Yuri's two trucks are parked on the roadway above the camp where the rest
of the REBELS are massed - a rag-tag mob wearing over-sized sneakers,
carrying machetes and the occasional AK-47.
At a small folding table a REBEL LEADER negotiates with YURI and ANDRE JNR. The Leader places a pile of uncut diamonds on the
table.
VITALY is more interested in the camp - observing the circling
Jeep
full of Rebels and their smirking comrades on the highway.
From a distance, he spies a WOMAN and YOUNG SON make a desperate
bid
for escape from the camp. Two REBELS, on foot, give chase. The woman appears to be pregnant.
Vitaly watches in horror. The Woman is quickly overtaken and hacked
to death.	Then the Boy.	Vitaly can't look, turns away.
VITALY
Jesus.
Vitaly comes to a horrific realization.
He hurries to Yuri, still negotiating with the Rebel Leader.
VITALY
Yuri, I need to talk to you.
YURI
Not now.
VITALY
(insistent)
Now.
YURI
(to the Rebel Leader)
Excuse me.
Vitaly draws Yuri out of earshot.
YURI
(irritated by the interruption)
What?
VITALY
(anxious whisper)
We can't do this deal.
YURI
(incredulous)
The fuck we can't.
VITALY
(referring to the camp)
Look over there. As soon as we leave, they're going to die.
YURI
(averting his eyes from the camp)
It's not our business.
VITALY
(protesting)
They killed a boy just now - as young as Nicki.
Yuri flinches.
The suspicious Rebel Leader and Andre Jnr. approach the two brothers.
REBEL LEADER
What's the hold up?
YURI
(trying to keep his poise)
There is no hold up.	I'll be right there.
Yuri draws Vitaly further away.
YURI (cont'd)
Vitaly, it's what we always know - we can't control what they do.
VITALY
Today we can. They're right there - close enough to touch.
YURI
(angry, impatient)
What do you think they'll do if we back out - they'll kill us.
VITALY
And if we go ahead - they'll kill them.
The Rebel Leader approaches again - this time he's not leaving.
REBEL LEADER
What is he saying?
YURI
Nothing.
Vitaly realizes the futility of the discussion, backs down.
VITALY
(resigned)
Nothing.	You're right, Yuri.	You're right.
(getting his head back in the
game)
Did I hear you say 300 IPG's, 500 assault rifles and 800 grenades? I thought it was 1,200 grenades. I'd better check.
Yuri pats his brother on the back, returns to the negotiating table.
Vitaly heads for the trucks.
For once we follow Vitaly.	Andre Jnr. regards Vitaly warily.
INT.	TRUCK.	DAY.
The prongs of a hammer on a box of grenades.	VITALY is prying
open
the lid.
Andre Jnr. appears behind him - M60 poised ominously on his hip.
ANDRE JNR.
What are you doing?
VITALY
Something for Yuri.
ANDRE JNR.
Step away - slowly.
Vitaly closes the lid - a ruse.	He picks up the hammer and in
one
sudden, violent motion swings it across Andre's face, smashing
his
jaw, teeth flying, Andre's body flopping like a rag doll.
Vitaly grabs two grenades from the box, pulls the pin from one
and
bowls it into the truck.
He runs.
The truck explodes in a fireball - instantly incinerating Andre
Jnr.
Yuri's head whips around.	The Rebel Leader's head whips around.
YURI
Vit!!
Vitaly dashes for the second truck.
The REBEL LEADER opens fire, raking Vitaly with machine-gun fire
-
still trying to run with legs torn to shreds.
YURI (cont'd)
No!!
A second hail of gunfire - all REBELS firing. Vitaly's legs betray
him.	He collapses to the ground in a pile of blood and dust.
We focus on Vitaly's still FACE - he has taken enough bullets to kill him three times over. But he is not quite dead.
Agonizingly slow, he raises the grenade hand to his mouth - pulls the pin with his teeth.
CLOSE on Vitaly's HAND, trying to summon the strength to throw
the
grenade.
A hand appears, grasps Vitaly's hand - gently but firmly removing the grenade.
YURI.
The Rebels keep their guns trained on Yuri, unsure where his loyalties lie. Yuri holds the fate of the camp in his hands - he could still toss the grenade, destroy the second truck, sacrifice his life.
Yuri stares to his brother and then to the grenade in his hand.
He
reaches down and delicately takes the pin from between Vitaly's lips.
The eyes of the brothers meet for the last time.	Yuri inserts
the
pin into the grenade, disarming it - the life goes from Vitaly's eyes forever.
Yuri removes any last doubt by tossing the disarmed grenade to
the
Rebel Leader.
Yuri walks away from Vitaly's dead body and returns to the negotiating table - Yuri now the living dead. The Rebel Leader
looks to the two trucks - one burning, one not.	He removes half
of
the diamonds from the table.
EXT.	TRUCK.	DAY.
YURI sits in the cab, staring out of the window as the truck drives
away.
YURI (V.O.)
Vitaly broke the cardinal rule of gunrunning. Never pick up a gun and join the customers.
The truck turns the bend. In the background, true to Vitaly's prediction, the rebels descend on the tent village, firing indiscriminately with their new weapons.
Yuri hears the sound - we detect a barely perceptible flinch.
INT.	REAR OF TRUCK.	DAY.
A lone gun crate, emptied of its contents has been put to use as VITALY's makeshift coffin.
YURI (V.O.)
Coffins are hard to come by in Sierra Leone. Demand is so high. Fortunately, we had a lot of boxes just the right size.
EXT.	SIERRA LEONE MARKET.	DAY.
"America's Funniest Home Videos" plays on a TV set. The canned laughter appears to be almost directed at YURI who is making a
long-
distance call on a geriatric telephone.
We aren't privy to the conversation.
YURI (V.O.)
I don't know which is worse, Jewish guilt or Catholic guilt. My parents were like God's tag-team.
We pull back to reveal the makeshift coffin sitting at Yuri's feet.
YURI (V.O.)
But I could not deny them the chance to say goodbye to their eldest son.
INT.	J.F.K. AIRPORT - CUSTOMS BAY.	DAY.
CLOSE ON the screen of an X-RAY machine. Innocuous oversize cargo
passes in front of the screen - a surfboard, a double bass, then
the
crate containing VITALY's body.
YURI (V.O.)
For twenty Monrovian dollars a doctor removed the lead from Vitaly's body and wrote a bogus death certificate. I should have paid more.
The OPERATOR of the machine, stops the conveyor belt.
YURI (V.O.)
I've smuggled millions of rounds of ammunition and the bullet that lands me in jail is found under my dead brother's rib.
In Vitaly's chest, a bullet.
INT.	J.F.K. AIRPORT - CONVEYOR BELT.	DAY.
The other oversize items move down the conveyor belt for collection
- YURI waits with two burly PORTERS.
No other items are appearing - finally the coffin containing VITALY.
Two ATF AGENTS appear behind Yuri.
AGENT
(flashing some ID)
Yuri Orlov, we're with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
YURI
(resigned smile, regarding the
insignia on their jackets)
Believe it or not, I only use the first two.
The agents are not amused - handcuff Yuri.
AGENT
You have the right to remain silent. Use it.
They march him away.
INT.	NEW YORK APARTMENT.	DAY.
A phone rings.
AVA, out in the hallway, surrounded by suitcases, looks to the phone, senses the identity of the caller.
She hustles NICOLAI out of the door, closes it behind her. The phone continues to ring.
INT.	MANHATTAN CENTRAL JAIL.	DAY.
YURI, on a payphone, in the jailhouse corridor, reluctantly hangs up. He makes another call.
INT.	"THE CRIMEAN" RESTAURANT - BRIGHTON BEACH.	DAY.
ANATOLY, lighting a candle, picks up the phone.
ANATOLY
"Crimean Restaurant".
YURI (O.C.)
Papa?
Anatoly looks at the telephone receiver in his hand - without another word he passes the phone to IRINA. ANATOLY walks away.
IRINA
(into phone)
Both my sons are dead.
INT.	INTERVIEW ROOM.	DAY.
CLOSE ON a SLUG in an evidence bag tossed onto a table - by VALENTINE. The
Agent can scarcely contain his excitement.
YURI sits at the small table, stares at the slug.
VALENTINE
One of yours?
Yuri doesn't take the bait.
Two other AGENTS sit at the back of the room observe the interrogation.
VALENTINE (cont'd)
(referring to a document) Curiously, the death certificate says he died of heart failure.
YURI
(shrug)
Maybe he did.
(referring to the slug)
If I saw one of those coming at me, l'd have heart failure.
The flippant comment gets under Valentine's skin but he keeps his temper in check.
VALENTINE
We performed the autopsy and released your brother's body to your family. You tried to do something decent, Yuri. You went against your nature. And now it's cost you.
(unable to resist)
Your brother's funeral is looking a lot like your funeral.
YURI
Falsifying a death certificate? That's not going to hold me.
VALENTINE
You're right, as usual.
Yuri not so cocky now - waits to see where this is going.
VALENTINE (cont'd)
(putting a copy of the New York
Times in front of Yuri)
Have you seen today's paper?
A front photograph of VALENTINE posing beside Yuri's documents including
his five BRIEFCASES. The headline reads, "MERCHANT OF DEATH IN CUSTODY".
Caption - "Catalogue of carnage."
VALENTINE (cont'd)
(pacing, lauding it over Yuri) Fake end-user certificates, cut-out companies, all meticulously catalogued. There's hardly a dictator, warlord or despot anywhere in the world you aren't on first name terms with.
(producing another evidence bag
containing Ava's diamond earrings
and an engagement ring)
Your trophy wife gave us the prize. She also provided us with these - which we suspect are conflict diamonds.
Yuri takes all this in.
VALENTINE (cont'd)
She has agreed to testify against you.
Yuri nods - picks up the newspaper. But instead of reading about his own front page news, he opens the paper, turns to World
Affairs
- various items on the warzones at the end of the millennium.
Yuri reads, takes his time. Valentine cannot believe his audacity.
Finally Yuri reacts.	A broad smile - his killer smile.
YURI
Enjoy it.
VALENTINE
(confused)
What?
YURI
This. Tell me that I am everything you despise, that I am the personification of evil, that I'm responsible for the breakdown of the social fabric of society and world order, that I am a one man genocide. Say everything you want to say to me now - because you don't have long.
Valentine is infuriated by Yuri's casual demeanor.
VALENTINE
Are you not paying attention or are you delusional? You've broken every arms embargo written. There's enough in those briefcases to buy you consecutive life sentences. You'll spend ten years going from a cell to a courtroom before you even start doing your time.
Yuri is looking away, apparently completely unconcerned. His attitude further angers Valentine.
VALENTINE (cont'd)
You don't seem to fully appreciate the seriousness of your situation!
YURI
(snapping back - his emotion
finally showing)
My family has disowned me. My wife and son have left me. My brother is dead. Trust me, I fully appreciate the seriousness of my situation. But I promise you I won't spend a single second in a courtroom.
Valentine laughs derisively.
VALENTINE
You are delusional.
Yuri is still unfazed.	He leans forward to close the deal.
YURI
I like you, Jack. Well, maybe not. But I understand you. You feel your loyalty to your badge has finally been rewarded. But you haven't counted on the people who gave you that badge.
Valentine's turn to hesitate.
YURI (cont'd)
(meeting Valentine's gaze)
Let me tell you what's going to happen so you can prepare yourself.
Yuri nods to the interview room door.
YURI (cont'd)
Soon there's going to be a knock on that door and you're going to be called outside.
A montage of scenes - Yuri's prediction plays out accompanied by
his
commentary.
INT.	INTERVIEW ROOM.	DAY.
A knock at the door and an AGENT nods to VALENTINE.
YURI (O.C.)
In the hall there will be a man who
outranks you.
INT.	HALLWAY - JAIL.	DAY.
Sure enough, a decorated military OFFICER talks to VALENTINE in
the
hallway as Yuri describes.
YURI (O.C.)
First, he will compliment you on the fine job you've done, how you're making the world a safer place and then he is going to tell you that I am to be released.
We observe valentine's reaction - vigorously arguing with his superior.
YURI (O.C.)
You are going to protest, you will probably threaten to resign.
The Officer, still turned away from us, tries to calm Valentine.
INT.	HALLWAY - JAIL.	DAY.
The door to the interview room opens.
YURI (O.C.)
But in the end I will be released.
Yuri exits the cell to freedom.
We return to the present.
INT.	INTERVIEW ROOM.	DAY.
VALENTINE's eyes burn into YURI.
YURI
(glancing to the open newspaper) The reason I'll be released is the same reason you think I will be convicted. I do rub shoulders with the most vile, sadistic men calling themselves leaders today.
(referring to the newspaper)
But some of those men are the enemies of your enemies.
Valentine is starting to get a sick feeling.
YURI (cont'd)
And while the biggest arms dealer in the world is your boss, the President of the United States - who ships more merchandise in a day than I do in a year - sometimes it's embarrassing to have his fingerprints on the guns. Sometimes he needs a freelancer like me to supply opposition forces he can't be seen supplying. You call me evil, but, unfortunately for you, I am a necessary evil.
There is a long silence.	Then,
A KNOCK AT THE DOOR.
Valentine and Yuri exchange a look. Valentine rises from the desk.
VALENTINE
I would tell you to go to hell. But I think you're already there.
Valentine turns on his heel. He is at the door when Yuri finally replies.
YURI
What if I'm not? What if I sleep fine at night? What if I sleep better than you? I think that's what truly scares you.
Valentine doesn't look back, exits.	Sure enough, the Officer is
in
the hall as Yuri predicted - COLONEL SOUTHERN.
EXT.	MANHATTAN JAIL - REAR EXIT.	DAY.
A car trunk closes on Yuri's five briefcases and other documents.
YURI is escorted out the rear entrance of the city jail to the nondescript
sedan by COLONEL SOUTHERN. As he's ushered into the car, Southern hands
Yuri yet another briefcase.
COLONEL SOUTHERN ushers Yuri into the car, hands him yet another briefcase
as the car door closes.
INT.	NONDESCRIPT SEDAN.	DAY.
YURI rides alone with the briefcase on his lap.
YURI (V.O.)
Most people are happy just to get out of jail. I expect to be paid to leave.
Yuri opens the case - BALES OF CASH.
YURI (V.O.)
I'm not a fool. I know that just because they need me one day doesn't mean they won't make me a scapegoat the next. But I was back doing
what I do best.
EXT.	MANHATTAN.	DAY.
The nondescript sedan melts into rush-hour traffic.
EXT.	SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE EAST - DESERT CHECKPOINT.	DAY.
A checkpoint in the desert - the fence a literal line in the sand.
YURI accompanies a convoy of trucks. He is joking with a BORDER OFFICER - back to doing what he loves.
The Border Officer inspects the crates in a truck, reads the manifest marked, "UMBRELLAS - QTY: 4,040 units".
BORDER OFFICER
(skeptical)
Umbrellas - to Saudi Arabia?
YURI
Sun umbrellas.
Yuri hands the Officer a plain, brown paper bag. The Officer looks inside
- a wad of cash.
BORDER OFFICER
Have a safe trip.
The Officer waves the convoy through.
EXT.	DESERT - BATTLEFIELD.	DAY.
The desert where we first found YURI, the aftermath of a battle.
He
speaks directly to camera once again.
YURI
For someone who's never fired a gun or been in a battle, I have suffered many casualties in my life. I guess that's how I survived. I never went to war... 
His thought is interrupted by a burst of gunfire.
YURI (cont'd)
... especially with myself.
Yuri walks away through the charred munitions and black smoke.
In the distance the sound of sporadic gunfire.
FADE TO BLACK
