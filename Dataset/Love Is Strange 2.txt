INT. ELLIOT AND KATE’S APT, BEDROOM - NIGHT

The door opens, and Elliot comes in.

(CONTINUED)
 
32.

CONTINUED:

He is coming from work, with a messenger bag and some envelopes in hand. He sees Kate in bed, asleep in an awkward position with a book on top of the covers and the reading light on. He comes to pick up the book, places it on the bedside table and turns the light off.

Kate opens her eyes, awake, and sees Elliot going into the bathroom.


INT. ELLIOT AND KATE’S APT, BATHROOM - NIGHT

Elliot is washing his hands in the bathroom sink. He looks at himself in the mirror for just a brief moment, and seems disappointed at his own image. He looks down at his hands again, and washes them thoroughly, letting water run through them.


INT. ELLIOT AND KATE’S APT, BEDROOM - NIGHT

Elliot comes from the bathroom wearing boxer shorts and an old T-shirt. He finds Kate reading the book in bed, pencil in hand.

KATE
How was it?

ELLIOT
Good.

KATE
And Jeremy?

He gets into bed, gives his wife a kiss on her cheek and turns the other way to lie down under the covers.

ELLIOT
Better than we could’ve ever

expected.

KATE
See, I told you.

ELLIOT
I know.

KATE
I called to see if you were coming to dinner.

ELLIOT
You did?
 



(CONTINUED)
 
33.

CONTINUED:

KATE
Left a message.

ELLIOT
I didn’t even have a moment to

check my messages.

KATE
That busy?

ELLIOT
Yeah, but we got it all in the

can.

KATE
That’s great.

ELLIOT
I’m exhausted.

Elliot is trying to fall asleep, while Kate keeps reading next to him. He turns around, ends up facing her but talks with his eyes closed, afraid the light would disturb his sleepiness.

ELLIOT
Sleep baby.

Kate doesn’t respond.

ELLIOT (CONT’D)
Sleep.

Kate underlines a passage on the book. Elliot finally opens his eyes, looks at her.

ELLIOT (CONT’D)
What’s going on, Kate?

KATE
Unlike you, I didn’t have a very

productive day.

ELLIOT
Is it Joey?

KATE
Joey? Joey hardly said a word to
me today, but if you were around
more, you’d see that that’s the

norm.

ELLIOT
What is it, Kate? The neighbor

again?

(CONTINUED)
 
34.

CONTINUED: (2)

KATE
No, Elliot. It’s your uncle. When it’s loud music, it’s easy to tell them to turn it down. But if it’s Uncle Ben chatting away, it’s a lot harder to tell him to shut up.


INT. LAW OFFICE - DAY

A tiny hole-in-the-wall law office. A LAWYER is sitting at his desk, typing on his computer.

LAWYER
Your mortgage was for $480,000, on a 30 year fixed rate.

George is sitting on the chair in front of him. He is holding a manila file folder with a bunch of loose papers in it.

GEORGE
Yes, but we bought it for

$600,000.

LAWYER
In 2007, is that correct?

GEORGE
Yes, when it went co-op.

LAWYER
And we’re getting $750,000 now.

That’s robust.

GEORGE
I thought so.

LAWYER
You’re lucky things have gone up since ‘08. Many people who bought when you did have lost money selling.

GEORGE
But that’s why I’m trying to
understand why we are only

seeing....

He opens his folder and looks through a few pages, searching for the number.

GEORGE (CONT’D)
Why we are only seeing $17,535 in

profit?

(CONTINUED)
 
35.

CONTINUED:

LAWYER
Well to start with you have to
take into account the closing
costs, which I told you about

previously.

GEORGE
Can you just remind me.

LAWYER
There’s the 1% New York City
transfer tax, the .04% New York
State tax, plus the 6% to me,

that’s $60,000 right there.

GEORGE
I understand all that. But from my calculations...

He looks down at his paperwork.

GEORGE (CONT’D)
....that should still leave...

LAWYER
Don’t forget your co-op, also, has a flip tax of 25% on whatever profit you make, if you sell before 5 years, so that’s another...

GEORGE
But this is 5 years!

George bangs his fist on his lap.

GEORGE (CONT’D)
It’s been five years. We bought in

2007 and it’s 2013 now.

LAWYER
But Mr. Garea, you didn’t actually close until January, if you remember, so that was 2008, and they go by the calendar year, so you would actually have to sell in 2014 to avoid the flip tax.

GEORGE
This is really like Kafka.
 






(CONTINUED)
 
36.

CONTINUED: (2)

LAWYER
If you had been able to pay a
little more of your principle,
either as a down payment, or with

your mortgage. As of the sale..

The broker looks at his computer screen.

LAWYER
...$12,996 is what you had paid

off of your principal, Mr. Garea

GEORGE
After we paid $1,900 dollars every month to the bank?

LAWYER
That’s because of the amortization schedule. Your payments in the beginning are largely going towards the interest, and only a smaller part towards the principal. I hope someone explained that to you previously.

GEORGE
It just never sounds very fair to

me.

LAWYER
Look at it this way: you’ve lived
in a nice apartment for 20 years,
five of that...
(he catches himself,
laughing awkwardly)
...or nearly five, as an owner,
and now you sold it at a profit.
You’re getting...
(looking at his
screen)
$17,535 dollars, which is all

yours.

George looks completely at a loss, like a bag of heavy stones.

LAWYER
Listen, I won’t charge you for
today, if that is any help. We’ll

call it a courtesy.
 
37.


ELLIOT AND KATE’S APT, KITCHEN - NIGHT

The family is sitting at the dinner table, finishing their dinner. Elliot, Kate and Joey have their plates empty, while Ben still works on his meat, very, very slowly.

JOEY
Ours was about “mixed farming” which is when farmers manage a mix of different crops and animals.

ELLIOT
And why is that eco-friendly?

JOEY
Nobody says eco-friendly anymore,

dad.

KATE
It’s eco-efficient now.

JOEY
No, we say “sustainable”.

Sustainable agriculture.

ELLIOT
I see.

Kate looks at Ben, still cutting his meat. Elliot looks at Kate, looking at Ben, then at his own empty plate. Joey also looks at Ben’s plate, then up to the ceiling, impatience starting to boil in him.

ELLIOT
So why is mixed farming

sustainable?

JOEY
Cause that’s when crop residues are used to feed the animals and the... the excrements from animals are used as nutrients for the crop.

KATE
Eewwww. Your uncle is still

eating, Joey.

JOEY
I’m sorry.

BEN
What?
 

(CONTINUED)
 
38.

CONTINUED:

Ben wasn’t paying attention to the conversation, lost in his thoughts while cutting the fat off his meat with an obsessive focus.

JOEY
Can I be excused? I still need to

study tonight.

KATE
You don’t want dessert?

ELLIOT
What do we have?

KATE
Strawberries and frozen yogurt.

JOEY
No thanks.

Joey gets up, takes his plate to the kitchen sink and leaves.

Ben takes a bite. Elliot looks at Kate, looking at Ben, chewing slowly...


INT. ROBERTO AND TED’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Roberto and Ted’s apartment is the same size as their ex-neighbors, but a very different decor. Where Ben and George’s was thoughtfully put together, with style and art, this one is simply functional. Where in the other one the piano commanded the space in the living room, in this one it’s the giant flat screen TV.

The TV is on, and Ted has a small control in his hand which commands the screen. He’s setting up his new Apple TV, going step by step. George is sitting next to him, eating a bowl of ice cream. Ted has a bottle of beer in front of him.

TED
It’s all through the wi-fi. This little box over there connects directly with our Netflix account, iTunes and with YouTube. Here let me show you.

Ted sips his beer, then manipulates the controls while the screen changes with different images.

TED
Have you seen this?
 

(CONTINUED)
 
39.

CONTINUED:

A huge dragon, a slave in a leather harness, a sexy princess - a Game of Thrones style show on TV.

GEORGE
No, what is this?

TED
You’ve never seen this? Game of
Thrones! It’s my favorite. Look,
that’s King Baratheon and Queen
Cersei. She hates him. Look, and
that’s Ser Jaime, with whom she
has an affair.

GEORGE
He’s sexy.

TED
He’s her twin brother and they’re lovers but it’s okay because it’s like medieval times in the future. I’m so glad you haven’t seen this, because you and I are going to watch it together.

GEORGE
Oh, are we?

TED
I have the whole first two seasons on my computer.

GEORGE
So your computer has to be on.

TED
No, not at all. It’s all sync’d

through the Cloud.

GEORGE
What’s the Cloud?

TED
The Cloud is like an imaginary hard disk. It has all your info so all your different gadgets can be synch’ed through the wi-fi.

George is not listening. He’s tired. He stares at his empty bowl.

GEORGE
Is there any more ice cream, Ted?
 



(CONTINUED)
 
40.

CONTINUED: (2)

TED
Yes, I think so.

The door opens, and in comes Roberto in his police outfit, with his police woman buddy, DOREEN, both coming from work. He carries a bag of groceries and a six pack of beer.

ROBERTO
I’m hungry!

TED
Look, baby. I got it hooked up.

DOREEN
Hey guys!

Without ever letting go of the mini control, Ted stands up and high fives Doreen - she’s clearly one of the guys.

TED
Doreen!

ROBERTO
Hey George, you’ve met my friend

Doreen, right?

George stands up to shake her hand, as she drowns herself on the couch.

DOREEN
Hi George.

ROBERTO
Babe, come help me in the kitchen?

TED
In two minutes.

Roberto disappears into the kitchen. Ted keeps playing with the remote.

George sits again, and Doreen taps him on his thigh, friendly.

DOREEN
So how are your two new daddies

treating you?

GEORGE
Oh I can’t complain.

DOREEN
I’ve always liked this couch. I’ve taken good naps here.

(CONTINUED)
 
41.

CONTINUED: (3)

GEORGE
It’s a good bed too.

DOREEN
If I drink too much... Maybe I’ll

sleep with you here tonight.

ROBERTO (O.S.)
Adams or Corona?

DOREEN
(screams)
Whichever is colder!
(to Ted and George)

You guys?

TED
I think I’ll have wine.

GEORGE
(to Ted)

What happened to my ice cream?

TED
Did you mean to ask me if I would

get you some ice cream, George?

GEORGE
Yes. I think because you’re from
Manhasset, you don’t understand

the subtlety.

TED
No, I understood perfectly well. I just prefer when people are direct.

A beat of silence. Doreen takes the remote control from Ted’s hands.

DOREEN
Go help Roberto. I’ll finish this

for you.

TED
Do you even know how to?

DOREEN
Show me some respect, soldier.


INT. ROBERTO AND TED’S APARTMENT / KITCHEN - NIGHT

Ted takes out the groceries from the bag, while Roberto gets a heavy tupperware out of the refrigerator.

(CONTINUED)
 
42.

CONTINUED:

He opens it, sniffs it out and shows it to Ted.

TED
That’s not enough. Who else is

coming?

ROBERTO
Just Linda.

TED
Should I invite Marco?

ROBERTO
Sure. I’ll add some chicken to the curry, and what else?

They’re briefly interrupted by Doreen’s voice coming from the living room.

DOREEN (O.S.)
(...) your iPhoto as screen saver?

TED
(screams to the other
room)
Sure!
(back to ROBERTO)
I can make the basmati with
broccoli, and a big salad.

ROBERTO
Perfect.


INT. ROBERTO AND TED’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Sitting alone at the dinner table, away from everybody else for privacy, George talks on the phone. He looks on as Doreen takes her boots off and drinks beer, making herself comfortably at home.

GEORGE
(on the phone)
...it seems like they’re just
starting dinner now. (...) No,
tomorrow I have a student in the

morning....

George keeps talking on the phone, and he sees Doreen going to open the door. From afar, he now sees Doreen hugging and kissing a newcomer: her partner LINDA, who arrives with a BABY.
 




(CONTINUED)
 
43.

CONTINUED:

GEORGE (CONT’D)
(on the phone)
Me? I’ve eaten already. (...) I
stopped at the diner and had some
matzo ball soup. (...) No, no

grilled cheese, I swear.


INT. ELLIOT AND KATE’S APT, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Ben is alone by the large window in the dark living room of his nephew’s apartment. All around is quiet, the whole apartment seems to be asleep - only the light from the street outside, and a quiet conversation that Ben is having over the phone.

BEN
(on the phone)

I made beef stew tonight. (...) I think they did. They ate the whole thing, but they didn’t say anything.(...) No, they’re very nice, but sometimes when you live with people, you know them better than you care to - that’s all. (...)

The large, empty and dark living room. Silence. Ben stays by the window, his profile catching the outside light.

EXT. ROOFTOP ELLIOT AND KATE’S BDG - DAY

Ben is behind his standing easel on this Park Slope outdoor rooftop. Around him, there are only tree tops and neighboring rooftops, the sun and a nice breeze. Ben, wearing his dirty painters’s apron, is sketching away with a thin paintbrush on a new canvas.

He looks up and back down to the canvas.

And in front of him, standing proud as a statue, is Vlad wearing a tank top and holding HIS SKATEBOARD, the model of Ben’s new painting.

Ben uses his fingers to blur and fix a couple of lines, redrawing details on the canvas.

The noisy metal door to the rooftop opens with a CLANK. Ben raises his eyes above the canvas, to see that an out of breath and very surprised Joey is standing between him and his subject Vlad.

JOEY
What the fuck, Vlad!

(CONTINUED)
 
44.

CONTINUED:

VLAD
I’m posing for your uncle’s new

masterpiece.

JOEY
(to Vlad)

That is so gay!

An awkward silence, as Ben continues to paint.

BEN
People have been modeling for
painters for centuries now. All

kinds of people.

Joey looks at Vlad one more time, to see that his friend continues to “pose”, enjoying his 15 minutes of fame.

VLAD
He doesn’t mean homosexual, Ben.

He just means stupid.

BEN
Don’t worry Vlad. Joey and I

understand each other.

Joey walks behind Ben and looks over his shoulder at the painting.

JOEY
You’re not a good artist anyway.

BEN
I know you don’t mean that, Joey.

JOEY
But I do. If you were, you
wouldn’t have to crash on a bunk

bed in your nephew’s house!

Joey walks away. A door in the distance CLANKS shut.


INT. ELLIOT AND KATE’S APT, LIVING ROOM - DAY (CONTINUOUS)

Kate is writing at the desk in the living room. Joey comes in.

KATE
Did you find him?

JOEY
He’s on the fucking rooftop with

Uncle Ben.

(CONTINUED)
 
45.

CONTINUED:

KATE
Hey! Watch your language.

Joey goes into his bedroom.

Kate takes a deep breath, a sip from her tea and tries to go back to her writing. But soon Joey storms out of his room.

JOEY
I’m going out.

KATE
And Vlad?

JOEY
Uncle Ben is making him pose for a painting.

KATE
He’s what??

JOEY
You heard me.

KATE
Joey, wait a minute. I suggested to your Uncle Ben that he take his painting to the roof. It was my idea. Don’t you see? I need to work here.

JOEY
I need to go.

And he leaves.


INT. STAIRWELL - DAY

In the dark stairwell of the building, Ben is carrying his painting box and canvas, while Vlad comes from outside helping him with all the rest: easel, skateboard and the box of paintings. Suddenly, he stops.

BEN
You okay there?

The bottom of the easel got stuck on the door. Vlad gives it a little kick, and the door closes with a CLANK.

VLAD
We’re good.
 



(CONTINUED)
 
46.

CONTINUED:

Ben tries a switch on the wall, but the main light doesn’t go on.

BEN
Oh well.

It’s dark, and Ben is careful step by step.


INT. ELLIOT AND KATE’S APT, LIVING ROOM - DAY

Kate is concentrating on work, typing away on her computer, when Vlad comes in loaded with Ben’s easel, painting materials and his skateboard.

Kate stops writing and goes to Vlad.

KATE
Vlad, what were you doing up

there?

VLAD
I was helping Ben with his

painting.

KATE
Weren’t you supposed to be

studying biology?

VLAD
It’s going to be all about this
book on seasons and migrations,

and I know the book pretty well.

KATE
But if you flunk the test
tomorrow, what am I going to tell
your mother when she calls and
asks if you and Joey were really

studying or just playing here?

VLAD
I don’t flunk.

Ben arrives, in his paint splashed apron, carrying the canvas with him.

VLAD
Ben, where should I leave this?

BEN
Just leave it there. I’ll take

care of it.
 



(CONTINUED)
 
47.

CONTINUED:

KATE
Listen, Vlad, when you’re here,

you’re my responsibility.

Kate makes sure Ben is listening to this as he picks up his easel on the floor.

KATE (CONT’D)
So if you have a biology test
tomorrow, you should be studying
with Joey, instead of taking art

lessons on the roof.

VLAD
Where is Joey?

KATE
He went to the library.

VLAD
I guess I’ll go meet him there.

KATE
I think that’s a good idea.

Vlad gets his skateboard and backpack, and heads to the door.

KATE
Do you want to take some food,

some water or anything?

VLAD
I’m okay. Thank you, Mrs. Hull.

Bye, Ben. I’ll see you soon.

BEN
Bye Vlad.

KATE
Okay, Bye.

Vlad leaves. Kate goes back to her desk, while Ben takes the rest of his stuff into the bedroom.

Kate is quietly typing away.

BEN (O.S.)
I didn’t know they were supposed

to be studying.

Kate turns and sees, to her surprise, Ben on the couch with a book. She keeps on typing, trying to write.
 


(CONTINUED)
 
48.

CONTINUED: (2)

BEN
Joey got very upset. He called
Vlad “gay” in quite an offensive

fashion.

KATE
Kids have broadened the meaning of the word “gay” far beyond sexual orientation, so don’t get offended.

BEN
I didn’t, really. I guess it just

means ‘stupid’ now.

KATE
I think you’re right.

BEN
I don’t know if Joey felt left
out, or what in the world was

going through his mind.

Kate stops typing, and closes her laptop and stands up, gathering all of her things, impatient.

KATE
They’re teenagers. And is it
really appropriate to be using

Joey’s friend as a model?

She walks towards her bedroom, carrying her laptop, notebooks and pen.


INT. ELLIOT AND KATE’S APT, BATHROOM - NIGHT

A very steamy bathroom, one can hardly see anything inside. Someone is quietly taking a very hot shower. The water gets shut off, but the person still stays inside the box for a moment, as if enjoying the last drops from the shower - a quiet meditative moment.

Finally, the box opens, and Ben grabs a towel. He starts to dry himself off.


INT. MINDY’S HOUSE - NIGHT

A small house with bland worn out furniture, and dog toys scattered around the place. It’s quite dark inside, and there are three DOGS of different breeds, each lying lazily in his/her own cushion. They pretty much own the place.
 

(CONTINUED)
 
49.

CONTINUED:

The phone rings. Mindy enters. She has a slight dazed look on her face, maybe from a nap - or a couple of martinis. She has to get around one of the dogs to get to the phone, and knocks her foot onto the table.

MINDY
Ouch! Son of bitch. Ouch, oh!
(on the phone)
Hello? (...) Oh hi, Kate! How are

you? (...)

As she listens, she sits on the couch and grabs a cigarette from a pack on the coffee table.

MINDY (CONT’D)
(on the phone)

Oh, I’m good. Everything is great - amazing, actually. Yes, I went to see this chromotherapist up in Kingston.

She lights the cigarette.

MINDY (CONT’D)
(on the phone)
Chromotherapy! (...) The guy talks
to you for 15 minutes, then he
floats his hand all over your body
and he feels whatever type of
energy you’re lacking - physical,
emotional, spiritual. It’s hard to
explain. But he feels the energy
levels and then prescribes colored
lights to restore your balance. I
was just taking a nap under a
greenish light he gave me. You
wouldn’t believe it, but I feel
like I’m a different person. I
have much more energy, and (...)
Hun-hun, I know. And how’s Uncle
Ben? (...) Uh-hun, I know. It must
be hard for him. (...) I know, I

see.


INT. ELLIOT AND KATE’S APT - NIGHT

Ben, in a bath robe, his hair still wet, is standing outside the closed door to Kate’s bedroom. For a moment he hears her voice, then knocks on the door.

KATE (O.S.)
Come in!
 



(CONTINUED)
 
50.

CONTINUED:

BEN
Sorry, I didn’t want to interrupt.

KATE
Yes, Ben?

BEN
I wanted to talk about earlier.

KATE
Oh no, it’s fine.

BEN
Are you sure?

KATE
Yes, I’m talking to Mindy.
(a voice on the
phone)
She wants to know when you’re
going to visit her in
Poughkeepsie.

BEN
Ah, send her my love. We can talk

tomorrow.

KATE
Okay.

Ben shuts the door. He stands still for a moment, taking in what he’s just heard, and then walks away.


INT. WAITING ROOM / AFFORDABLE HOUSING, CITY HALL - DAY

Ben and George sit in a typically bureaucratic waiting room amongst other NEW YORKERS in search of a solution to their housing problems. The light is dim, and the mood is downcast.

Ben watches an old-fashioned TV set that hangs from the corner of the ceiling, showing a day time soap opera. George is searching through the files he has in a satchel on his lap.

A door opens and a SOCIAL WORKER, a woman in her 50s, enters.

SOCIAL WORKER (O.S.)
(to both men)

Mr. Garea?
 




(CONTINUED)
 
51.

CONTINUED:

GEORGE
That’s me. This is Mr. Hull. I’d

like him to come with me.

SOCIAL WORKER
(cool, efficient)

Right this way.

She motions them both to follow her.


INT. OFFICE / AFFORDABLE HOUSING, CITY HALL - DAY

The Social Worker searches for and separates brochures, applications and other paperwork from piles on her messy desk.

SOCIAL WORKER
These apartments are city
sponsored and are currently
accepting applications. Tenants
are selected by a lottery, but
first you need to meet the
criteria for the specific
development. Each one has its own.

She hands some paperwork in their general direction.

SOCIAL WORKER
I only have one, I’m sorry.

BEN
We can share.

SOCIAL WORKER
The city itself does not rent the apartments. If you get selected, this will be a private real estate transaction between you and the real estate developer, understand?

George is trying to. Ben less so.

SOCIAL WORKER
You need to contact the developer or the marketing agent directly - you’ll see the phone numbers and other info on the list I just gave you.

GEORGE
I have a question.

George pauses, quite suddenly. The Social Worker looks up from her paper work, expectantly.

(CONTINUED)
 
52.

CONTINUED:

GEORGE
We’re married. We would be

applying together.

First time he says “married”. It feels funny to say that. George and Ben both look at the Social Worker searching for a reaction, and see no reaction at all: she’s a NYC Social Worker after all.

SOCIAL WORKER
Okay.

GEORGE (CONT’D)
So, for example:
(reads from the list)
One bedroom in Ft.
Greene/Wallabout. Rent	$511.00.
Minimum income $19,509, maximum
income $23,240. Would that be for
both tenants?

SOCIAL WORKER
Yes. Both, together. Anything you find interesting there, check to see if you meet the criteria, and if you do, you’ll need to ask for an application directly from them. Remember to include a self addressed envelope with your request.

GEORGE
Okay.

George takes a look at some of the lists she gave him. A moment of silence between them.

SOCIAL WORKER
That’s all I have for now.

BEN
Sounds like a good start.

SOCIAL WORKER
Typically demand exceeds supply
for those apartments, so we
suggest that you enter multiple
lotteries, and use other means for
pursuing housing such as
classified ads, online listings,
brokers, and word-of-mouth.

GEORGE
Thank you very much.
 

(CONTINUED)
 
53.

CONTINUED: (2)

SOCIAL WORKER
Use common sense and beware of
deals that sound too good to be

true.

GEORGE
Thanks.

The Social Worker observes Ben getting up from his chair.

SOCIAL WORKER
Sir. Can I ask a question?

BEN
Yes?

SOCIAL WORKER
How old are you?

BEN
I’m 71.

SOCIAL WORKER
Because you might want to try the

DFTA also?

GEORGE
DFTA?

She hands him yet another piece of paper.

SOCIAL WORKER
Department for the Aging.

BEN
They have a whole department just

for us? Isn’t that encouraging...

George doesn’t know if he should laugh or cry.

SOCIAL WORKER
They have a list of affordable
senior housing. It usually has a
waiting list, but it’s worth a

try.


INT. ROBERTO AND TED’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

George comes into an almost surreal scene in front of him:
 





(CONTINUED)
 
54.

CONTINUED:

Ted, wearing a medieval warrior hat, Roberto, Doreen, and Marco’s boyfriend, VINNIE, heavy set, with a beard, wearing a heavy metal band T-shirt, are sitting around the dinner table, which is covered with Dungeon & Dragons paraphernalia: the game’s navigation maze, miniature snakes, monsters, vampires and medieval warriors; polyhedral multicolored dices, different manuals and, of course, lots of beer, popcorn and bags of Doritos. There’s also a bottle of Tequila.

TED
Hey George, do you want some beer?

ROBERTO
Tequila?

GEORGE
I’m kind of hungry, actually.

ROBERTO
We’re still waiting for Marco.

DOREEN
Don’t you guys think George would

be a great Lycanthrope?

VINNIE
A Cockatrice.

DOREEN
He’d be a perfect Lamia.

George strikes a pose as what/who he thinks Lamia is.

GEORGE
(sexy)

Lamia!

They laugh. Roberto laughs a little too much, his face flushed from the alcohol.

GEORGE
You guys seem to be having fun.

TED
Come play with us, you’ll love it.

GEORGE
It looks very complicated.

DOREEN
Have a beer and just watch - best

way to learn this game.
 



(CONTINUED)
 
55.

CONTINUED: (2)

GEORGE
I will, but I think I’ll eat a

little something first.

ROBERTO
There’s curry in the fridge.


INT. ROBERTO AND TED’S APARTMENT / KITCHEN - NIGHT (CONT.)

George puts a plate in the microwave, and enters two minutes on the timer.

He picks up a paper towel and cleans the counter, waiting for his food, as he listens to chatter coming from the living room.

DOREEN (O.S.)
I’m going to roll a perception
check.
(dice rolling)

31.

TED (O.S.)
You see a door.

DOREEN (O.S.)
I got a 31! All I see is a door?

TED (O.S.)
It’s a spooky door.

ROBERTO (O.S.)
That’s fucked up.

DOREEN (O.S.)
I open the door.

TED (O.S.)
Wait! Strength check.

DOREEN (O.S.)
On a door?

TED (O.S.)
It’s a heavy door.

DOREEN (O.S.)
Is it locked?

TED (O.S.)
Yes.
 



(CONTINUED)
 
56.

DOREEN (O.S.)
Whatever.

D29.

The microwave beeps next to George. He picks up a hot plate of curry.


INT. ROBERTO AND TED’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

The guys continue to play the game in full force. Vinnie jumps from his chair.

ROBERTO
I have dark vision. Can I see

what’s at the end of the hallway?

DOREEN
You cannot, because...
(with excitement)

It’s a Vampire Queen.

ROBERTO
(pretends a fright)

Uh! What’s her challenge rating?

DOREEN
Her challenge rating is 18.

ROBERTO
18? That’s kind of high for a

Vampire Queen, don’t you think?

DOREEN
I said 18!

ROBERTO
C’mon! Okay, you’re the DM but you can’t do that.

DOREEN
Yes I can. I’m the DM; I can do

whatever I want.

ROBERTO
Bitch.

Roberto picks up a baton from the table.

ROBERTO
I’m going to use the wand of

wounding.
 



(CONTINUED)
 
57.

CONTINUED:

DOREEN
No way!

Doreen is fast and takes the baton from Roberto’s hand.

ROBERTO
Give me that!

Roberto grabs Doreen, who hugs the baton tight, so Roberto can’t take it away from her. She’s laughing, but Roberto is seriously upset.

TED
Stop!

Frustrated, and drunk, Roberto ends up pushing Doreen, and grabbing the baton and cleaning out the table, effectively messing up the whole game.

TED
Oh c’mon baby!

There are boos and protests from Doreen and Vinnie.

They don’t even notice as, in the background, George crosses the room towards the door.

He opens the door and Marco is there in a camouflage raincoat. He is closing an umbrella, dripping wet.

MARCO
George! You don’t want to go out
there, my friend. It’s really

coming down.

George passes by him.

GEORGE
Thank you. I’ll be fine.


INT. ELLIOT AND KATE’S APT, KITCHEN - NIGHT

Kate and Elliot are washing dishes, while Ben is still at the table, slowly eating his dinner.

We can hear the rain falling heavily outside.

ELLIOT
Do you think he’s old enough to

enjoy the Louvre?

KATE
He’s obsessed with the French

Revolution.

(CONTINUED)
 
58.

CONTINUED:

ELLIOT
But he doesn’t need to go to Paris to learn about the guillotine.

KATE
It’s a group of eight boys and
girls, and they need two more so

they can get the discount.

ELLIOT
Is Vlad going?

KATE
Yes.

ELLIOT
Of course.

KATE
Of course.

ELLIOT
How much is it?

KATE
Eighteen hundred, hotel included.

The buzzer rings, interrupting the conversation. Kate shuts the water and looks at Elliot, confounded by the intrusion.

ELLIOT
Speak of the devil.

KATE
Who?

ELLIOT
(looking at his
watch)

10PM. That would be Vlad.

The buzzer rings again, as Kate reaches for the intercom.

KATE
Who is it?

GEORGE (O.S.)
(through the
intercom)

It’s George.
 
59.


INT. ELLIOT AND KATE’S APT, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Ben opens the door, and George comes in, all wet from the rain outside.

BEN
What happened??

George gives him a hug, a very tight hug, and starts to cry.

GEORGE
I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I’m sorry.

BEN
Stop it. Don’t be silly.

They hug each other tightly, George now crying like a baby.

Elliot observes the scene from a distance. Kate wants to step forward to help out, but Elliot stops her from moving.


INT. ELLIOT AND KATE’S APT, JOEY’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Joey is at his desk in front of the computer. Elliot comes in.

ELLIOT
Son, I need to ask you a favor.

JOEY
What is it?

ELLIOT
Do you mind sleeping on the couch

tonight?

JOEY
C’mon, Dad.

ELLIOT
George is here. He’s upset, and
it’s raining. It’s only for

tonight.

JOEY
Why can’t he sleep on the couch?

ELLIOT
Because. Please, son.
 
60.


INT. ELLIOT AND KATE’S APT, BEDROOM - NIGHT

Kate reads to the light of her bedside lamp. Elliot is under the covers, asleep beside her.


INT. ELLIOT AND KATE’S APT, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

The back pillows of the couch are thrown on the floor, and Joey is already asleep under a blanket.


INT. ELLIOT AND KATE’S APT, JOEY’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Ben is in the bottom bunk. George is in the top. They are talking very quietly, intimately.

GEORGE
I talked to the Principal there at PS-216, who seemed very nice and smart. He really wants to bring back a music program.

BEN
Do they have the budget for it?

GEORGE
Not right now, but he seems like
he might be very good at raising
money. He has a very attractive

personality.

BEN
That doesn’t really help us much

right now, does it?

GEORGE
I haven’t finished my story. Can I finish it?

BEN
They don’t have a job for you,

isn’t that the end?

GEORGE
No, it’s not. You’re such a

pessimist.

BEN
I’m being realistic.

GEORGE
Let me finish!
 



(CONTINUED)
 
61.

CONTINUED:

BEN
Okay. Go ahead.

GEORGE
Thank you. They have all kinds of kids there: lots of black and latin, but also white, a few Asians. This really cute girl, Filipino, I think she was. She played Frere Jacques for me on her flute.

BEN
George, why don’t you come down

here so I can hear you better.

GEORGE
It’s a bunk bed.

BEN
So?

GEORGE
You told me Joey was already
losing his patience with you. Can
you imagine if you broke his bed

trying to shag your husband.

BEN
I have missed having your body
next to mine too much to have it
denied to me for reasons of bad

engineering.

George sits up, and moves to the edge of the bed. He awkwardly maneuvers himself on to the ladder and down the side.

Ben is squished as far as he can be to the wall, waiting for George with the sheets pulled back.

George gets into the bed with him.

They take each other in for a long moment.

GEORGE
Do you ever blame me for all of

this?

BEN
Why would I blame you? We did it

together.
 




(CONTINUED)
 
62.

CONTINUED: (2)

GEORGE
But I knew what might happen. I
knew more than you what we were

risking.

BEN
All I know is that after 39 years
it’s hard to fall asleep without
you.	This situation we’ve gotten
ourselves in is really fucking

with my sleeping patterns.


INT. PIANO STUDENT’S HOME - DAY

A YOUNG GIRL plays at the grand Steinway piano, in this upper middle class apartment. Even though the metronome on top of the piano is giving a certain rhythm, the Girl seems to be following no one in her interpretation of this Prelude by Chopin.

George walks around the Girl, and the piano, listening carefully. And as soon as the Girl finishes...

GEORGE
What happened?

The Girl looks at him somehow surprised at his reaction

GEORGE
What was that?! That wasn’t what

we talked about last week.

GIRL
Interpretation.

GEORGE
Yes, and I insist that it is crucial to let the music take you someplace, to be surprised by it, even to allow yourself to be overwhelmed sometimes. That is as important as knowing the difference between a semitone and a half-step. But at the same time, you have to stay focused on the instrument you’re playing, and listen. Always - listen! What is the metronome telling you...
(clap his hands)
...tik - tok - tik!! You-ha-ve-to--fol-low! You can’t just create your own rhythm to Chopin. Let’s do it again.
 

(CONTINUED)
 
63.

CONTINUED:



The Girl is back at the Prelude. George paces back and forth for a moment, listening, then sits on a bench behind her. He sees when the Girl’s MOTHER shows up quietly, discreetly, peeking from the corridor, smiling at George and listening.

The Chopin Prelude soars. The girl plays it well. George listens with attention to the music, and seems moved by it.

GEORGE (V.O.)
Dear parents,

By now you have all heard of my joyful news, and of my sad news. To be able to finally marry my partner of almost 40 years, Benjamin Hull, in a small ceremony here at the New York City Hall was one of the happiest moments of my life. Unfortunately, later I found out that I could no longer continue to teach music at St. Grace’s.


INT. ST. GRACE’S SCHOOL/CLASSROOM (DOCUMENTARY STYLE) - DAY

A PRIEST drawing numbers of an equation on the blackboard, teaching math to a class.

At their desks, the UNIFORMED STUDENTS, some paying attention, some absent-mindedly looking out the window, others making notes.

The Chopin Prelude continues to play over these scenes.

GEORGE (V.O., CONT.) Most of you, and everyone at the school, knew that I was gay and that Ben was my life-long partner. I have always had nothing but support from all of you, so I would like to thank you, and also to emphasize that I understand that what happened is not the fault of St. Grace’s and its leadership.
 
64.


INT. ST. GRACE’S SCHOOL/HALLWAY - DAY

Students in the hallways, at their lockers, some running, while others confering with a teacher, and with each other.

GEORGE (V.O., CONT.) Above all, I urge you to take this opportunity to have a conversation with your children about whether or not justice was served here.


INT. ST. GRACE’S SCHOOL/GYMNASIUM - DAY

A basketball court; the boys sweating, playing, competitive.


INT. ST. GRACE’S SCHOOL/AUDITORIUM - DAY

Students get ready for a dress rehearsal. They put on their gowns, and walk up the steps of the chorus.

GEORGE (V.O., CONT) The last thing I want them to take from this is that they should hide who they are, or what they think, if they believe it will get them into trouble. Life has its obstacles, but I’ve learned early on that they will always be lessened if faced with honesty.
