EXT. MANCHESTER HARBOR -- SEA. DAY.
A small commercial fishing boat heads out of Manchester, Massachusetts, toward the open sea. JOE CHANDLER, late 30s, is in the wheelhouse. In the stern are LEE CHANDLER, Joe’s younger brother by five years, and Joe’s son PATRICK, about 9 years old. Lee and Patrick are kidding around in a friendly way while Joe steers.
SEVEN YEARS LATER -- THE PRESENT
EXT. BOSTON -- QUINCY -- APARTMENT HOUSE. DAY.
It’s a cold winter day on a narrow street.
In front of a small apartment building, LEE sweeps away the old snow on the pavement, then sprinkles salt in front of the building. He is 40 now, wearing janitor’s coveralls under his weatherbeaten winter jacket.
INT. BATHROOM. DAY.
Lee works on a leaky toilet while MR MARTINEZ, 50s, a big man in an undershirt and glasses, stands by watching.
MR MARTINEZ
I don’t know why the hell it keeps dripping. All night long, drip, drip. I’ve had the fucking thing repaired ten times.
LEE
You need a new stopper.
MR MARTINEZ
Oh is that it?
LEE
See how it’s rotted around the
edges? It doesn’t make a seal, so
the water drips into the bowl. I
can bring you a new one tomorrow,
or you might want to consider
replacing the whole apparatus.
MARTINEZ
What do you recommend?
Lee starts putting away his tools and cleaning up.
2.
LEE
Well, I could replace the stopper first, and if that doesn’t work, then I would come back and replace the whole apparatus.
MARTINEZ
But you don’t have a professional
recommendation?
LEE
It’s really up to you.
MARTINEZ
Well, tomorrow I got my sister-in-law coming over with my nephews ... and I gotta take my car in... 
Lee waits while Mr Martinez works out his schedule.
INT. BASEMENT. DAY.
He organizes the trash cans and recycling in the basement.
INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY. DAY.
He vacuums the hall with an industrial vacuum cleaner on a fifty foot yellow extension cord.
EXT. QUINCY -- ANOTHER BUILDING. DAY.
A different apartment building on a similar street.
INT. MRS GROOM’S APARTMENT. DAY.
Standing on a ladder in a small grandmotherly apartment, Lee changes a light bulb in the very small bathroom. MRS GROOM, 70s, is on the phone outside the open bathroom door.
MRS GROOM
(On the phone)
No, it’s my sister Janine’s oldest girl’s bat mitzvah... No, I look forward to being bored to death...  No, the girl doesn’t want it, the
father doesn’t want it. I don’t
ask. Seven hours in the car, I
could really slit my throat... Oh,
well, the little girls are
charming.
3.
EXT. QUINCY -- A SLIGHTLY MORE UPSCALE STREET. DUSK.
A marginally more upscale building.
INT. BATHROOM. DUSK.
Lee looks down at a stopped-up toilet. Behind him is MARIANNE, slender, 30s, attractive, wearing everyday around-the-house clothes.
MARIANNE
I am so sorry. This is so gross.
LEE
It’s all right.
He plunges her toilet carefully and methodically.
LATER -- He wipes up the floor. Marianne comes in.
MARIANNE
Oh Lee, you don’t have to do that, honestly.
LEE
That’s OK.
MARIANNE
Well -- God. Thank you so much, I
am so sorry.
LATER -- He is washing his hands in her bathroom sink. He hears Marianne talking on the phone O.C.
MARIANNE (CONT’D)
No, tell him to come! ...  Okay,
yeah ...  But Cindy, I have to tell
you something. I'm like, in love
with my handyman. Is that sick? ...  Have you ever had a sexual fantasy about your handyman? ...  Well, it's awkward because he is literally like, cleaning the shit out of my toilet bowl right now. And I don't think I'm at my most alluring ... 
Yeah, maybe you're right. It's not like I met him socially ...  Okay thank you Cindy. You’re a really good friend ...  OK like twenty minutes. ‘Bye!
IN HER SMALL LIVING ROOM -- He comes out of the bathroom.
Marianne is now dressed up to go out. She looks great.
4.
LEE
All set.
MARIANNE
Thank you so much. Can I give you a tip?
LEE
You mean, like a suggestion?
MARIANNE
(Taking out a ten)
No -- I mean -- like, a tip... 
LEE
That’s all right. Have a good
night.
MARIANNE
Oh, please. I’d feel bad.
LEE
(Takes the money)
OK, thanks a lot. Good night.
MARIANNE
Good night! And thank you so much.
INT. MRS OLSEN’S BATHROOM. DAY.
Lee is down on his hand and knees. MRS OLSEN, 40s, in a bathrobe, is very good-looking but bad-tempered and nervous.
MRS OLSEN
How many times do we have to fix these fucking pipes? Every time I take a shower their entire apartment has a flood. It’s driving me insane.
LEE
I’ll bring the plumber tomorrow but I’d say we’re gonna have to break through the tile and try to isolate the leak, because there was quite a lot of water --
MRS OLSEN
But how do you know it’s me? Why is it automatically me?
LEE
Because if it was coming from
higher up you’d have water damage
on the ceiling too, and maybe in
your wall, and it’s all dry.
5.
MRS OLSEN
Great.
Lee looks at the bathtub.
LEE
It might just be the caulking. This whole tub needs to be re-caulked. Did you take a bath or shower in the last couple of hours?
MRS OLSEN
Yes... 
LEE
Well, it could actually just be
that.
MRS OLSEN
OK.	And how are you planning to
find that out?
LEE
Well, we could turn on the shower
and see if it drips downstairs... 
MRS OLSEN
You want me to take a shower now?
LEE
No... 
MRS OLSEN
You want me to take a shower while you stand there watching, to see if the water drips down into the Friedrich’s apartment?
LEE
I don’t really give a fuck what you do, Mrs. Olsen. I just want to find the leak.
Mrs Olsen goes white with shock and fury.
MRS OLSEN
No, you can get out of my apartment and don’t ever come back.
LEE
MRS OLSEN (CONT'D)
OK.
How dare you fucking talk to
me like that? Get the fuck
out of my house before I call
the police!
LEE
You’re blockin’ the doorway.
6.
INT. MR EMERY’S OFFICE. NIGHT.
The building manager’s office. MR EMERY is in his 50s. Lee sits in the chair before the crowded desk.
EMERY
What the fuck’s matter with you? You can’t talk to the tenants like that!
Lee shrugs.
EMERY (CONT’D)
Look, Lee. You do a good job.
You’re dependable. But I get these
complaints all the time. You’re
rude, you’re unfriendly, you don’t
say good mornin’. I mean come on!
LEE
Mr Emery, I fix the plumbing. I take out the garbage. I paint their apartments. I do electrical work -- which we both know is against the law. I show up on time, I’m workin’ four buildings and you get all the money. So do whatever you’re gonna do.
EMERY
Would you be willin’ to apologize
to Mrs Olsen?
LEE
For what?
EMERY
All right, all right, I’ll talk to her.
Lee gets up to go.
INT. A LOUD QUINCY BAR. NIGHT.
Lee drinks alone at a small, crowded neighborhood bar.
AT THE BAR -- Lee is waiting for service. Someone bumps a CUTE GIRL, 30s, into him. She spills some beer on Lee.
GIRL
LEE
Oh my God, I’m sorry! Did I
That’s OK. I’m OK... 
get you? Yeah. Lemme get a
napkin. Lenny, could I get a
couple of napkins? (Gives Lee
some napkins.) Here you
are... 
7.
LEE (CONT’D)
Thanks.
GIRL
Well, now I spilled beer all over
you, my name’s Sharon.
LEE
That’s OK.
GIRL
And you are... 
LEE
Lee.
She gets the message that he is not interested. He pats himself dry, not looking at her.
LATER --
The bar is far less packed. We see SHARON across the room, talking to a girlfriend. At the bar, Lee is drinking alone. He’s pretty drunk by now. He is looking at two BUSINESSMEN, 40s. One of them notices and mentions it to the other. They look at him for a moment then ignore him. He gets up and walks toward them. They are surprised at his approach.
1ST BUSINESSMAN
How you doin’?
2ND BUSINESSMAN
How you doin’?
LEE
Good. I’m good. Can I ask you guys, have we met before?
The two men look at each other then back at Lee.
1ST BUSINESSMAN
I don’t think so.
2ND BUSINESSMAN
I don’t think so either.
LEE
So you guys don’t know me?
1ST BUSINESSMAN
2ND BUSINESSMAN
No... 
No, Yeah. No. Do we?
No.
LEE
Well then what the fuck are you
lookin’ at me for?
8.
2ND BUSINESSMAN
Excuse me?
LEE
I said why the fuck are you lookin’ at me?
1ST BUSINESSMAN	2ND BUSINESSMAN
Sir, we really weren’t	Hey! Take a fuckin’ walk. Hey
looking at you --	-- Paul -- No -- don’t
BARTENDER	apologize to this asshole--
(To LEE) Take a hike!
(Hurrying over)
Hey, Lee... Lee... !
Lee HITS the 2nd Businessman and knocks him into a wall.
Several pictures fall and smash on the floor.
BARTENDER
Oh, goddamnit --
Lee punches the 1st Businessman’s nose. He falls back and grabs his face, blood streaming from both nostrils. The 2nd Businessman and Lee swipe at each other.
1ST BUSINESSMAN
2ND BUSINESSMAN
You broke my fuckin’ nose!
Goddamn lunatic --
The BARTENDER leaps over the bar and grabs Lee from behind -- Other guys join in to break it up.
BARTENDER
VARIOUS VOICES
Lee! Lee! Lee! Enough!
Break it up! Break it up!
LEE
Lemme go. I gotta go take a hike.
General melee.
INT. LEE’S BASEMENT APARTMENT. NIGHT.
Lee turns the light on and comes in. He is a little roughed up from the fight.
At his dresser, Lee pulls on sweatpants and an undershirt. There are THREE FRAMED PHOTOS in imitation silver frames standing on the little dresser. We don’t see the photos.
Lee sits on the sofa with a beer and turns the TV on to a late-night sports program. Slowly he falls asleep. The can in his hand tips slowly sideways and spills onto the sofa.
9.
EXT. LEE’S STREET. DAY.
It’s snowing. Lots of slow, heavy flakes, very pretty.
EXT. LEE’S BUILDING -- WINTER. DAY.
Lee is shoveling snow. The air is clear and cold. The whole street is beautified by the recent snow storm. His iPhone rings. He takes off his gloves. Digs out the phone.
LEE
Hello ...  This is Lee ...  Oh ...  When did that happen? ...  Well, how is he? ...  OK. Uh... No. Don’t do that. I’ll come up right now ...  OK. Thank you.
He hangs up and goes inside with the shovel, leaving the snow before the building only partially cleared and salted down.
INT. LEE’S CAR (MOVING). DAY.
Lee sits behind the wheel, trying to get out of Boston and onto Rt 1. North. He’s talking on his iPhone.
LEE
(Into his iPhone)
Mr Emery, it’s Lee again. I contacted Jose, who says he can cover for me til Friday night at least, and then Gene MacAdavey can take over till I get back. I’ll be in Manchester at least a week or two. I’ll call again when I have more information. Goodbye.
He hangs up and drives into increasingly heavy traffic.
LEE (CONT’D)
Come on, come on.
The traffic slows. He becomes increasingly anxious.
EXT. RT. 128 -- LEE’S CAR (MOVING). DAY.
Lee’s car takes the exit for Beverly.
EXT. BEVERLY HOSPITAL. DAY.
Lee drives through the grounds of a big modern hospital. He knows exactly where he’s going. He parks and gets out. He walks quickly to the main entrance, then breaks into a run.
10.
INT. BEVERLY HOSPITAL. DAY.
We lead/follow Lee as he walks quickly through the halls toward the ICU, easily navigating the twists and turns from habit. He goes into the ICU --
INT. ICU -- NURSE’S STATION -- CONTINUOUS. DAY.
--	and approaches GEORGE, around 50, a big weatherbeaten guy, and NURSE IRENE, 40s. They both react as Lee approaches.
GEORGE
Hiya, Lee.
LEE
Is he dead?
George’s eyes fill with tears. He makes a helpless gesture.
NURSE IRENE
I’m sorry, Lee. He passed away
about an hour ago.
LEE
Oh.
NURSE IRENE
I’m so sorry.
Lee looks at the floor, hands on his hips. Nurse Irene gives his arm an awkward squeeze. Lee stares into the middle distance for a moment.
LEE
Did you see him?
GEORGE
Yeah. I mean -- No --
NURSE IRENE
GEORGE (CONT'D)
George br --
I brought him in.
GEORGE (CONT’D)
... We were lookin’ at the boat this mornin’, and he just -- I don’t know, he just, like, fell over. I thought he was kiddin’ me at first. Then I called the ambulance ... and uh -- that was it.
Lee shakes his head, still staring at the floor.
NURSE IRENE
I’ll just call Dr Muller and tell
him that you’re here.
11.
LEE
Where’s Dr Betheny?
NURSE IRENE
Oh, she’s on maternity leave. Oh
here he is.
DR MULLER, 40s, has just joined them.
DR MULLER
Lee? I’m Dr Muller. We spoke on the phone.
LEE
Yeah. Hi.
DR MULLER
I’m very, very sorry.
LEE
Thank you.
DR MULLER
Hello, George.
He shake hands with George.
GEORGE
Hiya Jim.
DR MULLER
How you holding up?
GEORGE
Oh -- Great! You know.
DR MULLER
Well... it’s a very sad day.
GEORGE
Yeah.
George starts to cry. He looks down and wipes his eyes.
LEE
Where’s my brother?
DR MULLER
He’s downstairs. You can see him if you want.
LEE
What happened?
12.
DR MULLER
Well, you know his heart was very weak at this point, and it just gave out. If it’s any comfort, I don’t think he suffered very much. I’m sorry you didn’t get here in time, but as I told you on the phone --
LEE
Aw, fuck this. (He looks at the
floor. Long pause. He looks up.)
Sorry.
DR MULLER
GEORGE
That’s perfectly all right.
That’s OK, buddy.
LEE
Did anybody call my Uncle?
DR MULLER and GEORGE glance at each other.
GEORGE
Their Uncle Donny.
LEE
GEORGE (CONT'D)
Yeah, my Aunt and Uncle.
No, Lee -- Lee, no --
Somebody shoulda called them.
What?
GEORGE (CONT’D)
-- Donny got a job in Minnesota,
like --
LEE
GEORGE (CONT'D)
Minnesota?
-- awhile ago. Yeah: He got a
job with some outfit in
Minnetonka, Minnesota, if you
can believe that. Joe didn't
tell you about that?
LEE
No.
GEORGE
I can call ‘em if you want, Lee.
And tell ‘em what happened.
LEE
OK. Thanks... 
13.
LEE (CONT’D)
GEORGE
Tell ‘em... Tell ‘em what
Oh, no problem --
happened. Tell ‘em I’ll call
‘em tonight, probably
tomorrow. Talk about
arrangements.
GEORGE (CONT’D)
Sure, I can do that.
LEE
And somebody better call my wife.
There is a confused, embarrassed hesitation.
Your... 	DR MULLER
LEE	GEORGE
Ex-wife. Yes. Sorry.	You mean Randi?
I meant Randi.	That's OK -- I already
thought of that. I'll take
care of it.
LEE
OK, thanks.
GEORGE
No problem.
LEE
Can I see him now?
DR MULLER
Sure.
GEORGE
Lee -- I can wait up here, Lee, in case you need anything.
LEE
OK.
Dr Muller leads Lee away. George breaks down again.
GEORGE
I'm sorry.
NURSE IRENE
Would you like a Kleenex?
GEORGE
Thanks. Yeah.
14.
INT. HOSPITAL ELEVATOR.
Dr Muller and Lee ride down very slowly.
LEE
How is Dr Betheny?
DR MULLER
Oh, she's doing very well. She just had twin girls.
LEE
Oh yeah. Irene told me.
DR MULLER
Apparently weigh about eleven
pounds apiece. So she's gonna have
her hands full for a while... I’ll
call her this afternoon and tell
her what happened.
LEE
She was very good to him.
DR MULLER
Yes she was.
EIGHT YEARS AGO --
INT. JOE CHANDLER’S HOSPITAL ROOM. DAY.
JOE CHANDLER is lying in the hospital bed. There’s a close resemblance between him and Lee.
ELISE, Joe’s wife, the same age as Joe, pretty, anxious and high-strung -- stands near to STANLEY CHANDLER -- Lee and Joe’s father, 70s. He sits in one chair. LEE sits in another.
They are all listening to DR BETHENY, 30s. She is small, intense, very serious and focused and level-headed, but thoroughly well-meaning and decent.
DR BETHENY
The disease is commonly referred to as congestive heart failure --
ELISE
Oh my God!
DR BETHENY
Are you familiar with it?
ELISE
No... !
15.
JOE
Then what are you sayin’ “Oh my
God” for?
ELISE
Because what is it?
JOE
She’s tryin’ to explain it to us,
honey. I’m sorry, Dr Beth... uh... 
DR BETHENY
Betheny:
JOE
DR BETHENY (CONT'D)
I’m sorry. I can never get it
Don’t worry about it. Not a
right.
problem.
STAN
So, you were saying, Dr Beth.
JOE
LEE
It’s Dr Betheny, Dad.
Dr Betheny, Daddy, try to get
it right..
ELISE
It’s a comedy routine!
JOE
STAN
Would you let her tell it?
Elise, please... 
ELISE
Oh my God: When am I gonna put one foot right?
JOE
Honey, for Christ’s sakes!
ELISE
How about a hint?
Stanley takes Elise’s hand and holds onto it.
STAN
Elise... Sweetheart... Let’s just let
her explain the situation to us... 
LEE
Daddy... 
STAN
What? She's fine. We're all upset. We're all gonna listen, then we're gonna ask everything we wanna ask, and then we’re gonna figure out what do to, together. Right?
16.
JOE
Right.
DR BETHENY
It's a gradual deterioration of the muscles of the heart. It’s usually associated with older people, but in rarer cases it will occur in a younger person. Some people can live as long as fifty or sixty years with just an occasional attack. But most people suffer periodic episodes, like the one you had on Monday, which mimic the symptoms of a heart attack and which further weaken the muscle. They can put you out of commission for a week, two weeks. And you’ll need to be hospitalized so we can monitor your heart, because the risk of cardiac arrest is elevated for a week or two.
ELISE
Oh my God.
STAN
(Pats her hand)
OK... OK... 
DR BETHENY
But in between these episodes, most people feel perfectly healthy and you can basically live a normal life.
JOE
So... What do you mean that some
people live as long as fifty or
sixty years? You mean total? Or
from when they're diagnosed with
this, or what? And tell me the
fuckin’ truth.
DR BETHENY
Total.
Everyone is stunned into silence, even Elise.
DR BETHENY (CONT’D)
For approximately eighty percent of patients your age the most common statistical life expectancy is five years or less.
Elise grips Stan’s hand. Lee looks at the floor.
17.
JOE
Wow.
DR BETHENY
But the statistics vary widely, and they’re just statistics. You’re not a statistic, you’re just one person, and we don't know what’s going to happen to you yet. But it’s not a good disease.
JOE
What’s a good disease?
DR BETHENY
Poison Ivy.
ELISE
(Rising)
I do not see where the humor lies
in this situation.
STAN
Elise, you must calm down.
JOE
DR BETHENY
Honey, please... 
I’m sorry. I’m really not
trying to --
LEE
(To Dr Betheny)
Don’t -- it’s fine.
Elise pulls her hand away from Stan and waves “No” at them.
ELISE
No. No more -- I’m not gonna --
STAN
ELISE (CONT'D)
Elise, let’s get you a glass
No m -- No.
of water --
LEE
Daddy. Forget it.
JOE (TO LEE)
Hey, shut up.
ELISE
Yeah, forget it. Forget it like you -- No, you know what? I’m tired of bein’ the bad guy here.
JOE
STAN
Jesus Christ! Who’s in the
Nobody th --
fuckin’ hospital?!
18.
ELISE
Right! So I’ll be the bad guy, and you be in the hospital and explain the jokes to your son. I’m goin’ home.
JOE
STAN
You’re goin’ home.
Sweetheart --
SHE WALKS OUT fast, her heels clicking against the floor.
STAN (CONT’D)
Lemme get her back.
LEE
Fuck her.
JOE
STAN
You wanna stop with that
Come on with that stuff
shit?
already!
THE PRESENT --
INT. HOSPITAL ELEVATOR/LOWER LEVEL HALLWAY.
The ELEVATOR DOOR OPENS AT LL2. Dr Muller and Lee come out.
INT. MORGUE.
A SECURITY GUARD opens the door for DR MULLER and LEE.
DR MULLER
Thank you, Tony.
Lee goes in and looks down at the body. Pause.
LEE
(Hesitates)
OK.
DR MULLER
Take your time.
Lee moves closer to the body. He touches Joe’s hand. It feels dead so he touches his shoulder where there’s a sleeve. He leans over and kisses his cheek. He embraces the body as best he can. Dr Muller drops back discreetly. Lee walks out past Dr Muller. Dr Muller follows.
DR MULLER (CONT’D)
(To the Security Guard)
Thanks, Tony.
19.
INT. ELEVATOR.
Lee and Dr Muller ride up again in silence.
INT. BEVERLY HOSPITAL. ICU. FLOOR. DAY -- CONTINUOUS.
The ELEVATOR DOOR OPENS. Lee and Dr Muller come out and walk to the Nurse’s Station, where IRENE and GEORGE wait.
LEE
I gotta get up to Manchester.
Nobody told Patrick, right?
DR MULLER
No -- you had asked us to wait for you to get here --
LEE
(On “us”)
Yes -- Thank you. So... What is the procedure now?
DR MULLER
Well -- You should make
arrangements with a funeral parlor,
and they pretty much take care of
everything.
LEE
I don't know the name of one.
DR MULLER
We can help you with that.
NURSE IRENE
Yeah.
LEE
And they come up and get him?
DR MULLER
Yes.
NURSE IRENE
Yes.
GEORGE
I’ll make those calls, Lee --
GEORGE (CONT’D)
LEE
Lemme know if you need any
OK. And -- OK. Thanks. And --
help with anything.
Yeah. Plus I gotta call you
about the boat, and the web
site. All that shit.
20.
GEORGE
Sure. I’m around.
LEE
OK. I better get up there before
school lets out.
DR MULLER
You just have to sign for Joe’s
belongings.
Nurse Irene takes Lee around to the nurse’s station so Lee can sign for Joe’s belongings.
SEVEN YEARS AGO --
EXT. THE SEA -- JOE’S BOAT. DAY.
Autumn. LEE, JOE and 8-YEAR-OLD PATRICK are on JOE’S BOAT. The Cape Ann coast is in the distance. The boat is rigged for whale-watching and deep sea fishing charters. Lee discreetly keeps a hand near the rod as 8-Year-Old Patrick trolls. Joe is at the tiller. He's looking thinner but better.
8-YEAR-OLD PATRICK
Like that?
LEE
Yeah, only keep your thumb off the line, ‘cause if you get a strike it's gonna slice it right open. And you know what happens then.
8-YEAR-OLD PATRICK
What?
LEE
The sharks are gonna smell that
blood and rip this boat apart.
8-YEAR-OLD PATRICK
No they won’t. Dad, will they?
JOE
Oh yeah. I seen a school of sharks tear a boat to pieces like it was made of cardboard, just ‘cause some kid threw a band-aid in the water.
8-YEAR-OLD PATRICK
No you didn’t.
21.
LEE
Sometimes the only way to keep ‘em off is to throw the kid directly in the ocean to distract ‘em.
8-YEAR-OLD PATRICK
Shut up. Sharks don’t even swim in
schools.
JOE
Is this kid smart or what?
LEE
Yep. And a really smart kid is exactly the kind of quality meal a humongous school of sharks is lookin’ for when they’re circlin’ a boat.
PATRICK
Uncle Lee! Shut up!
Patrick's REEL starts SPINNING OUT with a thrilling whine.
LEE	JOE
Strike! Strike!	Look out, look out!
Ease up on the drag --	You got a strike!
And watch that fuckin’ thumb!	Ease up, ease up!
8-YEAR-OLD PATRICK
(Hits him)
No swearing!
Patrick loses his balance. Lee catches him and props him up.
LEE
Don't hit me -- ! Catch the fish! We're doin’ fine. (To Joe) Just drive the boat.
Patty, pull up sharp! Come on, buddy! There you go! (To JOE) Mind your business!
JOE
What are you guys doin’? Hook the fish! Get the hook in him before he -- ! I’m drivin’ the goddamn boat. Get that hook in him!
Lee helps Patrick pull the rod back sharply a few times.
8-YEAR-OLD PATRICK
What kind of fish is it?
JOE
Gotta be a great white, Patty -- Maybe a barracuda --
LEE
Feels like a great white shark to me.
8-YEAR-OLD PATRICK
Shut up!
22.
Patrick is ecstatic with nerves and excitement.

SEVEN YEARS AGO --
INT. LEE’S MANCHESTER HOUSE. DAY.
Evening of the same day as the fishing scene. Lee comes into his small house and takes off his wet things. In the living room, his daughter SUZY, 7, is watching TV. A fire is crackling behind a fire screen. A radio is playing O.S.
RANDI (O.S.)
Hello?
LEE
Hi honey! (To the girl) Hi, Suzy.
Daddy’s home. (Pause) Hi, Suzy.
Daddy’s home.
SUZY
Hi Daddy.
LEE
Hi, sweetheart.
He bends down to kiss her. She hooks her arm around his neck and pulls him off balance, her eyes locked on the TV screen.
SUZY
LEE (CONT'D)
Hug.
Jesus Christ, you’re breakin’
my neck.
23.
He kisses her and she releases him.
RANDI (O.S.)
Lee?
LEE
Yeah, hiya!
INT. BEDROOM. DAY.
RANDI, Lee’s wife, 30s, is in bed with a cold. She is tough, loving and sarcastic. The room is littered with Kleenex and cold remedies and clothes. KAREN, 5, is playing with colored plastic blocks on the floor. There is a CRIB in a corner.
LEE
Hi honey.
RANDI
You have a good time?
LEE
Yeah, really good. Where’s your
mother?
RANDI
They just left.
LEE
Oh no.
RANDI
Yeah, she really missed you.
LEE
There’s always next time. Did you
sleep?
RANDI
Oh, yeah. It’s always restful when my mother’s here.
LEE
That’s too bad. Hi Kary.
KAREN
Hi Daddy.
LEE
(Picking her up)
Hello sweetheart.
KAREN
Put me down.
24.
LEE
I’m puttin’ you down. Relax.
He kisses her and starts to put her down. She wriggles and jerks unexpectedly backward. Lee almost loses his grip.
LEE (CONT’D)
RANDI
Hey, hey, hey!
Karen... !
LEE
(Putting her down)
Honey, don’t jerk around like that, I almost dropped you on your head.
KAREN
I’m making a hair salon.
LEE
Oh yeah? It’s really good. You
wanna cut my hair?
KAREN
It’s just for girls. I’m sorry.
LEE
I understand. (To Randi) How you
feelin’?
RANDI
Little better.
LEE
You sound better.
RANDI
Did you actually use the fishin’
tackle?
LEE
Yeah, we really did. Patrick got a humongous bluefish. Eighteen pounds.
RANDI
Oh yeah? That’s awesome!
LEE
I never seen anybody so happy in my life.
He crosses to her through the tissue-strewn, cluttered room.
LEE (CONT’D)
It’s nice in here. You keep it
nice. What a homemaker.
25.
RANDI
Fuck off.
He tries to kiss her. She turns her head.
RANDI (CONT’D)
Get away from me.
They kiss. She claps his hand onto her breast.
RANDI (CONT'D)
No, don't, stop, I'm sick.
They kiss some more. She shoves him away.
RANDI (CONT'D)
OK, get offa me.
Lee goes to the CRIB. Inside is STANLEY, 8 months old, awake and placid, waving his limbs at a multicolored mobile.
LEE
Hi Stanny. How come you’re not
cryin’?
RANDI
Let him alone. He’s been quiet for half an hour.
Lee picks the baby up.
LEE	RANDI (CONT'D)
Half an hour. What is that	Oh Lee, please don't pick him
about? Take it easy. (To the	up!

leave well enough alone.
LEE
“Leave well enough alone.” That’s
what me and Mummy shoulda done
instead of gettin’ married.
RANDI
(Opens her magazine)
Just shut up.
LEE
... but then you wouldn’t be here. And neither would your sisters. And I could watch the football game in my own livin’ room. That’s right, I could.
RANDI
Go fuck yourself.
26.
Lee kisses the baby and puts him back in the crib.
LEE
See? I didn’t make him cry. ‘Cause I know how to handle him.
RANDI
How was Joe?
LEE
He’s all right. You know? He’s
doin’ all right.
RANDI
And you didn’t run outta beer? You got through the day OK?
LEE
Oh yeah. We were very temperate.
RANDI
I don’t know why you guys bother
gettin’ on the friggin’ boat.
LEE
Because we love the sea.
LEE (CONT’D)
I only had eight beers over a seven hour period. That’s approximately one point four two somethin’ beers per hour.
RANDI
No, it’s almost like a normal
person stayin’ sober.
LEE
I told you I was cuttin’ down.
Lee starts to get undressed.
RANDI
What do you think you’re gonna do?
LEE
I guess I’m gonna take a shower. Randi, I swear to God. You shoulda seen the look on Patty’s face when he caught that fish. It was like takin’ Suzy on the merry-go-round. It was like -- pure happiness.
She smiles at him. Lee crawls across the bed.
27.
RANDI
Get away. I’m sick. I’m deeply
sick.
They kiss. Karen plays on the floor. The baby waves his arms.
The TV can be heard from the other room.
LEE (V.O.)
He’s not at school?
THE PRESENT --

INT./EXT. LEE’S CAR/RT 128 NORTH. DAY.
Lee drives. The SIGN for GLOUCESTER and ROCKPORT is up ahead.
INT. GLOUCESTER MIDDLE SCHOOL -- HOCKEY RINK. DAY.
The Rockport/Manchester team is having practice. PATRICK is on the ice. He is just 16, skinny, athletic, long-haired. He is bright, practical, pugnacious. The HOCKEY COACH, 40s, is shouting instructions. PATRICK checks another KID against the boards. They start fighting. They’re evenly matched but Patrick is kind of wild. The COACH yanks Patrick off the other kid.
29.
HOCKEY COACH
OK, break it up! Break it up! You!
Chandler! One more time and you are
OUT. Understand me?
Patrick sees LEE in the stands, over the coach’s shoulder..
PATRICK
Aw, fuck me.
HOCKEY COACH
What’s that, Chandler?
PATRICK
Aw, fuck my fuckin’ ass.
HOCKEY COACH
OK, you are out! You’re benched!
PATRICK
(To himself, skating away)
Ask me if I give a shit.
HOCKEY COACH
What’s that? What’s the matter?
Patrick skates over to Lee. The Coach sees Lee and hesitates. A small scrappy kid named JOEL skates up, followed by CJ, a big handsome athletic kid. These are Patrick’s friends.
JOEL
That’s his uncle.
CJ
His dad must be in the hospital.
HOCKEY COACH
Whose dad? Chandler’s?
CJ
JOEL
He’s got congestive heart
... He only comes up when Mr
failure. Patrick’s dad, I
Chandler’s in the hospital.
mean. Not Patrick.
Some other kids skate up and are watching Patrick and LEE.
HOCKEY COACH
That’s Lee Chandler? The Lee
Chandler?
CJ
Yeah, but you know that stuff about him’s bullshit, Mr Howard.
JOEL
Yeah, that story’s bullshit.
30.
HOCKEY COACH
You guys wanna watch the language?
JOEL	CJ
Sorry.	Sorry.
Across the rink, Lee is talking to Patrick. Patrick is kicking up little shards of ice with his skate. The Coach notices that all the kids have stopped to watch.
HOCKEY COACH
OK, Everybody wanna mind their own business? Five minute break. That means five!
The kids break up, marginally. The Coach skates over to Lee and Patrick. They talk briefly. The Coach puts a well-meant but sentimental hand on Patrick’s shoulder. Lee goes back up the aisle.
CJ and Joel skate over to Patrick. He tells them. They react sincerely and with sympathy. They squeeze his shoulder, they each hug him. All the kids are watching again by now.
HOCKEY COACH (CONT’D)
OK, show’s over! Let’s line it up
again! Come on, line up!
The kids start skating around, lining up at the blue line.
Patrick breaks away and skates toward the exit by himself.
INT. LEE’S CAR (MOVING). DUSK.
The winter sun is getting low. Patrick sports a semi-grunge garage-band look. Longish greasy hair, Army jacket, black T-shirt with some design on it, cargo pants maybe.
PATRICK
Oh well.
They pass a sign for MANCHESTER, BEVERLY and NORTH SALEM.
LEE
I gotta go back to the hospital and sign some papers. Do you wanna see him?
PATRICK
Him who? See who?
LEE
Your dad. Do you wanna look at him?
PATRICK
I don’t know. What does he look
like?
31.
LEE
He looks like he's dead. (Pause) I mean, he doesn't look like he's asleep, or anything like that. He doesn't look gross... (Pause) You don't have to. I wanted to see him. Maybe you don't want that image in your memory. I don't know. It's up to you.
Patrick is silent.
INT/EXT. LEE’S CAR/HOSPITAL PARKING LOT. DUSK.
Lee pulls into a parking space. He looks at Patrick, who is looking slightly queasy.
LEE
What do you think? Should I take you home? Do you want me to decide?
PATRICK
Let's just go.
At the same instant Patrick opens his door to step out and Lee starts DRIVING. He slams on the brakes.
LEE
What the fuck are you doing?
PATRICK
I just said let’s go inside!
LEE
No, you just said “Let’s just go!”
LEE (CONT’D)	PATRICK
And then you get out of the	Yeah, I meant let’s go

They get out of the car, both more subdued.
PATRICK (CONT’D)
I’m sorry, Uncle Lee.
LEE
I’m sorry too. I just got scared.
32.
INT. HOSPITAL MORGUE.
NURSE IRENE and LEE stand by while Patrick looks at Joe.
PATRICK
OK. Thank you.
NURSE IRENE
Of course... 
Patrick walks away. Lee and Dr Muller follow.
INT/EXT. LEE’S CAR (MOVING)/R 128 NORTH. DUSK/NIGHT.
They drive in silence.
PATRICK
Well, that was a mistake.
LEE
I guess I gave you bad advice.
PATRICK
No... I decided... 
EXT. THE SEA. DUSK/NIGHT.
WIDE ON THE COAST: A few headlights move through in the dark town.
EXT. MANCHESTER -- STREETS. NIGHT.
Lee’s car drives through the narrow hilly streets.
INT. LEE’S CAR. (MOVING) DUSK/NIGHT. SIMULTANEOUS.
They drive in silence. Lee slows the car to a halt. The narrow street is blocked by an SUV by a big house. A visiting family is saying goodnight to a family in front of the house.
LEE
Come on... (Pause) Come on, come on!
He HONKS the HORN LOUD, TWICE. Everybody looks at him. The CAR DAD comes around to the driver’s side of the SUV... 
CAR DAD
Sorry! Sorry! Come on, guys... !
The others continue saying goodbye and chatting. Lee HONKS the HORN several times.
LEE
Either get in the car or move it in the driveway!
33.
PATRICK
What’s the matter with you?
The Car Dad turns around. The House Dad takes a step forward.
CAR DAD
What’s your problem, pal?
LEE
Don’t tell me to relax. You're sitting in the middle of the street. (HONKS)
PATRICK
Would you stop it, Uncle Lee? It's the Galvins and the Doherties! Jesus!
LEE
Oh. It is?
PATRICK
Yes! What’s the matter with you?
LEE
I’m sorry.
PATRICK
(Waving out the window) Hiya Mr Doherty. It’s Patrick Chandler. Hi Mrs Doherty... Mr Doherty! It’s OK: It’s Patrick Chandler!
Yeah, it’s just me. Hi. Sorry about that. We’re just late. How are you?
PATRICK
Hi Mrs. Galvin. Hiya Mrs.
Doherty.
I’m OK. How are you? Sorry about that.
CAR DAD
(Squinting)
Who is that?
CAR MOM
We're leavin’, we’re leavin’! Sorry! (Kisses House Mom) I’ll call you tomorrow. (To LEE) OK, OK, OK! In the car, kids!
CAR DAD
You wanna play tough guy with me in front of all my kids?
HOUSE MOM
Goodnight kids! Come over any
time!
CAR KIDS
Goodbye! Thank you!
CAR MOM
Tommy, come on.
CAR DAD
Patrick? Is that you?
Well, for Christ’s sakes!
Where’s the fire?
HOUSE MOM
Hello, Patrick.
HOUSE DAD
Patrick? Jesus, what’s the
ruckus all about? How are
you?
CAR MOM
Oh for goodness sake... !
34.
PATRICK	LEE
It’s just my Uncle Lee. It’s	It’s Lee Chandler.
my uncle.
CAR DAD
Lee?
There is instant awkwardness between them.
LEE
Hi Tom. Sorry -- I’m sorry: I didn’t know you... 
CAR MOM
Hello, Patrick.
PATRICK
Hi, Mrs Galvin.
CAR DAD (CONT'D)
Oh. Hey, Lee... What’s all the rumpus for?
Well, keep your shirt on on... ! I’m movin’.
Lee calls to the House Dad through Patrick’s open window.
LEE	HOUSE KIDS
Hello, Jeff. Hello, Arlene.	Hi, Patrick! Hey, Patrick!
HOUSE DAD (Coldly)	PATRICK
Hey, Lee.	Hey guys. How’s it goin’?
CU: HOUSE MOM. She pointedly refuses to answer Lee at all.
LEE
... Sorry about the ruckus.
HOUSE MOM
Patrick, how’s your dad?
PATRICK
He’s fine.
EXT. JOE’S HOUSE. NIGHT.
The car stops in front of the GARAGE of a small well-kept old clapboard house with lots of bare trees and shrubs around.
PATRICK
You gotta hit the bleeper.
LEE
I don’t have the bleeper.
PATRICK
I’ll do it. There’s a code.
Patrick gets out and goes to open the garage door manually.
35.
INT. JOE’S HOUSE. NIGHT.
Lee and Patrick come in and turn on the lights. The house is just as it was that morning. The Boston Globe sports section is spread on the sofa. One of Joe’s plaid shirts is draped over the back of the chair.
PATRICK
Is it OK if some of my friends come over? I told ‘em I would call ‘em.
LEE
Go ahead.
PATRICK
Can we get some pizza? There’s
nothing to eat here.
LEE
Yeah. Sure. (Takes out his iPhone)
What kind do you want?
PATRICK
Any kind is fine. Thank you.
Lee takes out his phone. Patrick starts to text his friends.
INT. JOE’S HOUSE -- LIVING ROOM. NIGHT.
Patrick, Joel and CJ and SILVIE, who seems to be Patrick’s girlfriend, are all sitting around in the living room. They are a bit awkward but well-meaning -- except Silvie, who is over-relaxed and too touchy-feely with Patrick.
SILVIE
At least he didn’t suffer. It’s
worse for the family, but it’s
better for the person.
CJ
Well, he was a fuckin’ great guy,
Patrick, I’ll tell you that.
JOEL
That’s for sure.
CJ
I remember one time he took us all out in the boat? Like in sixth grade?
36.
JOEL	CJ (CONT'D)
I remember that.	And he made us wear life
preservers? And I was like,
“What’s the difference, Mr
I remember. And he says --	Chandler? Boat sinks in this
weather we’re dead anyway.”
And he says “The life
jacket’s to make it easier on
the sharks when you go over.”
The boys laugh.
PATRICK
Yeah, he really liked those shark
jokes.
JOEL
He was funny, boy.
SILVIE
Yeah, but he was gentle too, you know? (Strokes Patrick’s hair) Like his son.
This piece of sentimentality embarrasses everyone but Silvie.
INT. JOE’S KITCHEN. SIMULTANEOUS.
Lee is at the table, halfway through a piece of pizza and a beer. He finishes the beer, gets another and heads into --
INT. JOE’S LIVING ROOM. CONTINUOUS.
Lee moves through the room toward the staircase.
CJ	JOEL
And there’s this former	Star Trek sucks.
starship captain -- this	Star Trek sucks my ass.
former starship captain, shut
up --
SILVIE	CJ
How you doin’, baby?	Star Trek is one of the
PATRICK	pillars of modern
entertainment.
OK.	JOEL
One of the pillars of modern
entertainment is retarded.
CJ (CONT'D)	JOEL
No it’s not! Ask Patrick! Ask	Read my lips. Star Trek is

37.
SILVIE
I can’t believe we’re talking about
Star Trek right now!!
This effectively kills the conversation. She goes back to stroking his hair. LEE keeps going up the stairs.
PATRICK
I like Star Trek... 
INT. JOE’S ROOM. NIGHT.
Lee snaps on the lights and comes in. The room is tidy except for a few items: A coffee mug, an open book on the floor by the bed. Lee opens the bottom dresser drawer and takes out a pair of Joe’s neatly folded pajamas.
