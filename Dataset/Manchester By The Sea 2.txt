INT. GUEST/LEE’S ROOM. NIGHT.
Lee lies on top of the bed, wearing Joe’s pajamas, drinking beer and watching television. Patrick knocks and comes in.
PATRICK
Hey, Uncle Lee? Is it OK if Silvie sleeps over? Dad always let her.
LEE
Then what are you asking me for?
PATRICK
No reason. Thanks.(Pause) So -- Not that it would come up, but her parents think she stays downstairs when she stays over? So if it comes up for some reason, can you just say she stayed in the downstairs room?
LEE
I don’t even know them.
PATRICK
Yes you do. It’s the McGanns. Frank and Pat McGann.
LEE
That’s Silvie McGann?
PATRICK
Yeah. So do you mind sayin’ she
stayed downstairs? Like if they
call or something?
LEE
OK.
38.
Patrick hesitates.
LEE (CONT'D)
Am I supposed to tell you to use a condom?
PATRICK
No... I mean -- Unless you really
feel like it.
LEE
Is that what Joe would say?
PATRICK
No. I mean, yes. I mean, we’ve had “The Discussion” and everything.
LEE
OK.
PATRICK
Just lemme know if we’re makin’ too much noise.
LEE
OK.
PATRICK
Hey. Do you think I should call my mom? To tell her about Dad?
LEE
(Tenses)
I wouldn’t, Patty. I don’t think anybody even knows where she is... 
PATRICK
All right. I was just curious what you thought. Anyway... Good night, Uncle Lee.
LEE
Good night.
Patrick surprises Lee by going to him and giving him an awkward hug. Patrick heads for the door.
INT. GUEST/LEE’S ROOM. NIGHT.
Lee lies on the bed.
SIX YEARS AGO --
39.
INT. JOE & ELISE’S HOUSE. SUMMER -- DUSK.
The room is DARK except for the TV. Two little DOGS start BARKING. JOE, 9-YEAR-OLD PATRICK and LEE come in the house. They are muddy and dusty from playing softball. They drop the softball gear, start taking off their muddy sneakers, etc.
JOE
--	and now you’re gonna sulk all night because you dropped the goddamn ball?
9-YEAR-OLD PATRICK	LEE (To JOE)
I’m not sulking.	Why don’t you stop already?
JOE (To Lee)	You wanna stop?
Shut up! (To Patrick) If you	Why don’t you kill him?

Shaddup, shaddUP, you stupid
I don't need a baseball mitt.
dogs! ELISE!	I catch better without one!
Joe flicks on the LIGHTS. The small living room is trashed.
JOE
Ah, shit.
9-YEAR-OLD PATRICK
Dad! No cursing!
ELISE is PASSED OUT on the SOFA, her short nightie scrunched up underneath her. She's got no underwear on, so the men and 9-Year-Old Patrick can see everything. There's a half-empty bottle and a glass of liquor on the coffee table. Cigarette butts spill over the ashtray. Joe takes immediate control.
JOE
Lee, you wanna take Patty upstairs and get him washed up? Go on up, Patty. Everything’s OK.
LEE
Come on, buddy.
POV LEE as he takes Patrick upstairs: Joe pulls down Elise’s nightie. Looks at his shoe. There’s a little dog shit on it.
JOE
Oh, come on.
POV LEE as Joe sees that the dogs have peed and crapped all over the floor -- a whole day’s worth.
THE PRESENT --
40.
INT. GUEST/LEE’S ROOM. NIGHT.
Lee is lying in bed. He switches off the light. We can hear the ocean outside.
INT. PATRICK’S ROOM. SIMULTANEOUS.
SILVIE is asleep on Patrick’s single bed. PATRICK is at his desk typing on his laptop. We see what he is TYPING:
“Dear Mom --”
EXT. JOE’S HOUSE. DAY.
A clear cold day. The house has a nice view of the town.
INT. KITCHEN. DAY.
Lee is dressed and seated at the table with a cup of coffee, talking on his iPhone.
LEE
(On the phone)
Beverly, Massachusetts ... 
Gallagher Funeral Home please ... 
SILVIE comes through the kitchen door, dressed, very comfortable in the house.
SILVIE
Morning.
LEE
Hello.
Over the following she gets some juice and yogurt out of the fridge, some herbal tea, and puts on the kettle, while Lee watches her. Patrick enters, gets some cold cereal.
LATER -- They are all at the table. Lee is still on the phone.
PATRICK
Pass the milk please.
LEE
So but, I don't know what I gotta
do to get his body from the
hospital to your place, but they
said ...  Oh, OK... 
41.
SILVIE
Excuse me, Mr Chandler? I don’t think Patrick needs to be here for this.
PATRICK
That’s all right.
Lee gets up and goes out. Silvie puts a hand on Patrick’s hand. We can hear LEE’S VOICE from the other room.
LEE (O.S.)
So why is it more to drive his body to Manchester? ‘Cause you gotta take the highway for seven minutes? What do you charge if the hearse takes 127?
SILVIE
Jesus. Like that’s his focus?
PATRICK
He’s alright.
EXT. MANCHESTER ESSEX REGIONAL HIGH SCHOOL -- HALL. DAY.
Lee’s car stops in front of the school gate. Patrick and Silvie climb out from the back.
PATRICK
SILVIE
Thanks, Uncle Lee.
Thanks a lot, Mr Chandler.
He watches them walk toward the school, joining a general swarm of kids funneling to the school entrance.
INT. SCHOOL. DAY.
Patrick walks thru the halls. Various kids greet him with expressions of sympathy.
KID’S VOICE
Hey, Patrick. Sorry to hear about
your dad, man.
PATRICK
Oh -- Thanks, man. Thank you.
He presses thru. Other kids stop him with condolences.
INT. ATHLETIC DEPARTMENT OFFICE. DAY.
HOCKEY COACH Mr. Howard is seated. Patrick stands.
42.
HOCKEY COACH
We’re gonna forget about the
language. We’re gonna forget about
the fists. But I want you to take a
few days offa practice. I don’t
want you on the ice. You got enough
on your mind.
PATRICK
That’s OK, Mr Howard. To tell you
the truth, I could use the
distraction --
HOCKEY COACH
The ice is not a distraction. When you’re on the ice, you gotta be there. Take the week and we’ll talk. And listen: I lost my dad right about your age. So I know what you’re goin’ through. So if you wanna come in and talk, or you just want somebody to spill your guts to -- or you just wanna throw the bull around, door’s open.
INT./EXT. LEE’S CAR/MANCHESTER ESSEX HIGH SCHOOL. DAY.
Lee picks Patrick up from school and they drive away.
INT. LEE’S CAR (MOVING) DAY.
They drive through town.
PATRICK
You mind if I put some music on?
LEE
No.
Patrick turns the radio to some pop-rock station.
PATRICK
You like these guys? The lead
guitar is weak but otherwise
they’re pretty good.
LEE
They all sound the same to me.
PATRICK
Where we going?
LEE
To see the lawyer.
43.
PATRICK
What for?
LEE
We gotta read your father’s will.
PATRICK
Can’t you just drop me at home and tell me what it says in it?
LEE
Well, yeah -- except we’re there.
They are approaching the Manchester’s tiny business district.
EXT. STREET -- LAWYER’S OFFICE. DAY.
They walk toward the little two story office building.
PATRICK
Who do you think he left the boat
to?
LEE
I’m sure he left you everything.
As they go up the OUTDOOR STAIRWAY to the 2nd story office,
We hear the SOUND of a PING-PONG game: Ka-POP, ka-POP, plus
other growing sounds of voices and music. They take us to --
FIVE YEARS AGO --
INT. LEE & RANDI’S HOUSE -- BASEMENT DEN. NIGHT.
LEE is playing PING-PONG with TOM DOHERTY -- the CAR DAD. A bunch of his friends are drinking and making noise. Loud music. We spot JOE and GEORGE. Lee SLAMS the BALL.
LEE
Eat my fuckin’ forehand, Tommy!
TOM
LEE (CONT'D)
Once! That was once! He punts
I got it workin’ now. Just
the ball sixteen times and
keep away from this quadrant
now he’s Superman.
and you won’t go home in
tears.
RANDI appears at the top of the basement stairs in a bathrobe. Everybody looks up at her, like little boys.
RANDI
Would you keep it down, you fuckin’ morons? My kids are sleepin’.
44.
LEE
I’m sorry, honey. (To the guys) I
told you guys to keep it down.
RANDI
THE GUYS
Lee, you wanna get these
Yeah, Sorry, Ran/ I told you

Randi leaves.
LEE
She can’t talk that way to us.
TOM
Yeah. We’re not pinheads.
EVERYBODY LAUGHS. Randi immediately appears again, furious.
RANDI
Hey! I’m not fuckin’ around! It’s two o’clock in the fuckin’ mornin’! Get these fuckin’ assholes dressed and get ‘em the fuck outta here.
THE PRESENT --
INT. LAWYER’S OFFICE -- WAITING ROOM. DAY.
Patrick sits, texting. An ASSISTANT types at her computer.
INT. LAWYER’S OFFICE. DAY -- SIMULTANEOUSLY.
WES, 40s, sits behind his desk across from LEE. Each holds a copy of Joe’s will.
LEE
I don’t understand.
WES
What -- part are you having trouble with... ?
LEE (On “trouble”)
I can’t be Patrick’s guardian.
WES
I understand it’s a serious
responsibility --
LEE
No -- I mean -- I mean, I can’t --
45.
WES
Well -- Naturally I assumed that
Joe had discussed this with you --
LEE
No. He didn’t. No.
WES
Well... I must say I’m somewhat
taken aback --
LEE
He can’t live with me:
LEE (CONT’D)
WES
I live in one room.
But if you look -- Now, well,
if you look, you’ll see Joe
provided for Patrick’s
upkeep: Clothes, food, et
cetera... The house and boat
are owned outright... 
LEE
I don’t see how I could be his
guardian.
WES
Well, those were your brother’s
wishes.
LEE
Yeah but I can’t commute from
Boston every day until he turns
eighteen.
WES
I think the idea was that you would relocate.
LEE
WES (CONT'D)
Relocate? Where? Here?
If you look at --
WES (CONT’D)
Well, yes. As you can see, your
brother worked everything out
extremely carefully.
46.
LEE
WES (CONT'D)
But -- He can’t have meant
And if you -- Well, you can
that.
see he’s allowed up to five
thousand dollars to help you
with the move. There's a
small amount set aside for
you to draw from, as personal
income while you settle in --
assuming of course that you
accept... 
LEE
What about Uncle Donny and Teresa?
WES
Well, they did come up. But Joe
didn’t feel that Patrick really had
any special relationship or feeling
about them --
LEE	WES (CONT'D)
I don't understand.	And now, I think you know
Minnesota.	they've moved out to
Wisconsin, I believe..
Minnetonka, Minnesota.	Minnesota, that's right.
So... 
Wes watches as Lee flips through the 3-page will as if there's something he may have missed. After a moment:
WES (CONT'D)
It was my impression you’ve spent a lot of time here over the years... 
LEE
Just as backup. I came up to stay with Patty whenever Joe was in the hospital, after my dad couldn’t do it. We -- It was supposed to be my Uncle Donny. I was just the backup.
WES
Well... I can only repeat, I’m
astonished that Joe never ran all
this by you, thorough as he was.
LEE
Yeah, because he knew what I would say if he would have asked.
FIVE YEARS AGO (CONT’D)--
Lee stands outside waving and shouting goodbyes to the CARS DRIVING AWAY. His friends respond with car horns and apologies. Randi stands inside, wrapped in a bathrobe.
LEE (CONT’D)
See Jupiter? Good night! Keep your eyes on the road! You see Jupiter? Keep your eyes on the road! Good night Tommy! Good night Joe! Sorry again! (To the Guys) See the North Star? There's the North Star, right there!
TOM (O.C)
Where?
47.
THE GUYS
Good night, Lee! Tell Randi we’re sorry! We’re so sorry! Good night, etc.
LEE
It’s due north... !
A MOMENT LATER -- Lee shuts the front door, shivering in his shirt sleeves. He tries to kiss Randi. She turns her head.
LEE (CONT’D)
I’ll clean up in the morning, baby.
RANDI
You see Jupiter you fucking
asshole?
He laughs.
LEE
Come on... 
She lets him kiss her, then she goes off toward their bedroom. Lee shivers and rubs his arms.
INT. LAWYER’S OFFICE. DAY -- SIMULTANEOUS.
Lee is still staring at the will.
WES
Lee... 
FIVE YEARS AGO (CONT’D) --
EXT. MANCHESTER STREET -- MINI-MART. NIGHT.
Cheerfully drunk, LEE walks along the crunchy snow-covered sidewalk and into a mini-mart. It’s a very cold clear night.
THE PRESENT --
48.
INT. LAWYER’S WAITING ROOM. DAY.
Patrick is still texting away in the armchair.
WES’S ASSISTANT
Patrick? Can I get you a soda or
anything?
PATRICK
No thank you.
FIVE YEARS AGO (CONT’D) --
EXT. MINI-MART. NIGHT.
THROUGH THE WINDOW we see the clerk bag two six-packs, milk, and some Pampers for LEE. Lee comes out of the store. He has some drunken trouble zipping his parka as he heads home. He doesn’t notice the orange-red GLOW in the sky ahead.
THE PRESENT --
INT. LAWYER’S OFFICE. DAY.
WES
Lee... Nobody can appreciate what you’ve been through... If I can say that. And if you really don’t feel you can take this on, that’s your right, obviously --
LEE
But who would get him?
WES
The probate court would appoint a
guardian in your place.
LEE
Like who?
LEE (CONT’D)
WES
My Uncle Donny?
I don’t know -- No -- Not
necessarily. Especially, now
with the distance.
LEE
Who else would there be?
WES
Well... I don’t know what’s happening with Patrick’s mother --
49.
LEE
WES (CONT'D)
No. No.
I’m not sure where she is, or
what her condition is -- But
you can bet the judge would
certainly look into it.
LEE
... No... Can’t do that.
FIVE YEARS AGO (CONT’D) --
EXT. LEE’S STREET. NIGHT.
Lee slows as he nears the turn to his street. He is looking at the FIERY SKY and FLASHING LIGHTS. He starts to run --
THE PRESENT --
INT. LAWYER’S OFFICE. DAY.
Lee sits staring out Wes’ window at the harbor.
WES
There is Patrick to be considered.
FIVE YEARS AGO (CONT’D) --
EXT. LEE & RANDI’S HOUSE. NIGHT.
The little HOUSE is COMPLETELY ON FIRE. Fire trucks and FIREMEN are pumping water into the blinding SMOKE. There is also an ambulance and police cars. TWO POLICEMEN are trying to control RANDI. She’s in a nightgown smeared with smoke and water. She thrashes violently to shake them off so she can run into the flaming house. She is completely hysterical.
RANDI
Let me go! Get your hands off me!
Let go of me! Somebody go in there!
Let me go! Get them outta there!
We PAN the faces of a clutch of neighbors looking on, mortified, until we land on LEE staring at the blazing house. He still holds the paper bag from the mini-mart.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. LEE’S HOUSE. DAWN.
The sky is getting light. The fire is out. The smoking house is burnt to nothing. The neighbors have been pushed back by the police and firemen.
50.
Two EMS workers are putting Randi into the ambulance. She's on a stretcher and wears an oxygen mask. She is half conscious.
TWO POLICEMEN are questioning LEE. He’s still holding the grocery bag. JOE is standing next to him now hastily stuffed into his winter coat. He grips Lee’s arm with a gloved hand.
The ambulance with Randi in it drives away. LEE looks past the policemen as EMS WORKERS approach the next ambulance. They are bringing and loading THREE COVERED STRETCHERS bearing THREE LITTLE BODIES into the ambulance as Lee watches. In the last stretcher the smoke-blackened ELBOW of a LITTLE GIRL sticks out a little from under the blanket. An EMS Worker quickly pushes it under again.
They put the stretchers in the ambulance and shut the doors. Without moving Lee starts crying hopelessly. The two cops stop trying to talk to him. Joe holds Lee’s arm throughout.
THE PRESENT --
INT. LAWYER’S OFFICE. DAY.
Lee looks from the will to the view out the window.
WES
LEE
Look -- Lee --
Thanks, Wes. I’ll, uh, I’ll
be in touch.
Lee gets up abruptly and heads for the door.
FIVE YEARS AGO (CONT’D) --
EXT. MACHESTER POLICE STATION. DAY.
PUSH IN ON a weatherbeaten old building backed by the marina.
INT. MANCHESTER POLICE STATION -- MAIN OFFICE. DAY.
JOE and STAN wait for Lee at one end of the office with a few desks and six or seven police officers going about their business.
INT. POLICE STATION -- INTERVIEW ROOM. DAY.
SLOW PUSH IN ON LEE at a table, facing a POLICE DETECTIVE, a UNIFORMED POLICEMAN, and the STATE FIRE MARSHALL.
LEE
You know. We were partyin’ pretty
hard.
(MORE)
51.
LEE (CONT'D)
Beer, and somebody was passin’
around a joint. Somebody else had
some cocaine.
1ST DETECTIVE
Cocaine?
LEE
Yes.
1ST DETECTIVE
OK. Go on.
LEE
Anyway, our bedroom’s in the downstairs. The girls sleep upstairs. So Randi makes everybody leave around two o’clock, maybe three AM, and she went back to bed. So everybody leaves, and I go inside. And it’s really cold inside, so I go check on the girls, and it’s fuckin’ freezing up there. We sleep downstairs. The girls sleep in the upstairs. But Randi doesn’t like the central heat because it dries her out her sinuses, and she gets these headaches. So I went downstairs and built a fire in the fireplace, and I sit down to watch TV, except there’s no more beer. And I’m still jumpin’ like a jackrabbit. So I put a couple big logs on the fire so the house would warm up when I was gone, and I went to the mini-mart... It’s about a fifteen minute walk both ways. But I didn’t wanna drive cause I was really wasted. And I’m halfway there, and I remember I didn’t put the screen back on the fireplace. But I figure it’s probably OK. So I kept going to the store. And that’s it. One of the logs musta rolled out on the floor when I was gone. The girls were all upstairs...  And that’s it. The firemen got Randi out. She was passed out downstairs. And then they said the furnace blew, and they couldn’t go inside again. And that’s all I remember.
Pause.
52.
1ST DETECTIVE
OK, Lee. That’s all for now. We’ll
call you if anything else comes up
we want to ask you about.
FIRE MARSHALL
Assumin’ the forensics bear you
out... which I’m assumin’ that they
will... 
LEE
What do you mean? That’s it?
FIRE MARSHALL
Look, Lee: You made a horrible
mistake. Like a million other
people did last night. But we don’t
wanna crucify you. It’s not a crime
to leave the screen off the
fireplace.
LEE
So... What? I can go?
FIRE MARSHALL
Unless somethin’ else comes up that we don’t know about already, yeah.
1ST DETECTIVE
You got a ride back home?
LEE
Yeah.
90	INT. POLICE STATION -- MAIN ROOM. DAY -- CONTINUOUS.	90
Lee comes out of a room opposite, followed by the Detective and Fire Marshall. He makes his way past the desks. Suddenly he GRABS a YOUNG COP from behind, pulls the GUN out of his holster and shoves him away. SHOUTS and GUNS come out everywhere. LEE puts the GUN to his own HEAD and pulls the trigger, but the SAFETY CATCH is ON. JOE is across the room in a bound.
JOE
Don’t shoot! Don’t shoot!
LEE fumbles with the safety catch -- TWO COPS take him DOWN and grab the gun. He doesn't resist at all. JOE joins the fray. STAN staggers and reaches for the wall behind him.
THE PRESENT --
INT. LAWYER’S WAITING ROOM. DAY.
LEE comes out of the lawyer’s office. Patrick gets up.
53.
LEE
Alright. Let’s go.
PATRICK
Where to, the orphanage?
LEE
Shut up.
PATRICK
What the hell did I do?
LEE
Just be quiet.
Lee heads for the exit. Patrick follows him out.
EXT. OFFICE BUILDING. DAY.
Lee and Patrick come out of the building, Lee first. They walk to the car. He digs out his keys.
LEE
All right. We got a lot to do.
PATRICK
What about the boat?
LEE
We gotta talk to George about it. There’s no point hangin’ onto it if no one’s gonna use it --
PATRICK
I’m gonna use it.

PATRICK
I can’t obey your orders until you unlock the door.
LEE
Just shut up.
EXT. MANCHESTER -- MARINA. DAY -- PRESENT.
Lee and Patrick walk along the marina.
EXT/INT. MARINA -- JOE’S BOAT. DAY.
Lee and Patrick and GEORGE are looking at JOE’S BOAT. Lee and Patrick are not dressed warmly enough.
GEORGE
It’s not like the motor’s gonna die tomorrow, but Joe said it’s been breakin’ down like a son of a bitch.
PATRICK
LEE

GEORGE (CONT'D)
I’m takin’ care of it.
But that motor’s gonna go at
some point... 
56.
LEE
There’s no allotment for a new
motor. Unless you wanna buy it,
George... 
PATRICK
Wait a second. I’m not sellin’ it --
LEE
Anyway, we’re gonna be in Boston.
PATRICK

57.
EXT. MARINA/WHARF. DAY.
Lee and Patrick walk back along the wharf toward the street and the car.
PATRICK
Are you brain-damaged? You can't just ask people that... ! You don't wanna be my guardian, that's fine with me.
LEE
It's not that. It's just the
logistics. I just gotta work it
out. I swear.
PATRICK
How? By sendin’ me to Wonkatonka
Minnesota with Uncle Donny?
LEE
Minnetonka!
PATRICK
LEE (CONT'D)
OK, Minnetonka. Minnetonka
Minnetonka Minnesota. Not
Minnesota. Same difference!
Wonkatonka Minnesota.
PATRICK
What about my mother?
Lee stops walking, then starts again.
LEE
The judge wouldn't let her. Anyway, no one knows where she is.
PATRICK
I do. She's in Connecticut. At
least she was last year.
Lee stops walking again.
LEE
Since when do you know that?
PATRICK
She emailed me last year. So I emailed her back. You know, email?
LEE
Did your father know you were in
touch with her?
PATRICK
Are you kiddin’? (Pause) Could we
walk? I'm freezin’.
58.
They start walking again.
LEE
All I can tell you is --
PATRICK
I know, I know, she's a drunk, she's insane, she let the dogs shit on the floor.
LEE
--	it’s the last thing your dad ever woulda wanted.
PATRICK
Oh, like you suddenly care what he woulda wanted?
LEE
Aw, fuck everything.
INT./EXT. LEE’S CAR(MOVING) NEAR THE MARINA. DAY.
Lee and Patrick are driving away from the marina.
PATRICK

Patrick notices they are now heading out of town.
PATRICK
Whoa, whoa, where’re we goin’?
LEE
It’s in Beverly.
PATRICK
There’s no funeral homes in
Manchester?
LEE
No. (Pause) The cemetery's here... 
PATRICK
Well, can you let me out? I'll just walk home.
59.
LEE
Let’s just get this done.

You wanna warn me if there's any
other Surprise Death Errands we

LEE
Yes. Sorry. This is it.
EXT. BEVERLY. DAY.
They drive through Beverly, a big coastal town of 40,000.
INT. GALLAGHER’S FUNERAL HOME. DUSK.
Patrick looks around while Lee talks to the Funeral Director.
EXT. GALLAGHER’S FUNERAL HOME. DUSK.
Lee and Patrick walk away. The wind is punishing.
PATRICK
What is with that guy and the big
Serious and Somber Act?
LEE
I don't know.
PATRICK
But seriously, does he not realize that people know he does this every single day?
LEE
I don't know. Who cares? (Stops) I think I parked the other way. Sorry.
They reverse direction and start walking into the wind.
PATRICK
Why can't we bury him?
LEE
It's too cold. The ground’s too
hard. They’ll bury him in the
spring.
PATRICK
So what do they do with him til
then?
60.
LEE
They put him in a freezer.
PATRICK
Are you serious?
LEE
Yeah. That's what they do with them. They put ‘em in a big freezer until the ground thaws out.
PATRICK
That really freaks me out.
LEE
It doesn’t matter. It isn't him. It's just his body. Where’d I park the car?
PATRICK
What about one of those mini-steam shovels?
LEE
What?
PATRICK
I once saw one of those mini-steam shovels one time in a graveyard in New Haven. It dug a perfect little hole in about two seconds.
LEE
I don’t... really know how you would get ahold of one. Or how much it would cost --
PATRICK
Why can't we just look into it?
LEE
Anyway, I’m pretty sure you can’t use heavy equipment in the Historic Rosedale Cemetery.
PATRICK
Why not?
LEE
Because there’s a lot of important people buried there, and their descendants don’t want a steam shovel vibratin’ over their dead bodies. How do I know?
61.
PATRICK
Why can't we bury him someplace
else?
LEE
That’s where he bought a plot. Don’t ask me why. But if you wanna find someplace else to bury him, and find out how much it costs, and change all the arrangements with the mortician and the cemetery, and call up Sacred Heart and talk to Father Martin, and change the arrangements for the funeral service, be my guest. Otherwise let's just leave it. OK?
They turn onto a SIDE STREET. The wind picks up brutally.
PATRICK
I just don't like him bein’ in a
freezer.
LEE
Oh come on! Where’s the goddamn
car?
PATRICK
I don’t know, but I wish you’d figure it out because I’m freezin’ my ass off.
LEE
Don’t you have a normal winter
coat?
PATRICK
LEE (CONT'D)
Yes.
Why don’t you have gloves
with fingers on them?
Another gust of wind blows right through them.
PATRICK
LEE (CONT'D)
Jesus Christ!
God damn it!
LEE (CONT’D)
Oh where the fuck did I park the
fucking car?
EXT./INT. BEVERLY STREET/LEE’S CAR. DUSK.
They see the car on a long sloping street and run to it. They get in and slam the doors. Lee turns on the engine.
LEE
God damn it’s cold!
62.
PATRICK
Why? What’s the matter with your
winter jacket?
LEE	PATRICK (CONT'D)
Seriously, Patty --?	Just turn the heat on!
It's on already!	Well turn it up a little!

horse that goes with this
fuckin’ car? Maybe he could
breathe on us.
LEE
Patty, I swear to God --
PATRICK
I know. Why don’t we just keep my
dad in here for the next three
months? We could save a fuckin’
fortune.
LEE
Would you shut up about that freezer please? You want me to have a nervous breakdown because there's undertakers and a funeral?
LEE (CONT’D)
PATRICK
-- Who cares?
No... I don’t!
Lee holds his hand over the vent.
LEE
‘K, it’s gettin’ warmer.
PATRICK
I got band practice. Can you drive me home so I can get my stuff and then take me over to my girlfriend’s house?
LEE
Sure.
EXT. MANCHESTER. SANDY’S HOUSE. DUSK.
Lee pulls up in front of a small ranch house with a big front yard. Patrick twists around to gets his stuff from the back.
63.
LEE
This is the same girl as who was
over at the house?
PATRICK
No. That was Silvie. This is Sandy. But they don't know about each other. So please don't say anything in case it comes up.
LEE
I won’t. (Pause) Do you actually
have sex with these girls?
PATRICK
We don't just play computer games.
LEE
With both of them?
PATRICK
Well with Sandy's mom here it's
sort of strictly just basement
business.
LEE
What does that mean?
PATRICK
It means I'm workin' on it.
Patrick grabs his electric guitar and mini-amp from the back seat. Lee watches him run across the lawn to the house.
INT. JOE’S HOUSE. NIGHT.
Lee comes in and snaps on the lights.
INT. KITCHEN. NIGHT.
Lee puts a slice of cold pizza in the microwave.
INT. SANDY’S HOUSE -- BASEMENT. NIGHT.
PATRICK’S ROCK BAND is practicing in the basement. SANDY, 17, brighter, wilder and more original than Silvie, sings lead vocals. PATRICK plays rhythm guitar, CJ plays lead, JOEL plays bass, a kid named OTTO plays drums. The boys sing backup. The name on the big drum is “STENTORIAN.” They are playing an original composition.
64.
SANDY
(Singing)
“I gotta RUN! I gotta RUN, I, I, I, I, I, I, I gotta run --”
THE WHOLE BAND
“-- I gotta run, I gotta run, I
gotta run.”
PATRICK
Stop. Stop. Otto man, what are you doing?
OTTO
What did I do?
PATRICK
You're way behind, man.
OTTO
No, I'm not.
JOEL	CJ
You're a little behind, Otto.	Otto, you’re kind of draggin’ it... 
PATRICK
You gotta stay with the bass.
JOEL
Come on man, just stay with me, all right?
OTTO
All right, I'm sorry.
CJ
It's all right! You're alright. Let’s just take it again. Otto, you good?
OTTO
Yeah.
They get ready to take it again. Patrick leans into his microphone.
PATRICK
We are Stentorian.
They start playing again.
65.
EXT. SANDY’S HOUSE. NIGHT.
Lee’s car pulls up to the curb. Stentorian thuds through the frozen earth. Sandy’s mom, JILL, comes out and crosses the lawn. She is 40, pretty and pleasant, hair in a pony tail. Lee rolls down the window.
JILL
Hi, are you Lee? I'm Jill. Sandy’s mom. I think they’re wrapping up. Do you wanna come inside and have a beer or something?
LEE
Oh, that’s all right. Thank you.
JILL
I wanted to offer my condolences about Joe. He was such a terrific guy. There's not too many like him. He was a wonderful father.
LEE
Thank you.
JILL
I was -- I was gonna ask Patrick if he wants to stay for supper, if that's OK with you. You wanna join us? I made way too much... 
LEE
Oh. That’s all right. Thank you.
What time should I come back?
JILL
Oh -- I don’t know. Nine? Nine-
thirty? They’re gonna do their
homework together. Supposedly. Ha
ha ha.
LEE
OK. I’ll come back at nine-thirty.
JILL
OK. You change your mind in the
next ten minutes, we’re right
inside.
LEE
OK. Thank you.
Jill hesitates, smiles, then runs back to the house. Lee drives off.
66.
INT. SANDY’S ROOM. NIGHT.
Patrick and Sandy are making out on her bed. Patrick’s hand is halfway down the front of Sandy’s complicated jeans.
SANDY
PATRICK
Hold on -- Hold on.

the skin off my knuckles. How
do you unbuckle this?
SANDY
Would you please take your hand
outta my cunt?
PATRICK
OK, OK! (Withdraws his hand) Ow!
Sandy wriggles out of her jeans.
PATRICK (CONT’D)
Oh, are we taking our pants off?
SANDY
I'm takin' my pants off. I don't
know what you're doing.
PATRICK
I'm takin' my pants off... 
Patrick tries to take off his pants, but one leg bunches up at his ankle. He kicks to get it off. She tries to help him.
SANDY
Come on! You gotta take your shoe
off... !
PATRICK
I’m tryin’!
O.C., Jill KNOCKS on the DOOR. The kids both scramble away from each other and frantically start to dress.
JILL (O.C.)
Hey kids? Come on have some dinner!
PATRICK	SANDY
OK, thanks Jill! We'll be	Thanks, Mom! We’ll be right
down in just one second.	down!
I just gotta log off... !	Would you shut up? She’s not

SANDY
I'm not pickin’ on you! You're
going to get me in trouble.
INT. JILL’S HOUSE -- LIVING ROOM. NIGHT.
Jill waits near the stairs. Patrick and Sandy come down.

INT. JILL’S DINING AREA. NIGHT.
Jill, Sandy and Patrick eat spaghetti.
PATRICK
Mm. This is really delicious, Jill.
JILL
Thank you, Patrick.
SANDY
Yeah, Mom, really good.
PATRICK
Is this a homemade carbonara sauce?
SANDY
Jesus, shut up.
JILL
Oh -- no... 
PATRICK
You could’ve fooled me.
SANDY
Jesus.
PATRICK
What?
SANDY
You're such a kiss-ass!
68.
JILL
Sandy!
PATRICK
Why? Because I appreciate your
mother's cookin'?

happened.
INT. JOE’S LIVING ROOM. NIGHT.
Lee is on the sofa with his iPhone and a beer, watching a Celtics game. A PHONE RINGS. He looks around, confused. Looks at his cell. Finally he realizes Joe’s LAND LINE is ringing.
LEE
(Answering)
Hello?
RANDI
(Over the phone)
Hello... Lee? It’s Randi. (Pause)
Hello? Lee?
Pause.
LEE
Yeah. I’m here. Sorry. How are you?
RANDI
I’m OK. How are you?
LEE
Good.
RANDI
I was callin’ -- George told me about Joe. I just wanted to call and say I’m sorry. I hope you don’t mind me callin’.
LEE
No. Thank you. I don’t mind... How
are you?
69.
RANDI
Not so good, right now. I guess we shoulda seen it comin’, but... it’s still kinda hard to believe... 
LEE
Yeah... 
RANDI
How’s Patrick doin’? Beyond the
obvious, obviously... 
LEE
He’s OK. It’s hard to tell with
kids.
RANDI	LEE (CONT'D)
Yeah --	He doesn’t really open up
with me. I think he’s OK.
Well, that’s good.	He’s got a lotta
friends... So... Yeah, it is... 
RANDI
So, I don't know if you planned a service yet, but I was also gonna ask you if you wouldn't mind -- I'd like to be there, if it's OK with you.
LEE
Of course you can... 
RANDI

RANDI
Thank you. (Pause) So, can I ask --
How are you?
LEE

LEE
Oh yeah?
RANDI
Yeah. Like -- Ready to pop.
70.
LEE
RANDI (CONT'D)
Oh, I didn't know that.
I didn’t know if I should
tell you,
but --
LEE
No, it’s fine. Congratulations.
RANDI
Thank you. You would probably deduce it for yourself when you see me.
Yeah.	LEE
Lee is unable to stay on the phone any longer.
RANDI	LEE (CONT'D)
So, are you still --	Actually, sorry -- I don’t
mean to cut you off. I just
gotta go pick up Patrick up
and I’m slightly late.
RANDI
That’s OK. I just wanted to make sure it’s OK if me and Josh come to the funeral.
LEE
It’s totally OK.
RANDI
OK. Thank you, Lee. God bless.
LEE
So long.
They hang up. Lee tries to keep a grip on himself.
INT. PATRICK’S ROOM. NIGHT.
Patrick lies awake in the dark.
INT. LEE’S ROOM. NIGHT.
Lee lies on the bed watching a sports show and drinking beer.
EXT. MANCHESTER -- CHURCH OF THE SACRED HEART. DAY.
A beautiful day. A lot of people are filing into the church.
71.
INT. CHURCH. DAY.
SLO-MO (MOS). People are greeting PATRICK. LEE stands to one side. Some people greet him, some do not, some look at him covertly.
GEORGE and his wife JANINE, 50, say hi to Lee and Patrick. Then a very pregnant RANDI gives Patrick a big warm hug. She and her husband, JOSH, greet Lee. Randi says a few words to Lee. Josh shakes Lee’s hand. Then they move away.
Others come through: Grown-ups and kids. DR BETHENY and her HUSBAND. George stays dutifully by Lee.
LATER -- STILL SLO-MO (MOS) THE SERVICE. FATHER MARTIN reads the service. LEE sits in the front pew, with PATRICK, looking lost.
EXT. GEORGE’S HOUSE. DAY.
George’s small, cramped, two-story house. Cars are stuffed into George’s driveway and ranged up and down the block.
INT. GEORGE’S HOUSE. DAY.
The living room is packed with mourners, eating and drinking. (Randi and Josh are not there.) PATRICK is hugging SANDY and JILL. They are leaving. He keeps an eye out for SILVIE, who is across the room talking to CJ, Joel and some other kids.
LATER -- PATRICK is in an armchair, watching LEE through the press of chatting mourners. Lee holds a beer and looks lost. TOM DOHERTY appears, shakes Lee’s hand and gives him a hug which Lee rigidly returns. MRS DOHERTY kisses Lee.
SILVIE appears at Patrick’s side. She gives him some soda in a plastic cup. Her eyes intrusively search his face.
SILVIE
You OK, baby?
PATRICK
I’m OK.
LATER -- LEE and GEORGE are talking over the din.
GEORGE
So how you holdin’ up?
LEE
What’s the matter?
GEORGE
No --
72.
LEE	GEORGE (CONT'D)
What?	-- I said “How you holdin’
Um... 	up?” It’s a stupid question.
You get some food?
LEE
I had some cheese.
GEORGE
“You had some cheese.” Asshole.
LEE	GEORGE (CONT'D)
It’s OK, George.	I’ll get you something. Hey
JANINE!
We see JANINE through the crowd, replenishing items at the buffet table and clearing paper plates and napkins, etc.
LEE
Seriously. I’m not hungry.
GEORGE
JANINE
Sure? (To JANINE) Never mind!
WHAT?
FORGET IT! SKIP IT!
I CAN’T HEAR A GODDAMN THING
I SAID FORGET IT!
YOU’RE SAYIN’!
JANINE (CONT’D)
DID LEE GET SOME FOOD?
INT. JOE’S HOUSE -- KITCHEN. NIGHT.
Lee comes in and takes off his dark jacket and gets some cold chicken from the fridge. Patrick comes in, iPhone in hand.
PATRICK
Hey, is it OK if I ask Silvie to
stay over?
LEE
No.
PATRICK
What do you mean?
LEE
I don’t want her in the house right now.
PATRICK
Why not? YOU don’t have to talk to her... 
73.
LEE
I don’t like her. You can go to her house or call one of your friends. That’s it.
Patrick is stunned.
INT. GUEST/LEE’S ROOM. NIGHT.
Lee gets ready for bed. We hear PATRICK in the hall O.C.
PATRICK (O.C.)
Would your mom be cool if I came
there? ...  I have no idea.
LATER -- Patrick KNOCKS and comes in.
PATRICK (CONT’D)
Well, I can’t go there either.
LEE
Sorry about that.
PATRICK
So... Are you gonna stay in here... ?
LEE
Well -- Yeah. Why not?
PATRICK
I thought maybe you’d want to stay in Dad’s room.
LEE
Why? You want me to?
PATRICK
No. It’s just a better room. And
he’s not usin’ it... 
LEE
I’ll stay in there. We’re not gonna be here that much longer anyway.
PATRICK
I’m not movin’ to Boston, Uncle
Lee.
LEE
I don’t wanna talk about that right now. OK?
