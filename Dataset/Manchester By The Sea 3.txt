You’re a janitor.
LEE
So what?
PATRICK
You could do that anywhere. There’s toilets and clogged-up drains all over town.
LEE	PATRICK (CONT'D)
I don’t wanna talk about it!	All my friends are here. I’m
on the hockey team. I’m on
the basketball team. I gotta
maintain our boat now. I work
You can’t maintain it --	on George’s boat two days a

Lee has no answer.
INT. JOE’S BEDROOM -- NIGHT.
Lee puts the last of his stuff away. He goes to the window.
The wind whistles outside.
10-YEAR-OLD PATRICK (V.O.)
Goodbye Uncle Lee!
FIVE YEARS AGO --
EXT. JOE’S HOUSE. DAY.
A few weeks after the girls’ funeral. Joe waits by Lee’s car, which is packed with a few boxes and a borrowed suitcase. Lee and 10-YEAR-OLD Patrick come out, carrying cardboard boxes.
A moment later, Lee slams the trunk. Patrick is inside.
JOE
Where you gonna be tonight?
LEE
I don’t know. A motel.
JOE
What time you gonna call me?
75.
LEE
When I get to the motel.
JOE
If I don’t hear from you by nine
o’clock I’m gonna call the cops.
You understand?
LEE
Yes. Yes.
JOE
Patty! Come say goodbye to Uncle
Lee!
LEE
That’s OK.
JOE
It is not OK. Patrick! Come say
goodbye!
10-YEAR-OLD PATRICK (O.S.)
Comin’!
They wait. Joe hugs Lee. Lee hugs him back woodenly. Then with more feeling. Then he breaks away and gets in the car.
LEE
I’m gonna see him... 
He starts the motor. Patrick comes running out of the house.
10-YEAR-OLD PATRICK
(Exactly as before)
Goodbye Uncle Lee!
LEE
So long.
He drives off. Joe and Patrick watch him drive away.
PRESENT --
INT. KITCHEN. NIGHT.
Patrick, in his sleeping gear, opens the refrigerator, looking for a snack. He opens the overcrowded freezer and some packages of frozen chicken breasts and chopped meat slide out at him. He tries to catch or block them, but most of them get past him and hit the floor.
INT. JOE’S ROOM. NIGHT -- SIMULTANEOUS.
At the window, Lee hears the clatter from downstairs.
76.
INT. KITCHEN. NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS.
Patrick looks down at the frozen meat and starts to breathe hard. He starts to put them back in but starts to feel sick. He leans his head against the freezer door then backs away, wiping his eyes.
PATRICK
I don’t want it. I don’t want it.
LEE comes in. Patrick can’t get ahold of himself.
LEE
PATRICK (CONT'D)
Patty --

LEE
What do you mean? Like what?
PATRICK
LEE (CONT'D)
I don’t know! I feel really
Are you sick?

LEE (CONT’D)
What do you mean?
PATRICK
Could you get that shit outta the
freezer? I feel really weird.
LEE
Get ridda what? The chicken?
PATRICK	LEE (CONT'D)

Patrick runs out of the kitchen.
INT. PATRICK’S ROOM. NIGHT.
Patrick comes in and slams the door. Pause. Lee KNOCKS O.C.
LEE (O.C.)
You gonna go to bed?
PATRICK
Leave me alone.
LEE (O.C.)
I don’t think I should let you keep the door shut.
77.
PATRICK
Just go away!
LEE (O.C.)
I will. Just open up the door.
PATRICK
Fuck you.
LEE KICKS the DOOR IN. Patrick jumps up from his bed.
PATRICK (CONT’D) Jesus! What’s your problem?
No! No! No!
No! I’m just freakin’ out.
Just go away!
No we don’t --!
LEE
I said open up the door. Are you havin’ a breakdown? Should I take you to the hospital?
Fine, but I can’t let you freak out with the door shut. And if you’re gonna freak out every time you see a frozen chicken I think maybe we should take you the hospital. I don’t know anything about this.
PATRICK
--	I just don’t like him bein’ in the freezer!
LEE
You’ve expressed that very clearly. I don't like it either. But there’s nothin’ we can do about it.
PATRICK
Just get out!
LEE
No.
PATRICK
I’m all right, OK? I just wanna be alone.
LEE (CONT'D)
I’m not gonna bother you. I’m just gonna sit here. You can be alone as soon as you calm down.
Patrick turns his face toward the wall. Silence.
PATRICK
I’m calmer now. Would you please
get out?
LEE
No.
78.
Patrick his face turned away. Lee sits there.
FIVE YEARS AGO --
INT. QUINCY -- LEE’S BASEMENT APARTMENT. DAY.
The same basement studio we saw at the beginning, minus most of the furniture. LEE stands watching JOE inspect the room. His affect is flat, colorless. 10-YEAR-OLD PATRICK is looking through the window up to the street. People’s feet walk by.
10-YEAR-OLD PATRICK
Cool!
JOE
How much are they payin’ you?
LEE
Minimum wage plus the room.
JOE
Let’s go get some furniture.
LEE
I got furniture.
JOE
No you don’t. This doesn’t count as furniture. This is not a room. Let’s go get some furniture.
LEE
Get off my back.
JOE
Patty, come on. (To Lee) Let’s go.
INT. BOSTON DEPARTMENT STORE. DAY.
Joe stands with Lee looking at an armchair. Patrick is spinning around in another one.
JOE
You like that one?

I love it.
JOE
Good. Now you got an armchair.

JOE
You got a light bulb. Let’s go get a lamp. Patty, come on.

THE PRESENT --
INT. THE KITCHEN. DAY.
Lee and Patrick are at the breakfast table. Patrick is eating breakfast. Lee has coffee.
LEE
Listen. (Pause) We can stay until your school lets out. That’ll give me time to set things up in Boston better. You can do some stuff with George in the summer if you want
... And you don’t get jerked out of your life overnight.
PATRICK
Are you askin’ me or tellin’ me?
LEE
I’m tellin’ you it’s the best I can do.
PATRICK
(On “you”)
Then what the fuck do you care
whether it’s OK with me or not?
Pause.
LEE
It’s half an hour away! You can
come back here any time you want!
80.
PATRICK
From Quincy?
PATRICK (CONT’D) What is that, a joke? It’s an hour and a half at least! You gotta include the other cars.
You couldn’t get from here to Quincy in half an hour if you flew in a fuckin’ spaceship!
LEE
Yes! No! Depending on the traffic. Fifty minutes.
But we don’t have to stay there! We could look in Charlestown, or Everett --
LEE (CONT’D)
OK, fuck it.
INT. LEE’S CAR/MANCHESTER ESSEX REGIONAL HIGH SCHOOL. DAY.
Lee and Patrick pull up in front of school.
PATRICK
I need lunch money.
Lee reaches for his wallet. TWO GIRLS rap on the car window as they pass by on their way into the building.
1ST GIRL
Hi, Patrick! Hi, Patrick!
2ND GIRL
Hi, Patrick!
1ST GIRL
Hey Patrick -- !
Patrick unrolls the window.
1ST GIRL (CONT’D)
So are you goin’ to Godspell?
PATRICK
I’m thinkin’ about it.
1ST GIRL
OK, ‘bye.
They move on, giggling. Lee reaches for his wallet.
LEE
Are they your girlfriends too?
PATRICK
They wish.
81.
LEE
Doesn’t George pay you a salary for helpin’ with his boat?
PATRICK
Yeah, but I’m savin’ that.
LEE
For what?
PATRICK
New motor.
Pause. He gives Patrick $20. Patrick gets out of the car.
LEE
You goin’ to Godspell?
INT. JOE’S BEDROOM. DUSK.
Lee puts the THREE FRAMED PHOTOS on the dresser. He goes to the window and looks out. He BREAKS the WINDOW with his FIST. Blood wells out of his knuckles immediately. He hurries to the bathroom. The LAND LINE RINGS.
LEE (O.C.)
Come on... !
He comes out, wrapping his hand in a towel. The blood soaks through quickly. He picks up the phone.
LEE (CONT’D)
Hello?
INT. ELISE’S HOUSE. DAY -- CONTINUOUS.
Elise, dressed neatly and primly, is on the phone.
ELISE
(Over the phone)
Hello, is that Lee?
WE CUT BETWEEN ELISE AND LEE.
Lee freezes. He does not respond.
ELISE (CONT’D)
(Over the phone)
Hello? Lee? It’s Elise. (Pause)
Hello?
LEE does not respond. Blood stains the towel on his hand.
82.
INT. JOE’S HOUSE -- DINING ROOM. NIGHT.
Lee and Patrick sit across from each other at the dinner table, eating. Lee has a bandage on his hand.
PATRICK
What happened to your hand?
LEE
I cut it.
PATRICK
Oh. For a minute there I didn’t
know what happened.
INT. JOE’S ROOM. NIGHT.
Patrick comes into the room. Lee is VACUUMING up broken glass by the window. He has neatly taped a cardboard square over the broken pane. He sees Patrick and turns off the vacuum. He throws the last scraps of cardboard and tape into a heavy duty trash bag full of broken glass, cardboard, etc.
PATRICK
Is there some reason why you didn’t tell me my mom tried to call me?
Lee stops in his tracks.
PATRICK (CONT’D)
She wrote me you hung up on her. She’s in Essex. She wants me to see her new house and meet her fiancee. (Pause) What’d you think? She couldn’t get in touch with me?
LEE
I hung up because I didn’t know what to say to her. And I didn’t tell you ‘cause I didn’t know what to say to you. I’m sorry.
PATRICK
You can’t stop me talkin’ to her.
LEE
I don’t care what you do.
He ties off the garbage bag and goes out. Patrick follows --
INT. HALLWAY/STAIRS/LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN. CONTINUOUS.
They go down the hall, stairs, into the kitchen... 
83.
PATRICK
No, but you won’t let my girlfriend come over and you hate my mother so much you won’t even tell me that she called. You’d rather drag me back to Quincy and ruin my life than somebody else be my guardian --
LEE
There is nobody else.
PATRICK
I can live in Essex with my mom.
LEE
No you can’t.
PATRICK
But if she's not an alcoholic anymore and she wants me to stay with her, then I can take the bus to my same school and keep all my friends, and the boat, and you can go back to Boston, and you can still -- I don't know: Like, check in on me, or whatever, if you want to... 
LEE
I can’t do that.
PATRICK
Why?
LEE
I'm sorry I hung up on her. I’ll call her back, and if she sounds semi-human to me, you can go have lunch with her and her fiancee if you want. I don’t wanna talk about this anymore.
Lee goes out the back door with the garbage.

Lee watches them go and then turns and walks away.
INT. BOAT YARD -- FRONT OFFICE. DAY.
JERRY, 40s, is just coming into the front office as LEE comes thru the customer door. Jerry is immediately uncomfortable.
JERRY
Hey...  Lee... ! Well, what do you

LEE
How you doin’, Jerry?
JERRY
Not bad, not too bad. I was sorry
to hear about Joe.
LEE
Yeah. Thank you.
JERRY

JERRY
Good. So what’s goin’ on?

Lee and Patrick get in the car and start driving.
LEE
How’s the motor?
PATRICK
George says the piston’s gonna go right through the block any minute now.
86.
LEE
Unfortunately that’s a problem. We can’t afford to keep the boat if we can’t hire somebody to work it, and we can’t get anyone to work it, if it’s got a broken motor.
PATRICK
Let’s take out a loan.
LEE
And pay it back with what?
PATRICK
We hire it out til we pay the loan back, obviously.
LEE
Unfortunately for you, I’m
responsible for your finances until
you’re twenty-one, and I’m not
comfortable takin’ out enormous
loans on your behalf right now.
PATRICK
I have band practice. Can you drive me home to get my stuff and then drive me to Sandy’s house?
LEE
Why don’t you sign up for driver’s ed?
PATRICK
LEE (CONT'D)
Because Dad made me promise

EXT. SANDY & JILL’S HOUSE. NIGHT.
Lee’s car idles in front of the house.
PATRICK
You wanna stay for dinner? I think Sandy’s mother likes you.
LEE
No she doesn’t.
PATRICK
Yes she does. This could be good
for both of us.
87.
LEE
I’d really rather not.
PATRICK
Well, can you at least hang out with her so I can be alone with Sandy for half an hour without her mother knockin’ on the door every twenty seconds?
LEE	PATRICK (CONT'D)
Come on, man.	All you gotta do is talk to
her! Why can’t you help me
out a little bit for once
instead of draggin’ me to the
lawyers and the funeral
parlor and the morgue? Anyway
she’s really nice!
OK.	LEE
PATRICK
Thank you.
INT. SANDY’S HOUSE -- BASEMENT. NIGHT.

Otto, man --
OTTO
What? I'm too slow?
CJ
Too fast.
OTTO
I'm too fast?
88.
JOEL
Dude, you're like pullin’ outta the fuckin’ station ahead of me.
SANDY
Oh my God, you guys! Leave him
alone.
CJ
Are you serious about this band or what?
OTTO
Get off my back.
CJ
All right, everybody just chill
here. Let's just go again.
Everyone resets.
PATRICK
(into microphone)
We are Stentorian.
INT. JILL’S LIVING ROOM. NIGHT.
Lee and Jill are alone in the living room. She has a glass of wine. He has a beer. Silence.
JILL
Patrick’s one of my favorite
people.
LEE
That’s good.
Silence. Jill twists around.
JILL
(Calls up the stairs)
How’s it goin’ up there, you guys?
Silence. Then there is some O.C. giggling and A DOOR OPENS.
SANDY
It’s going fine! Thanks! But we’re right in the middle of something!
PATRICK
Good! Really good! We’re totally rippin’ through those compound fractions!
There is more laughing and the DOOR SHUTS O.C.
89.
JILL
At least we know where they are,
right?
LEE
That’s true... 
INT. SANDY’S ROOM. SIMULTANEOUS.
Sandy comes away from the door. They are in their underwear. Patrick discards an unused, unrolled condom and GETS UP to get another from his pants, across the darkened room.
PATRICK
Hold on a sec.
SANDY
How many of those you generally gotta go through before you pick a winner?
PATRICK
I’d like to see you use one of these goddamn things with all these interruptions -- Ow!
He trips over something with a crash.
SANDY
What happened? Are you OK?
PATRICK
I tripped over your fuckin’ doll
house.
SANDY
Oh my God, did you break it?
PATRICK
I don’t know. I’m fine though, by
the way.
Sandy snaps the light on.
SANDY
Oh my God. My grandmother gave me that when I was five years old. It was literally her doll house from when she was a little girl.
PATRICK
Well what’s it doin’ on the fuckin’ floor?
90.
SANDY
It’s a doll house! That’s where you play with it!
JILL (O.S.)
Sandy? What is going on up there?
SANDY
Nothing! Patrick stubbed his toe on
Mummer’s doll house, but it’s OK!
JILL
Sandy, that doll house belonged to my mother!
SANDY	JILL (CONT'D)
Yes I know, Mom! It was just	If you’re gonna smash it to
an accident. Nobody’s	pieces I wish you’d let me
smashin’ it to pieces! It’s	keep it somewhere else!

Don’t worry, Jill, I’m OK! My
toe’s gonna be OK!
INT. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS.
Jill turns back to Lee, smiles and shrugs. Silence.
JILL
Could I get you another beer, Lee?
LEE
I’m good. Thanks.
Jill sips her wine. Lee can’t think of anything to say.
JILL
Would you excuse me, Lee, one sec?
LEE
Sure.
INT. SANDY’S ROOM. CONTINUOUS.
The only light comes from Sandy’s laptop. They’re on the bed.
SANDY
Is it on?
PATRICK
Yes. It’s a miracle.
SANDY
OK. Hurry up.
91.
JILL KNOCKS. Patrick and Sandy leap away from each other.
JILL
Hey, Sandy? I’m sorry... !
PATRICK
Goddamn it!
SANDY (CONT'D)
One second please! (To
Patrick) Get outta my way!
AT THE DOOR, A MOMENT LATER -- Jill is talking to SANDY through a crack in the door. Patrick is pretending to work at the laptop. Sandy and he have pulled on their clothes.
SANDY
What’s up?
JILL
I’m really sorry, I know you’re
trying to work, but I can’t sit
down there much longer.
SANDY
Why? What’s the problem?
JILL
He won’t talk. I’ve been trying to make conversation for half an hour!
SANDY
Are you serious?
JILL	PATRICK
I realize I’m not the most	What’s the matter?
fascinating person in the	SANDY
world, but it’s very, very
strained.	Mom... 
SANDY
She can't make your Uncle speak.
PATRICK
He likes sports.
JILL	SANDY
I'm sorry to bust things up,	Sports?
but how much longer do you	PATRICK
think you're gonna be?
I'm sorry... !	Can you talk about sports?
Maybe there’s a game on you

SANDY (TO PATRICK) (CONT’D)
Shut up. (To Jill) Mummy, Please.

to my home.
INT. ELISE’S HOUSE. CONTINUOUS.
JEFFREY stands waiting as Elise ushers them in. He is in his late 40s, slight, well groomed and dressed in conservative weekend wear. Slacks, loafers, a light-weight sweater. LEE glances around the very tidy house. There is a framed pastel of Jesus on the wall.
ELISE

Nobody’s tryin’ to recruit you!
PATRICK

ELISE
You did? OK. You don't have to...

INT. PATRICK’S ROOM. NIGHT.
Patrick sits at his laptop, wet from the shower. He opens an email from JEFFGARNDER7@YAHOO.COM. We see the first few lines and hear JEFFREY’S VOICE at the same time.
JEFFREY V.O.
“Dear Patrick, I’m writing on to thank you for today. Your visit meant the world to your mom. We are both deeply grateful for the love and trust you’ve shown by offering to rejoin her life.
(MORE)
98.
JEFFREY V.O. (CONT'D) But I feel it would be unfair to your mom to rush her along the long and challenging road ahead, and so I’m going to ask you to write to me in future to arrange any further visits. I hope you won’t find this to be --”
ON PATRICK as he reads on. He DELETES the MESSAGE.

PATRICK
Who are you gonna shoot? You or me?
LEE
Do you know how much these guns are worth?

That’s a really good idea.

He moves away. Randi breaks down.
INT. WATERFRONT BAR & GRILLE. DAY.
CU LEE, very drunk. He is at the counter of a busy local place full of fishermen eating and drinking their lunch. A new bunch of guys comes in loudly and boisterously. One of them accidentally clips Lee as the group passes by.
FISHERMAN
Pardon me.
LEE
It’s all right.
Lee whirls around and sucker punches the Fisherman. He goes down hard. His friends immediately grab at Lee en masse.
FISHERMEN
Hey! Hey! What’re you doin’? Etc.
Lee is pushed into some tables -- The whole place is in an uproar -- He is jumped by several guys. He keeps fighting crazily. Someone tries to pin his arms to stop the fight. Everyone is shouting.
GEORGE appears. He uses his size to shove the other guys away from Lee.
GEORGE
Break it up! Break it up! It's Lee Chandler. Lee! Let him go, Eddy. He's Joey Chandler's brother. Let him go! Lee. Lee! It's George. Lee. Come on -- (To the guys who beat Lee up) You won. OK? You won the fight.

GEORGE (CONT’D)
OK, OK, OK!

Lee is dazed, lying on the sofa in George's cramped living room. George watches anxiously as George’s wife Janine finishes washing and bandaging Lee’s banged up face. George is a little banged up too.
JANINE
... Should we take him to the
hospital?
GEORGE
I don't think so. Nothin’s broken.
JANINE
... What the hell did they hit him
with, a fuckin’ baseball bat?
GEORGE
They all just said he started
swingin’.
Lee wakes up.
LEE
Where’s Patrick?
GEORGE
He’s with the kids. I sent ‘em out for burgers.
LEE
Lemme give you some money.
Lee sits up painfully and reaches for his wallet.
GEORGE
Lee. Please. It‘s my treat.
Lee stands up and fumbles for his wallet and drops it on the floor. George picks it up and gives it to him.
GEORGE (CONT’D)
Would you sit down please, for
Christ’s sake?
LEE
OK.
Lee sits down and breaks into tears.
GEORGE
Come on, buddy.
George looks uncomfortable. He looks up toward the kitchen.
Janine comes back in with coffee and sits next to Lee.
105.
LEE
I’m sorry... 
GEORGE
That’s OK, buddy. It’s OK...

LEE
No, honey... You’re not burning.
LEE WAKES UP -- There’s SMOKE coming from the KITCHEN.

LEE
I got a job in Boston. It starts in
July.
PATRICK
What is it?
LEE
Custodian, handyman... But just two buildings this time.
PATRICK
And what delightful Boston neighborhood have you selected for us to live in?
LEE
None.
PATRICK
What do you mean?
LEE
You don’t have to move to Boston.
I’m gonna be in Charlestown and
George is gonna take you.
PATRICK
What?
LEE
Yeah. I talked to them last week. I explained the situation to them. Georgie Junior’s goin’ to school this fall. Jimmy graduates next year. We’ll have to rent out this house. You can move back in when you turn eighteen. When you turn twenty-one, you’re allowed to sell it or stay in it, or whatever you want. Definitely have to hire the boat out when the summer’s over -- just like we talked about. I thought when you get your license, we can figure that one out as we go. I'm still the trustee, but all the financial stuff Joe set up for me is gonna get transferred over to George.
(MORE)
108.
LEE (CONT'D)
So everything’ll be the same,
except you don’t have to move.
PATRICK
But... like, are they gonna be my
guardians? Or do you still --
LEE
They’re gonna adopt you. (Pause) Anyway, that's how I set it up. If you want. It's up to you.
PATRICK
So are you gonna just
disappear?
LEE (CONT'D)
You don’t have to do it. No. No. I just set it up so you can stay here. They’re really glad to have you. They love you.
PATRICK
I know. I mean, they’re great... But why can’t you stay?
Patty starts crying.
LEE
Come on, Patty... I can’t beat it.
(Pause) I can’t beat it. I’m sorry.
Patrick wipes his eyes. Lee comes over and hugs him.
EXT. MANCHESTER STREET/ROSEDALE CEMETERY. DAY.

HOMEOWNER
Are you one of Stan Chandler’s
boys?
LEE
Yeah, I’m Lee.

LEE

PATRICK
What for?
LEE
In case you wanna visit sometime. Or if you’re lookin’ at colleges in Boston or somethin’ and you wanna stay overnight... 
PATRICK
I’m not goin’ to college.
LEE
All right, well then I'll have an
extra room for all my shit. Do we
have to talk about this now?
PATRICK
Nope.
He tosses away his ice cream stick.
After a minute Lee wipes his eyes. He bounces the ball and tosses it to Patrick. It goes wide and bounces crazily.

Great throw.
LEE
Just let it go.
Patrick runs to gets the ball. They continue to walk up the hill, bouncing the ball across the street to each other and chasing it when it rolls back down the hill.

A FEW MOMENTS LATER -- Lee and Patrick are seated, fishing off the back of the boat. They talk quietly. Lee looks a little better than we’ve seen him. He squints at the sea and the wide open sky.
FADE OUT.
