EXT. FARM - DAY

It is a hot summer day. A large run down farm house, several sheds, a red roof barn and a decrepid silo sit between fields of dry, uncut grass, in a serene isolated valley.

TWO MEN tack together a broken fence that encloses an overgrown paddock.

THREE WOMEN work in a vegetable garden.

TWO WOMEN hang wet clothes on a clothes line.

TWO MEN work in a cluttered garage on an old car.

FOUR WOMEN sit in a circle on a broken down, buckling front porch. One woman breast feeds a new born. The others knit a large blanket.

TWO WOMEN and TWO MEN swim naked in a swimming hole.

A MAN in his forties sits alone in a room reading.

A MAN chops wood.

A bare foot TODDLER plays alone in the driveway.


INT. FARM HOUSE - DAY

A large room with unfinished wood walls has several blankets and pillows laid out like beds on the floor.

TWO WOMEN are in the kitchen preparing food.

MARTHA, sets a table for eight. Martha is beautiful but appears run down. She is 24 years old but her weathered face makes her look older. A bell rings off screen.
 


INT. FARM HOUSE DINING ROOM - EVENING
 

The men sit around a table eating dinner.

One man sits at the head of the table, this is PATRICK. Patrick is older than the other men. To his right is WATTS, a man in his early twenties with a greasy patchy beard.

2.




INT. FARM HOUSE KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

The women are scattered around the kitchen waiting. The men finish dinner, pass through the kitchen and walk outside.

The women file into the dining room, clear the men's dishes, put more chairs around the table, and bring out a new serving of food.


INT. FARM HOUSE DINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

The women sit around the table eating very small portions of low protein food. Katie sits at the head of the table.

CUT TO:


INT. FARM HOUSE - EARLY MORNING

The kitchen is filled with dishes.

TWO BABIES sleep next to each other in an old broken crib. A teenage girl sleeps on the floor next to the crib.

People are strewn all over the house sleeping. Suddenly, a figure passes quickly through frame.


EXT. FARM HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Martha walks out the front door, across the porch, and up the driveway. She carries a small bag.

Her pace becomes increasingly faster. She looks back to see a teenage girl, SARAH, standing in the window watching.
 

Martha turns and walks faster, heading straight for the woods. As she gets to the edge of the trees she begins to run.

SLOW ZOOM: MARTHA DISAPPEARS INTO THE THICK WOODS.

Off screen, the house DOOR SLAMS SHUT. A MAN urgently yells out: "MARCY MAY"

The camera holds on the trees shaking gently in the wind.
For a moment everything is quiet.
3.


Suddenly, A MAN and TWO WOMEN enter frame and run into the woods, chasing after Martha.


EXT. WOODS - CONTINUOUS

The woods are dark. Martha runs as fast as she can. She hears the MAN's voice calling her from a distance. A man and two women are chasing her.

Martha arrives at a steep heavily wooded hill. She keeps running at full speed, then slips, falls, and rolls.

Martha ducks behind a fallen tree and looks back to see the group arrive at the ridge to survey the woods and begin their descent.

Martha holds still, listening as the people chasing her pass by.


EXT. DINER PARKING LOT - DAY

Martha uses a pay phone at a diner. She dials and waits. She is struck by the voice that answers, she transforms from being a zombie to being flooded with emotion.

LUCY

Hello. Hello?

MARTHA

Hi!

LUCY
Martha?

MARTHA

Yeah.
 

LUCY

Oh my god! Where are you?

MARTHA

I'm not sure. Upstate I think.

LUCY

You're in New York?

MARTHA

I think. Yeah.

LUCY

When did you get back?
4.



Martha doesn't know what to say, she bursts into tears.

LUCY (CONT'D)

Martha? What's wrong? What's happened?

MARTHA

I don't know. I should go back.

LUCY

Go back where?

MARTHA

I have to go, I can't stay gone.

LUCY

No, no, no. Don't go. What are you
talking about?

MARTHA

Sorry for calling.

LUCY

Martha! Don't hang up. Please! Do not hang up.
(BEAT)

Do you want me to come get you?

MARTHA

I can't wait that long.

LUCY

What do you mean? Tell me where you are and I'll come right now.
 

MARTHA

It's okay, you don't have to-

LUCY

I want to see you Martha. Please.

Martha thinks for a moment.

LUCY (CONT'D)
Martha!


INT. DINER - DAY

Martha sits alone in a booth hunched over a grilled cheese sandwich and french fries. She devours the food like she hasn't eaten in days.
5.



The entrance bell rings. Martha turns around and cautiously peers over the booth. A FAMILY walks in. They are seated. Martha returns to eating.

MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

Marcy May?

It is Watts. His voice paralyzes her.

WATTS

What are you doin'?

Martha stops eating. He slides into the booth and sits across from her.

Watts reaches over and takes some french fries. He eats them slowly, enjoying every bite. She can't look at him.

WATTS (CONT'D)
We were worried about you.

MARTHA

I'm fine.

WATTS

Patrick's worried about you.

MARTHA

I just wanted to come into town.
 
WATTS

I could've brought you.

MARTHA
I wanted to walk.

WATTS

Through the woods?

WAITRESS
(TO WATTS)

Can I get you something?

WATTS

No.

WAITRESS
(TO MARTHA)

You done?

MARTHA

Yeah.
6.



The waitress goes to take Martha's plate. Watts puts his hand out to stop her.

WATTS
(TO MARTHA)

You not gonna eat that?

Watts takes the half grilled cheese sandwich and stuffs it into his mouth. The waitress clears the plate.

Watts takes Martha's napkin and wipes the grease from his hands and mouth while he chews.

WATTS (CONT'D)

You ready to go?

Martha doesn't respond.

WATTS (CONT'D)

Come on!

MARTHA
Not right now.

WATTS

No?
 

The waitress drops the check on the table.

Watts stares at Martha for another moment before reaching into his pocket to pull out a mess of small papers. He sorts through them and separates a $20 bill. He stuffs the rest of the papers back into his pocket. He grabs her hand, places the money in her palm and grips it closed.

WATTS (CONT'D)
I'll get this.

He lets go. Her hand goes limp and the money falls on the table. She does not look at him. He leans in and forces eye contact with her.

Watts, growing increasingly tense, stands up and glances around the diner. It is very busy. He does not want to make a scene in front of all these people.

He leans down and kisses Martha on the cheek. She doesn't kiss back. He holds his forehead to her forehead until she reacts. She reluctantly kisses him on the lips.

Martha watches him walk outside. As soon as his back is turned, she gets up, runs through the diner, and suddenly cuts through the kitchen.
7.




EXT. BUS STOP - LATER

Martha sits on the ground hiding between two benches at an empty bus stop. She does not look well. She turns and vomits behind the bench.


EXT. BUS STOP - LATER

Martha hides between two parked buses. She watches a BLACK BMW pull into the parking lot. LUCY, a well dressed woman in her early 30's, gets out of the car. Martha walks towards Lucy. Lucy rushes over and hugs Martha.


INT. LUCY'S CAR - DAY

Martha, wrapped in Lucy's sweater, leans her head against the window watching the road behind her in the side view mirror.
 

LUCY

It's nice to see you.

MARTHA

You too.

Lucy notices that Martha's left ear is bruised.

LUCY
What's going on?

MARTHA

Not much.

LUCY
You alright?

MARTHA

Yeah.

LUCY

You sure?

MARTHA

Yeah.

LUCY

You were pretty upset on the phone.

MARTHA

Sorry. I over reacted.
8.



LUCY

To what?

Martha thinks.

LUCY (CONT'D)

What happened?

MARTHA

We had a fight.

LUCY
Who?

MARTHA

Me and this guy.
 

LUCY

Who?

Martha doesn't answer.

LUCY (CONT'D)

Your boyfriend?

Martha nods.

LUCY (CONT'D)

Did he hurt you?

MARTHA

No!

LUCY

Are you sure?

MARTHA

No. I'm fine.

Lucy is skeptical.

LUCY

Did you guys break up?

Martha nods.

LUCY (CONT'D)

How long were you together?

MARTHA

A	while.
9.



LUCY

How long?

MARTHA

I don't know. Maybe a year, maybe more or less.

LUCY

And you were here the whole time?

Martha nods.

LUCY (CONT'D)
 

You've been back in New York for over a year and you haven't called me?

MARTHA
I'm sorry.

Lucy is upset but manages to remain calm.

LUCY

Well, I'm glad you're here now.


INT. LAKE HOUSE/MARTHA'S BEDROOM - EVENING

Lucy makes the bed. Martha enters the room wrapped in a towel. Her hair drips on the floor.

LUCY

I made you some tea.

MARTHA

Thanks.

Lucy takes a small hand towel and dries Martha's hair.

LUCY

Ted should be up from the city soon.
He'll cook us some dinner.

MARTHA

I'm pretty tired, is it okay if I just go to bed?

LUCY

Of course.
(BEAT)

Get some sleep, you'll be as good as new tomorrow.
10.



Lucy leaves. Martha gets under the sheets wrapped in her wet towel.


INT. LAKE HOUSE KITCHEN - NIGHT

Lucy sits at the kitchen table with a glass of RED WINE. The front door opens. She puts on a smile as TED enters. He speaks with a BRITISH ACCENT. He sets down his bag and gives her a hug and a kiss.
 

TED

Well?

LUCY

She seems okay.

TED

What did she say?

LUCY

Not much, she's pretty tired.

TED

Where's she been?

LUCY

She had some boyfriend, they were living in the Catskills.

TED

What?

LUCY

It's okay.

TED

Not really Lucy.

LUCY

It's fine. She's here now.

Ted keeps his comments to himself.

TED
(HALF JOKING)

Well, how long's she staying?

LUCY
(LAUGHING)

I don't know.
11.



TED

I told you she was fine. You spend all that time worrying.

Ted kisses her on the forehead and walks to the liquor cabinet and pours a scotch.
 
CUT TO:


INT. LAKE HOUSE KITCHEN - NIGHT

The house is completely dark. Martha finds her way through the hallway and into the kitchen. She drinks water from the faucet with an insatiable thirst.

The kitchen has large windows, through which a bright spot light, lights the porch but pitch black darkness is beyond that. Martha is scared to look outside. She forces herself to slowly turn and look. She puts her head down and quickly returns to her room.


INT. LAKE HOUSE/MARTHA'S BEDROOM - MORNING

Martha is wrapped in a wet towel sleeping on the floor.

LUCY

Martha? Why are you on the floor?

Martha does not know where she is. A moment passes before she starts to come to.

MARTHA

I'm sorry.

LUCY

It's okay, you were in a deep sleep. Come have some breakfast.


INT. LAKE HOUSE KITCHEN - DAY

Lucy and Ted eat at the kitchen table. Martha enters.

TED

Martha! Welcome!

MARTHA

Hi.
12.



TED

Great to finally meet you. You sleep alright?

MARTHA
 
Yeah.

LUCY

How do you like the house?

TED

It's just a rental.

LUCY

Well I love it.

Lucy puts some eggs on a plate for Martha.

MARTHA

It's nice. I didn't know there was a lake.

LUCY

Yeah. Do you still like to swim?

MARTHA

You don't live in the city anymore?

LUCY

We do. This is for weekends and holidays.

Ted and Lucy eat, Martha takes miniscule bites.

LUCY (CONT'D)

Ted's finishing a new building down town and when it's done we're taking one of the new apartments. You want to see pictures?

Lucy gets up from the table and walks to another room.
Martha sniffs her food. Ted doesn't notice.

TED
(TO MARTHA)

Do you think she's excited to have you back?

Lucy re-enters with her digital camera.

LUCY

This is the view, the interiors are obviously not finished. It's nice right?

(MORE)
13.

LUCY (CONT'D)

We were supposed to move in the spring
 

but construction halted, so, it'll just be a little while longer.

TED
(SARCASTIC)

Yep, just a little while longer.

LUCY

Okay, sorry, no more work talk.

Lucy notices that Martha isn't eating.

LUCY (CONT'D)

Aren't you hungry?

MARTHA
Not really, sorry.

TED

Well, you've got to eat.

LUCY

It's okay, I can fix you something later.

Martha, feeling on the spot, forces down a big bite.


EXT. LAKE HOUSE DOCK - DAY

Martha sits cross legged on a sun bed looking out to the lake. Ted naps while Lucy sun bathes reading THE MOTHER
OF ALL BABY BOOKS.

MARTHA

Where are we?

LUCY

Connecticut.

MARTHA

How far are we?

LUCY

From what?

MARTHA

Yesterday.

Lucy is confused. She tries to make sense of the question.

LUCY
 
You mean where I picked you up?
14.



Martha nods.

LUCY (CONT'D)

About 3 hours.
(BEAT)
Why?

MARTHA

Just wondered.

Lucy goes back to reading. Martha lies down and stares at the sky. A light banging sound starts to echo over the lake.


EXT. FARM FIELD - DAY

THE SOUND IS THE SAME AS THE LAKE: A light breeze in the trees and the water gently hitting the dock.

Patrick and two men build a fence.

CUT TO:

Martha lies in the open field smoking cigarettes with ZOE, a girl in her early twenties.

Martha is younger, more energetic and confident. They are laughing and talking when Zoe notices Patrick walking towards them.

ZOE

Put out your cigarette.

MARTHA
(SMILING)
Why?

ZOE

Just do it.

They put out their cigarettes. Zoe buries them in the grass. Patrick approaches them.

MARTHA

Is that him?
 
ZOE

Yeah.
(CALLING OUT)

Hey!
15.



PATRICK

Is this Martha?

MARTHA

Hi!

PATRICK

How're you doing?

Patrick crouches down over Zoe but smiles at Martha.

MARTHA

Great. You've got a really nice place here.

PATRICK

It's as much yours as it is mine.

He glances at her legs, then back up to her face. He turns his attention to Zoe.

PATRICK (CONT'D)

I thought you quit?

ZOE

I did.

PATRICK

It's disgusting.

ZOE

I know. I'm sorry.

PATRICK

Don't apologize to me, it's your body.

Patrick gestures towards Martha.

PATRICK (CONT'D)

Look after this girl properly Zoe, she deserves some real care for once in her life.

ZOE
 
I will.

MARTHA

She's been great, everyone's been great.

PATRICK

Good.
(BEAT)

You look like a Marcy May.
16.



MARTHA

Marcy was my grandmothers name.

PATRICK

Well, there you go.

He continues to walk through the field. Zoe and Martha recline into the grass and continue talking.

TED (O.S.)
I'm going for a dip. Anyone want to join?

MARTHA

Sure.

Martha stands up and brushes herself off.

MARTHA (CONT'D)

You coming?


EXT. LAKE HOUSE DOCK - CONTINUOUS

Martha turns to Zoe but Lucy is there instead, lying on the sun bed, lost in her book. Lucy does not answer.

Ted runs down the dock and dives into the water. Martha follows. Ted looks back to see Martha stand at the end of the dock, take off her clothes and dive in naked.

Martha swims, lost in her own world.

Lucy notices Martha, grabs a towel, and walks down to the end of the dock. Ted swims back and gets out.

TED
(SMIRKING)

Brilliant choice of swim wear.
 

Lucy is not amused. Ted walks away laughing. He turns to sneak one more glimpse of Martha.

LUCY
Martha! What are you doing?

MARTHA

What?

LUCY

Would you put some clothes on, you can't swim naked.
17.



MARTHA

Why?

LUCY

You just can't. There are kids around and people come by.

MARTHA

So?

LUCY

So you can't. We don't, just don't. I have a bathing suit you can borrow.

Martha gets out of the water. Lucy wraps the towel around her and walks away. Martha dries off. She feels embarrassed.


INT. LAKE HOUSE/MARTHA'S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON

Martha sleeps. Lucy notices the bruising on Martha's ear.

LUCY

Martha!
(BEAT)

I've been trying to wake you. You should get up or you won't sleep through the night.

Martha wakes up.

LUCY (CONT'D)

You should eat.

MARTHA
 

I will. I'm just going to sleep a little more first okay?

LUCY

Okay. I'm sorry I got frustrated with you before.

MARTHA

It's okay.

Lucy leaves. Martha opens the window and dumps the pasta outside then goes back to sleep.
18.




INT. LAKE HOUSE DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

TED

She's not coming?

LUCY

She's in a really deep sleep. I can't wake her.

TED

She seems a bit off, no?

LUCY

She's just really tired.
(BEAT)

She's had a bad breakup. I want to give her a couple days to get situated, you know?

TED

Has she always been like this?

LUCY

A pain in my ass, yes.

They laugh.


INT. MARTHA'S BEDROOM / LAKE HOUSE - NIGHT

Martha sits up in bed wide awake. She turns and stares out her window into the dark trees that surround the lake house.

CUT TO:
 


EXT. FARM HOUSE FRONT PORCH - NIGHT

An OLD BROWN CAR pulls out of the driveway.

Martha sweeps the front porch. She notices the car pull away.

MAX, A young man in his early twenties, comes outside and sits down next to her. Max is warm, nice, and care free. He's not very bright but he is a good time to be around.

MAX

Hey Marcy.
19.



MARTHA

Hey Max.
(BEAT)

Where do they go at night?

MAX

I don't know, I never get invited.

He jumps over the banister and reaches under the porch.

MAX (CONT'D)

You want to have a drink with me?

He pulls out a little flask and shakes it. A mischievous smile grows on his face.

MAX (CONT'D)

They won't be back for a few hours.

MARTHA

I shouldn't. I'm not going to drink for awhile, I think it's a good idea for me.

MAX

Alright.

MARTHA

Patrick'll know.

MAX

It's cool, I'm good at hiding it.
 
INT. FARM HOUSE BEDROOM - MORNING

KATIE

We switch off jobs each day so we all know how to do different things.
(BEAT)

Do you knit?
20.



MARTHA

No. I can learn though.

KATIE

It's okay, you'll find your role. It takes time for people to find their role in a new family.

Katie pours the cleaner on the floor, it sloshes around.

KATIE (CONT'D)

We sell blankets in town. We still need some money, but when the farm's up and running we'll be self sufficient and we'll never have to worry about it again.

MARTHA
When do you think that'll happen?

KATIE

Hopefully by the end of the summer but we'll see. It's hard to get machinery and live stock without cash.

MARTHA

That'll be nice.

Katie accidentally drops a plate.
 

KATIE

Shoot.

Martha gets down and starts to clean it up.


EXT. FARM - DAY

Martha, Watts, Max, Zoe and a few others sit around and listen to two men play guitar. Everyone is talking and laughing and having a nice time.

Patrick approaches. He observes everyone for a moment, he seems agitated. He speaks above everyone and above the music.

PATRICK

How's everything going so far Marcy May?

MARTHA

Good.

The guys stop playing music.
21.



PATRICK
You like it here?

MARTHA

Yeah, it's really nice.

PATRICK
I want you to feel at home.

MARTHA

I do. Thanks.

PATRICK

People have abandoned you your whole life. I don't blame you for not trusting anyone.

MARTHA

What?

PATRICK

If you ever want to have a meaningful relationship, you need to let your guard down.
 

Martha is embarrassed and feels on the spot.

PATRICK (CONT'D)

It's not your fault, but it's there. If you feel safe here, and I think you do, let us in. We just want to help you.

ZOE

Yeah, we think you're fucking awesome.

PATRICK

If you're going to live here then really be apart of things.


INT. LAKE HOUSE KITCHEN - MORNING

Lucy is putting away groceries. Martha enters.

LUCY

Good morning. How are you feeling today?

MARTHA

Good.

LUCY

There's this great juice shop in town, I got us a couple of juices.
(MORE)

22.

LUCY (CONT'D)

This one is Kale with ginseng. It gives me energy, so I thought it might help you.

Martha takes a sip. It tastes terrible but she drinks it.

LUCY (CONT'D)

I got pineapple orange too if that's better.

MARTHA

Maybe that's better. Sorry, thanks.

LUCY

I also got a box of these protein bars just in case you want to snack.

Martha watches Lucy put the groceries away.
 
MARTHA

Why is the house so big?

LUCY
It's not that big.

MARTHA

For two people, it's huge.

LUCY
We like to entertain. Our friends
come up for weekends and sometimes
we have parties. It's just good to
have space.

MARTHA
So no one else lives here?

LUCY

Of course no one else lives here.


EXT. LAKE / BOAT - DAY

It is hot, sunny, and peaceful. Martha sits cross legged. Ted reads the newspaper. Lucy sunbathes. Martha notices they wear wedding rings.

MARTHA
(SURPRISED)

You're married?

LUCY

Yeah.
23.



MARTHA

When?

LUCY

Earlier this year, in the spring.

There is an awkward silence.

LUCY (CONT'D)

I tried to get in touch with you,
apparently you got rid of your cell
phone?

MARTHA
 
I lost it.

LUCY

You never got a new one?

MARTHA

I got used to not having it.

TED

Cocktail anyone?

LUCY

No thanks.

TED

Martha?

Martha shakes her head. Ted walks to the back of the boat. Martha has to stand up to let him pass through the narrow walk way. He brushes up against her as he squeezes by.

MARTHA
Was it a big wedding?

LUCY

No, about forty people. Mostly his
family.

MARTHA
(SMIRKING)

Did Aunt Dora come?

LUCY

Yeah.

MARTHA

Did she smoke like chimney and complain about everything.
24.



Ted laughs.

LUCY

She's not that bad.

MARTHA

You never had to live with her.

TED
 
You lived with Dora?

MARTHA

She lived with me after mom died.

TED
(TO LUCY)

Where were you?

LUCY
College.

Lucy picks up her Polaroid camera and frames up Martha.

LUCY (CONT'D)

Well I'm sure she'd love to know you're okay.

MARTHA
(SMILING)

She hates me.

LUCY
She doesn't hate you.
(BEAT)

Look at me.

MARTHA

I hate her.

Martha notices the camera and quickly turns away.

LUCY

Relax, I don't have any pictures of you.
(LUCY FOCUSES)
Jesus you're gorgeous. It's annoying.

Martha cracks a smile. Lucy snaps the shot.

LUCY (CONT'D)

There you go!

Lucy hands Martha the Polaroid, she shakes it.
25.



LUCY (CONT'D)
Don't shake it, that's a myth.

Martha looks deep in thought, she continues to shake the Polaroid.
 

MARTHA

Is it true married people don't fuck?

LUCY

What? No!

Ted walks back to the front of the boat and looks at Martha's ass as he passes. Martha is embarrassed. She stares at the Polaroid.


INT. LAKE HOUSE/TED AND LUCY'S BEDROOM - DAY

Martha sits on the bed watching Lucy go through her closet looking at old clothes. Lucy holds up a summer dress.

LUCY

Put this on.

MARTHA

You're kidding.

LUCY

Your clothes are disgusting Martha, just try it.

MARTHA
Why does it matter?

LUCY

It just feels good to put on something nice and comfortable.

Martha slips on the dress and a funny pose.

LUCY (CONT'D)

It looks good you little shit.

MARTHA
Whatever makes you happy mama bear.

LUCY

You're making fun of me and I think it looks really good.

They both laugh.
26.
 
EXT. LAKE HOUSE BACK PORCH - EVENING

Martha wears Lucy's dress. Ted, Lucy and Martha sit around the table eating dinner.

Ted picks at the food.

LUCY

It's no good?

TED

It's good, it's just, a bit dry.

LUCY

It's not dry.

Martha laughs. Ted starts laughing. Lucy tries it again.

LUCY (CONT'D)

It just needs a little salt. What are you laughing about I cooked for you your whole life.

MARTHA

You microwaved chicken nuggets and
fish sticks.

Ted and Martha continue to laugh. Lucy gets up from the table. She comes back with salt and dumps it on the food.


INT. LAKE HOUSE / TED AND LUCY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Ted and Lucy get ready for bed.

TED

She seems better today.

LUCY

Yeah. I wish I didn't have to go

No, I don't want to leave her alone.
(BEAT)
You'll be nice to her right?

TED

I'm always nice.
 
27.



LUCY

Right.

They laugh and kiss.


INT. MARTHA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Martha lies awake in bed staring at the ceiling. She is lost deep in thought.

CUT TO:


INT. FARM/DARK ROOM - NIGHT

MARTHA SLOWLY WAKES UP. SHE IS LYING ON HER STOMACH ON COLD CEMENT. THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF CANDLES ON THE FLOOR. SHE IS DISORIENTED AND FEELS SOMEONE ON TOP OF HER. SHE TURNS BACK TO LOOK BUT IT'S HARD TO MOVE. SHE CATCHES A GLIMPSE OF PATRICK, LEANING OVER HER DRIPPING SWEAT. PATRICK IS AGGRESSIVELY HAVING SEX WITH HER FROM BEHIND.


INT. FARM HOUSE/SMALL DARK ROOM - NIGHT

Martha seems like she has been drugged, she has a white robe draped around her. Katie consoles her and makes her drink water.

KATIE

I know you feel like something bad just happened Marcy May, but you have to trust me, that was not bad, it was truly good. We've all been in this situation, and we wouldn't all still be here if what happened in that room was bad. We all love each other very much, we are all together on this, you have to trust us.
(BEAT)

Do you believe me?

Martha nods.


INT. FARM HOUSE/ BEDROOM - LATER

Zoe and Martha share a single mattress on the floor in a
 

small dark room. Martha is still wrapped in the robe, she is still dazed.
28.



ZOE

You're so lucky, I'd give anything to have my first time again.

MARTHA

Really?

ZOE

Yeah, it's so special.

MARTHA

I can't remember anything, I just woke up on the floor and felt this pain -

ZOE

That's the cleansing. It's good. It means it's working if you can't remember things. You're cleansing yourself of the past and the toxins.

Martha is distant.

ZOE (CONT'D)

You need to share yourself, don't be so selfish.

MARTHA

I'm not.

ZOE

So smile then, enjoy this amazing night.
It only happens once.

Zoe rests her forehead against Martha's forehead. They curl up together in a very intimate way.

Martha smiles. Zoe kisses her on the lips. Martha is caught off guard. She laughs. They have a second peck on the lips before closing their eyes to sleep.


EXT. FARM - DAY

The group sits around listening to Max finish playing a song. Everyone claps for him. Patrick, who sits in the back, stands up and walks up to the stage. Everyone gets excited.
 

He tunes his guitar.

PATRICK
This one's called Marcy's song.
29.



Martha sits in the back listening. Everyone turns around to look at her. She watches on as Patrick begins to play.

The song is a beautiful, intense and haunting folk song. The whole group is entranced. Martha is mesmerized by him.

PATRICK (CONT'D)

Well she, she's just a picture.
Who lives on my wall
Well she, she's just a picture

And the reason, reason, reason it is so small.

With a smile so inviting and a body so tall, She, she's just a picture Just a picture
THAT'S ALL

Well you stand there, stand there with the nightshade,

Her dripping ripping down your hands And you ask me, ask me about the

LIGHTNING

And the lady, lady, lady she understands It's a dream for the future and the water for the sands

And the strangeness is wandering Through many callin' lands


INT. LAKE HOUSE KITCHEN - DAY

Ted walks into the kitchen.

Martha is on her hands and knees scrubbing the kitchen floor.

Ted gets a six pack out of the fridge. He cracks a beer and drinks it.

TED

What are you doing?
 
MARTHA

Cleaning.
(BEAT)

I thought I'd help out more.

TED

Alright. I'm going to take the boat out, do you want to come?
30.



MARTHA

Is Lucy coming?

TED
She had to run to the city.

MARTHA

Oh.

TED

I'll teach you how to drive the boat, come on.

MARTHA

It's okay.

TED
Come on.


EXT. BOAT - DAY

Ted drives the boat with a beer in his hand. He moves over and motions for Martha to take the wheel. Ted slowly lets go and moves over so she can take the helm. They brush up against each other. Martha is driving the boat. She bounces up and down like an excited little girl.


EXT. BOAT - LATER

Martha and Ted sit on the back of the boat. Ted gets a beer out of the cooler.

TED

You want one?

Ted hands her a beer. She stares at the beer and hesitates before taking a giant chug.
 
TED (CONT'D)

Beautiful day.

MARTHA
Yeah.

TED

How have things been with you and Lucy?

MARTHA
Fine.
31.



TED
Is it strange to spend time together?

MARTHA

No. Why?

TED

It's been a long time.

MARTHA

I don't know, it's normal I guess. She hasn't changed much.

Martha takes a swig of her beer.

MARTHA (CONT'D)

Where is she?

TED

At the doctor.

MARTHA

Why?

TED

She's getting a check up.
(BEAT)

We're trying to have a baby.

Martha laughs to herself. The beer is affecting her.

TED (CONT'D)

What?

MARTHA

I can't imagine it Lucy holding a child.
 
TED

Why?

MARTHA
She wouldn't know what to do with it.
(BEAT)

Do you want a baby?

He gets up and opens two more beers.

TED

I want what Lucy wants.
(SMILING)

If she's happy, I'm happy.

He hands one to Martha and sits down again.
32.



MARTHA
(SMILING)

So you're unhappy!

Ted laughs.

TED

No. She's good. She's relieved to have you back. You had her worried.

MARTHA

Why?

TED

You disappeared. You haven't called in two years!

MARTHA

I lost track I guess.

TED

It's good to let people know where you are Martha. People worry.

MARTHA

I didn't think Lucy would worry about me.

TED
Well, she did.

There is another awkward silence. They both drink their beer.
 

MARTHA

Can I go swimming?

TED

You don't need to ask.

Martha takes off her clothes. She is wearing a bikini that Lucy gave her. It does not quite fit. The bathing suit sags and top of her ass shows. Ted tries not to look.

THE CAMERA FOLLOWS HER AS SHE DIVES UNDER WATER.


EXT. FARM SWIMMING HOLE - DAY

Martha brings her head above water and she is with a group of people from the farm swimming in a swimming hole.
33.



Martha watches as Watts jumps off the cliff into the water.
Everyone cheers him on. Patrick swims up behind Martha.

PATRICK

You jump yet?

MARTHA

No.

PATRICK

Go on.

Watts swims by and guides her out of the water.

Watts and Martha ascend up a narrow dirt path to the top of
a
rock face.

WATTS

You ready?

MARTHA

I can't.

WATTS

Sure you can.

Watts jumps. Martha stands alone at the top of the cliff
 
naked.

Everyone is looking up at her cheering her on. She builds up the courage and jumps.

She hits the water, everything goes dark. The frame fills with tiny bubbles, she comes up for air exhilarated. She continues to swim, the camera follows her under water. The darkness of the water makes the screen go black.


INT. FARM HOUSE - NIGHT

The hallway is dark, the space is unclear. Martha walks down a hallway and we learn it's the farm house. She walks into Patrick's room. She get's into bed with him and curls up in his arms and falls asleep. She looks safe and happy. He welcomes her, the room looks warm and comforting.

CUT TO:
34.




INT. LAKE HOUSE/MARTHA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Martha sleeps. THUMP. Something hits the roof. Martha wakes up. THUMP, ROLL. Martha sits up and listens. She waits in anticipation. THUMP.


INT. LUCY AND TED'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Martha walks down the dark hallway and slowly opens the door to Ted and Lucy's room.

Ted and Lucy are having sex. Martha watches for a moment, then creeps into the room and quietly curls up on the edge of the bed.

Lucy does not see Martha. Ted does not say anything, he continues to have sex with Lucy. His motion becomes harder, Lucy opens her eyes and Ted jumps up.

LUCY
(STARTLED)
What? What?

Ted gestures to Martha.
 
LUCY (CONT'D)

Martha, what are you doing?

MARTHA
Nothing!

Ted turns on the light. He sits on the edge of the bed.

LUCY

Jesus, you can't just come in like that.

MARTHA

Sorry.

Martha gets up to leave.

LUCY

God damn it, what's wrong?

Martha stops and stands facing the door.

MARTHA

It's been hard to sleep alone.

TED

All you do is sleep.
35.



Martha goes to leave again.

LUCY
(TO MARTHA)

Stay, just stay.

Martha comes back and sits on the bed.

LUCY (CONT'D)
(UPSET)

Why would you think it was okay to come in like that?

MARTHA

I don't know. It's a big bed, you guys were on the other side.

LUCY

You can't come into our room when we're having sex, that's not normal! It's private.
 
MARTHA

Sorry.

LUCY
Don't apologize, I just want you to
understand why it's not okay.

MARTHA

Okay.

LUCY

Do you?

MARTHA

Yeah.

LUCY

Well?

MARTHA

Because it's privte and it's not normal.

Lucy can see something is really wrong.

LUCY

Just lie down Martha.

Martha lies in Lucy's lap. Lucy is uncomfortable with the contact, she pushes Martha's head onto a pillow.
36.



TED

This is just brilliant.

Ted stands up and puts on his sweatpants and walks out.
Martha closes her eyes.

CUT TO:


INT. FARM HOUSE/PATRICK'S ROOM - EARLY MORNING

Martha wakes up in Patrick's room, he is gently having sex with her. She doesn't enjoy it but she doesn't stop him.


INT. LAKE HOUSE LIVING ROOM - MORNING

Ted is half asleep on the couch. Lucy sits to wake him.
 

Martha is lying in their bed listening to them through the cracked doorway.

LUCY

I'm sorry you slept out here. Thanks for being patient.

TED

I don't have much choice do I?

LUCY

I just want to make sure she's okay.

TED

I get two weeks a year to come out here and try to relax before I have to go back to work!

LUCY

I know.

TED

I am under so much pressure right now-

LUCY

I know you are.

TED

I have a month to get this building up and running or the bank takes it.

LUCY

That has nothing to do with Martha.
37.



TED

My point is, I don't need the extra
stress.

LUCY

I'm her only family. She needs to be able to depend on me right now.
(BEAT)

It's complicated Ted.

TED

As complicated as it might be, we can't just keep ignoring the fact that her behavior is fucking insane.
 
Martha pretends to go back to sleep.


EXT. LAKE HOUSE GARDEN - DAY

Lucy works in the garden. Martha walks over to help.

MARTHA

Do you ever hear things hitting the roof at night?

LUCY

No. Maybe it's the pine cones.
(BEAT)

Where did you pick up gardening?

MARTHA

We had a garden where I lived?

LUCY

You're good.

MARTHA
I'm good at some things.

LUCY

I know you are.

They continue to work. Lucy builds up the courage.

LUCY (CONT'D)

Was he ever physical with you?

MARTHA

Who?

LUCY

Your boyfriend.
38.



MARTHA

What do you mean?

LUCY

Did he ever, hit you?

MARTHA

No.

LUCY
 
You had a bruised ear, and when you

called me you were hysterical.

Martha feels her ear.

LUCY (CONT'D)

Are you sure?

MARTHA

Yes.

LUCY

You can tell me.

MARTHA

He never hit me.

Beat.

LUCY

I wish you felt more comfortable talking to me.

MARTHA

I do.

LUCY

So talk.

MARTHA

There's nothing to talk about. I had a boyfriend, he lied to me, I left. That's it, everything doesn't have to be a big
DEAL
