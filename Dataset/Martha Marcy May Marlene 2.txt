He swats it out of her hand and scolds her. After a moment he puts his forehead to her forehead and caresses her head.

KATIE
(TO MARTHA)
 
Don't stare!

Zoe walks back to the garden.

MARTHA

You okay?

ZOE

Yeah. He's right. I don't know why I'm so weak.

MARTHA

You're not. You'll quit.

An OLD BROWN CAR pulls into the driveway. A YOUNG GIRL, no more than fifteen years old gets out.

MARTHA (CONT'D)

Who's that?

KATIE

Her name's Sarah I think.

TWO WOMEN welcome SARAH and walk her into the house.

MARTHA

Just curious.

LUCY

There's a hiking trail, people leave their cars there all the time.


INT. GROCERY STORE - DAY

Lucy looks through produce. Martha takes the cart and runs down the isle with it. She picks her feet off the ground so she is riding on the cart. Lucy is amused.

Martha turns around and goes faster, flying all the way down the isle. A good looking YOUNG MAN walks into the isle. Martha almost hits him with the cart but she slams her feet on the floor and just misses him. Lucy runs up and takes the shopping cart back. Martha doesn't say anything, she just stares at him.

LUCY

Sorry.

YOUNG MAN

It's okay.

The young man walks down the isle. Martha watches him go.

LUCY

You're going to hurt someone.

Martha is distracted.

LUCY (CONT'D)

Can you go get me a large jug of water.

MARTHA

What's wrong with the tap?

LUCY

I like bottled.

MARTHA

It's a waste.

LUCY

Will you get it or not?
41.
 



INT. GROCERY STORE/REFRIGERATOR SECTION - CONTINUOUS

MARTHA

He was looking at me like he knew me.
(BEAT)

Did you say something to him?

LUCY

Like what?

MARTHA

I don't know, you tell me.

LUCY

MARTHA
Drive the car!


INT. LAKE HOUSE KITCHEN - DAY

Lucy is unpacking groceries. Ted enters. Lucy puts something in a cupboard. Ted takes it out and puts it in a different cupboard.

LUCY

I don't think we should have the party.

TED
It's labor day, we always have it.

LUCY

Things are just too stressful right now.

TED
I've already invited clients.

LUCY

I'm sure people would understand-

TED
They wouldn't.

LUCY

I just think it would be best.

TED

For who, Martha?

LUCY

For all of us.
 
TED

It's not an option! We're having the party.

LUCY

And that's the end of it, because you say so.
43.



TED

Yes!


INT. FARM HOUSE/WARDROBE - DAY

Martha shows Sarah a large walk in closet. Martha puts Sarah's clothes on a shelf with all the other clothes.

MARTHA

We share all of this, if it fits, you can wear it.

SARAH

Cool.

They walk into a small bedroom.

MARTHA

This is where we sleep. You can take any bed that's open or you can sleep downstairs.

They walk downstairs. And see another large bedroom.

SARAH

I'm hungry, can we eat?

MARTHA

We don't eat until the evening.

SARAH

Really?

At the bottom of the stairs, several make shift beds are laid out on the floor.

MARTHA

You'll get used to it. Your body doesn't need that much food. You're taught to overconsume.
 

There is a baby asleep in the crib.

SARAH
He's beautiful. Whose the mother?

MARTHA

Katie's, but we all help out.

SARAH
Is Patrick the father?
44.



MARTHA
Uh huh.

SARAH

They look just like him.
(BEAT)

All the kids here are boys?

Martha picks one up, she is very natural with him.

MARTHA

He only has boys.

SARAH
You're good with them.

MARTHA

You want to hold him?

SARAH
No Thanks.
(BEAT)

I don't have to take care of them do I?

MARTHA

Not if you don't want to. There are
plenty of jobs to be done.
(BEAT)

You'll find your role. It takes time for people to find their role in a new family.


EXT. FARM HOUSE - DAY

Martha walks with Sarah and Zoe across the courtyard and out into the field towards the woods.
 

ZOE
(TO MARTHA)

I called my dad today to ask for money.

MARTHA

Does Patrick know?

ZOE

He asked me to. Sometimes, if there's something we really need I'll call.

MARTHA

How was it?
45.



ZOE

Fine, they're not bad people.

MARTHA

Did he give you the money?

ZOE

Yeah. He thinks I'm on drugs.

MARTHA

Do you tell him you're not?

ZOE

No, that's why he gives it to me. I guess he'd rather pay for it than think I'm sucking dick for it.

SARAH

I've done drugs. Not a lot but I've tried everything pretty much, except heroin.

ZOE

It's good to try everything at least once. You find out who you are that way. What about drinking, do you drink?

SARAH

I have, but I don't.

ZOE

Good, we don't drink. It just makes you angry and less focused.

MARTHA
 

Don't get the wrong idea Sarah. We don't talk to our old families.

SARAH

I wouldn't call my Dad anyway, no matter how much he paid me.

Patrick and Watts walk out of the woods.

PATRICK
Hey.

MARTHA

Hi Patrick, Did you meet Sarah yet?

PATRICK
Sally, yeah.

CUT TO:

LUCY

Get some sleep.

MARTHA

Okay.

IN ONE LONG TAKE, WHILE WALKING FROM THE KITCHEN TO THE BEDROOM, THE GLASS OF WATER HAS CHANGED BACK TO THE GREEN DRINK MARTHA PREPARED WITH KATIE.


INT. FARM/SMALL DARK ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Martha enters her bedroom holding the green drink.

Sarah sits in a chair wearing a WHITE ROBE. The room is no longer Martha's bedroom at the lake, it is a small dark room at the farm.
47.



MARTHA

Oh, hi.

SARAH

Hi.

Sarah is nervous. Martha brushes Sarah's hair.

SARAH (CONT'D)
What do I have to do?

MARTHA

Nothing you don't want to. Drink this, it will help you relax.

Sarah takes a sip of a thick green drink. She gags.

MARTHA (CONT'D)

It's herbal. It's the start of your
cleansing.

Martha lifts the bottom of the glass to force it down.

MARTHA (CONT'D)

We've all done it so you know there's nothing to worry about.
 

SARAH

Do I have to wear this robe?

MARTHA
(WHISPERING)

I know it seems a bit silly, but it's a part of it.

Sarah looks very uncomfortable. She is getting light headed from the drink.

MARTHA (CONT'D)

You look amazing. It's your special night with him, enjoy it, you'll be great.

SARAH

Thanks.

Martha helps Sarah up and passes her through a door to the next room. She removes Sarah's robe and lays her on the ground. Martha shuts the door locking her in.

Martha lies down on the floor and curls up into a ball.

MARTHA

Shouldn't we start cooking?

LUCY

I just made some potato salad. Ted's cooking the fish.

MARTHA
 
I thought we were going to cook.

LUCY

We cooked last night.

MARTHA

Oh, yeah.

Martha is lost deep in thought.

MARTHA (CONT'D)

Do you ever have this thing where you can't tell if something's a memory or if it's something you've dreamed?

LUCY
Not really.

Beat.

LUCY (CONT'D)

Do you blame me for anything?

MARTHA

No.
(BEAT)

Like what?
49.



LUCY

I don't know.
(BEAT)

I'm just trying to figure out why we stopped talking.

MARTHA

I didn't think about it.

LUCY
Really?

MARTHA

We were far apart.

LUCY

Sometimes I wonder if, maybe I could have taken better care of you.

MARTHA
(MUMBLES)
 
The past doesn't matter.

LUCY

It does matter.

MARTHA

I took care of myself.

LUCY

I know you did. I think I could have done more though.

MARTHA

Stop it.

LUCY

Be honest with me, you never think about it?

MARTHA

No.

LUCY
You're not angry at me?

MARTHA

I know you don't think much of me but I knew what I was doing then and I still do.
50.



LUCY

No, Martha, I think the world of you, I'm just wondering if I should have come back and kept you in school and helped you go to college, you had so much potential.

MARTHA

I don't need your guidance, I never did. I'm a teacher and a leader, you just never let me be that but now I know I am, I know who I am.

LUCY

Teacher and a leader? What are you talking about? I always encouraged you to do more, but you shut me out.

Martha doesn't respond she drifts off into deep thought.
 
LUCY (CONT'D)

MARTHA-

MARTHA

Just because we're sisters doesn't mean we need to talk about everything that comes into your head.

TED (O.S.)
(YELLING)
Dinner's ready.


INT. LAKE HOUSE DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Ted, Lucy and Martha eat at the dinner table.

TED

So what are your plans Martha?

MARTHA

For what?

TED

Life.

MARTHA

I don't know.

TED

Are you thinking about what you can do for work?
51.



MARTHA

No.

TED

You're at an age where you need to start thinking about a career.

MARTHA

Why?

TED

It's a part of adult life.

MARTHA

There are other ways to live.
 
TED

Really?

MARTHA
Sure.

TED

Like what?

MARTHA

I don't know. People don't need careers, people should just exist.

Ted laughs.

LUCY

He's just saying we should start talking about what you're interested in. Maybe we can help you get some ideas together.

TED

I have moments when I would love to move to France and just exist but it doesn't work that way.

MARTHA

You can do that if you want to.

TED
It's not that simple.

MARTHA
(CAUTIOUSLY)

It's not your fault but you learned that success is measured by money and possessions. It's just not the right way to live.

52.



Lucy is floored by Martha's response.

TED

And what do you think the right way to live is? Being a hysterical mess and causing your family pain. You're eating my food and sleeping under my roof so watch your mouth. You're rude.

Martha, with a frightening streak of viciousness stands up to Ted.
 

MARTHA

You don't know anything about it.

Ted and Lucy are speechless. Martha leaves.


INT. LAKE HOUSE HALLWAY - NIGHT

Martha sneaks downstairs in the middle of the night. Ted and Lucy are asleep in their room. Martha picks up the phone and dials a number. A WOMAN picks up.

WOMAN

Hello...Hello.

EXT. FARM FIELD - DAY

Zoe, Martha, Sarah and MAX are shooting bottles in the woods.

MAX

Watts said I'm supposed to teach you how to defend yourselves but I think you're hopeless.

ZOE

I'm surprised your dumb ass even knows how to load it.

MAX

Please, I'm like Doc fuckin' Holiday.

Zoe shoots and hits a bottle. He comes up behind Zoe, wraps his arms around her, kisses her neck and gropes her breasts. She moves his hands away. Sarah watches on.

MAX (CONT'D)

God, you are so hot when you shoot, makes my willy hard.

Max takes the gun out of her hand and fires several shots. He misses the bottles.

ZOE

What happened Doc? I should be teaching you.

He loads another round, aims, shoots, and hits a bottle.

MARTHA
Alright, my turn.

Max wraps his hands around hers so she is firmly gripping the gun.
54.



ZOE
(PLAYFUL)

Alright Max, was this just an excuse to
 
grope Marcy.

MAX

I'm teaching her how to shoot.
Then you just squeeeeeeeeeze.

Patrick is walking towards them carrying a sac. Martha fires a few shots and misses.

PATRICK

Focus. Take a deep breath. Think about someone who wronged you. Feel it, feel how they made you feel in your stomach. Take a deep breath, feel it all moving out into your hands. Let it build. It's transferring to the gun, building in the gun. Now release.

She fires five powerful shots quickly, one shatters. A smile grows on martha's face.

PATRICK (CONT'D)
(SMILING)
Feels good right?

Martha nods. Patrick opens a sac and lets 2 cats out.

PATRICK (CONT'D)

Now try that.

MARTHA

What do you mean?

PATRICK

Shoot it.

MARTHA

They're living animals.

PATRICK

So, shoot Max then.

Patrick lifts Martha's hand so the gun is pointing at Max. Max is frozen, he smiles awkwardly.

PATRICK (CONT'D)

Go on!

Max is confused, he gets embarrassed.
55.
 

MAX

Fuck this.

PATRICK

Don't walk away from me Max.

Max stops. Martha drops the gun down to her waist.

PATRICK (CONT'D)

The cat has terminal cancer, it's in excruciating pain.

MARTHA

I can't.

PATRICK

Max has no substance, he's just here to free load and be around the girls but you're a teacher and leader, you just don't see it because no one let you believe it before me. You're a leader a Marcy, now prove it.

Martha is shook up. She does not fire the gun.

PATRICK (CONT'D)

The cat reminds you of some fluffy thing you think you used to love. You're holding on to some false emotion that stops you from doing what's right.

Zoe takes the gun out of Martha's hand. The gun goes off.
Martha and Max jump. Zoe shot the cat without blinking.
She hands the gun back to Martha.

PATRICK (CONT'D)

I could spend my life being selfish, living alone, using this gift for me but I've sacrificed myself to be what you all need me to be. You need to trust me.

MARTHA

I trust you.

PATRICK

Then you shouldn't need me to explain everything.

A gun shot goes off. They all look up. Max looks mortified, he has shot the other cat.
 
PATRICK (CONT'D)

What did you do?
56.



MAX

You said it was sick.

PATRICK

One of them was sick, Zoe knew which one it was!

Max tosses the gun and walks away.

MARTHA

You okay?

I'll probably leave this place soon
anyways.

MARTHA

Where are you going to go?

MAX

I got places. My cousin lives in Bennington, he said I could go up there and make like, $500 a week selling weed.

MARTHA

You don't want to do that.

MAX

I don't care what I do. I'm sick of all these rules.

MARTHA

Max, they're not rules. It's just common sense.

MAX

It feels like rules. They won't let me do anything. I can't even go on the house runs. I'd be great at taking shit.
 

MARTHA

It's not about taking shit.

MAX

Sounds like it's about taking shit to me.
57.



MARTHA

And that's why you don't get to come.
You just don't get it.
(BEAT)

You need to quit drinking.

MAX

I'm not drinking.

Martha takes the bottle out from under a hay bale.

MARTHA

You're still living with all the shit you carried out there. You're the only one, let it go.

MAX

I'll try.

MARTHA

No. You can't try. You have to stop. They love you, they just want you to be stronger.

MAX
I'm strong, they'll see.

Max leans up and tries to kiss her. Martha stops him. She hugs him instead.

MARTHA

LUCY

You can lose your temper at will but when I get pissed off, I'm being crazy or ridiculous! I couldn't possibly be mad for a reason.

Lucy gets undressed and gets in the shower.
 
TED

Are you accusing me of something? Because if you are, I'd like you to say it out loud so you can hear how absurd it sounds.

LUCY

Fuck you. I just want you to think about how walking in on that might make me feel.

Calm down, if you calm down no one will get hurt.

MAN

What do you want?
67.



PATRICK

We're not stealing, we don't want
 
anything.

MAN

Just get out.

PATRICK

We're just looking at the house. It's nice.
(BEAT)

We didn't realize you were home. We
wouldn't have come in otherwise.

MAN

Just Leave.

PATRICK

I would but I can't be sure you won't call the police.

MAN

I won't. You didn't take anything so just go, I just want my family to be safe.

PATRICK

Safe? Why wouldn't anyone be safe. Unless you call the police, everything will be fine.

MAN

Okay, I won't. You have my word, please just go.

Martha walk outside. Patrick just stands there, he won't leave. Katie and Zoe walk out of the other room and are standing behind the Man. They don't move. He feels surrounded.

MAN (CONT'D)

Get the fuck out of my house.

Martha looks back but the view is blocked by the door. No one knows what to do. The girls are looking to Patrick but he's not doing anything. Suddenly Katie lunges at the man and stabs him in the neck. Blood spurts out and she stabs him again in the ribs.

They all run out.
68.
 
INT. FARM BEDROOM/HALLWAY - NIGHT

Martha is in a small wood paneled room lying on a mattress. She is stunned.

She looks through the open door to see Katie and Watts washing in the bathroom.

Patrick enters the bedroom and sits on her bed with Martha. Martha closes her eyes pretending to sleep.

PATRICK

Look at me.

Patrick runs his hands through her hair.

PATRICK (CONT'D)

You okay?

MARTHA

Uh huh.

There is a long silence. Martha is clearly not okay.

PATRICK

You know that death is the most beautiful part of life, right? Death is beautiful because everyone fears death. And fear is the greatest human emotion of all because it creates complete awareness. When you're scared it forces you to be completely aware of your surroundings and the moment you're in. It brings you to NOW and that makes you truly present. And when you are truly present, that's nirvana, that's pure love. So, death is pure love.

MARTHA

Men are moving vehicles into the garage. Women are bringing the clothes inside off the clothes line. Martha is helping with the garden. There is a sense of urgency to close the farm.

Max is in the hayloft trying to close the loft door. He slips and falls 30 feet to the ground. Martha rushes over to him. He is in pain. Watts comes out of the barn.

MARTHA
We have to do something.

WATTS

He's fine. Right Max?

MAX

Yeah, I'm cool.

They help him up and he falls. He cant put pressure on his leg and he seems to have a concussion.
 
MARTHA

Watts!

There's nothing to do Marcy, you need to get inside. Max is strong, he'll be fine. Right?

MAX

Yeah, I'm good Marcy. Stop.

INT. FARM HOUSE BASEMENT - NIGHT

Everyone is sleeping. Max is curled up in the corner. Martha walks over to him and wakes him. There is vomit in the corner.

MARTHA

Do you feel alright? If you hit your head you shouldn't sleep.

MAX

I'm fine.

MARTHA

Do you know why we're down here?

MAX

No. Do you?

She shakes her head.
 

MARTHA

What do you think it was?

MAX

I don't know. It doesn't matter.
71.



MARTHA

Do you still think about leaving?

MAX

No. It's cool now, I don't really have anywhere to go. Why, would you?

MARTHA

No. I just wanted to see about you.

FADE IN:


EXT. FARM - EVENING

Katie rings the dinner bell. Martha walks out of the house holding a large pot of soup. She walks it through the courtyard into the shed where everyone gathers to eat dinner.

Everyone from the farm stops work and walks towards the shed. It looks like more people are there than before, there are several new faces in the crowd.


INT. FARM HOUSE - DAY

Martha is cleaning the house. The phone rings, she picks it up. A young girl's voice is on the other end.

MARTHA
Hello?

VOICE

Hi, is Watts there?

MARTHA

Who's this?

There is something written on the wall Martha reads.
Martha signals to a girl in the kitchen to go outside.
 
VOICE

Jane. Is Watts there?

MARTHA
Can I help you?

VOICE

Who's this?
72.



MARTHA

It's Marlene Lewis. What's your last name
Jane.

VOICE

Heller, sorry, do I have the right
number?

Martha writes JANE HELLER on a list of names on the wall.
Some of them have been scratched out.

MARTHA

I don't know, do you?

Watts comes inside.

MARTHA (CONT'D)
It's a Jane.

WATTS

Hey. How are you? Sure, yeah, let's do it, I'll be around there on Friday. No, that was my cousin Marlene, yeah, I'll see you in a bit then. Great, I'm glad you called.

Watts hangs up. He and Martha have a quiet exchange and Watts walks away.

WATTS (CONT'D)

Hey.

Martha just stands there quietly.


INT. FARM HOUSE KITCHEN - EVENING

Martha cooks with Katie.

Martha sneaks a bite of bread. Katie whacks her in the
 

ear with a wooden spoon. A slight ringing remains throughout the scene.

KATIE
Nothing till they're done. You know
better.

MARTHA

I know. Sorry Katie.

LUCY (O.S.)

Who's Katie?
73.




INT. LAKE HOUSE KITCHEN - NIGHT

Martha turns her head to see Lucy instead of Katie.
Martha is at the lake house cooking with Lucy.

MARTHA
What?

LUCY

Who's Katie?

MARTHA
Oh, nothing.

Beat.

MARTHA (CONT'D)

Lucy?

LUCY

Yeah.

MARTHA

Is this from the past or is this now?

LUCY

What?

MARTHA

I don't remember waking up this morning.

LUCY

Why don't you go sit down, I'll finish up.
 

Lucy hands water and some pills to Martha. Martha takes the pills, walks into the other room and collapses on the couch in front of the television.

Ted walks into the kitchen. Martha listens from the couch.

He reaches out and holds her hand.

TED
What's going on?

LUCY

Who the fuck knows.

TED
She needs to see someone.
74.



LUCY

I know.

TED

I'll start looking into places tomorrow.
We can arrange for her to be somewhere by
Wednesday.

LUCY

Places?

TED

I don't think she should stay with us anymore. We can't do anything for her when she's like this.

Lucy goes back to chopping.

LUCY

I don't want to talk about it anymore.

CUT TO:


INT. FARM/BEDROOM - DAY

Martha and Zoe sit in bed.

MARTHA

Zoe?
 
ZOE

Yeah.

MARTHA

I can't stop feeling terrible for that poor man.

ZOE

I know. It happens though, we're never really dead or alive, we just exist, so he's still existing, but it's in a parallel time. Just don't think about it, it's in the past.

Martha is upset with how cold Zoe is.


INT. FARM HOUSE BATHRROM - LATER

Martha sits in the bathroom, knees pulled up to her chest as she rests on the edge of the bathtub.
75.


Someone knocks at the door. She pretends not to be in there. There is another gentle know.

ZOE

Martha, it's me, can I come in?

Martha unlocks the door for Zoe. Patrick bursts in, slams the door and corners Martha and yells at her.

PATRICK

Haven't you learned anything?

MARTHA

I have.

PATRICK

I felt like we had a connection.

MARTHA
(DESPERATE)

We do!

PATRICK

That's not what you're showing me.

Patrick calms down. He sits.

PATRICK (CONT'D)
 

Maybe I asked too much from you too soon. You have potential but you're just not there yet. I'll expect less of you fro now on.

Martha is upset, like a trained animal, she runs back to his side, sits next to him and rests her head on his shoulder.

MARTHA
I'm sorry.

He runs his hand through her hair.

PATRICK

Shhh. It's okay.

He puts his hand on the inside of her thigh.

PATRICK (CONT'D)

You're my favorite, I won't lose you.

CUT TO:
76.




INT. LAKE HOUSE - NIGHT

Martha wakes up on the couch confused, she sees a man standing over her. She quickly pushes him up, jumps over tyhe back of the couch and runs away.

The man is Ted. He follows her, trying to calm her down but she is in a blind state of panic.

She runs to the stairs. He follows her. She trips. He goes to see if she is okay. She kicks him. He falls down the stairs.

The lights turn on. Lucy comes out of the bedroom to see Ted at the bottom of the stairs. She rushes over to him.

Ted gets up slowly.

LUCY

Are you alright?

Ted pushes Lucy off of him.

LUCY (CONT'D)
 
What the fuck happened?

TED

She kicked me down the stairs. Jesus
Christ, what's it going to take, Lucy.

Martha starts crying, she becomes hysterical. Lucy is irate, she runs up the stairs and confronts Martha.

LUCY
You could have killed him.

Martha backs away.

MARTHA

I was confused.

LUCY

About what, what are you so confused about?

MARTHA

I thought he was someone else.

Lucy's anger is building.
77.



LUCY

You thought he was someone else? What is wrong with you?
(BEAT)

I'm not doing this anymore, I'm not doing this anymore. I beat myself up over you for years and I'm sick of it, I'm sick of chasing you down and worrying about you. I need to move on.

MARTHA

I'm sorry.

LUCY

You need help Martha.

MARTHA

I know.

LUCY

What happened to you?

Martha shakes her head with a severe look of fear in her
 
eyes.

LUCY (CONT'D)

What happened to you?

MARTHA
(SCREAMING)

I don't know.

Lucy doesn't know what else to do, she can see Martha is too far gone.

LUCY

We're going to get you proper help.

There is a long moment of silence.

MARTHA

Are you going to send me away?

LUCY

I don't know how to help you anymore.

MARTHA
(PLEADING)

Please don't. Please don't.

LUCY

I can't help you.
78.



MARTHA

Please, I can't be alone, please.

LUCY

We're trying to start a family and I don't trust you to be here.

Lucy walks away.

MARTHA

Lucy?

LUCY

What?

Lucy stops at the bottom of the stairs.

LUCY (CONT'D)

What?
 

MARTHA

You're going to be a terrible mother.

Lucy freezes, she tries to stay calm but bursts into tears. There is a long, tense silence. Lucy dries her eyes.

LUCY

Do you have any money left?

Martha shakes her head.

LUCY (CONT'D)

Of course you don't.
(BEAT)

We'll make sure everything is taken care of.

Lucy walks away, Martha is frozen on the stairs.


INT. LAKE HOUSE - NEXT DAY

Martha walks through the house. All of the luggage is packed and sitting by the front door.

Ted sits on the couch eating a sandwich and drinking a beer.
79.




EXT. LAKE HOUSE BACK YARD - CONTINUOUS

It is an overcast, unusually cold Labor Day. Lucy works in the garden.

LUCY

Going swimming?

MARTHA

Yeah.

LUCY

It's a bit chilly.

MARTHA

I don't mind.

LUCY
 

I think we both said some things last night that we didn't mean.

MARTHA
Yeah.

LUCY

We scheduled an appointment for you
tomorrow morning.

Martha looks into the back of the flower bed and notices footprints.

MARTHA

What's it like there?

LUCY

It looks nice.

Martha turns and walks down to the water.

LUCY (CONT'D)

We're heading back to the city in about an hour. You'll be ready to go?

MARTHA

Yep.


EXT. LAKE HOUSE DOCK - DAY

Martha stands on the dock. She strips down to her underwear and dives in.
80.



Martha swims out into the lake. She drops under the water and out of sight, a burst of bubbles pop up to the surface. A few seconds pass by and she is not coming up.

Suddenly she breaks back through the water and gasps for air.

She looks around at the thick woods and a handful of nice homes that appear to be empty now. No one else is swimming.

Martha sees a scruffy MAN sitting on a neighboring dock, he seems familiar. He is in his mid twenties, his jeans are rolled up and his feet dangle in the water. His shirt is slung over his shoulder and he smokes a cigarette. He
 
looks directly at Martha. They make eye contact.

He finishes his smoke, throws the cigarette in the water, puts on his shirt and just sits there.

Martha swims back to the house.


INT. TED'S CAR - DAY

Martha sits in the back seat of Ted and Lucy's car. Ted drives and Lucy sits up front. They drive up the driveway and turn out onto the road. Ted and Lucy talk. Martha gets a concerned look on her face. Ted slams on the breaks.

TED

Jesus Christ.

LUCY

Are you okay?

TED
Yeah.

LUCY

Fucking idiot. What was he doing?

The MAN from the dock walks past the car. They almost hit him. As they drive away, Martha turns to see him get into the a brown car, start the engine and drive. The car drives behind Ted's car.

Martha looks forward for a long moment, then turns back again to see that he is still there.
81.


She is frozen with fear, she thinks about saying something but then stops herself. Instead she sits in silence.
