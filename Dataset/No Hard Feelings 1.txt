OVER BLACK
We HEAR a RUMBLE...  and it’s getting LOUDER
A TOW TRUCK
Coming at us, filling up the SCREEN
ANOTHER ANGLE
Montauk Tow painted on the door. We follow the truck as it moves past several sizable homes on an upscale street. It stops at the smallest house on the block.
A CHARMING COTTAGE
Nestled on a half acre of prime Hamptons real estate.
Landscaped with love.
THE TOW TRUCK
Reverses into the driveway, and backs up to a BLACK TOYOTA CAMRY with Uber/Lyft decals.
A long STINGER extends from the tow to the Camry’s chassis.
The DRIVER jumps out, secures an under hook to the chassis.
He hits a lever and the Camry is lifted off the ground.
THE FRONT DOOR
Flies open and MARGOT CHAPMAN, maybe 30, -- scrappy, impatient, a rascal, even -- bolts out of the house. She cinches her ratty bathrobe closed as she runs over.
MARGOT
Stop stop stop stop!
(to Driver)
Gary! What the fuck?!
Gary pauses the lift mechanism.
GARY
Court order for asset seizure. Gotta pay your property taxes, Margot.
MARGOT
No, this is a mistake. I’m
negotiating a payment schedule.
GARY
I guess they’re done negotiating.
2.
MARGOT
So they’re taking my car? I’m an Uber driver. I can’t pay off their fucking taxes just bartending.
GARY
Not my problem.
MARGOT
So you’re okay with these rich assholes coming to Montauk and building their summer palaces which then triples our property taxes? It’s all of our problem.
GARY
No, my problem is you went radio silent.
MARGOT
(beat)
...  Is that what this is about?
GARY
No. I also have a contract with the county. I’m just saying an explanation would’ve been nice for why I never heard from you again.
Gary presses the lever and the tow boom continues lifting the Camry onto the flatbed. Margot panics.
MARGOT
Wait! You’re right. Look, I was
scared, okay? The feelings I had
for you were just really intense.
So I ran. It was stupid. Can you
just stop for one second?!
He stops, turns to her. His face a mix of emotions.
GARY
Is that true?
MARGOT
Yes! Last night I was doing laundry and thought “I miss that fucker.”
GARY
Really?
MARGOT
Yes, really, ya big dummy.
3.
She punches him in the shoulder. He softens, but then behind Margot, a GORGEOUS GUY exits the house in his underwear and begins doing squats on the lawn. Gary’s face falls. Margot continues, unaware.
MARGOT (CONT'D)
I miss us! I miss hearing about
what the Jets are doing wrong and
what you would do differently if
you ran the team.
(then)
Just say my car wasn’t here. Please.
GARY
You’re a piece of work, y’know that?
Gary hits the lever, the Camry continues being lifted. Margot looks back, sees the Gorgeous Guy exercising.
MARGOT
Who, him? Oh, that’s just my cousin.
Gorgeous Guy waves at them.
GORGEOUS GUY
Buenos dias!
MARGOT
(to Gary, explaining)
He’s from Spain.
Gary ignores her, continues to secure the Camry.
MARGOT (CONT'D)
I swear on my life he’s my cousin.
Gorgeous Guy comes up from behind, nuzzles Margot’s neck and cups her breast. She gently pulls his hand off.
MARGOT (CONT'D)
Second cousin.
GARY
I wanted closure and I guess I got it.
MARGOT
(feels bad)
Gary, come on...  it was just sex.
GARY
Well now you can run from even more stuff.
(hits tow lever)
Since you don’t have a car.
4.
The Camry secured, Gary gets back in his truck.
GARY (CONT'D)
(starts truck up)
My sister was right about you.
You’re a bad person.
MARGOT
That bitch got arrested for elder abuse.
GARY
There’s something seriously wrong with you.
MARGOT
You think you’re perfect? You’re... 
(thinks)
... indecisive. Which is annoying.
(then)
Look, I’m sorry. Can I at least get a ride to the Claw? I’m bartending.
GARY
Hmmm. I just can’t seem to decide.
Gary drives off. Margot inspects the court order in her hand.
EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - LATER
Margot, in a restaurant polo, ROLLER BLADES to work, taking up much of the road. A line of cars behind her HONKS. She waves them off.
MARGOT
Go around!
EXT. STRIP MALL - STARBUCKS - LATER
Gary’s truck parked off to the side, the Camry still on it.
Margot ROLLS past and exits the frame. After a beat... 
Margot ROLLS BACK INTO THE FRAME.
She pats her pocket, pulls out her keychain, the FOB still attached. She presses the fob, hears the DOUBLE BEEP. She thinks for a long moment, then, glances to make sure no one’s looking... 
INT. STARBUCKS - SAME
Gary steps to the front to order.
5.
GARY
Gimme one of the banana breads. Actually, wait. Lemon loaf. No, wait... 
In the b.g. Margot opens the truck door and crawls in.
EXT. TOW TRUCK - SAME
Margot randomly presses different buttons and levers.
INT. STARBUCKS - SAME
Gary stares at the pastries as the barista waits, impatiently.
GARY
Yeah, let’s go with the banana bread.
In the b.g., the flatbed begins lowering.
EXT. TOW TRUCK - SAME
Margot now frantically removing the pins from the wheels. She slips inside the Camry.
INT. CAMRY - CONTINUOUS
Margot starts the engine. Music BLASTS. She turns it down, then shifts in reverse, and...  nothing. She SLAMS the gas.
INT. STARBUCKS - SAME
As the barista hands Gary a croissant, we HEAR a loud SCREECH. Gary turns to see --
A PLUME OF SMOKE RISING from the tires spinning in place as the Camry strains to break free from the under hook.
I/E. CAMRY - SAME
A small crowd has gathered to watch this mechanical tug of war. Phones are raised, recording. Gary BOLTS out.
GARY
What the hell are you doing?!
MARGOT
Trying to save my house, Gary!
6.
He gets to the truck and hits a lever. The Camry immediately goes perpendicular, hanging like a captured shark, with only its front tires on the ground.
MARGOT (CONT'D)
Noooo!
Margot turns the wheel and SLAMS THE PEDAL causing the Camry to TWIST AND FLIP OVER. The Crowd gasps.
A beat, then the door opens and Margot falls several feet to the ground. She stands on her rollerblades, surveys the crowd, the damage, and Gary.
MARGOT (CONT'D)
You know what, just tow it.
EXT. COURT HOUSE STEPS - DAY
Margot, rollerblades slung over her shoulder, exits with her PUBLIC DEFENDER, 50s, rumpled suit, ponytail.
PUBLIC DEFENDER
What were you thinking, Margot?
MARGOT
I don’t know. I just reacted.
PUBLIC DEFENDER
One more infraction and you lose your license.
MARGOT
Lotta good a license does when I
don’t have a car.
She hands him the court order, he scans it as she takes off her shoes and changes into her rollerblades.
MARGOT (CONT'D)
My mom left me that house. It’s
paid off. Can they do this?
PUBLIC DEFENDER
If you haven’t paid your taxes they can. Good news is you have until September first. That’s all summer. You’ll pay it off.
MARGOT
Not without a car, man.
Margot rollerblades away.
7.
INT. LOBSTER CLAW - DAY
An open-air restaurant/bar on the beach. Margot cuts lemons as she preps the bar. A WALL STREET type, 50’s, sunburnt, enters talking loudly on his phone. Margot clocks him, goes back to cutting lemons.
WALL STREET
(on phone)
Yeah the new place is right on the water, you gotta come out.
As he comes up to the bar, he shouts his order to Margot.
WALL STREET (CONT'D)
G&T with lime.
MARGOT
We don’t open until noon.
He glances at a clock on the wall -- 11:57.
WALL STREET
It is noon.
MARGOT
See the little hand? It’s 11:57.
Annoyed, he throws a TWENTY in the tip jar.
WALL STREET
Now what time is it?
She looks at the clock.
MARGOT
11:57.
He stares at her, uncomprehending. He reaches in the jar to grab his tip back. With cobra quickness, she grabs his wrist. As they grapple... 
MARGOT (CONT'D)
Why don’t you go wait in your boat and
I’ll sound the foghorn when we’re open.
WALL STREET
What the hell is your problem?
The small struggle is finally broken up by the owner, FERN, 50s, lesbian, salt of the earth.
8.
FERN
Hey, hey! C’mon, Margot. Sir, I can make that drink for you.
WALL STREET
Fuck this.
(exiting)
You need to fire her.
FERN
I’ve tried. She won’t leave, Sir.
Fern turns to Margot, pissed.
FERN (CONT'D)
You can’t start the season like
this. I don’t love these people
either, but they keep the lights
on. Summer’s when we make all our
money. You know this.
MARGOT
I know. I’m sorry, Fern.
FERN
(comforting)
You know what helps me?
Margot look at her, hopeful.
FERN (CONT'D)
Folding napkins.
(then, deadpan)
So why don’t you go help Sara with that.
INT. LOBSTER CLAW - LATER
Margot folds napkins. Her co-worker and friend, SARA (30s, extremely pregnant) scrolls Craigslist on her phone.
SARA
This car’s only a thousand. No that’s just for tires.
MARGOT
Great. I can’t even afford tires.
SARA
Here’s one without tires.
MARGOT
We’ve looked everywhere, we’re not gonna find anything.
(MORE)
9.
MARGOT (CONT'D)
(then)
And I’m losing hundreds of dollars every day I’m not driving.
VOICE (O.S.)
You could sell your kidney.
REVEAL Sara’s husband, HENRY, 35, in a charter boat jacket, sits behind them, whittling. He has a beer in front of him.
HENRY
Or your hair, your eggs, your
plasma. Our bodies are cash cows.
People don’t understand that. I
read about a guy in Cambodia who
sold his feet.
SARA
(re belly)
Henry. I can feel our children
getting dumber.
HENRY
I’m trying to help. I’m a solutions orientated person.
(to Margot)
You should rent it out.
MARGOT
No. I can’t stand the thought of these rich fucks living in my house.
HENRY
I meant for porn shoots.
SARA
Holy shit. Read this.
MARGOT
(takes it, reads screen)
“Free Buick. This is going to sound strange, but our son is starting college in the fall and we want to help him. He’s a wonderful young man, extremely smart but socially very shy. He’s never had a girlfriend. We’re looking for an attractive, kind and intelligent woman, 20-22, to “date” him and boost his confidence before he leaves for college in the fall. In exchange, we’ll give you a free, 2013 Buick Regal, clean, rust-free, 40k miles. Serious inquires only.”
(MORE)
10.
MARGOT (CONT'D)
(then)
“Date” is in quotes.
HENRY
I bet that means sex.
SARA
My husband the code breaker.
MARGOT
This has to be a joke, right?
HENRY
Have you seen these helicopter
parents? They do everything for
their kids. This is just the next
logical step.
SARA
But if it is real... 
They consider it for a beat. Henry is incredulous.
HENRY
You guys aren’t serious? Margot
won’t even rent out her house so
why would she rent out her... 
y’know?
SARA
Henry, the adults are talking.
HENRY
What? Oh, because I’m a man I can’t express an opinion on this?
MARGOT	Exactly.	SARA
Yeah.		*
Fern enters, takes a tray of folded napkins, turns to Henry:
FERN
Yeah, and you have a Roadrunner
tattoo covering your entire back.
Don’t think you should be telling
anyone what to do with their body.
Fern leaves.
HENRY
That’s rude.
(then)
And Margot, really?
11.
MARGOT
(shrugs)
I have sex with random guys all the time. I’d love if they gave me a Buick when it was over.
HENRY
I guess... 
SARA
Babe, you don’t know this, but women have sex for reasons you can’t even imagine. Do you know how much “just get it over with sex” I’ve had with you?
Henry gasps. Then nods.
MARGOT
I had sex once to get out of playing
Settlers of Catan.
SARA
I had sex once because I didn’t
want to commute the next day.
MARGOT
I had sex once because I wanted to go to New Hampshire.
SARA
I had sex once on a first date because I thought the guy was gonna kill me.
HENRY
Who?
SARA
You.
HENRY
(charmed by this)
You thought I was going to kill
you? I thought you were going to
kill me, haha.
SARA
(to Margot)
Still might.
12.
I/E. OLD CARGO VAN - NIGHT
Sara pulls up to Margot’s house, takes Margot’s hand. Henry’s in the back seat.
MARGOT
I just know my mom would’ve wanted me to fight to keep this house.
SARA
I say you do what you need to do.
MARGOT
Hey, it would be the fastest way to get a car.
HENRY
Yeah, he’ll cream his shorts as
soon as he sees you. Then you can
drive right home haha.
Sara glares at her husband.
HENRY (CONT'D)
No, because he’s eighteen, not
because Margot’s so hot.
Another glare. Henry sighs, gives up.
MARGOT
Thanks for the ride.
(inside joke)
I love you, Gus.
SARA
Love you, Gus.
Margot exits the van. Henry unbuckles to move up front.
SARA (CONT'D)
No, you stay back there.
EXT. MARGOT’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
Margot, exhausted, opens her front gate. It SQUEAKS. She opens it closes it several times.
LATER
Margot, pen flashlight in her mouth, fixes the hinge. She swings the gate to test it. Satisfied, she goes inside.
13.
INT. MARGOT'S HOUSE -- KITCHEN - LATER
The house is furnished with little money but lots of care.
Photos of Margot and her mother throughout the years.
Margot cooks some rice, goes through her mail -- mostly bills with "PAST DUE" stamped on them.
LATER
Margot eats a simple dinner alone at her kitchen table.
INT. MARGOT’S HOUSE - MORNING
Various shots.
-	Margot has her tools out, replaces a doorknob.
-	Margot carefully repaints a window frame.
-	Margot prunes carnations from her garden.
-	Margot mows her lawn, stops the lawnmower and takes in the house, thinks... 
EXT. MODERN BEACH HOUSE - DAY
Margot roller blades up to the end of the driveway. She looks up at the steep incline to the gate, sighs.
EXT. DRIVEWAY - MOMENTS LATER
Margot struggles up the driveway, going more sideways than up. The LANDSCAPERS watch dispassionately.
MARGOT
Jesus fucking Christ.
Margot grabs hold of a branch for support. She turns to see:
The garage is open and inside is -- a 2013 emerald green BUICK REGAL. Margot stares at her life raft.
The branch SNAPS and she begins rolling backwards.
MARGOT (CONT'D)
Fuck nooooo!
14.
EXT. FRONT GATES - LATER
Margot marches up to the gate, her blades in her hands. She’s sweaty and one knee is skinned. She presses the speaker.
MARGOT
Hello? Allison? It’s--
A moment later the gates part to reveal a modern structure of glass, wood, and steel.
Waiting at the front door are ALLISON and LAIRD GLADWELL, a well-tanned, white couple in their early 50s. They both wave.
ALLISON
Margot, hi!
MARGOT
Hello.
She hugs Margot like a long lost friend.
MARGOT (CONT'D)
Oh. Okay.
ALLISON
Thank you so much for coming. This is my partner, Laird.
Laird, barefoot, in linen pants, puts his arm around Allison.
LAIRD
It’s a true honor. Welcome.
ALLISON
(to Laird)
She’s pretty, right?
LAIRD
Yes, very pretty.
Margot smiles as they talk about her like she’s not there.
HALLWAY
Allison and Laird lead Margot down a corridor with floor to ceiling windows. Tasteful sculptures and modern art. The faint sound of NPR can be heard.
A HISPANIC WOMAN works a stain on the rug nearby.
LAIRD (CONT'D)
Inez, no interruptions.
15.
ALLISON
(to Margot, explaining)
Inez helps us with the house.
LAIRD
She’s family.
She nods at Margot, returns to scrubbing.
SUN ROOM
A spectacular view of the Atlantic. Margot sits in an enormous chair across from Allison and Laird. She dabs at her sweat with a napkin.
A MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN in athletic wear enters with a beautiful spread: grapes, crackers, cheeses. She sets the tray down on the coffee table and exits. Margot eyes the spread hungrily.
ALLISON
Thanks, Bonnie!
(then)
Bonnie helps us with the house.
LAIRD
She’s like an organizational
genius. She’s family.
ALLISON
So, Margot, tell us about yourself.
Where are you from?
MARGOT
Here, actually. Born and raised.
ALLISON
A local! Well I’m jealous. You get to live in paradise all year long.
LAIRD
(points to masonry)
See these stones? All local.
MARGOT
I thought I recognized a few of them.
A beat. They realize she’s kidding.
ALLISON
She’s funny!
Margot makes a silly face, spreads some cheese across a cracker, inhales it.
16.
MARGOT
Wow, that is some good cheese.
LAIRD
Feel free to bring some home with
you. We’ll have Inez wrap it up.
ALLISON
So, Margot, I meant to ask on the
phone: how old are you?
MARGOT
I know you’re looking for someone early to mid twenties. I’m slightly older.
ALLISON
How old, may I ask?
MARGOT
Well, I just turned twenty-nine.
ALLISON
When?
MARGOT
Last year.
LAIRD
So you’re twenty-nine?
MARGOT
Yes, last year.
Allison and Laird share a confused look.
ALLISON
And how old are you right now?
MARGOT
One more year older.
LAWYER
So thirty?
MARGOT
Yeah. Thirty-one.
Another look between them.
ALLISON
That’s older than we were thinking.
17.
MARGOT
May I be frank? I assume I’m here because you haven’t found anyone yet. And the reason you haven’t found anyone is because young girls are idiots. It’s not their fault, they’re young. But this is your son we’re talking about. What you need is someone who looks like a peer, but is mature enough to handle this with the tact and sensitivity the situation requires.
ALLISON
(beat, then)
Good answer. You’re good.
LAIRD
And normal. It’s been really hard
to find someone normal.
ALLISON
The economy’s too damn strong.
LAIRD
We’re just worried about our son.
He’s such a wonderful young man:
sensitive, loving, extremely
bright.
ALLISON
He’s brilliant. He’s going to
Princeton in the fall.
MARGOT
Heard of it.
ALLISON
The only problem is he’s never
dated anybody. We’re worried he’s
falling behind...  socially.
LAIRD
And he’s always on his phone. It
makes him anxious and depressed.
LAIRD (CONT'D)
He’s unhappy.
ALLISON
Laird was unhappy when he was
Percy’s age.
18.
LAIRD
I was.
ALLISON
And you know what helped him? We
started “dating” right before
college -- and Laird thrived.
LAIRD
Thrived.
ALLISON
And that’s what we want for Percy.
He just needs a little nudge.
Margot nods as she inhales another salami/cheese cracker.
MARGOT
(mouth full)
So how does this work? Honor system?
LAIRD
That. And we know his passcode.
MARGOT
And he’s not gay?
ALLISON
We’ve seen his internet history.
It’s graphic, but it’s not gay.
LAIRD
We were hoping he was gay. It would explain things. He’s an introvert.
ALLISON
And we’ve tried everything: Setting him up with girls at school, family friends’ kids. Nothing’s worked.
LAIRD
We’re just really worried about
him. We can’t send him off to
college like this. We just can’t.
His voice trails, he gets emotional. Allison takes his hand.
MARGOT
That’s why you called a professional.
(immediately)
Not a “professional.” Just a woman who needs a car.
(then)
(MORE)
19.
MARGOT (CONT'D)
Speaking of which -- not to look a
gift horse in the mouth -- but does
it have to be a Buick?
LAIRD
It’s just what Dad drove. He refused to buy German or Japanese cars.
MARGOT
Because of the war?
LAIRD
No, he hated foreigners. He’d shout “they come here and take what’s ours!”
Margot looks around the fancy living room.
MARGOT
I know the feeling.
(then)
I’m fine with money, too... 
ALLISON
Yeah, thing is, Laird’s a lawyer... 
LAIRD
(chuckles)
Yeah, that’s solicitation. But I think you’ll find the Buick is of equal or greater value for services provided.
MARGOT
(nods)
...  Cool.
ALLISON
As for protection-
MARGOT
Oh, I’m on the pill. Or do you mean condoms? I’m all stocked up.
LAIRD
Then great! Just date Percy and the
Buick’s yours.
ALLISON
And get to know him. He’s a great kid.
LAIRD
But also date him. Date him hard.
20.
ALLISON
Laird.
MARGOT
I’ll date his brains out.
LAIRD
(to Allison)
She gets it.
Something off screen catches Margot’s eye.
MARGOT
Is that him?
She points at a FRAMED FAMILY PICTURE on the wall. Allison and Laird have their arms around PERCY (skinny, anime t-shirt, glasses) in a helicopter over the Grand Canyon.
MARGOT (CONT'D)
Oh yeah, I see the resemblence.
LAIRD
He’s adopted.
MARGOT
Still a resemblence.
ALLISON
We couldn’t have children, so Percy’s been a blessing for us.
Margot puts her hands over her heart, touched.
LAIRD
Oh, and -- I don’t see this
happening -- but if Percy meets
someone the “organic” way... 
ALLISON
We always prefer organic.
LAIRD
What I’m saying is: the deal’s off if you’re beaten to the punch.
MARGOT
Well. I better get to work then.
Allison and Laird laugh, but Margot’s not kidding.
MARGOT (CONT'D)
(looks around)
Sooooo is he up in his room, or... 
21.
LAIRD
Oh, no. No, he’s not home.
ALLISON
Yes, he can’t know about this.
LAIRD
He would be destroyed, and it would obviously defeat the purpose of helping his confidence.
MARGOT
Of course.
ALLISON
Let’s bring up Percy’s summer
calendar.
They both get on their phones. Margot makes a face -- he has a calendar?
LAIRD
(off phone)
From 10 to 6 he volunteers at the
shelter.
LAIRD (CONT'D)
We thought you could go in there like you’re looking to adopt a dog.
MARGOT
That is so sweet. I love dogs. I
can’t wait to meet Percy.
Inez appears with a satchel of cheese. Allison and Laird share a smile, stand.
LAIRD
(extends his hand)
Very nice to meet you, Margot.
There’s your cheese.
MARGOT
(surprised)
The cheese means we’re done?
ALLISON
(warmly)
We’ll be in touch.
Over MELANCHOLY ACOUSTIC GUITAR MUSIC... 
22.
INT. PERCY’S BEDROOM - DAY
A ship-in-a-bottle and an Incredible Hulk figure on his shelf. Daredevil and Green Lantern comics sequentially organized. A framed “Dragon Ball Z” animation cell on beside a poster of Odd Future. A Princeton sweatshirt hangs off a chair. Two pill bottles on his nightstand.
In the middle of it all is Percy. He lies on his covers, staring at the ceiling.
INT. KITCHEN - DAY
Percy sits at the kitchen table, mindlessly scrolling on his phone. Allison serves him a sandwich, the corners cut off.
EXT. SAG HARBOR BAY - DAY
Laird pilots the boat while Percy looks at his phone.
INT. PERCY’S BEDROOM - DAY
-	Percy plays heavy metal on his electric guitar. He’s okay.
-	Percy plays a video game.
-	Percy watches TikTok. Two GIRLS in boxers and t-shirts do a choreographed dance.
EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY
Percy, in a helmet and neon vest, cautiously bikes along the fog line, wincing as a car whooshes past.
EXT. BEST FRIENDS - PARKING LOT - DAY
Percy locks up his bike, heads inside. Beat. He quickly doubles back to make sure that his bike is locked, giving the bike lock numbers another cautionary scramble.
INT. BEST FRIENDS - EARLY EVENING
An upscale animal shelter. Fancy dog food and toys line the walls. Lots of barking.
Margot enters, dressed to impress in a revealing outfit. She spots Percy giving a wiener dog a scalp massage. He notices Margot, quickly looks away.
23.
She smiles and starts towards him when a chunky, confident man of 20, CRISPIN, sprints over in a “I RESCUED MY BEST FRIEND” shirt.
CRISPIN
Hi, can I interest you in some unconditional love? Looking for something to slobber on you?
MARGOT
(off Percy)
Can he help me?
CRISPIN
He mostly works with the dogs. I
deal with people.
MARGOT
You have a weird energy. I want him.
Rejected. But he’s used to it, quickly recovers.
CRISPIN
Percy! Can you help this lady?
Margot frowns at being called “lady.” Percy nods, nervous.
Margot struts over, gives him a flirty smile.
MARGOT
Well hello there.
PERCY
How can I help you, ma’am?
Margot smiles, grits her teeth.
MARGOT
I love your shirt.
Percy looks down at his anime shirt - a ghastly demon with a sword exploding out of its face.
PERCY
... . Thanks.
MARGOT
Really cool cartoon.
PERCY
It’s not a cartoon. It’s anime.
MARGOT
Yeah, animated. That’s what I said.
(then)
Mind if I touch your wiener?
24.
PERCY
...  What?
She points to the dog.
PERCY (CONT'D)
Oh. Yeah.
Margot bends down and pets the wiener dog. Percy nervously pulls out his phone, begins scrolling.
MARGOT
(flirty)
That doesn’t mean you can get on
your phone. I need your help.
PERCY
(puts phone away)
Sorry. Uh, what kind of dog are you looking for?
MARGOT
I wish I could save them all. Which is the most fucked up?
Percy thinks, then opens a nearby cage. Out comes a GERMAN SHEPHARD.
PERCY
This is Milo. He’s really sweet. He was a drug dog for the state police but got addicted to c-o-c-a-i-n-e.
MARGOT
Cocaine?
Milo goes nuts, barking and howling.
PERCY
Milo! No!
(to Margot)
If he hears the word he gets
triggered.
Percy struggles to put Milo back in the cage.
MARGOT
Sorry, Milo, I’m fresh out.
(clocks Percy’s side eye)
And I’m high on this beautiful
life. So which one do you think I
should adopt?
25.
PERCY
Not sure. I’d need to ask you a few questions first to make sure you’re a suitable candidate.
MARGOT
By all means. If you feel the need to take me in the back and inspect me.
PERCY
Not you specifically. We have to do it with everyone. It’s the rules.
MARGOT
(beat)
...  Cool.
INT. BEST FRIENDS - BACK OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
Pictures of happy owners and their new dogs hang on the wall.
Percy takes a seat at the desk. Margot sits across from him.
He pulls up the questionnaire on the laptop.
PERCY
(typing)
Margot. Chapman.
MARGOT
I should have a name tag right here.
She jiggles her breast. He doesn’t notice.
PERCY
Spouse?
MARGOT
Currently single. Thank god, too.
It’s more fun. You can be
spontaneous, y’know.
PERCY
(as he types)
Unmarried.
(then)
Children?
MARGOT
Too young. Having fun still.
Meeting new people. I love that.
26.
PERCY
(as he types)
Childless.
Margot frowns, her flirting is not working.
PERCY (CONT'D)
And why do you want to adopt a dog?
MARGOT
Because I can’t have dogs of my own.
(joke dies, quiet)
Kidding.
PERCY
(continuing)
What do you plan to do with the dog if you move?
MARGOT
I’m not moving.
PERCY
But what if you do?
MARGOT
I won’t. I’ve lived here my whole life. I love it here. I’m not going anywhere.
PERCY
Well if you’ve never done anything different, how do you know you won’t like something else better?
MARGOT
Is that on the questionnaire?
PERCY
Sorry. No. I didn’t mean to pry.
MARGOT
Pry. Pry me open. I promise I’ll
lay myself bare.
She gives some strong eye contact. Uncomfortable, he looks up at the clock.
PERCY
I should start closing up.
MARGOT
Awwww, but I have more questions.
What should we do?
27.
PERCY
You can come back another day.
MARGOT
Or I can give you a ride home and
we can keep talking?
Margot gives her best thousand watt smile. Percy considers.
CUT TO:
INT. BEST FRIENDS - MAIN AREA - CONTINUOUS
Margot and Percy breeze past Crispin at reception.
PERCY
Is it okay if I leave early?
MARGOT
(sweetly)
You can finish alone, right? Bet
you do it all the time.
CRISPIN
Uhhhh... 
MARGOT
Thanks.
They exit. Crispin is shocked.
CRISPIN
... . Okay then. Approved.
EXT. BEST FRIENDS - PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER
Margot and Percy approach Sara/Henry’s VAN. Percy stops in his tracks.
PERCY
This is your van?
ANGLE on the windowless pedophile van.
MARGOT
It is for tonight.
PERCY
There’s no windows.
28.
MARGOT
(winks)
More privacy.
Beat. Percy grows uncomfortable.
PERCY
Actually, I just remembered I rode my bike here.
He unlocks his bike. Margot opens the back of the van.
MARGOT
Plenty of room for it.
She takes it, throws it in the back.
MARGOT (CONT'D)
You can sit up front with me. Get in.
He just stands there.
MARGOT (CONT'D)
(smiles)
I won’t bite. Unless you want me to.
He cautiously gets in.
PERCY
Don’t bite me.
I/E. VAN - MOMENTS LATER
Foghat blares on the radio. Percy nervously fiddles with his lapbelt.
MARGOT
I mean yeah, whatever, I’ve been
with girls a couple times.
(singing along)
“Slow Ride, take it easy.”
PERCY
Where’s the rest of my seatbelt?
MARGOT
That is a lap belt. Just pretend you’re on an airplane. I’ll be your flight attendant.
PERCY
Why is the flight attendant flying the plane?
29.
MARGOT
Because I’ve killed the pilot and
taken the plane over. You’re my
hostage.
She takes a hard right turn.
PERCY
You didn’t signal.
MARGOT
Nobody signals.
PERCY
(looks around)
This isn’t the way to my house.
MARGOT
We’re taking the scenic route.
Percy looks in the back of the van: Harpoons, ropes, cages.
Might as well be torture equipment.
PERCY
Where are we going?
MARGOT
It’s a surprise.
Percy tenses, then covertly takes his phone out, begins texting “Kidnapped Help” to his parents. Margot snatches it.
MARGOT (CONT'D)
Gimme that! You guys and your phones.
Panic sets in. His face frozen in fear.
MARGOT (CONT'D)
(singing)
Move to the music!
She “sexy dances” while driving as she pulls into her driveway, turns off the car. She hears a faint rattle, looks over to see Percy, back turned to her, his arm moving up and down rapidly. Nothing but the sound of heavy breathing.
MARGOT (CONT'D)
What’cha got down there?
Percy wheels around, thrusting out a can of MACE he was shaking, blasts her in the eyes while screaming.
MARGOT (CONT'D)
AHHHHH! FUCK!
30.
Margot opens the door, falls out of the van, staggers around blindly. Percy jumps out, runs around back -- and into Margot. He screams, MACES HER AGAIN.
MARGOT (CONT'D)
AHHHH!!!! STOP!!!!
She GASPS for air.
MARGOT (CONT'D)
Whyyyyyy?
PERCY
You tried abducting me! You put me in a van and took my phone!
MARGOT
If I were kidnapping you, you think I’d give you all my personal information first?
Percy considers this for a beat.
PERCY
I guess that’s true.
MARGOT
Couldn’t you just use your rape whistle?
PERCY
Why would I have a rape whistle?
MARGOT
WHY DO YOU HAVE MACE??
(then, polite)
Sorry. Can you please get the hose?
Percy looks around, spots a hose, grabs it and runs it back and aims it at her. He presses the nozzle...  nothing.
PERCY
It’s broken!
MARGOT
Did you turn the water on?
PERCY
You have to turn the water on?
MARGOT
Are you fucking with me? Turn the spigot.
Percy runs back to the house with the hose and examines a fuel gauge.
31.
MARGOT (CONT'D)
That’s the gas meter. Over there.
He sees it, turns the spigot, comes back to Margot.
He BLASTS her in the face with the highly pressured water.
She puts her hands up to stop it.
MARGOT (CONT'D)
Fuck! Ow! Gimme that!
She twists the nozzle, lowers the pressure and sprays herself.
She finally exhales.
PERCY
I don’t know how to work the
equipment. We have gardeners.
MARGOT
Percy...  I wasn’t trying to abduct you. I just thought you were cute.
PERCY
You think I’m cute?
MARGOT
Yeah, back when I had retinas.
PERCY
(thinks, then)
Maybe we should go on a date then?
Or we don’t have to.
MARGOT
No, I want to. Just gimme like half an hour to flush out my contacts.
PERCY
I didn’t mean now. I meant tomorrow.
MARGOT
Fine. Yes. Great.
Percy retrieves his bike from the back of the van.
PERCY
See you tomorrow then?
MARGOT
(thumbs up, winces)
Can’t wait.
He smiles the smallest of smiles then bikes away leaving Margot on her lawn, wet, red and exhausted.
32.
EXT. LOBSTER CLAW - PARKING LOT - NIGHT
Margot and Sara sit on the curb while Henry opens all the doors and windows of the van. Margot holds a wet rag to her eyes.
MARGOT
I can’t believe this kid is going
to Princeton. He’s dumb as shit.
HENRY
He’s not dumb, he’s just scared of the world. They’re all like this. They grow up encased in bubblewrap.
SARA
My cousin, she’s nineteen and still lives at home. Doesn’t drive, doesn’t go to parties. Always on her phone.
MARGOT
Well, I need the van again
tomorrow.
HENRY
It’s gonna take a week to air this thing out and Sara’s pregnant, she can’t be breathing these fumes. You’ve lost van privileges.
(points off screen)
Ask Fern for the claw car.
ANGLE ON
A DODGE NEON wrapped in vinyl “Lobster Claw” marketing.
MARGOT
Yeah, that’ll drop his panties.
They stop talking as a pretty local girl, MELANIE, walks by, gets into a late model Porsche.
MELANIE
Hey guys!
They wave back, ad lib hellos. After she passes... 
HENRY
(conspiratorial)
Y’know, you could do what Melanie’s doing and get a sugar daddy. You won’t need to worry about a car. Or property taxes.
33.
MARGOT
The whole point of this Buick thing is that it’s quick.
(off Melanie)
I’m not gonna be on call to some rich asshole all summer. So if you see me doing that, it means I’ve compromised who I am and you can kill me. Because I’ve given up.
(beat)
But ya know, good for Melanie.
SARA
Honestly, sounds like he was just
nervous. A date could be good.
MARGOT
(in her head)
I need to be making money. I need
that car.
SARA
Listen. Go on a date. Get drunk together. He’ll loosen up. It’ll be fun!
Margot looks at Sara, an idea forming... 
MARGOT
Of course. We’ll just get drunk
together. Why didn’t I think of
that?
EXT. TOWNIE BAR - NIGHT
Pool table, juke box, neon beer signs. Margot finishes a beer. Percy looks out of the place amongst the older crowd.
MARGOT
I’m so glad we’re doing this. A date was a great idea.
PERCY
Can I ask you a question?
MARGOT
Shoot.
PERCY
Am I allowed to be here?
34.
MARGOT
Oh, yeah. I know the owner. It’s fine.
(looks around)
Where’s the waitress?
PERCY
He said it’s okay?
MARGOT
Yeah. He put it in writing. I got
it notarized and everything.
(then, softens)
Look, you’re going to college soon, you should get used to being in a bar.
PERCY
(considers)
Okay.
(then)
I just hope my parents don’t see
that I’m here.
MARGOT
(looking around)
Do they come here?
PERCY
No, they track my phone.
MARGOT
(beat)
Wow. Okay.
(looks around)
I need a drink.
PERCY
Why?
MARGOT
I’ve been tense.
PERCY
(concerned)
Is everything okay?
MARGOT
Yeah, it’s just -- I barely know
you, but I’ll just tell you.
She moves closer, presses her breasts against his arm.
35.
MARGOT (CONT'D)
And I had a dream about you. It was really intense. Don’t ask.
Percy pulls out his phone, nervously scrolls.
PERCY
Okay.
MARGOT
You ever have one of those?
Percy thinks, puts his phone down.
PERCY
Actually, yeah.
She moves even closer.
MARGOT
Tell me.
PERCY
You know Harley Quinn? From Suicide
Squad?
MARGOT
(no idea)
...  Sure.
PERCY
I had a dream I wouldn't let her adopt a dog, so she locked me in one of the dog cages and dragged me back to her hideout. Very intense.
MARGOT
(confused)
...  And then you banged?
PERCY
What? No! I kicked at the cage and screamed until finally Inez came in my room and woke me up.
MARGOT
(beat)
How the fuck is that a sex dream?
PERCY
You asked if I have intense dreams.
36.
MARGOT
You’re right. I should’ve been more specific.
A WAITRESS comes over.
MARGOT (CONT'D)
Alright, here we go. Makers neat.
And my friend here will have a... 
PERCY
Pepsi.
Margot’s face falls.
WAITRESS
We only have Coke.
