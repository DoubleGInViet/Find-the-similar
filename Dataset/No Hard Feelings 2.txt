PERCY
Hmm.
MARGOT
No, Percy, no. He’ll have a beer.
PERCY
(searches menu)
In that case I’ll have...  an O’Doul’s beer, please. Thank you.
MARGOT
(annoyed)
You sure?
PERCY
Oh wait, you guys sell daiquiris?
Margot brightens.
MARGOT
Only the best in Montauk!
PERCY
I’ve always wanted to try one.
(then, dramatic)
One virgin daiquiri, please.
The Waitress leaves. Margot quietly fumes.
PERCY (CONT'D)
Oh they have Big Buck Hunter. Cool.
Do you have any quarters?
MARGOT
You don’t want an adult beverage?
37.
PERCY
Oh no, I don’t drink.
MARGOT
Never?
PERCY
Never.
MARGOT
You’re eighteen. You’re not even
curious about drinking?
Percy pulls his phone out, scrolls.
PERCY
I won’t like it.
MARGOT
But what if you do.
PERCY
I won’t.
MARGOT
(referencing Percy)
Well if you’ve never done anything different, how do you know you won’t like something else better?
The Waitress returns with drinks.
WAITRESS
Manhattan for the lady and a virgin daiquiri for the young man.
MARGOT
(to waitress)
Stay close.
The Waitress leaves. Margot puts her drink down, studies Percy for a beat.
MARGOT (CONT'D)
Drinking’s a social lubricant.
You’d benefit. You wouldn’t need to
pull out your phone every time you
got nervous.
PERCY
I’m not nervous.
Margot takes Percy’s straw, puts it in her bourbon and pushes the straw towards his mouth. He purses his lips, resists.
38.
MARGOT
It’s time to learn. You’re going to college in the fall. C’mon. Open hatch. Baby bird. Eat your vitamins.
She pokes at his mouth with it.
MARGOT (CONT'D)
Let me in. Boop. Beep. Bop.
VOICE (O.S.)
Margot Chapman as I live and breathe.
REVEAL a townie in an Islanders shirt. Margot forces a smile.
MARGOT
Hi, Travis.
Travis is drunk. Which makes it hard to pretend he’s not heartbroken and angry.
TRAVIS
I thought you died or something
cause I suddenly stopped hearing
from you.
Percy watches with relief, thankful for the distraction.
MARGOT
Nope. Still alive, still thriving.
TRAVIS
I don’t know if you heard... 
He holds up his hand, showing off a wedding band.
MARGOT
(genuine)
Hey, that’s great! Congratulations.
I’m really happy for you.
PERCY
Congratulations.
Travis looks at Percy, trying to get a beat on him.
TRAVIS
Anyway, your little disappearing
act was the best thing that ever
happened to me.
MARGOT
Well it sounds like you’re doing
great. It was great catching up.
39.
TRAVIS
Big time. She’s fucking amazing. She speaks three languages and she’s hot as fuck. She’s so fucking hot it’s like I don’t even know why she’s with me. The sex is incredible, too. Hottest girl I’ve ever been with.
MARGOT
That’s great. Is she easy to clean?
Is her vagina dishwasher safe?
TRAVIS
No, she’s a real person. Unlike you.
MARGOT
What part of Russia did they mail her from?
TRAVIS
Best of all, when I told her I loved her, she said it back instead of running away like a coward.
MARGOT
That must have been an exciting second date.
TRAVIS
(to Percy)
Careful with this one. She’s slippery.
Travis staggers away. Margot gulps her drink.
PERCY
Can I ask you a question?
MARGOT
What?
PERCY
Is that your ex boyfriend?
MARGOT
(laughs)
Travis? Uh, no. More of a friend.
PERCY
Really? Cause it seems you don’t like him.
MARGOT
You met him. Did you like him?
PERCY
I didn’t have sex with him.
40.
Beat.
MARGOT
Want to? I can call him back over.
PERCY
I just don’t understand why you’d have sex with someone you don’t like.
MARGOT
(thrown)
Because I was drunk. Or lonely. Or sad. And it was Christmas. Okay? I don’t know, who gives a fuck? Let’s just have fun.
Margot downs the rest of her drink.
PERCY
Do you need alcohol to have fun?
Beat. Margot glares at Percy.
MARGOT
Some nights I don’t drink at all. I just get super high.
PERCY
Hmm. Can I ask you a question?
Margot loses it.
MARGOT
You don’t have to ask me if you can ask me a question every time, dude. Just ask the fucking question.
PERCY
I’m just trying to get to know you.
Margot looks out the window, clocks the empty beach.
WAITRESS
Another virgin daquieri?
PERCY
Yes, please.
MARGOT
No. We’re leaving. Pay the bill and meet me outside.
PERCY
Where are we going?
41.
EXT. BEACH - ENTRANCE - MOMENTS LATER
They walk on to the beach.
MARGOT
I had a lot to drink in there, I
think I’m drunk.
Percy looks around.
PERCY
I think it’s closed.
(off sign)
Yup. After 8. Closed.
MARGOT
Good. We’ll have it to ourselves.
PERCY
We could get in trouble. And it’s
not even sunny.
MARGOT
This is better. Nobody can see us.
PERCY
(worried)
Yeah, there’s no lifeguards.
MARGOT
Good. We can skinny dip.
Margot hooks her fingers in his belt loops, draws Percy closer.
MARGOT (CONT'D)
Let’s get you out of these jean shorts.
PERCY
What about riptides?
MARGOT
You’re right, here comes one now.
Margot gives his shorts a tug.
PERCY
Careful! You’re gonna rip them.
He pulls them up.
MARGOT
(flirty)
Yeah, I am.
42.
PERCY
They were a gift.
MARGOT
From who, Richard Simmons?
PERCY
No, my mom.
MARGOT
(tugs)
C’mon. I wanna see your pussy.
PERCY
(conflicted)
I don’t know... 
Margot gives up, lets go. Tries another tactic.
MARGOT
Guess you’re just not attracted to me. Or maybe you think I’m ugly... 
PERCY
What? No.
MARGOT
Seems like it.
PERCY
I	don’t!
(quiet)
I think you’re really pretty.
MARGOT
Yeah?
Sensing an opening, she moves closer to him.
MARGOT (CONT'D)
Pretty where?
(takes off her shirt)
Pretty here?
(slips off shorts)
Or pretty here?
She stands before him naked for a beat, then runs into the water. [note: lit and shot respectfully, of course]
MARGOT (CONT'D)
(calls out from sea)
Nothing bad will happen. I promise.
Percy deliberates. Margot in the water does look inviting.
43.
PERCY
What about sharks?
MARGOT
None here!
PERCY
Jellyfish?
MARGOT
Out of season!
PERCY
Flesh eating bacter--
MARGOT
GET THE FUCK IN HERE RIGHT NOW!
PERCY
Okay, I’m going to trust you.
He quickly undresses (leaving on his glasses) and doggy paddles out to her.
MARGOT
See? That’s not so bad, right?
She puts her arms around him.
PERCY
I just hope there’s no riptides.
Margot moves in to kiss him when --
VOICE	(O.S.)
FUCK HER! FUCK HER IN THE BUTT!
ON THE BEACH
THREE PREPPY TEENS (two boys and a girl) watching and whooping and drinking beers.
IN THE WATER
PERCY
What’re they doing?
MARGOT
I don’t know.
(waves)
Hello!
The leader waves back, a stupid grin on his face.
44.
LEADER
Whatcha up to over there?
MARGOT
(shouting back)
Just doing our taxes.
LEADER
(points to their clothes)
These yours?
MARGOT
Yeah, no need to fold ‘em.
Loud giggling as the Teens pick up their clothes.
PERCY
They’re taking our clothes!
MARGOT
Put it down!
SIDEKICK
Eat this dick!
The LEADER puts Percy’s jean shorts on his head like a jester, does a jester dance.
MARGOT
I’m warning you!
GIRL
Bye, sea bitch!
The three leave with their clothes, their laughter fading away as they disappear down the shore. Percy freaks. Any chance of sex is now gone.
PERCY
You said nothing would happen! We
need to find an adult.
MARGOT
Percy, you are an adult.
As he considers this, Margot begins to swim away.
PERCY
Where are you going?!
She POWER STROKES parallel to the shore. She’s a great swimmer.
FARTHER DOWN THE BEACH
45.
The Teens walk along, going through their haul. The Leader pulls a condom from Margot’s shorts.
LEADER
Jackpot.
They don’t notice an enraged Margot emerging from the water, buck naked. She scoops up a fistful of sand.
MARGOT
C’mere, cunts.
They turn, surprised to find a soaking wet angry naked woman quickly approaching. Margot is fearsome.
SIDEKICK
Oh shit-
Margot HURLS the SAND in his face.
SIDEKICK (CONT'D)
OW!
He grabs his eyes, drops the clothes.
GIRL
Whoa, whoa, relax-
MARGOT
(to the girl)
What about you? You want the business?
Margot KICKS the girl HARD in the crotch.
She groans in pain, drops to her knees. Two down. Only the Leader left. Margot retrieves her bikini top and brandishes it like a whip.
MARGOT (CONT'D)
You think it’s cool to steal clothes?
LEADER
(points to girl)
It was her idea! I don’t want the
business!
She reaches for his head. He flinches. She grabs the shorts.
MARGOT
These jean shorts were a gift!
LEADER
I didn’t know! I’m sorry.
46.
MARGOT
Now get outta here!
They just stand there, in shock. Margot raises the back of her hand.
MARGOT (CONT'D)
You want a fresh one?
They stagger away among murmurs of “crazy” and “sea bitch.”
MARGOT (CONT'D)
And stay outta Montauk!
IN THE WATER
Percy watches Margot approach with their belongings. She drops them on the sand before returning to the water. She paddles over to Percy.
MARGOT (CONT'D)
So where were we?
She puts her arms around his shoulders, tries to kiss him.
PERCY
What happened over there?
MARGOT
I got our clothes back.
She goes to kiss him again. He pushes her away.
PERCY
Did you beat up those kids?
MARGOT
No. They apologized.
PERCY
I heard screaming.
MARGOT
That was the apologizing.
PERCY
I don’t like this. Something’s
really wrong with you.
MARGOT
They had our clothes, keys, phones, wallets. I got them back. What would you have done, nothing? You should be thanking me!
47.
PERCY
(high-pitched)
I was coming up with a plan!
MARGOT
A plan to call your parents?
(mocking)
“Mommy, Daddy, teens stole my denim panties!”
(then, sweet)
I’m sorry, that was mean. Let’s
fuck.
PERCY
...  No?
Margot smacks the water in frustration.
MARGOT
WHY NOT!?
PERCY
Because you’re scary! It’s like you’re trying to eat me or kill me.
MARGOT
What a waste of time, man. I feel
sorry for you. I’m done.
She swims towards shore.
PERCY
I feel sorry for you. You drive a
freaking lobster car.
MARGOT
Hey, at least I’m not scared to drive.
She picks up the pile of clothes and heads to the car. Percy emerges from the water,
PARKING LOT
Margot gets to the claw car, throws Percy’s clothes on the passenger seat. She gets in and gets dressed. Percy, naked, runs up to her door, tries it -- it’s locked.
PERCY
(bangs on window)
Gimme my clothes!
Margot tosses his clothes out to him. He picks up his shorts, feels the pockets.
48.
PERCY (CONT'D)
Where’s my phone?
(then)
Is it in your car?
MARGOT
(quick look)
Nope.
PERCY
You barely even looked!
MARGOT
It’s not in here, Percy.
PERCY
Just check! My parents need to be
able to know where I am.
MARGOT
(blows up)
Why? What if they don’t?!
Margot doesn’t wait for an answer, throws the car in reverse. Percy instinctively jumps on the hood, still naked. A determination we haven’t seen before.
PERCY
Gimme my phone!
MARGOT
Percy, get off the hood.
PERCY
Not until I get my phone.
MARGOT
Guess we’re doing this.
She throws the car into gear and slowly drives across the parking lot with Percy on the hood. She exits on to a --
SERVICE ROAD
They pass several people who look on in amazement.
MARGOT (CONT'D)
I will drive to fucking Chicago.
Don’t fucking test me.
She picks up speed, 15...  20... 25. A curve up ahead, then:
HEADLIGHTS
49.
An 18 WHEELER blows by, inches from the car. Percy SCREAMS.
MARGOT (CONT'D)
Oh shit.
PERCY
Let me off! Let me off!
MARGOT
(shaken)
Yup! I’m pulling over
More HEADLIGHTS approach. They belong to
A POLICE CAR
Going the other way. The COPS clock the bizarre scene of a naked teenager on a lobster car hood.
FLASHING LIGHTS
MARGOT (CONT'D)
Fuck!
The POLICE CAR hits the brakes, begins executing a three-point-turn on the narrow country road.
Margot slams the steering wheel in frustration. It’s over.
MARGOT (CONT'D)
Idiot!
She starts to slow down a flashing red light and ringing bell announce a train approaching up ahead.
Margot checks her rearview mirror to find the COP CAR struggling with the turn. Then back at the crossing gates.
The COP CAR finally rights itself, speeds towards Margot.
MARGOT (CONT'D)
(thinks, then)
I’m on probation, I can’t lose my
license!
MARGOT FLOORS IT.
Percy SCREAMS as the lobster car RACES towards the descending gates. Percy looks back, sees the gates dropping.
PERCY
What the fuck are you doing!?
50.
The CLAW CAR accelerates across the tracks just under the closing gates. Margot brakes. Percy still clings to the hood, eyes shut tight. He slowly opens them, looks around.
Percy then looks at Margot, almost in awe.
PERCY (CONT'D)
Holy fucking shit.
INT. MARGOT'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Percy, still high from their close call, excitedly peaks through the blinds facing the street.
PERCY
I don’t see any cops out there. I think we lost them!
Margot pulls a candle from a drawer, lights it.
MARGOT
Are you sure?	Keep looking.
PERCY
I can’t believe we drove across the train tracks. I thought we were gonna die!
MARGOT
You were really brave, holding onto the hood like that. Most guys would have fallen off. But not you.
(downs her drink)
We need music.
PERCY
Yeah!
(then)
What? Why?
Margot exits the room. Percy sits down on the couch, takes a look around the space.
PERCY (CONT'D)
(calls out)
I like your house! Cozy.
MARGOT (O.S.)
Thanks! The bedroom’s the best
part. I’ll show it to you later.
Suddenly music starts BLASTING.
51.
Margot re-enters holding a bluetooth speaker. She sets the speaker down, starts grooving to the music.
MARGOT (CONT'D)
DANCE PARTY!
Margot grooves around him. She’s weird and uninhibited. He bobs his head, trying to look supportive.
MARGOT (CONT'D)
Dance with me!
Percy shakes his head no, still bobbing supportively. Margot pulls Percy to his feet.
PERCY
Okay, okay, you got me. I’m dancing.
Percy bobs his head. Margot sways closer and closer to him, syncing up with his bobbing. She pulls him in and they bob as one for a couple beats. He sits back down. She turns off the music.
MARGOT
WHEWW!
(then)
You wanna see the bedroom?
PERCY
Maybe in a little bit.
Percy nervously scratches his neck. Margot takes Percy’s glasses off.
MARGOT
We can go slow.
PERCY
Mm hmm. The slower the sexier.
He itches his cheek. He scratches his armpit. He scratches his back.
MARGOT
You okay?
PERCY
Yeah, I’m a little itchy.
She studies his neck.
PERCY (CONT'D)
Does it look weird?
52.
MARGOT
It’s fine.
PERCY
My back itches, too.
She lifts up his shirt, exposing his back, covered in hives.
MARGOT
Jesus.
He stands, checks himself out in the mirror.
PERCY
(mortified)
Oh God.
MARGOT
People normally get rashes after
they have sex.
PERCY
This happens sometimes when I get
nervous. I’m sorry.
There will be no sex tonight. They sit quietly as Percy scratches himself. She looks at him for a beat, stands up.
MARGOT
I’ll be right back.
She exits.
LIVING ROOM - LATER
They’re on the couch. Margot is applying anti-itch cream to Percy’s back.
MARGOT (CONT'D)
This is for surf board rash, but it should do the trick.
PERCY
I’m so embarrassed.
MARGOT
Don’t be. I went as a baby to a Halloween party. My crush was there. And as we were hooking up we both realized that I had gotten a diaper rash from my costume. I was 26.
53.
PERCY
You didn’t wear underwear?
MARGOT
Diapers are underwear.
PERCY
No, they’re not. Diapers are like
wearable toilets.
MARGOT
Well I didn’t use it.
They laugh.
MARGOT (CONT'D)
There’s a smile. You should smile
more. You have a great smile.
PERCY
I don’t have a lot to smile about. I’m really fucked up.
MARGOT
Oh you’re the one? I read about you.
(then)
Come on, Percy. Everyone’s fucked up.
PERCY
I hate leaving my room.
MARGOT
I’ve lived in this house my whole life.
PERCY
You’ve lived in one house in one town? You’re like a character in a children’s book.
MARGOT
(smiles)
I love it here. People look after
each other. There’s a community.
PERCY
Yeah, I guess that makes sense.
MARGOT
I did leave once. Packed my life
into my car and drove across the
country to surf every beach in
California.
54.
PERCY
You drove across the country alone?!
MARGOT
Yeah. I wanted to do something
totally new.
PERCY
Weren’t you scared of getting murdered?
MARGOT
I was eighteen, I didn’t really
think about it.
PERCY
That’s all I think about.
MARGOT
I made this special surfboard. It had a map of every California beach I was going to surf.
PERCY
(impressed)
You surfed every beach in California?
MARGOT
Oh, no. I only made it as far as
Colorado and turned back.
PERCY
After all that you turned back?! Why?
MARGOT
My mom got sick. I had to take care of her.
PERCY
Why couldn’t your dad do it?
MARGOT
Because he was in the city with his family.
PERCY
(realizing)
Ohhh. So your mom--
MARGOT
Was his receptionist... 
(then)
It was a mess. He disappeared. Had his lawyers clean it up. They gave my mom this house for us to go away.
(MORE)
55.
MARGOT (CONT'D)
(then)
Lift up your arms.
She applies cream under his arms.
PERCY
Well I’m adopted.
MARGOT
Oh yeah? How’s that been?
PERCY
How much time do you have?
She smiles.
PERCY (CONT'D)
It’s complicated. Probably why I
spend so much time alone. Having
Jean in my life helps.
MARGOT
Who?
PERCY
My old nanny. Jean basically raised me. You guys kinda remind me of each other. You guys should meet!
MARGOT
Yeah, maybe.
(then)
Turn around.
Percy turns and faces Margot. She applies cream to his chest.
PERCY
Sorry I couldn’t have sex with you today. I know I’m being a tease.
MARGOT
...  That’s okay.
PERCY
Maybe we can spend the day together tomorrow? Then I promise I’ll put out.
Margot hides a laugh.
MARGOT
Okay.
56.
EXT. STREET - DAY
Percy and Margot bike/rollerblade with rescue dogs pulling them on leashes.
EXT. PARK - DAY
Margot and Percy play keep-away from the dogs with a tennis ball, throw it back and forth as the pack chases them.
INT. BEST FRIENDS - DAY
Margot and Percy shampoo dogs. Crispin watches them laughing together.
INT. ARCADE - LATER
-	They play skee-ball. Percy hits the center ring. Tickets fly out.
-	They sit inside a TWO-PLAYER Halo-type fighting game.
CLOSE ON
Percy’s avatar decapitates Margot’s avatar.
PERCY
Sorry.
POP-A-SHOT
Percy shoots. Margot blocks him.
MARGOT
Now we’re even.
INT. ARCADE - DAY
They play Dance Dance Revolution together, dancing in sync.
TICKET COUNTER -	LATER
They dump their tickets on the counter and scan their prize choices.
EXT. ARCADE - LATER
They sit on a bench. Margot wears a novelty beer helmet with two sodas in it, a STUFFED PANDA at her feet.
57.
Percy reaches into his bag of prizes, pulls out a Nerf football, continues digging.
PERCY
Alright, I have a prize for both of us. Close your eyes.
(she does)
And stick out your finger.
(she does)
Now you’re stuck with me forever.
Margot opens her eyes. Looks down to see her finger in a --
PERCY (CONT'D)
Chinese finger trap!
MARGOT
Ha.
She yanks her finger, pulling Percy’s hand with it.
PERCY
Wait.
Margot pulls again.
PERCY (CONT'D)
Stop pulling away.
MARGOT
You’re pushing.
PERCY
Yeah, you need me to get out, you
can’t do it alone. Push in.
She pushes in. Their fingers easily slide out.
PERCY (CONT'D)
See?
MARGOT
Yeah, but you can’t just Chinese
finger trap someone. It’s fucked
up.
They sit there for a beat, quiet.
PERCY
I bet if we went to high school
together we’d be friends?
MARGOT
Uh, yeah. Don’t you?
58.
PERCY
I didn’t have a lot friends. I didn’t go to dances or anything.
(then)
I bet you were Prom Queen or something.
MARGOT
I didn’t even go to prom.
PERCY
Nobody asked you?!
MARGOT
Everyone asked me. And I had a date and a dress and everything. Just didn’t work out.
PERCY
Why?
(pause)
Sorry. It’s none of my business.
Beat.
MARGOT
I wrote my biological father. I had this fantasy he would read it and then drive over and apologize to my mom and me for leaving us. And then the morning of prom I got the letter returned to me. It was unopened. After that, I couldn’t go to Prom. I couldn’t do anything for a while. I told my date I was sick and just stayed home and cried.
PERCY
Sounds like we’d be friends.
She laughs.
PERCY (CONT'D)
Would you ever reach out to your dad?
MARGOT
Pfft. Fuck no. He left, he can reach out.
Percy has a strange look on his face.
MARGOT (CONT'D)
What?
Percy kisses Margot.
59.
It’s a long kiss. And a weird kiss as his eyes stay wide open. But it’s sweet. They pull apart. Percy wipes his mouth with the back of his hand.
PERCY
Sorry if that was too wet.
MARGOT
No, don’t apologize. That was
perfect wetness. You’re a great
kisser. So do you want to-
BUZZZZZ.
PERCY
(checking phone)
Oh Jean’s here!
MARGOT
Who?
PERCY
My nanny, remember?
(Raeding)
“Meet at the ice cream stand.”
MARGOT
I don’t have much time before I have to bartend. I thought we could go back to my place.
PERCY
We have all summer. Come on!
He takes her by the hand.
EXT. ICE CREAM STAND - DAY
Margot and Percy approach the stand. Percy lights up.
PERCY
Jean! Jean!
An ELDERLY WOMAN turns towards them.
MARGOT
It’s so nice to--
She walks right past Margot revealing a MAN in his 30s, athletic, older brother vibes. He points at Percy.
JEAN
What’s happening, Big Time?
60.
Percy and Jean execute an elaborate handshake. He turns to Margot, smiles warmly.
JEAN (CONT'D)
So this is the famous Margot.
I’ve heard a lot about you.
PERCY
(blushes)
Aw, Jean! C’mon, man.
MARGOT
(confused)
And you’re...  Jean? Percy’s nanny?
JEAN
(good-natured)
Mr. Mary Poppins.
Percy laughs. Margot laughs nervously.
JEAN (CONT'D)
Who wants ice cream?
LATER
Margot and Jean stroll down the pier eating ice cream.
JEAN (CONT'D)
It was just a couple summers during college when Percy was in middle school. Our parents are friends. But we stayed close. We’ve become friends and I care about him a lot.
Pull back to REVEAL Percy is holding Margot’s hand as the three of them walk. Margot looks extremely uncomfortable.
PERCY
(licks ice cream cone)
Jean’s like my older brother.
MARGOT
That’s great. How old are you?
JEAN
Twenty-seven. You?
MARGOT
Yeah.
(quickly, to Percy)
Show Jean what we won at the arcade.
Percy digs into the prize bag, pulls out the Nerf football.
61.
PERCY
Check it out, Jean.	Margot won it.
Jean
Nice, Margot!
(then)
Remember, Percy? Flagpole pattern, go long!
Percy darts away to receive the pass. Jean chucks the football way past Percy. It rolls off the boardwalk and down onto the sandy beach.
PERCY
I’ll get it!
Percy races off.
MARGOT
He’s so fast. Little motor on that guy.
Jean turns back to Margot, no longer smiling.
JEAN
What do you want?
MARGOT
Excuse me?
JEAN
It’s his parents’ money, not his.
MARGOT
No!
JEAN
You like little kids or something?
MARGOT
Do I like little kids?	You’re a
fucking male nanny, bro.
JEAN
It was a summer job. And men can be nannies.
MARGOT
They can. But they shouldn’t. Cause it’s weird.
JEAN
This isn’t about me.
62.
MARGOT
Are you even allowed to be here?
There’s middle school a hundred
yards away.
JEAN
(not biting)
What do you want from him?
MARGOT
Same thing as you. I wanna date him.
JEAN
(darkens)
Did Percy tell you I work for the
government now?
MARGOT
Lemme guess: child services?
JEAN
I don’t know what you’re doing with him. But if you hurt him, I will hurt you.
He stares her down as Percy returns with the football, out of breath.
PERCY
I had to wrestle a dog for it, but
I got it.
INT. MARGOT'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
Sara and Henry are sitting on the couch.
MARGOT (O.S.)
Okay, ready? I’m gonna bring it out.
Margot enters holding a NURSERY MOBILE with a dozen handmade surfboards.
SARA
Oh my god, Margot! You made this?
MARGOT
Yeah, figured it might help get
them into surfing early.
Henry examines one of the little surfboards.
63.
HENRY
(concerned)
This one has a shark bite.
SARA
Let’s try it out!
MARGOT
I think I have batteries somewhere.
KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
Margot searches through her drawers. Takes out some plastic bins, looks under some papers. A letter catches her eye. She picks it up. It’s the returned letter from her father.
KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK
Margot snaps to, sees a MAN -- 30, slicked-back hair, pleated slacks, dress shirt and tasseled loafer -- smiling and waving at her back door. She opens it.
MAN
Margot!
MARGOT
(at a loss)
I’m sorry. Have we-- uh--
MAN
It’s Doug Hines! We went to high
school together.
Margot stares, trying to place him.
DOUG
I ran varsity track? Drove that
cherry red Miata? Nothing?
(then, reluctant)
I had sex with Mrs. Walsh, the
Spanish teacher.
MARGOT
Doug Hines! Yeah, you were on tv.
Didn’t Mrs. Walsh go to jail?
DOUG
Mrs. Hines did. Then we got married.
He flashes a wedding ring.
64.
DOUG (CONT'D)
But, ya know, they never run that story. It’s a double standard, too. I’m sure you date older guys.
MARGOT
Actually, I only date teenagers.
DOUG
Hey, have you been hanging out with my wife?!
They share a laugh.
DOUG (CONT'D)
Anyway, so I’m a realtor now. I
don’t have to tell you this is a
fabulous neighborhood. A half acre
on this street? Name your price.
MARGOT
I have company, but it was good
catching up, Doug.
She starts to shut the door. He puts his foot to stop it.
DOUG
Hear me out.
MARGOT
Why?
DOUG
Because if you don’t pay off your lien, the county will fire sale it. You’ll might get half of what this place is worth. Let me list it so you can get full price.
Margot slams the door. We HEAR Doug through it.
DOUG (O.S.) (CONT'D) Hasta la vista, Margot! I’ll slide my card under.
She picks up the card up and tosses it and exits.
We HEAR the opening of Supertramp’s Breakfast in America. “Take a look at my girlfriend... ”
65.
INT. PERCY’S ROOM - DAY
The music continues as Percy puts a tuxedo on. He checks himself out in front of a mirror, adjusts his bow time.
INT. MARGOT’S BEDROOM - SAME
Margot pulls out an old PROM DRESS, still in its plastic.
INT. LIMO - NIGHT
Margot and Percy sit in the back of a stretch limousine.
PERCY
Was this a stupid idea?
MARGOT
(smiles, touched)
No, I love it. We’re finally going to prom.
PERCY
(nods)
I have something for you.
He pulls a corsage from his inside jacket pocket, puts it around her wrist. She’s touched.
She opens her purse, produces a white carnation and pins it on Percy’s lapel.
MARGOT
It’s from my garden.
They both sit there.
MARGOT (CONT'D)
You look very handsome.
PERCY
So do you.
Beat. She takes his hand.
EXT. BOSTWICK YACHT CLUB - HOSTESS STAND
Margot waits while Percy checks in with the hostess. She peeks inside, clocks the dimly lit bar area where a mix of moneyed older men and beautiful young women flirt. She eyes them curiously.
66.
INT. YACHT CLUB RESTAURANT - LATER
Margot and Percy are halfway through their dinner. Margot is laughing. They’re having a good time.
MARGOT
You’re scared of the Meg? A
dinosaur shark?
PERCY
They existed. And we can’t prove
they’re extinct.
VOICE (O.S.)
Percy?
He looks up to see NATALIE, 17, Asian, friendly and cute.
PERCY
Natalie, hey!
He gets up. They hug awkwardly. Margot clocks a possible rival.
NATALIE
I haven’t seen you in forever. My parents said you’re going to Princeton?
PERCY
Yup!
NATALIE
I’m applying too, for next year!
How funny would it be if we went
there together!
MARGOT
So funny.
PERCY
Oh, sorry, this is Margot. Margot, this is Natalie. Our parents are friends.
NATALIE
Nice to meet you. Are you friends
with them too?
Margot gives her best fake smile.
MARGOT
Nope!
Beat.
67.
PERCY
What about you? Excited for senior year?
NATALIE
Yeah, but I look at the freshman
girls and I feel like... 
Natalie tries thinking of the word, looks at Margot.
NATALIE (CONT'D)
Like a million years old now.
Margot swirls her drink. Natalie’s thrown by her presence.
NATALIE (CONT'D)
Well, it was good to see you. I
don’t know what you’re doing later
but I’m going to a party. There’ll
be Princeton people there.
MARGOT
(fake nice)
We have plans, but thanks so much.
NATALIE
Oh.
(to Percy)
I’ll send you the address just in case.
MARGOT
No need.
NATALIE
Can’t hurt.
MARGOT
(pointed)
Might hurt.
NATALIE
(on her phone)
And sent.
(then)
Nice meeting you, Miss Margot.
She walks away. Margot glares at her, turns back to Percy.
MARGOT
Jeez, I don’t recall ordering a phony bitch before our appetizers.
PERCY
Natalie? She’s like super nice.
68.
MARGOT
I think she farted. Do you smell that?
PERCY
(sniffs)
No.
They eat for a bit.
PERCY (CONT'D)
Did you know Princeton’s only three hours from here?
MARGOT
I did not.
PERCY
Yeah. It’s an easy trip. I could come back every weekend if I wanted to.
MARGOT
Why would you want to?
PERCY
...  To see you. Or you could visit me.
Percy studies Margot, sees how uncomfortable she is.
MARGOT
Maybe. I don’t really do long
distance... 
That’s not the reaction he was hoping for.
MARGOT (CONT'D)
Look, why don’t we just get through prom together first. Then we can worry about all of that stuff.
PERCY
(stung)
I guess.
Percy stares at his plate, forlorn.
MARGOT
You’ll probably get sick of me, anyway.
PERCY
I won’t.
69.
MARGOT
You don’t know that. Maybe you end up wanting to hang out with someone your own age.
PERCY
Like who?
MARGOT
(shrugs)
Fuck if I know. Natalie?
PERCY
You just said she was a phony bitch.
MARGOT
And you said she was super nice.
No one knows anything.
PERCY
(frustrated)
I don’t understand what you want.
MARGOT
I want you to relax and have fun tonight.
Percy puts down his fork, stands.
PERCY
I wanna go.
INT. LIMO - LATER
Percy and Margot sit across from each other.
MARGOT
You alright?
PERCY
(cold)
Yup.
MARGOT
I don’t want you to be mad at me.
PERCY
I’m not.
MARGOT
I just want to be realistic.
PERCY
Me too.
70.
The limousine stops. Margot looks out the window.
HER POV
A fancy Hamptons estate.
MARGOT
Where are we?
PERCY
I need to hang out with people my
own age. Like you said.
He exits the limo. Margot follows.
MARGOT
I didn’t mean tonight.
PERCY
Then don’t come.
MARGOT
(sighs)
It’s a bunch of college kids.
PERCY
There’ll be high school kids too.
MARGOT
Let’s just go back to my house.
PERCY
Do whatever you want. I need a drink.
Percy goes inside.
MARGOT
(to herself)
Drink?
Margo reluctantly goes in.
INT. HOUSE PARTY - CONTINUOUS
It’s mostly TEENAGERS recording each other on their phones. Other kids post videos of what they’ve just filmed. Some partygoers are commenting on posts of the party, while others comment on the comments. In the corner, a few hardcore kids talk to each other without filming it.
Margot enters. Glances skitter between the Partygoers -- get a load of her. They go back to their phones. She walks off.
71.
AT THE BAR
Margot spots Percy pouring himself a stiff drink. She heads over. She picks up the bottle he just poured, examines it.
MARGOT
This is vermouth.
PERCY
(annoyed, doubling down)
I know! This is my drink.
He walks off. She sighs, spots a keg outside.
KEG AREA - MOMENTS LATER
Margot waits impatiently to fill up her red Solo cup as TWO WHITE BOY “INFLUENCERS” record a Tik Tok video at the keg.
TEEN #1
(into camera)
Yo, it’s your boy Cameron B, kicking off the summer right, at a sick party in Montauk celebrating another “Mental Health Awareness Day”.
TEEN #2
Okay, now me.
He hands him his phone.
TEEN #1
Ready.
IPHONE POV
TEEN #2
(into camera)
Yo, it’s me, Dash Gucci, and if you or someone you know is being bullied--
Margot enters frame and starts pumping the keg angrily.
TEEN #1
Can you not do that while we’re recording?
MARGOT
(pouring beer)
I’m just trying to get a beer. At a party.
TEEN #1
(to camera)
And that’s what a bully looks like.
72.
He films Margot.
MARGOT
(fake mortified)
No, not the phone! Somebody help!
I’m being filmed!
She rolls her eyes and leaves.
INT. HALLWAY - LATER
Margots wanders the party looking for Percy. She passes two beefy JOCKS in matching “Rye Country Day Wrestling” shirts. One taps her on the shoulder.
JOCK #1
Hey, how old are you?
Margot stops, turns.
MARGOT
That’s not a nice question to ask a woman.
JOCK #2
No disrespect. He loves cougars.
MARGOT
Excuse me?
JOCK #1
It’s all good. I fuck with big cats. And I heard wine tastes sweeter when there’s a little dust on the bottle.
JOCK #2
Bro! My dad said that, too. And he legit owns a vineyard.
MARGOT
Here’s a better idea. Why don’t you two climb in a wine barrel and blow each other.
Beat.	They exchange a shocked look.
JOCK #2
(way too loud)
Homophobes are not welcome at my party.
Margot looks around, gets self-conscious.
MARGOT
I’m not-- I’m not homophobic.
73.
A PUNK GIRL suddenly appears holding a phone and filming Margot. Margot jumps, surprised.
MARGOT (CONT'D)
Where the fuck did you come from?
PUNK GIRL
Is this the homophobe?
MARGOT
Stop filming me! No comment.
JOCK #1
That’s her.
(to Margot)
Say it again.
The Jocks also pull out their phones and film her.
JOCK #2
Say what you just said!
MARGOT
NO COMMENT!
Margot hurries away.
STAIRCASE - LATER
Margot walks up the staircase, trying to get around a group of ASIAN GIRLS sitting on the stairs looking at their phones.
MARGOT (CONT'D)
Have you guys seen Percy?
ASIAN GIRL #1
Wait are you his mom?
ASIAN GIRL #2
That’s Inez.
MARGOT
What the fuck? How old do you think
I am? Actually, don’t answer that.
ASIAN GIRL #1
He’s with Natalie, upstairs.
ASIAN GIRL #2
In the bedroom.
They all giggle. Margot’s eyes go wide. She steps over the girls and sprints up the stairs.
74.
ASIAN GIRLS
Hey!/Watch it!
UPSTAIRS - CONTINUOUS
Margot looks around frantically. It’s a long hallway with lots of doors. People everywhere blocking her way. She bulldozes down the hallway.
MARGOT
Move! Move! Move!
She FLINGS a FRAIL BOY aside. He cries out in pain.
MARGOT (CONT'D)
Coming through!
She pushes TWO GIRLS aside, opens a door, bursts in.
MARGOT (CONT'D)
Percy?!
A TEEN BOY alone on his phone. He looks up.
MARGOT (CONT'D)
Sorry! Continue.
Margot shuts the door and runs down the hallway, opens another door to find --
A BOY AND A GIRL, both on their phones. They look up. She shuts the door, opens another.
THREE TEENS IN BED... on their phones. They all look up.
MARGOT (CONT'D)
Does anybody fuck anymore?
She slams the door shut, tries another door, turns the handle. Locked. She KNOCKS LOUDLY.
MARGOT (CONT'D)
Percy?! Percy, open up!
She waits. Nothing. She jiggles the handle again
MARGOT (CONT'D)
Open the fucking door, Percy!
(waits, then)
If you don’t open this door right
now you’re in big trouble!
A crowd of Teens watch.
