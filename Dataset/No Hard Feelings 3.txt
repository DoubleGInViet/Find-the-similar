RANDOM TEEN
Does his nanny have the power to
ground him?
Desperate, she backs up and attempts to kick the door open, but her leg goes through the door and lodges halfway in it.
We HEAR a GIRL’S SCREAM from inside the room. A dozen phones begin filming.
MARGOT
Damn it!
Margot awkwardly reaches her hand through the hole she’s made and unlocks the door from the inside. The door opens with Margot still stuck in it.
HER POV
Percy and Natalie in bed, half naked.
MARGOT (CONT'D)
WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON IN HERE?
Margot struggles to pull her leg out, ripping her prom dress out of the splintered door. She finally does and stomps over to the bed.
MARGOT (CONT'D)
Did you fuck him!?
Natalie is terrified
NATALIE
No! I swear!
Margot, relieved, looks over at Percy, who is sitting up in bed and dry-heaving. Natalie runs out.
PERCY
The room is spinning.
MARGOT
Percy, did you take something?
(slaps him)
Answer me! Pills? Powder?
PERCY
I took a pill.
MARGOT
Shit.
She leads to the master bathroom.
76.
MARGOT (CONT'D)
Stick your finger down your throat and make yourself throw up.
PERCY
I’m scared.
MARGOT
Just do it, Percy!
He tries, but doesn’t go nearly far enough.
MARGOT (CONT'D)
Deeper, Percy.
PERCY
I can’t do it! Am I gonna die?
MARGOT
(with conviction)
Hold still. Open your mouth.
PERCY
What’re you--
She grabs the back of his head and jams her finger down his throat. After a brief struggle, he vomits into the toilet.
MARGOT
Do you feel better?
PERCY
Not really.
(then)
I didn’t know you can’t drink on Advil.
MARGOT
(stunned)
Seriously?
JOCK #1 (O.S.)
Found her!
Margot turns to see JOCK #1 with his PARENTS and several partygoers in tow.
DAD
That the homophobe?
JOCK #1
(pointing at Margot)
Yup!
77.
MARGOT
Your fucking parents are here?!
MOTHER
You think our son would have a
party without our consent?
DAD
(gets in Margot’s face)
Apologize to my bisexual son.
MARGOT
Fine, I don’t care. I’m sorry.
DAD
Now get out. You don’t belong here.
The Dad takes Margot by the arm. She pulls her arm away.
MARGOT
I don’t belong here?	You don’t
fucking belong here! YOU THINK
YOU’RE MONTAUK?
PERCY (O.S.)
(slurring, to Dad)
You apologize to her!
REVEAL Percy.
He has his suit on, but not shirt or shoes. He holds on the wall for support.
DAD
Both of you out. Now.
The Dad takes Margot by the arm again.
MARGOT
Step back. Step away from me.
PERCY
Leave her alone!
Margot yanks her arm away. Percy drunkenly lurches at Margot and the dad. Percy hauls back, takes a swing at Dad but Margot steps in and takes the punch to her throat instead--
PERCY (CONT'D)
Margot! Shit--
MARGOT
(clutching throat)
Ahhhhhhssssshittt... .!
78.
PERCY
Margot!
Every Partygoer pulls out their phone to record.
INT. LIMO - MOMENTS LATER
They sit across from each other. She has a cold beer pressed up against her throat. Percy sniffles.
MARGOT
(voice raspy)
Stop crying. I’m fine.
She cracks open the beer, takes a gulp.
MARGOT (CONT'D)
(clears her throat)
Just had to wet the whistle.
Percy gets up and sits beside her.
PERCY
I just want you to know I would
never hurt you.
MARGOT
I know.
He kisses her. It quickly escalates.
PERCY
I’m ready for you.
MARGOT
Are you sure?
PERCY
Yes.
Clothes start coming off.
MARGOT
I have a condom in my purse.
She looks around for her purse.
MARGOT (CONT'D)
Shit. I left it at the restaurant.
PERCY
It’s okay. I bought a value pack.
79.
He pulls out a box of 24 condoms from his jacket pocket. She slips out of her dress as he opens the value pack and struggles to tear open a condom.
PERCY (CONT'D)
I can’t find where to tear it.
MARGOT
Let me help.
She gently takes it and opens it as he watches her, drunk and swooning. She removes the condom.
PERCY
I love you.
She slides the condom back in the wrapper.
MARGOT
Percy... 
PERCY
You don’t have to say it back.	I
just want you to know.
MARGOT
You’re drunk.
PERCY
So?
MARGOT
I don’t think we should do this
when you’re drunk. Not for your
first time.
PERCY
But I’m ready.
MARGOT
I think we should we wait.
PERCY
If that’s what you want.
He gazes adoringly at her.
MARGOT
That’s what I want.
He cuddles up to her, happy.	She’s freaking out.
80.
EXT. BOSTWICK YACHT CLUB - DAY
Margot rollerblades up to the hostess stand. An OLDER HOST looks her over.
MARGOT
Hi, I left my purse here last
night.
HOST
Yes, you were dining with the younger gentleman. I think I saw it in the back. One moment.
Margot looks over at the bar to see Melanie (of the sugar baby BMW) with a HANDSOME OLDER MAN. Margot just stares, her face a mix of emotions.
HOST	(O.S.) (CONT'D)
Here’s your purse. Ma’am?
MARGOT
(snaps out of it)
Oh. Thank you.
She looks back. Melanie catches her gaze. Margot quickly looks away and rollerblades off.
INT. ALLISON AND LAIRD’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY
Percy shuffles in, hungover but happy. Allison and Laird exchange a look. He sits down, butters some toast.
LAIRD
Well look what the cat dragged in,
Allison?
Allison smugly whisks her matcha.
ALLISON
Fun night?
PERCY
Actually yeah. Really fun.
(checks his watch)
Shoot. I’m gonna be late for work.
ALLISON
You had a big night. Maybe went to a party?
PERCY
I did.
81.
LAIRD
I’ll drive you.
PERCY
Actually, can I drive? I was thinking about getting my license. I could use the practice.
LAIRD
My son, the driver. That’s great.
PERCY
Yeah. If I have a car, it’ll be
easier to see my girlfriend more.
ALLISON
Your girlfriend?
PERCY
Margot, yeah. She’s older, but she’s really fun. And she doesn’t want to do long distance so I’m not going to Princeton either.
Beat. Allison and Laird exchange a look.
LAIRD
What.
PERCY
I don’t know, Margot’s here, my
work is here, Montauk has
everything I need. It’s paradise.
LAIRD
Percy, you’re going to Princeton.
PERCY
I’m not.
ALLISON
What would you do?
PERCY
Work. Get a job.
LAIRD
Absolutely not.
PERCY
Here’s a solution: I go to
Princeton...  online. From here.
Everybody wins. Good, right?
82.
Laird presses his temples in an accupressure/meditation way.
ALLISON
(to Percy)
Why don’t you wait in the car. Your father will be out in a second.
Percy exits. A beat, then.
LAIRD
What the fuck was that?
ALLISON
What do you think it was? He’s
obviously in love with her!
INT. GARAGE - TESLA - SAME
Percy sits in the driver’s seat of his parent’s Tesla Model X. He tries out the controls, pretends to put an arm around an imaginary Margot.
PERCY
(to imaginary Margot)
You relax. I’ll drive. Also, I’m
getting into surfing.
Percy makes engine sounds as he pretends to steer.
INT. KITCHEN - SAME
Allison paces. Laird also paces. They’re both pacing in circles, but different circles.
LAIRD
She put this idea in his head. You know why? She’s angling for the Tesla. Call her right now. I’m gonna yell at her.
ALLISON
You’re gonna yell at the only person Percy will listen to? We need her on our side. He’s not going to listen to us. He needs to hear it from her.
INT. MARGOT’S HOUSE	- DAY
Margot lies on her bed, staring at the ceiling. Her phone buzzes. It’s Allison. Margot snaps out of her daze, answers.
83.
MARGOT
I was about to call you. Listen, Percy has gotten too attached and I can’t do this any--
INTERCUT W/ALLISON AND LAIRD
LAIRD
Forget about that deal. The car is yours.
Margot sits up, surprised.
MARGOT
Really?
LAIRD
You’ve gotten him out of his shell, he’s going to parties. He’s confident. It’s all we wanted.
MARGOT
That’s great!
LAIRD
You just have to convince him to go to Princeton.
A look of guilt washes over Margot.
MARGOT
Yeah. Okay.
ALLISON
I have the title and transfer in my office. We’ll sign it over to you today.
Margot exhales. Finally.
MARGOT
Thanks, guys.
GARAGE - TESLA - SAME
Percy checks out the controls of the Tesla. He turns it on.
INT. KITCHEN - SAME
Margot cuts out on the call.
ALLISON
Hello? Margot?
84.
GARAGE - TESLA - SAME
The car’s bluetooth syncs. Margot’s voice pipes in to the cabin.
MARGOT (O.S.)
(bluetooth)
And everything you said about Percy is true. He’s become a friend.
(waits, get nothing)
Hello?
Percy quickly turns off the car, in shock.
INT. KITCHEN - SAME
ALLISON
Hello? Margot?
INT. GARAGE - TESLA - SAME
Percy sits in the car, gutted. He gets out of the Tesla and goes back inside.
INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
Percy enters, sees Allison’s phone on the counter. Unable to resist, he quickly puts in her code and scrolls through the text messages. His face falls as he reads.
INT. BEST FRIENDS - DAY
Percy lies on the floor, despondent. Crispin grooms an Afghan Hound, a cigarette dangling from his lips.
PERCY
I just want to die.
CRISPIN
I got news for you, Percy. There’s only one good female in this world.
(to dog, baby talk)
And it’s you, Missy. Isn’t it?
Isn’t it?	Shu hsu hsu hsushu
The dog licks Crispin’s face. He loves it.
PERCY
She never liked me. She was just
using me.
85.
CRISPIN
Your problem is that you’re too nice.
PERCY
What do you mean “too nice?”
CRISPIN
Yeah! Chicks dig an asshole. She walked all over you. I mean she was eye-fucking me that day you guys were shampooing dogs.
(points to himself)
Asshole.
Percy’s phone buzzes. He checks it.
PERCY
It’s Margot. She wants to see me
tonight. I don’t know what to do.
CRISPIN
Well you’ve come to the right
person. As you know from our
conversations, I’ve been with a
plethora of women so I understand
the mindset.
(then)
Does she have the car yet?
PERCY
I don’t think so.
CRISPIN
It’s very simple. She broke your
heart. You break--
PERCY
Her heart?
CRISPIN
The car. That’s what she cares
about. I’m playing 3D chess, keep
up. Nothing crazy. Break the
antenna off. Crack a headlight.
Off Percy, an idea forming... 
INT. PERCY’S ROOM - NIGHT
Percy locks his door, pulls out a bottle of vermouth, pours it a coffee mug. He takes a swig, winces.
86.
INT. DINING ROOM - LATER
Percy and his parents are having dinner. It’s quiet. Percy fidgets at the table.
LAIRD
Everything okay, bud?
PERCY
Can I try some wine?
Allison exchanges a look with Laird.
ALLISON
I think that would be fine. You’re a young man now.
He fills his glass to the brim, gulps it down.
ALLISON (CONT'D)
Okay.
The doorbell RINGS.
LAIRD
Are we expecting someone?
ALLISON
I don’t think so.
FRONT DOOR
Laird opens the front door to find a surprised Margot. A moment of terror passes between them.
Percy pops into frame with giant glass of wine.
PERCY
(cheerful)
Did I double book?
INT. DINING ROOM - LATER
They eat in tense silence.
PERCY
Mom, Dad, aren’t you going to ask
Margot about herself?
LAIRD
Yeah, thanks Champ. So, Margot, where are you from originally?
87.
MARGOT
Here. From here.
LAIRD
(points to wall)
See this stone work? All local stones.
MARGOT
I thought I recognized them.
Laird and Allison fake laugh. Percy watches them like a hawk.
They go back to eating in silence.
MARGOT (CONT'D)
Mm. Great chicken. Moist.
ALLISON
Thank you. Conflict-free.
PERCY
Mom, you didn’t make it. Inez did.
LAIRD
Be nice, Percy.
PERCY
The food is conflict free, but the dinner isn’t. Mom, maybe we can throw the leftovers under the stairs for Inez?
LAIRD
Percy. Enough.
MARGOT
Well, the important thing is that
it’s delicious.
PERCY
I think the important thing is the truth.
Margot, Allison and Laird shift uncomfortably.
PERCY (CONT'D)
Speaking of which, I didn’t
actually get the dates wrong. I
wanted Margot here tonight. The
truth is I wanted to introduce
everyone, but I didn’t know how to
explain how old you are to my
parents.
Beat. They all laugh nervously, relieved.
88.
MARGOT
Well, I’m not that old. I know a
guy who married our high school
Spanish teacher. Forty year age
difference.
LAIRD
Well I hope he got an “A.”
They laugh. Percy laughs a weird, bitter, angry laugh.
PERCY
Mom, Dad, aren’t you going to ask
us how we met?
ALLISON
Uh, yeah. How’d you meet?
LAIRD
Was it an app?
PERCY
Margot, you want to tell them?
You know what, I’ll tell them. It’s actually really random. Margot came in to adopt a dog.
ALLISON
Awww.
PERCY
But I rejected her application because she was totally unqualified, but we still hit it off. In fact, I had to mace her to get her away from me and even that wouldn’t stop her! She was so horny haha.
LAIRD
Percy? Be a gentleman.
Percy’s phone BUZZES.
PERCY
It’s Crispin. I have to take this. You guys keep getting to know each other.
EXT. DRIVEWAY - MOMENTS LATER
Crispin straddling a ten-speed. He’s in a camo shirt and shorts. As Percy walks up, he raises a duffle bag.
89.
CRISPIN
I brought tools.
PERCY
We’re in the middle of dinner so we need to be fast.
CRISPIN
What’re you having?
PERCY
Fish tacos. And salad.
CRISPIN
I fucking love salad.
(then)
Okay, let’s put her in neutral and roll her out.
GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER
Percy and Garett roll the Buick out. Percy looks back at the house, nervously.
CRISPIN (CONT'D)
Let’s start with the side mirror.
INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Allison, Laird and Margot stare at each other nervously.
ALLISON
Did you tell him!?
MARGOT
No! Did you?
LAIRD
Of course not.
ALLISON
Well, he must know.
MARGOT
How can he know?
LAIRD
Have you talked to him about
Princeton yet?
90.
EXT. GARAGE - CONTINUOUS
Crispin pushes his weight on to the side mirror, trying to break it off. No luck.
PERCY
I’ll try.
CRISPIN
I’m way stronger. If I can’t do it, it can’t be done.
PERCY
I’ll kick it.
Percy kicks the mirror. Crispin joins in. Nothing.
CRISPIN
This thing’s a tank.
PERCY
The tools!
CRISPIN
Good idea.
Crispin pulls out a CROWBAR. He walks around the car, popping the hubcaps off. He examines his handiwork.
CRISPIN (CONT'D)
She’s gonna hate not having hubcaps.
PERCY
What else?
MOMENTS LATER
The CAR HOOD is up. Percy and Crispin examine it. Crispin is holding SCISSORS.
PERCY (CONT'D)
Which one’s the brake wire?
CRISPIN
No idea. We can cut every wire.
Crispin moves to cut a wire.
PERCY
Wait. Isn’t this dangerous?
CRISPIN
Not as dangerous as playing with a man’s heart.
(MORE)
91.
CRISPIN (CONT'D)
Try pulling that shit in the Middle East.
(picks up crowbar)
We can smash the windows then.
PERCY
They’ll hear that.
Percy leans against the front of the car, thinks.
PERCY (CONT'D)
Maybe this is a bad idea.
The Buick begins rolling backwards.
CRISPIN
Percy.
PERCY
No!
Crispin tries get a grip in order to slow the roll but can’t.
CRISPIN
It’s not stopping!
He grabs hold of the side mirror and is finally able to slow the car down. They both breathe a sigh of relief.
PERCY
That could’ve been bad.
CRACK!
The side mirror BREAKS OFF
THE BUICK
Descends the steep driveway... 
Gaining momentum... 
SMASHING through the wooden gates... 
Crossing the two lane highway... 
And disappearing over the bluffs... 
PERCY AND CRISPIN
Percy is motionless for a beat. Then a look of bewilderment comes over his face. He shoots a puzzled look to Crispin.
MOMENTS LATER
92.
Percy and Crispin run to the cliff’s edge and peer over.
THEIR POV
The Buick lies on the beach, upside down, one hundred feet below. A smoldering heap of metal.
PERCY AND CRISPIN
They stand there in shock. Crispin turns to Percy.
CRISPIN
That’ll teach her.
INT. PERCY’S HOUSE - DINING ROOM -	MOMENTS LATER
Percy shuffles in, dazed.
LAIRD
Hey! There he is.
Percy doesn’t even answer, just grabs the wine bottle and starts filling his glass.
ALLISON
Everything okay?
Percy gives his dad a “thumbs up”, fills the glass to the brim, then downs the entire glass.
MARGOT
You okay, Percy?
PERCY
(catching his breath)
I think I’m going to go lie down.
He gets up and walks out in a daze. Moments later, we hear the muffled roar of guitar POWER CHORDS from upstairs.
MARGOT
(to Laird and Allison)
I’ll go talk to him.
LAIRD
Make sure to bring up Princeton.
INT. BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Margot knocks, enters. Percy kicks out a metal guitar riff, fast, precise, punishing... 
93.
MARGOT
Percy? Can we talk?
He starts playing even faster. She unplugs the amp.
PERCY
I wasn’t done shredding.
MARGOT
What just happened down there?
She sits on the edge of his bed. He puts the guitar down, takes a shot of vermouth.
PERCY
I’m addicted to this shit now. The dry kind’s good too.
He sits beside Margot and immediately tries to kiss her.
MARGOT
What are you doing?
PERCY
Let’s fuck.
MARGOT
How about we talk?
PERCY
Later.
Percy stands, begins unbuttoning his shorts.
MARGOT
Percy, I’m trying to talk to you.
Percy starts pulling his shorts down. Margot grabs hold of them and pulls them back up. A short struggle ensues until --
PERCY
Ow, my wrist!
Percy gives up, lies down on the bed. Wounded teen energy.
MARGOT
Sorry. I care about you, Percy. But
I don’t think we should do this.
PERCY
Since when? Because you hit on me. You literally busted down the door to throw a girl out of bed so excuse me if I’m a little confused!
94.
Margot’s conflicted. Unable to be honest, but doesn’t want to hurt him.
PERCY (CONT'D)
If there’s something I don’t know, tell me. But if you want me to believe you actually care about me like you say you do... 
He looks her in the eye, waiting for an answer he doesn’t want to hear.
PERCY (CONT'D)
Well?
Long beat.
MARGOT
(quiet)
Is this really what you want?
PERCY
...  Yeah.
MARGOT
This will make you happy?
PERCY
Yup.
Long beat as Margot considers... 
MARGOT
Okay. Let’s do it.
PERCY
Great.
Percy gets under the covers. Margot joins him under the covers. Clothes come off.
PERCY (CONT'D)
Now what?
MARGOT
Get on top.
Percy crawls on top of her. She studies his face, trying to get a read on him. Percy starts thrusting.
MARGOT (CONT'D)
Whoa. Slow down, cowboy. Let me
help you in the saddle.
95.
Percy instead pumps faster.
MARGOT (CONT'D)
Percy, wait, you’re just stabbing
my hip bone.
Percy is a jack-rabbit now.
MARGOT (CONT'D)
Percy! You’re not even-
PERCY
GAAAAAAAH--
Percy rolls over, panting.
PERCY (CONT'D)
I did it.
MARGOT
Percy... . that was my thigh gap.
Margot grabs a STUFFED ANIMAL, wipes her thighs off.
PERCY
By the way, your car’s on the
beach. Crispin and I sent it over
the cliff.
MARGOT
What?
PERCY
Yeah. Sorry, but that’s the price of deception. That’s what Crispin said.
Margot’s face falls as she realizes he knows.
MARGOT
Percy... 
PERCY
It’s just like every single other
thing in my life -- planned by my
parents.
(then)
I had some kind of stupid idea that you liked me. That we were friends.
MARGOT
We are friends. No, that’s the
thing -- this is real.
96.
PERCY
I’m too nice. I am. I put too much faith in people. I think the truth is you can’t trust anybody.
MARGOT
(in pain)
Oh god.
PERCY
I don’t mean that in a bad way. Not like everyone is untrustworthy or something. Just like, don’t expect anything. Don’t expect anything and then you won’t be disappointed.
He hands Margot her clothes. She slips them on under the covers.
MARGOT
It wasn’t personal. I was just
trying to save my house.
PERCY
Feels personal to me.
MARGOT
I was desperate.
PERCY
Thanks. You should go.
(unable to help himself) The truth is, one day I’ll be living in Paris or something. And I’ll come back to visit Montauk and you’ll still be bartending or whatever. Because you’re trash. Townie fucking white trash.
Margot just stares at him for a long beat, then --
MARGOT
How much money do your parents
have?
PERCY
Why don’t you ask them? I know you guys are close.
MARGOT
But he’s rich, right? You don’t
have to worry about money?
He shuts his eyes, fighting tears.
97.
PERCY
And that makes my life amazing. I
have no problems.
MARGOT
I owe forty six thousand dollars in property taxes because people like your parents keep moving here. And I don’t have a rich dad to help me.
Percy opens his eyes, turns to Margot and fixes her with a hard stare.
PERCY
Well, you do. He just doesn’t want anything to do with you. And I don’t blame him.
He immediately regrets his words.
PERCY (CONT'D)
Wait. I didn’t meant that. Margot,
I’m sorry! Wait.
And with that, Margot leaves. Off Percy, alone.
FADE TO BLACK.
Bright white sunlight streams into --
INT. MARGOT'S BEDROOM - MORNING
Margot awakes to the sound of BEEPING.
EXT. MARGOT'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
Margot opens her front door to find Gary unloading the busted up Buick in Margot’s driveway. The side mirror is hanging by the wiring. The hubcaps are gone. A huge spidercrack runs across the windshield.
MARGOT
What’re you doing, Gary?
This isn’t my car!
GARY
(checks paperwork)
Your name’s on the title.
MARGOT
Well I don’t want it.
98.
GARY
Not my problem.
He unloads the Buicks, climbs back into the tow truck cab.
MARGOT
What am I supposed to do with a car that doesn’t run?
GARY
Who said it doesn’t run?
He tosses her the keys.
GARY (CONT'D)
Those things are built to last.
(still hurt)
Unlike us.
He drives away. She looks at the keys in her hand.
EXT. SURF LODGE - NIGHT
Two girls exit the hot spot, freeze when they see --
The Buick. Held together by duct tape. Margot stands outside it, smiling. She opens the back door like a chauffeur and motions inside. The girls hesitantly get in and Margot has to smash the car door shut several times to get it to close.
INT. BUICK - NIGHT
Margot Ubers a DRUNK COUPLE making out in her back seat. Her phone BUZZES with a phone call. It’s Percy. She hits ignore.
INT. PERCY’S ROOM - SAME
Percy sinks back into his bed. He puts headphones on, blinks away tears.
INT. BUICK - ANOTHER DAY
Margot drives. We HEAR Percy’s voice.
PERCY VOICEMAIL (O.S.) Hey, it’s me. I really miss you. I’m sorry about what I said. I was just mad about the whole betrayal thing. It’s probably my fault, I dunno.
(MORE)
99.
PERCY VOICEMAIL (O.S.) (CONT'D)
I just wish we could talk about what happened. I’m just really confused. But sounds like maybe you don’t want to. Um...  okay, I miss you. I’m around.
(then)
It’s Percy.
CLICK. Margot hits the trash icon. We hear “MESSAGE DELETED.” Another message comes on.
VOICEMAIL (O.S.)
Yo, it’s Frank. I had a lot of fun with you the other night. There’s a new restaurant I wanna take you to called--
Margot hits a button. “MESSAGE DELETED.”
FADE TO BLACK.
INT. MARGOT'S HOUSE - DAY
Margot at her laptop, a spreadsheet open. The date tells us we’re now in mid-August. The DOORBELL rings.
I/E. MARGOT’S HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - MOMENTS LATER
Margot spies through the peephole, sees Jean standing there, sighs then opens the door. He’s in a suit.
MARGOT
I knew it! Alright, let’s hear it.
(helping him along)
“My name is Jean and I’m a
registered-”
JEAN
Remember when I said I worked for
the government?
Beat. Margot looks at him, nervously.
MARGOT
You CIA?
JEAN
Worse.
(hands her an envelops) IRS. And I have friends at the Suffolk County’s assessor’s office.
(MORE)
100.
JEAN (CONT'D)
And your property taxes are going
up. Way up.
INT. THE LOBSTER CLAW - NIGHT
Henry, Sara and Margot have a post-work nightcap at the bar.
MARGOT
That old nanny really fucked me. I was on track too. I don’t know what I’m gonna do next year.
HENRY
Just sell it. Your place is way nicer than ours. You’ll never have to worry about money again.
MARGOT
(good-natured)
Who would protect you from Sara?
Sara and Henry share a look.
MARGOT (CONT'D)
What’s that look?
HENRY
Sara has something she wants to
tell you.
SARA
Thanks, Henry.
(sighs, to Margot)
We’re selling our house.
MARGOT
Oh.
SARA
We’re moving to Florida. It’s closer to Henry’s parents. It’ll be nice to have the help with the babies... 
MARGOT
You’re selling?
HENRY
This market is on fire. Remember Doug Hines? The guy with the red Miata who fucked the Spanish teacher? He’s our broker. He’s good.
101.
MARGOT
You’re letting these people run you out of town.
SARA
We’re choosing to move on with our lives. This is what makes sense for us.
MARGOT
If you say so. My mom would have
wanted me to fight for my house.
SARA
Your mom wanted you to be happy.
And you don’t seem happy.
MARGOT
(angry)
I am happy!
SARA
You’ll figure it out. You always do.
INT. BOSTWICK YACHT CLUB - NIGHT
It’s happy hour. Margot, dressed elegantly, sits at the bar and looks around. Various YOUNG WOMEN with OLDER MEN populate the restaurant.
A few of the older men look Margot’s way, but she avoids making any prolonged eye contact.
LATER
Margot sits at the bar, nursing a martini. The HANDSOME OLDER MAN she saw with Melanie earlier comes in, bellies up to the other side of the bar.
OLDER MAN
Hey Jeff. The usual.
He pulls out the Wall Street Journal. Margot eyes him intently. The Bartender comes over.
BARTENDER
Anything else?
MARGOT
Nope. And you can put this on his tab.
The bartender nods, brings the bill over to the older man and whispers to him. He nods to the bartender and clocks Margot.
102.
She fixes her hair and downs her drink as he approaches.
OLDER MAN
(off empty chair)
May I?
She nods and he sits.
MARGOT
(nervous)
Hi.
OLDER MAN
(smiles warmly)
Hi.
(then)
Are you nervous?
MARGOT
Actually, yeah.
OLDER MAN
What’s your name?
Beat. Margot just looks at him sadly.
OLDER MAN (CONT'D)
(thrown)
What’s wrong?
MARGOT
Guess I was hoping you’d recognize me.
He looks at her quizically.
MARGOT (CONT'D)
Because I recognize you -- every
time I run away from a mess I
created. Every time I choose the
easy way out and hurt somebody
because of it.
She pulls out the letter, slides it over to him. His face falls as he realizes.
OLDER MAN
(off letter)
So what are you here for? Money?
MARGOT
No. I’m here for closure. I’ve been waiting for you to explain why you disappeared on us. Then I realized you were never going to do that.
(MORE)
103.
MARGOT (CONT'D)
So I’m here to tell you I’m done
waiting and I’m moving on with my
life.
(then)
Thanks for the drinks.
She walks off.

A mechanic pulls out the Buick. It’s been completely fixed, good as new. Margot smiles, impressed by the work. She gets in, sees “Montauk Towing” directly across the street. Gary walks to his truck.
MARGOT
(to Mechanic)
I’ll be right back.
We stay in the car as Margot gets out and jogs over to Gary.
EXT. MONTAUK TOWING - MOMENTS LATER
Gary stiffens, nervously glances about at the sight of Margot. Margot says something to him. Gary nods. She keeps speaking to him. He looks down, nods some more. Margot now hugs him. He hesitates, then hugs her back.
104.
INT. BEST FRIENDS - DAY
Crispin plays with Milo, the former drug dog. Margot enters.
MARGOT
Hey. Is he here?
CRISPIN
No. He quit.
MARGOT
(deflates)
He won’t return my calls or texts.
Will you tell him I was here?
CRISPIN
Absolutely fucking not.
MARGOT
Really?
CRISPIN
Yeah. Really.
Margot nods, heads to the exit and opens the door.
MARGOT
(yells back in store)
COCAINE!
Milo goes insane, barking into Crispin’s face.

Margot pulls up to the gate, hits the intercom.
MARGOT
Hi, it’s Margot. Can I talk to him?

(disappointed)
Oh. Okay. I understand.
ALLISON
(beat)
But why don’t you come up?
DRIVEWAY - MOMENTS LATER
Margot and Allison talk in the driveway.
105.
ALLISON (CONT'D)
You wouldn’t believe it. He’s never home anymore. And he got his license. He’s seeing someone.
(whispers)
He’s not a virgin anymore.
MARGOT
What kind of car did she get?
ALLISON
About that. He’s still pretty upset with us. Understandable.
(introspective)
Maybe sometimes we try to do too
much for him.
MARGOT
Nooooo.
ALLISON
Am I detecting sarcasm?
MARGOT
A	little.
(then)
I’m glad to hear he’s doing well.
It’s a relief.
EXT. MARGOT’S HOUSE - DAY
Henry, Sara and Fern help Margot finish loading up a U-Haul trailer. Henry slides the trailer door closed.
HENRY
That’s the last of it.
MARGOT
Thanks for helping me.

Thanks for giving us all your furniture.
Margot looks at the house.
SARA
You want to take a last look? Make sure you didn’t forget anything?

As Margot watches the house recede in the side view mirror.

EXT. STREET - BENCH -	MOMENTS LATER
Margot walks up.
MARGOT
What’s wrong?
Natalie looks up, flinches. Margot sits down beside her.
MARGOT (CONT'D)
You okay?
NATALIE
(shakes her head)
It’s Percy.
MARGOT
(alarmed)
What happened?? Is he okay?
NATALIE
No. He’s an asshole!
MARGOT
(beat)
Percy?
NATALIE
Ugh, we started hanging out a couple weeks ago. It was really fun. And...  we ended up having sex. I thought he was my boyfriend. And then I found out he was talking to two other girls.
107.
MARGOT
Again, this is Percy we’re talking about?
NATALIE
When I asked him about it he
totally cut off contact. He just
disappeared. He was never like
this. I don’t get it.
Margot deflates.
MARGOT
This is my fault. I created a fuck boi.
NATALIE
I feel like an idiot. I got all
dressed up and he completely
ignored me.
MARGOT
(realizing)
Just now?
INT. BUICK - MOMENTS LATER
Margot drives, Natalie rides shotgun.
NATALIE
It’s up here on the right.
Margot pulls over and parks. Shuts the engine off.
MARGOT
I’m sorry about that night at the
party. I shouldn’t have yelled at
you like that.
(then)
I was drunk.
NATALIE
That’s what I thought.
MARGOT
(sighs)
No. I wasn’t. I was just...  shitty.
NATALIE
That’s what I thought.
(then)
How are you gonna get in? There’s a guest list.
108.
Margot reaches for Natalie’s name tag, peels it off. She flinches.
NATALIE (CONT'D)
I’m still scared of you.
INT. HAMPTONS MANSION - LATER
Hedge fund money. Margot, now with Natalie’s name tag affixed, walks through the mixer looking for Percy. Most of the middle-aged ATTENDEES are stealing glances at Margot.
She sees Laird and Allison, quickly turns, walks a different direction. She spots Percy with other INCOMING FRESHMAN listening to several RECENT ALUMNI.
RECENT ALUM #1
And there’s several Eating Clubs to choose from.
RECENT ALUM #2
If you make it to junior year.
Lame laughter. Margot walks over joining with laughter.
MARGOT
Well I can’t wait to get eaten at
Princeton.
Percy freezes, terrified. The other guys all check her out.
RECENT ALUM #1
You’re a prospective student?
MARGOT
Yeah, Princeton’s my safety school.
She grabs Percy by the arm and drags him off.
MARGOT (CONT'D)
I’ve been trying to get in touch
with you.
He yanks his arm away, heads for the exit.
EXT. DRIVEWAY - CONTINUOUS
Percy walks to his car, Margot catches up.
MARGOT
Please don’t shut me out.
109.
PERCY
I don’t owe you anything!
MARGOT
But I owe you something. I walked away, left you to your anger and your grief. I’m sorry, Percy. I’m so sorry.
Percy walks up to a Volvo SUV, gets in. She approaches, goes for the handle. He locks it before she can open the door.
MARGOT (CONT'D)
Open the door, Percy.
He starts the car, begins to pull away. She impulsively jumps on the hood.
MARGOT (CONT'D)
Stop!
He brakes.
MARGOT (CONT'D)
Just get out and talk to me.
PERCY
Get off the car. I don’t want
anything to do with you. I don’t
want to be in your shitty life.
MARGOT
I know my life might seem kind of depressing to you, and you know, in a lot of ways it is. But there’s some good stuff in it. Maybe I never told you about it, but there’s some really good stuff in my life. And a lot of it has to do with you. The time we spent together still matters, even if it was a lie, because you felt something honest and pure for someone else.
PERCY
Fine, we’ll do it your way.
EXT. HAMPTONS MANSION - CATERING TRUCK AREA - MOMENTS LATER
Caterers on their smoke break look up as Percy, with Margot on his hood, pass them.
110.
MARGOT
The Percy I met at the beginning of the summer wouldn’t have done that to Natalie watch it--
The other driver swerves, HONKS. Percy casually flips him off. With Margot obscuring his view, he misses the turn to the main road and blindly turns onto a sandy --
BEACH PATH
Margot clings to the hood. A war of wills.
MARGOT (CONT'D)
Fuck. This is scary. I can’t
believe you did this.
PERCY
You’re blocking my line of sight!
MARGOT
Well I’m not getting off until you promise you won’t be like me!
Percy swerves into a few trash cans. Garbage flies up onto Margot and the windshield. He puts on the windshield wipers. They smack her in the face.
PERCY
Had enough!?
MARGOT
No! Promise me!
BEACH
He drives through some beach umbrellas. They smack Margot in the face and body. She maintains her grip.
MARGOT (CONT'D)
Promise you won’t be like me!
Percy keeps driving. Margot looks back, sees several PARTYGOERS drinking around a BONFIRE.
MARGOT (CONT'D)
(looking back)
Um, Percy?
People scatter as the Volvo careens towards the bonfire.
WHOOSH
111.
The car runs through the bonfire. They emerge on the other side, with Margot partially on fire.
MARGOT (CONT'D)
Ahhhhhh!
PERCY
Oh shit!
He pulls a hard left, heads right toward the ocean, then SLAMS on the breaks. Margo goes flying into the ocean, disappears under the water.
Percy rushes out of the car. He pulls her from the shallows.
They fall onto the sand, panting, exhausted.
EXT. BEACH - LATER
Margot and Percy sit on the sand.
PERCY
I can’t believe you jumped on my hood.
MARGOT
I can’t believe you drove with me
on your hood.
PERCY
I can’t believe you didn’t let go.
MARGOT
I can’t believe you got your license.
PERCY
I can’t believe you sold your house.
MARGOT
...  Yeah.
Beat.
PERCY
Where are you gonna go?
MARGOT
California, to start. After that--
She shurgs, happy.
PERCY
You got a car?
112.
MARGOT
Actually I fixed up the Buick.
PERCY
(laughs)
Wow. That thing was busted to hell.
MARGOT
It looked busted, but it was solid inside. It just needed some love.
Percy nods. They look out at the water for a beat.
MARGOT (CONT'D)
I should go.
She stands. He stands.
PERCY
Are you coming back?
Margot shrugs.
PERCY (CONT'D)
If you do, say hi. If you’re horny or whatever. I’m kidding.
She laughs. Natalie approaches from the beach entrance.
MARGOT
Be nice to her.
Percy nods.
MARGOT (CONT'D)
Well, I guess this is it.
They stand for a beat...  Then Margot embraces him with fierce intimacy. They hold each other for a long beat.
PERCY
Margot?
MARGOT
(turns back)
Yeah?
PERCY
I promise.
Percy goes and sits down next to Natalie. He takes his hand in hers as the sun goes down over the water.
113.
EXT. MONTAUK - LATER
The Buick passes a “Leaving Montauk” sign. Margot smiles, finally free.
FADE OUT.
