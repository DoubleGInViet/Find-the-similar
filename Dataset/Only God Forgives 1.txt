The SOUND of Muay Thai boxing ...  The Art of Eight Limbs...  Thrust and move...  Feet shuffling across the ring... 
FADE IN:
INT. BACK ROOM - NIGHT
CLOSE ON a pair of hands from VARIOUS ANGLES... 
The SOUNDS of the fighting grow LOUDER. Punches, kicks, elbows... 
The hands tense into fists. They're strong hands. Fighter's hands.
ZOOM OUT TO REVEAL Julian (mid-thirties) staring at his hands.
Even though he's kept in shape, he hasn't fought for a long time.
The SOUND of the boxing match gets LOUDER STILL as Julian continues staring at his hands - it's almost as if he's meditating. Suddenly he breaths in.
Behind him sits a young kid dressed in Thai boxing clothes - this is Liang, barely sixteen. He looks nervous, occasionally glancing at Julian's reflection through the huge mirror that hangs on the far wall.
Julian continues to stare at his hands and closes them into a tight fist.
CUT TO:
INT. CORRIDORS - NIGHT
The SOUNDS of the boxing match reach FEVER PITCH as we TRACK WITH Julian and Liang making their way towards the ring.
CUT TO:
INT. THAI BOXING RING - NIGHT
Two Young Thai Boxers beat the crap out of each other.
The crowd is wild with excitement, people placing bets on which way the fight will turn.
One of the Thai Boxers goes down and money immediately starts changing hands... 
The ring is cleared and Liang jumps in as Julian pushes his way though the crowd, nodding at people as he passes. They know him here.
Again bets are placed... .
PICK OUT a face in the crowd. Billy. Julian's older brother (late thirties).
Julian sits down next to Billy who's delighted to see him, throwing his arm around him, pulling him in close.
BILLY
...  I love violence!
Billy offers Julian a hit from his bottle of Mehkong whiskey.
Julian refuses. He's more interested in the fight.
BACK TO THE RING where the fight has just started. Liang is immediately on the ropes.
Julian watches, concerned.
Billy takes a phone call but he can't hear. He nods to Julian and takes it outside.
BACK TO THE FIGHT where Liang pulls an amazing move. Turns the tables. Takes the bigger man down with a series of jabs, swings and backfists.
As Julian applauds Liang's success, Billy slinks off out of the auditorium.
Liang wins the fight with a knock out...  The crowd go wild with adulation... 
Julian watches, transfixed... 
Liang is lit up by a beatific white light...  As he stands triumphant
in the middle of the ring, the crowd start to gather round him... 
Julian continues to stare at what's taking place before him... 
...  Which is almost like a religious ceremony...  The audience
bow down before Liang as he stares out into the light...  A look
of calm washing over his face...  A sense of stillness and peace... 
Enlightenment through victory and violence... 
CUT TO:
EXT. BANGKOK STREETS - NIGHT
Billy stalks the streets of the city of vice.	A man on a mission.
CUT TO:
INT. CHANGING ROOMS - NIGHT
Liang is sitting on a bench, his constantly-smiling Mother beside him, as Julian peels off fifty Bhat notes.
We get the sense that Julian's proud of him, that Liang is something of a protege of his and that Liang is incredibly pleased to have gained his approval.
JULIAN
Two fifty, three hundred... 
Liang takes the money. Julian pulls off two more notes. A bonus.
JULIAN (CONT'D)
You did well out there. You've got something, Liang. Potential, yeah?
Liang nods.
JULIAN (CONT'D)
Don't spend it all in once place.
CUT TO:
EXT. BACK ALLEY - NIGHT
Billy comes down a back ally and knocks on a door. After a moment the door opens.
The Doorman recognises him and lets him enter.
CUT TO:
INT. UNDERGROUND NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT
WE TRACK with Billy as he makes his way through the small subterranean nightclub.
A Thai man - known as The Lizard - sits by a table with a few locals gambling... 
He spots Billy and follows him with his eyes as he continues to gamble.
Billy moves across to a small private corner... 
...  where he meets various men and women, all smoking Methamphetamine. Billy joins in but an argument quickly starts up between him and another Thai Man.
The music's too loud to hear what they're arguing about but it suddenly gets out of control...  Billy starts viciously hitting the Thai Man and quickly the room EXPLODES in a frenzy of violence.
CUT TO:
INT. BACK ROOM - NIGHT
A fan does what it can to cool Julian down as he counts out money at his desk. Sitting opposite him, feet on the table, is Gordon, Julian's lieutenant and the closest thing to a friend he's got... 
Julian's phone rings. He interrupts his counting. Picks up and listens... 
JULIAN
(ON THE PHONE)
Hold on, hold on. What did he say?
Beat as Julian listens. He glances over at Gordon who looks up, concerned.
JULIAN (CONT'D)
(ON THE PHONE)
No, tell him to stay there. Tell them both to stay there.
Beat.
JULIAN (CONT'D)
(ON THE PHONE)
I'm coming over.
CUT TO:
EXT. BACK ALLEY - NIGHT
The Lizard sits outside the nightclub, somehow managing to smoke a cigarette at the same time as he stems the flow of blood from his nose with a handkerchief.
Julian and Gordon arrive.
JULIAN
He still in there?
THE LIZARD
...  No.
Beat...  Julian glances at Gordon.
JULIAN
You told him I was coming... 
THE LIZARD
Wouldn't listen... 
Julian stares at him... 
JULIAN
Well maybe you didn't try hard enough.
The Lizard takes the handkerchief away from his nose. Shows the bloodstain to Julian.
JULIAN (CONT'D)
When was the last time you slept?
The Lizard smiles but stares at Julian with hatred in his eyes.
THE LIZARD
Just cause I ain't slept for three days, don't mean I don't know right from wrong...  and your brother has become a real problem... 
Again Julian stares at him - clenching his fist. The Lizard notices this but gazes up into Julian's face blankly.
THE LIZARD (CONT'D)
You're not going to cause another
ruckus in my club now - are you?
A long pause as Julian considers it.
JULIAN
No.
THE LIZARD
Good - 'cause Billy ripped me off and
then he broke my face... 
Julian turns to Gordon.
GORDON
Like I always said. One day he's going to meet the devil.
Beat.
JULIAN
You know where he is now?
The Lizard stares at Julian.
THE LIZARD
Bangkok has millions of people my friend. You and your brother, you're lost to my world... 
The Lizard gets up - puts out his cigarette and looks at Julian... 
THE LIZARD (CONT'D)
So what you going to do? You wanna come in? Very good amphetamine in here... 
Julian looks over to Gordon. Sees he's keen.
JULIAN
You go. I'm gonna look around. See if
I can find him.
GORDON
Sure--?
JULIAN
Go on.
He turns back to The Lizard.
JULIAN (CONT'D)
Which way'd he go?
The Lizard nods his head towards the busy street. Julian turns and heads off...  Gordon steps up to the entrance to the club. The Lizard sticks out an arm, blocking his way.
THE LIZARD
His brother didn't pay.
GORDON
So? That's his problem.
THE LIZARD
Now it's your problem.
GORDON
I'm with you mate. Billy's fucked--
THE LIZARD
You don't pay his debt - you don't enter.
Gordon thinks for beat. Takes out his money... 
GORDON
How much... ?
... and The Lizard smiles for the first time.
CUT TO:
INT. MA LONG'S BROTHEL - NIGHT
Julian is talking to Ma Long, fifties, the mother figure to a group of girls who stand in the background.
JULIAN
You seen Billy?
MA LONG
Not this evening.
A particularly pretty prostitute catches Juilan's eye. He stares at her, stone faced.
JULIAN
Well if he comes in, tell him I'm looking for him, yeah?
MA LONG
He's not coming in. I tell him to stay away. He hurt one of my girls Julian. Not good... 
Julian considers. Pulls out his wad of notes again. Hands a few to Ma Long.
JULIAN
Yeah, well...  if you see him, tell him
I'm looking for him... 
Ma Long nods as she takes the money.
Julian is about to leave. He looks at the pretty prostitute again.
Stares at her for a moment. Then walks out.
CUT TO:
EXT. BANGKOK STREETS - NIGHT
Billy's so wasted he's bumping into people. He starts window shopping the various brothels that line the street: groups of girls smiling at him...  Anything for a price... 
PICK OUT one particularly young-looking girl. Just fifteen.
She makes eye contact with Billy...  He smiles...  Pulls out a roll of notes... 
CUT TO:
EXT. BANGKOK STREETS - NIGHT
Julian out in the middle of the road. Girls on the pavement, girls in the windows. A steady line of punters cruising past.
He stands alone. Focussed. Watchful. An island in a sea of neon.
It feels ominous. Like something really bad's about to happen... 
CUT TO:
ONLY GOD FORGIVES
FADE IN:
INT. TAXI - NIGHT
CLOSE ON Chang, mid-forties, a man who looks like he's carved out of stone. The neon lights bleed over his face in a seemingly unending flow as he's driven towards his destination.
CUT TO:
EXT. SEEDY HOTEL - NIGHT
Police cars are parked up outside. Chang gets out of his taxi.
Pays the driver. Makes his way inside.
CUT TO:
INT. SEEDY HOTEL - NIGHT
Chang makes his way up the stairs to a landing where a GROUP OF POLICEMEN are gathered. Their circle opens up as Chang approaches and they bow as he joins them - like he's a God. One of the group, Kim Han Ho, gestures towards the door of Room 610 where TWO COPS stand guard. Chang gives a nod and the door is opened.
CUT TO:
INT. ROOM 610 - NIGHT
Chang stands silhouetted in the doorway. Stepping into the room he moves into the light in CLOSE UP. His face is a mask.
The bed is drenched in blood. The fifteen year old prostitute lies naked on her back. She's dead, her body having been savagely beaten in some sort of brutal sex game gone wrong.
Billy is slumped in the corner in his underpants, his eyes glazed, staring at MTV, a bottle of Mehkong whiskey in his hand, a crack pipe on the floor.
Chang stares at him, giving nothing away.
CUT TO:
INT. ROOM 611 - NIGHT
The Hotel Owner serves tea to Chang who sits in silence with Lieutenant Kim. The door is open and we can see into room 610 across the corridor where Billy is still sat staring at the television.
CUT TO:
INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT
A young cop, Daeng, who has been watching Chang, summons up courage to whisper to his superior officer, Phaiban.
DAENG
(IN THAI)
Who is that guy?
Phaiban says nothing.
DAENG (CONT'D)
(IN THAI)
Is he a cop?
PHAIBAN
(IN THAI)
He was... 
Before Daeng can ask another questions, two more cops lead an older Thai man, Choi Yan Lee (50's, overweight, dragged straight from his bed) down the corridor towards the crime scene.
CUT TO:
INT. ROOM 611 - NIGHT
As Choi Yan Lee is delivered to the doorway, Chang gets up and goes over to him.
A moment of uncertainty in Choi Yan Lee's face. Fear. He doesn't know why he's been brought here. He looks for some comfort from Chang. Chang gives him nothing.
CUT TO:
INT. ROOM 610 - NIGHT
Chang leads Choi Yan Lee to the doorway. Slowly Choi Yan Lee realises what he's looking at. His daughter. Dead. Mutilated.
Every father's worst nightmare.
CHANG
(IN THAI)
Is this your daughter?
Beat.
CHOI YAN LEE
(IN THAI)
Yes.
CHANG
(IN THAI)
How could you?
...  but Choi Yan Lee just stares at his daughter. Finally:
CHOI YAN LEE
(IN THAI)
...  What?
CHANG
(IN THAI)
How could you let this happen?
CHOI YAN LEE
(IN THAI)
I didn't do anything.
CHANG
(IN THAI)
Well now's your chance.
A long moment between them as Choi Yan Lee fails to understand what Chang is suggesting. Chang stands back.
CHANG (CONT'D)
(IN THAI)
Do what thou will.
Choi Yan Lee nods. Chang leaves the room, closing the door behind him.
CUT TO:
INT. ROOM 611 - NIGHT
Chang sits drinking tea in silence with Lieutenant Kim. The guards in the corridor stare at the closed door of Room 610 from where we hear the cries of Billy being beaten to death.
ANGLE ON: Daeng who's starting to look scared. Phaiban puts a reassuring hand on his shoulder.
As the beating reaches its climax, with Choi Yan Lee screaming out Thai obscenities, we hear the sickening sound of Billy's neck snapping. And then a regular thud as blow after blow rain down on his body.
CUT TO:
INT. ROOM 610 - NIGHT
Chang opens the door and looks through.
Choi Yan Lee is sitting breathlessly on the floor covered in blood.
In his hand he holds a piece of wood he has ripped from a chair.
Billy lies dead, his head completely smashed in.
CUT TO:
EXT. BANGKOK - NIGHT
A police car drives through the city streets and onto the freeway heading out of town.
CUT TO:
INT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT
The bloodied Choi Yan Lee sits in the back, Chang on one side,
Kim on the other. As the police car turns onto a more major road,
Choi Yan Lee starts to get nervous.
CHOI YAN LEE
(IN THAI)
You missed my turning. I live that way.
Beat. Chang says nothing. Phaiban is driving, Daeng in the passenger seat. Daeng looks back at them through the rearview mirror... 
KIM
(IN THAI)
We'll get you there.
CUT TO:
EXT. BANGKOK - NIGHT
The Police Car heads over the Mega Bridge and continues its way out of town.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT
The bright white headlights of the stationary police car blind Choi Yan Lee who's caught in their glare, rigid with fear.
CHOI YAN LEE
(IN THAI)
I'm so sorry. Please. Please. Please don't hurt me. I'm so sorry.
CHANG
(IN THAI)
What are you sorry for?
CHOI YAN LEE
(IN THAI)
I thought...  You were there. He killed my daughter. I thought you were letting me... 
CHANG
(IN THAI)
Answer the question. What are you sorry for?
Beat. Choi Yan Lee is wrongfooted. Tentatively... 
CHOI YAN LEE
(IN THAI)
I killed the Westerner?
CHANG
(IN THAI)
And why did you do that?
CHOI YAN LEE
(IN THAI)
He killed my daughter.
CHANG
(IN THAI)
And why did he do that?
Choi Yan Lee can't answer.
CHANG (CONT'D)
(IN THAI)
How old was she?
CHOI YAN LEE
(IN THAI)
Fifteen... 
CHANG
(IN THAI)
You knew what she was doing and you did nothing.
CHOI YAN LEE
(IN THAI)
How else can we make money? Four daughters. No sons. What else could I do?
Daeng watches as Kim opens the boot and pulls something out. He walks towards Chang and hands it to him. Daeng sees that it's an axe.
CHOI YAN LEE (CONT'D)
(IN THAI)
What did you expect me to do? You have to have pity on me. My daughter's just been murdered.
CHANG
(IN THAI)
This isn't about her. This is about your other three daughters and making sure you don't forget them.
Chang nods to Kim and Phaiban who grab hold of Choi Yan Lee. Kim slips a plastic strap around Choi Yan Lee's arm, using it as a tourniquet. They wrestle him to the ground and pull his arm out.
CHOI YAN LEE
(IN THAI)
I won't forget. I promise. Forgive me.
Chang approaches with the axe. He stops for a moment. Looks down at him... 
CHOI YAN LEE (CONT'D)
(IN THAI)
I'll change. I'll be a better man.
CHANG
(IN THAI)
I know.
Chang slams down the axe, severing Choi Yan Lee's arm at the elbow.
Choi Yan Lee SCREAMS in agony.
CUT TO:
INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
The anonymity of a hotel room. Julian opens the curtains and we see the sky line of Bangkok - he looks out.
He lies back on the bed, surfing through two hundred TV channels.
Settles on a boxing match. Starts drifting off... 
As he drifts we hear the SOUND OF SINGING. A karaoke rendition of 'I Hung My Head' by Johnny Cash.
VOICE
I set off running
to wake from the dream
My brother's rifle
went into the sheen
I kept on running
Into the south lands
That's where they found me
My head in my hands
CUT TO:
INT. KARAOKE BAR - NIGHT
REVEAL that the voice is that of Chang and he's not half bad either: deeper than you'd have though, and with it comes a stage presence, a sort of John Wayne swagger... 
CHANG
The sheriff he asked me
Why I had run
And then it came to me
Just what I had done
And all for no reason
Just one piece of lead
I hung my head
I hung my head.
The policemen, still dressed in their uniforms, watch in respectful silence. Daeng sits with them. He too watches in awe.
CUT TO:
INT. SKYTRAIN - DAWN
Chang travels home across the city.
CUT TO:
INT. CHANG'S APARTMENT / LANDING - MORNING
Chang opens the door as quietly as he can. He slips off his shoes and walks gingerly into the apartment.
CUT TO:
INT. CHANG'S APARTMENT / KITCHEN - MORNING
On the kitchen table Chang sees a picture. A badly-drawn house with a man, a woman and a child. Across the bottom: "LOVE YOU DADDY FROM DAUGHTER AND WIFE XXX'
Chang stares at it and smiles - picks it up and pins it to the fridge with a magnet.
CUT TO:
INT. CHANG'S HOUSE / KANITA'S BEDROOM - DAY
Chang and Kanita, his eight year old daughter, are playing with her dolls who have captured a soft toy.
CHANG
(IN THAI)
So now that they've caught him...  What are they going to do?
Kanita thinks for a moment.
KANITA
(IN THAI)
Put him in jail.
CHANG
(IN THAI)
Come on. They haven't got a jail big enough. Look at the size of him.
Again Kanita thinks.
KANITA
(IN THAI)
Keep him as a pet?
CHANG
(IN THAI)
But he blew down all their houses. Would you want to keep a pet that could do that?
Kanita shakes her head.
KANITA
(IN THAI)
What if they just let him go?
CHANG
(IN THAI)
How could they be sure he wouldn't do it again?
KANITA
(IN THAI)
They could ask him... ? Very nicely?
Chang picks up the soft toy. Peels off a sticker from a sheet and places it between its eyes. Satisfied with his work he puts the soft toy back in the middle of the game.
CHANG
(IN THAI)
"And so the king and the fairies that lived in the village said to the creature: this is your mark which will stay with you forever. If you ever try and blow down our village again, it will heat up until it boils your brains, for it has magical properties. Go in peace.
Kanita nods, happy with the judgement. She picks the soft toy up and 'walks' it away from the village of the dolls.
CUT TO:
INT. CHANG'S APARTMENT / MAIN BEDROOM - DAY
Chang walks into his bedroom where his wife Nadee is just waking up. He kisses her good morning.
As he starts to undress, she starts to get dressed. They share a smile about this. Finally Chang lies down on the bed and closes his eyes. Nadee kisses him good night.
CUT TO:
INT. CHANG'S APARTMENT / KITCHEN - DAY
Nadee starts making breakfast as Kanita watches cartoons.
CUT TO:
INT. CHANG'S APARTMENT / BEDROOM - DAY
As Chang sleeps the heavy curtains are drawn to keep out the light of the day - but they cannot deaden the sound of the city outside as it goes about its frenetic everyday business.
The CAMERA MOVES through the apartment, briefly settling on the sleeping Chang, then roaming through the various rooms, PICKING OUT different objects... 
We see that Chang is obsessed with cowboy films and a keen collector
-	the sitting room is stuffed with movie posters, photographs and other bits of movie memorabilia... 
Amongst the many family photos we also PICK OUT several pictures of Chang when he was in the army and shots of what looks like a very successful career as a Thai boxer.
At the end of the tour we're back with Chang. We ZOOM IN to a tight CLOSE SHOT.
CUT TO:
INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY
We see a hotel room door and hear a knock - Julian ENTERS FRAME and opens to reveal... 
... Two Thai girls - one being Mai - standing in the hallway. Julian lets them enter.
Mai embraces Julian, kissing him on the mouth as Julian closes the door.
They turn to consider the other girl who is starting to undress.
She smiles compliantly, eager to please.
Julian turns back to Mai and kisses her again. As the kiss becomes more passionate, the other girl joins them and the three of them begin to have sex.
CUT TO:
INT. CHANG'S APARTMENT - DAY
Chang is sitting eating alone at the dinning table, watching an old western on TV.
CUT TO:
EXT. BANGKOK STREETS - DAY
Chang walks down the streets towards a school. Standing at the gate, Kanita is waiting for him. He hugs her and they hold hands as they continue down the crowded street.
CUT TO:
INT. TOY STORE - DAY
Chang waits patiently at the counter as Kanita sorts through various dolls, trying to choose which one to buy... 
Chang looks round and gazes out the window into the street where pedestrians stream past. Suddenly Chang has a strange VISION:
All the women disappear. In the street there are only men.
We cut to a CLOSE UP of Chang and then back to his VISION again:
Now all the men have gone and he can see only women.
Back to the CLOSE UP of Chang who continues staring out of the window:
...  where everything is back to normal. Men and women walking up and down the sidewalk.
CUT TO:
INT. HOTEL ROOM - DUSK
The remnants of various room service orders litter the floor along with the trappings of a heavy session: empty bottles of alcohol, drug paraphernalia, etc.
Julian lies sleeping, entwined in the limbs of the girl... 
There is a knock on the door. Julian and the girl ignore it.
A pause and then Julian's mobile phone starts ringing. He doesn't answer.
The knocking starts up again, this time louder. Finally:
JULIAN
Julian's not here mate. Fuck off... 
Beat - then we hear a voice from behind the door.
GORDON (O.S.)
Julian?
Still they ignore him. Either too wasted or too tired to do anything else.
GORDON (O.S.) (CONT'D)
Julian... ? I need to talk with you... 
Beat. Finally Julian answers with zero energy... 
JULIAN
What is it?
GORDON (O.S.)
It's about Billy... 
JULIAN
I can't deal with my brother right now... 
Beat.
GORDON (O.S.)
He's dead... 
Julian opens his eyes, confused - still out of his head on drugs.
JULIAN
What?
No answer. Finally Julian gets up and wraps a towel around his body and slowly opens the door.
Gordon stands in the hallway - behind him two Thai men from Julian's crew.
JULIAN (CONT'D)
What happened?
GORDON
They found his body in a hotel room... 
Julian doesn't know what to say...  Neither does Gordon.
GORDON (CONT'D)
Look, get dressed and I'll see you downstairs.
Julian nods and closes the door. He stands still - glances out the window - seeing the sun setting and the night coming in. He glances at the pretty girl still sleeping on the bed.
He goes into the bathroom where Mai is dressed and putting on make up.
MAI
What happened?
Julian looks at her.
JULIAN
Someone killed Billy... 
The camera ZOOMS IN on Mai.
CUT TO:
INT. MORGUE - NIGHT
A Mortuary Attendant pulls a sheet back to reveal -
Billy. His body completely mutilated.
Julian stares at his brother's corpse intensely, not betraying any emotion.
He turns to Gordon who's standing behind him.
GORDON
What do we do?
JULIAN
For now...  We wait.
Julian glances back at the body... 
CUT TO:
EXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT
Julian stares up at the night sky, his mobile phone gripped tightly in his hand. He puts the phone down.
He looks out across the city again then back to the phone.
It's like he's scared.
He picks it up quickly and dials. A moment as it rings then it's answered.
JULIAN
Hello Mum.
Beat.
JULIAN (CONT'D)
It's me...  Julian...  Something's
happened.
CUT TO:
INT. FOUR SEASON'S HOTEL - DAY
The CAMERA tracks as we follow a pair of high heeled shoes belonging to an elegant woman in her fifties, who looks like she's in her forties and could actually pass for late thirties. She strides
towards reception, a Porter struggling to keep up with her. This is Jenna Hopkins. Head of a notorious London Crime Family. Mother of both Julian and Billy. Newly appointed Lady Macbeth of Bangkok. She hands her passport over to the Concierge.
JENNA
I'd like to check in now please.
The Concierge checks the computer.
CONCIERGE
I'm afraid the room won't be ready until four o'clock.
Beat...  Jenna just stares at him... 
CONCIERGE (CONT'D)
...  It's policy
JENNA
I'd like to speak to your manager.
Beat.
CONCIERGE
Yes of course... 
The Concierge retreats. Jenna lights a cigarette.
MANAGER
Good afternoon madam, what seems to be the problem?
JENNA
Listen to me...  I've just travelled six thousand miles to see the corpse of my first born son and I haven't slept for thirty hours and he says I can't go to my room.
The Manager just stares at her but is clearly taken back by her force... 
MANAGER
I'm sorry madam... 
JENNA
How much?
MANAGER
...  it simply isn't possible.
Jenna pulls out a massive bundle of notes. Peels off a couple of hundred dollar bills.
JENNA
... Fuck off you cunt, just hand me the fucking key... 
She lays the money on the desk. The manager looks around... 
MANAGER
Well I might be able to arrange
something... 
The Manager turns to the Concierge.
JENNA
Don't leave the money there. Some cunt'll nick it. Put it in your pocket.
The Manager hesitates.
JENNA (CONT'D)
Put it in your pocket.
MANAGER
There's really no need--
JENNA
Put it in your fucking pocket.
The Manager takes the money. Pockets it. Places the key on the desk.
MANAGER
Room 300.
CUT TO:
INT. FOUR SEASON'S HOTEL / CORRIDOR - DAY
The lift doors open and Jenna walks out, the Porter struggling to keep up with her as she swishes down the corridor.
CUT TO:
INT. FOUR SEASON'S HOTEL / ROOM 300 - DAY
The struggling Porter opens the door and lets Jenna in. She walks into the suite and gives it the once over.
Satisfactory.
The Porter places her bags on the side and hangs up some of her clothes, desperate to try and get out in one piece...  As soon as he's finished he bows and starts to shuffle out of the room.
JENNA
Hey...  Open this.
Jenna points to the Duty Free bag then starts running a bath, beginning to undress.
JENNA (CONT'D)
I need a drink.
The Porter is stunned.
JENNA (CONT'D)
Well don't just stand there... 
The Porter fumbles, taking the gin out of the Duty Free bag, spilling the tonic in his nervousness as he makes her cocktail.
Jenna returns in a dressing gown, takes the drink off him and takes a huge slug.
The Porter is terrified, stunned. Rooted to the spot.
Jenna sits on the bed and stares out of the window. Just as the Porter thinks it's safe to try edging out of the room again, she starts talking to him... 
JENNA (CONT'D)	Billy
I loved him so much you know... 	... 
Beat. The Porter doesn't know what the fuck she's talking about.
JENNA (CONT'D)
Everyone loves their children don't they? Well, not everyone, but... 
She looks over at him. The Porter smiles at her.
JENNA (CONT'D)
Do you want to see a picture?
The Porter nods, uncertain. Jenna gets up, goes over to her purse.
Opens it up. A picture of Billy.
She hands it to the Porter - who takes it and just looks at it, not knowing what to do... 
Jenna starts to cry. For a long time. Finally... 
PORTER
Madam. I have to return to my station.
Jenna snaps out of it in an instant.
JENNA
What, yeah, thanks.
She pulls a fifty dollar bill out of her purse. She hands the money to the Porter who leaves as quickly as he dares.
CUT TO:
BLACK. We hear Dave Berry singing 'Mama'.
FADE IN:
INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - NIGHTMARE
The elevator doors open. Julian steps out into the empty hallway.
Everything is normal...  But everything is also not normal.
The CAMERA tracks from behind as Julian walks - looking at the doors as he passes them and finally stopping in front of one:
He knocks but there is no answer. Realizing the door isn't locked, he pushes it open and steps in.
CUT TO:
INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHTMARE
The room is exactly the same as the one Jenna's staying in. However, instead of her, Julian sees a man sitting on the bed, his back to him. His features are obscured... 
Julian slowly begins to walk towards him, but before he can reach out, the figure turns to face him... 
It's Chang. But there is blood smeared all over his face... 
Julian stares at him in horror. Slowly he looks down at his hands only to discover that they're dripping in blood... 
We ZOOM IN on his hands.
CUT TO:
INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
Julian wakes from his nightmare - covered in sweat. He is alone.
He sits up. Looks at his hands, still very shaken by his nightmare... 
We hear the traffic of Bangkok. Julian gets up and walks to the table...  Light up and begins to smoke morphine...  He walks to the window and looks out over Bangkok... 
His phone rings - Julian answers... 
JULIAN
(ON THE PHONE)
Hello?
JENNA (V.O.)
It's me... 
JULIAN
(ON THE PHONE)
Hi Mum. Where are you?
JENNA (V.O.)
I'm in Bangkok... 
JULIAN
(ON THE PHONE)
What?
Julian looks at his watch.
JULIAN (CONT'D)
(ON THE PHONE)
...  I thought you didn't get in til midnight... ?
Beat.
JENNA (V.O.)
I needed to be by myself... 
JULIAN
(ON THE PHONE)
Okay...  so, what d'you want to do?
JENNA (V.O.)
Raise Hell... 
Julian turns his back to the window.
CUT TO:
INT. FOUR SEASON'S HOTEL / BAR
Jenna looks immaculate. She stubs out her cigarette when she spots
Julian making his way towards her. She gets up and they embrace.
She holds on to him. A little too long.
Finally she pulls away. She looks at him for a long time.
JENNA
Could it be have been one of the gangs?
JULIAN
Maybe. Take your pick. Billy wasn't popular.
JENNA
What do you mean?
JULIAN
You know Billy...  He was eccentric.
Jenna smiles to herself as if this brings back memories and Julian even smiles. Both sit in silence for a moment.
JENNA
But you're going to find out who did it, right?
JULIAN
I'll make sure it gets done.
JENNA
No, it needs to be you that does it. We need to show them. Do you understand what I'm saying?
JULIAN
Yeah, okay, I'll do it.
JENNA
Good.
HOLD ON Julian as we bring up the SOUND of Johnny Cash's Ring of Fire.
VOICE
Love is a burning thing
And it makes a firey ring
Bound by wild desire
I fell into a ring of fire
CUT TO:
INT. KARAOKE BAR - NIGHT
Chang is singing again... 
CHANG
I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down
And the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns
The Ring of Fire / The Ring of Fire
And the cops are all there, Daeng included, watching him... 
CUT TO:
INT. THAI BOXING CLUB - NIGHT
Chang's singing continues as we see an assortment of tough looking Thai Men listening to Gordon (MUTE).
CHANG` (V.O.)
I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down
And the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns
The Ring of Fire / The Ring of Fire
Gordon explains the situation: what information they're after, how much they'll get paid for good leads.
All the while Julian watches from the background.
CUT TO:
EXT. BANGKOK STREETS - NIGHT
A montage of Julian's crew spreading out, shaking down their various contacts: doormen, pimps, dirty cops, stall holders, barmen... 
CHANG (V.O.)
The taste of love is sweet
When hearts like ours meet
I fell for you like a child
Oh, but the fire went wild.
One of the crew, the rat faced Charlie Ling, starts talking to the Hotel Owner who was there the night of the murder. A couple of hundred Bhat notes and he starts talking... 
CUT TO:
INT. KARAOKE BAR - NIGHT
Chang reaches the climax of the song.
CHANG
I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down
And the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns
The Ring of Fire / The Ring of Fire
The Cops watch with total devotion.
CUT TO:
EXT. SLUMS - DAY
A Tuck-tuck makes its way through the crowded streets driven by one of Choi Yan Lee's Three Daughter's.
In the back sits Choi Yan Lee, his stump of an arm in a sling, a daughter either side of him.
His arm's only just been bandaged up and he's clearly still in a lot of pain, his face going into spasm with every bump in the road.
CUT TO:
EXT. CHOI YAN LEE'S KIOSK - DAY
Julian stands on the street corner sipping a soft drink. Waiting.
Behind him Gordon, his phone glued to his face.
On the other side of the road is Choi Yan Lee's Kiosk, big enough to double as his home, currently manned by his long suffering wife Kim Yan Lee. She serves a chilled coconut to a man. As he turns round we reveal...  he's a particularly murderous looking member of Julian's crew - Ko Sam.
We pick out Charlie Ling a little further down the road, who's looking at a tray of battery powered robots that some Street Kid's selling.
They're all counting down the minutes. Biding their time. Waiting for Choi Yan Lee to turn up.
Finally the sound of the Tuck-tuck approaching... 
Ko Sam drinks his coconut down in one - slurping as he hits the bottom. Letting the empty shell fall to the floor.
Charlie Ling stands up. Feels the gun under his jacket.
The Tuck-tuck pulls up and Choi Yan Lee's Daughters help him into the kiosk that doubles as their home.
Julian and his men close in.
CUT TO:
INT. CHOI YAN LEE'S SHACK
As Choi Yan Lee enters his home and his daughters make a fuss of him, the shutters of the kiosk counter are suddenly SLAMMED SHUT.
They all turn round in panic, but before they can do anything about it, the last of the three daughters is pushed into the kiosk, followed by Ko Sam, Charlie Ling, Gordon and Julian.
Choi Yan Lee snivels in the corner, waving his bandaged arm in the air.
CHOI YAN LEE
(IN THAI)
You can't kill me. I'm a cripple.
KIM YAN LEE
(IN THAI)
Who are you? What do you think you're doing? Get out or we'll call the police.
Ko Sam shakes his head at her. Not a good idea. Julian turns to Charlie Ling.
JULIAN
Ask him if he's Choi Yan Lee.
At the mention of his name the colour drains from Choi Yan Lee's face. His eyes lock with Julian's.
CHARLIE LING
(IN THAI)
Is your name Choi Yan Lee?
Choi Yan Lee nods his head.
JULIAN
Ask him why he killed my brother.
CHARLIE LING
(IN THAI)
You killed his brother. Big mistake fat man. Why'd you do it?
Beat. Choi Yan Lee knows he's been caught... 
CHOI YAN LEE
(IN THAI)
He murdered my daughter.
CHARLIE LING
He says he killed his daughter.
Julian considers him for a moment. Slowly he pulls out a gun... 
Aims it at Choi Yan Lee's face... 
CHOI YAN LEE
(IN THAI)
Oh God. Please don't kill me. Please. I'll give you anything. Anything you want. My daughters. My shop. Please. I've paid for what I did. Look at me.
In his desperation Choi Yan Lee suddenly lurches forward, brandishing his wounded arm at Julian. He pulls the bandages off, exposing the bloody stump.
CHOI YAN LEE (CONT'D)
(IN THAI)
I've paid for what I did. Don't you see?
Julian turns to Charlie Ling.
JULIAN
What's he saying?
Beat.
CHARLIE LING
He says...  He says he's paid for what he's done. That he's been punished already.
Choi Yan Lee nods his head enthusiastically.
CHOI YAN LEE
(IN THAI)
He told me to do it. Then he took my hand. Look.
Again he thrusts his stump at Julian who glances at him.
JULIAN
Who did that to him?
Choi Yan Lee looks at the various faces that surround him - then stares directly at Julian.
CHOI YAN LEE
(IN THAI)
The Angel of Vengeance... 
Charlie Ling looks at him surprised...  yet there's a sense that deep down he knows what he's talking about... 
CHARLIE LING
(IN THAI)
It's a lie - he doesn't exist... 
CHOI YAN LEE
(IN THAI)
I'm telling the truth. It was the Angel of Vengeance.
JULIAN
What's he saying?
CHARLIE LING
He's lying... 
JULIAN
Tell me.
CHARLIE LING
It's a story old women tell their grand children...  'The Angel of Vengeance' is supposed to come down from the heavens and judge the living...  restore karma to the world..
Gordon laughs...  but Julian listens with great interest... 
JULIAN
How does he do that?
CHARLIE LING
Leads people to their destiny... 
That's the myth anyway.
Ko Sam smiles. Julian doesn't. Finally:
JULIAN
Ask him who cut his hand off.
Charlie Ling's reluctant to question him further. Julian insists.
JULIAN (CONT'D)
Do it.
CHARLIE LING
(IN THAI)
Who turned you into a cripple - and no bullshit this time.
Choi Yan Lee continues babbling hysterically... 
CHOI YAN LEE
(IN THAI, QUIETLY)
I'm telling you the truth...  The Angel of Vengeance is real...  He made me do it...  You've got to believe me...  I've already been judged.
CHARLIE LING
He says it was The Angel of Vengeance... 
Choi Yan Lee starts to giggle uncontrollably.
CHOI YAN LEE
(IN THAI)
The Angel of Vengeance. Yes. You don't find the Angel of Vengeance. No. He finds you.
JULIAN
What's he saying?
CHARLIE LING
(IN THAI)
Pull yourself together fat man. If you don't talk sense I'll cut off your cock and shove it down your throat.
CHOI YAN LEE
(IN THAI)
I'm telling you the truth. He'll find you.
Choi Yan Lee retreats to the corner of the room.
JULIAN
What did he say?
Charlie Ling considers Choi Yan Lee. Realizes he's not going to get a better answer out of him... 
CHARLIE LING
He said you don't find The Angel of
Vengeance. He finds you... 
Julian considers this for a long time. He realises he's not pointing his gun anymore. Puts it away.
GORDON
Are we going to kill him or what?
The room suddenly feels stuffy. The atmosphere oppressive.
Julian's got to get out... 
GORDON (CONT'D)
What are you doing?
But Julian's already stumbling out of the kiosk... 
JULIAN
Nothing...  We're not going to do anything...  Just leave him. Leave them all.
