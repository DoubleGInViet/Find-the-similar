EXT. KIOSK - DAY
Julian stumbles out of the kiosk and breaths in lungfulls of air.
Disoriented, he careers into a stall selling various religious artefacts, sending candles, incense and statues of Buddha flying... 
He falls to the ground. When he gets to his feet everything around him seems intense and incredibly vibrant...  The dogs fighting on the street, the Buddha that lies in pieces on the ground, the children that stand watching him, his crew as they come out of the kiosk, hiding their guns... 
Julian takes a long moment to get his bearings...  Finally he stands up, but as he does he feels different...  As if the axis of his world has shifted... 
CUT TO:
INT. THAI BOXING CLUB - NIGHT
The CAMERA TRACKS from the side as we see Jenna walk through the boxing gym. All around her people are fighting and sparring.
She spots Julian and Gordon through the large windows of the office.
They see her and stand up.
We LINGER OUTSIDE in the training area as Jenna goes through THE DOOR... 
CUT TO:
INT. BACK ROOM - NIGHT
Boxers train in the background. Jenna, Julian and Gordon sit in silence. Finally:
JENNA
Did you kill him?
Beat. A shared look between Gordon and Julian.
JULIAN
It's a little bit more complicated than that Mum.
JENNA
Complicated? He killed my son...  What's so fucking complicated about that?
JULIAN
Mum, calm down... 
JENNA
Don't tell me to calm down. I want him dead.
Beat...  Julian does not know how to explain the situation. Jenna stares at him.
JENNA (CONT'D)
We don't forgive. Only God does.
JULIAN
I know, you always say that - but this is different... 
JENNA
How?
Silence. Julian doesn't know how to answer. Jenna watches him carefully... 
JULIAN
Maybe...  Maybe Billy had it coming... 
JENNA
What are you talking about?
JULIAN
... because of what he did.
Jenna thinks it over for a moment.
JENNA
I don't care.
JULIAN
Why?
JENNA
Just don't - some Thai cunt murdered your brother and we're not going to let him get away with it.
JULIAN
What if...  What if it was The Angel of
Vengeance?
Jenna stares at her son like he's finally lost the plot.
JENNA
The Angel of fucking what... ?
JULIAN
... it - or he - restores karma and order in the world.
JENNA
'Restores' things? Who said anything about 'restoring' things?
Beat.
JULIAN
He loves all humans... 
JENNA
I don't know what kind of spiritual journey you're on, but you will kill him--
JULIAN
I'm not, I'm just... 
Julian can't get the words out. He gets up.
JULIAN (CONT'D)
...  I've got to go.
... and Julian leaves - letting the door to the office stay open. We pick up the sounds of the fighters training outside as we slowly ZOOM IN on Jenna. She turns to Gordon.
JENNA
How's business?
GORDON
It's alright, yeah. Well, what with Billy not being around, it's tricky to be honest... 
JENNA
What d'you mean?
GORDON
Well, we're supposed to be moving five keys out the end of this week. But Billy's not here, is he?
JENNA
I'm here. Julian's here.
Gordon shrugs. Jenna clocks it.
JENNA (CONT'D)
What's gotten into him... ? Is he high or something?
GORDON
I don't know. Earlier today - we had the guy...  The guy that killed Billy. Had a gun against his face. But then - nothing... 
JENNA
Nothing?
GORDON
Julian let him go. Now there's all this stuff about angels ...  I don't know what the fuck's wrong with him.
JENNA
Not like you... 
Gordon smiles at her uncertainly.
GORDON
I know how to do what needs to be done.
That's all.
She stares at him, long enough to make him uncomfortable.
JENNA
So tell me...  What did he mean when he said it was complicated?
GORDON
There's this other guy...  Might have been involved... 
JENNA
So we kill them both.
GORDON
We don't know who the other guy is yet... 
JENNA
Okay. Well how about we start with the guy we do know?
CUT TO:
INT. KARAOKE BAR - NIGHT
A girl sings 'Another Woman's Man' by Dolly Parton.
Julian's sitting alone at a table, nursing a drink.
Mai enters, looking much more sophisticated than when we saw her in the hotel. She sits next to Julian and gives him a kiss on the cheek.
MAI
Sorry I'm late.
JULIAN
It's alright... 
He drinks his drink. Silence... 
MAI
What's wrong?
JULIAN
Nothing.
Mai looks around the bar...  It's half empty - some girls and men spread out.
The waitress comes over and Mai orders a drink. They sit in silence, listening to the song... 
MAI
See anyone you want us to take home tonight?
Julian glances round but shakes his head. Looks at Mai.
MAI (CONT'D)
What?
JULIAN
Nothing... 
MAI
What's with you? You want to get high?
Beat. Silence. Finally... 
JULIAN
I want you to meet my Mum.
A pause, Mai slightly taken about.
MAI
Is she here?
Julian nods.
MAI (CONT'D)
D'you want me to?
Julian nods. Mai studies him.
MAI (CONT'D)
Why d'you want me to meet her?
JULIAN
To show her...  To show that I've got something here... 
MAI
What, like we're a couple?
Julian stares at her for a long time. Can't quite say it out loud, but the answer's yes.
CUT TO:
EXT. CHOI YAN LEE'S SHACK - NIGHT
Choi Yan Lee oversees his daughter's serving hot food to customers.
FOCUS ON Liang, the young kick boxer, watching him from across the street. Liang pulls out a knife which glints in the light of the street lamps. He heads over to the shack.
Liang asks Choi Yan Lee a question. Choi Yan Lee leans over to hear him better. Liang GRABS hold of his hair and PULLS him over the counter, SLITTING his throat with the knife.
Choi Yan Lee's wife and daughters look on as blood floods from his neck, over the sweets and snacks on sale and down to the ground below.
Life slips away from Choi Yan Lee in a matter of seconds. Liang holds onto him until he's dead and then lets go of his head and runs off into the night.
CUT TO:
EXT. BANGKOK STREET - NIGHT
Gordon is waiting on a street corner smoking cigarettes. Liang comes up to him, breathless.
Gordon pulls out several hundred dollars.
GORDON
Never come back - you understand me?
Liang nods.
GORDON (CONT'D)
Good... 
Liang takes the money. A proper pay out.
GORDON (CONT'D)
You're a fighter, kid. No doubt about it. Good luck with that.
CUT TO:
INT. BACK ROOM - DAY
Julian's talking to Liang's Mother and Sister who are sitting
in front of him, both upset. Gordon hovers in the background... 
JULIAN
When did you last see him?
LIANG'S SISTER
Last night. He went out.
JULIAN
Did he have any enemies?
LIANG'S SISTER
None.
LIANG'S MOTHER
(IN THAI)
Someone called him.
LIANG'S SISTER
Someone called his mobile.
JULIAN
Who?
LIANG'S SISTER
She doesn't know. They spoke in
English.
Liang's Mother pulls out a mobile phone. Passes it to Julian.
JULIAN
This his phone?
Liang's Sister nods. Julian scrolls through the numbers. All have Thai names against them - except one. Julian considers the number, then redials.
A beat. Then the SOUND of a phone ringing in the same room.
Gordon looks round. Realises he's busted. Takes his phone out.
Kills it.
Julian stares at him. Before he gets a chance to say anything, there is a knock on the door.
JULIAN (CONT'D)
What is it?
THAI MAN (V.O.)
There's some cops here to see you.
JUILAN
What do they want?
THAI MAN (V.O.)
Probably just money. You want me to find out how much?
Julian thinks it over... 
JULIAN
No, I'll talk to them.
CUT TO:
INT. BOXING CLUB - DAY
Julian clocks the cops who are waiting for him. He walks over,
strangely on edge. As he gets closer he sees Chang - standing
on the other side of the room by the boxing ring, his back to
him, watching the sparring fighters...  Julian stares at him... 
Turns back to the cops... 
JULIAN
Good morning officers. How can I help you?
Slowly Chang turns to face him. Julian stares at him as if he's in a trance... 
KIM
We're investigating the murder of Choi
Yan Lee.
Julian recovers. Turns to Kim and shrugs.
JULIAN
Never heard of him.
KIM
His arm was cut off. Here.
Julian manages to cover his reaction.
JULIAN
I run a boxing club. Not much call for one armed men.
A beat. Mexican stand off.
JULIAN (CONT'D)
What's this got to do with me?
KIM
He was the father of the girl that was found dead with your brother.
JULIAN
Then I guess you boys have got a lot of work to do - so have I, so if you'll excuse me... 
KIM
That's why we're here Mr Hopkins. If you could just answer our questions.
JULIAN
Sure, sorry. What do you want to know?
Julian looks over to Chang who continues staring at the boxers.
The way the ring is lit he's almost silhouetted.
KIM
Where were you last night?
JULIAN
With my mum... 
Some of the boxers come over to Chang. They know him. They're reverential. With the effect of the lighting, it seems to Julian like they're bowing down before a God.
JULIAN (CONT'D)
You want to speak to her?
KIM
That wont be necessary at the moment.
JULIAN
Am I suspect?
Chang turns round to face Julian. His presence is magnetic. Julian stares back at him, realizing that this must be the Angel of Vengeance...  Chang walks over to them. Studies Julian for a long moment and then turns to Kim.
CHANG
(IN THAI)
This is not the man.
And as soon as he's said it, he turns on his heel and leaves.
The cops back off and away.
ZOOM IN on Julian. Deflated and strangely disappointed...  He turns to Gordon who's standing behind him.
JULIAN
I want you to find out who that guy is.
Okay?
GORDON
Sure. No problem.
JULIAN
Now.
The SOUND of Nadee singing 'LONELY COMING DOWN' by Dolly Parton.
CUT TO:
INT. KARAOKE BAR
Chang sits on his own drinking apple juice as he watches his wife sing on stage. Julian enters, sees Chang but can only see the back of his face. He walks over to the bar, orders a drink.
Julian starts to watch Nadee. When he turns back to the bar he sees Chang reflected in the optics - somehow standing right next to him, staring at him. Julian turns to face him.
CHANG
Why are you here?
JULIAN
You're him...  Aren't you?
CHANG
Who?
JULIAN
The one who killed my brother.
Chang says nothing for a long time.
CHANG
I love all living things.
Beat.
CHANG (CONT'D)
I restore karma. Is that why you came?
JULIAN
I came here to kill you.
CHANG
What's stopping you?
JULIAN
I don't know... 
CHANG
Would you like me to tell you?
Julian nods.
CHANG (CONT'D)
You want the Angel of Vengeance.
JULIAN
Yes.
CHANG
Why?
JULIAN
Cause, all my life...  I don't know.
CHANG
Yes you do.
JULIAN
My mother wants me to kill you.
Chang stares back at him.
CHANG
And what do you want?
JULIAN
...  I love violence.
CHANG
You want to fight me?
Julian nods.
JULIAN
Thai style.
CUT TO:
INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
Three cops sit eating noodles.
KIM
(IN THAI)
What about his brain?
PHAIBUN
(IN THAI)
It's a risk...  One hit in the wrong place and he'll be straight back in hospital. And maybe he wont be so lucky as last time.
DAENG
(IN THAI)
Then why's he going to fight the
Westerner?
The question hangs in the air. It's what they're all wondering.
PHAIBUN
He used to be a great boxer.
KIM
He has to do it. Since he came out of the coma, that's what he's done. Whatever's been asked of him, he's done it. He can't help it. It's all a mystery... 
A mutual pause.
DAENG
And if he loses?
PHAIBUN
He can't lose. He's the Angel of
Vengeance.
CUT TO:
EXT. CHANG'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Nadee is standing behind Chang. They're playing a game in which they speak in English.
She points out the window.
CHANG
View.
NADEE
Window.
`She points at the table.
CHANG
Table.
NADEE
Do you like the table?
CHANG
Yes. I like the table.
Chang stiffens. Nadee detects the change in him.
NADEE
What is it?
Chang takes her in his arms. He starts kissing her neck.
CHANG
I need to speak to you in Thai.
A pause.
NADEE
(IN THAI)
What is it?
CHANG
(IN THAI)
I love you.
She stares at him for a long moment. It's odd for him to have confessed his feelings in such a way. Not bad, just odd. And then she starts to kiss him back... 
CUT TO:
EXT. STREET - EVENING
Julian is anxiously waiting outside. He looks up as Mai comes out of her appartment in a red dress.
Julian's face drops.
MAI
What is it?
JULIAN
You can't wear that.
MAI
Why not?
JULIAN
My mother's...  Very particular about colours.
MAI
You're kidding?
JULIAN
She hates red. Come on, we'll get you something else.
Mai stares at him, reluctant to give in.
JULIAN (CONT'D)
Come on.
MAI
This is insane.
JULIAN
Look, I'm telling you. It's easier this way. Trust me.
Mai gives in. Takes his hand.
CUT TO:
INT. CLOTHES SHOP - NIGHT
Chang picks out a dress for Mai. She takes it, finding it hard to believe that he's making her do this... 
CUT TO:
INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
Three people sit around a table awkwardly. Julian, Jenna and Mai (dressed very conservatively) all eating soup. A long silence.
JENNA
So...  May, isn't it?
JULIAN
It's Mai, Mum.
JENNA
How long have you two known each other then?
Mai's about to answer but Juilan gets there first.
JULIAN
A year and a half isn't it?
Beat as Mai quickly counts in her head... 
MAI
... that sounds about right.
JENNA
Well it's always a rare treat to meet one of Julian's lady friends.
JULIAN
Mum, please... 
JENNA
So, where did you two meet?
JULIAN
I saw her walking down the street.
Jenna raises an eyebrow... 
JULIAN (CONT'D)
And I thought - this is the most beautiful girl I've ever seen - so I just walked up to her and started talking.
JENNA
I hear that happens a lot in this part of the world...  Tell me, what's your line of work, Mai?
MAI
I work in the service industry.
JENNA
I bet you do. But tell me Mai, before you started serving my son, how many cocks were you serving? Was it over a thousand?
Mai stares at Jenna in disbelief.
JENNA (CONT'D)
I know girls like you. Just because you might be pulling the wool over my son's
eyes don't think it's going to work with me.
JULIAN
Mum, stop it, for fuck's sake.
JENNA
I'm sorry Julian, but I won't stand by and let a dirty little hooker take advantage of my son in the vain hope that her womb isn't so diseased that she can trick him into impregnating her and putting another cocksucking child on to this earth.
JULIAN
Leave her alone Mum. You've got her wrong. She's a good girl.
JENNA
What do you know about what's good?
Beat. Julian says nothing.
MAI
He's good to me... 
JENNA
Well that's nice isn't it, I'm really happy for you--
JULIAN
Mum!
A pause.
JULIAN (CONT'D)
The cops came by my club today.
Beat. She stares at him.
JULIAN (CONT'D)
They're investigating a murder. The guy that killed Billy turned up dead this morning.
Jenna looks bored. Lights a cigarette.
JENNA
Oh really, shame that, still, live by the sword, die by the sword... 
JULIAN
I know it was you, Mum.
JENNA
I did what had to be done.
JULIAN
He was there. He was with them.
JENNA
Who?
JULIAN
The Angel of Vengeance.
JENNA
D'you kill him?
JULIAN
No.
JENNA
Cause he as good as killed Billy. What I want to know is, what are you going to do about it?
JULIAN
I'm not going to kill him... 
JENNA
Yes you are. You're going to do it for me and you're going to do it for your brother.
JULIAN
This isn't about Billy. This is about me. All my life I've been running... 
JENNA
That's right you cunt, cause you always run away whenever there's a problem... 
just like you're running away from killing this fucking Angel of whatever -
JULIAN
- his name is Chang-
JENNA
Chang?!
Mai stands up.
MAI
I should be going now.
JENNA
Sit down you cunt.
JULIAN
Mum, don't talk to her like that.
Mai sits down.
JENNA
So what am I left with?
Julian stares at her.
JULIAN
Me.
Jenna calms down. She looks at their reflections in the mirror behind the bar. We ZOOM in on the mirror, their faces refracted by the glass.
JENNA
You're right. We're family. We stick together. But Billy was family too.
JULIAN
Billy was a fuck up...  He deserved everything he got. You know it and I know it.
JENNA
That's it. I'm not listening to this. I don't ever want to hear you mention his name again...  Do you hear me?
JULIAN
Yeah we were brothers, but we were never close...  And he was only in Bangkok cause you couldn't control him. So you sent him to me--
JULIAN (CONT'D)
--	So you sent him to me and what could I do?
JENNA
You could have protected him.
JULIAN
I did what I could. And that's more than you ever did.
JENNA
I would've done anything for him. Okay, he wasn't born with as many advantages as you were. He struggled with things. But I always stood by him.
JULIAN
And what did that get him? I'll tell you what, a one way ticket to this fucking place, just like me.
JENNA
Don't you dare blame me for what
happened back then.
JULIAN
I'm only here 'cause of you. If you didn't exist, I wouldn't be here.
Beat.
JULIAN (CONT'D)
I could've been someone, Mum. I was on my way... 
Jenna stares at him - this is a conversation she does not like having... 
JENNA
You would've been a great fighter... 
You could've gone pro.
JULIAN
Don't you think I know that? And look at me now. I'm a front for a drugs smuggling.
He turns to Mai.
JULIAN (CONT'D)
It's true...  The whole thing's a front. Every day I see kids coming in with great potential. And every day I see kilos of heroin going out. And it's all because of you, Ma. You and the money and the drugs.
Jenna silently seethes, waiting for Julian to shut the fuck up.
He quietens down... 
JENNA
At least you're not behind bars and that's more important to me.
Julian turns to her - he has been waiting all his life to say this.
JULIAN
That's right Mum. That's what's more important to you. But what about me? Sometimes I think you only got me out of there so the cops couldn't trace it back to you... 
Jenna stares at him. Her face a mask.
JULIAN (CONT'D)
... that's right Mum. Think about it. With me gone you were safe. And it turned out to be good for business as well. All very convenient.
Silence between them. Jenna lights another cigarette - her hands now shaking.
JULIAN (CONT'D)
Is that what happened with Billy? Did Billy become a problem like I did? Wouldn't surprise me, he was a big fucking problem when he was here... 
Still, at least you didn't have him killed.
Jenna slaps him hard on the face. Julian recovers. Looks up at her. Very intense.
JULIAN (CONT'D)
I'm not going to kill him for you, Mum. Doesn't matter what you say. And do you want to know why?
JENNA
Surprise me.
JULIAN
'Cause I'm going to fight him. In the ring. Me versus him.
JENNA
Well that seems sensible ...  And what do you hope that's going to achieve?
JULIAN
I don't expect you to understand. Cause you don't understand anything that isn't about you.
JENNA
And when you lose, what's going to happen then?
JULIAN
I don't know...  But maybe this time I'll win. Like you say, only God forgives. Maybe this time he'll forgive me... 
Jenna turns to Mai.
JENNA
Do you understand what he's talking about? 'Cause I haven't got a fucking a clue.
JULIAN
You never did, Mum.
A pause. Julian's touched a nerve. Jenna recovers.
JENNA
I hope you find what you're looking for. 'Cause if you don't, it's going to find you and I'm not always going to be there to look after you.
Jenna composes herself. Suddenly brightens. A different person.
JENNA (CONT'D)
Nice to meet you Mai. Hope to see you again soon.
Jenna shakes her hand. Mai's too shocked to resist. And then, as if nothing had happened, Jenna leaves.
Julian covers his face with his napkin.
MAI
Are you alright?
He's not. He's crying. But he doesn't want anyone to see.
JULIAN
I'm fine.
Beat.
JULIAN (CONT'D)
I'll be fine. In a minute.
Julian wipes his face clean. Pulls himself together.
JULIAN (CONT'D)
Sorry about that.
CUT TO:
EXT. FOUR SEASON'S HOTEL - NIGHT
Jenna gets out of her cab and walks toward reception, a look of steely determination in her eyes.
CUT TO:
INT. FOUR SEASON'S HOTEL - NIGHT
The Concierge and the Manager see Jenna coming towards them and brace themselves... 
However, to their relief, she diverts to the palm court area where Gordon is waiting for her.
GORDON
Nice evening?
JENNA
Lovely, yeah. Just catching up, you know.
Jenna sits down. Lights a cigarette.
JENNA (CONT'D)
You're a piece of work, aren't you?
Gordon blushes. Jenna blows out her match.
JENNA (CONT'D)
No fucking hanging about with you, is there?
GORDON
Well, I don't know about that. Just been out here a while...  Know how to get things done.
JENNA
I bet you do.
GORDON
But things are going to shit. Since Billy died, Julian's all over the place... 
JENNA
We'll have to something about that the, wont we? But, first things first, what about Chang?
GORDON
Who?
JENNA
My son's guardian angel.
GORDON
He's just a retired cop... 
JENNA
Good, then he won't be to hard to kill, will he?
GORDON
It's not that simple...  Is there somewhere we can go that's a little more private?
Beat. She raises her eyebrows.
JENNA
What did you have in mind?
Gordon blushes. Moves closer, conspiratorial... 
GORDON
You can't just going round killing cops here anymore. It's not that easy.
JENNA
I didn't say it was easy. But then, you're a resourceful man, aren't you?
GORDON
I looked into it. Chang's a hard man to get to. None of the Thais'll go near him... 
JENNA
Well then you're going to have to find someone who's not a fucking Thai then, aren't you?
GORDON
There might be a way...  But Julian can't find out... 
Jenna looks at Gordon - smiles and crosses her legs.
JENNA
Don't you worry about that. There are certain things that a mother and son shouldn't - and don't - discuss... 
Gordon thinks he does but isn't a hundred per cent sure.
CUT TO:
INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
Julian sits on a chair, holding his hand over a flame. Mai finishes applying make up, comes out of the bathroom wearing her red dress. She watches him for a moment.
MAI
What are you doing?
JULIAN
Seeing when it hurts.
Mai watches him. He doesn't flinch.
MAI
I'm going to go.
Julian takes his hand off the flame. Sees she's left the clothes he bought her behind.
JULIAN
Didn't you like what I got you?
MAI
It's fine, but you know...  It's not my style.
JULIAN
What do you mean?
MAI
Maybe you should give it to your mother.
JULIAN
Don't to be so hard on her. Her life hasn't been easy.
MAI
Come on Julian. She's a fucking bitch.
JULIAN
Don't say that, okay? You don't know what you're talking about. She'd do anything for me.
MAI
The way she talks to you --
JULIAN
Don't go there.
MAI
What? 'Don't talk about my mother'?
Come on Julian.
Julian stands up, angry.
MAI (CONT'D)
Why don't you fuck her instead of me?
Julian grabs hold her neck. Throws her hard against the wall.
JULIAN
You don't get to judge her. You think she's bad? You should've met my dad.
But he's not around anymore, and do you know why? Cause she loved me too much.
He lets go of her neck. Mai rubs her neck.
MAI
You're fucked.
He pulls money out of his pocket.
JULIAN
How much do I owe you?
He forces a roll of notes into her hand, forcing her to take it.
MAI
Fuck you.
She opens the door, sets fire to the money, and walks out of the room.
As she walks down the hotel corridor, Julian slams his fists into the wall.
CUT TO:
INT. SKYLIGHT BAR - NIGHT
A mixed clientele. High class. Asian and European. But there's an edge to the atmosphere. The music's that bit too loud, that bit too aggressive. And the people inside don't look like they're having a good time. It seems evil. Sleazy.
Jenna introduces herself to Yuri Karkov, a well dressed and charismatic Russian in his forties who is surrounded by Thai girls and fellow Russians including his distinctive looking bodyguard, Dimitri.
As the camera TRACKS CLOSER to them we start to hear what they're saying... 
YURI KARKOV
...  so why do you want to kill a policeman? Policemen are good. They mind their own business and keep the streets safe. Stop people stealing my cars... 
JENNA
You really want to know?
YURI KARKOV
Yes. It may effect the price.
JENNA
He killed my son.
YURI KARKOV
Revenge. Pricey... 
JENNA
This is Bangkok. Nothing's that
expensive.
YURI KARKOV
You're right. Most things are cheap in Bangkok. Especially life...  We'll take care of this business for you. But it won't be easy and it won't be cheap.
CUT TO:
INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
Chang and his crew eat dinner together.
CUT TO:
EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
A crappy van pulls up outside. Out get three Cambodian men. Very poor, badly clothed. They look like farmers. Only they pull out semi automatic firearms and head for the restaurant.
CUT TO:
INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
Chang has just finished a meal with the Cops including Kim, Daeng and Phaiban. Chang is just settling the bill when the Three Gunmen walk in. He looks up just as they OPEN FIRE.
An insane storm of led rains down on the room, shattering all the mirrors on the back wall, taking out Two Waitresses and covering the room with broken glass.
Chang hits the floor and starts to drag himself towards some cover.
Chang's men are completely pinned down. Phaiban's been hit and his white shirt has turned dark red with blood.
Chang keeps edging towards where his jacket's hanging on a chair.
In it, his pistol.
The Gunmen keep firing. As soon as a clip is finished, they pull it out and put a fresh one in and keep shooting.
A stray bullet hits the waiter who knocks over the chair Chang's jacket's on. It falls to the ground. With it, his pistol. He grabs it and returns fire, letting off four rounds.
He takes Gunman One. Head shot, right between the eyes. Gunman Two sees this and sprays at Chang -
-	but Chang manages to dive to cover. He rolls and fires again, shooting Gunman Two in the chest three times.
Chang's out of ammo and needs to reload. Gunman Three's weapon jams. He drops his weapon and runs.
Before he's finished reloading his pistol, Chang's after him. He sees Phaiban. Dead. Daeng trying to stem the flow of blood from his chest.
Chang keeps running, determined not to lose his man.
CUT TO:
EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
The driver of the crappy van smokes nervously in the driving seat as he waits. As soon as he sees Gunman Three, panic-stricken, running in fear, he puts the van in gear, revs the engine and starts to pull away.
Gunman Three runs after him, crying out for him to slow down. The Driver slows. Gunman Three struggles to jump into the open doors.
Chang bursts out of the restaurant. Stops dead. Aims and fires off two rounds.
Blood spatters across the inside of the windscreen. The Driver falls forward, dead.
The back door of the van slams shut. Gunman Three thinks he's made it. He's wrong. The van isn't going anywhere.
Chang approaches the back door of the van, ready to fire.
CHANG
(IN THAI)
Do you want to die? Do you want me to kill you? For what you've done?
A long pause. Finally:
GUNMAN THREE (O.S.)
(IN THAI)
No. Please. Don't kill me.
CHANG
(IN THAI)
Tell me why not. Tell me why I shouldn't shoot you as soon as you come out of that door.
GUNMAN THREE (O.S.)
(IN THAI)
I'm sorry?
CHANG
(IN THAI)
Not good enough.
GUNMAN THREE (O.S.)
(IN THAI)
It's my first time. I've never done anything like this before.
CHANG
(IN THAI)
I know that. You're wearing sandals.
Hitmen don't wear sandals.
The door opens. Sandaled feet step out of the van. Gunman Three comes out with his hands up, falling to his knees. Chang continues to point his weapon at the unarmed man.
CHANG (CONT'D)
(IN THAI)
Give me a reason.
The Cops appear behind him in the doorway. Chang holds his ground.
His finger twitches. It looks like he's going to pull the trigger.
GUNMAN THREE
(IN THAI)
I'm begging you. Please--
CHANG
(IN THAI)
You showed no mercy in there. Why should mercy be shown to you?
GUNMAN THREE
(IN THAI)
I don't know... 
CHANG
(IN THAI)
Yes you do.
A long beat.
GUNMAN THREE
(IN THAI)
I don't know his name.
CHANG
(IN THAI)
But you know where he is.
Gunman Three looks up...  Nods.
CUT TO:
INT. COVERED ELECTRICAL MARKET - NIGHT
Flanked by the Cops, Chang frog marches Gunman Three through the crowds, passing various stalls that seem to sell anything you could ever want for your TV, computer or Hi-fi.
Gunman Three is so scared that he keeps forgetting the route and fretting about which way to turn at every junction in the warren-like market.
Finally they reach the entrance to a particular shop.
CUT TO:
INT. ELECTRICAL SHOP - NIGHT
Chang enters, followed by the others. Gunman Three is incredibly relieved to have found it. Li Po stands behind the counter - beside him sits Pan, a twelve year old boy who is severely handicapped.
As soon as Li Po sees Chang and his crew arrive with Gunman Three next to them he knows the game's up. He can't run. His kid's sitting there... 
He approaches them with a heavy sigh.
CHANG
(IN THAI)
You know why we're here.
LI PO
(IN THAI)
Yes... 
GUNMAN THREE
(IN THAI)
He set it up. He knows who ordered the hit. He'll tell you.
CHANG
(IN THAI)
Don't talk unless I ask you to.
Understood?
GUNMAN THREE
(IN THAI)
Yes. Completely understood.
Chang turns to Li Po.
CHANG
(IN THAI)
Do you have anything to say for
yourself?
LI PO
(IN THAI)
I'm a salesman. Some of the things I sell aren't exactly legal...  But I'll give you the man that hired the hit... 
Chang stares at him... 
CHANG
(IN THAI)
Good... 
Li Po summons the contact details on his distinctive looking mobile phone. Proffers it to Chang.
LI PO
(IN THAI)
As for myself, I'm not scared of paying for what I've done. I just...  just don't hurt my son.
Chang looks down at Pan - who is just staring at them, not understanding the situation.
Chang takes the phone from Li Po.
GUNMAN THREE
(IN THAI)
You see? He knows. He's got the details.
I told you he would.
CHANG
(IN THAI)
And I told you not to talk unless I asked you.
Chang aims his gun at Gunman Three.
GUNMAN THREE
(IN THAI)
Wait. You said if I took you to him you'd let me live.
Chang shakes his head.
CHANG
(IN THAI)
I never said that.
Chang fires. Gunman Three's brains spatter across the TV screens on the far side of the wall.
Pan begins to cry and Li Po hugs him and tells him how much he loves him...  thinking they're next... 
Chang studies the mobile phone.
CHANG	(CONT'D)
(IN THAI)
This him?
Li Po nods - scared.
CHANG	(CONT'D)
(IN THAI)	him?
Where do I find
LI PO
(IN THAI)	the Jupiter.. Every
Skylight bar at
night.
Chang studies Li Po making sure he speaks the truth...  then nods.
CHANG
(IN THAI)
I'm taking your phone.
Chang turns to leave.
LI PO
(IN THAI)
What about me?
Beat. Chang considers. Looks at Pan who's staring at Chang in fear. Looks back at Li Po.
CHANG
(IN THAI)
I forgive you... 
CUT TO:
EXT. THE JUPITER - NIGHT
A people carrier pulls up outside the hotel. The doormen open the side door and step back when they see the heavily armed and bloodstained policemen get out, led by Chang.
CUT TO:
INT. SKYLIGHT BAR - NIGHT
PICK OUT Dimitri and the group of Russian Criminals. Yuri Karkov is in the centre of them, a girl on either arm.
Chang leads the Cops into the bar. He fires two shots into the ceiling. That shuts everyone up and gets the Russian Criminals up and ready for a confrontation. Half the bar's emptied by the time Chang reaches Yuri Karkov.
YURI
You better have a fucking good reason for doing this. Don't you know who you're fucking with.
Chang looks at him.
CHANG
(IN THAI)
You live in my country. Can't speak my language...  Too bad the one guy on my team that could speak English got murdered today.
Yuri looks round for help. He can't understand a word.
YURI
Can someone tell me what the fuck this guy's trying to say... 
Chang calls over to the barman.
CHANG
(IN THAI)
Can you turn the music off. It won't be long, I promise.
The music's killed.
CHANG (CONT'D)
(IN THAI)
That's better. Thank you very much... 
Chang pulls out Li Po's distinctive mobile phone.
Dimitri, currently flanking Yuri, turns white.
Chang calls a number. A beat. Then a phone starts ringing in Dimitri's jacket pocket (with a really cheesy ringtone). Dimitri winces. Chang shakes his head.
Yuri pulls a gun. Kim shoots him dead. Chang moves his gun across to Dimitri. Holds his mobile phone up to his ear.
Dimitri answers. Chang speaks through the phone.
CHANG (CONT'D)
(IN ENGLISH)
You're under arrest... 
CUT TO:
INT. SKYLIGHT BAR - LATER
WE TRACK IN on Dimitri as he stares at Chang, a rabbit in the headlights. Chang slowly sits down next to him. Talks to him in English.
CHANG (CONT'D)
I need information.
Phaiban spins a spotlight onto Dimitri.
CHANG (CONT'D)
And you're going to help me.
Suddenly the atmosphere in the emptied club shifts. It's as if Dimitri and Chang are locked into some kind of surreal performance... 
CHANG (CONT'D)
Whether you like it or not.
Dimitri's body starts to shake in fear.
DIMITRI
It was an English woman - she wanted you dead... 
A beat. Not what Chang expected... 
CHANG
Why?
DIMITRI
Said you...  murdered her son... .
CHANG
Who was she?
DIMITRI
I don't know... 
CHANG
How did she know me?
Dimitri shakes his head. He really doesn't know.
DIMITRI
She asked for you by name... 
CHANG
And what's my name?
DIMITRI
Chang--
Chang starts to circle him. Dimitri's terrified. Doesn't know what the fuck he's on about. Suddenly he's grabbed from behind by Phaiban.
