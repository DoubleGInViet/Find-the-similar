Chang smashes a beer bottle and walks up behind Dimitri... 
CHANG
(IN THAI)
I see the way you look at my people.
The way you abuse them with your eyes.
For this, I take your sight.
He pushes the broken bottle into Dimitri's eyes. Gauges them out.
Dimitri screams hysterically - calling out for his mother in Russian... 
CHANG (CONT'D)
(IN THAI)
You live in my country, but you fail to learn our language. You don't even try. For this I take your tongue... 
Phaibun grabs Dimitri's head from behind. Chang presses down on his stomach with his knee and opens his mouth - grabs hold of his tongue and with a blade slowly cuts it off.
... Dimitri's screams become more like the howls of a dying animal... 
Chang looks at him and his men release Dimitri who stumbles around the room like a chicken without a head... 
CHANG (CONT'D)
(IN THAI)
You had opportunities. You could have chosen other paths...  But you wouldn't listen...  For this I give you silence... 
Chang grabs Dimitri and pushes the knife into his ear. First one side, then the other.
SOUND OUT. We can't hear Dimitri's screaming. We can't hear anything at all.
Beat.
MUSIC STARTS. Painful and beautiful, but also tacky...  The opening bars to one of Dolly Parton's classics. Karaoke style.
NADEE (V.O.)
If I should stay, I would only be in your way.
So I'll go, but I know I'll think of you every step of the way.
And Chang with his crew just stare at the tortured Russian as he screams until his lungs are ready to burst.

Gordon is sitting on a chair in Jenna's hotel room, a whiskey in his hand, the Bangkok skyline behind him.
NADEE (V.O.)
Bittersweet memories that is all I'm taking with me.
So, goodbye. Please don't cry,
Jenna walks in from the bedroom wearing her dressing gown and walks over to him - a commanding presence. He makes to get up but she pushes him down and then leans down and kisses him hard on the mouth.
CHANG	(V.O.)
We both know that I'm not what you, you need.
CUT TO:

Nadee and Chang continue singing - a spotlight beaming down on them, singling them out in the shadowy bar.

Jenna and Gordon are still kissing as the guitar solo of the instrumental section kicks in... 
CUT TO:
INT. KARAOKE BAR - NIGHT
As Chang waits for the instrumental section to end, he starts to cry, letting the tears flow without embarrassment. Nadee puts her arm around him to comfort him.
The rest of the crew start crying as well, Daeng in particular.
NADEE
I hope life treats you kind
And I hope you have all you've dreamed of... 
And I wish you, joy and happiness.
CHANG
But above all this, I wish you love.

CHANG / NADEE (V.O.)
You, darling, I love you.
Ooh, I'll always, I'll always love you.
Julian lifts his fists up. The same fighting pose we saw him in at the very beginning. He's ready. Ready as he'll ever be.
CUT TO:
BLACK
FADE IN:
INT. THAI BOXING RING - NIGHT
Two figures kneel on either side of the ring. Julian and Chang.
Both wearing Mongkol. Totally still.
The ceremonial music begins... 
Slowly Julian and Chang start to perform Ram Muay, the ancient, traditional dance which the rules of the game say must be carried out before a fight takes place.
It is both strange and spiritual: Julian and Chang move their arms rhythmically, in time to the music, their hands describing shapes and outlining fighting positions.
As the dance develops, so their positions become more combative; now crouching, now standing, hinting at the kicks and punches that they're about to perform...  but all carried out with an almost beatific precision that is at odds with the violence that is about to follow... 
FADE OUT.
The Music Ends. A moment of stillness, and then slowly we bring up the SOUND of the baying crowd. Chanting. Screaming. Wild excitement. Ready for the fight they've all been waiting for... 
FADE IN:
INT. THAI BOXING RING - NIGHT
The crowd is packed. In one corner: Julian. Charlie Ling beside him along with Ko Sam. He looks focussed. Confident.
In the other corner: Chang. Kim next to him along with a couple of his crew. He looks incredibly calm.
The first bell sounds. Five second warning... 
Chang looks over into the crowd. Kanita with Nadee. Kanita offers him a 'thumbs up'. Chang smiles. Returns it.
Julian looks over. Sees Mai take a seat. She holds his gaze.
The second bell sounds. The first of five rounds. Julian and Chang walk up to the centre of the ring. The Referee stands between them. Brings them together. A quick look down to the Three Judges. Then a look between the two fighters.
Julian eyes Chang. Steely determination in his eyes. Chang looks back at him without emotion.
REFEREE
(IN THAI)
Fight.
Julian and Chang circle each other. Julian moves in to attack first. He throws a straight left first to Chang's face and steps his left foot forward at the same time. Chang bends his right leg, dodging the attack. He then pounces on the upper part of Julian's arm with his right hand and catches his wrist with his left hand. He tries to turn Julian's front wrist up, but Julian's too strong. This is a surprise for Chang. He breaks and steps back.
Julian moves in to attack again, raising both elbows to make an attack on Chang's head. Chang steps forward and pulls an uppercut, connecting hard with Julian's chin. Julian moves back, dazed. Takes a moment to get his bearings back. That hurt.
Chang doesn't take the opportunity to attack. He hangs back. Waiting for Julian to come at him again. This pisses Julian off. He moves forward and throws an offensive kick with his right foot. Chang moves back to dodge the attack and swivels to try and strike with a counter attack. He moves too slow. The right footed attack was a feint. Julian slams his right foot down on the floor and uses it to swivel, unleashing a kick with his left which connects with Chang's jaw and sends him flying back.
Julian uses his forward motion to propel him onwards. He bounds over to the disoriented Chang and hits him with a series of jabs and punches to his upper body and face.
Chang's almost on the ropes. Julian comes in hard with kicks to the shins with his right foot. Chang bends his body to pass under Julian's right foot. Julian misses the target. Chang manages to place his right foot on Julian's left knee-joint which makes him fall down.
Julian's in a vulnerable position, but Chang doesn't move to make the killer blow. He steps back to let him recover. Again this enrages Julian.
He gets up and moves forward towards Chang. He comes in with a high right kick. Again Chang manages to dodge the attack and returns with a right foot to the back of Julian's left knee. Julian swivels, punches air, and gets a trio of punches in his gut. His guard's down. But again no killer punch.
JULIAN
Come on.
Chang retreats. Shrugs at Julian. You come on.
Julian moves towards him, but before he gets a chance to take out his frustrations, the bell goes. End of round one.
Julian stalks back to his corner. He turns to look at Chang, a look of intense anger and frustration.
CUT TO:
INT. THAI BOXING RING - NIGHT
Julian moves towards the middle where Chang is already waiting. Julian waits for Chang this time. Chang is reluctant to attack. A waiting game...  Who will strike first...  Chang wins. Julian moves to kick Chang in the ribs, keeping both his hands down as he moves in. Chang predicts this and prepares to throw his own kick as it comes in. Chang steps back, but again Julian swivels, using his right foot instead to pivot and unleashes a killer strike with his left foot. Chang goes flying backwards.
PICK OUT the look of concern etched on the faces of Nadee and Kanita.
Chang recovers but Julian moves in fast with a series of punches and elbows. Chang's on the ropes now and getting badly beaten. He clings on to Julian to limit the damage.
REFEREE
(IN THAI)
Break.
The two fighters step back from each other. Chang'sface is damaged.
Juilan's about to get stuck into him again when the bell sounds.
End of the second round.
Round three: Julian slamming punches into Chang. Nadee comforting Kanita. Telling her it'll be okay. Chang responding with kicks and elbows. Defensive blocks and counter attacks. Mai willing Julian on. Jenna watching with Gordon... 
End of round: Julian feeling more confident. Again his eyes scan
the crowd. This time he sees what he's looking for: Jenna.
Chang eyeballs Julian from the other corner. Sees him staring into the crowd. Looks over. Tries to see what he's looking at but can't make it out.
POV from Chang as he sees Jenna make her way toward Julian. When she gets to him we see her saying something to Julian about the fight - urging him to hit harder... 
Jenna then walks back to Gordon... 
On Chang. Deep in thought. He gets up early. Walks around the ring. Looking into the crowd.
Jenna sees him. Stares at him. Suddenly nervous.
Everything slows down as Chang clocks her again. The colours of the room change from blue to yellow to red. He's seen her and she knows she's been seen. And he knows. And she knows that he knows... 
The bell goes off. Back to reality. Chang turns round. Too late.
He gets a massive blow to his head. He goes down hard.
The Referee starts counting.
Nadee and Kanita watch on, fearful.
Jenna holds her breath. Hopeful that he might be down and out.
Kim watches on, concerned.
KIM
(IN THAI)
Get up. Please get up.
After a long, terrible pause...  Chang gets up. He looks over into the crowd. Makes eye contact with his wife. It's okay.
She shakes her head. She can't bear it. Tears running down her face.
Back on his feet, Chang suddenly drops his guard. Julian hesitates, confused. Chang leans in close to him. Winks.
CHANG
It wasn't you, was it?
Julian shrugs, puts his guard up.
CHANG (CONT'D)
You're innocent.
JULIAN
What are you talking about?
CHANG
It's not your fault.
Chang raises his arms again. Ready to fight. Julian gets ready to attack but something's changed. The fire's gone out of him. He looks over to his mother, to Mai, Chang's words echoing in his mind.
It's not his fault.
Then Chang comes in with a flurry of punches. Left, right, left, right. Julian just takes them... 
Chang pauses in the onslaught. Julian stays motionless in the middle of the ring.
Chang runs at him, flings his right foot, swivels, pulling out a roundhouse left kick -
- which makes contact with Julian's draw.
SLOW MOTION as Julian's head takes the impact.
He's out cold before he hits the floor.

Jenna watches him in silence from the shadows, steadies her breathing and then slips back out of the room.

Jenna comes out of the changing rooms as Mai approaches. Jenna shakes her head.
JENNA
He doesn't want to see anyone.
Mai is disappointed. Doesn't know what to say.
JENNA (CONT'D)
Just give him time... 
MAI
... tell him I came?
JENNA
Of course.
Jenna hugs Mai close.
JENNA (CONT'D)
We'll get him through this together.
CUT TO:
INT. CHANGING ROOMS - NIGHT
Julian turns when he hears a knock at the door. Says nothing. Jenna enters and closes the door behind her. She stands there for a moment as if considering what to say... 
JENNA
You deserved to win. You should've won--
JULIAN
Give it a break mum. Just...  give it as rest.
He steps into the light. She reaches out to touch him.
JENNA
I'll never get use to seeing you get hurt - even when you win.
JULIAN
Yeah, well I lost.
JENNA
And did it make a difference?
Julian says nothing.
JENNA (CONT'D)
I want to know...  Did it make a
difference?
Slowly he shakes his head.
JULIAN
...  No...  it didn't make a difference...  No difference at all.
JENNA
And how do you feel now?
JULIAN
Nothing. I don't feel anything at all.
JENNA
Don't you see, that's how I felt when
Billy died... 
Julian studies his mother.
JULIAN
What do you want, Mum?
Beat.
JENNA
What d'you think I want? I want it to be like it used to be...  I don't want to lose you... 
Jenna starts crying. Could be real, could be an act - hard to tell she's so good... 
JULIAN
What's wrong Mum?
She shakes her head. Can't say it.
JULIAN (CONT'D)
What's wrong?
JENNA
He knows...  He knows it was me.
JULIAN
Who does?
Beat. Jenna says nothing. Julian thinks...  Cogs turn... 
JULIAN (CONT'D)
Chang?
Jenna nods.
JULIAN (CONT'D)
What did you do, Mum? What did you do?
Jenna makes her hand into a pistol. Pretends to fire it into her skull. She tried to have Chang killed. Julian's speechless.
JENNA
He's going to come after me. And after he's come after me, he's going to come after you.
Julian stares at his mother; fragile, terrified, alone.
JENNA (CONT'D)
I'm scared, Julian.
Julian stares at his mother.
JENNA (CONT'D)
What are we going to do?
Julian begins to realize what he has to do...  and he looks at his hands. Finally... 
JULIAN
We'll be okay - I'll do it, I'll take him out... 
JENNA
Not just him. We've got to take them all out.
Julian stares at her - the power she has over him... 
JENNA (CONT'D)
Kill them all. The final solution.

He opens drawers and closets and studies all the photos of Chang as a boxer and soldier.
... on a wall is a framed article in Thai that Charlie Ling is reading.
JULIAN
What's it say?
Charlie starts reading the article out:
CHARLIE LING
"Boxing Cop Hero Back From Grave". One of Bangkok's finest, blah blah blah, came out of a coma that lasted for an entire year, waking up as if nothing had happened...  Wife was really happy, blah blah blah...  "It's hard to describe" Chang said, "but I do feel different."
Charlie starts to sneer as he reads. Julian is listening intently.

Now it's released, my business in
Bangkok is completed.
KIM
When are you leaving?
JENNA
Tonight.
KIM
And your other son - is he going with you?
JENNA
I've had no real contact with Julian since he ran away.
KIM
You watched him fight.
Jenna looks over to Chang.
JENNA
I watched him lose. And he deserved to. You were the better fighter. My only sadness is that Billy got caught up in what he's doing out here. And paid for it with his life.
Kim and the rest of the crew take this in.
JENNA (CONT'D)
I'll never testify against my own flesh and blood, Officer Chang. But he's a killer.
Chang senses something. Starts to become agitated.
JENNA (CONT'D)
...  It pains me to say it, but my own son is a killer. He killed a cop back in England ten years ago. He's been on the run ever since. I say son...  But he hasn't been a son to me.
Chang stares at the door to the bedroom. Feels the presence of someone the other side of the door.
JENNA (CONT'D)
Not for a long time. Not since he killed that cop back home...  That was ten years ago. He's been running ever since. And he'll never stop until he's caught. Until you catch him.
Chang starts to push the door open... 
Behind him Jenna stands up.
Before Chang fully opens the door, his mobile phone rings. It sounds INCREDIBLY loud. He takes it out and looks at the display with a feeling of dread.
He answers...

NADEE (CONT'D)

And slowly Kanita walks towards her room as Charlie Ling watches her...  Kanita closes the door.
Beat - silence... 
Julian stands up and walks toward Nadee - raises his shotgun and blows her head off.
Blood spatters onto the wall, bits of brain and skull everywhere as her body falls to the ground... 
CUT TO:
EXT. BANGKOK STREETS - DAY
Chang stops in his tracks. It's as if he can feel the shotgun blast in his heart. He knows what's just happened...  He stands
still. He closes his eyes as if he had only to wish to make it all go away...  He opens them again to see... 
The street is completely deserted. Chang stands alone in the middle of a ghost town.
CUT TO:
INT. CHANG'S APARTMENT - DAY
Julian takes off his helmet that's covered in blood, throws it onto the floor and walks toward the front door.
CHARLIE LING

Julian shakes his head.
JULIAN
No way.
CHARLIE LING
She said--
JULIAN
Who said?
Beat.
JULIAN (CONT'D)
My mother?
Charlie Ling nods.
JULIAN (CONT'D)
What kind of a mother says that?
CHARLIE LING
If you've got a problem, talk to her.
JULIAN
No. We're not doing it.
CHARLIE LING
You don't have to. I will.
Charlie Ling kicks open the door. Julian realises he can't let him do it.
And as Charlie Ling sees Kanita...  Julian shoots him in the back.
Charlie Ling slumps to the floor.
Julian approaches the doorway. He looks in. Sees Kanita sitting on her bed. She stares at Julian, Charlie Ling's dead body at his feet. They hold each other's gaze...  and then Julian slowly bows his head and leaves...

Julian stumbles out of the apartment, desperately catching his breath. He ends up leaning on a stall - similar to the one he knocked over outside Choi Yan Lee's kiosk. Candles and incense. Buddha's smiling back at him... 
Julian looks around him and again everything seems intense and incredibly vibrant ...  A group of school children, all of whom are Downs Syndrome, are crossing the road. Smiles plastered across their faces...  Julian stares at them...  Their presence seems to have a calming effect on him, as if they're giving him new energy to do what he's starting to realize he has to do next.

As Julian walks down the corridor he takes the shotgun out - holds it out in front of him as if it were a sacred weapon... 
He reaches the door to his mother's room and pauses.
Julian stares at the door as if it was heaven's gate...  He loads the shotgun with two fresh cartridges.
JULIAN
Only God forgives. And now mother - you will die... 
He rings the bell, raising the shotgun, ready to shoot. The door opens -
- but it's Gordon who opens it, dressed in a bathrobe.
Confused, Julian continues to level the weapon at his head. Gordon backs away into the room.
GORDON
Easy... 
Julian says nothing. Edges into the room. The gun still pointed at Gordon's head.
Julian says nothing. Kicks the door closed with his foot.
JULIAN
Where's is she?
GORDON
She's gone...  Picked up Billy's
body...  She's gone home.
Finally Julian lowers the shotgun.
GORDON (CONT'D)
Didn't she tell you?
Julian sits down.
GORDON (CONT'D)
You alright mate? D'you want
something?
Julian mumbles to himself...  then turns to Gordon. Realisation dawning on him:
JULIAN
I'm so fucked...

Reaching the car, Gordon stands by the driver's door as Julian heads for the passenger's side.
Gordon pauses before unlocking the door. Looks over to Julian, talking across the roof of the car.
GORDON
We're good mates aren't we?
Beat. Julian's instantly suspicious... 
JULIAN
...  Yeah.
GORDON
I'm sorry about this Julian. I wish there was another way... 
Gordon levels a pistol at Julian's head.
JULIAN
What did she say? What did she promise you?
GORDON
Don't make this harder--
GUNSHOT. A bullet RIPS through Julian's shoulder. He falls back on the car behind him setting off a chorus of car alarms.
Gordon starts to walk round to deliver the killer blow.
GORDON (CONT'D)
You've become a liability. You can see that, can't you?
Julian looks at the wound. It's deep but he's not totally incapacitated. He pulls the shotgun out from under his shirt. It clatters to the floor.
GORDON (CONT'D)
And now she wants me to take over. She wants me to be the favoured son. What am I supposed to say?
Julian sinks to his knees, leaning over to pick up the shotgun.
He's got seconds... 
GORDON (CONT'D)
I didn't want it to end like this. First
I fuck your mother. Then I--
Gordon turns the corner - but Julian's in position. Two shots in quick succession. Both barrels fired at Gordon's chest.
The force of the explosion FLINGS Gordon's body against the far wall of the car park. Dead instantly.
Julian pulls himself up and stands there, the smoking shotgun acting as a makeshift crutch. He gazes at Gordon's steaming corpse, appalled by the turn of events... 
CUT TO:
EXT. ALLEYWAY - DAY
Julian falls out into a side street. He's badly wounded but he's going to make it... 
CUT TO:
INT. TOILET - DAY
Julian takes the top off a vodka bottle with his teeth. He pours the spirit over his wound. It stings like hell and Julian screams in agony.
CUT TO:
EXT. BANGKOK STREETS - DUSK
Julian walks out into the night, the neon glow turning the streets
into a modern day Hades... .
Although the wound isn't life threatening, Julian's face is pale from the loss of blood. He looks like a ghost.
He sees two cops chatting on a street corner. They don't see him, they're not even looking for him, but they remind him. Chang. It's just a matter of time... 
Julian keeps walking. Wipes sweat from his face. Looking for a place to hide. A hole in the ground. Anything.
Then suddenly it comes to him. A single idea. A possible way of escape... 
CUT TO:
INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
A series of napkins are rolled and placed in a steadily growing pile.
The work is being carried out by Mai who has a lowly position in a massive and sterile industrial kitchen. Not the sort of life she planed on having... 
A Co-Worker calls out to her... 
CO-WORKER
(IN THAI)
Mai. Some guy's out there asking for you.
Mai finishes the last napkin and places it on the pile. She walks towards the exit, passing her Co-Worker... 
CO-WORKER (CONT'D)
(IN THAI)
Don't forget it's supposed to be my break next.
CUT TO:
INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
Mai comes from round a corner and sees Julian leaning against the wall. She checks that they're alone, knowing instinctively that he's in trouble.
MAI
What happened to you?
Beat. Julian almost smiles.
JULIAN
I've got to get out of Bangkok. Didn't want to leave... 
He winces.
JULIAN (CONT'D)
...  without saying goodbye.
MAI
Who did this to you?
A pause.
JULIAN
My mother...  She made me what I am. And now I've got nothing. And they're after me.
Mai stares at him.
MAI
Come with me... 
Julian looks at her.
MAI (CONT'D)
... to Cambodia - we can hide there... 
You'll be safe there.
Mai and Julian smile at each other. It's sweet. Innocent.
JULIAN
I got about twelve grand at the club... 
Should be enough to get us there. Set
ourselves up. Disappear... 
MAI
Now?
JULIAN
Right now.
Mai looks around - they're alone.
MAI
Wait outside... 
CUT TO:
INT. / EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
Julian watches as Mai comes into the Restaurant from the kitchen and walks over to the bar area... 
Making sure no one's watching, Mai starts to pull money out of the til... 
Julian looks over at the shop front next to him...  A Travel Agency.
Pictures of holidays and beaches. Paradise. It all seems in his grasp.
Mai comes up to him... 
MAI
Let's go.
CUT TO:
INT. TAXI - NIGHT
Mai and Julian are in the Taxi. He puts his arm around her. They're on their way... 
CUT TO:
EXT. THAI BOXING CLUB - NIGHT
The taxi pulls up outside Juilan's club.
CUT TO:
INT. TAXI - NIGHT
Julian gets out of the taxi.
JULIAN
Stay here. If I'm not out in five
minutes...  Go.
Mai nods.
MAI
Five minutes.
Julian nods and slams the door shut. Mai watches Juilan disappear into the building.
CUT TO:
INT. THAI BOXING CLUB - NIGHT
We PAN THROUGH Julian's empty club. It's silent and empty like a tomb... 
We PICK UP Julian as he hurries through towards his office.
CUT TO:
INT. BACK ROOM - NIGHT
Back where we first met him... 
Julian flings open the door to his safe and starts pulling wads of money into a canvas hold all.
He's about to leave when he notices someone standing in the shadows behind him.
Slowly, out of the darkness, a series of figures appear like vampires...  Chang and the Cops. Impossible to say how long they've been standing there... 
Chang and Julian stare at each other... 
CHANG
Let's go.
We TRACK IN to a CLOSE SHOT on Julian. It's almost as if this moment was inevitable.
CUT TO:
EXT. THAI BOXING CLUB - NIGHT
Chang brings Julian out of the club. A police car is waiting outside.
Mai sits in the back seat.
CUT TO:
EXT. BANGKOK - NIGHT
The police car drives through the city streets and onto the freeway heading out of town.
CUT TO:
INT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT
Daeng is driving. Kim sits next to him. Daeng looksinto the rearview mirror to see--
Julian and Mai sitting next to Chang. Mai looks scared...  Julian more accepting of his fate... 
CUT TO:
EXT. BANGKOK - NIGHT
The Police Car heads over the Mega Bridge and continues its way out of town.
CUT TO:
INT. CAR - NIGHT
They all sit in the car in silence.
CUT TO:
EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAWN
The Police Car pulls up.
CUT TO:
EXT. FIELD - NIGHT
Chang leads Juilan across the field. The Cops follow a few steps behind with Mai.
Suddenly, and completely unexpectedly, Chang punches Julian in the gut...  Julian falls to the floor and Chang starts to viciously attack him, punching and kicking him.
Finally Julian, unable to defend himself, is lying on the ground, immobile.
CHANG
(IN THAI)
Get up.
Julian rolls over. Eyes Chang. Slowly he starts to get up onto his knees. They continue, Chang forcing Julian to crawl as they make their way further into the field.
Then Chang stops... 
CHANG (CONT'D)
(IN THAI)
Get up. Now.
Julian struggles to get up to his feet, but before he does, Chang kicks him hard in the chest, sending him back down to the floor.
JULIAN
I'm sorry... 
CHANG
(IN THAI)
Do you have anything to say?
JULIAN
Don't hurt her.
He kicks him in the stomach.
CHANG
(IN THAI)
Do you have anything to say?
JULIAN
I'm sorry... 
Chang kicks him again - like you would kick a dog...  Juilan groans.
Chang squats down next to him.
CHANG
(IN THAI)
What do you expect me to do?
JULIAN
I don't know...  I'm sorry.
Chang gets up and walks on. He stops and turns round.
CHANG
(IN THAI)
Come on.
Julian stumbles to his feet. The party continue. We see that one of the crew is carrying an axe.
CUT TO:
EXT. FIELD / HIGH POINT - DAWN
A couple of wild dogs watch as our group reach a high point.
Chang looks down at Julian who is lying on the ground. The crew stand in the background with Mai.
Chang sits next to Julian.
CHANG
(IN THAI)
When you were born - what's the first thing you remember seeing?
A beat as Julian struggles to understand Chang's question...  Chang stares at him.
CHANG (CONT'D)
(IN THAI)
What do you remember?
Beat.
JULIAN
Dark... 	Darkness.
Chang looks at him in a strange way - like this answer has some meaning for him.
CHANG
(IN THAI)
And do you ever see light?
Julian shakes he's head.
JULIAN
No... 	Never.
Chang considers this answer for a long moment. He gets up and
returns to Mai - stares at her... .
CHANG
(IN THAI)
I am the Angel of Vengeance ...  I restore order and karma. I love all living things... 
Mai just stares at him - too frightened to move.
CHANG (CONT'D)
(IN THAI)
... I want you to walk away from here now...  Do you understand?
Mai nods.
CHANG (CONT'D)
(IN THAI)
Good.
Chang smiles at her.
CHANG (CONT'D)
(IN THAI)
Go with God.
Mai turns and leaves. Chang watches her disappear into the field.
Chang takes the axe off Phaiban and turns back to Julian.
CUT TO:
EXT. FIELD - DAWN
Mai walks through the field, alone.
CUT TO:
EXT. FIELD / HIGH POINT - DAWN
Chang leans down next to Julian and whispers something into Julian's ear - so softly that we cannot hear it. Whatever it says it instantly has an effect on Julian. He visibly relaxes.
He doesn't make a sound as he's held down. A plastic strap is tied around his arm as a tourniquet. His arm is pulled out.
Chang swings the axe and chops off first his left hand and then his right.
Julian grits his teeth throughout. Doesn't scream.
Chang picks up the severed hands and throws them to the wild dogs.
The dogs tear into the meat, fighting over their prize.
CUT TO:
EXT. FIELD - DAWN
Chang and his men walk back towards the car.
MUSIC KICKS IN once again...  the Karaoke version of John Denver's country and western ballad... 
CHANG (V.O.)
Almost heaven, West Virginia
Blue ridge mountains
Shenandoah river -
Life is old there
Older than the trees
Younger than the mountains
Growin' like the breeze.
CUT TO:
EXT. BANGKOK - DAY
We see various scenes of every day life in Bangkok.
CHANG (V.O.)
Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain momma
Take me home, country roads
CUT TO:
EXT. SCHOOL - DAY
We see kids waiting outside the school for their parents to pick them up. Kanita spots Chang, runs towards him and they embrace.
CHANG (V.O.)
All my memories gathered round her
Miners lady, stranger to blue water
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky
Misty taste of moonshine
Teardrops in my eye.
Chang and Kanita disappear into a crowd of policemen.
CUT TO:
INT. KARAOKE BAR - NIGHT
Chang is in his element. Singing like a cowboy.
CHANG
Country roads, take me home
to the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain momma
Take me home, country roads..
The Cops sit and watch him. Their leader...  Their God... 
CUT TO:
INT. HOSPITAL - DAY
Julian is lying in hospital. Bandages covering the terrible wounds where his hands once were.
Mai is sitting beside him. Spoon feeding him food.
CHANG (V.O.)
I hear my voice
In the mornin' hour she calls me The radio reminds me of my home far away And drivin' down the road I get a feelin' That I should have been home yesterday, yesterday
CUT TO:
EXT. HEATHROW AIRPORT - DAY
An aeroplane lands.
CHANG (V.O.)
Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
INT. CUSTOMS - DAY
Jenna is in the process of being strip searched by the authorities.
Zero dignity.
CHANG (V.O.)
West Virginia, mountain momma
Take me home, country roads
As one of the Custom's Officers puts on a rubber glove, Jenna starts to scream out obscenities at them. Mask off, a real monster underneath, flailing around for all to see.
CUT TO:
INT. KARAOKE BAR - NIGHT
Chang keeps singing.
CHANG
Country roads, take me home
to the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain momma
Take me home, country roads
Take me home, country roads
Take me home, country roads
And we end CLOSE on Chang. With the sense that the 'country roads' have kind of taken both of them home... 
CUT TO:
THE END
