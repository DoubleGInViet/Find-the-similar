THE SOUND OF THE WIND -- whistling -- as we --

FADE IN:


EXT. KANSAS PRAIRIE - EARLY EVENING

A gray land under a gray sky -- everything flat, drab, dreary. A ramshackle farmhouse -- a creaky weather vane -- a dirt road stretches to nowhere -- but then we see, up ahead, looming over the horizon: A LARGE LIGHTER-THAN-AIR BALLOON -- below which we find:


EXT. THE BAUM & BARLEY BROS. CIRCUS

Not exactly the Greatest Show On Earth, but still a pretty big deal around here. People have come from far and wide -- their modes of transport and their styles of dress telling us we’re in the very early 1900s.

Townsfolk and farmers stroll the midway... barkers shout their come-ons... a Bearded Lady preens... the crowd oohs and aahs at the Daring Young Men On The Flying Trapeze... then we see, in the Menagerie: elephants and monkeys and a lion and a tiger and a bear (oh my)... then we come to:


EXT./INT. OZ’S EXHIBITION TENT

Where the audience gazes listlessly at the two men up on stage. The fast-talking huckster in the velveteen frock-coat is none other than OSCAR ZOROASTER PHADRIG ISAAC NORMAN HENKLE EMMANUEL AMBROISE DIGGS -- a.k.a. ‘OZ’ for short -- and he’s standing with his back to the second guy, who looks to be some local businessman.

OZ
Now, we don’t know each other, do

we?	We’ve never met, you and I.

FRANK
No, sir, we sure haven’t.

OZ
And your name is --?

FRANK
Frank.
 
2.


OZ
Short for Franklin.

FRANK
That’s right.

OZ
Lucky guess.	Now, Frank, you got
‘em on there good and tight?

Now we see: Oz’s hands are handcuffed behind his back. FRANK gives the cuffs a yank and --

FRANK
They’re tight all right.

OZ
Thank you, Frank -- and might I just say you’re a credit not only to your community but to the great state of Kansas itself -- ad astra per aspera and E Pluribus Unum.
(Frank starts to leave)
But before you go, I was wondering:
Would you happen to know the time?

FRANK
Well, sure, I...

He dips into his vest pocket -- frowns -- starts patting his other pockets and --

OZ
Is this what you’re looking for?

And Oz triumphantly brings his arms out from behind his back. In one hand he’s holding the handcuffs from which he’s just escaped -- in the other he’s dangling Frank’s pocket watch by its chain. Frank takes his watch back, seems wowed -- and Oz turns to the crowd, takes a bow, but --

Not a single person claps -- everyone’s just looking at him about as animated as cows.

OZ
Heh-heh, yes, well -- please, no
need to applaud -- your awestruck
expressions of amazement are
approbation enough.	So, moving
right along... I have in my hand
here a flea.	Can everyone see
that?	You in the back?
(of course they can’t;
there is no flea)

(MORE)
 
3.

OZ (cont'd)
Now, this is no common, ordinary
flea -- no, this is a flea with
dreams, who dreams of someday

becoming a shining white dove.

A VOICE seems to cry out from the side of the stage --

VOICE
That’s crazy!

OZ
(cups an ear)

What’s that?	What’s that you say?

VOICE
I’m saying it can’t be done, turn a flea into a dove!

The Voice is Oz’s own -- he’s a damned good ventriloquist.

OZ
A naysayer, eh?	Well then:
Witness and observe.

He deftly passes one hand over the other -- and now he’s holding a LARGE WHITE EGG. He places it in a SMALL, BARRED CAGE, covers it with a cloth, raises it up, snaps off the cloth, and... there’s now a LITTLE WHITE BUNNY RABBIT inside -- and Oz appears perplexed...

OZ
But... that’s not a dove.	Let’s
try this again.

He covers the cage once more, holds it high -- then SNIFFLES.

OZ
Sorry.	I’m allergic to rabbits.

Then suddenly he SNEEZES -- such a tremendous ah-choo that he lets go of the cage and doubles over in two -- and the cage somehow, magically, stays right where it is -- just hovering in mid-air -- a pretty neat trick, actually -- then Oz straightens up and, with a flourish, he snaps the cloth off the cage to reveal: a SNOWY WHITE DOVE. Oz opens the cage door, the dove flies out, Oz takes another bow -- and this time, one well-dressed, very ATTRACTIVE WOMAN actually does applaud. Her HUSBAND, a stern-looking character with a waxed mustache and a bowler hat, silences her with a scowl.

Disappointment flickers across Oz’s face -- an artist unappreciated... his shoulders slump, his head droops... then he quickly glances up again -- with a wickedly sly grin.
 
4.


OZ
I know what you want...

He starts striding the stage like a barnstorming preacher.

OZ
Yes, I can see that you’ve come here today in search of more than just Magic and Illusion. You’re here, Brothers and Sisters, because of a burning thirst -- you’re here because, in these most difficult times, you’re looking for something that will soothe your tortured spirits and ease your troubled minds. And I am here to tell you good people...
(hands in prayer)
... I might have just the thing.

He drags a TALL MAGICIAN’S WARDROBE CHEST to the front of the stage, flings open its double doors to reveal: BOTTLES AND BOTTLES OF HIGH-OCTANE HOOCH.

OZ
Behold, my friends, a very special batch of my very own Homeopathic Ontological Miracle Elixir -- H.O.M.E. or “Home” I call it, and believe me, there’s no better place or product anywhere on this green earth -- a hundred and eighty proof and only fifty cents a bottle!

And this is indeed what the crowd’s been waiting for. They surge towards the stage, waving their money in the air.

OZ
Easy now!	Easy!	There’s plenty
for everyone!
(as he’s raking it in)

Mr. Morgan, good to see you again! Mr. Gulch, how’s the banking biz? Mr. Hamilton, you’re looking well -- and your lovely wife? Oh there she is! -- glad you both could make it.

MR. HAMILTON’s the man who scowled his pretty wife silent before -- and we see that MRS. HAMILTON’s standing towards the back of the tent, watching as her husband toddles off with his drinking buddies -- then she turns a very warm and inviting smile towards Oz...
 
5.


EXT./INT. OZ’S EXHIBITION TENT - A LITTLE LATER

The show’s over, the crowd’s gone. And behind a curtain to the side of the stage we find... Oz and Mrs. Hamilton -- locked in a torrid embrace.

OZ
You do know how to bewitch a man, Margaret. Your emerald eyes, your ruby lips...

MRS. HAMILTON
(nuzzling his neck)
If I’m such an enchantress, why
can’t I ever cast a spell that

would get you to stay?

OZ
Stay?	You mean here?	In Kansas?
I could never do that.

MRS. HAMILTON
Why not?	I’m in Kansas.

OZ
Yes, and you’re the only glimmer of color in this gray land.

MRS. HAMILTON
(laughs)

The only glimmer? And those other women of yours --?

OZ
Are mere baubles.	You, my dear,
are the one true jewel.
(she kisses him, then)

You know I can’t stay -- all this endless, empty sky -- I’m telling you it’s crushing me. I watched this land grind my Daddy to dust and I’m not gonna let that happen to me! There’s a whirlwind inside me, Margaret, and I don’t know where it’s gonna take me -- I just know there’s a better world out there somewhere, a world of color and light and beauty, where Fortune and Glory are waiting for me! I’ve got diamonds in my future -- I just know it!

He said all that with considerable feeling. He says this with considerably less:
 
6.


OZ
You could come with me.

MRS. HAMILTON
That’s very sweet.	But we both
know you don’t mean it.	Besides,
you know what they say:	“East is
East, West is West, Home Is Best.”

OZ
You sound like a pillow in the

parlor.

MRS. HAMILTON
And I’m soft in all the right

places, too.

OZ
Yes, you are.

Another kiss -- then both pull back. Oz reaches inside his vest, sets that bunny on the floor.

OZ
Now where were we?


EXT. CIRCUS GROUNDS - PICNIC AREA - SAME

Mr. Hamilton and his cronies have just finished the last of their several bottles of snake oil.

MR. HAMILTON
Who’s up for more?

Everyone is, apparently.	They start tottering back to:


INT. OZ’S EXHIBITION TENT - MOMENTS LATER

The men come in, see no one, are about to turn and go when they hear, behind the curtain: A feminine gasp and giggle. Mr. Hamilton angrily strides forward, rips back the curtain -- and finds Oz and Mrs. Hamilton, intertwined.

OZ
I can explain.
(off Hamilton’s glare)

You’re right, I can’t, which means, sir, you’re in luck!

(Hamilton stops, confused) ‘Cause right now, today, absolutely free of charge, you get to watch me... disappear.
 
7.


And he bolts, hightails it out of there. Mrs. Hamilton pseudo-swoons into her husband’s arms, giving Oz just enough time to make his getaway. Mr. Hamilton flings Margaret aside and he and his buddies take off after Oz, and we launch into:


A FURIOUS CIRCUS CHASE -- OZ RUNNING FOR HIS LIFE

DOWN THE MIDWAY... PAST THE MENAGERIE... THROUGH FREAK SHOW ROW -- the freaks and roustabouts doing what they can to help Oz out (and it seems this isn’t the first time an irate husband’s been after Oz), then Oz ducks under a canvas into:

THE BIG TOP -- where he scuttles under the bleachers, sprints across Center Ring -- only to find the exit blocked by Mr. Hamilton and his posse. Oz turns on a dime, swiftly scales the AERIALISTS’ LADDER -- and Hamilton’s right up after him, hot on Oz’s heels, then OZ GRABS THE TRAPEZE -- AND SWINGS OUT... centrifugal force soon swings him back -- Hamilton nearly grabs him -- then when Oz pendulums back the other way again HE LETS GO OF THE TRAPEZE -- free-falls down into the TRAMPOLINE NET, then CATAPULTS right off it and SOMERSAULTS OVER THE HEADS OF HAMILTON’S MEN and zooms out the exit --

FROM THE LIGHTER-THAN-AIR BALLOON: We see Oz racing towards us -- he starts SHIMMYING UP THE MOORING ROPE -- fast enough that an exuberant ON-LOOKER exclaims:

ON-LOOKER
Look at him go! He’s faster than a flying monkey!

And we now see: THE BALLOON HAS THE WORD “OZ” EMBLAZONED ON ITS SIDE. Oz heaves himself into the balloon’s hanging basket -- just as Hamilton and his boys run up, grab hold of the mooring rope, start hauling the balloon back down to earth -- then Frank comes running up with a satchel --

FRANK
Oz!	Here you go!

And he hurls the satchel up to Oz -- Oz catches it, tips his hat in thanks (Frank, of course, is Oz’s long-time assistant and shill) -- then Oz looses the mooring rope and --

THE BALLOON LIFTS SKYWARD -- out of harm’s and Hamilton’s reach -- up and up and up, Oz waving goodbye to everyone -- laughing -- that was fun -- but then he notices: Only Mrs. Hamilton and Frank are waving back at him... everyone else is stopped and turned towards the west... Oz himself looks and --

OZ
Sweet Jumpin’ Jiminy.
 
8.


SEEING: A MASSIVE STORM FRONT -- angry black clouds, closing in fast. Everyone on the ground suddenly breaks and scatters for cover. Oz gulps --

OZ
Looks like we might be in for a bit of a gale.

As if on cue: A vicious gust of wind kicks up, nearly throws Oz out of the basket -- a TIDAL WAVE OF DUST SWEEPS OVER THE CIRCUS, vanishes it from view -- then, to the west, a LONG BLACK SWIRLING FUNNEL starts its malevolent descent from the clouds... OZ HUNKERS DOWN, braces himself, then it hits:


THE STORM OF THE CENTURY

Plunging us into deepest darkness -- howling, hurricane-force winds -- crashes of lightning -- torrents of rain -- and Oz is caught right in the worst of it -- it’s a HELLACIOUS DEATH RIDE -- he’s getting whipped and whirled, bashed and battered -- bellowing Lear-like defiance:

OZ
Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks!

Rage!	Blow!

A DEAFENING CLAP OF THUNDER drowns him out, and abruptly we:

CUT TO:


EXT. OZ - ON THE FLOOR OF THE BALLOON BASKET - MORNING

Dead asleep. Soaking wet. Wisps of steam rising from his clothes because: he’s now bathed in brilliant sunlight. He twitches awake, eyes flicking, relieved to find himself:

OZ
Alive.

He pulls himself up to peer over the side and sees:

AN ENDLESS EXPANSE OF DESERT. Nothing but sun-scorched sand as far as the eye can see.

OZ
I don’t know where on Earth this
is, but... I’ve got a feeling I’m

not in Kansas anymore.

THE BALLOON SAILS ON... and on... and on... and we --

DISSOLVE TO:
 
9.


THE SUN -- blinding, relentless -- the balloon drifts by...


EXT. OZ - ON THE FLOOR OF THE BALLOON BASKET

Looking very much the worse for wear. He scrounges through his magician’s satchel for probably the umpteenth time, looking for something, anything to eat and drink. Pushing aside various gadgets and gizmos, he finds a flask, upends it over his mouth, but... nothing; it’s empty. He finds a crumpled food wrapper, licks the last few specks of crumbs off it... then he pulls out --

A SMALL, NICKEL-PLATED DERRINGER PISTOL... he hefts it, seems to be weighing a decision, but --

OZ
No -- don’t even think it. You’re gonna get out of this.

--	squinting up at the terrible sun, knowing full well that if he doesn’t make it out of this searing Sahara soon, he’s done for. And then: The situation gets even worse. THE ENGINE STARTS TO SPUTTER AND DIE, out of fuel. Oz leaps to his feet, bellows:

OZ
No! You can’t do this! Not here, not now! NOOO! Please-please-please-please-please.

--	caressing the machine -- sweet-talking to it -- he fiddles with it -- tries to fix it -- finally starts hammering on it with his fist.

OZ
Damned technology! Fine, then -- go ahead! -- betray me you Jezebellian jumble of junk! I’ve been in more perilous predicaments than this!
(beat)
... Although, off the top of my
head I can’t quite remember when.

THE BALLOON is quickly losing altitude -- sinking towards the desert sands. Oz realizes this could be it.

OZ
And I never got to see Paris.	Or
the Pyramids.	Or the Taj Mahal,
or... well bust my buttons!
 
10.


SEEING:	DEAD AHEAD -- A TOWERING MOUNTAIN RANGE

Jagged peaks -- soaring into the clouds. And suddenly: A DESERT THERMAL SENDS THE BALLOON SHOOTING SKYWARD -- all Oz can do is hold on and hope for the best... the balloon soars HIGHER AND HIGHER --

INTO THE CLOUDS -- a world of white -- snow-capped mountains below... Oz shivering with the sudden cold...

ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MOUNTAINS -- the balloon drifts down out of the clouds... then it actually crosses...

OVER A RAINBOW... Oz gaping down in wonder at the ROYGBIV stream of colors -- then he sees it, spreading out before him like a lysergic fantasy...


THE LAND OF OZ

And from above it’s astonishingly beautiful -- a riot of color and lushness and light -- everything somehow tinged with yellow... and Oz can’t believe his eyes -- or his incredible good fortune -- murmurs to himself:

OZ
If I’m dreaming don’t wake me.

The balloon continues its graceful descent... Oz continues to marvel -- then he brightens even further when he sees:

OZ
Water.	Water!

A RIVER -- sparkling in the sun. The balloon bumps to the ground right beside it, and Oz leaps from the basket, laughing like a crazy man, RUNS AND THROWS HIMSELF INTO THE WATER -- giddily drinking, splashing, playing -- Hallelujah! Saved! -- but then he can’t help but notice...

PEOPLE -- GATHERED BY THE RIVERSIDE

A lot of people, normal-sized people, all of them oddly dressed in some hue or shade of yellow, and they’re all just gaping at him. Oz comes out of the water, dripping wet -- and all the people take a step or two back. Oz nods hello --

OZ
How do you do?	My name’s Oz.

And they all bow down to him! Like he’s a King or a God -- and Oz doesn’t know what the hell to make of it.
 
11.


OZ
Well that’s... thank you -- that’s very kind. But if you don’t mind my asking: Where am I?

A WINKIE MAN ventures forward -- who looks and sounds a lot like the Winkie Guards did in The Movie.

WINKIE MAN
Why, you’re here, sir.

OZ
Yes, I, I understand that, but...

where, my good man, is here?

WINKIE MAN
The Land of Oz, of course!

OZ
The Land of Oz?	You’re kidding me.
You call this place Oz?

WINKIE MAN
Far as I know that’s been its name since just short of forever.

OZ
If that don’t beat all... I mean,

what are the odds?

And the Winkie Man turns to the others and proclaims:

WINKIE MAN
He’s here! The Great Oz is finally here!

And everyone CHEERS, long and loud -- then they start hugging and kissing and shaking hands with one another -- tremendously happy and relieved, and --

OZ
You people certainly know how to make a stranger feel welcome -- but why all the hullaballoo?

WINKIE MAN
It’s just -- we’ve been waiting ever so long, sir -- and we are all very glad and grateful for what you’re about to do!
 
12.


OZ
And, ah, not to be obtuse, but... what, exactly, is it that I’m about to do?

A SECOND WINKIE MAN steps forward.

WINKIE MAN #2
Deliver us from the Wicked Witch!

OZ
The Wicked what?

But before he can get an answer: All sound abruptly stops -- a sudden hush -- everyone now looking west -- where we see: SOMETHING... FLYING TOWARDS US -- and at first it’s too far away for us to tell what it is, but soon we see it’s:

A YOUNG WOMAN -- TRANSPORTED BETWEEN TWO WINGED MONKEYS

OZ
Am I seeing what I think I’m
seeing?	Flying monkeys?	Now I

know I’m not in Kansas anymore.

And as the Winged Monkeys swoop down and gently set the Young Woman on the ground, the Winkies all bow deeply again. Meet:

THEODORA -- and she is beautiful. Dressed in an open-collared white shirt, black pants, black knee-high boots. She has quick eyes, quick movements, a quick, lively mind -- and Oz likes what he sees.

OZ
You can’t be the Wicked Witch.

THEODORA
(laughs)

Is that what they told you?

OZ
No.	But they did just mention
something about there being a

Wicked Witch, so --

THEODORA
Well, I am a Witch -- but do I look wicked to you?

She smiles -- he smiles back, with charm --

OZ
On the contrary.
 
13.


THEODORA
They were no doubt referring to the Witch of the South, who is indeed very wicked and who is trying to overthrow my sister the Queen.
(then, looking past him)
Is that yours?

-- gesturing towards the still semi-inflated balloon.

OZ
Yes, yes it is.

THEODORA
Why does it say “Oz” on it?

OZ
‘Cause that’s my name. Oscar Zoroaster Phineas Isaac Norman Henkle Emmanuel Ambroise Diggs, at your service.
(tips his hat, grins)
You can call me Oz.

THEODORA
I’m Theodora.
(then)

So, Oz, tell me:	What are you?

OZ
What am I? Why, I’m an American -- a Kansas man, born and bred.

THEODORA
But are you a Wizard?	Or a
Sorcerer? -- as the Winkies here

seem to believe?

OZ
The Winkies?

THEODORA
These are the Winkies. You landed in Winkie County, the western-most quarter of the Land of Oz.

OZ
And they think I’m a Wizard?

THEODORA
Why wouldn’t they?  You just came out of the clouds, you fell from the sky, and you call yourself Oz. (really needs to know --)
(MORE)
 
14.

THEODORA (cont'd)
So: Are you a Wizard? The Wizard we’ve all been waiting for?

And Oz can’t help himself -- the showman in him takes over.

OZ
As a matter of fact, back home I am known as something of a Wizard -- a Wizard of Pyrotechnics and Prestidigitation -- I’m also a renowned charlatan and a Master of Illusion -- and if you good folks would permit me just a moment of your kind indulgence, allow me to both Illustrate and Amaze!

He struts over to the balloon, takes his satchel from the basket -- (the satchel, by the way, also has the name “OZ” embossed upon it) -- he picks out a few props and --

OZ
Okay, gather around everyone -- proximity only adds to the wonder -- can I have a volunteer? How about you, madam? That’s right -- don’t be shy...

And as Oz starts his shtick we: FOCUS ON THEODORA... who’s watching Oz very closely -- watching his magic and, more important, she’s watching the effect his tricks are having on the Winkies, because: Watching Oz’s act, the Winkies are becoming more and more convinced that Oz does have Special Powers -- that he is, in fact, a Wizard -- and it’s hard to tell how Theodora feels about that... Oz finishes, takes a bow, turns to Theodora and ta-da’s.

THEODORA
So you are a Wizard, aren’t you?

OZ
Seeing is believing -- and I try never to contradict a pretty lady’s eyes.

He smiles -- like a fox -- she smiles back, says --

THEODORA
Well, then...

She gives a quick flick of her hand, and: LIGHTNING FLASHES FROM HER FINGERTIPS -- ARCS INTO THE BALLOON and --
 
15.


KA-BOOOOOM! -- THE BALLOON ERUPTS IN A GIANT FIREBALL -- a huge hydrogen conflagration -- towering flames -- the Winkies shielding themselves and cowering -- Oz is sputtering --

OZ
Wh-wh-wh-what’d you do that for!

THEODORA
(sweet as spun sugar)

I couldn’t just let you leave, could I? -- my sister would never forgive me. She could use a Great Wizard like you.

OZ
Use me?	For what?

THEODORA
To help her defeat the Wicked Witch once and for all.

OZ
And you think I can do that?

THEODORA
I think you should come to the Emerald City and speak to my dear sister. And you should know: My sister is a very powerful Witch... you help her and I’m sure she’d
give you anything you ever
wanted...

OZ
Anything I ever wanted... and she

can do that, your sister?

THEODORA
She can make your every dream come true.

OZ
(greedy grin)

Y’know that doesn’t sound half bad.

THEODORA
No it doesn’t, does it?

Oz glances towards the burning balloon.

OZ
And, circumstances being as they
are:	Tell you what.
(MORE)
 
16.

OZ (cont'd)
I will henceforth and immediately
cancel all my planned and prior
engagements, and I will speak to
your noble sister -- Wizard to
Witch, as it were -- see what we
can arrange.

Theodora signals to NIKKO, one of the Winged Monkeys, who flaps to her side, hands her some parchment and a quill.

THEODORA
I’ll send word, let her know we’re on our way.

OZ
We?	You’re coming with me?

THEODORA
(writing)

There could be... dangers along the way. The Emerald City’s a full day’s walk from here -- at the end of the Yellow Brick Road.

OZ
We’re walking?

She rolls up her note, hands it to Nikko, who flies off.

THEODORA
This one will carry your things.

KALA’S the other Winged Monkey.	He fetches Oz’s satchel.

OZ
But why are we walking?	You’re a
Witch -- you don’t have a broom?

THEODORA
What would I do with a broom?

OZ
You could fly us to your sister’s.

THEODORA
With a broom?	I don’t understand.

OZ
(sees she’s not joking)

Never mind.

Then he leaps up on a tree stump, booms to the Winkies --
 
17.


OZ
Before we go I just wanted to thank you one and all for your wonderfully warm welcome and your heartfelt hospitality -- I’m never going to forget it and I hope to see around next time -- you’ve been a great crowd!

He hops back down, says to Theodora --

OZ
This place we’re going --

THEODORA
The Emerald City.

OZ
I do like that name -- green,
y’understand, has always been my
favorite color.
(rubs his hands and grins)
Let’s go, then -- no time to waste
--	opportunity awaits!

They start out -- not on the Yellow Brick Road yet; the road here is just cobblestone -- Kala monkey-walking behind them -- the Winkies bowing deeply in farewell -- and when they rise:

Winkie #2 sees the troubled look on Winkie #1’s face.

WINKIE MAN #2
What is it?

Winkie #1 just frowns, shakes his head -- shakes off his concern -- then shouts to the others --

WINKIE MAN
Spread the word, far and near:	The
Great Oz is finally here!


EXT. EN ROUTE TO THE EMERALD CITY - OZ, THEODORA AND KALA

Through rolling farmland, past curious-looking houses -- which all look vaguely like human faces.

OZ
So tell me about this Wicked Witch.

THEODORA
Her Father was the King -- a very
powerful Wizard and a very Evil
King.

(MORE)
 
18.

THEODORA (cont'd)
The Wicked Witch of the South is also very Evil -- and a very powerful Sorceress -- stronger even than my sister.

OZ
But your sister’s the Queen.

THEODORA
My sister has me to help and protect her -- and she has the love of the Good People of Oz.

We see that Kala’s frowning, as Theodora says, musingly --

THEODORA
They used to be friends, you know, my Sister and the Wicked Witch...
but she had no idea how wicked wickedness could be, or how easily friendship could be betrayed.
(then)
Ah -- there it is -- the Yellow

Brick Road.

IN THE DISTANCE: THE YELLOW BRICK ROAD -- on the other side of a thunderous RIVER.


EXT. THE RIVER

Up close we now see that the river’s wide, fast, and deep.

OZ
How we going to get across?

THEODORA
We’ll walk.

Oz looks dubious -- as Kala picks leaves off a strange-looking bush. Theodora takes a few, hands them to Oz.

THEODORA
Here.	Rub these on the bottom of
your shoes.

Kala pantomimes how to do it. Theodora rubs leaves on the bottoms of her boots -- Oz follows suit, then watches as Theodora steps out on the water -- and that’s onto the water, not into the water -- and Oz can’t believe it, can’t wait to try it himself -- and he strides out, and when he sees he’s not going to sink he laughs with absolute delight, as --

OZ AND THEODORA LITERALLY WALK ON WATER
 
19.


And Oz is about as graceful as a baby giraffe -- he’s new to this, and it’s hard to keep your balance when white-water’s whooshing and swooshing beneath your feet -- so he teeters and totters, several times he nearly falls -- laughing his fool head off all the while -- Theodora walks across stately as a queen -- Kala wings his way to the other side -- and when they all reach dry land --

OZ
That’s the most fun I ever had

outside of St. Louis.

Then he sees, right up close now, glowing golden in the sun:


THE YELLOW BRICK ROAD

OZ
But that looks... no, it can’t be.

He rushes forward, drops to his knees, starts scratching at the Yellow Brick, then exclaims --

OZ
It is!	Look at this!	This is
pure, solid gold!
(Theodora’s unimpressed)

You don’t find this incredible?

THEODORA
They don’t have roads where you

come from?

OZ
Not paved with gold, no -- except

in people’s dreams.

THEODORA
Then you’ve come to the right place

--	‘cause I assure you, Wizard, this is no dream.

OZ
Well in that case... for the behoovement of the common good and in the interest of one and all I think it’d probably be best if I took one of these little beauties along with me...

He starts prying loose one of the Gold Bricks.
 
20.


OZ
Strictly for scientific purposes, you understand -- to ascertain and ensure that this is in fact the eighteen-carat Real McCoy rather than pyrite -- iron disulfide -- Fool’s Gold, in the vernacular. A Public Service I’m only too happy to provide gratis, free of charge.

He slips the Brick into his pocket and stands.

OZ
The Emerald City’s this way?

THEODORA
Follow the Yellow Brick Road.


EXT. ON THE YELLOW BRICK ROAD - A LITTLE LATER

Oz spots:	AN ENCHANTED APPLE ORCHARD.

OZ
Apples!	I’m starving!

THEODORA
I’d ask first if I were you.

OZ
Ask who?	There’s nobody --

THEODORA
Them. The apples are theirs, after all -- and they can be quite picky.

Oz frowns, but when in Rome... so he bows to the trees and --

OZ
Excuse me, hate to bother you, but my companions and I were wondering if perhaps you could spare us a couple of your fine-looking apples.

He waits. Nothing happens. Oz glances back at Theodora, is about to just go and pick an apple anyway, when --

ONE OF THE APPLE BRANCHES FLICKS TOWARDS HIM -- like it’s swatting away a fly -- and three apples sail through the air, tumble to the ground, roll to a stop at Oz’s feet.
 
21.


OZ
Uh, thank you -- appreciate it.
(picks up the apples,
remarks to himself)

Remarkable.

Then he offers an apple to Theodora, who says --

THEODORA
No.	Thank you.

OZ
C’mon, you’ve gotta eat.

THEODORA
(smiles)

You don’t know much about Witches, do you?

OZ
I wouldn’t say that -- I’ve known plenty of Witches in my time, believe me. There was a Witch I knew in Wichita -- you want to talk about wicked?
(shudders at the memory)
She had a face lovely as a summer
day -- and a heart as black as a

Midnight Grave.

He tosses an apple to Kala, takes a bite of his own, Theodora looking as though she’s still trying to figure this guy out.

THEODORA
We should go.	It’ll be getting
dark soon.


EXT. IN THE HAUNTED FOREST

Deep, dark, forboding. A YELLOW-EYED OWL hoots from a tree. Below, Oz adds another armful of wood to a cold woodpile, then steps back -- as Theodora flashes lightning out of her fingertips again -- THE WOODPILE BURSTS INTO FLAME --

OZ
Someday you’ve really got to teach me that.
 
22.


EXT. THE CAMPFIRE - LATER THAT NIGHT

Theodora’s staring thoughtfully into the fire -- Kala’s picking bugs off his fur (and eating them) -- and Oz is at his satchel -- slips that purloined Gold Brick into the case, then takes something out...

OZ
Thought we could do with a little

music.

Shows her: A BEAUTIFUL LITTLE MUSIC BOX. He winds it up, sets it on the ground -- MOZART STARTS TO PLAY... and Theodora’s face lights up with an almost-childlike wonder and delight -- completely charmed --

THEODORA
What is that?

OZ
It’s Mozart.

THEODORA
Why’s it called a Mozart?

OZ
No, the music is Mozart.	This is a
Music Box -- you’ve never seen one?
Then here -- take it -- it’s yours.

A gift, from me to you.

THEODORA
Why?	Why would you do that?

OZ
No reason -- I just want you to

have it.

She hesitates -- then holds out her hand...

THEODORA
No one’s ever given me something

just because he wanted to.

OZ
I can’t believe that -- pretty lady like you? I bet there are lots of men out there who’d give you the world if they could.

THEODORA
Like I said:	you don’t know much
about Witches, do you?
 
23.


OZ
Maybe not, but I’m told I’m a
pretty fast learner.
(stands, extends a hand)
Dance, m’lady?
(off her look)
Now you’re gonna tell me no one’s
ever danced with you before?

THEODORA
(almost a whisper)

No one ever has.

OZ
Then it’s high time you learned a

little something.	C’mon.

And he reaches down, hauls her to her feet -- takes the Music Box from her, winds it up again and sets it down -- then he turns to her as the MUSIC STARTS TO PLAY --

OZ
Okay, then -- put your hand up --
like this.	Good.	Now put your

other hand around me like so...

He takes hold of her up-raised hand, puts his right arm around her, gets a little closer and says --

OZ
Now just try and feel the music,

and follow me...

They start to DANCE -- Kala watching them very closely -- their bodies touching -- backlit by the fire, and --

CLOSE ON THEODORA’S FACE -- and it’s true: she’s never danced with a man -- never been held by a man -- she’s never before felt some of the things she’s feeling now...

OZ
You seem a little nervous.

THEODORA
This is all... new to me.

OZ
It always is -- every time.

She glances up -- their eyes lock and hold. The music ends -- and she takes a step back -- voice shaky --
 
24.


THEODORA
I... the fire, I’ll -- I’ll gather some more wood.

She flitters off into the darkness -- Kala scuttling after her -- and Oz shakes his head, chides himself --

OZ
You’re the wicked one, Oscar Diggs.

WITH THEODORA -- RUNNING -- STUMBLING -- THROUGH THE WOODS

Excited, frightened, confused -- hand to her belly, as if she’s trying to quell the strange new emotions within -- Kala still looking at her with great interest -- then he glances up, hears the flapping of wings and --

NIKKO SWOOPS IN -- TOUCHES DOWN -- has just returned from Evanora’s -- he hands Theodora a rolled parchment -- Theodora unwraps and reads it, tells the two Monkeys --

THEODORA
My sister wants me to be sure this Wizard’s a real Wizard.
(thinks a moment, then)

Fetch me a rabbit.

BACK AT THE CAMPFIRE -- Oz berates his hound-dog self --

OZ
Innocent girl like that?	You
oughta be ashamed of yourself.

BACK TO THEODORA -- as Nikko brings her back a fluffy tan-colored little bunny.

THEODORA
Set it down.

Nikko obeys. Kala returns -- watches from a distance, as... Theodora stares fixedly at the bunny -- the bunny quivering with fear -- then Theodora smiles, does something with her hands and, just like that:

THE LITTLE BUNNY TRANSFORMS INTO A FULL-GROWN LION. The Monkeys shrink back -- ready to fly away if need be.

THEODORA
(to the Lion)

Listen close, then do as I say.
 
25.


EXT. BACK AT THE CAMPFIRE

Oz is poking at the fire with a stick, when he hears: A rustling in the woods. He peers into the darkness.

OZ
Theodora?	That you?

No response. But then he hears: A low, guttural growl. And, very slowly, Oz pulls a tree branch from the fire, the end of which is burning like a torch. He calls out again --

OZ
Theodora?

AND WITH AN EARTHSHAKING ROAR THE LION ATTACKS! -- comes CHARGING out of the darkness, MAKES A MURDEROUS LEAP AT OZ --

OZ HITS THE DECK -- THE LION GOES SAILING OVER HIM -- Oz quickly body-rolls to his satchel -- desperately tries to open it with one hand, the other waving that burning branch at the Lion -- and we see:

THEODORA -- IN THE TREES -- keeping to the shadows -- moving to get a better ringside view, as --

THE LION CIRCLES... Oz, on one knee, gets the satchel open -- shakes the burning branch at the beast --

OZ
Stay back!	I’m warning you!
(his other hand fumbling
inside the satchel)

C’mon -- c’mon -- where is it?

THE LION ROARS -- then charges Oz again! -- and Oz, still kneeling, whips his arm out of the satchel, brings it up and:

BANG! He SHOOTS the leaping Lion with that Derringer of his! The Lion YOWLS in pain, then TURNS TAIL AND FLEES INTO THE FOREST -- whimpering -- and --

OZ
That’s right!	Run!	Run, you
coward!	And don’t come back!
(checks the gun, mutters
to himself --)

‘Cause I’m fresh out of bullets.

And thus the Cowardly Lion was born -- perhaps -- and -- THEODORA -- STILL IN THE TREES -- smiles, says --
 
26.


THEODORA
Satisfied, Sister?

--	like she knows Evanora can hear her, even though Evanora’s miles away... she then gestures Nikko over, pens another quick note to her sister -- Nikko flies off with it and --

BACK IN THE CLEARING -- Oz turns as Theodora comes dashing out of the woods -- she runs to him, all a-flutter --

THEODORA
What happened!	I heard this
roaring, then a bang!

OZ
It was nothing.	I just...
(wipes sweat off his face) I just fended off a large carnivorous, uh, carnivore -- no big deal -- back where I come from we do that practically every day...
(he sees his hand is
shaking like a leaf) Decorum alone prevented me from tussling with the beast bare-handed

--	so I just gave him a little taste of this --

(shows her the gun)
And he went scampering off like a scared little rabbit.

THEODORA
What an odd-looking wand.

OZ
Wand? Oh, right, yes, well -- it certainly worked its magic tonight, didn’t it? And don’t worry -- I made sure he didn’t hurt Mozart.

He hands her the Music Box -- and she’s quite touched.

THEODORA
Thank you, Wizard.

Their eyes connect again, and --

THEODORA
We should get some sleep. We still have a long way to go tomorrow.
