EXT. ON THE CAMPFIRE - LATER THAT NIGHT

And we see: Oz is asleep -- Kala’s asleep -- Theodora’s awake -- holding the Music Box -- staring at it...

EXT. FURTHER ALONG THE YELLOW BRICK ROAD - FOLLOWING MORNING

Oz, Theodora and Kala come out of the forest -- into brown-hued Central Oz -- then Oz abruptly stops, seeing...

EMERALD CITY:	IN THE DISTANCE

A spectacular soaring skyline -- Sleeping Beauty’s Castle on steroids -- and Oz is appropriately awed.

OZ
The Emerald City... I’ve seen it

before, you know.

THEODORA
You have?

OZ
In my wildest dreams.	Come on!

--	quickening the pace -- he can’t wait to get there -- and Theodora laughs -- his enthusiasm’s infectious, and --

EXT. CLOSER TO EMERALD CITY - STILL ON THE YELLOW BRICK ROAD

They pass through a LARGE FIELD STREWN WITH BOULDERS... THEN THE BOULDERS START TO MOVE... and it quickly becomes apparent that the rocks are really turtle-shell-shaped concave shields, under which have been hiding:

A BATTALION OF GNOMES -- short, squat, fierce-looking warriors with skin the color and texture of stone and beards so long they tie them around their waists -- and they’re all armed to the teeth: Broadswords, cutlasses, battle-axes...

OZ goes still, then sees, even worse --

ON THE SURROUNDING HILLSIDES: MORE SAVAGE WARRIORS -- a mix of GROWLEYWOGS -- silent, half-clad, eight-foot-tall Aboriginals armed with knives and bows and arrows and spears

--	and WHIMSIES -- who are distinguished by their extraordinarily broad shoulders and the enormous crazy-colored papier-mache MARDI GRAS MASKS they wear on their amazingly-undersized heads.
 
28.


OZ
Get behind me.

THEODORA
Don’t hurt them.	They’re here to
escort us to my sister.

OZ
(hiding immense relief)

They are? Then lucky for them you stayed my hand -- I was about to smite the lot of them!

The Savage Horde forms a protective cordon around them, starts marching them towards the city, chanting:

SAVAGE HORDE
Oh-we-oh, yo ho!	Oh-we-oh, yo-ho!

Then we hear:	A FANFARE OF TRUMPETS -- and jump to:


EXT. EMERALD CITY - DAY

As the jewel-studded gates swing open to reveal: Sheer magnificence -- towering towers, soaring spires, flowers, fountains -- everything glittering and gleaming -- a MARCHING BAND files in and leads Oz and Theodora into the city, into:


EXT. CENTRAL SQUARE - EMERALD CITY

BELLS are RINGING -- young girls strew rose petals in their path -- all the sidewalks and balconies are lined with WILDLY CHEERING CROWDS -- a hodgepodge of Oz inhabitants from all four corners of the Kingdom: WINKIES from the West, MUNCHKINS from the East, GILLIKINS from the North and QUADLINGS from the South -- all dressed in different regional colors and all enthusiastically waving and fluttering green-and-white flags and pennants, and --

OZ is eating this up -- waving to the throng like he’s a returning war hero or a campaigning politician -- laughing --

OZ
What, no fireworks?

THEODORA
What are fireworks?

They pass through the ARCH OF TRIUMPH -- heading towards the
Emerald Palace -- and what Oz isn’t seeing is:
 
29.


BEHIND THE SCENES -- EVANORA’S PALACE GUARD -- uniformed bully-boys passing out the flags and banners, and they’re making damned sure the Citizens of Em City are cheering Oz’s entrance with sufficient gusto -- or else... giving us a sense that things might not be quite what they seem here in the Merry Old Land of Oz...


EXT. THE PALACE

Grand -- glorious -- Theodora leads Oz inside.


INT. THE GRAND ENTRANCE HALL OF THE PALACE

THE JOINT CHIEFS OF THE SAVAGE ARMY nod deferentially to Theodora as she leads Oz through the enormous double doors at the other end of the hall, into:


INT. AN INCREDIBLY LONG VAULTED CORRIDOR

Seems to stretch on forever -- and at the end there’s another set of tall double doors which open all by themselves, into:

INT. THE THRONE ROOM

And there she is, seated majestically on the EMERALD THRONE:

EVANORA -- THE QUEEN OF OZ. She’s also the Witch of the East. She’s older than Theodora, but no less attractive. A very powerful presence -- with a penetrating gaze.

THEODORA
Wizard, my sister Evanora.

Oz nods to her.	Evanora sounds curious, almost amused --

EVANORA
You do not kneel.

OZ
No, ma’am, I do not.

EVANORA
But I am Queen.

OZ
And I’m an American -- and

Americans kneel to no one.

A beat -- then Evanora smiles -- practically purrs --
 
30.


EVANORA
Oh, Sister, I like him already.
(back to Oz)
An American, you say -- I’m not
familiar with the word.	You’re

also a Wizard, I’m told.

OZ
Not just a Wizard -- the Wizard
you’ve all been waiting for --
here, in the flesh, and at Your

Majesty’s service.

Another Evanora smile, then --

EVANORA
You’ve had a long journey, I’m sure you’d like a bath and a bed. These girls will show you to your room.

She waves a hand -- TWO MUNCHKIN MAIDS waddle up to Oz.

EVANORA
We’ll speak some more at dinner.

OZ
I’m looking forward to it.

Each girl takes a hand and they lead Oz away -- Kala toddling after them toting Oz’s satchel. Evanora waits until they’re gone, then turns to her sister.

EVANORA
You’re certain, then, that he’s a

Wizard?

THEODORA
You saw what he could do.

EVANORA
Yes, I did see.	I saw it all.

-- gesturing towards:	her CRYSTAL BALL -- then --

EVANORA
I saw then what I see now...
(a big Big Sister’s smile)
You like him, don’t you?... and you

want him to like you...

Theodora -- almost blushing -- can’t meet her sister’s eyes -- as Evanora comes up close to her -- circling...
 
31.


EVANORA
And who can blame you?	You’re
still so young... and you still
have feelings, don’t you?
Stirrings and... yearnings...
(mysterious smile)
You did the right thing, dear,
bringing him here...


INT. OZ’S CHAMBERS - SAME

The Munchkin Maids curtsey their way out the door -- Oz looks around the room, which is sumptuous as sin --

OZ
Not bad... not bad at all.
(then, to Kala)

Y’know something, Monkey? Just between you, me and these four walls? Methinks yours truly has finally hit the Mother Lode, landed feet first in the Pot at the End of the Rainbow, smelling like a rose.
(grins)
And if you don’t think I’m gonna take full advantage, you don’t know Mr. Oscar Diggs -- otherwise known as... The Wizard You’ve All Been Waiting For -- The One and Only Wizard of Oz!

Kala frowns -- Oz bursts out laughing, and we go --


INT. GRAND DINING ROOM - THAT NIGHT

Oz and the Sisters are the only ones sitting at a long oaken table which could easily seat fifty. Oz finishes what has been a real belly-buster of a meal.

OZ
A royal repast fit for a King, if I do say so myself.

EVANORA
(smiles, then)

Sister? Leave us, won’t you? I’d like to speak to the Wizard alone.

Theodora gives Oz a quick smile -- and leaves the room. Oz watches her go -- then Evanora stands, says:
 
32.


EVANORA
Walk with me.

Oz graciously offers her his arm -- she takes it and the two stroll out to --


INT. THE INCREDIBLY LONG VAULTED CORRIDOR

EVANORA
My sister’s very pretty, isn’t she?

OZ
Yes.	She is.

EVANORA
And she speaks most highly of you.

OZ
Does she.

EVANORA
It seems you made quite the
impression.	She says you just...

fell from the sky...

OZ
I do like to make an entrance.

EVANORA
Yes -- but why here, of all places?

Why did you come to Oz?

Oz shrugs -- obliquely -- maintaining the mystery --

OZ
Could’ve been happenstance...
could’ve been serendipity... or
maybe it was Destiny... could’ve

been Fate.

EVANORA
Whatever it was, I’m glad you’re
here.	Come, I want to show you

something.


INT. OUTSIDE THE ROOM OF RESPLENDENCE

Two Savage Guards are on either side of an Archway -- and the interior of the arch is A CURTAIN OF BURNING FIRE.
 
33.


Evanora gestures to the Guards: Begone -- they move off -- then Evanora gives a little wave of her hand and the Curtain of Fire goes out, revealing a STOUT WOODEN DOOR -- with iron bands and multiple locks. Another wave of Evanora’s hand and the locks fly open, the door swings open by itself, and Evanora ushers Oz into:


INT. THE ROOM OF RESPLENDENCE

The Royal Repository of THE CROWN JEWELS OF OZ -- gemstones and jewels everywhere you look -- thousands of them, sparkling with the brilliance of a million suns... and Oz is gaping -- while trying to sound blase.

OZ
This is, uh, quite the little piggy bank you’ve got here, Highness.

EVANORA
You like it? Theodora told me how much you seem to enjoy bright and shiny things.

There’s a TREASURE CHEST filled with GLEAMING GOLD COINS. Oz runs his fingers through them like water -- then PALMS one of the coins, disappears it up his sleeve as he moves on and picks up an Emerald the size of an Ostrich Egg.

OZ
Y’know, with this stone alone, I could buy the state of Kansas -- and probably half of Nebraska along with it.

EVANORA
It’s yours if you want...

Oz stops -- what? -- and Evanora smiles, says --

EVANORA
Along with this...

And she holds up: THE DIAMOND DAGGER -- which has a 6-inch blade of razor-sharp steel, a cross guard of filigreed gold, and a hilt that’s totally ENCRUSTED WITH GLITTERING DIAMONDS.

EVANORA
And all you’ve got to do is... kill the Wicked Witches.

OZ
Witches? Plural? You mean there’s more than one?
 
34.


EVANORA
Don’t tell me you didn’t know.

OZ
About --?

EVANORA
My dear sister.

OZ
Your sister --?

EVANORA
I know why she brought you here.

OZ
She brought me here to help you.

EVANORA
She brought you here to kill me.

OZ
Kill you?	No.	With all due
respect, Highness, you’ve got it

all wrong --

EVANORA
What did she promise you? That the two of you would share my Throne and Crown? Tell me you weren’t foolish enough to believe it.
(steps close, hisses)
But you can believe this: After she seduced you into killing me she’d have eaten you like a spider. So take this...

She grabs his hand, presses the Diamond Dagger to his palm.

EVANORA
... And prove to me you’re the Wizard you say you are -- the Wizard we’ve all been waiting for.

She steps back -- and STARTS TO DEMATERIALIZE.

EVANORA
Kill my sister, then together you and I will defeat the Witch of the South once and for all.
(vanishing)
Kill my sister, Wizard -- and
you’ll be King.
 
35.


She’s gone -- disappeared into thin air -- and Oz just stands there -- staring -- trying to process... then looks down at the Dagger in his hand -- then, abruptly, he jams it in the back of his belt and goes tearing out of there --


INT. THE INCREDIBLY LONG VAULTED CORRIDOR

Sprinting -- no time to waste -- then up some stone stairs --


INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE THE ROYAL BEDCHAMBERS Oz running -- shouting --
OZ

Theodora!	Theodora, where are you!

After a moment, a door slowly opens -- Theodora looks out -- with a faint, expectant smile --

THEODORA
Wizard?	What is it?

-- like she’s both scared and thrilled to find him here -- ready for whatever he’s got in mind, but --

OZ
We’ve got to get you out of here!

Behind her we see a SHADOW swiftly sliding along the wall.

THEODORA
Why?	What --?

Then: Shazam! That Shadow becomes Evanora -- who with a quick angry flick of her hand sends OZ FLYING THROUGH THE AIR

--	magically -- telekinetically -- bashing him up against the far wall -- as Theodora wheels on her sister --

THEODORA
What are you doing!

EVANORA
Saving your silly life!	He came
here to kill you!

OZ
Theodora, no, don’t listen to her!

Another flick of her hand and now Oz is GAGGING -- CHOKING -- can’t talk, can’t breathe -- as Evanora says to her sister --
 
36.


EVANORA
You don’t believe me?

Another flick of her hand sends Oz SLAMMING AGAINST THE CEILING -- then she BOUNCES him off the marble floor, flipping him upside down, and as he does --

THE DIAMOND DAGGER, jarred loose, falls from his belt, hits the ground at Theodora’s feet. Theodora stares.

EVANORA
Out of nowhere he suddenly appears

--	you think that was an accident? No! She sent him here -- sent him here to destroy us!

THEODORA
No, I don’t believe that -- I --

EVANORA
Unless, of course, it wasn’t she

who sent him...

One final flick of the hand and Oz is RAMMED HEAD-FIRST into the far wall again -- knocking him cold.

EVANORA
Perhaps it was someone else...

(moves threateningly near) Tomorrow I’ll know... tomorrow your Wizard and I are going to have a little talk...

And we can tell from Theodora’s expression that ‘A little talk’ means something absolutely horrible.

EVANORA
Tomorrow I’ll learn the truth...
and believe me, Sister...
(strokes Theodora’s hair)
I do so hope I find out you were

nothing more than naive...

Theodora reddens like she’d been slapped. Evanora SNAPS HER FINGERS -- a few SAVAGE GUARDSMEN appear.

EVANORA
Take him downstairs.


INT. DUNGEON - OZ’S CELL - NIGHT

Oz slowly wakens -- finds he’s CHAINED TO A STONE WALL.
 
37.


GNOME GUARD	(O.S.)
Look who’s back amongst the living.

TWO SAVAGE GUARDS -- a GNOME and a WHIMSIE -- taunt Oz through the small barred grille of the thick cell door.

GNOME GUARD
The Great and Powerful Wizard
himself.	How about showing us a

little magic, Wizard?

WHIMSIE GUARD
Yeah, let’s see you get out of them locks and chains --

GNOME GUARD
Perhaps he wants what the Queen’s

got in store for him.

OZ
(trying not to show fear)
What’s she going to do, turn me

into a newt?

GNOME GUARD
Oh, no.	No, nothing like that.
(beat)

Torture, more like.

WHIMSIE GUARD
The Queen’s got a real taste for
it.	So do I.	Slow roasting’s my

favorite.

GNOME GUARD
I like a good flaying myself.
Flesh makes such a fine meal

afterwards.

-- slurping like he’s sucking down a strand of fettucine as --

OZ
So what’s with the beard?

GNOME GUARD
My beard?

OZ
They don’t have barbers around
here?	A family of rats could be
living in there and you’d never

know it.
 
38.


GNOME GUARD
Maybe so, but this here is my pride and joy, the source of my vast potency and strength.

WHIMSIE GUARD
Or so those ignorant creatures believe. You want to beat a Gnome in battle, just have a whack at that beard of his and he’ll go hieing home to his mommy quick as you please.

GNOME GUARD
And if you want to defeat a Whimsie all you’ve got to do is knock that great silly contraption off his shoulders and that’s the last you’ll see of him I assure you!
(stage-whispers to Oz)
They can’t bear to be seen without their masks, on account of their woefully-wee heads -- no bigger than a Munchkin’s fist.

-- miming the approximate size -- as Oz mutters to himself --

OZ
Good to know.
(then, to them)

And not that this hasn’t been fascinating, fellas, but I wonder if you could do me a favor and just leave me alone.

GNOME GUARD
He wants us to leave him alone.

WHIMSIE GUARD
The man does need his rest.

GNOME GUARD
Aye, all that wailing and screaming he’s gonna be doing tomorrow can be very taxing on an individual.

The Savages share a laugh, move from the door, and Oz starts contorting himself -- tries working his way free of the locks and chains, while --
 
39.


INT. THEODORA’S ROOM - INSIDE THE PALACE

THEODORA -- AT THE WINDOW -- staring out at the night -- Kala sitting in a corner, watching her -- as Theodora frowns, then looks over at:

THE MUSIC BOX -- ON THE VANITY ... she walks to it, winds it up -- Mozart fills the room -- the music touching whatever’s left of her Witch’s heart... then: quickly, abruptly, before she has a chance to change her mind -- she grabs a quill, scribbles a note, bids Kala --

THEODORA
Come here.

She hands him the ROLLED-PARCHMENT NOTE and a KEY.

THEODORA
Bring this to the Wizard -- and let no one else see it. Go.


INT. DUNGEON - OUTSIDE OZ’S CELL

The Savage Guards start hearing VOICES FROM INSIDE THE CELL.

VARIOUS VOICES
I’ll take the pinhead... I’ll take the hairy one... and I’ll get the door... don’t worry, Wizard, we’ll have you out of here in no time.

The Voices are Oz’s, of course -- but the Guards don’t know that, and simultaneously lunge to the cell door and see:

IN THE CELL: Nothing. And no one -- no sign of Oz -- just those now-empty chains against the wall. The Guards fumble for their keys -- then yank the door open -- rush inside, weapons drawn -- still see bupkis, then --

Oz drops down behind them from his hand-hold above the door, snatches the Gnome’s key ring, then quick as a flash he’s out the door, slams it shut behind him, and --

OZ
Fare thee well, boys! -- don’t forget to write -- and you can tell that Queen of yours I hope someday a house falls on her head!

And he’s gone -- running --
 
40.


THROUGH THE DUNGEON’S DARK STONE CORRIDORS

Torch-lit shadow -- scurrying rats -- a locked iron door -- Oz tries one key -- then another -- finally heaves it open only to come face-to-face with:

KALA -- who’s so startled he drops THEODORA’S NOTE -- and he freezes -- Oz freezes -- everything hanging in the balance -- what’s the Monkey going to do? -- then:

KALA
Goodness gracious me! We’ve got to get you out of here!

OZ
You... you can talk?

KALA
No time for dilly-dally!	We must
go -- Glinda, she will help us!

OZ
Glinda?

KALA
The Witch of the South.

OZ
(confused)

But... isn’t she the Wicked Witch?

KALA
No-no -- Glinda, she is the Good
Witch -- the Sisters are the Wicked
Ones.	Please, I’ll explain as we
run -- now hurry -- this way --

come-come!


EXT. OUTSIDE EMERALD CITY - NIGHT

Oz and Kala make their swift, silent getaway, and soon --


INT. THRONE ROOM - A LITTLE LATER

The Savage Guards are being grilled by Evanora -- surrounded by Savage Generals -- Theodora at her sister’s side.

GNOME GUARD
... Strike me blind if I’m lying -- he just disappeared like smoke.
 
41.


WHIMSIE GUARD
Cold smoke.	Did you feel the cold?

GNOME GUARD
I did.	Like the very breath of
death it was...

A GROWLEYWOG GUARD comes in... hands Evanora a ROLLED-UP PARCHMENT -- and Theodora’s eyes widen, because she knows: it’s the note she wrote to Oz... and as Evanora scans it --

GNOME GUARD
I’m telling you, Highness, he’s a Great and Powerful Wizard, that one is, believe me.

Evanora looks up from the note -- gazes at Theodora -- then sighs, gives a weary wave of her hand and says --

EVANORA
Take them away, and kill them.

The hapless Guards are dragged off. Evanora then turns to her Generals.

EVANORA
Well, what are you waiting for? You find this Wizard and you bring him to me -- ALIVE! -- and whatever you do, do NOT let him reach the Witch of the South! Now GO!

The Savages skedaddle -- and when the Sisters are alone...

EVANORA
You wound me, Sister -- you really do. What am I to make of this?
(reads the note aloud)
‘I’m sorry -- I never should have
brought you here -- don’t worry I

will help you.’

She lets the parchment flutter from her fingers to the floor.

EVANORA
Did you help him?

THEODORA
No, Sister.

EVANORA
I do so want to believe that.
 
42.


THEODORA
You can -- you should --

EVANORA
But how?	How can I believe you,
when you do this to me!	You know
what will happen, should this
Wizard get away!	He will ally
himself with her --

THEODORA
You don’t know that for sure.

EVANORA
But I do.	Her charms are much,
much greater than yours...
(lets that needle sink in)
... Or mine.	Just you wait --

you’ll see.


EXT. EMERALD CITY - MOMENTS LATER

THE SAVAGE HORDE ARMY STORMS OUT THE CITY GATES -- hundreds of them -- armed to the teeth -- a loping, quick-march pace -- A CADRE OF WINGED MONKEYS flying in formation above them...


EXT. ROCKY TOR - NIGHT

OZ AND KALA -- scrambling up the mountain -- and as they near the top, Kala glances back -- then points -- Oz looks, sees:

THE TORCH-LIT SAVAGE ARMY on the dark plains below -- the Winged Monkeys flying in formation above them, streaking towards us, closing in fast...

KALA
Do something!

OZ
Like what?

KALA
I don’t know -- you’re the Wizard!

OZ
Yeah, well, sorry -- I’m fresh out of miracles at the moment.

Kala studies him a beat -- then starts chugging up the hill.
 
43.


KALA
Then come-come -- keep moving --

Glinda, she will help us.

OZ
Good -- where is she?

KALA
Far from here.

OZ
Then how --?

KALA
She just will.

They crest the mountain, and as they run and slide down the far side, we pull up and back and see...

THE IMPENETRABLE MIST

A thick, spectral fog sweeping in from the south -- moving across the land like an immense ghostly hand... it envelops Oz and Kala... then the mountain... and soon the Savage Horde and the Winged Monkeys are engulfed in an Ocean of Cloud...


WITH OZ AND KALA -- IN THE IMPENETRABLE MIST Eerie, dreamlike -- Oz can’t see a thing.
OZ

Where are you?

KALA
Here, Wizard.

Oz moves towards the sound -- finds Kala --

OZ
Glinda did this?

KALA
Oh yes -- yes-yes -- I told you,

she‘s a very good Witch.

Then we see: A glow. Kala’s holding in his paw: AN IRIDESCENT ORB -- the Orb’s a Magic Compass.

KALA
Take my tail.	Follow me.
 
44.


EXT. WITH THE SAVAGE HORDE ARMY -- IN THE IMPENETRABLE MIST

Fog-blind, floundering, disoriented. THREE GENERALS are clustered together -- a GNOME, a WHIMSIE, and a GROWLEYWOG.

WHIMSIE GENERAL
It’s no use. We’ll never find him in this.

GNOME GENERAL
The Queen won’t be happy.

WHIMSIE GENERAL
Is she ever?	Nothing we can do.
(then)

You think he did this?

GNOME GENERAL
They say he came from the clouds -- now here we are in one -- I’m sure such a thing’d be easy for a Wizard like him.

The other two Generals nod, seem to agree...


EXT. WITH OZ AND KALA -- MOVING THROUGH THE IMPENETRABLE MIST

Illuminated by the Orb. As he walks, Oz plays with that GOLD COIN he pilfered, deftly rolling it through his fingers.

OZ
So:	you have a name?

KALA
My name?	My name is Kala.

OZ
Pleased to meet you, Kala.

He sticks his hand out -- and Kala hesitates -- no man’s ever wanted to shake his paw before -- and, as they do so --

OZ
I’m in your debt.

KALA
Don’t thanky-thank me yet, not till we make it safe to Glinda.

OZ
And you’re telling me she’s a Good

Witch?
 
45.


KALA
Oh yes -- yes-yes -- a very Good

Witch -- the only Good Witch left!

OZ
And Theodora...?

KALA
Quite wicked, but not all the way wicked yet, not like her sister -- no -- but soon, I think, soon-soon!

OZ
(after a moment, quietly)

She had me fooled, you know. They both did.

Kala laughs -- a real ooh-ooh-ah-ah Monkey Laugh.

KALA
Yes, yes, I know! But don’t feel bad, Wizard -- you’re not the first man-man to be blinded by a pretty face and pretty promises -- lots of men-men just as foolish as you!

OZ
Thanks -- I guess.
(then)
Tell me something:	The other

Monkeys -- can they talk too?

KALA
No-no, only me.	Thanks to Glinda.

OZ
Theodora didn’t know, did she? That you could talk -- or that you were Glinda’s spy.

Kala doesn’t have to answer, because --

KALA
Look-look -- here they are.

And Oz turns and sees, in front of them:

THE MIST MAIDENS -- beautiful, ghostly female apparitions -- they seem to be made of fog -- with flowing hair, flowing robes, flowing arms of white -- beckoning them forward...

KALA
They’ll guide us the rest of the

way -- come-come.
 
46.


Oz hesitates, then follows, the Maidens soon envelop them...


EXT. EMERALD CITY - FOLLOWING MORNING

The fog is gone -- it’s a sunny day.

EVANORA (O.S.)
So he got away...


INT. THRONE ROOM - CLOSE ON EVANORA

The Savage Generals have reported back. Evanora -- toying with the Diamond Dagger -- glances pointedly at Theodora.

EVANORA
... heading South -- straight to
Glinda, I suppose.
(to the Generals)

Leave us.

The Generals troop out.	The Sisters are alone.

EVANORA
You see now I’m right -- either your Wizard and fair Glinda have been together from the start -- or they soon shall be. Which means, my pretty, that soon you must choose... between Glinda and me.

THEODORA
You’re my Sister. How can you even think I’d choose Glinda over you?

EVANORA
Because there’s still a part of you that still wants to be like Glinda: Beautiful... and beloved... rather than hated and feared, like me.
(strokes Theodora’s hair)
But that is not who you are, dear -- not who you are meant to be... I need you, Sister -- and halfway isn’t far enough. Join me... and together we’ll defeat them -- join me, and together we shall rule for the next thousand years!
(kisses Theodora’s cheek)
And all it will cost you is your

heart.

Off Theodora’s look we bleed into a...
 
47.


MONTAGE:	THE RUMOR MILL OF OZ

Word of Oz’s escape spreads throughout the land. We see VARIOUS CITIZENS in VARIOUS PLACES, talking on the sly.

VARIOUS CITIZENS
(like a song)

Did you hear? The Wizard escaped -- he got away -- he walked through walls -- he disappeared -- he’s eight feet tall -- did you hear?


EXT. OZ AND KALA - ON THE ROAD SOUTH - MORNING

Oz stops, hands on hips, peering off.

OZ
What’s that I’m looking at?

KALA
That?	That is Quadling Country,
just on the other side.

OZ
But on the other side of what?

The reason he’s asking: Everything for the next half-mile or so looks regular and normal, clear as a bell. Beyond that, though, is what appears to be:

A SHIMMERING WALL -- extending east to west as far as Oz can see -- everything beyond it hazy as a mirage. Oz and Kala approach... Oz tentatively touches the Wall... can’t push through it -- it’s a force-field of some kind.

OZ
Glinda’s work as well, I take it.

How do we get through?

KALA
How do I know?	I’m just a Monkey.
You’re a Wizard, you do something.

Oz fumbles for a response -- and Kala laughs.

KALA
Kala just kidding!

And he smiles, raises up the Orb -- which suddenly LAUNCHES itself off his palm, shoots off into the Wall -- and when Orb and Wall meet a sparkling PORTAL appears... Kala gestures: Let’s go -- and the two pass through. The Wall closes behind them. And now they’re in:
 
48.


EXT. QUADLING COUNTRY

And Oz looks back at the Wall and marvels.

OZ
Y’know, back where I come from a
man can get pretty fizzled on the
same old usual.	But around here,
even the commonplace is really

quite extraordinary, isn’t it?

KALA
Wizard, I leave you now.
(off Oz’s surprise)
I must speak to Glinda.	You just
take-take this road here -- bring

you straight to Glinda’s Castle. You’ll be alright. Just be careful when you cross the Ripple Land.

And off he flies -- Oz shouting after him --

OZ
What’s the Ripple Land?

Kala doesn’t answer, doesn’t even look back. Oz shrugs, starts walking. And soon he’s right smack in the middle of:

EXT. THE RIPPLE LAND

Which is, as Baum describes it: ‘A succession of hills and valleys, all very steep and rocky, and they changed places constantly by rippling. While [Oz] was climbing a hill it sank down under him and became a valley, and while he was descending into a valley it rose up and carried him to the top of a hill. This was very perplexing to the traveler.’

And so it is for Oz -- and at first he has a hell of a time navigating his way across -- but eventually he makes it back to solid ground again -- and before long he finds himself in:


EXT. DAINTY CHINA COUNTRY

And as he walks he notices his shoes are making a chinking sound -- so he stops, raps that Gold Coin against the ground.

OZ
Sounds like... fine china.
 
49.


He looks around, and sees: Everything around him seems to be made of fine china -- the land, the trees, the farms, the horses and pigs and cows -- they’re all as smooth and shiny as painted porcelain. Then he sees, near one of the barns:

A DAINTY CHINA GIRL -- teetering along the top of a fence dividing a Dainty China Chicken Coop from a Dainty China Pig Sty. The Girl looks up -- Oz gives her a jaunty wave --

And, startled, the Girl loses her balance and tumbles into the pig sty just like Dorothy did in The Movie -- the China Pigs start squealing -- Oz comes running --

OZ
Sweet Jumpin’ Jiminy -- are you

alright!

--	then he sees: THE CHINA GIRL’S LEG HAS SNAPPED CLEAN OFF. She sounds remarkably calm, albeit a bit perturbed.

DAINTY CHINA GIRL
Could you help me up, please?

He lifts her up out of the sty.

DAINTY CHINA GIRL
Now my leg?

He reaches over the fence, hands her her leg.

OZ
Is there someone I should call? A doctor, or --?

DAINTY CHINA GIRL
No, my mother has some glue inside.

OZ
I’m sorry -- I didn’t mean to

startle you, I --

DAINTY CHINA GIRL
You’re that Wizard they’ve been

talking about, aren’t you?

OZ
Afraid so.

DAINTY CHINA GIRL
You don’t look much like a Wizard

to me.

OZ
What should a Wizard look like?
 
50.


DAINTY CHINA GIRL
Don’t know -- I’ve never seen one
before.
(beat)

Thought you’d be bigger.

She starts hobbling towards the house, using her detached leg as a cane, then looks back.

DAINTY CHINA GIRL
You will help us, won’t you?

OZ
Um, sure I will. Sure. And you’re sure you’re alright?

DAINTY CHINA GIRL
I’m fine, thank you.

She’s gone -- and Oz remarks to himself --

OZ
Fine, she says.  Her leg snapped clean off her body but she’s fine. (then, to the China Pigs)
Y’know, I’m about this close to

losing my capacity for surprise?

The China Pigs don’t care. Then one of the China Chickens plops out a DAINTY CHINA EGG. Oz reaches over the fence, picks it up, flicks it with a finger: Fine china.

OZ
Simply extraordinary.

He sticks the China Egg in his pocket, walks on, while --


INT. THEODORA’S ROOM - EMERALD CITY - SAME

Theodora winds the Music Box... starts DANCING to the music... eyes closed... alone... remembering... then she startles, seeing: Evanora’s come into the room.

EVANORA
Just thought you should know: Your Wizard is now in Quadling Country.
(heads back out)
Where, no doubt, he’ll soon be

dancing with fair Glinda.

She’s gone -- Theodora’s cheeks scald red.
 
51.


EXT. THE HAMMERHEAD HILLS

Oz approaches a narrow mountain pass -- whistling to himself, rolling that Gold Coin through his fingers -- then he hears:

HAMMERHEAD (O.S.)
Stop right there.

Seeing: THE HAMMERHEADS -- three very short, squat, surly-looking characters with flat-topped heads and no arms -- blocking the road in front of him. One snarls:

HAMMERHEAD
Who are you?

OZ
Name’s Oz.

HAMMERHEAD
Sure it is --

HAMMERHEAD #2
I’m sure.

HAMMERHEAD
Listen, you, just ‘cause our heads are flat doesn’t mean they’re empty, so if you’ve got any brains in that noggin of yours you’ll turn right around and go back the way you came! No one comes through here without our say-so --

HAMMERHEAD #3
And to you we don’t say so, to you we say no --

HAMMERHEAD #2
So be gone and don’t delay!

OZ
(sighs)

Look, fellas, much as I’d like to be neighborly and obliging, I’ve come a long way and I really don’t have time for this.
 
52.


And as he starts to push past them: Hammerhead #1’s head suddenly SHOOTS out from his body -- neck stretched like a Jack-in-the-Box -- and the flat part of his skull slams into Oz’s gut -- knocks him flying into the air -- the Second Hammerhead deftly catches Oz on the flat of his head like a soccer pro -- then he boings him into the air again -- Hammerhead #3’s turn next -- and the Hammerheads continue to volleyball Oz back and forth like a human beanbag for a while -- and all Oz can do is oof and ouch until:

KALA (O.S.)
You, boys, you stop it!

KALA swoops in for a landing.

KALA
You cease these shenanigans!

Glinda, she’s waiting for this man!

The Hammerheads stop -- Oz hits the ground with a thud -- the Hammerheads scowl, collectively --

HAMMERHEAD
What’s Glinda want with him?

KALA
Him, he is the Wizard!

And the Hammerheads’ jaws drop.

HAMMERHEAD
You’re the Wizard? Why didn’t you say so? We’ve been waiting an awfully long time for you, y’know.

OZ
You have?	Why?

HAMMERHEAD #3
So you could get us our arms back.

HAMMERHEAD
The Wicked Witch of the East, she took ‘em away -- and as long as she sits on the Emerald Throne we’ll be like this --

HAMMERHEAD #2
Can’t even pick our noses.

They all scowl again and nod.	Oz says, falteringly --
 
53.


OZ
Okay, so... I’ll speak to Glinda,

see what I can do.

HAMMERHEAD
We’re counting on you, Wizard!

OZ
You and everyone else, it seems.

-- and he sounds burdened by that -- then, to Kala:

OZ
To Glinda’s, then.

Off they go -- and soon, they come to it at last...


EXT. GLINDA’S CASTLE

White, radiant, glorious -- seems to be made of living crystal. Oz is dazzled -- Kala leads him inside.

INT. CASTLE COURTYARD

Like the Gardens of Babylon -- but not a person to be seen.

OZ
Where is everybody?

KALA
Don’t know, who were you expecting?

OZ
Guards, servants, courtiers -- this is a castle, isn’t it?

KALA
Glinda, she is a Witch -- and a

Witch-witch needs no one.

OZ
Independent-minded, is she?	I like
that in a woman.

KALA
(stops, turns)
But I’m telling you she’s not a

woman -- she’s a Witch.

OZ
How ‘bout you let me be the judge

of that?
 
54.


--	with a wolfish grin -- and Kala rolls his eyes -- they continue into the castle -- and in moments we arrive in:

INT. GLINDA’S PRIVATE CHAMBER

Very long, very high, many-windowed -- French doors leading out to a balcony -- and, as with the rest of the castle, there’s no one to be seen.

OZ
You gonna let her know we’re here?

KALA
No need!

And he points -- through the open French doors -- and Oz looks and sees, in the distance, coming towards us --

A MAGIC BUBBLE... looks like a big opalescent bubble of soap. Oz glances at Kala -- Kala just grins -- and the Bubble keeps wafting towards us, settles down onto the balcony -- the Bubble vanishes, and there she is...

GLINDA

And she is, in the words of Joseph Campbell: “The paragon of all paragons of beauty, the reply to all desire... the incarnation of the promise of perfection.” She steps into the room -- has the bearing of a Pirate Queen.

GLINDA
So.	You’re the Wizard everyone’s
talking about.	I’m Glinda.

And Oz just shakes his head -- sounds absolutely awestruck --

OZ
No... I know who you are:	You’re
Venus and Aphrodite, Ishtar and
Isis, you’re Helen and Cleopatra,
Ophelia and Juliet.	You are the
reason men write poetry.	You are

why men fight wars.

And Glinda smiles -- dryly --

GLINDA
Yes, Kala told me how fond you were of words. He also said he wasn’t sure if you really are a Wizard.

OZ
He did, did he?
 
55.


-- scowling at Kala, who nods enthusiastically --

GLINDA
So, then -- are you?

OZ
A Wizard? Guess that all depends on how you define the term. Can I turn water into wine, dross into gold? No. Nor can I make mountains tremble or part the Seven Seas. However...

He reaches towards Kala -- seems to pluck that Dainty China Egg right out of the Monkey’s ear.

OZ
I can at times Astound and Amaze.
(makes the Egg disappear)

Illusion’s my game.

GLINDA
Illusion as in:	Not real.

OZ
Madame, you cut me to the quick.

GLINDA
Evanora, I understand, wanted to do even worse than that --

OZ
That she did --

GLINDA
But you got away... which leads me to believe: Even if you’re not a Wizard, you are certainly resourceful -- and therefore, perhaps, useful.

OZ
(scowls)

What’re you getting at?

GLINDA
The Good People of Oz have been waiting for a Wizard to come and free them from Evanora’s Evil Rule. And even if you’re not that Wizard, right now you’re the only Wizard I’ve got...

She walks out onto the balcony.
 
56.


GLINDA
The only Wizard they’ve got.

Oz looks puzzled -- Glinda gestures:	Come look.


EXT. GLINDA’S CASTLE BALCONY

Oz steps out, and sees:

A SEA OF PEOPLE -- hundreds, maybe thousands of them -- streaming towards the castle from every direction.

OZ
Who in the Devil are they?

GLINDA
The Good People of the South.
They’ve come to see the Great
Wizard who’s going to lead them
against the Sisters and their

Savage Army.
