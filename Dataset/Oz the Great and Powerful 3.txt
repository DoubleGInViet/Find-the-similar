Oz gapes at her -- then stares out at the in-coming flood -- and they’re coming from different cities, different clans, different tribes -- we go in closer and see:

CUTTENCLIP SOLDIERS -- who, from the front, look very impressive -- marching smartly, rifles on their shoulders, dressed like Beefeater Guards... HAMMERHEADS, whom we’ve already met... DAINTY CHINA SOLDIERS AND FARMERS -- their glazed china clothes and bodies shining in the sun... A PHALANX OF FUDDLES -- fairly normal-looking people except for the thick haphazard puzzle-piece lines on their faces and bodies and clothes...and lastly: THE STERLING INHABITANTS OF UTENSIA -- who are walking kitchen utensils: KNIVES and FORKS and CLEAVERS and SCISSORS and SPOONS -- all with eyes and arms and legs -- the Scissors en pointe like ballerinas --

And when the Good People of the South look up and see Oz, a TREMENDOUS CHEER goes up -- Oz feels obliged to wave back to hem -- says to Glinda, through a fixed smile --

OZ
All these people... they want me to lead them into battle?

GLINDA
They want the Land of Oz to be

free.
 
57.


OZ
Okay, look -- you need a Wizard, I’ll be a Wizard -- but I’m not a Warlord. What you need is someone with brains and heart and courage --

GLINDA
We need you.

OZ
Why? Why can’t you do it? Theodora told me you were the most powerful Sorceress of all.

GLINDA
But there are two Wicked Sisters, and if I try to fight them alone they might well destroy me -- and if I should die, Hope and Dreams would die here in the Land of Oz -- would die for a thousand years.
(adamant)
No -- it has to be you.

OZ
And what if I say no?

GLINDA
Then I’d be very disappointed.

OZ
You wouldn’t be the first.

GLINDA
And I would banish you forever from

Quadling Country.

OZ
Throwing me to the tender mercies
of the Wicked Sisters, you mean.
(then)

And you call yourself a Good Witch.

GLINDA
A Good Witch is still a Witch, and a Witch wants what she wants -- and I want these people to be free.

A beat -- then Oz smiles -- craftily -- like something she just said hit a chord with him.
 
58.


OZ
Back where I come from, nothing’s free -- so tell you what I’m gonna do. I’m gonna go down there and have a little look-see at what you’re giving me to work with -- then you and I are gonna have a little parlez-vous... so now, if you’ll excuse me...

He moves past her, climbs over the railing and climbs down the trellis which goes from the balcony to the ground. Glinda signals to Kala -- Kala flaps down to join Oz as --

OZ REVIEWS THE TROOPS -- Kala trailing behind him like a Master Sergeant. And to call this a Highly Irregular Army is to put it mildly. Oz first stops in front of:

THE HAMMERHEADS -- a lot more of them than there were before
--	all looking as surly as an armless gang of Dead End Kids or card-carrying members of the Lollipop Guild.

OZ
I’ve already seen these boys in
action -- a good group to have if

you get into a tussle.

The Hammerheads nod to each other -- still scowling, but satisfied -- and Oz moves on to:

THE DAINTY CHINA SOLDIERS AND FARMERS -- all as smooth and glossy and apple-cheeked as Dresden figurines.

OZ
Very pretty -- but can they fight?

Kala discreetly shakes a no.	Next up:

THE FUDDLES -- who all stiffen their spines and try to look stalwart and strong for Oz -- who can’t help but stare at the thick jigsaw lines which pattern each of their bodies and faces like scars. Their leader is named FARNSWORTH --

OZ
What happened to you people?

FARNSWORTH FUDDLE
What happened? Nothing happened -- we were born like this.

OZ
I see.
 
59.


FARNSWORTH FUDDLE
Do you?	Most people find us
rather... puzzling.

OZ
Can you fight?

FARNSWORTH FUDDLE
We love to fight, sir -- provided, of course, that nothing untoward or unexpected occurs -- you know:

Loud noises, sudden attacks -- anything that would get us frightened or surprised. The thing is, sir, we Fuddles have a tendency of sometimes falling all to pieces.

OZ
Falling all to --?

And just like that: THE FUDDLE FALLS TO PIECES -- just collapses in a jigsaw heap -- there’s part of his face here, half his shoulder there, the crook of an elbow next to that.

OZ
(absolutely flabbergasted)

Did he just --?	He did, he just...

FARNSWORTH FUDDLE (O.S.) Don’t concern yourself, sir -- I’m quite all right!

Oz looks closer: a puzzle piece of Farnsworth’s MOUTH is moving -- under another piece which features a BLINKING EYE.

FARNSWORTH FUDDLE
See? -- I’ll have myself back

together in no time.

He’s already piecing himself back together.

OZ
Does it hurt when you do that?

FARNSWORTH FUDDLE
Not at all, sir.	Coming apart at
the seams is actually quite
relaxing -- relieves a lot of

stress, as you can imagine.

Oz looks at Kala, then moves on to:
 
60.


THE CUTTENCLIP SOLDIERS -- and there seem to be thousands of them -- all almost identical in their military finery, in perfect lines and perfect rows -- and Oz sounds pleased --

OZ
Ah, here we go! Now these men look like soldiers! These men --

He’s so happy he claps one of the Soldiers on the shoulder -- and the Cuttenclip’s torso RIPS almost in two! And this so startles Oz that suddenly he SNEEZES -- and dozens of the Cuttenclips go flutter-flying back into one another as though they just got hit with a bomb-blast!

OZ
Are these men made of... paper?

KALA
Oh yes -- magic paper -- a little old lady, she makes them! -- she’s very-very jolly, very sweet --

OZ
(glaring up at Glinda)
But they’re paper!	You’re giving

me Paper Soldiers?

He moves on to the Utensils -- who look hard and honed --

OZ
Now we’re talking... yes...	I
reckon these Sterling Citizens

could kill a Savage or two!

GLINDA
No, they cannot.

OZ
Excuse me?

GLINDA
They are enchanted -- and anything enchanted cannot kill.

And this knocks Oz completely for a loop.

OZ
Can I... speak to you a moment?

And he clambers back up the trellis, heatedly gestures for Glinda to join him back in --
 
61.


INT. GLINDA’S PRIVATE CHAMBER

OZ
You’re telling me that none of

these People can kill?

GLINDA
No one born here in Oz can kill...

except Witches -- and Wizards --

OZ
And the Sisters’ Savage Army?

GLINDA
The Savages are not from here...

nor are they enchanted.

OZ
So you’re saying:	They can kill.
But the Good People of Oz --

GLINDA
Cannot.

OZ
You want me to lead an Army that

can’t kill.

GLINDA
If this were easy, we wouldn’t need a Wizard, would we?

OZ
(sly as hell)

That’s right... and, like you said, right now I’m the only Wizard you’ve got. So what I want to know is: What’s in it for me?

GLINDA
Excuse me?

--	and now Oz is in his element -- he’s seen an angle here and he’s working it --

OZ
What’d you think, you were dealing with some babe in the woods here, all dewy-eyed and wet behind the ears? No, and the way I see it: Banish me and you’ve got nothing -- they’ve got nothing -- so what I wanna know is: I do this for you, and what do I get out of it?
 
62.


GLINDA
(ice)

What do you want?

OZ
If I’m gonna risk my neck I wanna be rewarded. Which means: If, in the highly unlikely event we somehow manage to defeat the Wicked Sisters and their Savage Horde, as soon as we march into the Emerald City I wanna go straight to that room Evanora took me to and I wanna load up with all the gold and jewels and gemstones I can carry, then I wanna get out of this cockamamie country and go somewhere where Monkeys don’t fly and Witches aren’t trying to kill me and everyone else isn’t looking to me like I’m the Answer to questions that have nothing to do with me!
(then, rhapsodically)
I just wanna go where the rich people go... I wanna walk through rooms of soft carpet, I wanna sleep in beds of eiderdown, I wanna drink champagne out of cut crystal and I wanna live in a house high on a hill -- and when I pass by people on the street in my gilded carriage I want them to turn to each other and say: There goes somebody.

-- seeing it in his mind’s eye -- liking what he’s seeing.

GLINDA
Very well then. That would be a small price to pay for the freedom of my people.

OZ
Then it sounds like you and me have got ourselves a deal.

He grins, steps past her, back onto --


EXT. GLINDA’S BALCONY

Where again he looks out over the crowd again -- at their upturned faces -- seeing their hope and their faith, then --
 
63.


GLINDA
And wouldn’t it be funny... if you turned out to be the man they imagine you to be...?
(he snaps a look at her)
... The man you’ve always dreamed
of being?

He stares -- she struck a nerve -- it’s like she looked right through him -- and she smiles -- knowingly -- he looks back out at the Sea of People -- as we go --


INT. EMERALD CITY - THRONE ROOM - SAME

Evanora’s gazing into her CRYSTAL BALL -- Theodora comes in.

EVANORA
Ah.	There you are.	Come see:	I
was right.

SEEING: OZ AND GLINDA -- IN THE CRYSTAL BALL -- still out on Glinda’s Castle Balcony -- the huge crowd still below...

EVANORA
Your Wizard and Glinda are now
together.	He has chosen... soon

you must too...

She turns her gaze on Theodora -- Theodora tries to keep expression out of her face -- but still...

EVANORA
It hurts, doesn’t it -- I can see

it, yes:	it pains your heart...

-- her words like a drip-drip-drip of slow poison --

EVANORA
To know he used you... to know he
played you for a fool... he made
you believe, didn’t he? -- and do
you still?... what do you think,
that someday he’ll be coming back
for you, ask you to be his Lady
Love and Queen?
(a smile)

Don’t worry, my pretty, he will be coming back...

A flicker of hope -- but then the Diamond Dagger suddenly appears in Evanora’s hand --
 
64.


EVANORA
... But not to ask you for your hand -- he’ll be coming to chop off your head!

And Theodora -- deeply stung -- bolts from the room --


INT. THE INCREDIBLY LONG VAULTED CORRIDOR - WITH THEODORA Running -- actually seems to be fighting back tears, and --
THEODORA

No -- No!

-- hands to her face now, over her eyes -- and she stumbles --

THEODORA
Don’t!	Do not!	Stop!

She wails -- in pain -- blindly keeps moving -- staggering --


INT. THEODORA’S ROOM

She stumbles in -- one hand still across her face -- feels her way across the room to the Mirror on the Wall. She stands in front of it, removes her hand, and we see:

THEODORA -- IN THE MIRROR -- and she has been crying -- still is: a single tear leaking from each eye -- and both those tears are leaving burn-lines on her face -- smoke rising... Theodora -- breathing hard -- berating herself --

THEODORA
Stupid.	So stupid.	Serves you
right.

She dabs at her eyes, then sees: OZ’S MUSIC BOX -- and with a quick backhand swipe: SHE KNOCKS THE MUSIC BOX SMASHING TO THE FLOOR.

A MUNCHKIN MAID hears the crash, comes hurrying in. Theodora resumes staring into the Mirror, just says --

THEODORA
Get a broom.


EXT. GLINDA’S CASTLE - NIGHT

The crystal spires against a backdrop of a zillion stars.
 
65.


OZ (O.S.)
And what’s this here, to the east

of the Emerald City?


INT. GLINDA’S LIBRARY

A LAND MAP OF OZ -- spread out on a low table in front of a blazing fireplace, the room’s only light -- OZ AND GLINDA on separate chairs, shadows fluid on their faces.

GLINDA
Those are the Deadly Poppy Fields. Steer well clear of them -- they can put you to sleep forever.

OZ
Right now eternal rest doesn’t

sound too bad.

He yawns, picks up his goblet of wine -- then leans back, rubs his face -- done for the night. Glinda has to ask:

GLINDA
So what do you think?	You think
this is going to work?

OZ
C’mon, what’re you worried about? This is gonna be child’s play -- a walk in the park.
(another big yawn)

I mean, what’s the big deal? All I’ve gotta do is lead a rag-tag bunch of Irregulars who can’t fight and can’t kill against an Army of Murderous Savages who not only can fight and can kill but, I’m told, actually quite enjoy it --

GLINDA
-- Yes they do --

OZ
And if somehow, against all odds, we manage to make our way past the Heathen Horde, then all we’ll be facing are two Wicked Witches who not only have some serious magic literally at their fingertips, but who, no doubt, are eager to visit the tortures of Torquemada on my mind, body and person!
(yawns, rubs his eyes)
(MORE)
 
66.

OZ (cont'd)
Like I said:	Child’s play.	What
could be easier?

GLINDA
But that’s what a Wizard does... he does things everyone knows can’t be done.

And Oz gives her a long, long look -- he so wants to tell her the truth -- instead, he drains his goblet, returns his tired gaze to the flames -- and, almost unconsciously, he takes that Gold Coin from his pocket, rolls it through his fingers.

OZ
Y’know, back where I come from there’s a Wizard by the name of Thomas Alva Edison -- the Wizard of Menlo Park. I once traveled three hundred miles just to meet him -- even got to shake his hand.

GLINDA
Is he a Good Wizard?

OZ
No: he is a Great Wizard -- he is a man who made a difference. You know what he did? He invented the electric light... and the phonograph... and a camera that lets you take moving pictures.

GLINDA
Pictures that move...?

OZ
(eyes closing)
A prime example of good old
American Know-how and Ingenuity.
That’s all it is -- all you need...
good old American Know-how and...
Ingenuity...

He’s asleep. The Gold Coin drops to the floor. Glinda rises, takes the goblet from his hand, covers him with a blanket, places the Gold Coin back in his pocket.

GLINDA
Sleep well, Wizard.	And dream of
Victory.

DISSOLVE TO:
 
67.


INT. GLINDA’S LIBRARY - LATER THAT NIGHT

Oz suddenly wakes up -- has his Eureka Moment.

OZ
I’ve got it.

He flings off the blanket, jumps out of the chair, rummages around the room -- finds what he’s looking for:

SHEETS OF PAPER AND A QUILL-TIP PEN -- and immediately, feverishly, he gets to work -- sketching, drawing -- designing -- and off the scratching of his pen we jump to:


INT. GLINDA’S PRIVATE CHAMBER - MORNING

Glinda’s here with Kala -- as Oz bursts in, all excited, waving his sketches in the air.

OZ
I’ve got it! I know how we can beat them! What I have in mind is an historic extravaganza of Olympian proportions! Using good old American Know-How and Ingenuity, smoke and mirrors, Son et Lumiere, I intend to create an illusion of such magnificent magnificence that it will boggle the mind and bedazzle the senses! It will, in other words, send the Sisters and their Savage Army into such paroxysms of Awe and Wonder that they will flee the Emerald City like rats from a burning barn!
(then, much quieter)

And the one tiny little potential hiccup is... I have no technical expertise whatsoever and, therefore, no way of turning these renderings into reality.

GLINDA
(smiles)

Then you must speak to the Elves at Smith & Tinkers. They should be able to help you.

Kala nods -- yes-yes -- and we go --
 
68.


EXT./INT. SMITH & TINKERS WORKSHOP - DAY

Looks like Santa’s Workshop without the snow -- and the ELVES look a lot like Santa’s Helpers. Oz is here with Kala. TWO MASTER ELVES are leafing through Oz’s drawings...

MASTER ELF
Shouldn’t be a problem.	When do
you need these by?

OZ
Quick as you can.

MASTER ELF
Come back day after tomorrow. Not before lunch.

The Master Elves turn and walk away -- already discussing between themselves who’s going to be doing what.

EXT. SMITH & TINKERS WORKSHOP - MOMENTS LATER Oz looks up at the sky -- and has a thought.
OZ

That fog the other night -- you said that was Glinda’s doing? Can she do that whenever she wants?

KALA
Oh yes -- that and more.

OZ
She’s a heckuva woman, isn’t she?

KALA
(with a scowl)

But I told you, she’s not a woman.

OZ
Yeah-yeah, I know -- got it --

she’s a Witch.


IN. GLINDA’S LIBRARY - LATER THAT DAY

Oz is giving the various CLAN LEADERS their marching orders. He gestures to some of the Scissor People, and tells the very old, strangely girlish, apple-cheeked MISS CUTTENCLIP --

OZ
They’ll help you -- just tell ‘em
what to do and how to do it.

(MORE)
 
69.

OZ (cont'd)
(then, to everyone)

Any questions?

THE DAINTY CHINA MAYOR stands and gives Oz a snappy salute.

DAINTY CHINA MAYOR Begging pardon, sir. But the China People, we want to contribute -- we want to fight!

The other CHINA PEOPLE present nod in agreement. Oz gets up, comes over and SHAKES THE MAYOR’S HAND.

OZ
That’s very valiant of you -- most laudable -- and I appreciate the sentiment, believe me -- but here’s the thing...

With a quick twist of the wrist, OZ SNAPS OFF THE MAN’S ARM.

OZ
See, that’s a problem.
(hands the man his arm,
then, to the others)

Alright, let’s get to work.


MONTAGE:	THE CLANS PREPARE FOR WAR

Miss Cuttenclip and dozens of magic Scissors are cutting out hundreds of Paper Soldiers... China People are painting the Soldiers in martial colors... the Fuddles are on the Champ de Mars, in military rows, and when Farnsworth Fuddle shouts a command the Fuddles in unison all fall to pieces... the Hammerheads are practicing their head-butting skills... and Oz is overseeing everything -- seems more energized than we’ve ever seen him. END MONTAGE.


INT. GLINDA’S LIBRARY - EVENING

Oz is sitting down with Glinda and Kala.

OZ
I’m guessing you have friends inside the Emerald City -- friends you can trust.

GLINDA
We do.	How many do you need?
 
70.


OZ
However many the Elves need to set things up. Now...

GLINDA
(interrupts)

You’re enjoying this, aren’t you?

OZ
Enjoying it?

GLINDA
I can tell.

OZ
(a beat)

Can you also tell I’m terrified?

GLINDA
Of?

OZ
All of it. I mean... for the first time in my life people are counting on me -- they’re relying on me --

GLINDA
And is that so terrible?

OZ
It is if we fail.

GLINDA
We won’t.

OZ
But if we do, you said it yourself: It would mean the Death of Hope and Dreams here in the Land of Oz.

GLINDA
Then we’ll just have to make sure

that doesn’t happen, won’t we?

Another pause, then -- something that’s been bothering him --

OZ
And when we get to the Emerald
City... I was wondering... what

about Theodora?

GLINDA
What about her?
 
71.


OZ
You think there’s, well, any chance she might join us? I just thought... there’s still some good in her.

GLINDA
Yes there is -- but I’m afraid that will soon be gone.
(gently)

Theodora’s doomed. She’s tried to resist her sister and the wickedness within her for the longest time -- but that time, I think, is about to run out... and even you can’t save her.


INT. SMITH & TINKERS WORKSHOP - NEXT DAY

MASTER ELF
And on this, you’ll notice, we made a few modifications.

Oz is examining one of the completed contraptions. Kala’s here with him.

MASTER ELF
We thought if you added a few more of these -- here, here, and here -- instead of this it should look more like that, rounded instead of flat.

Oz studies the schematics -- then looks up.

OZ
You’re a genius.	A genius on par
with the Great Edison himself!

MASTER ELF
Try telling that to my wife.
(moves to next table)

Now over here we’ve got...

OZ (O.S.)
My father died a broken man...


INT. GLINDA’S LIBRARY - THAT NIGHT

FLAMES IN THE FIREPLACE.	OZ AND GLINDA -- alone.
 
72.


OZ
He was a preacher, who went from dusty town to dusty town selling dreams of a better life and a better world -- but this world and this life beat him down to next to nothing, and even as a child I promised myself that was not gonna happen to me. I might’ve come from the dirt but I always believed my future was in the stars.
(looks over at her)

And I believe that future is now -- I can feel it -- my whole life’s been leading up to this.

GLINDA
I believe that too. I believe this is your Destiny.
(beat)

And I believe in you, Wizard.

He gazes at her for quite a while, then, finally...

OZ
You know I’m not a Wizard.

Of course she does.	She reaches over, takes his hand.

GLINDA
But you are a good man -- and

sometimes that’s enough.

OZ
Glinda...

She shakes her head, tells him --

GLINDA
Get some rest. Tomorrow the future begins.


EXT. GLINDA’S CASTLE - NEXT MORNING

OZ’S ARMY is here in force -- flags and standards flapping in the breeze -- UTENSILS... HAMMERHEADS... PAPER SOLDIERS...

FUDDLES -- ready to march. DAINTY CHINA PEOPLE are here to wave their heroes off -- some of the DAINTY CHINA GIRLS so caught up in the moment they’re actually CRYING SOLID DAINTY CHINA TEARS -- which fall like pebbles to the ground -- or shatter into powder.
 
73.


KALA helps Glinda onto a pure white steed. A FOOTMAN leads a second horse to Oz -- who can’t help but notice that the horse’s coat is an ever-changing kaleidoscope of color.

OZ
What kind of horse is this?

FOOTMAN
Why it’s a Horse of a Different

Color, sir.

OZ
Of course it is.

Oz mounts, then wheels and gives his troops his best Henry V.

OZ
My friends! Back where I come from we have a saying: Ad astra per aspera -- it’s the motto of the Great State of Kansas and in Wizard-speak it means: “To the stars, through difficulties.” We also say: E Pluribus Unum: “Out of many, one.” And that is us today: One people -- one army -- and, together, we shall reach the stars! Are you with me!
(the Army roars back a
resounding YES!)
Are you with me!

A louder YES! -- then, to Glinda, under his breath --

OZ
This is your last chance to talk me out of this.

Glinda just smiles -- then shouts out to the troops:

GLINDA
TO OZ AND THE EMERALD CITY!

The Army starts to march -- the China People wave and weep and hurrah -- and we PULL BACK and UP and we go --


INT. THRONE ROOM - EVANORA’S PALACE

The Wicked Sisters are SEEING OZ’S ARMY IN THE CRYSTAL.
 
74.


EVANORA
And so they march.	Soon there will
be no more sand in the hourglass...

soon you must decide...

Theodora turns to her -- fretful -- torn -- and we go --


EXT. THE SHIMMERING WALL - MORNING

Oz‘s Army approaches the border -- everything on the other side wavy, mirage-like -- then Glinda sweeps an arm, and the SHIMMERING WALL DISAPPEARS -- Central Oz is now clear as a bell. Oz himself looks skyward.

OZ
Nice day we’re having... but I’m
told the weather around here can

change just like that.

-- snapping his fingers -- then Glinda smiles --

GLINDA
Actually it’s more like this...

And she slowly raises her arms, calling forth:


AN ENORMOUS SNOWSTORM

A WALL OF WHITE comes ROARING in out of nowhere and engulfs the whole of Oz’s Army in a HOWLING BLIZZARD --

FROM ABOVE WE SEE THE STORM spreading over them -- spreading wide -- spreading miles in every direction -- wide enough that it would be impossible to pinpoint the Army’s location -- and the strangest thing is...

WITH THE ARMY -- INSIDE THE STORM -- the weather here is... perfectly calm. It’s like they’re in the eye of a wintry hurricane -- in the middle of a parted Red Sea -- with towering clouds VORTEXING above and all around them -- a swirling ceiling, whirling walls -- but down here at ground level, there’s only the slightest breeze...

OZ
You, m’lady, are magnificent.
(then, to the troops)
Abracadabra, ad astra per aspera

and E Pluribus Unum!

And as the Army moves forward -- THE CALM EYE OF THE STORM MOVES WITH THEM...
 
75.


EVANORA (O.S.)
And still you hesitate...


INT. THRONE ROOM

THE SISTERS -- gazing into the Crystal -- seeing the Storm --

EVANORA
What’s it going to take, Sister? Do you intend to wait until they’re inside the city gates?...
(suddenly grabs Theodora
by the hair)
I cannot wait any longer!	I need
you and I need you NOW!

Theodora wrenches free -- Evanora keeps at it, keeps on her --

EVANORA
What are you so frightened of!
WHAT ARE YOU HOLDING ON TO!	He
doesn’t love you!	He will never
love you!	He is coming here to

KILL you!

Once again THE DIAMOND DAGGER magically appears in her hand -- she savagely stabs it into the table, embedding the blade in the wood.

EVANORA
The time has come -- you must ACCEPT the Evil inside of you! You must EMBRACE THE HATE!

Theodora -- eyes on the Dagger -- finally shrieks --

THEODORA
ALRIGHT!	Stop it! -- alright! --
I’ll do it...

Evanora suppresses a smile -- crooks a finger --

EVANORA
Come.


INT. GRAND DINING ROOM - EVANORA’S PALACE - MOMENTS LATER

Theodora’s seated at the table -- staring -- as Evanora DRIPS POTION from a vial on a SHINY RED APPLE -- drop by drop...

THEODORA
Will it hurt?
 
76.


EVANORA
Fleetingly. Then you’ll never feel pain again.

THEODORA
Nor love.

EVANORA
What good has love ever done you?
What good has good ever done you?
(the apple’s ready)

There now. One bite is all it takes. One bite, and the world will change forever... one bite, and you’ll be able to fly... one bite -- or Glinda will soon be seated on the Emerald Throne -- as the Wizard’s Blessed Queen...

That does it: Theodora snatches up the apple, takes a savage bite, and almost immediately it begins:

THEODORA’S TRANSFORMATION

A violent inner upheaval -- the sudden shock and pain of it flashing across her face -- she PUSHES BACK FROM THE TABLE, hand to her chest -- CONVULSING -- shrieking --

THEODORA
WHAT’S HAPPENING TO ME!

EVANORA
(soothingly)

That’s only what’s left of your heart... withering away. Soon, my pretty, you’ll feel nothing at all except... beautiful wickedness.

Theodora’s gasping, fighting for air -- face and body contorted -- she sinks to the floor -- hunched over -- folded in on herself -- face hidden -- her breathing slows, then...

THEODORA
Oh yes... yes... now I understand.

And as she lifts her face we see:	Her CHIN has lengthened...
her NOSE has hooked and grown... and HER SKIN HAS TURNED COMPLETELY GREEN -- and she has become:

THE WICKED WITCH OF THE WEST

She sees her hand -- sees the color -- feels her nose and chin -- goes to the Mirror on the Wall... gazes at herself.
 
77.


EVANORA
A simple enchantment can have you looking just the way you were... if you want.

THEODORA
No.	This is me now.

She whirls around -- lurches to the window -- flings it open -- orders the SAVAGE GENERALS waiting in the courtyard below:

THEODORA
Keep only enough of you here to
protect the Palace and the Queen.
The rest of you:	You will
exterminate the Wizard’s Army --
but leave the Wizard himself for
me!	Now go -- GO!

WHIMSIE GENERAL
But... who are you?

A beat -- then Theodora CACKLES -- proudly proclaims --

THEODORA
I AM THEODORA -- THE WICKED WITCH

OF THE WEST!

The Generals storm off, as --

THEODORA
Hurry, Wizard -- I want to dance with you again -- a different dance this time -- a wedding dance... I got married, you see -- to Wickedness -- and from now on: The bride will wear only black!


EXT. EMERALD CITY - DAY

THE SAVAGE ARMY thunders out of the city -- Gnomes, Whimsies, Growleywogs, Winged Monkeys --


EXT. THE GREAT PLAIN OF OZ

The Savages flood onto the Great Plain -- fanning out -- but then, look out, here it comes --

GLINDA’S STORM -- A ROLLING, BILLOWING WALL OF WHITE
 
78.


It SLAMS into the Savage Army -- with shrieking winds -- slashing ice and snow -- the Winged Monkeys are flung from the sky like rag dolls -- and all the Savage Army can do is hunker down right where they are -- huddled together -- soon they’re covered, mounded in snow, and --


INT. THRONE ROOM

Theodora fights to shut the window against the wind -- finally gets it closed -- wheels to face her sister --

THEODORA
Look at you -- calm as a clam.

EVANORA
A storm like this is no easy task, even for a Sorceress as powerful as Glinda. The longer it lasts...

THEODORA
-- the weaker she’ll become --

EVANORA
And when it ends we’ll get to see
what kind of a Wizard this Wizard
really is... if he’s the Wizard

everyone says he is...

THEODORA
You don’t believe, Sister?

EVANORA
I believe we shall see.


EXT. WITH OZ’S ARMY - IN THE EYE OF THE STORM - EARLY EVENING

Oz is watching Glinda closely -- and the Sisters were right:
The storm has clearly weakened her.	Oz glances at Kala.

OZ
How much further?

KALA
We’re here.

And as the wall of snow in front of us recedes we see:


A PYRAMID OF ROCKS

A jumble of boulders fifty feet high.
 
79.


OZ
The Caves are under there? How do we get in?

KALA
Magic.

--	looking to Glinda -- and she summons up the last of her strength, circles her hand in the air, and...

THE STORM WALLS START CLOSING IN ON THEM -- narrowing and lifting to form a spiralling FUNNEL overhead -- Glinda directs this snaky funnel over to the Pyramid -- to one particular HUGE BOULDER -- and THE FUNNEL PICKS IT UP AND WHISKS IT AWAY just like Dorothy’s Farmhouse, revealing:

THE MOUTH OF THE CAVES. Oz, impressed, turns to compliment Glinda, just as her eyes roll up in her head -- Oz leaps off his horse, CATCHES GLINDA AS SHE FALLS -- passed out.

THE STORM IS OVER. Night’s falling fast. Oz carries Glinda into the Caves, while --


EXT. THE GREAT PLAIN OF OZ

The Storm has ended here, too -- the Savages are digging themselves out of the snow -- a GNOME GENERAL is saying --

GNOME GENERAL
Let’s get some fires going. We’ll camp here tonight.


INT. THE CAVES

Torchlight reveals: A SUBTERRANEAN WONDERLAND -- a vast central cavern -- towering stalactites and stalagmites -- an underground river -- tunnels stretching into the darkness...

KALA
The tunnels, they go all the way
under the Impassable Desert right

into the Savage Lands.

OZ
(still holding Glinda)

So that’s how the Savages got here.

KALA
Evanora, she brought them in -- to help her fight-fight Glinda’s father. He’s the one who closed the Caves, just before he died.
 
80.


OZ
How did he die?

KALA
I thought you knew. He died saving Glinda. Evanora, she killed him.
(then)
Come-come, we find a place to lay

her down.


INT. A CHAPEL-LIKE HOLLOW IN THE CAVE WALL

Oz gently sets Glinda down inside it.

KALA
They were friends, you know -- Glinda and Evanora... and Evanora, she used that friendship, used Glinda’s goodness to trick-trick and trap her, because she knew that Glinda’s Father the King would do everything in his power to save her... and that’s when Evanora, she struck like a snake. Glinda, she saw her father die.

OZ
Killed by her friend.
(echoes Theodora)

She had no idea how wicked wickedness could be, or how easily friendship could be betrayed.
(then)
How long will she sleep?

KALA
Whatever you do, don’t try to waky-wake her with a kiss. We need you, Wizard.

OZ
(a quizzical look, then)

Let’s get everyone ready.


INT. ELSEWHERE IN THE CAVES - LATER

Sparks fly as, one by one, Scissors, Knives and Cleavers step up to hone their blades against live spinning Whetstones.

SERGEANT CLEAVER
Next! -- let’s go! -- look sharp!
 
81.


Oz passes by -- and a little further on we see: TWO HAMMERHEADS -- HARASSING A PAPER SOLDIER -- using their breaths to huff and puff him back and forth between them.

OZ
C’mon, boys, leave him alone.

The Hammerheads scowl, but stop.	Kala appears.

KALA
The Munchkins, they are here.


INT. OUTSIDE THE CAVES - THE PYRAMID OF ROCKS - NIGHT

EMERALD CITY MUNCHKINS -- Glinda and Kala’s inside guys -- are helping the Smith & Tinker Elves load their stuff onto small wagons and carts, pulled by MINIATURE HORSES. Oz and Kala are with the main MUNCHKIN, who’s named M.

OZ
We’re counting on you.

M. MUNCHKIN
And the Good People of Oz are

counting on you.

Both smile, shake hands.

OZ
See you in Emerald City.
(then --)

What’s the matter?

M. MUNCHKIN
Nothing, just... thought you’d be

bigger.

--	and this from a guy about three feet tall -- and as he climbs on his tiny horse he says --

M. MUNCHKIN
The others will be here before

first light.

The Munchkins and the Elves start out.


INT. THE CAVES - WITH GLINDA - LATER

Still asleep -- then her eyes butterfly open -- she sees Oz sitting nearby -- he’s been watching her sleep. He smiles.
 
82.


OZ
You’re awake.

GLINDA
And restored.

OZ
We’re ready whenever you are.


INT. THE CAVES - MOMENTS LATER

Oz stands with arms as extended, as those freshly-sharpened Scissors and Knives and Cleavers climb up his legs and torso and settle themselves in -- in his belt -- in his pockets -- he’s soon sheathed in steel, bristling with blades -- other honed Utensils are loading themselves onto Kala -- still others are stepping into a rucksack -- which Oz loops over his shoulders -- then he looks to Glinda --

OZ
Let’s do it.


EXT. OUTSIDE THE CAVES - THE PYRAMID OF ROCKS

GLINDA
Step closer.

Oz does -- Glinda makes a little motion with her hand -- and the two of them are enveloped by THE MAGIC BUBBLE --

OZ -- INSIDE THE BUBBLE -- marveling -- excited --

OZ
Sure beats a broomstick doesn’t it?

THE MAGIC BUBBLE AND KALA FLY OFF, to --


EXT. THE GREAT PLAIN OF OZ - NIGHT

OVERLOOKING THE ENEMY ENCAMPMENT. The Savage Army is asleep: a grunting, snoring, wheezing, scratching, mumbling sleep. Then we see, coming out of the night sky to the south:

THE MAGIC BUBBLE -- AND KALA. They land on the ridge overlooking the encampment, then head down the hill with Kala and the Knives and Scissors and Cleavers --

INTO THE ENEMY ENCAMPMENT -- where quickly, quietly, the Utensils climb off Oz and Kala and out of the rucksack, and they all get to work CLIPPING AND CHOPPING OFF THE GNOMES’ BEARDS -- AND SLICING THE MASKS OFF THE WHIMSIE WARRIORS.
 
83.


And we get our first look at the Whimsies real heads -- and they really are just appallingly, embarrassingly small. Oz and Glinda and Kala keep snipping and shearing, and we --

DISSOLVE TO:


EXT. OUTSIDE THE CAVES - THE PYRAMID OF ROCKS - NIGHT

Just before dawn.	Oz and Glinda and Kala return with the
Utensils -- Mission Accomplished, safe and sound -- to find:

MUNCHKINS have arrived with MINIATURE MUNCHKIN HORSE-DRAWN HAY WAGONS AND OX CARTS. Cuttenclip Soldiers are marching out of the Cave and loading themselves onto the carts and wagons -- laying themselves flat, one on top of the other, so that hundreds can be stacked together and still only be as high as a couple of reams of paper. The Munchkin teamsters then COVER THEM UP WITH HAY. We also see:

THE FUDDLES and THE HAMMERHEADS are ready to move out together. Oz shakes Farnsworth Fuddle’s hand.

OZ
Safe journey.	Keep yourselves
together, men!
(then, to the Hammerheads)

And you boys, use your heads! Give ‘em what-for!

The Army starts out -- the Hammerheads and Fuddles heading west -- the Munchkins heading north with the hay-hidden Paper Soldiers. Then Glinda closes her eyes -- like she’s receiving a transmission of some kind -- then she smiles --

GLINDA
The Elves have made it safely into the Emerald City.

KALA
And look-look.

Behind the eastern hills:	The first glimmer of dawn.


EXT. THE GREAT PLAIN OF OZ - THE ENEMY ENCAMPMENT - SAME

And as the Savage Army starts to awaken, we start to hear... AN UNGODLY HOWLING -- a great wailing and gnashing of teeth -- as Gnomes realize they’ve been barbered -- Whimsies see they’ve been E-mask-ulated -- and they’re horrified -- beside themselves -- can’t deal -- and so --
 
84.


THEY RUN -- just go instant AWOL -- A MAD, MASS STAMPEDE -- collisions -- confusion -- Savages scattering in every direction -- as we hear a furious prolonged SCREECH and go --


INT. THRONE ROOM - EMERALD CITY - SAME

THEODORA comes running in -- now dressed head to toe in witchy black -- she heard the screech -- Evanora’s screech -- sees Evanora staring into the Crystal -- seething --

EVANORA
The Gnomes -- the Whimsies --

they’re fleeing -- they’re gone.

THEODORA
Glinda alone couldn’t have made
them do that.	The Wizard’s Army,

where are they!

EVANORA
I haven’t found them yet.

THEODORA
Soon as you do, you let me know.

-- already on her way out, and we FOLLOW HER out to --


INT. THE INCREDIBLY LONG VAULTED CORRIDOR

As she storms down the hall, she sees a Munchkin Maid, SWEEPING THE MARBLE FLOOR. Theodora snatches away the broom.

THEODORA
Give me that!	He wanted a broom?
I’ll give him a broom, and sweep

him to his doom!


EXT. OUTSIDE EVANORA’S PALACE

THEODORA comes out -- and FLIES OFF ON HER BROOMSTICK -- grim, determined, focused -- a black bolt across blue sky --

M. MUNCHKIN AND THE MASTER ELF -- hidden -- watch her from below -- then go back to their secret preparations...

EXT. ENCHANTED APPLE ORCHARD - DAY

THE HAMMERHEADS AND FUDDLES have reached their destination.
 
85.


FARNSWORTH FUDDLE
Alright, everyone, spread out, and

prepare yourselves...


INT. THRONE ROOM - EMERALD CITY

EVANORA’s watching this all on her Crystal Ball --

EVANORA
Sister.	The Enchanted Orchard...


EXT. THE GREAT PLAIN OF OZ - SAME

THEODORA has arrived to take charge of the Savage Army -- surrounded by Growleywogs and Nikko and the Winged Monkeys -- she’s telepathically communicating with her sister -- then she whirls, orders Nikko and the Monkeys --

THEODORA
To the Enchanted Orchard!	Kill
everyone you see!	Go!
(the Monkeys fly off)
The rest of you: I want a line of sharpened steel between here and the Emerald City.

The Growleywogs move out to form a Maginot Line across Central Oz. Meanwhile --


INT. THE CAVES - SAME

GLINDA frowns -- she senses -- knows --

GLINDA
The Winged Monkeys are on their way to the Orchard.

Oz nods -- exhales -- here we go -- D-Day’s about to begin...


EXT. ENCHANTED ORCHARD - DAY

SEEING: THE WINGED MONKEYS -- IN-COMING -- a dark cloud against the sky like a murder of evil crows.

FARNSWORTH FUDDLE
Brace yourselves, men!	Hold firm
and wait until they land!

THE FUDDLES straighten their shoulders, stiffen their spines.
There’s no sign of the Hammerheads.
 
86.


NIKKO AND THE WINGED MONKEYS SWOOP IN -- hit the ground running -- drawing short swords from their belts -- and with horrific simian shrieks they come charging at:

THE FUDDLES -- WHO IMMEDIATELY ALL FALL TO PIECES -- every man-jack among them just fragments and collapses, and --

THE WINGED MONKEYS ARE CONFUSED -- their primitive little brains weren’t expecting this -- and they warily come forward and start pawing through the puzzle piles -- inspect them with ignorant frowns -- and then, now that all the Monkeys are here on the ground --

THE HAMMERHEADS ATTACK -- spring out from behind the trees and start jackhammering the Monkeys with their Jack-in-the-Box heads -- ping-ponging the primates between them -- the FUDDLES QUICKLY RE-ASSEMBLE AND JOIN THE FIGHT, and --

THE HAMMERHEADS AND FUDDLES LAUNCH THE MONKEYS INTO THE TREES
--	high up into the branches, snapping off leaves and twigs and apples -- and the Trees don’t like that one bit, and they start WHALING ON THE WINGED MONKEYS -- limbs and branches just hammering the hell out of them, and soon --

THE MONKEYS ARE FINISHED -- every one of them TKO’ed. The Fuddles tie the Monkeys up. Victory is theirs.


INT. THE CAVES - SAME

GLINDA suddenly starts SMILING -- Oz sees it, and knows --

OZ
They did it?
(off her nod)

Now the Cuttenclips -- if they make it through.

Her smile fades -- she shares his concern -- and we go --


EXT. ON SEVERAL DIFFERENT ROADS IN CENTRAL OZ - DAY

IN A QUICK MONTAGE WE SEE: MUNCHKIN WAGONS AND CARTS -- getting STOPPED by Growleywog Warriors. Some of the wagons are just waved on through -- others receive a rudimentary SEARCH -- which entails nothing more than a Growleywog jabbing his spear in the straw. Then they wave the Munchkins on, and we END MONTAGE and go:
 
87.


EXT. THE POPPY FIELDS - AFTERNOON

And it is a Sea of Scarlet Poppies -- poppies whose odor is, according to Baum, ‘so powerful that anyone who breathes it falls asleep, and if the sleeper is not carried away from the scent of the flowers he sleeps on and on forever.’

THE MUNCHKIN TEAMSTERS have halted a safe distance from the fields, remove the hay and straw from the carts. THE CUTTENCLIP PAPER SOLDIERS PEEL THEMSELVES OFF ONE ANOTHER AND DISEMBARK -- some of them sporting the rips and tears they received from the points of probing Growleywog spears. THE PAPER SOLDIERS MARCH INTO POSITION -- form into rows in front of the rolling red fields -- mightily impressive, and --


INT. THRONE ROOM - SAME

EVANORA sees this on her Crystal Ball, says --

EVANORA
Sister...


EXT. THE GREAT PLAIN OF OZ

THEODORA cocks an ear -- receives Evanora’s silent message -- shouts to the Growleywog Warriors nearby --

THEODORA
To the Poppy Fields!	Follow me!

She hops on her broomstick -- takes off -- shoots down the line of Warriors -- spreading the word --


INT. THE CAVES

GLINDA’s seeing this in her mind’s eye -- tells Oz --

GLINDA
Theodora and her Warriors are

heading for the Poppy Fields.

OZ
Please don’t let there be a wind -- not yet --

GLINDA
I won’t.

Oz glances at Kala -- who’s quiet, worried -- clearly
whatever’s about to happen is crucial to Oz’s plan...
 
88.


EXT. THE POPPY FIELDS - AFTERNOON

FROM THE PAPER SOLDIERS’ POV: First they see THEODORA on her broomstick -- a black onrushing dot in the sky -- then the loping ARMY OF GROWLEYWOGS, spear-tips flashing in the sun.

FROM THE GROWLEYWOGS’ POV: A countless number of blue-jacketed Cuttenclips in front of the red, red fields.

THEODORA
Just remember they can’t kill you. Now water those pretty red flowers -- with pretty red blood.

THE GROWLEYWOG GENERAL turns, raises his spear, lets out some guttural war-cry, snaps his spear down -- and THE GROWLEYWOGS LET FLY WITH A THOUSAND ARROWS.

THE CUTTENCLIP SOLDIERS look up -- see this arrow-storm sizzling towards them -- the Cuttenclips stand their ground -- and the arrows pass right through them -- not a single soldier falls, and --

THEODORA’s stunned -- What just happened? -- and --


INT. THE CAVES - CLOSE ON GLINDA

GLINDA
(eyes closed)

Now...

And she puffs out her cheeks and BLOWS, and --


EXT. THE POPPY FIELDS - ON THE CUTTENCLIP SOLDIERS

A SUDDEN WIND SWEEPS IN AND BLOWS THE CUTTENCLIP SOLDIERS BACK INTO THE POPPIES -- so it looks like they’re retreating

--	and the GROWLEYWOG WARRIORS GO CHARGING UP THE HILL -- war-whooping like banshees -- a sound to freeze the blood, and --

DEEPER IN THE POPPY FIELDS -- Glinda’s wind keeps fluttering the Cuttenclips farther into the flowers -- and THEODORA senses something’s wrong -- and shrieks --

THEODORA
NO!	IT’S A TRICK!	DON’T --!

THE GROWLEYWOGS don’t listen -- blood lust high -- and in full battle cry they set upon the Cuttenclips -- STABBING and SLASHING -- RIPPING the Soldiers to shreds -- but then... the poppies start working their narcotic magic...
 
89.


THE GROWLEYWOG WARRIORS START DROPPING LIKE OPIATED FLIES -- soon every last one of them is in a deep, drugged sleep...

THEODORA can’t believe it -- for the briefest little moment we see a flicker of fear -- then her eyes narrow --

THEODORA
Deftly done, Wizard -- and Glinda too, I’m sure. But you haven’t won yet -- far from it. See you at Emerald City -- my sister and I will be waiting...

And she jets off on her broom, back to Emerald City, and --


INT. THE CAVES

GLINDA
Our turn now.

OZ
Showtime.


EXT. EMERALD CITY - THAT NIGHT

A very dark night... SAVAGE GUARDSMEN patrol the gates -- a GROWLEYWOG WARRIOR mans the ramparts above -- then he hears something, quickly wheels to his left to see:

KALA -- ZOOMING THROUGH THE AIR TOWARDS HIM -- towards us -- fist cocked and: POW! -- Kala crunches a punch into the Growleywog’s jaw, knocking him cold -- the Savage goes down in a heap, his spear clattering onto stone, and --

OTHER SAVAGE SENTRIES hear it, come racing to investigate -- see KALA -- who scampers -- on foot -- and THE SAVAGES GIVE CHASE -- and when the balustrade is clear...

THE MAGIC BUBBLE wafts in -- OZ AND GLINDA have arrived in Em City -- but before they separate, Glinda smiles --

GLINDA
Welcome to your Destiny.

And Oz is as honest as he’s ever been in his life --

OZ
I didn’t do this for Destiny.	I
did it for you.
 
90.


Then quickly, he turns and goes -- Glinda gazing after him -- then she pulls up the hood of her cloak, hiding her face in a cowl. She moves off, into the shadows, while --


INT. ELSEWHERE IN EMERALD CITY

KALA’s still leading the Guards on a helluva chase, and --


INT. A SMALL DARK CORRIDOR - INSIDE THE PALACE

GLINDA moves along the stone wall -- her hand against it -- then pauses as if she’s listening to something far beyond our hearing -- and then... SHE STEPS THROUGH THE WALL -- just walks through solid stone, into --


INT. THRONE ROOM

EVANORA’s on the Emerald Throne -- doesn’t even turn around as Glinda silently materializes behind her.

EVANORA
I’ve been expecting you.

GLINDA
Of course you have. You knew this day would come.

EVANORA
I’m sorry -- am I supposed to be frightened? -- of you or this false Wizard of yours?

GLINDA
False Wizard...?

EVANORA
Don’t tell me you believe --

GLINDA
In him?	As a matter of fact I do.

EVANORA
You always were so gullible.

GLINDA
Yes, once upon a time I even

believed in you.
 
91.


EVANORA
You believed in our friendship.
And you believed that, deep down,
there was some Good inside me...
(sneers)
You were foolish then, you’re
foolish now -- too foolish, I
think, to live.	Wouldn’t you
agree, Sister?

THEODORA (O.S.)
Definitely.

Glinda slowly turns -- and there’s Theodora.

THEODORA
So good to see you again, Glinda.

GLINDA
Don’t you look lovely.

THEODORA
Yes, don’t I -- I’m sure your Wizard would say the same -- he did tell me green’s his favorite color.

GLINDA
Then I’m sure he’ll enjoy sitting

on the Emerald Throne.

EVANORA
You mean my throne.

GLINDA
I mean my father’s throne. Oz the Great and Powerful will be sitting there by morning.

EVANORA
(cackles)

The Great and Powerful --?!

GLINDA
Just you wait -- you’ll see.

Then, just as LIGHTNING flashes from Theodora’s fingers, Glinda abruptly VANISHES INTO THIN AIR. Theodora scowls...

THEODORA
What if she’s right?	What if the
Wizard is --?
 
92.


EVANORA
--	he’s not -- as will be proved to you by morning -- for by morning he’ll be dead.

THEODORA
That’s a pity.	I wanted to kill
him slow.


INT. ELSEWHERE IN EMERALD CITY - WITH OZ

He slips around a corner -- sees, up ahead, in the shadows:
M. MUNCHKIN -- gesturing:	This way -- but then --

WINKIE GUARDSMAN (O.S.)
THERE HE IS!

Oz wheels, sees: SIX WINKIE GUARDSMEN... M. Munchkin quickly slips back into his hiding place as the Guardsmen advance on Oz -- spears raised -- the steel circle closing -- Oz sees no escape -- so, thinking fast --

OZ
There who is?

WINKIE GUARDSMAN
You, Wizard.

-- spear-points now inches from Oz, who somehow laughs --

OZ
Wizard?	Me?	I’m not the Wizard!

And the Guardsmen hesitate...

WINKIE GUARDSMAN
Yes you are -- sure you are.

OZ
How could I be? Gentlemen: Look at me! I’m just a man, and haven’t you heard? The Wizard of Oz is ten feet tall -- he breathes smoke and fire -- he is by all accounts and by any stretch of the imagination --

But that’s as far as he gets, because: SUDDENLY THE WINKIE GUARDSMEN ALL COLLAPSE TO THE FLOOR -- their bodies seem to just disappear, leaving behind a jumble of hats and cloaks and spears, then... RATS START WRIGGLING OUT FROM UNDER THE MUDDLE -- the transformed Winkie Guardsmen -- courtesy of:

GLINDA -- to whom a greatly relieved Oz says --
 
93.


OZ
Thought you’d never get here.

Come on!

M. Munchkin reappears -- Oz and Glinda follow him into the shadows, as we start to hear: THE TOLLING OF A BELL...

INT./EXT. EMERALD CITY BELL TOWER

KALA’S RINGING THE BELL -- hauling on the rope like a crazed Quasimodo -- barricaded here in this tower while, outside, the SAVAGE GUARDS TRY TO BREAK DOWN THE DOOR. And as the bell continues to loudly Ding and Dong...


EXT. THE STREETS OF EMERALD CITY

THE CITIZENS OF EM CITY come out of their houses -- wondering what all the commotion’s about, and --


INT. EMERALD CITY BELL TOWER

The SAVAGES successfully smash the door down -- Kala flies out the tower window -- safely away, and --


EXT. CENTRAL SQUARE - EMERALD CITY

THE EM CITY CITIZENS gather in the Central Square... SAVAGE PALACE GUARDS keep them well back from the Palace, and --

INT. IN A SECRET LOCATION - INSIDE EMERALD CITY

THE MASTER ELF is peering out.

OZ (O.S.)
Close the curtain.

The Elf turns, and we see: Oz -- standing inside a circle of very strange-looking CAMERA DEVICES. He says to Glinda --

OZ
Let’s begin.

Glinda gives a sharp wave of her hand, and just like that --


EXT. EMERALD CITY

All the torches in the city go out.
 
94.


INT. BEHIND THE CURTAIN - IN THE SECRET LOCATION

Glinda pulls the cowl back over her head, smiles at Oz.

GLINDA
Ad astra per aspera.

OZ
E Pluribus Unum.

Glinda heads out -- Oz says to the Master Elf --

OZ
Here we go.


EXT. CENTRAL SQUARE - THE EXTRAVAGANZA BEGINS

DRY-ICE SMOKE starts billowing in from all sides -- hugging the ground -- prompting murmurs from the crowd... then: from

UNDER THE ARCH OF TRIUMPH -- AN EXPLOSION OF SMOKE AND FIRE. And even before the smoke clears we hear -- booming, amplified -- like the Voice of God Himself...

OZ’S VOICE
DO NOT FEAR, GOOD PEOPLE OF OZ --

DO NOT FEAR...

And then, under the Arch -- we see it -- see him: A LARGER-THAN-LIFE HOLOGRAM OF OZ -- spectral, see-through --

OZ’S VOICE
IT IS I:	THE GREAT AND POWERFUL
WIZARD OF OZ!

GEYSERS OF FIRE shoot up on either side of the Hologram.

OZ’S VOICE
WHERE ARE THE WICKED SISTERS!

EVANORA (O.S.)
We are here...

EVANORA AND THEODORA -- ON THE PALACE BALCONY. Theodora flicks a hand -- the TORCHES next to them REIGNITE.

EVANORA
And we are anxious to see just how

Great and Powerful you truly are.

Theodora signals -- and the PALACE GUARDSMAN RUSH THE HOLOGRAM -- SHOOTING ARROWS and FLINGING SPEARS -- which harmlessly pass right through the Image of Oz -- and when the spears and arrows hit the floor...
 
95.


GLINDA -- in her shawl -- gestures -- AND THE SPEARS AND ARROWS TRANSFORM INTO SNAKES -- and go slithering off into the shadows... THE HOLOGRAM LAUGHS WITH SCORN.

OZ’S VOICE
WICKED SISTERS... IN YOUR
IGNOMINIOUS IGNORANCE AND HATE DID
YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT SUCH
PUSILLANIMOUS PIECES OF IMPOTENT
ARMAMENTS COULD HARM THE GREAT AND
POWERFUL OZ?

THEODORA
Perhaps you’d prefer this!

And suddenly: THERE’S FIREBALL IN HER HAND -- which she heaves at the Hologram -- the fireball EXPANDING en route so that when it hits it totally ENGULFS OZ’S IMAGE -- turning the space beneath the Arch INTO A CURTAIN OF FLAME -- the Citizens shrinking back from the light and the heat and --


BEHIND THE CURTAIN -- IN THE SECRET LOCATION

Oz motions to the Master Elf -- Cut! -- then steps up close to a single, larger camera-type device, and --


BACK IN THE CENTRAL SQUARE

When the Fireball dies out we see... Oz’s Image is gone. There’s nothing there under the Arch any longer. THE WICKED SISTERS CACKLE -- triumphant -- but only for a moment...


BEHIND THE CURTAIN

Oz signals -- the Master Elf flicks a switch, and --


BACK IN THE CENTRAL SQUARE

Another terrific BOOOOOM! of smoke and fire erupts under the
Arch -- and this time when the clouds clear we see:

OZ’S FACE -- AN ENORMOUS SPHERICAL HOLOGRAPHIC MOON FACE -- Like the face Dorothy will see when she goes to see the Wizard years from now -- and THE MOON FACE starts to grow...

gets BIGGER and BIGGER... then it starts FLOATING UP into the air... and as it rises, in a voice like rolling thunder --

OZ’S VOICE
HOW DARE YOU DOUBT ME!
 
96.


THEODORA
Doubt you? -- I DEFY you!

OZ’S VOICE
THEN WITNESS AND OBSERVE... AS I

UNLEASH THE STARS!

And then it begins... first a single streak of light zips across the sky like a meteor... then two more... then three -- zip, zip, zip... then more and more and more -- crissing and crossing, slashing the sky, then all at once --

It all stops. Theodora and Evanora exchange a look -- Was that it? -- but then... OZ’S MOON FACE CHUCKLES... then THUNDERS LOUDER THAN EVER --

OZ’S VOICE
BEHOLD!

AND THE SKY SEEMS TO EXPLODE! And, as Oz himself would probably say it, what follows is: ‘A FIREWORKS FANTASIA MORE SPECTACULAR AND STUPENDOUS THAN ANY THE WORLD HAS EVER SEEN!’ And no one in Em City has ever seen anything remotely like it

--	it’s eye-goggling and mind-boggling -- the Fourth of July times fifty -- and, as Oz had predicted --

THE PALACE GUARD SAVAGES -- terrified -- run like rats from a burning barn -- break ranks and high-tail it for the hills --

EVANORA
(shrieks to Theodora)

Do something!

THEODORA turns -- then ZAPS A STEADY STREAM OF LIGHTNING from her fingertips into Oz’s Holographic Moon Face -- and THE MOON FACE LAUGHS at her -- then BOOMS to the crowd --

OZ’S VOICE
GOOD PEOPLE OF OZ, LOOK AND SEE:

THE WEAKNESS OF WICKEDNESS!

And we can tell: All this zapping is sapping Theodora’s strength. The lightning first dims -- then fades out completely -- and she slumps against the railing.

EVANORA
Sister?
 
97.


GLINDA -- DOWN BELOW -- IN THE SHADOWS - smiles to herself -- then THRUSTS her hand up and forward -- and some great shimmering PULSE OF ENERGY flashes up to the balcony -- THE SURGE SLAMS INTO THE SISTERS -- knocks Evanora clear through the doorway -- she goes sliding on her backside along the floor -- her hair awry -- animal fear in her eyes for the very first time -- THEODORA’s still on the balcony -- on her hands and knees -- the Sisters lock eyes.

EVANORA
We must leave.

THEODORA
NO!

EVANORA
The night is his.	We leave and
there will be other nights.

THEODORA’s wavering -- then a ROMAN CANDLE slams into the Palace wall right beside her -- EXPLODES IN A SUPERNOVA OF RED, WHITE AND BLUE.

HIDDEN SMITH & TINKER ELVES FIRE MORE FIREWORKS AT THEODORA -- she’s being bombarded -- rockets and Roman Candles strafing the Palace walls -- she has to duck and cover -- snarling with rage -- shrieks towards Oz’s Moon Face --

THEODORA
THIS ISN’T OVER, WIZARD!	Mark my
words:	You will watch each other
die!

She runs into the Palace, helps her Sister to her feet -- and the two Wicked Witches beat a hasty retreat down the hall.

INT. THEODORA’S ROOM

Theodora grabs her broomstick, flings open the window. Looks back -- Evanora’s just standing there -- looks devastated.

EVANORA
Curse them -- curse them all.

THEODORA
Don’t worry, Sister, we will. All in good time.

Evanora nods -- regally walks past Theodora to the window -- raises her arms, the long folds of her sleeves spreading like wings -- then SHE TAKES OFF -- soaring like a nighthawk -- THEODORA SAILS AFTER HER -- ON HER BROOM --
 
98.


EXT. ON A SPIRE - HIGH ABOVE THE CITY

Kala sees the Wicked Sisters flying away -- has a TRUMPET looped on a strap -- he BLARES A TANTARA --


EXT. CENTRAL SQUARE

Everybody hears it. The fireworks stop. The tantara continues -- a fanfare of victory -- and THE CELEBRATION BEGINS -- like an explosion -- an outpouring of utter joy -- Kala flaps down off the spire, and --


BEHIND THE CURTAIN

Kala rushes in -- charged up -- Monkey-laughing --

KALA
We did it, Wizard -- you did it!

The Wicked Witches:	Gone-gone!

Oz beams -- Glinda steps through the curtain -- all aglow --

GLINDA
You were wonderful.

OZ
Yeah, that’s me:	The Wonderful
Wizard of Oz.

He sweeps her into his arms, is about to kiss her, when --

GLINDA
What are you doing!

OZ
I was... trying to kiss you.

GLINDA
But I’m a Witch.

OZ
Believe me, I’ve kissed worse.

GLINDA
But... my kiss would kill you.

A searching beat -- then he sets her down.

OZ
You mean... kill me kill me? --

compos mentis, kill me dead?
 
99.


She nods -- Kala does, too -- it’s true...

OZ
Not even one tiny kiss?

GLINDA
Much as I might like to, Wizard, I prefer you alive -- as do the Good People of Oz.

Her smile’s bittersweet -- Oz shakes his head.

OZ
Ain’t that a kick in the pants?

Kala nods -- yes-yes -- and we go --


EXT. EMERALD CITY - FOLLOWING DAY

A GLORIOUS CELEBRATION IS IN FULL SWING. There’s a PARADE -- MARCHING BANDS -- DANCING IN THE STREETS. And we see: THE HAMMERHEADS -- who now have their arms and hands back -- strutting along, some clasping their hands over their heads like middleweight champs, others shaking hands with everyone within reach -- including THE DAINTY CHINA MAYOR -- the one whose arm Oz snapped off -- who’s with his daughter the Dainty China Girl -- and no longer are they Dainty China -- they’ve been restored to flesh and blood, and--


EXT. CENTRAL SQUARE

A STAGE has been erected -- crowded with VIP’s -- a MUNCHKIN DIGNITARY is at the podium proclaiming --

MUNCHKIN DIGNITARY
No one who was here last night will ever forget it -- Such wizardry! Such wonder! What a whiz of a Wiz our Wizard was! So sound the bells, Ding Dong, Ding Dong, the Wicked old Witches are gone!

A CHEER goes up -- MUSIC PLAYS -- TOWER BELLS start to RING --


INT. THE ROOM OF RESPLENDENCE

Oz has stuffed his satchel full of about A GAZILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF GEMS AND JEWELS. But then... he HEARS the Bells, hears the Citizens break out in song, and he goes to the window, peeks through the curtain -- sees the Celebration -- the laughing and singing and dancing, then --
 
100.


GLINDA
Ready, Wizard?

Oz spins, startled -- didn’t hear her come in.	Then...

OZ
I’m not going.	I’m not leaving Oz.
I can’t.

Glinda holds her breath -- and waits.

OZ
If I did, you know what would

happen here.

GLINDA
The Wicked Sisters would no doubt return, and could well reclaim the Emerald Throne.

OZ
And I can’t let that happen. I won’t. The People need a Wizard and I’ll be their Wizard -- I’ll be the Wizard of Oz.

The answer Glinda had hoped for -- and expected -- she glows.

GLINDA
You’re a good man, Wizard.

OZ
Yeah:	Who knew?

GLINDA
(sweeps an arm)

Your People await you.

But Oz just shakes his head, glumly.

OZ
No. I can’t do that, either. If I go down there the Good People of Oz will see me for what I really am: A common, ordinary man.

GLINDA
Wizard, you are neither common nor ordinary.
 
101.


OZ
Nor am I a Great and Powerful Wizard -- and that’s what the People need me to be -- what they need to believe me to be... they need a Myth, not a man -- which is why I can never again let them see the real me... I’ve got to keep up the Illusion -- I’ve got to stay Behind the Curtain...

GLINDA
It will get lonely there.

OZ
I know.
(looks at her)

I’m sure you know it, too.

GLINDA
I do -- all too well.

OZ
(another moment, then)

I need a pen and some paper.


EXT. CENTRAL SQUARE - MOMENTS LATER

KALA comes out of the Palace, clutching a piece of parchment.
He marches towards the stage.


INT. EMERALD THRONE ROOM

OZ AND GLINDA are at the window, watching from behind a curtain when, suddenly: there’s A SOUND LIKE A SONIC BOOM!

EXT. CENTRAL SQUARE

Everyone stops, looks up and sees, SLASHING ACROSS THE SKY:

THEODORA AND EVANORA -- ON BROOMSTICKS -- burning broomsticks
--	trailing BLACK SMOKE -- SKYWRITING the words...

JUST YOU WAIT

THE CITIZENS exchange nervous glances, nervous murmurs -- THEODORA AND EVANORA finish -- and zoom away -- Theodora leaving behind one last wicked CACKLE... after they’re gone: Silence -- uncertainty -- then --
 
102.


ON THE STAGE -- Kala prods the Munchkin Dignitary -- who steps to the podium and cries:

MUNCHKIN DIGNITARY
Good People of Oz!	I have here a
missive from the Great Wizard
himself!	And I quote...
(reads from the parchment)
‘As your Wizard I hereby decree
that henceforth and hereafter the

Land of Oz will forever be Free!’

A GREAT CHEER -- the MUSIC and DANCING start up again, and --


INT. THRONE ROOM - BEHIND THE CURTAIN

OZ AND GLINDA gaze down at the revelers...

OZ
Tell me this isn’t a dream.

GLINDA
It’s no dream.

OZ
Good. I don’t want to wake up and find out none of this is really real -- ‘cause y’know something?
(turns and smiles)

There’s no place like Oz.


EXT. CENTRAL SQUARE

THE CELEBRATION continues -- but for us we’ve reached...
