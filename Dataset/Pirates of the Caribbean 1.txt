FADE IN:
EXT. CARIBBEAN SEA - DAY
A gray, impenetrable wall of fog. From somewhere comes the FAINT SOUND of a LITTLE GIRL'S VOICE, singing, slow tempo, almost under her breath:
Yo, ho,	YOUNG	ELIZABETH (O.S.)
yo, ho,	a pirate's life for
me. Yo,	ho, yo,	ho, it's a pirate's
life for me ... 
Suddenly a massive SHIP emerges from the grey, the Winged Victory maidenhead looming. It's a British dreadnought, the H.M.S. Dauntless. Formidable, frightening, twenty-five gun ports on the side, and rail guns to boot.
EXT. H.M.S. DAUNTLESS - FORECASTLE - DAY
ELIZABETH SWANN, strawberry blonde hair, stands at the bow rail, gazing at the sea, still singing --
ELIZABETH
...  drink up me hearties, yo, ho
... 
JOSHAMEE GIBBS, who was born old, skin a dark leather, clutches her shoulder, startling her.
GIBBS
(sotto)
Quiet, missy! Cursed pirates sail these waters. You want to call 'em down on us?
Elizabeth stares wide-eyed at him.
NORRINGTON
Mr. Gibbs.
NORRINGTON, a dashing young man, Royal Navy to the core, glares sternly at Gibbs. Standing beside him is GOVERNOR WEATHERBY SWANN, a man of obvious high station, brass buttons on his thick blue jacket. He is Elizabeth's father.
NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
That will do.
GIBBS
She was singing about pirates. Bad luck to sing about pirates, with us mired in this unnatural fog -- mark my words.
2.
NORRINGTON
Consider them marked. On your way.
GIBBS
'Aye, Lieutenant.
(as he moves off)
Bad luck to have a woman on board, too. Even a mini'ture one.
He returns to his deck-swabbing duties, surreptitiously takes a quick swig from a flask.
ELIZABETH
I think it would be rather exciting to meet a pirate.
NORRINGTON
Think again, Miss Swann. Vile and dissolute creatures, the lot of them. I intend to see to it that any man who sails under a pirate flag, or wears a pirate brand, gets what he deserves: a short drop and a sudden stop.
Elizabeth doesn't know what a 'short drop and a sudden stop' means. Gibbs helpfully mimes: a man being hung.
SWANN
Captain Norrington...  I appreciate your fervor, but I am concerned about the effect this subject will have on my daughter.
NORRINGTON
My apologies, Governor.
ELIZABETH
Actually, I find it all
fascinating.
SWANN
And that's what concerns me. Elizabeth, we will be landing in Port Royal soon, and beginning our new lives. Wouldn't it be wonderful if we comport ourselves as befits our class and station?
ELIZABETH
Yes, father.
Chastised, she turns away, to look out over the bow rail.
3.
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
(to herself)
I still think it would be exciting to meet a pirate ... 
The fog still hems in the ship; very little of the sea is visible --
--	but suddenly, a FIGURE comes into view. A young boy, WILL TURNER, floating on his back in the otherwise empty water. There is nothing to show where he came from, or how he came to be there.
ELIZABETH (CONT'D) Look! A boy! There's a boy in the water!
Norrington and Swann spot him --
NORRINGTON
Man overboard!
ELIZABETH
Boy overboard!
NORRINGTON
Fetch a hook -- haul him out of
there!
Quick movement and activity on deck. Sailors use a boathook to snag the boy when he passes. Norrington and Swann haul him aboard, and lay him on the deck. Elizabeth sidles in for a closer look.
NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
He's still breathing.
SWANN
Where did he come from?
GIBBS
Mary mother of God ... 
Attention is turned away from the boy --
The sea is no longer empty. WRECKAGE from a ship litters the water ...  along with the bodies of its crew. What is left of the ship's hull BURNS, a ragged British flag hanging limply from the stern.
The H.M.S. Dauntless slips silently through it all. The scene calls for hushed voices.
4.
SWANN
What happened here?
NORRINGTON
An explosion in the powder
magazine. Merchant vessels run
heavily armed.
GIBBS
Lot of good it did them ... 
(off Swann's look)
Everyone's thinking it! I'm just
saying it! Pirates!
SWANN
There is no proof of that. It could have been an accident. Captain, these men were my protection. If there is even the slightest chance one of those poor devils is still alive, we cannot abandon them!
NORRINGTON
Of course not.
(to a sailor)
Rouse the Captain, immediately.
(to the crew)
Come about and strike the sails! Unlash the boats! Gunnery crew ...  jackets off the cannons!
(to Swann)
Hope for the best... prepare for the worst.
(to two sailors)
Move the boy aft. We'll need the
deck clear.
They lift the boy. Swann pulls Elizabeth away from the rail, away from the hideous scene in the water.
SWANN
Elizabeth, I want you to accompany the boy. He's in your charge now. You'll watch over him?
Elizabeth nods gravely. Swann hurries away to help unstow the longboat. The sailors lay the boy gently on the poop deck, behind the wheel, they hurry off. Elizabeth kneels down beside the boy.
His good looks are not lost on her. She reaches out, gently brushes the blond hair from his eyes --
5.
Suddenly, he grabs her wrist, awake now. Elizabeth is startled, but their eyes lock. She takes his hand in hers.
ELIZABETH
My name is Elizabeth Swann.
YOUNG WILL
Will Turner.
ELIZABETH
I'm watching over you, Will.
He clutches her hands, then slips back into unconsciousness.
His movement has opened the collar of his shirt; Elizabeth sees he wears a chain around his neck. She tugs it free, revealing --
A GOLD MEDALLION. One side is blank. She turns it over --
A SKULL gazes up at her. Vaguely Aztec in design, but to her eyes, it can mean one thing only --
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
You're a pirate.
She glances back at the crew. Sees Norrington, giving orders, moving toward her.
She looks back at Will -- comes to a quick decision. Takes the medallion from around his neck. Hides it under her coat.
Norrongton arrives.
NORRINGTON
Did he speak?
ELIZABETH
His name is Will Turner -- that's all I found out.
NORRINGTON
Very good.
Norrington hurries off. Elizabeth steals away to the stern of the ship. Examines her prize -- the gold medallion. A wisp of wind, and she looks up --
Out over the dea, moving through the fog, silent as a ghost, is a large sailing ship, a schooner --
It has BLACK SAILS.
Elizabeth stares, too frightened to move, or cry out.
6.
The ship is obscured by the fog as it passes -- but not the mizzen-top ...  and there hangs the frightening skull and corssbones of the Jolly Roger.
Elizabeth looks from it to the medallion -- the skull on the flag is the same as the one on the medallion.
Fog surrounds and closes in on the black ship -- except for the black flag. As Elizabeth watches, the skull appears to TURN and GRIN at her --
Elizabeth shuts her eyes tight --
EIGHT YEARS LATER
INT. GOVERNOR'S MANSION - ELIZABETH'S BEDROOM
-- and then snap open again, startled wide with fear.
But this is no longer twelve-year-old Elizabeth on the stern of the Dauntless; this is twenty-year-old Elizabeth, lying in bed in the dark.
She remains motionless (were the images we just saw a nightmare, or a jumbled childhood memory?)
Elizabeth slowly looks as far out the corner of her eyes as possible without moving. Might there be someone in the room with her, looming over her?
She turns, ready for anything. She is alone.
Elizabeth sits up, turns up the flame on an oil lamp beside the canopied bed. She carries the lamp across the room to a dressing table, sits down.
She pulls one of the small drawers all the way out, reaches into a space beneath it and removes --
The MEDALLION. She has kept it all this time. It has not lost its luster -- or its sense of menace. She gazes at it as she absently returns the draw to its place --
A BOOMING knock on the door; Elizabeth jumps up, startled, knocking over the chair.
SWANN (O.S.)
Elizabeth? Is everything all right?
Are you decent?
ELIZABETH
Yes -- yes.
7.
She puts on the medallion, throws a dressing gown on as Swann enters, carrying a large box. A uniformed maid, ESTRELLA, follows.
SWANN
Still abed at this hour? It's a
beautiful day!
Estrella pulls back the heavy curtains, revealing:
Beneath a blue sky lies the bucolic town of PORT ROYAL, built on a natural harbor. On a bluff at the mouth of the harbor stands FORT CHARLES, its stone parapets lined with cannons.
SWANN (CONT'D)
I have a gift for you.
He opens the box, and displays for her a gorgeous velvet dress. She lets out an admiring gasp.
ELIZABETH
It's -- beautiful. May I inquire as to the occasion?
SWANN
Is an occasion necessary for a
father to dote upon his daughter
with gifts?
Elizabeth happily takes it, goes behind a screened-off dressing area. Estrella follows, carrying the box.
SWANN (CONT'D)
Although ...  I did think you could wear it to the ceremony today.
ELIZABETH (O.S.)
Ceremony?
SWANN
Captain Norrington's promotion
ceremony.
Elizabeth peeks around the screen.
ELIZABETH
I knew it.
SWANN
Or, rather, Commodore Norrington
...  a fine gentleman, don't you
think?
8.
(no answer)
He fancies you, you know.
Behind the screen, Elizabeth GASPS.
SWANN (CONT'D)
Elizabeth? How's it coming?
ON ELIZABETH -- She holds her hair and the medallion (still around her neck) out of the way as the maid cinches her into a corset over her slip. Estrella has her foot in Elizabeth's back as she pulls the laces tight.
ELIZABETH
Difficult ...  to say.
SWANN (O.S.)
I'm told that dress is the very
latest fashion in London.
ELIZABETH
(holding her breath)
Women in London must have learned to not breathe.
Estrella is finished. Elizabeth takes a breath -- and winces.
A butler appears in the doorway of the room.
BUTLER
Governor? A caller is here for you.
INT. GOVERNOR'S MANSION - FOYER - DAY
The caller, dressed in rough clothing, stands in the foyer, looking very out of place, and knowing it. He holds a long presentation case. He polishes the toes of his boots on the back of his calves, but it doesn't help.
SWANN
Ah, Mr. Turner! It's good to see
you again!
The caller turns -- it is WILL TURNER. Handsome, with a watchful demeanor that gives him a weight beyond his years.
WILL
Good day, sir.
(holds out the case)
I have your order.
Swann hurries to him, opens the case. Inside is a beautiful dress sword and scabbard. Swann takes it out reverently.
9.
WILL (CONT'D)
The blade is folded steel. That's gold filigree laid into the handle. If I may --
He takes the sword from Swann, and balances it on one finger at the point where the blade meets the guard.
WILL (CONT'D)
Perfectly balanced. The tang is
nearly the full width of the blade.
SWANN
Impressive ...  very impressive.
Commodore Norrington will be
pleased, I'm sure. Do pass my
compliments on to your master.
Will's face falls. Clearly, the work is his, and he is proud of it. With practiced ease, he flips the sword around, catches it by the hilt and returns it to the case.
WILL
(bows slightly)
I shall. A craftsman is always
pleased to hear his work is
appreciated --
He stops speaking abruptly, staring past Swann --
Elizabeth stands on the stairs. Granted, the dress may be painful to wear, but holy smokes!
SWANN
Elizabeth! You look stunning!
Will tries to speak, but can't. He gives up, smiles to himself, and simply nods emphatically.
ELIZABETH
Will! It's so good to see you!
Her hand goes to the chain around her throat (the medallion is hidden in the bodice of her dress).
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
I dreamt about you last night.
Will reacts with surprise: "Really?"
SWANN
Elizabeth, this is hardly
appropriate --
10.
ELIZABETH
(ignores her father)
About the day we met. Do you
remember?
WILL
I could never forget it, Miss
Swann.
ELIZABETH
Will, how many times must I ask you to call me 'Elizabeth'?
WILL
At least once more, Miss Swann. As always.
Elizabeth is disappointed and little hurt by his responce.
SWANN
Well said! There's a boy who understands propriety. Now, we must be going.
Swann takes the case from Will, opens the door for Elizabeth.
Elizabeth straightens her back, gathers her skirts and strides past Will.
ELIZABETH
Good day, Mr. Turner.
EXT. GOVERNOR'S MANSION - DAY
Swann follows Elizabeth out the door.
WILL
Good day.
He watches as she is helped aboard a carriage by the driver.
WILL (CONT'D)
(to himself)
Elizabeth.
IN THE CARRIAGE: Swann glowers at his daughter.
SWANN
Dear, I do hope you demonstrate a bit more decorum in front of Commodore Norrington.
11.
After all, it is only through his efforts that Port Royal has become at all civilized.
EXT. PORT ROYAL - HARBOR - DAY
The skeletal remains of four pirates, still clad in buccaneer rags, hang from gallows erected on a rocky promontory. There is a fifth, unoccupied gallow, bearing a sign:
PIRATES - YE BE WARNED
The top of a billowing sail passes regally in front of them. On the landward face of the sail, apparently high in the rigging, is a man for whom the term 'swashbuckling rogue' was coined: Captain JACK SPARROW.
He gazes keen-eyed at the display as they pass. Raises a tankard in salute. Suddenly, something below catches his attention. He jumps from the rigging --
--	and that's when we see that his ship is not an imposing three-master, but just a small fishing dory with a single sail, plowing through the water -- the Jolly Mon.
And it leaks. Which is why he has the tankard: to bail.
Jack steps back to the tiller, and using a single sheet to control the sail, and the Jolly Mon comes around the promontory, the whole of Port Royal laid out before him.
The huge British dreadnaught, H.M.S. Dauntless dominates the bay. But Jack's attention is on a different ship: the H.M.S. Interceptor, a small sleek vessel with rail guns and a mortor in the middle of the main deck. It is tied up at the Navy landing, at the base of the cliffs below Fort Charles.
EXT. PORT ROYAL - DOCKS - DAY
Smoothly and with no wasted movement, Jack hauls down the sail, stows it, guides the dory alongside a dock. The HARBORMASTER, a long ledger tucked under his arm, is there to catch the line and help Jack tie up.
HARBORMASTER
If you're rolling scuppers in this tub, you're either incredibly brave or incredibly stupid.
JACK
It's remarkable how often those two traits coincide.
12.
He starts up the dock, starpping on his sword belt; besides the scabbard, it also carries a compass, pistol and small powder horn. The Harbormaster cuts him off.
HARBORMASTER
It's a shilling for the dock space, and you're going to have to give me your name.
JACK
What do you sat three shillings,
and we forget the name?
He tosses three shillings onto the ledger. The Harbormaster considers, then shuts the ledger on the coins, steps aside.
HARBORMASTER
Welcome to Port Royal, Mr. Smith.
Jack gives him a half-salute as he goes past. Looks across the water toward the Interceptor -- and smiles. Above the Interceptor, among the parapets of Fort Charles, a ceremony is underway --
EXT. FORT CHARLES - DAY
With choreographed percision, Swann removes the sword and scabbard from the presentation case, held by a uniformed Navy man. He slides the sword into the scabbard, holds it out vertically to Norrington, in full dress uniform.
Norrington grasps the scabbard above Swann's hand, and Swann lets go. Norrington draws the sword, flourishes the sword, and snaps the blade up in front of his face. Swann steps forward, pins a medal to Norrington's jacket, steps back.
Norrington nods, turns smartly and nods to his fellow officers, turns again and nods to the audience -- dignitaries, merchants, plantation owners, their families. Another flourish, and he returns the sword to its scabbard.
The silence is broken loud APPLAUSE. Backslapping from the Navy men.
In the audience, Elizabeth doesn't look so good, out beneath the hot sun. She applauds briefly, then winces. Discretely tries to adjust the corset through the material of the dress, then resumes clapping, trying to hide her discomfort.
EXT. PORT ROYAL - NAVY DOCK - DAY
Two sailors on sentry duty, MURTOGG and MULLROY, take advantage of what little shade there is on the dock. But when Jack saunters up, they are immediately on alert.
13.
MURTOGG
This dock is off-limits to
civilians.
JACK
Sorry, I didn't know.
Music drifts down from Fort Charles. Jack looks up, shields his eyes.
JACK (CONT'D)
Some sort of to-do up at the fort, eh? You two weren't invited?
MURTOGG
No ...  somone has to make sure this dock stays off-limits to civilians.
JACK
This must be some important boat.
MULLROY
Ship.
JACK
Ship.
MURTOGG
Captain Norrington's made it his
flagship.	He'll use it to hunt
down the last dregs of piracy on
the Spanish Lake.
MULLOY
Commodore.
MURTOGG
Right.	Commodore Norrington.
JACK
That's a fine goal, I'm sure ... 
But it seems to me a ship like that
--
(indicates the Dauntless)
--	makes this one here just a wee superflous.
MURTOGG
Oh, the Dauntless is the power in these waters, true enough -- but there's no ship that can match the Interceptor for speed.
14.
JACK
That so?	I've heard of one,
supposed to be fast, neigh
uncatchable ...  the Black Pearl?
Mullroy scoffs at the name.
MULLROY
There's no *real* ship as can match the Interceptor.
MURTOGG
The Black Pearl is a real ship.
MULLROY
No, it's not.
MURTOGG
Yes it is.	I've seen it.
MULLROY
You've seen it?
MURTOGG
Yes.
MULLROY
You've seen the Black Pearl?
MURTOGG
Yes.
MULLROY
You haven't seen it.
MURTOGG
Yes, I have.
MULLROY
You've seen a ship with black sails that's crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out?
MURTOGG
...  No.
MULLROY
No.
MURTOGG
But I've seen a ship with black
sails.
15.
MULLROY
Oh, and no ship that's not crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out could possibly have black sails and therefore couldn't possibly be any ship other than the Black Pearl. Is that what you're saying?
MURTOGG
...  no.
MULLROY
(turns back to Jack)
Like I said, there's no real ship as can match -- Hey!
But Jack's not there. Murtogg and Mullroy look around, spot - -
Jack standing at the wheel of the Interceptor, casually examining the mechanism.
MULLROY (CONT'D)
You!
Jack looks over in exaggeratedly innocent surprise. The sailors hurry toward the gangplank.
MULLROY (CONT'D)
Get away from there! You don't have permission to be aboard there!
Jack spreads his hands in apology.
JACK
I'm sorry. It's just such a pretty boat. Ship.
The sailors study him suspiciously.
MURTOGG
What's your name?
JACK
Smith.
MULLROY
What's your business in Port Royal, 'Mr. Smith'?
MURTOGG
And no lies!
16.
JACK
None? Very well. You rumbled me. I confess: I intend to commandeer one of these ships, pick up a crew in Tortuga, and go on the account, do a little honest pirating.
MURTOGG
I said, no lies.
MULLROY
I think he's telling the truth.
MURTOGG
He's not telling the truth.
MULLROY
He may be.
MURTOGG
If he were telling truth he
wouldn't have told us.
JACK
Unless, of course, he knew you
wouldn't believe the truth if he
told you it.
Murtogg and Mullroy consider that point --
EXT. FORT CHARLES - DAY
Elizabeth, pale and perspiring, fans herself weakly, oblivious to the music and chatter.
NORRINGTON
May I have a moment?
He extends his hand. She takes it. He walks her away from the party, toward the parapet. A rather too long of a silence as Norrington works up his courage.
NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
(a burst)
You look lovely.	Elizabeth.
Elizabeth frowns, unable to focus. Norrington mistakes her expression as disapproval.
NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
I apologize if I seem forward --
but I must speak my mind.
(working up his
confidence to do so)
17.
This promotion confirms that I have accomplished the goals I set for myself in my career. But it also casts into sharp relief that which I have not achieved. The thing all men most require: a marriage to a fine woman.
(beat)
You have become a fine woman,
Elizabeth.
ELIZABETH
I can't breathe.
NORRINGTON
(smiles)
I'm a bit nervous, myself --
Elizabeth loses her balance, stumbles away from Norrington. She reaches a hand out to the parapet to steady herself, but it slides off --
-- and then she vanishes over the wall. Gone.
ELIZABETH
Elizabeth!
EXT. PORT ROYAL - NAVY DOCKS - DAY
Jack reacts, pushes Murtogg aside to see --
Elizabeth plummets from the top of the cliff. It seems to take her a long to reach the sea --
Elizabeth hits the water, narrowly missing the sharp rocks. A wave breakes, and then she is washed out away from the cliff, struggling feebly.
AT THE FORT,
Norrington looks down --
NORRINGTON
ELIZABETH!
He leaps to the top of the parapet, prepared to dive -- a lieutenant, GILLETTE, catches his arm.
GILLETTE
The rocks, sir! It's a miracle she missed them!
Norrington shakes off his arm, looks down -- and realizes Gillette is right. He jumps down and runs --
18.
EXT. PORT ROYAL - NAVY DOCKS - DAY
Jack, Murtogg and Mullroy are still in shock from the sight.
JACK
Aren't you going to save her?
MULLROY
I can't swim.
Murtogg shakes his head -- neither does he.
JACK
(rolls his eyes)
Sailors.
Above where Elizabeth struggles in the water, Norrington and several other men pick their way down the cliffs. They are too far away to get to her in time.
Jack scowls. He has no choice -- and it pisses him off.
JACK (CONT'D)
Fine.
He pulls a pistol from his sword belt, hands it to Murtogg; then hands the belt to Mullroy.
JACK (CONT'D)
Don't lose these.
And then he dives into the water, swims toward Elizabeth.
Elizabeth struggles to keep above water, gasping for air -- then a swell rolls over her, and she is submerged --
UNDERWATER,
Elizabeth drifts down, unconscious. The current turns her, and the MEDALLION slips loose from her bodice.
The MEDALLION turns slowly, until the SKULL is fully visible. A shaft of filtered sunlight hits it, and it GLINTS --
EXT. PORT ROYAL - VARIOUS - DAY
FORT CHARLES: The British flag flies, blown from an offshore breeze. Suddenly the wind dies, and the flag goes limp.
ON THE DOCKS: Wood and metal fittings on the lines bang against masts. The wind dies, and there is silence.
19.
ON THE EDGE OF TOWN: A CARIBE WOMAN feeds clucking chikens, frowns when they all suddenly go quit ... 
IN THE VILLAGE: A weather vane moves slightly in the wind.
The wind stops, and all is still. And then ... 
...  the weather vanes TURNS, and holds steady -- the wind has picked up again, but now blows from the sea toward the land.
ON THE BEACH: an OLD SALT pulls a rope line, pauses. Turns and gazes at the sky, frowning. The mangy hound at his side starts BARKING incessantly --
ON THE DOCKS: The lines bang against the other sides of the masts, the wind far stronger now.
FORT CHARLES: the British flag flies in the opposite direction, snapping in the new onshore breeze.
EXT. PORT ROYAL - CLIFFSIDE - DAY
Norrington rushes down, intent on the climb. Beyond him, past the rocky point, far out to sea, FOG gathers --
EXT. PORT ROYAL - OCEAN - DAY
UNDERWATER: the medallion hangs below Elizabeth's unmoving form -- and then Jack is there. He wraps an arm around her and makes for the surface.
ON THE SURFACE,
Jack swims toward the dock, struggling. It is far more difficult than it should be. He stops stroking, and they submerge.
UNDERWATER: Jack realizes that it is Elizabeth's heavy velvet dress that is weighing them down. He pulls at the buttons on the back, and they give way. He skins her out of the dress, and kicks away from it.
The dress falls like a cloud into darkness --
ON THE SURFACE: Jack swims with Elizabeth, much more quickly.
AT THE DOCK,
Murtogg and Mullroy are there to help haul Elizabeth out of the water.
20.
Jack climbs up, exhausted. Elizabeth is on her back; Murtogg holds her arms above her head, pumping them. Mullroy puts his cheek to her nose and mouth.
MULLROY
Not breathing.
Murtogg looks down; it seems hopeless. Jack steps up, drawing Murtogg's knife from its sheath.
JACK
Move.
He pushes past Mullroy, kneels over Elizabeth, raises the knife -- Murtogg is shocked --
Jack slits the corset down the middle, yanks it away.
Elizabeth remains still. And then -- she coughs up water and gasps, choking on her first full breath. Jack is relieved.
MULLROY
I never would have thought of that.
JACK
Clearly, you've never been to
Singapore.
Jack flips the knife and hands it hilt-first to Murtogg -- and that's when he spots --
The MEDALLION. Jack catches it up in his hand.
JACK (CONT'D)
Where did you get this?
Before Elizabeth can answer, the BLADE of a SWORD is at Jack's THROAT -- Norrington's new ceremonial sword, in fact, looking bright and sharp.
NORRINGTON
On your feet.
It looks bad -- Jack standing over Elizabeth, most of her clothes gone. He gets to his feet. The rest of Elizabeth's erstwhile rescuers reach the scene, including Swann.
SWANN
Elizabeth!	Are you all right?
He strips off his jacket, drapes it around her.
21.
ELIZABETH
Yes -- yes, I'm fine -- Commodore Norrington, do you intend to kill my rescuer?
Norrington looks at Jack. Jack nods as best he can with a blade beneath his chin. Norrington sheathes his sword, and extends his hand.
NORRINGTON
I believe thanks are in order.
Jack takes Norrington's hand gingerly. They shake --
--	and Norrington tightens his grip, yanks Jack's arm toward him, then tears back the sleeve of Jack's shirt --
--	exposing a BRAND on Jack's inner wrist: a large 'P.'
NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
Had a brush-up with the East India Trading Company, did you ...  pirate?
The others react in shock, but the sailors are well-trained -
-	in an instant, half a dozen pistols are aimed at Jack. He stands there, still holding the corset.
NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
Keep your guns on him, men.
Gillette, fetch some irons.
Norrington notices something else -- below the 'P' brand is a tattoo: a small bird in flight across water.
NORRINGTON (CONT'D) Well, well...  Jack Sparrow, isn't it?
JACK
Captain Jack Sparrow.	If you
please.
Norrington looks out at the bay.
NORRINGTON
I don't see your ship -- Captain.
MURTOGG
He said he'd come to commandeer
one.
22.
MULLROY
(to Murtogg)
I told you he was telling the
truth.
(currying favor)
These are his, sir.
He holds out Jack's pistol and belt. Norrington takes the pistol, examines it, notes the powder horn on Jack's belt.
NORRINGTON
(to Jack)
Extra powder, but no additional
shot.
Jack shrugs. Norrington unhooks the compass from the belt, opens it. He frowns at the reading. Moves the compass this way and that, keeping it parallel to the ground.
NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
It doesn't bear true.
Jack looks away, a bit embarrassed. Norrington returns the compass to the belt. Draws the sword half from the scabbard.
NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
I half-expected it to be made of
wood.
He slides it back into the scabbard, hands it to Mullroy.
NORRINGTON (CONT'D) Taking stock: you've got a pistol with only one shot, a compass that doesn't point north ...  and no ship. You are without a doubt the worst pirate I have ever heard of.
JACK
Ah, but you have heard of me.
Gillette returns with shackles, approaches Jack.
NORRINGTON
Carefully, lieutenant.
Elizabeth steps forward. Swann's jacket slips off her. She is unconcerned, but he is intent on putting it back on her.
ELIZABETH
Commodore, I must protest. Pirate or not, this man saved my life.
23.
NORRINGTON
One good deed is not enough to
redeem a man of a lifetime of
wickedness.
Gillette snaps the manacles closed on Jack's wrists.
JACK
But it seems to be enough to
condemn him.
NORRINGTON
(smiles)
Indeed.
Now that Jack is safely chained, Norrington nods to his men. All but one stow their weapons, and two step forward --
JACK
Finally.
Lightning-quick, he snaps the corset around the hand and wrist of the man holding the pistol and yanks. The pistol sails into the water. Before anyone can react to that, Jack has the manacle chain wrapped around Elizabeth's throat.
Pistols are drawn again, but now Elizabeth serves as a shield. Norrington raises a cautioning hand to his men.
JACK (CONT'D)
(backing away, toward
land)
Commodore Norrington ...  my pistol and belt, please.
Norrington hesitates, balls his fists in frustration.
JACK (CONT'D)
Commodore!
Mullroy hands the pistol and belt to Norrington. Norrington holds them out to Jack.
JACK (CONT'D)
Elizabeth -- it is Elizabeth?
Elizabeth is more angry than frightened.
ELIZABETH
Miss Swann.
JACK
Miss Swann, if you'll be so kind?
24.
She takes the belt and pistol from Norrington -- Jack's quicker than she is, and takes the pistol from her. He jerks her around so she is facing him, belly to belly.
JACK (CONT'D)
Now, if you'll be very kind?
She figures out what he wants: put the belt on him.
ELIZABETH
(as she works)
You are despicable.
JACK
I saved your life; now you've saved mine. We're square.
Done. He turns her again, and then backs up until he bumps against the cargo gantry.
JACK (CONT'D)
Gentlemen ...  m'lady ...  you will
always remember this as the day you
almost caught Captain Jack Sparrow.
He shoves Elizabeth away, grabs a rope and pulls free a belaying pin -- a counterweight drops and Jack is lifted up to the middle of the gantry, where he grabs a second rope --
Pistols fire -- and miss. Jack swings out, out, out, away from and around the gantry.
Norrington has held his shot. With careful aim, he tracks Jack's trajectory --
Jack drops from the rope even as Norrington FIRES. His shot tears the rope --
--	as Jack plummets past one of the gantry's guy lines, he snaps the length of the manacle chain over the line and grabs hold of the far loop -- slides down the line --
--	drops to the deck of a ship. He runs, leaping to another ship, then out of sight --
NORRINGTON
On his heels!	Gillette, bring a
squad down from the fort!
(to Elizabeth)
Elizabeth, are you --
ELIZABETH
Yes, I'm all right, I'm fine! Go capture him.
25.
Norrington's taken aback by her ire, and wisely hurries away. Swann drapes his coat around Elizabeth.
SWANN
Here, dear ...  you should wear
this.
Elizabeth shivers, finding suddenly that she is cold. Glances out at the bay --
--	where a THICK FOG moves across the top of the water. She takes the jacket.
ELIZABETH
Thank you, Father ...  and let that be the last of your fashion advice, please.
But she accepts his comforting embrace.
EXT. PORT ROYAL - TOWN - ALLEY - DAY
The fog creeps through, casting an eerie twilight pall. An armed search party moves along the street. They glance down an alley --
On the far side is another search party. The men nod to each other, continue on.
A moment, and then Jack drops from his hiding place beneath the eaves of a building. He still wears the manacles.
Across the street is a shop with barn doors, a pass-thru door set in the middle. Above is a sign with a black anvil.
INT. BLACKSMITH'S FORGE - DAY
Jack slips through the door, takes a look around:
No windows. The forge is dark, lit by lanterns. Work-in-progress is scattered about: wagon wheels, wrought iron gates, pipes -- even a cannon with a crack in it. But every tool is in place; the workbench is tidy and neat.
Jack is startled by a noise: MISTER BROWN, in a blacksmith's apron, snores in the corner, cradling a bottle. Jack gives him a hard poke. Another. Brown snorts, turns away.
Satisfied, Jack sheathes his sword, takes a short-handled sledge from its place on the wall. Moves to the glowing coke furnace in the middle of the room.
26.
Slowly...  he holds his right hand over the furnace, the chain down in the embers. The chain begins to GLOW. Jack sweats, grimaces at the pain --
Moving quickly, he wraps the chain around the nose of an anvil, brings the sledge down with a fast, hard stroke on the glowing links. One SHATTERS. Jack drops the sledge, plunges his manacled hand in a bucket of water. Steam billows.
Jack pulls his hand out, flexes it. Blisters form beneath the manacle -- but his hands are free.
The SOUND of the latch on the door -- Jack dives for cover.
Will enters the forge, shuts the door behind him. Spots the drunken Mister Brown in the corner.
WILL
Right where I left you.
Something catches his eye: an empty peg on the wall. The sledge lying beside the anvil.
WILL (CONT'D)
(under his breath)
Not where I left you.
He moves casually toward the sledge. The grabs for it -- but the flat of a sword blade slaps his hand. Will jumps back.
Jack stands there, sword leveled at Will. He backs Will up, toward the door. Will glares at him.
WILL (CONT'D)
(voice low and tight)
You're the one they're hunting. The *pirate*.
Jack acknowledges it with the tip of his head ...  then frowns, regards Will.
JACK
You look familiar ...  Have I ever threatened you before?
WILL
I've made a point of avoiding
familiarity with pirates.
JACK
Ah.	Then it would be a shame to
put a black mark on your record.
So if you'll excuse me ... 
27.
Beside the door is a grindstone, a sword resting in the honing guide. Before Jack can react, Will has it in hand.
JACK (CONT'D)
Do you think this is wise, boy?
Crossing blades with a pirate?
WILL
You threatened Miss Swann.
JACK
Only a little.
In responce, Will assumes an en garde position. Jack appraises him, unhappy to see Will knows what he's doing.
Jack attacks. The two men stand in one place, trading feints, thrusts and parries with lightning speed, almost impossible to follow. Will has no trouble matching Jack.
JACK (CONT'D)
You know what you're doing, I'll
give you that ...  Excellent form ...  But how's your footwork? If I step here --
He takes a step around an imaginary circle. Will steps the other way, maintaining his relationship with Jack.
JACK (CONT'D)
Very good!	And if I step again,
you step again ... 
(continuing to step
around the circle)
And so we circle, circle, like dogs we circle ... 
They are now exactly opposite their initial positions.
JACK (CONT'D)
Ta!
Jack turns and heads for the door, now directly behind him.
Will registers with angry surprise -- and then with a vicious overhand motion, he throws his sword --
--	the sword buries itself into the door, just above the latch, barely missing Jack. Jack registers it, then pulls on the latch, but it won't move up -- the sword is in the way.
Jack rattles the latch. Tugs on the sword a few times -- it is really stuck in there. Jack mouths a curse, but when he turns back to Will, he's smiling.
28.
JACK (CONT'D)
That's a good trick. Except, once again, you are between me and the way out.
(points his sword at the
back door)
And now you have no weapon.
