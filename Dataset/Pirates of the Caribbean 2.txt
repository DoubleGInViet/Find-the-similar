Eyes on Jack, Will simply picks up a new sword from an anvil. Jack slumps in dismay -- but then he leaps forward.
Will and Jack duel. Their blades flash and ring. Suddenly, Jack swings the chain still manacled to his left hand at Will's head. Will ducks it, comes up wide-eyed.
Then Jack's chain smashes across Will's sword, disarming him.
Will quickly picks up another sword. Jack becomes aware that the entire room is filled with bladed weapons: swords, knives, boarding axes in various stages of completion.
JACK (CONT'D)
Who makes all these?
WILL
I do. And I practice with them. At least three hours a day.
JACK
You need to find yourself a girl. (Will sets his jaw)
Or maybe the reason you practice three hours a day is you've found one -- but can't get her?
A direct hit -- and Will coils even more tightly with anger.
WILL
No. I practice three hours a day so that when I meet a pirate ...  I can kill him.
He explodes: kicks a rack, causing a sword to fall into his hand; uses his foot to bring his dropped sword into the air, catches it -- and attacks Jack, both blades flashing.
Jack parries with sword and chain. Jack's chain wraps around Will's sword; Will twists the handle of his guard through a link, and stabs the sword up into the ceiling --
So Jack's manacled left arm is now suspended from the ceiling. Not good. He parries using one hand, twisting and dodging around the furnace --
29.
Jack compresses the bellows, blowing a SHOWER OF SPARKS into Will's face. Jack grabs the chain, hoists himself up, kicks with his feet, knocking Will back.
Jack uses his full weight, yanks the sword from the ceiling. Hurls a wooden mallet at Will, then a second, hitting Will on the wrist. Will drops his sword, falls down, gets up --
Jack's pistol is aimed directly between Will's eyes.
Will steps back, directly in front of the back exit. Glares, rubs his wrist gingerly.
WILL (CONT'D)
You cheated.
JACK
(smiles; what did you
expect?)
Pirate.
Jack steps forward. Will steps back, fully blocking the door.
JACK (CONT'D)
Move away.
WILL
No.
JACK
Move!
WILL
No. I can not just step aside and let you escape.
Jack cocks the pistol. Will stares back. The stand-off lasts a long moment.
JACK
You're lucky, boy -- this shot's
not meant for you.
Jack uncocks the pistol. Will is surprised, reassesses Jack - -
Suddenly, Mister Brown SLAMS his bottle against Jack's skull. Jack crumples to the ground.
The front and back doors smash open, and SAILORS fill the room. Norrington pushes forward, sees Jack on the ground.
30.
NORRINGTON
Excellent work, Mister Brown.
You've aided in the capture of a
dangerous fugitive.
BROWN
Just doing my civic duty.
Jack groans. Norrington stands over him, smiles.
NORRINGTON
I believe you will always remember this as the day Captain Jack Sparrow almost escaped.
Norrington's men haul Jack away. Will watches them go. Brown looks at his bottle -- broken.
BROWN
That ratter broke my bottle.
EXT. PORT ROYAL - NIGHT
The thick fog blankets the entire bay now, and the town. The only structure visible is Fort Charles, high on the bluff, like a tall ship sailing a sea of grey.
Above the Fort is a clear black sky sprinkled with stars. A waxing moon shines, giving both Fort and fog an eerie glow.
ANGLE - FORT CHARLES,
just below the stone parapets of the fort, visible briefly deep in the fog, like a shark fin slicing through water: the TOPMAST of a ship, BLACK SAILS billowing. Flying from the mast is a flag with white Aztec skull.
The Black Pearl has come to Port Royal.
INT. GOVERNOR'S MANSION - ELIZABETH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
A maid removes a bed warmer from the fireplace, slides it between the sheets at the end of Elizabeth's bed.
ELIZABETH
Nice and toasty.	Thank you,
Estrella.
The maid nods, exits. Elizabeth opens a book, begins reading, toying absently with the medallion chain around her neck.
The lamp flame begins to diminish. Elizabeth tries to turn it up. No good. The flame goes out, and the room is black.
31.
INT. BLACKSMITH'S FORGE - NIGHT
Will, shirtless, wearing a leather apron, heats an iron ingot at the furnace, hammers it flat -- he stops.
His attention is drawn to the window. He opens the shutter and peers out -- nothing but fog. Almost without noticing, he reaches for a broading axe hanging on the wall. Takes it down; it has a satisfying weight in his hands.
INT. CELL BLOCK - NIGHT
CLOSE ON: A mutt of a dog, holding a ring of keys in his mouth.
Three seedy-looking prisoners try to coax the dog to their cell door. One holds a loop of rope; another waggles a bone. The dog just sits and cocks his head.
PRISONER
Come here, boy ...  Want a nice,
juicy bone?
In an adjoining cell, Jack lies on a pile of straw.
JACK
You can keep doing that forever,
that dog's never going to move.
PRISONER
Excuse us if we ain't resigned ourselves to the gallows just yet.
EXT. FORT CHARLES - PARAPETS - NIGHT
A noose hangs from a gallows in the courtyard. Norrington and Swann walk along the far wall.
SWANN
Has my daughter given you an answer yet?
NORRINGTON
No.	She hasn't.
SWANN
Well, she had a very taxing day... 
Ghastly weather tonight.
NORRINGTON
Bleak.	Very bleak.
>From the distance, there is a BOOM --
32.
SWANN
What was that?
-- and then the WHISTLE of an incoming ball --
NORRINGTON
Cannon fire!
He tackles Swann as the wall of the parapet EXPLODES --
INT. CELL BLOCK - NIGHT
Jack sits up. There are more BOOMS --
JACK
I know those guns!
He peers out through the bars of the window. The other prisoners crowd around their window as well.
JACK (CONT'D)
It's the Black Pearl.
PRISONER
(frightened)
The Black Pearl? I've heard stories ...  she's been preying on ships and settlements for near ten years ...  and never leaves any survivors.
JACK
There are a lot of stories about
the Black Pearl.
EXT. PORT ROYAL - HARBOR - NIGHT
The Black Pearl still cannot be seen -- but the fog lights up around her with each boom of her guns. She's firing on both sides now, hammering both the fort and the town.
EXT. PORT ROYAL - TOWN - NIGHT
Streets, buildings, docks and ships shatter and explode beneath the onslaught. Villagers panic, run for cover, dodge flying debris as best they can. If this is not hell on earth, then it's about to be --
--	long boats emerge out of the fog, carrying ARMED PIRATES. They swarm from the boats, striking down villagers indiscriminately and setting fires.
33.
INT. BLACKSMITH'S FORGE - NIGHT
Will slips the boarding axe into his belt at the small of his back. He puts a dirk in his belt, then a second and a third. He picks up a second axe and a sword.
Will slides back the doors of the forge --
A woman runs past, chased by a ONE-ARMED PIRATE wearing a yellow bandana. Will backhands the axe square into his chest, a deadly blow. Will heads out, up the street --
EXT. FORT CHARLES - PARAPETS - NIGHT
The moon is obscured by smoke rising from the burning gallows and wooden roofs. Cannon fire continues to rain down, but the fort's own cannons return fire.
NORRINGTON
Governor! Barricade yourself in my office!
(Swann hesitates)
That's an order!
Swann turns to go -- but finds himself face-to-face with a pirate -- KOEHLER, a handsome blond man with gold earrings. Beyond Koehler, more pirates come up over the far wall. Koehler grins and raises a cutlass --
-- Norrington's sword blocks Koehler's slash.
NORRINGTON (CONT'D) They've flanked us! Men! Swords and pistols!
The battle is joined --
INT. GOVERNOR'S MANSION - ELIZABETH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Elizabeth looks out a window at the scene below: even through the fog, multiple fires are visible, and ships burn in the harbor. Shouts and cries of pain. Cannon fire ECHOES.
She notices movement directly below her window: two SHADOWY FIGURES, approaching the house -- pirates. Elizabeth bolts from her room --
INT. SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT
She reaches the railing overlooking the foyer, and cries out, just as the butler opens the door -- too late; there is a BOOM of a gun, and the butler crumples.
34.
Elizabeth ducks down in horror, peering through the balusters. The pirates scan the foyer, searching. The leader is PINTEL, a sallow-looking pirate with a bald head.
Suddenly Pintel looks up, and locks eyes with Elizabeth. How could he know she was there?
PINTEL
Up there!
The pirates rush for the stairs. Elizabeth scrabbles back into the nearest room --
INT. SITTING ROOM - NIGHT
Elizabeth shuts the door, locks it, listens as the pirates pound up the stairs --
ESTRELLA
Miss Elizabeth?
Elizabeth jumps. Estrella is right behind her, terrified.
They whisper:
ESTRELLA (CONT'D)
Are they come to kidnap you, miss? The daughter of a governor would be very valuable.
Elizabeth realizes she's right. There is the SLAM of a body against the door.
ELIZABETH
Listen, Estrella -- they haven't seen you. Hide, and first chance, run for the fort.
Estrella nods. Another SLAM at the door -- it gives a bit --
Elizabeth shoves Estrella into the corner, between a tall wardrobe and the wall. Dashes for the side door.
When the door smashes inward, it slams into the wardrobe, and the maid cannot be seen. The pirates run in -- spot the open side door, and run for it --
INT. ELIZABETH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Pintel is the first through, and gets the pan of the bed warmer in the face for his trouble -- he staggers back, holding his nose --
35.
INT. SITTING ROOM - NIGHT
Estrella breaks cover, runs for the hall, unnoticed.
INT. ELIZABETH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
--	Elizabeth swings the bed warmer at the second pirate, but he catches it by the handle -- Elizabeth can't jerk it free, so she wrenches it over -- the pan lid swings down, BANGING the second pirate -- hot coals spill on his head, sizzling.
Elizabeth dashes for the hallway stairs --
INT. SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY/FOYER - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT
The pirates burst from the bedroom -- Pintel goes for the stairs, but the second pirate vaults over the handrail --
Estrella registers the butler's body, but continues out the still-open front door at a dead run. Elizabeth follows --
The second pirate lands between Elizabeth and the front door. His face is BURNED, his hair SMOLDERS -- he reaches --
Elizabeth pulls up short, runs the other way --
Pintel, on the stairs, grabs her by the hair -- Elizabeth doesn't slow -- she spins, grabs Pintel's arm with both hands and pulls him hard, belly-first, into the cap of the newel post -- he lets go of her hair -- Elizabeth keeps going --
INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT
Elizabeth slams the double doors shut, throws the bolts. The interior shutters are closed over the windows. Above the fireplace are two crossed swords.
Elizabeth climbs on the firebox; she grabs one of the swords by the hilt and pulls -- but it won't come free. Both swords are securely attached to the wall. Damn!
A SMASH from the doors -- the pirates are relentless --
On the table is a platter with fruit, cheese and bread. Elizabeth grabs the knife from the platter --
Like any bread knife, it has a round point. Elizabeth jabs it into her palm -- it's useless as a weapon. Double damn!
The blade of a broading axe breaches the door -- the pirates will be through soon -- Elizabeth looks around --
36.
INT. FIRST FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT
The doors give way; the pirates charge through --
INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT
Empty. Elizabeth nowhere to be seen. Pintel and Smoldering Pirate search, under the table, behind draperies.
PINTEL
We know you're here, poppet. Come out and we promise we won't hurt you.
Smoldering Pirate gives him a look -- he wants to hurt her plenty. Pintel shakes his head: 'Don't worry, I'm lying.'
PINTEL (CONT'D)
We will find you, poppet ...  You've got something of ours, and it calls to us!
INT. DUMBWAITER - NIGHT
Elizabeth hides in the dumbwaiter box, wrapped around the double pulley ropes that go through the center.
PINTEL (O.S.)
The gold calls to us!
Elizabeth registers that -- she pulls out the medallion, rubs the gold with her thumb. This is their objective. Light spills into the box through gaps in the top as the door above is slide open -- Elizabeth looks up through the gaps --
Pintel leers down at her.
PINTEL (CONT'D)
Hello, poppet.
Elizabeth works the ropes to lower the box. Pintel pulls the other way; he's stronger, and the box rises. Elizabeth tries to stop it -- wraps her left forearm through the rope and lets it jam against the top of the box.
Elizabeth gasps at the pain, but the box stops. She saws at the rope with the bread knife.
Smoldering Pirate helps pull the rope, crushing Elizabeth's forearm. Tears of pain on her face, she keeps sawing --
The rope parts, and the dumbwaiter box PLUMMETS --
37.
INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
>From behind the door of the dumbwaiter comes a CRASH, and a cloud of dust. The door slides open, and Elizabeth clambers out. Her head is cut, she is streaked with dirt, and can barely stand. She leans over the table, trying to recover.
The sound of the running FOOTSTEPS gets louder ... 
ELIZABETH
Please, no ... 
Elizabeth touches the chain of the medallion ...  and a desperate idea occurs to her.
The pirates burst through the doors. Elizabeth backs away, holds the bread knife to ward them off. They come around either side of the table, stalking her --
ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
(gasps it out)
Par...  Parlay!
Pintel can't believe his ears.
PINTEL
What?
ELIZABETH
Parlay! I invoke the right of parlay! According to the Code of the Brethern, set down by the pirates Morgan and Bartholomew, you must take me to your Captain!
PINTEL
I know the code.
ELIZABETH
If an adversary demands parlay, you can do them no harm until the parlay is complete.
PINTEL
It would appear, so do you.
SMOLDERING PIRATE
To blazes with the code!
He steps forward, dirk drawn -- Pintel stops him.
38.
PINTEL
She wants to be taken to the
Captain, and she'll go without a
fuss.
He looks to Elizabeth: 'right?' Elizabeth nods.
PINTEL (CONT'D)
We must honor the code.
Smoldering Pirate concedes the point, sheaths his dirk. He grabs Elizabeth roughly by the arm --
EXT. PORT ROYAL - STREET - NIGHT
Will races along, momentarily free of the pirates. He spots the Governor's Mansion in the distance. There are FIGURES moving away from it -- Elizabeth, forced by the two pirates.
Will hurries forward --
Suddenly a PIRATE jumps out from the shadows, slashes; Will defends himself. The pirate has one arm and wears a yellow bandana. Will hesitates -- didn't he already kill this guy?
The hesitation is just enough for another PIRATE, swinging a flaming torch, to SLAM Will in the head from behind. Will crumples.
The pirate lights a second torch, hands it to One-arm; they hoot with delight and head off, setting fires as they go.
On the ground, Will doesn't move.
INT. FORT CHARLES - CELL BLOCK - NIGHT
The wall of the cells EXPLODES inward. Jack pulls himself out from under the rubble. Moonlight spills in through the gaping hole created by the cannon ball. Beyond it: freedom.
But it is centered on the other cell. The part of Jack's cell that is gone is too small for a man to slip through.
PRISONER
Praise be!
He and the other two scramble through.
PRISONER (CONT'D)
(back to Jack)
My sympathies, friend -- you've no manner of luck at all!
The three descend the rocks beyond, disappearing from view.
39.
Jack is alone. Cannon fire continues, occasional hits shaking the fort. The dog cowers under a long bench, key ring still in his mouth. Jack sighs -- resigned, he picks up the bone from the other cell, and tries coax the dog forward.
JACK
It's all right, doggie ...  come here, boy. Come here, Spot. Rover. Fido?
To his surprise, the dog crawls out from under the bench.
Jack continues to coax him closer.
The key ring is nearly within Jack's reach -- suddenly, the dog's attention goes to the door into the cell block. He BRISTLES, GROWLS. He backs away from the door, whining.
JACK (CONT'D)
What's the matter, boy?
The dog bolts, through the bars, into the cell, then out through the breached wall -- taking the keys with him.
The door to the cell block bursts open. A pair of pirates step in: KOEHLER and TWIGG.
TWIGG
This isn't the armory.
He turns to go, but Koehler has spotted Jack.
KOEHLER
(Dutch accent)
Well, well ...  Look what we have here, Twigg. It's Captain Sparrow.
TWIGG
Huh. Last time I saw you, you were all alone on a God-forsaken island, shrinking into the distance. I'd heard you'd gotten off, but I didn't believe it.
KOEHLER
Did you sprout little wings and fly away?
TWIGG
His fortunes aren't improved much.
The two laugh. Jack doesn't. He steps forward, close to the bars. This puts him in a spill of moonlight. He is tight with fury.
40.
JACK
Worry about your own fortunes. The lowest circle of hell is reserved for betrayers ...  and mutineers.
Koehler and Twigg don't like hearing that. Koehler lashes out, grabs Jack by the throat through the bars. Jack clutches the pirates wrist, looks down --
Where they enter the moonlight, Koehler's wrists and hands are skeletol.
Jack's eyes go wide -- he is holding a skeleton arm.
JACK (CONT'D)
You are cursed.
Koehler sneers, shoves Jack bakwards, hard. Now out of the moonlight, his hand is normal. Jack stares, realizing --
JACK (CONT'D)
The stories are true.
Koehler ushers Twigg toward the door. Looks back.
KOEHLER
You know nothing of hell.
And then they're gone.
EXT. PORT ROYAL - NIGHT
Amid the thunder of cannon fire, a longboat slips through the fog. Elizabeth sits in the prow. Columns of water from the cannon balls geyser up around the boat.
The fog parts. Elizabeth looks up to see --
The Black Pearl, a tall galleon, its black sails looming high above her. At the bow is an ornately carved figurehead of a beautiful woman, arm held high, a small bird taking wing from her outstretched hand.
The longboat makes for a pair of lines dangling from a winch.
EXT. BLACK PEARL - MAIN DECK - NIGHT
Lit by lanterns; no moon is visible beneath the fog. Smoke hangs heavy above the deck.
Elizabeth's longboat is raised above the deck rail -- pirates spot her, and stare.
41.
One polite fellow steps forward to offer his hand. She takes it and steps down. She huddles, self- conscious in her nightgown and dressing robe.
BOSUN
I didn't know we was taking
captives.
PINTEL
She's invoked the right of parlay
...  with Captain Barbossa.
ON THE POOP DECK -- an imposing FIGURE in silhouette stands by the wheel, too far away to have heard Pintel's words. But his head turns at the mention of his name.
The silhouetted figure moves toward the stairs. A cloud of SMOKE obscures him -- and then, as if he skipped the stairs, he strides out of the SMOKE on the main deck --
This is BARBOSSA. Despite the bright colors of clothing, definitely not a man you'd want to meet in a dark alley -- or anywhere, for that matter.
Elizabeth, more terrified than ever, cannot look away from his eyes. But she musters her courage --
ELIZABETH
I am here to --
Bosun SLAPS her.
BOSUN
You'll speak when spoken to!
His wrist is grabbed -- painfully -- by Barbossa.
BARBOSSA
And you'll not lay a hand on those under the protection of parlay!
BOSUN
Aye, sir.
Barbossa releases him. Turns to Elizabeth, smiles -- it shows both gold and silver teeth.
BARBOSSA
My apologies, miss. As you were saying, before you were so rudely interrupted?
42.
ELIZABETH
Captain Barbossa ...  I have come to negotiate the cessation of hostilities against Port Royal.
Barbossa is both impressed and amused.
BARBOSSA
There was a lot of long words in
there, miss, and we're not but
humble pirates.	What is it you
want?
ELIZABETH
I want you to leave.	And never
come back.
Barbossa and the pirates laugh.
BARBOSSA
I am disinclined to acquiesce to
your request.
(helpfully)
Means 'No.'
ELIZABETH
Very well.
She quickly slips the medallion off, darts to the side of the rail, dangles it over the side of the ship. The pirates go quiet.
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
I'll drop it!
BARBOSSA
My holds are bursting with swag.
That bit of shine matters to me ... 
Why?
ELIZABETH
Because it's what you're searching for. You've been searching for it for years. I recognize this ship. I saw it eight years ago, when we made the crossing from England.
BARBOSSA
(interested)
Did you, now?
Elizabeth glares at him. She's getting nowhere.
43.
ELIZABETH
Fine.	I suppose if this is
worthless, there's no reason to
keep it.
She flips the medallion up, off her finger --
BARBOSSA
NO!
She catches it by the chain, smiles at him triumphantly.
BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
You have a name, missy?
ELIZABETH
Elizabeth --
(stops herself from
saying "Swann"; then)
Turner.
(embroidering)
I'm a maid in the governor's
household.
(curtsies)
Barbossa reacts to the name Turner: it confirms what he has suspected. The other pirates surreptitiously exchange glances and nods.
BARBOSSA
You've got sand, for a maid.
ELIZABETH
(curtsies again)
Thank you, sir.
BARBOSSA
And how does a maid come to own a trinket such as that? A family heirloom, perhaps?
ELIZABETH
Of course.
(offended)
I didn't steal it, if that's what you mean.
BARBOSSA
No, no, nothing like that.
(comes to a decision)
Very well. You hand that over, we'll put your town to our rudder and ne'er return.
44.
ELIZABETH
Can I trust you?
BARBOSSA
It's you who invoked the parlay! Believe me, Miss, you'd best hand it over, now ...  or these be the last friendly words you'll hear!
Elizabeth hesitates, but she has no choice. She holds out the medallion. He grabs it, clutches it in his fist like hope.
ELIZABETH
Our bargain..?
Barbossa grins devilishly -- but then nods to Bosun.
BOSUN
Still the guns, and stow 'em! Signal the men, set the flags, and make good to clear port!
For the first time since the attack began, the BOOMING of the guns ceases. Elizabeth is surprised -- and relieved. The pirates hustle to follow orders. Barbossa turns away.
ELIZABETH
Wait! You must return me to shore! According to the rules of the Order of the Brethen --
Barbossa wheels on her.
BARBOSSA
First. Your return to shore was not part of our negotiations nor our agreement, and so I 'must' do nothing. Secondly: you must be a pirate for the pirate's code to apply. And you're not. And thirdly ...  the code is more what you'd call guidelines than actual rules.
(grins gold and silver)
Welcome aboard the Black Pearl,
Miss Turner.
Elizabeth stares in speechless terror --
EXT. PORT ROYAL - HARBOR - PRE-DAWN
As the Black Pearl turns out to sea, Elizabeth is led back along the deck to the captain's cabin.
45.
The fog starts to dissipate, turning to light mist; through it, the Black Pearl makes for the scarlet glow of dawn.
EXT. PORT ROYAL - STREET - PRE-DAWN
Will comes to, still where he fell, gets to his feet.
He takes in the devastation of Port Royal: the harbor is dotted with burning and sunken ships; buildings are razed and still smolder. The aftermath of hell on earth.
Will turns, and runs for the Governor's Mansion.
INT. GOVERNOR'S MANSION - MORNING
Will races past the smashed doors, into the foyer. Calls out:
WILL
Miss Swann!	Elizabeth!
A terrible silence answers him. He spots an overturned chair, fallen bookshelf --
INT. FORT CHARLES - NORRINGTON'S OFFICE - MORNING
Will bursts in, still armed with sword and boarding axe.
WILL
They've taken her!	They've taken
Elizabeth!
A group stares at him: Swann, Norrington, and Gillette among others, gathered around a map. The map is so large it drapes over the Governor's desk, the far end supported by a chair.
NORRINGTON
We're aware of the situation.
WILL
We have to hunt them down -- and
save her!
Swann's worry has made him short-tempered.
SWANN
Where do you suppose we start? If you have any information that concerns my daughter, then share it! If anyone does, tell me!
(Will is silent)
Leave, Mr. Turner.
Murtogg has remembered something. He ventures it warily:
46.
MURTOGG
That Jack Sparrow ...  he talked
about the Black Pearl.
MULLROY
Mentioned it, is more what he did.
MURTOGG
Still --
WILL
We can ask him where it is -- maybe he can lead us to it!
SWANN
That pirate tried to kill my daughter. We could never trust a word he said!
WILL
We could strike a bargain --
NORRINGTON
No. The pirates who invaded this fort left Sparrow locked in his cell. Ergo, he is not their ally, and therefore of no value.
(through with Will)
We will determine their most likely course, and launch a search mission that sails with the tide.
Will slams the boarding axe into the desk, through the map.
WILL
That's not good enough!	This is
Elizabeth's life!
Norrington is quick to react; he throws a strong arm across Will's back, and guides him roughly to the door.
NORRINGTON
Mr. Turner, this is not the time
for rash actions.
(low)
Do not make the mistake of thinking you are the only man here who loves Elizabeth.
(firm)
Now, go home.
He opens the door, and then turns away. Will watches him walk back to the desk. Will's face sets in resolve, and he leaves.
47.
INT. FORT CHARLES - JAIL CELLS - MORNING
Jack strains, trying to budge one of the bars. Even with the damage from the cannon ball, it won't move. He hears the sound of the door latch --
The door opens, and Will slips in. Looks around. Jack lounges on the floor of his cell, apparently relaxed and unconcerned. Will marches straight up to the bars.
WILL
Are you familiar with that ship?
The Black Pearl?
JACK
Somewhat.
WILL
Where does it make berth?
JACK
Surely you've heard the stories?
The Black Pearl sails from the
dreaded Isla de Mureta ...  an
island that cannot be found --
except by those who already know
where it is.
WILL
The ship's real enough.	So its
anchorage must be a real place.
Where is it?
JACK
Why ask me?
WILL
Because you're a pirate.
JACK
And you want to turn pirate
yourself?
WILL
Never.
(beat)
They took Miss Swann.
JACK
(he was right)
So it is that you found a girl.
48.
Well, if you're intending to brave all and hasten to her rescue and so win fair lady's heart, you'll have to do it alone. I see no profit in it for me.
Will slams his fist against the bars in furstration. Jack is surprised at the outburst. Will thinks ...  makes a decision.
WILL
I can get you out of here.
JACK
How?	The key's run off.
WILL
(examines his cell)
I helped build these cells. Those are hook-and-ring hinges. The proper application of strength, the door'll lift free. Just calls for the right lever and fulcrum ... 
Jack watches Will as he speaks, and it dawns on him -- Will is the spitting image of someone he's known in the past.
JACK
You're name is Turner.
Will gives him a puzzled look.
WILL
Yes.	Will Turner.
Jack grins.
JACK
Will Turner... 
(he stands)
I'll tell you what, Mr. Turner. I've changed my mind. You spring me from this cell, and on pain of death, I'll take you to the Black Pearl.
(sticks out his hand)
Do we have an accord?
Will gives him a suspicious look. The deal seems too good.
Jack keeps his hand out, still smiling. Will shakes it.
WILL
Agreed.
49.
JACK
Agreed!
Will looks around, figures out what he needs. He makes a chair his fulcrum, and levers the long bench under the door. Pushes down -- it's hard work -- but the cell door rises, and then falls forward, CRASHING down on the bench and chair.
Jack is impressed. He steps out of the cell.
WILL
Someone will have heard that.
Hurry.
Will heads for the door. Jack searches the desk, cupboards.
JACK
Not without my effects.
WILL
We need to go!
Jack finds his pistol, sword belt, and compass. Straps on the belt, checks the shot in his pistol.
WILL (CONT'D)
Why are brothering with that?
JACK
My business, Will.	As for your
business -- one question, or
there's no use going.
(joins Will at the door)
This girl -- what does she mean to you? How far are you willing to go to save her?
WILL
(no hesitation)
I'd die for her.
JACK
Good.
EXT. PORT ROYAL - DOCKS - MORNING
The Jolly Mon, four inches of water in the bottom, squats low in the water, heeled to one side, creeking on its lines.
JACK (O.S.)
Ah, now there's a lovely sight!
Jack hops down into the boat. Prepares to make way.
50.
JACK (CONT'D)
I knew the Harbormaster wouldn't report her. Honest men are slaves to their conscience, and there's no predicting 'em. But you can always trust a dishonest man to stay that way... 
Jack notices that Will is standing, frozen on the dock, staring at the boat in dismay.
JACK (CONT'D)
Come aboard.
WILL
I haven't set foot off dry land since I was twelve, when the ship I was on exploded.
(regards the boat)
It's been a sound policy.
JACK
No worries there. She's far more likely to rot out from under us.
Will steels himself, steps into the boat as if it's going to capsize with the slightest movement. Jack hoists the sail.
JACK (CONT'D)
Besides, we are about to better our prospects considerably.
He nods toward the H.M.S. Dauntless, looming in the harbor.
Will whiteknuckles the gunwales.
WILL
We're going to steal a ship? That ship?
JACK
Commandeer.	We're going to
commandeer a ship.	Nautical term.
WILL
It's still against the law.
JACK
So's breaking a man out of jail. Face it, Will: you may say you'll never be a pirate, but you're off to a rip-roaring start.
(smiling)
My advice -- smile and enjoy it.
51.
EXT. PORT ROYAL - MORNING
The Jolly Mon bobs its way across the bay, dwarfed against the H.M.S. Dauntless. Will holds a stay line with iron fists.
WILL
This is either crazy, or brilliant.
JACK
Remarkable how often those two
traits coincide.
The Jolly Mon nears the rudder of the much larger ship --
EXT. H.M.S. DAUNTLESS - MAIN DECK - MORNING
There's been a breakdown in discipline; about a dozen Navy sailors are gathered together on the main deck, playing dice. Murtogg and Mullroy among them.
Suddenly, Jack and Will jump out, into the open -- brandishing pistols.
JACK
Everybody stay calm. We're taking over the ship!
WILL
(a beat)
Aye!	Avast!
Jack gives him a look, shakes his hand: don't do that.
The sailors all look at them -- and then burst out LAUGHING. They grin, shake their heads. Jack stands there, grinning with them -- but his gun is still level. The Lieutenant, GILLETTE, steps forward.
GILLETTE
You're serious about this.
Jack moves his pistol across, points it at Gillette.
JACK
Dead serious.
GILLETTE
You understand this ship cannot be crewed by only two men. You'll never make it out of the bay.
JACK
We'll see about that.
52.
More guffaws from the crew. A couple sailors more forward, hands on swords -- Gillette holds up a hand.
GILLETTE
Sir, I'll not see any of my men killed or wounded in this foolish enterprise.
JACK
Fine by me. We brought you a nice little boat, so you can all get back to shore, safe and sound.
GILLETTE
(a curt nod)
Agreed. You have the momentary advantage, sir. But I will see you smile from the yard arm, sir.
JACK
As likely as not.
(calling)
Will, short up the anchor, we've
got ourselves a ship!
EXT. DAUNTLESS - STERN - MORNING
Sailors make their way down a rope ladder, crowd onto the Jolly Mon. Will pushes hard against the windlass, to no avail ...  the anchor is too heavy for one man. Jack notices.
JACK
A little help?
Gillette shrugs, gestures to Murtogg and Mullroy. The three men throw their weight into the windlass, and it turns. Jack's pistol is on them the whole time.
MURTOGG
I can't believe he's doing this.
The windlass turns, bringing Mullroy into view.
MULLROY
You didn't believe he was telling the truth, either.
The windless turns some more, and there's Gillette.
GILLETTE
(over his shoulder, to
Will)
Do you have any idea, boy, what
you're doing?
53.
Another quarter turn --
WILL
No.
EXT. DAUNTLESS - FORECASTLE - DAY
Jack and Will crank a capstan, raising the forward jib sail. It luffs and billows out. The huge ship inches forward slowly, pulled by just the one sail. Jack grins.
JACK
Lookee there, mate!	We're
underway!
EXT. PORT ROYAL - DOCK - DAY
Norrington moves along, concentrating on a manifest. Alongside him is Governor Swann, who glances over --
Sees the tiny Jolly Mon headed toward them, riding low in the water, overloaded with sailors. Beyond that, the Dauntless sails -- albeit slowly -- for open waters.
SWANN
Commodore --
NORRINGTON
A moment.
SWANN
But --
NORRINGTON
Please.
SWANN
Dammit, man, it appears someone is stealing your ship!
Norrington glances out at the bay. Sure enough, the Dauntless is on the move. Norrington takes a brass telescope from his belt, opens it, trains it on --
The main deck. He picks out Will --
NORRINGTON
Rash, Turner, too rash.
-- then spots Jack, at the wheel. Lowers the telescope.
NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
That is, without a doubt, the worst pirate I have ever seen.
54.
EXT. H.M.S. DAUNTLESS - DAY
Out in the open sea, Jack leans on the wheel, relaxed; not much sailing to do with a following wind. Will looks back --
WILL
They're coming!
He points: the sails of the Interceptor fill out, and the ship cuts through the water toward them --
EXT. H.M.S. INTERCEPTOR - DAY
Norrington's smaller ship quickly comes alongside the slowmoving Dauntless. Its decks appear empty. Grappling hooks are thrown, and sailors draw the two ships together.
Norrington's men swarm across.
NORRINGTON
Search every cabin, every hold,
down to the bilges!
PULL BACK, away from the Dauntless, and past the railing of the Interceptor, where a single SENTRY stands watch -- and we find a soaked Jack and Will as they climb up over the side of the smaller ship, unseen.
Jack tackles the Sentry from behind, covers his mouth.
JACK
Can you swim?
(the man struggles)
Can.	You.	Swim?
Jack removes his hand.
SENTRY
Of course, sir.	Like a fish.	I
grew up summers living in Dover,
with my uncle --
JACK
Good.
Jack lifts the man up, throws him overbroad. Quickly unties the ropes to the grappling hooks. Will cranks the capstan bars, raising the foresail --
EXT. H.M.S. DAUNTLESS - DAY
Norrington emerges from a gangway -- and sees his other ship moving away.
55.
NORRINGTON
Sailors!	Back to the Interceptor!
But the distance is already too great. One brave sailor tries to swing across on a rope, Errol-Flyn style, but falls short with a splash.
Jack waves, and shouts across the distance --
JACK
Thank you, Commodore, for getting our ship ready to make way! We'd've had a hard time of it by ourselves!
Norrington seethes, but his order to Gillette is measured:
NORRINGTON
Raise the sails.
GILLETTE
The wind is quarter from astern ...  by the time we're underway, we'll never catch them.
NORRINGTON
We need only to come about, to put them in range of the long nines.
Gillette looks surprised at the order -- but relays it.
GILLETTE
Hands!	Come about!	Jackets off
the cannons!
(to Norrington)
We are to fire on our own ship?
NORRINGTON
Better to see it at the bottom of the sea than in the hands of a pirate.
