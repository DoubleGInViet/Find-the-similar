The STEERSMAN turns the wheel. The Dauntless' course does not change one whit.
STEERSMAN
Captain, there's a problem.
The Steersman spins the wheel. It goes round and round, with no signs of slowing.
STEERSMAN (CONT'D)
He's disabled the rudder chain,
sir.
56.
NORRINGTON
So it would seem.
The Interceptor dwindles with distance. Gillette watches it go, with some degree of admiration.
GILLETTE
He's got to be the best pirate I've ever seen.
Norrington reaches out, stops the spinning ship's wheel.
NORRINGTON
So it would seem.
The Interceptor makes for the horizon line. A SLOW DISSOLVE and with the time passage, the ship is gone; the sky turns a deep twilight blue --
EXT. CARIBBEAN SEA - EVENING
--	with the fat white moon riding just above the horizon.
Suddenly, the edge of a black sail cuts into the foreground, accompanied by the ROAR of the wind and the SNAP of canvas --
INT. BLACK PEARL - CAPTAIN'S CABIN - EVENING
Elizabeth stalks the cabin. Pintel enters, carrying a black silk dress.
PINTEL
You'll be dining with the Captain, and he requests you wear this.
ELIZABETH
Tell the captain that I am
disinclined to acquiesce to his
request.
PINTEL
(happy)
He said you say that! He also said if that be the case, you'll be dining with the crew, and you'll be naked.
Angry, Elizabeth holds out her hand. Pintel's grin fades.
PINTEL (CONT'D)
(hands it over)
Fine.
He exits, pouting. Elizabeth examines the dress --
57.
INT. BLACK PEARL - CAPTAIN'S CABIN - NIGHT
Barbossa enters, followed by PIRATES carrying trays of food, wine, table setting, etc. Elizabeth stands at the small table in the dress -- lovely.
BARBOSSA
Maid or not, it fits you.
ELIZABETH
Dare I ask the fate of it previous owner?
BARBOSSA
Now, none of that.	Please dig in.
The table is set. Elizabeth sits, cuts a tiny piece of meat, eats it daintily.
BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
No need to stand on ceremony, and no call to impress anyone. You must be hungry.
Elizabeth drops the pretense: she's starving, and begins to eat like it. Barbossa watches her intently.
BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
Try the whine.
Elizabeth does, a huge swig; she tears off a hunk of bread, devours it.
BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
And the apples -- one of those
next.
She starts to bite into the apple -- stops. She is suddenly aware of Barbossa's gaze -- and that he is not eating.
ELIZABETH
It's poisoned!
She shoves her plate away -- and takes the opportunity to palm her knife. Barbossa LAUGHS.
BARBOSSA
Oh, there would be no sense in
killing you, Miss Turner.
ELIZABETH
Then why aren't you eating?
58.
BARBOSSA
Would that I could.
He produces the medallion, lets it dangle from his fingers.
BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
Do you not know what this is, then?
ELIZABETH
It's a pirate medallion.
BARBOSSA
It's a piece of the treasure of
Isla de Muerta.
Elizabeth gives an infinitesimal shrug, intrigued despite herself.
BARBOSSA (CONTâ€™D)
Ah, so you don't know as much as you pretend. Back when Cortes was cutting a great bloody swath through the New World, a high priest gave him all the gold they had, with one condition: that he spare the people's lives. Of course, Cortes being Cortes, he didn't.
(nods)
He'd've made a great pirate, that one.
Barbossa stands, moves to a shelf. Puts a key to a medium-sized polished wooden box -- the Captain's chest. Opens it.
BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
So the priest, with his dying
breath, called on the power of the
blood of his people, and put on the
gold a curse.	If anyone took so
much as a single piece, as he was
compelled by greed, by greed he
would be consumed.
Inside the chest are charts, some gold, a sextant -- and a few pages of a Mayan CODEX, pieces of tree bark inscribed with Mayan glyphs. Barbossa removes them carefully, sets them on the table. Pours over them.
BARBOSSA (CONT'D) Within a day of leaving port for Spain, the treasure ship carrying the gold ...  something went wrong.
59.
The ship run aground, every man aboard dead, save one. He survived long enough to hide the gold ashore.
(beat)
Over time, the dark magic of the curse seeped into the place, making it a cursed island. An island of death. Isla de Muerta.
He looks up. Elizabeth has been rapt, involved in the story - - but feigns a dismissive attitude.
ELIZABETH
That's all very interesting, but I hardly believe in ghost stories anymore.
Barbossa is angry. He stands, sweeps the food off the table.
BARBOSSA
You idiot girl! It's no make-believe! My crew and I, we found the gold, and we did more than take one piece, we took it all. Rich men we were and we spent it and traded it and gave it away in exchange for drink and food and pleasant company. But we found out: the drink could not sate us, and the food turned to ashes in our mouths, and no amount of pleasant company could ease our torment.
(regains his composure)
We are cursed men, Miss Turner, condemned, to be forever consumed by our own greed. Gold calls to US, always, and we are driven, always, to find more, and add it to the treasure.
Barbossa picks up the priceless Codex. Crushes them in his fist.
BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
There is but one way to remove the curse. All of the scattered pieces of the treasure must be restored in full, and the blood repaid.
(he throws the pages
aside)
We've recovered every piece -- save for this.
(holds up the medallion)
60.
And as for the blood repaid ... 
that's what we have for you.
(pleasant, finally
getting to his point)
And that's why there's no sense
killing you.	Yet.
Elizabeth stares at him, horrified. Using the toe of his boot, Barbossa flips an apple up off the floor, catches it, extends it to Elizabeth.
BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
Apple?
Elizabeth slowly reaches for the apple -- and then comes up out of her chair, trying to run around Barbossa. They struggle briefly, and then suddenly he shoves her away --
Elizabeth's stolen KNIFE is buried in Barbossa's chest, to the hilt --
Barbossa is completely unaffected. He opens his shirt to get a better look at the knife, pulls it out with little effort. There is BLOOD on the blade, but none anywhere else.
BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
I'm curious -- after killing me, what is it you were planning to do next?
Elizabeth backs away, whirls and barrels out the door --
EXT. BLACK PEARL - MAIN DECK - NIGHT
--	Elizabeth comes to a dead stop. She stares, her jaw working, trying to scream but unable to --
The pirate crew works at their stations, coiling lines, navigating the ship, swabbing decks -- but where the moonlight falls across their bodies, they are naught but SKELETONS.
Elizabeth turns away from the sight --
Barbossa stands just inside the doorway, out of the moonlight. He grabs her roughly by the shoulders and jerks her back around -- Elizabeth shuts her eyes --
BARBOSSA
Look!
(shakes her)
LOOK! The moonlight shows us for what we really are!
61.
We are not among the living and so we cannot die --
He spins her back around to face him -- he leans forward, putting his face in the moonlight, turning it into a gleaming SKULL with gold and silver teeth --
BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
--	but neither are we dead! We have all the desires of the living, but cannot satisfy them! Ten years I have parched of thirst, and able to quench it! Ten years, I have been starving to death -- and haven't died!
(raises his hand)
And I have not felt anything for ten years ...  Not the wind on my face, nor the spray of the sea ... 
(reaches toward Elizabeth)
...  nor the flesh of a woman ... 
Elizabeth flicnhes away from the skeletal hand. It drops away -- he takes a bottle of wine from the opened case beside the cabin door, uncorks it with his teeth, raises it - -
BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
You'd best start believing in ghost stories, Miss Turner. Because now you're in one.
He tilts the bottle and drinks -- it runs over his jaw, through his rib cage, drenching his clothes.
Elizabeth darts around him, back into the cabin, and shuts the door. Barbossa hurls the bottle away.
INT. BLACK PEARL - CAPTAIN'S CABIN - NIGHT
Elizabeth huddles in the far corner of the cabin, terrified.
EXT. CARIBBEAN SEA - DAY
The Interceptor cuts across the waves. Jack at the wheel; Will tightens a line, moves back astern.
EXT. INTERCEPTOR - MAIN DECK - DAY
Will sharpens his sword with a whetstone: shhhk -- shhhk ... 
62.
JACK
For a man whose made an industry of avoiding boats, you're a quick study.
WILL
I worked passage from England as a cabin boy.
(an attempt at guile)
After my mother passed, I came out here ...  looking for my father.
JACK
Is that so?
WILL
My father.	William Turner?
Jack says nothing. Will has lost his patience for guile.
WILL (CONT'D)
I'm not a simpleton. At the jail -- it was only after you learned my name that you agreed to help me.
(a smile)
Since that's what I wanted, I didn't press the matter. But now--
(an accusation)
You knew my father.
Jack considers his relpy -- settles on 'truth'.
JACK
I knew him. Probably one of the few he knew him as William Turner. Most everyone just called him Bill, or 'Bootstrap' Bill.
WILL
'Bootstrap?'
JACK
Good man.	Good pirate.	And clever
--	I never met anyone with as clever a mind and hands as him. When you were puzzling out that cell door, it was like seeing his twin.
WILL
(angry)
That's not true.
63.
JACK
I swear, you look just like him.
WILL
It's not true my father was a
pirate.
JACK
Figured you wouldn't want to hear it.
WILL
He was a merchant marine! He was a respectable man who obeyed the law, and followed the rules--
JACK
(laughs)
You think your father is the only man who ever lived the Glasgow life, telling folk one thing, and then going off to do another? There's quite a few who come here, hoping to amass enough swag to ease the burdens of respectable life. And they're all 'merchant marines.'
WILL
My father did not think of my
mother -- his family -- as a
burden.
JACK
Sure -- because he could always go pirating.
WILL
My father -- was not -- a pirate!
Will's sword is out, levelled at Jack. Jack gives him a disbelieving look, sighs.
JACK
Put it away, Will. It's not worth getting beat again.
WILL
You didn't beat me. You ignored the rule of engagement. In a fair fight, I'd kill you.
JACK
Then that's not much incentive for me to fight fair, is it?
64.
He kicks a lever on a wench. The sail boom whips around and slams Will in the chest -- sweeping him off the ship. His
sword clatters onto the deck. Will dangles	above the	water.
Jack slips a loop of	rope around the wheel	to	hold the
course. Picks up the	sword -- and pokes at	Will with	it.
Will hand- over-hands away from the blade,	to	the end of the
boom.
JACK (CONT'D)
As long as you're just hanging there, pay attention. Must, should, do, don't, shall, shall not
--	those are just mere suggestions. There are only two absolute rules.
(ticks them off on his fingers)
What a man can do. And what a man can't do.
Will looks away, not interested.
JACK (CONT'D)
For instance: you can accept that your father was a pirate and still a good man ...  or you can't. Now me, I can sail this ship to Turga, by myself ... 
(Will looks alarmed)
But I can't just let you drown.
Jack swings the boom back in. Will drops to the deck. Jack holds the hilt of the sword out. Will takes it. Glares at Jack, considers what he'll do next. Jack watches him coolly.
Will turns and strides to his spot on the deck, sits down, and resumes sharpening his sword: shhhk -- shhhk -- shhhk ... 
Jack breathes a silent sigh of relief. Notices his shaking -- he takes the wheel.
WILL
Tortuga?
JACK
Oh -- did I forget to mention that?
EXT. TORTUGA - DAY
A dank and dirty port, where the tides seem to have swept together the sum of the Caribbean -- pirates, privateers, prostitutes, theives, and drunkards.
65.
With its cantered, rotting docks, weatherbeaten buildings, and odd assortment of livestock running free -- a donkey, chickens, etc. -- it is far less civilized than Port Royal.
Jack and Will move through the crowd. A REDHEADED woman turns her head -- she has noticed Jack.
JACK
We need a crew. We can manage the ship between islands, but the open sea, that's another matter --
Suddenly the Redhead SLAPS Jack, hard. Satisfied, she turns and strides off. Will ignores her.
WILL
Just do it quickly.
JACK
(rubbing his jaw)
Don't worry.	I've already got a
Quartermaster -- there!
Jack leads Will toward the pub: the Faithful Bride, the emblem over the door a politically incorrect painting of a smiling woman holding a bouquet in her chained-and-manacled hands.
Jack pulls open the door; Will goes inside passing a pretty
ASIAN woman coming out -- she sees Jack and immediately
SLAPS him, cursing something in Chinese. Jack backs away --
INT. FAITHFUL BRIDE - DAY
Jack closes the door on the woman, joins Will. They take in the place -- it is populated with slightly higher class of scum. Jack spots a BARTENDER, smiles, moves forward --
--	and is suddenly DECKED by a waitress. This is ANAMARIA, tall, strong, tough; she didn't spill a drink off her tray.
ANAMARIA
You stole my boat.
JACK
AnaMaria! Have you seen Gibbs? I need to put together --
She SLAPS him again. Will shakes his head, heads for the bar. Jack gets up.
66.
JACK (CONT'D)
Borrowed.	Borrowed your boat.
(off her look)
Without permission.
AnaMaria charges; Jack backs away, puts a table between them. She chases him around the table, still carrying the tray.
ANAMARIA
My dory. The Jolly Mon. Where is it?
JACK
Safe!	At Port Royal.	With the
Royal Navy.
ANAMARIA
That boat is my livelihood!
JACK
You'll get it back.	Or one better.
ANAMARIA
(a threat)
I will.
Away from them, a PATRON calls for his food. AnaMaria scowls at Jack, moves away -- comes back for one more SLAP!
WILL
Jack!	Over here!
AT THE BAR, Will has spoken to the Bartender. Jack arrives, rubbing his chin.
WILL (CONT'D)
He knows Gibbs.
The Bartender nods 'yes.' Then nods 'out back.' Then produces a water bucket from behind the bar.
Jack and Will exchange a look -- and Jack takes the bucket.
EXT. FAITHFUL BRIDE - REAR - DAY
A drunken man lays in the mud, having a friendly conversation with two pigs. He wears an old tattered Navy jacket.
A sudden SPRAY OF WATER splashes across his face, revealing: this is JOSHAMEE GIBBS (the man who told pirate stories to Elizabeth when she was a child). He sputters and roars:
67.
GIBBS
Curse you for breathing, you slack-jawed idiot.
(recognizes Jack)
Mother's love, Jack, you know
better than to wake a man when he's
sleeping.	It's bad luck!
JACK
Well, fortunately, I know how to counter it. The man who did the waking buys the man who was sleeping a drink, and the man who was sleeping it drinks it while listening to a proposition.
GIBBS
Aye, that'll about do it.
Jack helps Gibbs to his feet -- and then Gibbs is hit with a second wave of water. Will stands there with the bucket.
GIBBS (CONT'D)
Blast it, I'm already awake!
WILL
I know.	That was for the smell.
INT. FAITHFUL BRIDE - DAY
Jack and Gibbs sit at a table in the shadows, a single candle illumining them, speaking in hushed voices. Will is away from them, at the door, hand on sword, keeping a look-out.
A tankard is set down. Gibbs lifts it to take a swig --
JACK
Just the one.
Gibbs pauses. He takes a dainty sip.
GIBBS
Make it last, then.	Now, what's
the nature of this venture of
yours?
JACK
First -- have you found me a crew?
68.
GIBBS
Oh, there's a hard tale, Jack. Most of the decent pirates in town won't sail with you -- seem to think you're a jinx.
JACK
Now where, I wonder, would they
have gotten that idea?
Gibbs evades answering him by taking a long sip. Jack leans forward. Gibbs leans forward.
JACK (CONT'D)
I'm going after the Black Pearl.
Gibbs straightens up like he's been hit. He stares. He reaches for the drink as if to down it -- but then sets it back down. He leans forward again. Jack has not moved.
GIBBS
Say again?
JACK
I'm going after the Black Pearl. I know where it's going to be, and I'm going to take it.
GIBBS
Jack, it's a fool's errand: You've heard the tales they tell about the Pearl.
JACK
Aye, and that's why I know where it's going to be, and that's why I know what Barbossa is up to. All I need is a crew.
GIBBS
(shakes his head)
A fool's errand.
JACK
Not if the fool has something
Barbossa wants.	Something he
needs.
GIBBS
And you've got that, have you?
ANGLE ON: Jack, as he smiles enigmatically, and shifts his eyes -- behind him, Will, still on guard, glares a sailor away from the table.
69.
JACK
Back there, guarding the door is
the son of old Bootstrap Bill
Turner.
Gibbs' eyes widen over the edge of the tankard. Peers at Will. Then smiles, with more missing teeth than good ones.
GIBBS
Well, lookee there. I'll allow you may be onto something, Jack.
(considers, nods)
There's bound to be sailors on this rock crazy as you. I'll find some men.
Gibbs downs the drink, SLAMS the tankard on the table.
Will reacts to the sound, draws both sword and dagger, kicks over a table for cover, and whirls on anyone who moves.
GIBBS (CONTâ€™D)
Kid's a bit of a stick, isn't he?
JACK
That he is.
EXT. TORTUGA - DOCK - LATER - DAY
On the docks, a disheveled, motley and weather-beaten group of about a dozen swabs stand in a ragged line-up.
GIBBS
Feast your eyes, Cap'n. All of 'em good sea-faring men, faithful hands before the mast, every one worth their salt --
(sotto, making his point)
-- and crazy, to boot.
Jack holds up a hand -- enough. He moves down the line, Gibbs at his side. Then he notices AnaMaria in line, dressed like a man. He raises an eyebrow.
ANAMARIA
You owe me a boat.
Jack nods, continues. One sailor is quite fat, another thin and sickly. Jack is not happy with his choices.
He stops in front of COTTON, a short sailor with a large, colorful PARROT on his shoulder. Jack raises an eyebrow.
70.
GIBBS	sir.	Poor
Cotton here is mute,
devil had his tongue	cut out --
Cotton opens his mouth to show	this	-- Jack grimaces.
GIBBS (CONT'D)
--	so he went and trained the parrot to do the talking for him, nobody knows how. Nobody knows the parrot's name, neither, so we just call it 'Cotton's parrot.'
Jack decides to test this.
JACK
Mr. Cotton. Do you have the courage and fortitude to follow orders and stay true, in the face of danger, and almost certain death?
Cotton lifts the parrot off his shoulder, raises it --
COTTON'S PARROT
Wind in your SAILS!	Wind in your
SAILS!
GIBBS
Mostly, that seem to mean 'yes.'
Cotton nods vigorously, lowers the parrot, and it goes silent. Jack shakes his head. Steps back.
JACK
That goes for the rest of you!
Danger and near certain death.
(turns away)
For we are to sail for the Isla de Muerta, to rescue the daughter of Governor Swann. An equal share of the reward shall be--
Jack hears movement, looks back -- several potential crew members back away in fright; first one, then another, turn and run, followed by more.
Soon just a half dozen are left, including Cotton (with parrot) -- and AnaMaria.
WILL
Shut up, before you lose them all!
71.
JACK
These are the only ones worth
having.
(glances at the sky)
And we're going to need them --
EXT. H.M.S. INTERCEPTOR - DAY
A FLASH of lightening and the CRACK of thunder. The canvas of every sail is stretched taut. The ship rocks as it drops into the valley of huge swell, climbs up the other side.
On board, the new crew members scurry about with their tasks, pulling lines and trimming sails. Excellent sailors, it takes everything they have to keep the ship afloat.
AnaMaria is at the helm. Gibbs staggers along the deck.
GIBBS
That fool will have us lose the
canvas, and the masts besides!
On Jack, a ROARING wind blowing back his hair, eyes intent on their course. Gibbs climbs the tilted deck toward him.
GIBBS (CONT'D)
We'd best drop canvas, sir!
JACK
She can hold a bit longer.
The wind picks up, howling. Jack smiles.
GIBBS
(shouts)
What's in your head to put you in such a fine mood?
JACK
(shouts)
We're catching up!
Jack turns back to the sea, enjoying himself. Gibbs stares at him like he's a crazy man.
INT. BLACK PEARL - CAPTAIN'S CABIN - DAY
The sound of RAIN pounds down on the deck above -- then suddenly stops. Elizabeth moves to the stern windows, looks out at the rolling sea below -- no escape there.
She hears the sound of a VOICE calling, gazes up, wondering - -
72.
EXT. BLACK PEARL - CROW'S NEST - DAY
High on the main mast, Twigg cups his hands to his face, calls down:
TWIGG
Isla de Muerta!	Isla de Muerta,
off the port bow!
ON DECK, Barbossa moves to the rail. The storm clouds are breaking up. On the horizon is a dark, omnious shape: ISLA DE MUERTA. Mostly sheer unfriendly cliffs that shoot straight into the water. It is surrounded by a slate grey sea.
Barbossa grasps the rail with both hands, his expression a mixture of loathing and fear. Jacoby approaches, hesitant.
JACOBY
Orders, Captain?
BARBOSSA
Bring her in, not too close.	I
won't brave the reef, not until
high tide.	We lay anchor before
dark.
Jacoby nods, backs away. Barbossa continues to stare --
BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
...  that is, if it first doesn't sink back down to hell from where it came.
EXT. CARIBBEAN SEA - DAY
The Interceptor, on open waters, glorious, her white sails set wing-to-wing.
EXT. H.M.S. INTERCEPTOR - DAY
CLOSE ON: Jack's compass, cradled in both hands. Jack leans over and studies it -- almost like he's praying.
ON THE COMPASS -- the face shows old-fashioned rose petal style direction markers below a quivering indicator that settles on -- southeast.
JACK
Bear three points starboard.
AnaMaria turns the wheel, adjusting course. The ship leans into the new direction. Jack looks down --
73.
ON THE COMPASS -- where the indicator spins, reverses, settles on -- northeast.
JACK (CONT'D)
Six points port!
AnaMaria frowns, but follows the order, turns the wheel back, and the ship responds.
Will works on deck, coiling a rope -- but he watches Jack and AnaMaria, clearly not happy. Gibbs hobbles up.
GIBBS
Left-handed ropes are coiled
against the sun, or it's bad luck!
(twirls a finger)
Anty-clockwise.
Gibbs takes over the task. The ship shifts course again.
Will has had enough.
WILL
How do we expect to find an island no one can find -- with a compass that doesn't work?
GIBBS
Now, lad, just because it don't
point north don't mean it don't
work.
(voice low)
That compass gives bearings to the Isla de Muerta, wherever it may lay.
WILL
Really?
(moves closer)
So ...  what's the story on the
pistol?
Gibbs settles in, happy to have a willing listener.
GIBBS
I'll tell lee. Now, Jack Sparrow has an honest streak in him, and that's where the whole problem starts. This was when he was Captain of the Black Pearl --
WILL
What?	He never told me that.
74.
GIBBS
Ah -- he's learned, then. Plays things more close to the vest. See, Jack was a cartographer, back in Old England. Somehow he came by the money to commission the Pearl. Hired himself a crew, promised each man an equal share.
(lowers his voice)
So, they're forty days out, and the First Mate says, everything's an equal share, that should mean the location of the island, too. So Jack gave up the bearings.
(shakes his head)
That night, there was a mutiny.
Gibbs' voice is a whisper, now, so Will has to lean closer.
GIBBS (CONT'D)
Jack gave hisself up for the sake of his loyal crew. He was marooned on an island, left there to die.
WILL
How did he get off the island?
JACK
(loud)
I didn't!
Will and Gibbs jump. Jack is right there beside them.
JACK (CONT'D)
My body's still there, rotting
away, and I am but a ghost!
Will and Gibbs aren't sure what to make of that. Jack laughs.
GIBBS
How did you get off the island?
JACK
Ah, that's a dark and unpleasant
tale, best left untold.
He starts off.
WILL
Wait -- what about the pistol?
75.
JACK
The pistol. When a pirate is marooned, Will, he's given a pistol with a single shot. No good for hunting, or surviving, really. But after three weeks of starvation and thrist -- the option of that pistol begins to look good.
Jack lets this sink in. He pulls out the pistol, raises it.
JACK (CONT'D)
But I survived.	And I still have
that single shot.	It's meant for
one man.	My mutinous first mate--
WILL
Barbossa.
Jack shoots a glance at Will -- nods, and moves away.
EXT. ISLA DE MUERTA - CAVE ENTRANCE - EVENING
On Barbossa, face upturned. No expression in his eyes.
Around him a group of pirates, Elizabeth among them, stand as still as stones, in front of a dark cave opening. Their faces look upward, their total lack of movement disconcerting.
Above the cave, on a hillock, the pirate Koehler gazes out toward the horizon. Slowly he TRANSFORMS, head-to-toe, from pirate to SKELETON --
The MOON has climbed free of the storm clouds, rising large and full on the horizon. The skeleton turns --
KOEHLER
Moonrise, Captain! First night of full.
BARBOSSA
Hah!
(to the pirates)
Be mindful of pits and crevasses.
Stay together.
He takes a torch. Moves into the cave. The pirates follow.
INT. ISLA DE MUERTA - CAVES - NIGHT
The group keeps together under the firelight. The path leads between boulders on a slope downhill. From the echoes and shadows, it's clear the cave system must be huge.
76.
Elizabeth glances over -- the torches illumine caverns off to the side -- and just the edge of a mound of coins. Clearly there is more, but the rest is lost in darkness.
Twigg, gazing upward in wonder, moves a few feet away from the group. Barbossa grabs him as he nears a chasm.
BARBOSSA
Careful, mate. Fall down there, you'd die and miss Judgement Day -- for not even the Lord himself'll come look for you here.
Barbossa lets go, and moves on, descending down, twisting and turning, but always down --
EXT. H.M.S. INTERCEPTOR - NIGHT
Cotton pulls a sail line, looks out -- sees something. He lifts the parrot off his shoulder, strokes it along the back.
COTTON'S PARROT
Land HO! Land HO! LAND ho! LAND ho!
Indeed, the faint outline of Isla de Muerta is in the distance on the port side. Will stands, excited, jumps onto the rigging for a better look.
But AnaMaria, at the helm, stares at Cotton, and the parrot.
ANAMARIA
How does he do that?
JACK
They'll be anchored on the lee side. Haul your wind, and keep to the weather of the island --
INT. ISLA DE MUERTA - CAVES - NIGHT
Flickering torchlight. Pirates stoop low to enter a cavern --
--	and revealed is the spectacular treasure of Isla de Muerta: overflowing chests of coins, gold and silver ingots, jewelry, objects d'art, jade and ivory, brightly colored silks, furniture, jewels and pearls; mirrors and swords -- anything and everything of value that might be carried by ship, is here.
The pirates move through, Elizabeth can't help but gaze in wonder.
77.
ELIZABETH
The curse drove you to gather this?
BARBOSSA (O.S.)
Aye. And not a bit of it any use to us, only hoarded. But it will drive us no longer.
Elizabeth pauses, staring at herself in a jewel-encrusted mirror -- and then is pushed along by the pirates.
EXT. ISLA DE MUERTA - LAGOON - NIGHT
The Interceptor lies at anchor in the distance. Closer, Jack and Will row away from the large vessel in a small longboat, toward the rocky shore.
The RUSH of a waterfall grows louder. Will looks: ahead of them is a black CAVE MOUTH, right at water level.
WILL
What's that?
JACK
Depends.
WILL
On what?
JACK	stories are all
On whether the
true.  If they	are, that's a
waterfall that	spills over at high
tide, with a short drop to an
underground lagoon.  If not --
By now, the moving water	tugs on the longboat, and they are
sucked in --
JACK	(CONT'D)
-- well, too late.
The boat rushes forward,	plunges into darkness --
INT. CAVES - UNDERWATER LAGOON - NIGHT
--	the longboat takes a harrowing drop over a short waterfall ...  but then lands safely in a gorgeous underwater lagoon, floats lazily toward a sandy shore.
JACK
Chalk one up for the stories.
Will leaps out into the water, pulls the boat ashore --
78.
INT. CAVES - BED CAVERN - NIGHT
The pirate group reaches the end of a small chamber of mostly jewels and pearls piled around a large bed --
INT. CAVES - MAIN CAVERN - NIGHT
--	and then emerge into the largest cavern of all, also
crammed with treasure, including several mountains of gold coins that reach the ceiling. Treasure everywhere --
Except for one spot in the center. A hole in the ceiling lets in a column of moonlight, which illumines:
A stone chest, lid pushed back, decorated with carved Aztec glyphs, filled with gold coins identical to Will's medallion. A sharp stone knife lies on top.
In front of it, buried in the sand is a skeleton -- and this one doesn't look like it's going to move ever again, judging by the sword in its back. A crab scurries away from it as the group approaches.
BARBOSSA
Here we stand before the cursed treasure of Cortez himself. Won by blood, it demands blood in return.
All eyes turn -- onto Elizabeth. Pintel takes the stone knife from the chest, approaches her. Elizabeth shrinks back, but is held by two other pirates.
Pintel grins. Grabs her by the wrist. She turns her head away, shuts her eyes.
Pintel raises the knife ... 
...  and then very carefully, daintily, uses just the sharp tip of the knife to juck prick! Elizabeth's finger.
One tiny red drop of blood appears, and drips down onto the medallion.
Elizabeth opens her eyes, surprised.
PINTEL
What did you expect? We're all gentlemen here, right and proper.
The pirates laugh. Barbossa takes the medallion, grins at Elizabeth.
79.
BARBOSSA
You know the first thing I'm going to do after the curse is lifted?
(grins)
Eat a whole bushel of apples.
Barbossa approaches the chest, shining in the beam of moonlight.
BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
What was begun by blood, let blood now end!
He tosses the gold medallion onto the others.
The pirates tense, waiting, expectant. A long beat. They all look at each other, look at themselves. Nothing happens.
KOEHLER
Did it work?
DEADEYE
I don't feel no different.
JACOBY
How can we tell?
Barbossa frowns, draws his pistol, and SHOOTS the pirate next to him -- Jacoby -- square in the chest. Jacoby reacts in shock, grabs his chest ...  but doesn't die.
KOEHLER
You're not dead.
JACOBY
No.
(realizes)
He shot me!
TWIGG
It didn't work! The curse is still upon us!
Barbossa searches his mind for an answer ...  turns to Elizabeth.
BARBOSSA
You. Maid. Your father. What was his name?!
(grabs her roughly)
Was your father William Turner?!
Elizabeth takes time to smile before answering:
80.
ELIZABETH
No.
The pirates cry out in alarm. Barbossa gathers himself, getting his rage under steely control.
BARBOSSA
Where's his child? The child that sailed from England eight years ago, the child who is the real owner of that medallion, the child in whose veins flows the blood of William Turner?! Where?
Barbossa SLAPS her hard across the face, sending her sprawling.
JACOBY
(to Pintel)
You brought us the wrong person!
PINTEL
She had the medallion! She's the right age. She said her name was Turner!
TWIGG
(to Barbossa)
You brought us here for nothing?
Barbossa whirls on him --
BARBOSSA
If you have sailed with Morgan for ten years like I have, you'd know not to question me!
Elizabeth sits up, watching the pirates argue, for a moment unnoticed. Suddenly, a scabbard comes down, right above her.
Startled, Elizabeth looks up --
--	Will is at the top of a mound of coins, reaching down with his scabbard for her to grab onto.
Elizabeth quickly leans forward, takes the bloodied medallion from the pile. Reaches back, grabs the scabbard. Will pulls her up --
BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
If any coward here dare challenge me, let him speak! Any more talk, I'll chain ye to a cannon and send ye to the watery depths!
81.
A sound catches his attention -- coins falling. He looks up, sees Will and Elizabeth at the top of the treasure stack.
ATOP THE STACK, Will grabs a large shield, flings them forward -- the two ride down the mountain of coins on the far side, slide through a small opening --
INT. ISLA DE MUERTA - SMALL CAVERN - NIGHT
Behind them, loose coins from their slide come down in an avalanche, sealing the entrance.
Elizabeth jumps up, silver platter in hand, ready to swing -- Jack catches her before she can do any damage. They recognize each other.
ELIZABETH
You?!
JACK
Me!
ELIZABETH
You're in league with Barbossa!
JACK
No, I'm -- rescuing you.
Elizabeth can't comprehend that one.
ELIZABETH
You?!
Will gains his footing in the rubble.
WILL
Miss Swann! We're here to rescue you!
(sounds of pursuit,
approaching)
It's going badly!
JACK
This way!
They race off, toward a bit of moonlight --
INT. ISLA DE MUERTA - NIGHT
The three climb up a dark crevasse that leads out onto the island. Will takes Elizabeth's hand, helps her.
WILL
I'm glad we got here in time.
82.
ELIZABETH
Truthfully -- you were a bit late.
JACK
The trick isn't getting here, it's getting away.
As if on cue, they hear the yells of pirates, coming closer. They take off --
EXT. ISLA DE MUERTA - CLEARING - NIGHT
The three race through the rocks, the sounds of pursuit close behind. Suddenly Jack stops.
ELIZABETH
Come on!
JACK
No.	This won't work.
(a quick decision)
I'll stay behind, and fight them.
You go on.
Will and Elizabeth stare at him.
WILL
No.
JACK
I'll lead them away.
The sounds are closer.
JACK (CONT'D)
Go to the opposite end of the island, and signal the ship. I'll keep 'em busy.
WILL
Are you sure? Jack -- this is not something you have to do.
JACK
I'm sure. When you've led the kind of life that I have, there are debts that must be paid. Maybe I can balance the scales a little.
Will nods, hesitates ...  gives Jack his sword -- now Jack has two, one for each hand. Elizabeth gives him a quick kiss.
Will and Elizabeth race away, and are gone.
83.
Jack watches them a moment, turns to face the pirates. He sticks the two swords in the ground, crossed. Leans casually against a rock.
A group of pirates round a corner, cutlasses drawn, ready to fight -- but Jack raises his hand.
