JACK (CONT'D)
I invoke the right of parlay, according to the Code of the Brethren, set down down by the pirates Morgan and Bartholomew... 
EXT. ISLA DE MUERTA - NIGHT
Jack stands before Barbossa, surrounded by pirates. Jack has a wide smile on his face -- and Barbossa doesn't like it.
BARBOSSA
I'm inclined to kill you now, Jack Sparrow, without so much as a word, if you don't lose that grin from you're face.
Jack's smile remains. Barbossa puts a hand on his cutlass --
JACK
The woman's blood didn't work, did it?
Barbossa hesitates.
JACK (CONT'D)
I know whose blood you need, to end the curse.
BARBOSSA
Say the name, or I slit your
throat.
JACK
No you won't.
Barbossa nods. Pintel steps forward, puts a blade to Jack's throat. Jack's smile widen.
PINTEL
Now?
BARBOSSA
(nods)
Now.
(Pintel grins)
No, don't kill him.
84.
Surprised, Pintel lowers his cutlass. Jack's expression hasn't changed.
BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
Allow me the humor of listening to your terms.
JACK
Simple. I have something you won't more than anything. The way to free you from the curse of the treasure. You have something I want -- more than anything.
BARBOSSA
The Pearl?
(laughs)
Oh, that's fine. And just how do you expect this to work?
JACK
You give me the Pearl. Then I tell you who you need.
Barbossa stares at him, incredulous.
BARBOSSA
That's your offer? You, sailing away nice and pretty with the Black Pearl, and all I have is a name?
JACK
That's right.
BARBOSSA
I'm supposed to ...  trust you?
The pirates laugh.
JACK
I'm a man of my word.
The pirates laugh louder.
JACK (CONT'D)
You see, I've got this honest streak in me -- in its own way, a sort of curse. Oh, and there's the fact that you have no choice.
BARBOSSA
I'll torture it out of you.
85.
JACK
You left me on a desert island -- what worse can you do?
Jack is still smiling, intentionally smug now. Barbossa sees his options dwindling, begins to pace.
BARBOSSA
Blast you!	I'll throw you in
prison.
JACK
Wait as long as you like.
BARBOSSA
You're setting me up for a double cross, you with the ship, and me with nothing more than your word!
JACK
Let's say I tell you the wrong
person.	What would you do?
BARBOSSA
Track you down and --
He sees where Jack is headed.
JACK
And if I tell you the truth, you become, and you won't come near me because you know I'd kill you.
Barbossa hesitates. The pirates are amazed at how the tide has turned; Barbossa has gone past considering the idea, and might even do it.
BARBOSSA
Jack, I don't trust you, and that's a fact. Never trust a smiling man, you can lay to that.
JACK
See, that's where we're different. I trust you ...  to do what it takes to get what you want.
BARBOSSA
You're playing this as close to the edge as any man, I'll give you that.
(decides, smiles)
86.
We might just have to sign articles, you and I. Jack, you're a pirate at heart, that's certain.
Jack nods.
BARBOSSA (CONT’D) Pintel ...  set sail. If this fool plan is to work, we'll need the medallion, and that means catching the ship which brought 'em here.
Jack is completely caught off guard. For the first time, his smile fades.
JACK
What -- you don't have the
medallion?
BARBOSSA
That fool woman took it. You be careful around her, Jack -- she's pretty enough, she'll steal your heart -- but pure evil inside.
JACK
I'll watch my back.
BARBOSSA
Bosun! Set up Mr. Sparrow's quarters, nice and fine ...  in the brig.
(to Jack, a smile)
Meaning no disrespect, of course.
Jack nods, and is taken away. Barbossa stares after him, not hiding his mistrust.
EXT. INTERCEPTOR - DAY
At full sail, headed out to sea. Gibbs glances at Elizabeth and Will, talking alone on the forecastle -- shakes his head.
GIBBS
Two women on board?	A man don't
have to be superstitious to know
that's trouble.
Elizabeth holds the medallion, and finishes her tale:
ELIZABETH
...  you were in danger ...  so I
took the medallion.
87.
And I've kept it ever since. They thought I was you, that they needed my blood. And it didn't work.
She hands him the medallion.
WILL
Why would my father send this to
me?
ELIZABETH
To keep it away from them?	No
pirate would sail to London, for
fear of Execution Dock.
WILL
If I had known --
ELIZABETH
(anticipating him)
-- then we never would have met.
Will nods. They hold each other's gaze a moment. Will turns away first, leans on the rail. Looks out to sea, back the direction they came.
WILL
I can't believe he would make such a sacrifice for us.
ELIZABETH
I guess you can never truly know
someone else's heart.
Will glances at her, and nods.
AT THE HELM, Gibbs peers forward, scanning the horizon.
There is a tiny island in front of them.
GIBBS
Shift your heading, steer clear of that island. Fifteen degrees starboard.
On the aft deck, Cotton concentrates on his work, securing a halyard. Suddenly Cotton's parrot flaps its wings, takes off, lands on the starboard bulwark, squawking --
COTTON'S PARROT
Dead men tell NO tales! Dead men tell NO tales! Dead men tell NO tales!
88.
Cotton looks up -- on the horizon, following: black sails.
Gibbs and AnaMaria appear, and see the ship.
ANAMARIA
Can we outrun them?
GIBBS
Not a chance.	Make for the reef.
EXT. CARIBBEAN OCEAN - DAY
Miles of blue water. The Interceptor tacks, leaving a long white wake. The Black Pearl matches it -- gaining.
EXT. BLACK PEARL - DAY
Barbossa and Pintel eye the Interceptor, two hounds chasing the fox.
PINTEL
What's he doing? Is her going to run her aground?
EXT. INTERCEPTOR - DAY
The Black Pearl is now close behind the Interceptor -- and the Interceptor is headed for the island.
GIBBS
Drop the forward anchor!
A SAILOR at the stern of the ship pulls a release, and the ship's anchor races down into the water, the metal chain jumping and twisting on deck.
The chain stops, and the Sailor locks it --
EXT. CARIBBEAN SEA - DAY
With its forward momentum and the anchor down, the Interceptor makes to turn quickly, pivoting around the anchor.
EXT. BLACK PEARL - DAY
Barbossa and Pintel watch as the huge ship brings its cannons to bear right in front of them.
BARBOSSA
All hands!	Prepare to come about!
But for now, the Interceptor has the advantage, and takes it: its cannons boom, and cannonballs rain down.
89.
INT. BLACK PEARL - BRIG - DAY
Jack sees what he can out the porthole. In the cell with him is Twigg, acting as a guard.
JACK
Don't hit my ship!	I mean, kill
the lying scoundrel --
(to Twigg)
I'm a little conflicted, here.
Twigg just stares.
EXT. INTERCEPTOR - DAY
Elizabeth watches as the Black Pearl comes about -- and then there is the low, loud RUMBLE of two dozen cannons firing as one. The Interceptor is hit. A barrage of shots follow; most find their mark.
Sailors dive for cover, leaving their cannons; clearly they are overmatched.
EXT. BLACK PEARL - PORT SIDE - DAY
Barbossa laughs.
BARBOSSA
Strike your colors, you bloody
cockroaches!
EXT. INTERCEPTOR - DAY
Another round of fire; Barbossa shows no mercy.
ANAMARIA
Looks like they mean to send us
under.
GIBBS
There -- she's raised the Jolly
Roger, upside down.
AnaMaria, Gibbs, Cotton, even Elizabeth -- all know what this means. Will doesn't. He looks to Gibbs for an explanation:
GIBBS (CONT'D)
It's a signal. If we resist, it won't just be death. There'll be torture as well.
WILL
We're not going to just surrender!
90.
GIBBS
That we are.
The Black Pearl fires again, a double-ball shot with a chain connecting the two. It hits the main mast dead on! A CRACKING, SPLINTING sound as it breaks, falls to the deck.
Barbossa moves his ship alongside, preparing to board.
WILL
We can at least fight -- we might be able to kill a few--
GIBBS
Will -- it'll go worse for us -- for Elizabeth, especially -- if we fight.
Will stares -- and nods. But his expression is still defiant.
The deck slants; the ship is sinking. Pirates swarm across on ropes, and take control of the Interceptor.
EXT. BLACK PEARL - MAIN DECK - DAY
The top masts of the H.M.S. Interceptor sink into the smooth crystal waters of the Caribbean --
--	as Will and Elizabeth, held by pirates, are brought before Barbossa -- and see that Jack stands beside him, manacled.
Gibbs, AnaMaria and Cotton and the other crewmembers huddle together.
Barbossa's wrath falls on Elizabeth.
BARBOSSA
Welcome back, Miss. Last time on board, you played me right clever, make pretending and all. I hope your stay this time is more pleasant. Boys, show her some hospitality!
He shoves her into a group of pirates; they yell their approval. She is pushed from one to another.
This goads Will to action. He head-butts the pirate behind him, grabs a pistol, waves it at the pirates.
WILL
She goes free!
91.
Will leaps onto the ship's rail. He steadies himself with a hand on the rigging. Points the pistol at Barbossa.
BARBOSSA
What's in your head, boy?
WILL
She.	Goes.	Free.
BARBOSSA
You've got one shot -- and we can't die.
WILL
You can't.	I can.
He leans out over the ocean.
ELIZABETH
No!
Jack pushes forward.
JACK
Will -- don't do anything stupid!
Don't say anything stupid --
WILL
My name is Will Turner, the son of Bootstrap Bill Turner. His blood runs in my veins.
(raises the gun to his
head)
You need my blood. And on my word I will pull this trigger, and sink all the way down to Davy Jones' Locker!
Pintel squints at Will; the pirates murmur surprise.
TWIGG
It's true -- he's the spittin' image of Old Bootstrap. Even talks the same!
Jack drops his head. Barbossa grins at him.
BARBOSSA
Looks like your back to having
nothing to offer.
PINTEL
And he's got Old Bill's courage. A curse on him, and you!
92.
Barbossa steps forward.
BARBOSSA
Enough of that!
(to Will)
Name your terms.
WILL
Elizabeth goes free!
BARBOSSA
We got that part.	Anything else?
WILL
And Jack. And the crew. Free and unharmed. If you agree ...  then ...  I will remain with you.
Barbossa considers; his crew waits. Finally --
BARBOSSA
Agreed.	You have my word, as a
gentleman of fortune --
ELIZABETH
Will -- you can't trust him.
WILL
You must swear by the Holy Bible.
BARBOSSA
Eh? You have my word, then -- on the Good Book, I do swear, and the Lord spare my worthless soul.
Barbossa crosses himself, as do many of his men.
Will lowers his gun ...  steps downs -- the pirates surround him. They snatch away the pistol.
BARBOSSA (CONT'D) Boatswain! Take your captives belowdecks. Chain them in the galley, and teach 'em how to row.
Gibbs, AnaMaria, Cotton and the rest are led away under guard. Barbossa looks out to sea, toward the islet.
BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
Hah. Look there. That's the very same island we made Jack governor of on our last trip.
(nods)
93.
When you sail the open sea as long as I, you learn to trust the signs fate sends your way.
GIBBS
(dejected)
Amen to that ... 
BARBOSSA
Jack, Elizabeth ...  I'm a man of my word and you're to be set free, right quick.
(loudly)
Men, break out the plank!
A CHEER goes up from the pirates. Will realizes what Barbossa intends to do, struggles with captors.
WILL
No!	You gave your word!
BARBOSSA
Quite, boy, or you'll lose your tongue. Those as know me know I wouldn't cross my word, and bring down bad luck on the ship.
(nods)
I agreed to set them free.	I
didn't when ...  nor where.
EXT. CARIBBEAN SEA - DAY
The Black Pearl lies at anchor, closer now to the islet.
EXT. BLACK PEARL - MAIN DECK - DAY
Jack, wrists still bound, stands in the classic 'walking the plank' pose. Elizabeth is next in line. Pirates crowd the ship's rail to watch.
JACK
It's pure evil to make a Captain walk the plank of his own ship, twice in one lifetime. No good can come of it.
BARBOSSA
Now, Jack. That reef is less than a league distant. It's a square deal all around, and you can't hope for better.
94.
JACK
Someone needs to cut these bonds, then.
Barbossa smiles, shows a pistol. Points it at Jack.
BARBOSSA
You'd best take a swim, Jack.
JACK
The last time you do this, you left me a pistol, with one shot.
The pirates mutter agreement.
PINTEL
That's proper, sir, according to
the code.
BARBOSSA
By the powers, you're right!
(turns around)
Where's Jack's pistol? Who's got it? Bring it forward!
JACK
A gentleman might give us two pistols, seeing as there are two of us, this time.
A pirate hands Jack's pistol to Barbossa.
BARBOSSA
Tell you what. I'll give you one pistol, and let you be the gentleman, and shoot the lady, and starve to death yourself!
(grins)
That is, presuming you're not both drownded.
The pirates laugh. Barbossa tosses Jack the pistol -- but over his head, and down into the water with a splash.
BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
So how did you get off that island, anyway?
JACK
You can go to your grave not
knowing.
BARBOSSA
That's fair.
95.
Jack glares at Barbossa. Then he's prodded with a cutlass, takes a step out. Reaches the end of the plank -- steps off.
Jack plunges down into the water. Appears on the surface, floundering, struggles to stay afloat. Will and Elizabeth exchange helpless looks; there is nothing they can do.
BARBOSSA (CONT’D)
The lady's next. But first, I'll be wanting that dress back, if you please.
Elizabeth hesitates ...  then strips it off, leaving her in a silk slip. She throws it at him.
ELIZABETH
Here -- it will go well with your blackheart!
Barbossa indicates the plank.
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
I will not walk into the ocean.
You'll have to throw me in!
Barbossa raises an eyebrow, grins, nods.
BARBOSSA
Have at her, lads!
The pirates rush to comply. Lift her up, toss her over the rail -- with a scream she falls --
EXT. CARIBBEAN SEA - UNDERWATER - DAY
We follow Elizabeth amid foam and bubbles as she PLUNGES down through the water. Blue and clear, with streaks of sunlight cutting down; bright coral and tropical fish, and a lovely young woman in a silk dress ...  if it weren't for the mortal danger, the scene could be described as gorgeous.
Elizabeth spots Jack, below her now, sinking, struggling.
She swims down ...  unties his bonds.
Elizabeth starts for the surface. Inexplicably, Jack swims the other way, further down into the depths.
EXT. CARIBBEAN SEA - DAY
Elizabeth breaks the surface, looks around. And then, finally Jack appears, sucking in air. He shows what he went after: his pistol. He tucks it into his shirt.
96.
ELIZABETH
You went back for that? We need to head for the reef!
She starts swimming. Jack hesitates. The Black Pearl is already underway; he stares at it.
JACK
That's the second time I've had to watch that man sail away with my ship.
He turns away, and swims after Elizabeth.
EXT. ISLET - BEACH - DAY
CLOSE ON: The surf line. Elizabeth's feet leave prints in the sand ...  and then meet up with matching footprints she made earlier, going in the same direction. She has walked all the way around the island.
JACK (O.S.)
Not all that big, is it?
Jack lays on the beach. He has dismantled his pistol; the parts, ball and powder dry on his scarf.
ELIZABETH
Has it changed since the last time you were here?
JACK
The trees are taller.
Jack checks to see if the pistol parts are dry; they are. He sets about re-assembling and loading his pistol.
ELIZABETH
I hope you have no intention of
using that.
Jack has finished putting his pistol back together. He shoves it in his belt, walks off.
JACK
Not yet.	Ask me again in a few
weeks.
Elizabeth can't believe it.
ELIZABETH
Captain Sparrow!	We have to get
off this island -- immediately!
97.
JACK
Don't be thinking I'm not already working on it.
He climbs up toward a clump of palm trees. Digs for something beneath the sand. He finds it: a large iron ring.
ELIZABETH
What is that?	Is there a boat
under there?
Jack heaves the trap door up and over, revealing a pit. Inside are barrels and bottles of rum ...  all covered with dust and cobwebs, long abandoned. Jack's face falls.
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
What? What's wrong? How will this help us get off the island?
JACK
It won't.	It won't, and so we
won't.
He jumps down into the pit, cracks open a bottle of rum, takes a swig.
ELIZABETH
But ...  you did it before!	Last
time --
JACK
Last time, I was here a grand total of three days. Last time, the rumrunners who used this island as a cache came by, and I bartered passage off. But from the looks of this, they've been out of business, and so that won't be happening again.
(takes another swig)
We probably have your friend
Norrington to thank for that.
ELIZABETH
So that's it? That's the secret grand adventure of the infamous Jack Sparrow? You spent three days on the beach drinking rum?
JACK
Welcome to the Caribbean, love.
He gathers up a few bottles, heads for the beach.
98.
JACK (CONT'D)
You should look at our contretemps this way: we've got shade trees, thank the Lord. We've got some food on the trees, thank the Lord again. And we've got rum, praise the Lord. We can stay alive a month, maybe more. Keep a weather eye open for passing ships, and our chances are fair.
ELIZABETH
A month? Will doesn't have a month! We've got to do something to help him!
JACK
You're right.
(hoists the bottle)
Here's luck to you, Will Turner.
He drinks -- and difiantly returns Elizabeth's angry gaze.
But then turns away, sits down.
JACK (CONT'D)
Don't be thinking I'm happy about this, Elizabeth. But I see no use in wailing and gnashing my teeth over that which I can do nothing about.
ELIZABETH
Not when you can drink instead, at least.
Jack tosses her a bottle.
JACK
Try it. It goes down rough, but it goes down -- and the second swig goes down easier.
Elizabeth considers. Comes to a decision. She unseals the bottle, takes a swig. They sit in silence for a bit.
ELIZABETH
And you will call me Miss Swann.
Jack toasts her: you got it. Elizabeth studies her bottle ...  gives Jack a sidelong glance. Back to her bottle ... 
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
(under her breath)
Drink up me hearties, yo ho ... 
99.
JACK
What?	What was that?
(Elizabeth smiles)
Something funny, Miss Swann? Share, please.
ELIZABETH
Nothing ...  it's nothing. Just ...  I'm reminded of a song I learned as a child. A song about pirates.
JACK
I know a lot of songs about
pirates, but none I'd teach a
child.	Let's hear it.
ELIZABETH
Oh, no ...  it's silly. Back in England we didn't know a thing about pirates, really. They seemed so romantic and daring --
Jack likes the way that sounds.
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
(looks at him)
That was before I met one, of
course.
JACK
Now I must hear this song. An authentic pirate song. Have at it.
ELIZABETH
Well, perhaps ...  with a bit more to drink, I might ... 
JACK
More to drink!
He gathers two more bottles, tosses one to her. She drops her half-finished bottle to catch it. Opens it, takes a sip.
JACK (CONT'D)
Well?
Elizabeth clears her throat, begins to sing self-consciously, becoming stronger as she goes on.
ELIZABETH
We pillage, we plunder, we rifle, we loot, Drink up me hearties, yo ho.
100.
She gestures for him to drink. He does.
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
We kidnap and ravage and we don't give a hoot, Drink up me hearties, yo ho --
EXT. ISLET - BEACH - LATER - NIGHT
The middle of the night. A fire BLAZES. Jack and Elizabeth are roaring drunk, arm in arm, singing the song all the way up to the stars --
JACK/ELIZABETH
Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for me! Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for me!
JACK
I LOVE this song!
(sings)
Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for me! We're beggars and blighters, ne'er do well cads, Drink up me hearties, yo ho!
(gives it a touch of
Irish ballad)
Aye but we're loved by out mums and our dads. Drink up me hearties, yo ho!
They hoist their bottles, but only Jack drinks. He drains the bottle, then tosses it away.
JACK (CONT’D)
When I get the Black Pearl back, I'm going to teach it to the whole crew, and we'll sing it all the time!
ELIZABETH
You'll be positively the most
fearsome pirates to sail the
Spanish Main.
Elizabeth salutes the idea with her bottle. Jack doesn't have a bottle to salute back. She hands him hers. He drinks, then settles shakily to the ground. Elizabeth sits beside him.
JACK
Not just the Spanish Main.	The
whole ocean ...  the whole world.
Wherever we want to go, we go.
101.
That's what a ship is, you know. Not just a keel and a hull and a deck and sails. That's what a ship needs ...  but what a ship is -- what the Black Pearl really is ...  is freedom.
Elizabeth lays her head on his shoulder.
ELIZABETH
Jack, it must be so terrible for
you, to be trapped here on this
island, all over again.
JACK
Ah, well ...  the company is better than last time. And the scenery has definitely improved.
ELIZABETH
(coy)
Mr. Sparrow! I'm not sure I've had enough rum to allow that kind of talk.
JACK
We've got a few bottles left ... 
and we've yet to tap the kegs.
Elizabeth shrugs with a sleight -- but promising -- smile.
She picks up the empty bottle from the ground, holds it up.
ELIZABETH
To freedom.
JACK
To the Black Pearl.
They tap the bottles together. Elizabeth feigns a drink as he chugs. He taps his bottle against hers again. She laughs, feigns another drink --
EXT. ISLET - BEACH - MORNING
CLOSE ON -- JACK'S FACE, dead asleep, lying in the sunlight. His nose twitches. A bit of SMOKE drifts by. His nose twitches again. His eyes open.
Jack GROANS and sits up. He rubs his head, looks over --
--	all of the foliage in the middle of the island is ON FIRE. Smoke rises high up into the clear blue sky.
102.
Jack leaps to his feet. He sees Elizabeth, as she pours out the last of the rum, dowsing a scrub brush at the base of a palm tree. It goes up in FLAMES. She rolls the barrel forward -- it starts to BURN merrily.
Jack can't believe his eyes.
JACK
What are you doing? You've burned our food, the shade -- the rum!
ELIZABETH
Yes, the rum is gone.
She wipes her hands together. One of the rum barrels in the fire EXPLODES.
JACK
Why?
ELIZABETH
One, because it is a vile drink
that turns even the most
respectable men into scoundrels.
Two --
She points to the sky.
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
That signal is over a thousand feet high, which means it can be seen for two hundred leagues in every direction. The entire Royal Navy is out to sea looking for me -- do you think there is even a chance they could miss it?
JACK
You -- you burned up the island,
for a one-time chance at being
spotted?
ELIZABETH
Exactly.
Elizabeth turns toward the sea.
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
Just you wait, Captain.	In an
hour, maybe two, keep a 'weather
eye open' and you'll be seeing
white sails on that horizon!
103.
She sits down, determined. Shields her eyes, scans the water, waiting, searching. Jack is speechless. He throws up his hands, stalks up the sand dune, just to get away from her.
EXT. ISLET - LEEWARD SHORE - DAY
At the crest of the dune, Jack stops -- and stares, incredulous. We come around to see what he is looking at --
Past Jack, anchored on the other side of the island, white sails glorious against the turquoise waters, is the H.M.S. Dauntless. A longboat is already being rowed toward them.
Jack shakes his head.
JACK
They'll be no living with her after this.
EXT. H.M.S. DAUNTLESS - MAIN DECK - DAY
Norrington gives Elizabeth a hand disembarking from the raised longboat.
NORRINGTON
Elizabeth, I'm relieved you're
safe.
(re: Jack)
Clap him in irons. And behind his back this time.
ELIZABETH
Commodore, you can't do that!
NORRINGTON
You're speaking up for him again?
ELIZABETH
He can locate Isla de Muerta -- but I doubt he'll be willing to help us from the brig.
JACK
(she's right)
We had time to get to know each
other.
NORRINGTON
We are bound for Port Royal, not
Isla de Muerta.
ELIZABETH
No.	The pirates have taken Will --
104.
NORRINGTON
Your father is frantic with worry. Our mission was to rescue you and return home. That is what we shall do. Mr. Turner's fate is regrettable. But so was his decision to engage in piracy.
ELIZABETH
Commodore, please!
JACK
Norrington, think about it ...  the Black Pearl, its captain and crew
...  the last pirate threat in the Caribbean. How can you pass that up?
NORRINGTON
By remembering that I serve others, not only myself.
ELIZABETH
Commodore, I beg you -- please do this ...  for me. As a wedding gift.
NORRINGTON
I am to understand that you will accept my marriage proposal on the condition I rescue Mr. Turner?
ELIZABETH
Not as a condition -- a request.
Norrington considers. To Gillette:
NORRINGTON
Free Mister Sparrow, and prepare to come about. He'll give you our heading.
Gillette unlocks Jack's manacles. Jack raises an eyebrow.
JACK
Congratulations, sir.
Crew men lead Jack toward the bridge. Sailors go about their tasks, and the ship begins its slow turn.
NORRINGTON
Elizabeth, I hereby withdraw my
proposal.
105.
ELIZABETH
What?
NORRINGTON
I know where your heart truly lies.
Elizabeth looks at Norringtom, seeing him in a new light.
ELIZABETH
And now I know ...  where yours
does, as well.
They gaze at each other a moment. Norrington looks away.
NORRINGTON
You may seclude yourself in my cabin. I'm afraid we do not have any ladies' clothing aboard.
ELIZABETH
Then I can wear men's clothing.
NORRINGTON
That would hardly be proper.
ELIZABETH
Well, I am not going to stay hidden in some cabin, or I suppose it's going to be heaving bosoms and bare for the remainder of the voyage!
Norrington is exasperated, but then can't help but grin -- this is exactly why he loves her. She grins back at him -- she's not going to change.
NORRINGTON
Murtogg, take our guest below, and find her some trousers, and a shirt.
Elizabeth smiles, allows herself to be escorted away. Norrington watches her go ...  then turns his gaze to the sea.
INT. THE BLACK PEARL - BRIG - DAY
Pintel enters the cell. It appears empty -- but that's because Will is hanging from the rafters, trying to shove up the ceiling planks with his legs.
PINTEL
That ain't going to work. That's the gun deck above yea.
106.
Will drops lightly to the deck. Suddenly:
WILL
What happened to William Turner?
PINTEL
Ah, William Turner. Stupid blighter. He threw in with us after we relieved Jack Sparrow of his captaincy, but turned out, it never sat well with him -- particularly after we found Cortes' treasure, and its peculiar condition. He thought we deserved to be cursed, for leaving ol' Jack to the fate we did. That's why he sent off a piece of the treaure -- to you, as it were: so it would never be recovered, and so cursed we remain.
WILL
And then he ran. And he's hiding out someplace where you haven't been able to find him.
PINTEL
That's a nice thought, to be sure, and I wager your da wishes he'd thought it hisself. But, no. See, what he'd done, didn't sit too well with Captain Barbossa ...  so he chained a cannon to his legs and dumped him over.
Will reacts with shock at the account of his father's fate.
PINTEL (CONT’D)
Yep, last I saw of Bootstrap Bill, was his face looking up, as he sank down to the crushing black oblivion of Davy Jones' locker.
(sighs)
It was only after, we found out we needed his blood to solve the curse. That's what you call ironic.
Barbossa appears behind Pintel, flanked by several others pirates. He regards Will for a moment, then:
BARBOSSA
Bring him.
107.
EXT. H.M.S. DAUNTLESS - MAIN DECK - EVENING
Jack goes to the rail and waits, pretending to look out at the sea. Elizabeth, dressed in sailor's clothes to excellent effect, joins him.
ELIZABETH
You didn't tell Commodore
Norrington everything.
JACK
Nor did you, I noticed.
ELIZABETH
He might delay the rescue ...  and that would be too late.
JACK
Exactly.
ELIZABETH
These men will be facing an enemy that seemingly cannot be killed.
JACK
I have a plan. If it succeeds, then any battle will be decidedly brief ...  and one-sided.
ELIZABETH
What's your plan?
LOOKOUT (O.S.)
LAND HO!
Isla de Muerta lay dark and menacing on the horizon.
NORRINGTON
Elizabeth -- below decks. I will not compromise your safety.
She starts to speak; he turns away.
NORRINGTON (CONT'D) Lieutenant, escort Elizabeth to my quarters, and make sure she stays there.
Norrington gazes through his spyglass, at the island. Jack watches with some amusement as Elizabeth is escorted away.
108.
NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
I don't like the situation, Mister Sparrow. The island is riddled with caves. I will not put my men at a disadvantage.
JACK
Funny, I was thinking along those lines. How about you let me go in alone, and while you're setting up an ambush, I'll trick the pirates out to you.
NORRINGTON
You would do that?
JACK
They left me stranded. Twice. What have you got to lose?
NORRINGTON
(looks at him)
Nothing I wouldn't be please to be rid of.
JACK
(smiles)
I knew you'd listen to reason!
EXT. ISLA DE MUERTA - CAVE ENTRANCE - EVENING
Torches are lit. Barbossa leads Will, guarded by Pintel and a band of pirates, into the caves.
INT. H.M.S. DAUNTLESS - MAIN DECK - NIGHT
A longboat is prepared to be lowered over the side. Jack wraps his pistol securely in an oilskin pouch.
JACK
That chart I drew up'll get you past the reefs. If you're steersman's good enough, that is.
NORRINGTON
I'll be at the wheel myself.
JACK
I'll slip in, talk them into to come out, and you'll be free to blow holy high heaven the whole lot of them.
The crewmen release the lines, and the boat drops --
109.
INT. ISLA DE MUERTA - CAVES - NIGHT
The pirate group moves deeper into the caves. Will moves along unwillingly.
PINTEL
No reason to fret. It's just a prick of the finger and a few drops of blood.
BARBOSSA
Turner blood doesn't flow pure in his veins.
(grins)
Best play it safe, and spill it
all.
PINTEL
I guess there is a reason to fret.
EXT. ISLA DE MUERTA - NIGHT
The Dauntless drifts into the lagoon. Norrington and his men prepare to go ashore.
INT. ISLA DE MUERTA - CAVES - NIGHT
Lit by torchlight. Will notices: a crack runs between the floor and the wall of the cave, widening into a ravine.
BARBOSSA
Careful, now. You could fall in and still be wonder'n when you'll hit dirt.
Will makes a decision. He intentionally stumbles. Pintel shoves him forwad -- Will continues forward, grabs the pirate in front of him, swings him into the wall of the cave. Catches the pirate's torch, and uses it to ward off the others.
WILL
You deserve to be cursed -- and
remain cursed!
He steps to one side -- and drops into the ravine. The wall of the ravine becomes a loose gravel slope; Will hits it, and tumbles down, disappeats into black.
BARBOSSA
Blast him! A pox on him, and his father, and the whole damnable line! Fan out! Find him!
110.
INT. DAUNTLESS - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - NIGHT
Elizabeth looks out the Captain's small porthole -- sees boats laden with Navy men headed for shore.
She turns away from the porthole, wishing there was something she could do. Suddenly there is a flutter at the window --
Cotton's parrot is there.
COTTON'S PARROT
Drink UP me hearties yo ho!	Drink
UP me hearties yo ho!
The bird flutters off; Elizabeth races to the porthole, and then to the stern window to see it fly away.
She looks down -- and there, fastened to the stern of the ship, is a small rowboat.
INT. ISLA DE MUERTA - CAVES - NIGHT
Will races forward, turning this way and that. He sees a light ahead, heads for it, turns a corner --
-- and runs straight into Jack.
JACK
Do you have any idea where you're going?
WILL
Jack!
JACK
Don't talk.	These caves magnify
sound.	Just follow me.
EXT. ISLA DE MUERTA - THE BEACH - NIGHT
Norrington and men land on the beach, and spread out. They silently take up positions around the main cave entrance.
INT. CAVES - NIGHT
Jack leads Will out of a narrow passage -- and stops, staring. Will is a few steps behind.
WILL
Are you certain this is the right way?
111.
JACK
It's the right way.
Will joins him -- and sees what Jack is staring at:
Treasure piled on treasure, sparkling, glowing, seemingly endless. At the center is the moonlit clearing, and the stone Aztec chest.
BARBOSSA
Thank you, Jack Sparrow.
They jump -- Barbossa is standing right behind them, flanked by his men. The trio whirl to run -- more pirates emerge from hiding. Nearly the entire crew of the Black Pearl is there.
The pirates grab Will and Jack. Will struggles, but Jack does not fight at all.
BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
You couldn't have led him back more directly if you knew exactly where you were going.
He laughs, and moves toward the stone chest. The pirates follow, dragging Will and Jack with them.
WILL
You did know where you were going!
You did lead us directly to them!
(Jack's silence confirms
it)
Why?
Jack looks away -- as Will is manhandled toward the chest. Barbossa steps up to him (becoming skeletal in the moonlight) and puts the medallion around Will's neck.
He picks up the stone knife.
BARBOSSA
What was begun by blood, let blood now end!
He raises the knife to Will's throat --
JACK
You don't want to be doing that.
Barbossa pretends to think about his words.
BARBOSSA
No, I really think I do.
112.
JACK
(shrugs)
All right then.
That makes Barbossa pause. He steps out of the moonlight.
BARBOSSA
Why don't I want to do this?
JACK
Because, right about now, the H.M.S. Dauntless is lying in wait in the harbor.
WILL
Jack!
JACK
--	and its guns and crew will cut you and your men to pieces the moment you step outside these caves.
A buzz of apprehension sweeps through the pirates.
PINTEL
Do you believe him?
BARBOSSA
No.
(indicates Will)
But him I believe. He us genuinely angry.
JACK
You've no hope of surviving Norrington's attack ...  that is, if you're mortal.
BARBOSSA
What're you suggesting?
Jack shakes off the hands holding him, strolls toward Barbossa, Will, and the chest of coins.
JACK
Simple.	Don't kill the boy yet.
Wait for a more opportune moment.
Will glares, listening to every word he says. Jack scoops up a handful of coins from the chest.
113.
JACK (CONT'D)
(drops the coins one- by-
one back into the chest)
Like after you've killed ...  Every
...  Last ...  One ...  of
Norrington's men.
BARBOSSA
I can't help wondering, Jack, why you're being so helpful and all? Last time you did that, it didn't end well for you.
JACK
The situation has changed.
BARBOSSA
That so?
JACK
Aye. See, after you're done with the Royal Navy, you'll have a bit of a problem: the H.M.S. Dauntless. There you'll be, with two lovely ships on your hands, and what to do? Of course you'll decide you deserve the bigger one, and who's to argue? The Dauntless a first-rate ship-of-line, and with it, you can rule the seas.
(beat)
But if you're Captain of the Dauntless, who's left for the Black Pearl?
Jack smiles and spreads his hands: me.
JACK (CONT'D)
I sail for you as part of your fleet, I give you fifteen percent of my plunder, and you get to introduce yourself at tea parties and brothels as 'Commodore Barbossa.'
(sticks out his hand)
Do we have an accord?
Barbossa licks his lips. It's tempting ... 
JACK (CONT'D)
Now, you can take care of the
Dauntless, right?
114.
BARBOSSA
Men!	Are you up for it?
The pirates yell to the affirmative.
BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
Mr. Pintel, select five men to stay here. Take the rest of the men out ...  not through the caves.
Jack's expression falters; this he hadn't planned for.
JACK
There's ...  another exit?
BARBOSSA
Aye, for us there is.
EXT. LAGOON - UNDERWATER - NIGHT
Moonlight shines down into the shallow waters, brightening coral, sparkling over the rippled sand floor.
Suddenly all the fish SCATTER. Briefly, the waters are empty.
And then FIGURES appear in the distance, seeming to waver in the shifting current. They scuffle forward, kicking up clouds of sand --
The figures resolve into the skeleton PIRATES, moving silently across the lagoon floor, swords glinting. The tatters of their clothing drift in the water. Their skull heads are fixed in an endless grin.
The LEAD PIRATE glides forward --
And stops next to a huge iron ANCHOR -- twice his height, even buried halfway into the sand. A heavy CHAIN with barrel-sized links climbs up toward the surface --
A SHADOW falls across the Lead Pirate -- he TRANSFORMS, and we see that it is Pintel. He looks up --
Above, the heavy chain leads to the giant bottom hull of the H.M.S. Dauntless, silhouetted by moonlight.
The huge shift drifts, again spilling moonlight below --
And the pirates gathered around the anchor are once again SKELETONS, staring with upturned faces. The Pintel-skeleton puts a knife between his teeth, starts to crawl up the iron rings.
115.
Other pirates crowd forward, and soon the anchor-chain is clustered with skeletons --
EXT. LAGOON - NIGHT
Elizabeth has the small boat out, and rows away from the Dauntless, looking ahead over her shoulder. Cotton's parrot is nowhere to be seen.
In the distance, Pintel breaks the surface near the Dauntless, intent on climbing the anchor; he looks over --
Just as Elizabeth rounds the point, and rocks obscure the small longboat from view.
More skeleton-pirates appear, and Pintel continues his climb.
EXT. LAGOON - DAUNTLESS - NIGHT
Two SAILORS, alert and vigilant, stare out toward shore. The island reveals nothing but blackness.
There is a scurrying sound -- bones scraping against wood -- and the sailors JUMP. They listen, intently -- nothing.
TALL SAILOR
Ship rats.	Big ones.
SHORT SAILOR
(nods)
Hate those things.
They turn back toward the island, continue their vigil. A long pause.
SHORT SAILOR (CONT'D)
Taste all right, though.
TALL SAILOR
That they do.
>From behind, the two sailors at the rail are well-lit by a lantern. Suddenly shadows appear, skeletons, climbing up the sailor's backs. MOVE CLOSER and then the skeletons appear, reaching -- the two sailors are grabbed from behind --
EXT. DAUNTLESS - SIDE - NIGHT
Two bodies are tossed out over the rail, hit the water with a splash.
116.
EXT. DAUNTLESS - SIDE - NIGHT
Pintel looks down into the water, satisfied. Puts away his knife. Notices, pulls out a long piece of seaweed from his rib cage. Tosses it. Turns to the others.
PINTEL
Be quick, now. Train the starboard guns on the beach, and set your aim. Wait for my signal, we don't want to spook them.
The pirates hurry to comply --
EXT. LAGOON - BLACK PEARL - NIGHT
Elizabeth rounds the point further, and sees: the Black Pearl, anchored in the neighboring cove. A fleck of color -- Cotton's parrot, as it darts through a porthole.
Elizabeth slows her efforts, silently approaching the ship.
EXT. BLACK PEARL - MAIN DECK - NIGHT
Four PIRATES -- who really ought to be keeping watch -- instead have gathered wine bottles and rum casts into a pile, along apples, biscuits -- all the food on the ship.
They act out a mock-feast, in anticipation of the curse being lifted. A SKINNY skeleton offers two bottles to a BIG BONES skeleton.
SKINNY
Which would you prefer first, good sir -- rum, or wine?
BIG-BONES
I believe I'll have a spot o' rum, if you don't mind, and thank'ee kind sir!
They burst out laughing -- a hideous sound that wheezes through their bones.
Behind them, unnoticed, Elizabeth peeks catiously around a corner. She picks her moment and sneaks past quickly, down a gangway, disappearing into the darkness of the ship.
EXT. ISLA DE MUERTA - BEACH - NIGHT
Gillette crouches, running low behind a line of rocks. He reports to Norrington:
117.
GILLETTE
All the men in place, sir. Ready to fire.
NORRINGTON
Wait for my order -- what the
blazes is that?
It's the sound of cannon fire -- coming from the Dauntless.
Cannonballs hit the shore; men cry out in anguish.
NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
Men!	Take cover!
The sailors scramble to find refuge --
INT. ISLA DE MUERTA - MAIN CAVERN - NIGHT
Will, guarded by pirates, glares at Jack.
WILL
You've been planning this from the beginning. Since you learned my name.
Jack takes the opportunity to move toward him.
JACK
Oh, please -- did I really seem
that clever?
Before Will can answer, Jack smoothly slips the sword from a Pirate's scabbard -- tosses it to Will, who catches it despite his sursprise.
JACK (CONT'D)
Use it well.
He draws his own sword -- and clobbers the Pirate. Barbossa and the other pirates stare in shock --
BARBOSSA
Confound it, Jack -- I was actually beginning to like you!
Swords are drawn, and the Pirates attack.
Jack and Will take on multiple opponents, each with his own style: Will parries, glissades and dissarms with lightening fast and perfect form, while Jack uses his blade, fists, acrobatics and anything within reach to survive.
118.
EXT. ISLA DE MUERTA - BEACH - NIGHT
The sailors charge. The moon emerges from behind a cloud --
Suddenly an army of SKELETON PIRATES rise up from the sea, and charge the stunned sailors -- several men are struck down --
NORRINGTON
Steady, men! Remember -- we're the Navy!
The sailors recover their nerve, and engage the enemy. It's a full on battle, Royal Navy against Skeleton Pirates --
The Navy men are driven back, surrounded --
Suddenly there is a massive BOOM of cannon fire. Norrington, in the midst of of a swordfight, tries to see --
NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
What is happening out there?
EXT. LAGOON - NIGHT
It's the Black Pearl, manned by Gibbs, AnaMaria and Cotton, and captained by Elizabeth, coming around the point, cannons blazing --
EXT. ISLA DE MUERTA - BEACH - NIGHT
Gillette sees the Black Pearl firing on the Dauntless.
GILLETTE
They're on our side! Take heart, men!
The Royal Navy stand their ground and fight --
INT. CAVE - MAIN CAVERN - NIGHT
Only two pirates left: Barbossa and Jacoby. Jacoby rounds on Will; Barbossa faces off against Jack.
BARBOSSA
Just so you know, Jack -- I don't think you're that clever. I think you're a fool. A mortal fool.
JACK
Remarkable how often those two
traits coincide.
Jack drives him back, making Barbossa laugh.
119.
BARBOSSA
You can't beat me, Jack.
To prove his point, he drops his own sword -- and catches Jack's sword with both hands. Jack can't free it. Barbossa twists the sword from Jack's grip, reverses it --
-- AND DRIVES THE SWORD INTO JACK'S CHEST.
Will battling Jacoby, sees it -- he smashes Jacoby in the jaw, crumpling him.
WILL
Jack!
Jack stares down at the sword jutting from his chest. He takes a few steps backward, toward the Aztec gold -- when he steps into the moonlight, JACK BECOMES SKELETAL.
JACK
Well, isn't that interesting.
Skeleton Jack pulls the sword from his chest. He pulls something from his pocket: one of the Aztec coins.
JACK (CONT'D)
They're so pretty, I just couldn't resist stealing one. It's a curse, I guess.
Barbossa grabs up his sword, and rushes Jack. Both men are in moonlight now, two skeletons in pitched battle.
BARBOSSA
So what now, Jack Sparrow? Are we to be two immortals, locked in epic battle until the trumpets of Judgement Day?
JACK
Or you could surrender.
He shoves Barbossa back, out of the moonlight. Barbossa stalks the room, his attention focused on Jack.
BARBOSSA
Or I could chain you to a
cannonball and drop you in the
deepest part of the ocean, where
you can contemplate your folly
forever.
Barbossa charges --
120.
A SHOT RINGS OUT --
Jack stands out of the moonlight, flesh and blood again, holding his smoking pistol, still aimed at Barbossa.
BARBOSSA
Hah. Ten years you carried that pistol, and you end up wasting your shot.
WILL
He didn't waste it.
Will stands over the Aztec chest, holding a bloody sword, his left hand in a fist. He opens the fist --
--	the medallion, blood covering it, drops from his hand, revealing the cut in his palm.
Barbossa stares, then looks down at his chest. Blood blossoms on his shirt around the bullet hole. It spreads quickly.
Barbossa clutches his chest, his face registering pain for the first time in years. Barbossa falls heavily to the ground, dead.
Jack blows the smoke from the barrel of his pistol ... 
tosses it away.
EXT. ISLA DE MUERTA - BEACH - NIGHT
Murtogg FIRES a pistol at a pirate. The pirate is hit, screams in pain, and crumples to the ground. Mullroy runs through another pirate with a sword.
The pirates react to the sight, and quickly realize their peril. They set their weapons down in surrender.
EXT. ISLA DE MUERTA - LAGOON - NIGHT
The Black Pearl comes alongside the Dauntless, and Jack's crew swarm across, overwhelming the pirates.
The sailors on the beach see it, and CHEER.
INT. ISLA DE MUERTA - CAVE - MAIN CAVERN - NIGHT
Will wraps a cloth around his palm; Jack joins him near the chest.
WILL
Well, you're the worst pirate I've ever heard of.
121.
(smiles)
You're a man who can be trusted,
who can be counted on, and who
can't betray his friends.	What
kind of pirate is that?
JACK
(admits it)
The worst.
(beat)
On the other hand, maybe I'm a man who can't pass up a chance for revenge against the black-hearted bastard who stole my ship and left me to die in the middle of the ocean -- twice! -- and who knows how to get what he wants. Now that's a great pirate.
Jack cuts his palm, grips the coin he stole above the chest ...  and then hesitates.
Will looks at him ... 
Jack releases the coin. It lands in the chest beside the other bloody coin.
Suddenly, the lid of the chest, all on its own, SLAMS SHUT.
Elizabeth stares at it.
WILL
Let's get out of here.
EXT. ISLA DE MUERTA - BEACH - NIGHT - LATER
Jack, Will and Norrington gather together on the beach.
Elizabeth calls out:
ELIZABETH
You're all right!
The three men turn as one. An awkward moment -- which of them does she mean?
Elizabeth races across the sand, toward them -- and straight to Will. She throws her arms around his neck in a hug.
WILL
Miss Swann -- are you wearing trousers? And how did you get off the island?
Elizabeth can't believe that's what he noticed. Indignant, she steps away from him.
122.
ELIZABETH
Yes, I am wearing trousers. And as for how we got off the island -- ah, that's a grand adventure, but now is not the time to talk about it.
She reaches a hand behind his neck, decisively kisses him.
ELIZABETH (CONT’D) There. And don't you dare tell me that wasn't a proper kiss!
WILL
Elizabeth, I think it doesn't matter that we are of a different class --
ELIZABETH
It doesn't!
WILL
--	but that was not a proper kiss. Pure consternation on Elizabeth's face --
WILL (CONT'D)
This is a proper kiss.
Will sweeps her in his arms, leans her back, and kisses her long and well --
Jack puts a hand on Norrington's shoulder.
JACK
Tough luck.	I was rooting for you.
EXT. PORT ROYAL - FORT CHARLES - DAY
Close on: Will's face, stoic, staring forward. He stands straight and unmoving. Around him are members of the Royal Navy, standing before for a group of witnesses from town.
It is the courtyard on top of Fort Charles. A trial is underway -- with Will as the defendant.
NORRINGTON
...  and though I do say so with
regret, the law is clear.	The
penalty for piracy is death by
hanging.
In the crowd, Elizabeth squeezes the hand of her father, Swann. She lets go as Swann stands.
123.
SWANN
By your leave, I wish to speak on behalf of the boy.
(a glance at Elizabeth)
It is clear that these deeds were performed out of a sincere desire to do good, at great personal risk. It seems to me, that in rare occasion where the right course is committing an act of piracy, then an act of piracy is the right course!
(cheers of approval)
So in my capacity as Governor, I
intend to grant a pardon to --
GILLETTE
Sir!
All eyes turn. Gillette stands at the top of a stairway.
GILLETTE (CONT'D)
Jack and his crew have escaped!
(gasps from the crowd)
There was no damage to the cell ... 
they must have been set free.
Will and Elizabeth exchange looks. You? Not me, you? No, not me either! Swann notices something on the parapet, points --
SWANN
The Black Pearl!
People rush to the parapet. Sure enough, below in the bay are the distinctive black sails of the Pearl. The ship cuts through the waters very close to the point --
--	where the gallows of the pirates are. Suddenly Jack appears, on the point; he swings off the one empty gallows, across and down onto the ship's rigging as it passes.
GILLETTE
Sir!	Shall I break out the
cannons?
NORRINGTON
I don't think that will be
necessary.
Norrington raises his hand ...  twirls a key on his finger.
NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
A day's head start. That's all he gets.
124.
Will, Elizabeth and Swann look out toward the ocean --
EXT. BLACK PEARL - STERN DECK - DAY
Jack monkeys down the rigging. AnaMaria is at the wheel.
ANAMARIA
Capatin Sparrow -- the Black Pearl is yours!
Jack runs a hand lovingly along the rail, then takes the wheel. It feels good -- right -- in his hands. He enjoys it, and then shifts to 'Captain' mode.
JACK
AnaMaria, trim the mainsail!
ANAMARIA
Aye, aye, sir!
JACK
Mr. Gibbs, organize a cleaning detail -- you and Cotton. I want every inch of the Pearl spic-and-span and ship-shape!
Gibbs actually stomps the deck, executes a salute.
Jack stands at the wheel: he's got his ship back, and all is right with the world. He begins to unconsciously hum: "Yo, ho, yo, ho, a pirate's life for me ... "
He realizes what he's doing and smiles, the orchestra takes over as the Black Pearl sails for uncharted waters ...  and we FADE UP large words in script
