HEARTBEATS OVER BLACK...


INT. ARENA - CONCERT - NIGHT

Various shots of teenage girls with stars in their eyes screaming their heads off.

CROWD
CON-NER! CON-NER! CON-NER!

A THX-like sound and futuristic CHURCH-INSPIRED GRAPHIC fills the massive LED screens. A voice booms through the arena represented by a HAL-like graphic.

DEEP VOICE (V.O.)
Do you, conner4real, vow to love and cherish your fans for all your days?

A silhouette of CONNER4REAL appears on the screen.

CONNER (ON SCREEN)
I do.

The audience screams.

DEEP VOICE (V.O.)
Do you promise to be yourself and

to never stop telling the truth?

CONNER (ON SCREEN)
You know I do.

The crowd swoons.

DEEP VOICE (V.O.)
And do you, conner4real, promise to rock the muthafuckin’ house?

CONNER4REAL (Andy Samberg) appears on the giant LED screen. He is Bieber, Drake, Macklemore, Katy Perry and Kanye all rolled into one.

CONNER (ON SCREEN)
(smug)

I thought you’d never ask, trick!

Conner throws a HAMMER across the LED screens, until it “smashes” into the HAL graphic, EXPLOSION. Bass hits and FIREWORKS BLAST and the crowd goes apeshit.

SMASH CUT TO:

EXT. ARENA - EARLIER THAT DAY

FANS wait in line. A group of TEEN GIRLS in conner4real T-Shirts with handmade signs, etc.

DIRECTOR’S VOICE (O.S.)

you?

Being 4 real just means being yourself/ Yeah and like, just do you and don’t sweat all the haters.

Conner is one of the hardest working people I’ve ever met. He’s a perfectionist.


INT. ARENA - REHEARSAL - DAY

Conner rehearses a MAGIC WARDROBE CHANGE with his DANCERS. The fabric tube drops and his clothes are wedged in his crotch. Conner yelps in pain.

CONNER
Again!

QUICK CUTS - Conner in pain as the trick malfunctions.

CONNER (CONT’D)
Ow! It’s catching again! Hold on, maybe if I tuck my stuff between my legs.

He reaches down and tucks his junk between his legs (OS).

CONNER (CONT’D)
Alright, again!

The trick works revealing Conner in a SEQUINNED SUIT.

CONNER (CONT’D)

TALKING HEAD - PAULA (late 20’s), sharp, super sarcastic, very “over it”, is being interviewed.

L/3: “PAULA KLEIN: CONNER’S PUBLICIST”

PAULA
Gaga has her “Little Monsters”,
Justin Bieber has the “Beliebers”,
Katy Perry has the “Katy Kats”.

Conner4real has his “Connfidants”.

CONNER
What’s up my connfidants? So I just cut my big toenail, it’s looking pretty good, pretty smooth.

TALKING HEAD - HARRY

HARRY
At first I didn’t get it. He was
brushing his teeth, feeding his
turtle and shit. But, the fans
loved it. And that’s Conner’s
magic, he sees things that other
people don’t.

UNDER THE COVERS - Conner whispers.

NICKI MINAJ (CONT’D)
I was like, “who is this bitch-ass dude sobbing in my face?” But I also couldn’t take my eyes off it. Like this beautiful trainwreck, y’know? And that’s when I decided to fuck him.


INT. ELLEN DEGENERES SHOW - TV BROADCAST

Conner and Ellen are mid chat.

ELLEN DEGENERES
Okay last question, where does the name “conner4real” come from?

CONNER
Hoooo. That’s a long story... Obviously I’m Conner. That’s where that part comes from, but to be for real? That’s a life choice. A proclamation of truthfulness to the universe.

ELLEN DEGENERES
Right. And your name is Conner
Friel. Conner Friel-Conner4real. It

works.

The audience laughs.

CONNER
Ha! That too. You got jokes, Ellen!


INT. ARENA - UNDER THE STAGE - NIGHT

SLO-MO - WE FOLLOW CONNER in the catacombs beneath the stage.

HARRY (V.O.)
We’re all on this crazy ride with

him, y’know?

HARRY (V.O.)
And it feels like it’s just getting started.

PHOTO of 5 YEAR-OLD Conner, Owen, and LAWRENCE (another little boy) dressed like three Pinocchios for Halloween.

TILLY
There’s little Owen, who is now
Conner’s DJ. Lawrence, looking
grumpy even back then. And my

Connie. They were inseparable.


EXT. LITTLE LEAGUE GAME - GRAINY HOME VIDEO - DAY

YOUNG CONNER (10) hits the ball deep, Owen and Lawrence score runs, winning the game.

TILLY (V.O.)
Even back then, it was always about the music.

While the rest of the team celebrates, Conner, Owen and Lawrence do a CHOREOGRAPHED DANCE and RAP to the crowd.

INT. CONNER’S CHILDHOOD HOME - HALLWAY - DAY

HARRY
My wife, Diane, was working as a music teacher at Sacramento High School and told me there were some kids there I had to see.

BACK IN THE VIDEO - The camera finds a YOUNGER HARRY and YOUNGER DIANE watching the Boyz.

HARRY (V.O.)
I had never thought about being a music manager before, but there was something special happening on that stage. Kinda like Boys II Men or Jodeci but way whiter. And they rapped too.

ON THE STAGE - They are rapping profanities. Etc.

HARRY
Back in my high school days I’d had a similar opportunity I should’ve taken but didn’t. My jazz band, “Tony! Toni! Tone! Tonee!” was ready to take off when I quit due to creative differences.

INSERT - An old Tony! Toni! Tone! photo with Harry added to it. MUSIC - An instrumental jazz version of “It Never Rains”.

HARRY (CONT’D)
They wanted to go in an R&B
direction, I wanted to stick with
Jazz. In hindsight, it wasn’t my
best decision, I ended up dead

broke, but it led me to the boys.

RESUME - TILLY IN HALLWAY - she points to a GOLD RECORD.

TILLY
Harry signed them right after graduation, they became the “Drama Boyz” and just took off.


I/E. MUSIC VIDEO - DRAMA BOYZ - “DONKEY ROLL”

TALKING HEAD - TILLY

TILLY
All of a sudden my little boy was
out in the world, and he hasn’t

really been home since.

She sighs and smiles, it’s bittersweet.

CUT TO:


EXT. REHEARSAL SPACE - MORNING

Harry is walking up to the front door with COFFEE AND BAGELS.

HARRY (V.O.)
It’s a pretty exciting time.
Conner’s second solo album,
CONNquest, drops in two weeks, and
then it’s off to a world tour. All

the pieces are to coming together.


INT. REHEARSAL SPACE - DAY

Conner, ENTOURAGE and DANCERS, all lounge and work.

PAULA enters, Conner notices.

CONNER
(playful)

Look who’s come crawlin’ back.

PAULA
Nice to see you too, Conner.

TALKING HEAD - HARRY

HARRY
Paula is Conner’s publicist but she actually started as my intern.

HOME VIDEO FOOTAGE - The five of them, all with bad hair and clothing, having a blast together. Loading up a van.

TALKING HEAD - PAULA

PAULA
I was double-majoring English Lit
and Drama at Berkeley when Harry

hired me and it just kinda stuck.

HOME VIDEO FOOTAGE -
 
11.


-	HOTEL ROOM - Conner and Owen do a dance routine on the bed, Harry laughs and Paula tries to do homework.

-	AT A ROAD SIDE DINER - Pigging out, excited about the road.

PAULA (CONT’D)
Eventually I settled in as Conner's
publicist, which it turned out I'm
quite good at. So now I travel a

lot for multiple clients.

BACK AT THE REHEARSAL SPACE -

Conner stretches with the dancers, Paula is on her laptop.

CONNER
Yo, Paula, who do you rep now?

Anybody bigger than me?

PAULA
Literally all of them. They’re all bigger and they’re all better looking.

CONNER
That is some heartless shit right

there. You’re a bully.

PAULA
I feel comfortable bullying you

because you’re so insignificant.

Harry enters, followed by ROADIES wheeling in something big covered with a tarp.

CONNER
There it is!

HARRY
Hello, everyone! All eyes on me.
Tupac ref. We have a big

announcement.

Everyone gathers.

CONNER
Alright, we know the industry isn’t what it used to be. To sell records now you have to be on that next shit. Beyonce had her surprise album, Jay-Z came out exclusively on Samsung, Barry Smalls dropped his album, literally, out of a hot air balloon.
 
12.


SPONGE/EDDIE
I caught one of those/ So dope.

CONNER
So I’m happy to announce that we have secured a major brand partner. The CONNquest tour and album, will be sponsored by: Aquaspin Appliances!

He pulls off the tarp revealing a WASHER/DRYER combo with a big tour banner. “CONNER4REAL: THE CONNQUEST TOUR brought to you by Aquaspin©”

CONNER (CONT’D)
We takin’ over, ya’ll!

Everyone cheers. Except Owen, who looks skeptical.

CUT TO:


EXT. AQUASPIN HEADQUARTERS - DAY

Nice cooperate headquarters with a sign.

WALLY (O.S.)
Right this way, gentleman!


INT. AQUASPIN SHOWROOM - CONTINUOUS

An Aquaspin Executive, WALLY, dressed in khakis and polo, shows Conner, Owen, Sponge, Eddie and Harry around.

L/3: “WALLY BATES: SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, AQUASPIN”

WALLY
You guys are gonna love this.
(Tracy Flick, Waspy)

Welcome to the future, bitches!

She opens a REFRIGERATOR and a conner4real SONG plays out of a shitty speaker in the door. She dances to it.

WALLY (CONT’D)
Fresh right? We can upload your
whole album to our fridges,
washer/dryers, blenders and

microwaves across the country!

CONNER
So sick.
 
13.


OWEN
You can do that?

WALLY
Appliances are all digital now, my man. Built wifi right into those little fuckers for upgrades and shit. We can send anything we want.

CONNER
What did I tell ya’ll?! Wally’s a

genius!

Wally opens and shuts the fridge and the MUSIC TURNS ON AND OFF. Sponge and Eddie are impressed, Owen less.

AT A BLENDER - Wally turns it on, the music can barely be heard over the motor. They shout over it.

WALLY
AQUASPIN APPLIANCES ARE IN 98
PERCENT OF AMERICAN HOMES. I’M

TALKIN’ FULL MARKET SATURATION!

OWEN
ISN’T IT KINDA ANNOYING TO LISTEN

THIS WAY?

WALLY
NAW MAN! IT’S LIKE A DUBSTEP REMIX!
(pushing buttons)

SHRED! PULSE! LIQUIFY!

Conner joins her.

WALLY/CONNER
SHRED! PULSE! LIQUIFY! SHRED!
PULSE! LIQUIFY! Yo, that could

really be a song!

CUT TO:


INT. AQUASPIN HEADQUARTERS - DAY

Conner and Owen walk out the front door.

OWEN
(excited, laughing)

Okay, I’m sorry, but that shit was retarded! I mean who would want to listen to music that way? Right?
 
14.


CONNER
Yo, I know it’s weird, but you’re not looking at it the right way. If Aquaspin wants to spend millions of dollars to help bring our music to fans, how can Aquaspin be bad?

OWEN
(unconvinced)

Right, I guess that makes sense.


TALKING HEAD - OWEN

OWEN
Sometimes Conner gets an idea and
runs with it. And he’s right like
99% of the time. You gotta just

trust he knows what he’s doing.

The sound of a CROWD takes us TO:


EXT. ARENA - NIGHT

L/3rd: “WARM-UP SHOW. SEATTLE, WASHINGTON”

CONNER (O.S.)
How ya’ll doing out there?!


INT. ARENA - WARM-UP SHOW - CONTINUOUS

Conner is on stage.

CONNER
Ya’ll know my album comes out in 5 days, right! Here’s a new one...

Owen throws on SONG -

CONNER (CONT’D)
Lyrics, lyrics, lyrics...


INT. ARENA - BACKSTAGE - SAME

We hear the bass from the show in the BG as Sponge ushers in a DOZEN HOTTIES.

SPONGE
Right this way, ladies.
 
15.


SPONGE (V.O.)
On tour I’m the party-coordinator, good-time-determinator, in the H-O-U-S-E for two thousand and FREAK.

VARIOUS SHOTS - Sponge sets up the green room, dims lights, puts a tapestry on the couch, fills a bowl with condoms.

SPONGE
I manage the green room facilities and whatnot. Make sure it’s got the right ambiance and chill people.

Sponge leads HOT GIRLS backstage, weeds out a CHUBBY GIRL.

ACROSS THE ROOM - EDDIE, sits on a couch, rolling massive BLUNTS. ZIPPY, a classic roadie, sits next to him.

EDDIE
I’m an idea man for real. I come up with like the weirdest thoughts. Like what if a dog was wearing a cape? That could be a video.

ZIPPY
That would be sick, bro.

DIRECTOR’S VOICE (O.S.)
You make music videos?

EDDIE
I haven’t yet per se, mostly I roll blunts. But it seems like basically the same skill set. I used to kick it with Wiz Khalifa. But I got lost at Bonnaroo and fell asleep in Conner’s dressing room.

PARTY FOOTAGE - EDDIE passed out under a table.

EDDIE (CONT’D)
Wiz left without me and I’ve been

rolling with C-Dot ever since.

ON THE OTHER COUCH - SARAH, beautiful, asymmetrical haircut, bored. Sits on a couch, chewing gum and texting.

L/3rd: “SARAH CHUN: PERSONAL ASSISTANT”

She finally looks up. A beat. Then goes back to texting.

TALKING HEAD - HARRY
 
16.


HARRY
Conner currently has 32 people on

his personal tour payroll.

We see QUICK CUTS of the following CHARACTERS:

HARRY (V.O.)
He has a vocal coach, a basketball coach, an “Ab trainer”, an eyebrow specialist, sneaker jockey. Ice whisperer for his drinking ice. Dry-ice whisperer for grand entrances. Two umbrella wranglers, one for sun one for rain. A dude to roll his weed up, and a dude to hold his weed for him in case they get busted. A scarf caddy. A Perspective Manipulator--

DIRECTOR’S VOICE (O.S.)
What’s a Perspective Manipulator?

HARRY
That’s a guy who’s slightly shorter than Conner that he pays to stand near him at events to make him look taller. He’ll often have him dress like an NBA player to give the impression that he’s very tall.

INSERT - Shots of Conner at events next to the SHORT GUY dressed like an NBA player. In the last one the short guy very poorly spins a basketball on his finger.

CUT TO:


INT. ARENA - WARM-UP CONCERT - LATER

We are now mid-show, but Conner is not on stage.

OWEN
Yo, yo, yo. Stop the music. Where did Conner go? Does anyone see him? Can we get the security cameras on screen please?

ON THE VIDEO WALLS - SECURITY CAM FOOTAGE of empty hallways, backstage, dressing rooms, then

BATHROOM STALL - SECURITY CAM - Conner, pants at his ankles, tries to block the camera. In this well-rehearsed “scene”.
 
17.


CONNER
(bad acting)

Whoa! Get out of here!

OWEN
Conner, whatchu doing man? You got a show to do.

CONNER
When ya gotta go, ya gotta go.

The crowd laughs. Loving this!

CONNER (CONT’D)
For real, this is an invasion of my privacy. You know what, fuck it, I don’t have any secrets from ya’ll.

A wall on stage falls over, revealing Conner on toilet, right in the middle of the stage. The crowd goes nuts.

FLASHBACK TO:


INT. ARENA - REHEARSAL - DAY

Conner is on the toilet rehearsing the same bit.

CONNER
So, the walls come down and I’m

here on the toilet.

OWEN
That’s dope!

CONNER
And like, I think I should kick the first verse with my pants down, from the throne. Then the chorus hits and I’ll stand up like, finished!

Everyone cracks up, “This guy is a visionary”.

VOICE OVER PA (O.S.)
Okay, Conner, let’s take it from

the song. In 3, 2...

Conner raises the mic and we... MATCH CUT TO:
 
18.


INT. ARENA - CONCERT - RESUME

The SONG kicks in and THE TOILET RISES UP OFF THE STAGE ON WIRES WITH CONNER STILL ON IT. He flails his legs around wildly. Dancers hold toilet paper rolls, dance provocatively.

CONNER (V.O.)
It’s about intimacy. If you’re in love with someone you want to share every moment with them, and that’s how I feel about my fans. Plus if I actually need the bathroom I can sneak that in during the song. The toilet IS fully functional.

We see him grimacing a little during the song.


TALKING HEAD - CONNER

CONNER
Perks of the biz, baby!


EXT. REAL 92.3 - MORNING

A BLACK SUV enters the gates, past the AUTOGRAPH HUNTERS.

BIG BOY (O.S.)
Okay, now do I have this right? You are also giving away the album on Aquaspin appliances?


INT. REAL 92.3 - CONTINUOUS

Conner is being interviewed by BIG BOY.

CONNER
Hell yeah. Next Monday at midnight CONNquest drops worldwide but if you’ve got an Aquaspin appliance, it’s streaming free.

BIG BOY
So like, I have an Aquaspin ice
maker. It’s gonna be able to play

your album?

CONNER
Yerp.
 
19.


BIG BOY
That’s some baller-ass future

Jetson’s shizz right there.

CONNER
Yeah man. I want to be the
soundtrack to people’s lives. You
got your cereal, toast, orange
juice, conner4real. Part of your

balanced breakfast.

BIG BOY
Nutritious and delicious, no doubt.

CUT TO:


EXT. EL RAY THEATER - NIGHT

The marquee reads “AQUASPIN PRESENTS: AN EVENING WITH CONNER4REAL.”

RYAN SEACREST (O.S.) Okay, first you’re in a group, the Drama Boyz...


INT. EL RAY THEATER - NIGHT

RYAN SEACREST and Conner sit for a TOWN HALL STYLE Q & A.

RYAN SEACREST
Things are going well, the Donkey Roll is a hit, then your breakout moment: Claudia Cantrell calls and asks you to do a guest verse on her song, Midnight Snack, at the Poppys.

CONNER
Yeah, surreal. I was a huge fan.

RYAN SEACREST
But instead of kicking a verse like everyone else. You did something a little different.

CONNER
Ha, yeah, I had been working on a new catchphrase, but I had so many dope ones that I just wrote a verse of all catchphrases.

CUT TO:
 
20.


INT. POPPYS - TV BROADCAST

CLAUDIA CANTRELL (Lady Gaga) sings the chorus to a song called “MIDNIGHT SNACK” ON THE “POP MUSIC AWARDS” AKA the “Poppys”, it breaks for Conner‘s guest verse:

CLAUDIA CANTRELL
... I’m hungry for you, I want a

midnight snack.

CONNER
Ugh. Yerp. Conner4real. So Real.
Doink d’doink! Wheeeee!!! Hahaha

wipe out! Say whaaaat?!

CUT BACK TO:


INT. EL RAY THEATER - RESUME

RYAN SEACREST
I remember watching, everyone was

like “who is this kid??”.

CONNER
It was wild. The Poppie Awards

changed my whole life.

RYAN SEACREST
So now here comes the girls, the
fame, the endorsements, those

ridiculous superjetjeans ads.

CONNER
Oh no, please don’t show that!

RYAN SEACREST
Oh, we’re showing it. Something

that good must be shared!


INT. SUPERJETJEANS AD -

Like a 90’s Calvin Klein ad. Conner is modeling a super ugly pair of airbrushed jeans. They say “EXIT ONLY” on the butt.

CONNER
Pretty funny, right?

JUMP TO: “TWO WAY STREET” on the butt.

CONNER (CONT’D)
I don’t judge, it’s all love.
 
21.


JUMP TO: “CRAP FACTORY” on the back.

CONNER (CONT’D)
Be original.

CUT BACK TO:


INT. EL RAY THEATER - RESUME

RYAN SEACREST
So you’re red-hot now. And here’s
the offer for a solo contract.

How’d the other guys take it?

CONNER
They took it okay. Owen, Lawrence and I grew up together, we’re like brothers, sometimes brothers fight. But we still love each other.

RYAN SEACREST
You’re referring to the Coachella

incident?

CONNER
I wasn’t, but--

FLASH TO:


EXT. COACHELLA - OLD FOOTAGE

Drama Boyz are on stage.

LAWRENCE
(to crowd)

Coachella, you ready to party with the Drama Boyz?!
(aside to Conner)
I fuckin’ hate you, dude. Back-

stabbing thieving piece of shit!

CONNER
(to crowd)
Let’s see those hands in the air!
(to Lawrence)

Come at me, bro. I’ll fuckin’ beat your ass right now.

OWEN
(to crowd)
Ha ha! Side to side, like this!

(MORE)
 
22.

OWEN (CONT'D)
(aside)

Guys, stop it.

Owen leads the crowd while trying to separate them. Lawrence RUSHES Conner, tackling him to the floor.

CONNER
Ahhh!!!! He’s biting me!!!


BACK IN THE EL REY - SAME TIME

Conner leans over and whispers to Seacrest in the dark as the footage plays behind them.

CONNER
Yo, Seacrest, what’s with all the Drama Boyz questions? I’m trying to sell a record, man.

RYAN SEACREST
I’m just asking what the people

want to know about, Conner.

CONNER
What? Since when did you decide to become a real journalist?

RYAN SEACREST
That’s hurtful. That hurts me.

CONNER
I’ll hurt you.

RYAN SEACREST
Fuckin bring it, flyboy. I rip Soul
Cycle a new asshole EVERY morning.

My shit is TIGHT.

THE FOOTAGE ENDS, lights come back up, they both smile.

CONNER
That was just some growing pains
but I see Owen everyday, he’s my
producer, my DJ, my best-friend.

And Lawrence is a farmer now.

RYAN SEACREST
Lawrence Dunn is a farmer? Man, you really screwed him up, huh?

CONNER
Nope. Not at all. I mean, that was always his dream actually...
 
23.


As they continue to talk a MOODY MUSIC CUE creeps in...


EXT. BIG TIMBER, COLORADO - WINTER - DUSK

We find Lawrence, bushy beard, overalls. Pushing farm equipment.

L/3: “BIG TIMBER, COLORADO”

LAWRENCE (V.O.)
My name is Lawrence Dunn, I was in the Drama Boyz, now I’m a farmer.

Lawrence chops wood. Bottle-feeds a goat.

LAWRENCE
Being out in nature, away from
everyone and all the trappings of

modern life...

Lawrence attempts to fix a frozen water pump, hurts his hand.

LAWRENCE (V.O.)
It’s so peaceful. There’s nothing

like it.

TALKING HEAD - LAWRENCE

LAWRENCE
After the Drama Boyz I tried a solo project, but it didn’t really stick.

MUSIC VIDEO - “LARRY D”, Lawrence rocks a FLUTE.

LAWRENCE (V.O.) (CONT’D) It was a flute concept album. Dr. Dre produced the whole thing and even did a guest verse.

DR. DRE (IN VIDEO)
Listen as he executes the funky
flute/ He can play it and I know

it/ So watch him blow it...

LAWRENCE (V.O.)
I thought it was gonna blow up. But the label didn’t promote it right.

RESUME ON LAWRENCE -
 
24.


LAWRENCE
Then my uncle passed away and left me this farm. I’ve never been happier.

Suddenly, a glob of BIRD SHIT lands on Lawrence’s face. He doesn’t react. Just stares with rage.

CUT TO:


EXT. WAREHOUSE REHEARSAL SPACE - DAY

WE HEAR some synth...


INT. WAREHOUSE REHEARSAL SPACE - DAY

Owen plays a few chords on a synthesizer.

OWEN
You recognize that?

He plays it again, nodding to the groove.

OWEN (CONT’D)
That’s that Doobie Howser. I made
that for Conner’s first album.
(sings)

I’m Doobie Howser M.D./Smokin and solvin mysteries/ Love that record.

DIRECTOR’S VOICE (O.S.)
You make all of Conner’s music?

OWEN
I did on the first album, but
Conner wanted to branch out this
time. So he used a different
producer for every track. To make

an entire album of hot singles.

DIRECTOR’S VOICE (O.S.)
Do you miss performing with the

Drama Boyz?

- ON STAGE - Owen DJing behind Conner.

OWEN
Naw, I know some people think it’s weird cuz we used to be in a group and now I'm playing the background as the DJ but it's not like that. I could never do what he does.

(MORE)
 
25.

OWEN (CONT'D)
I owe Conner everything... And I still get to connect with the audience every night warming up the crowd.

-	ON STAGE - House lights are up. Owen is DJing his heart out while scattered people find their seats.

OWEN (V.O.)
I’m building up my own little fan

base.

ANGLE ON - a few 12 year old GIRLS with KID CONTACT signs.

TIME CUT - Owen plays a drum machine.

DIRECTOR’S VOICE (O.S.) So, you use everything here during the show?

OWEN
During the show? Naw, man. Mostly I just use this.

Owen holds up an old iPod.

OWEN (CONT’D)
It’s an iPod. 60 gigs, so I can easily fit the whole show, plus like, a bunch of dope audio books.

He hits play.

IPOD
It was year three at Hogworts and
Harry was worried it would never

get easier--

Owen nods like “yeah”.

26.


DIRECTOR’S VOICE (O.C.)
So tell us what’s going on.

CONNER
Well, the record comes out tonight at midnight, and the reviews are coming in, aaaaand, not great, not what I was hoping for. Bumming a little bit cuz Pitchfork gave it a negative review.

DIRECTOR’S VOICE (O.C.)
They didn’t like it.

CONNER
No, like the number was a Negative 4. Out of ten...

WE SEE A STILL OF THE REVIEW: “-4/10”

CONNER (CONT’D)
So that stings a little bit. Cuz that’s like UNDER zero. Almost seems just spiteful or something. But it’s an improvement in a lot ways over Rolling Stone, which just gave it, like, the shit emoji.

WE SEE A STILL OF THE REVIEW: “the shit emoji”

CONNER (CONT’D)
Out of four stars I guess. Which is you know, not useful, but that said, I think that’s the first time anyone’s gotten that score. So in a way, we already makin’ history! Ha.


INT. CONNER’S WOODLAND HILLS ESTATE - KITCHEN - LATER

Conner, Harry, Paula, Owen are eating. Sponge and Eddie too.

HARRY
Man, fuck the reviews. The moment you get popular the reviews go bad.

PAULA
Pitchfork’s important online, but

it’s reach is pretty limited.

CONNER
It’s like they’re mad the last album was so big. Trying to say my songs are “out of touch”.
 
27.


EVERYONE
Out of touch?!/ Crazy/ What songs?

CONNER
(incredulous)

“Should I Move”

SPONGE/EDDIE
What?!/ Shit’s classic!

ASHLEY

They immediately start making out. At first people are like awwww, But then it keeps going, becoming awkward...

ASHLEY (CONT’D)
I want you right now.

CONNER
(scared/excited)

Oh shit, for real?

She leads him off into the bathroom.

TALKING HEAD - ASHLEY & CONNER

CONNER (CONT’D)
We’ve been hanging out for about 6 months and I gotta say, Ashley is the total package.

ASHLEY
Aww.

CONNER
Smart, funny, and such a big heart.

Just a beautiful soul.

Ashley fake blushes.

ASHLEY
When I was little, I used to spend hours looking at famous couples in Us Weekly and Star magazine.
Everyone speculating, “Are they a real couple? Or is it just for publicity?” I knew when I grew up I wanted to be one of those couples.
 
30.


INT. “EXTRA” - TV BROADCAST

Golden God, MARIO LOPEZ, does his “thang” in front of a poster for a Hunger Games style movie “Cube Theorem”.

PAPARAZZI FOOTAGE - Conner and Ashley, leave a club, kiss for cameras. The kissing gets more intense, they start undressing each other and are clearly going to have sex in front of everyone until Paula runs in and stops them.

-	At The Ivy in Beverly Hills, the same thing happens in the middle of the restaurant, Paula runs in to stop them.

-	At a CHARITY EVENT FOR KIDS they start hooking up again, Paula runs in again.

BACK TO THE PARTY -

Sponge and Eddie guard the bathroom door, Paula stands bored.
WE HEAR the muffled sounds of Conner and Ashley HAVING SEX.

CONNER/ASHLEY (O.S.) Holy shit, this feels so good! I’m so blessed!/ I’m so blessed/ We’re so blessed!

ASHLEY (O.S.)
Ugh, I love your music!

CONNER (O.S.)
You’re acting is so fucking good!

I’m a fan!

ASHLEY (O.S.)
I’m a fan of yours!

Harry walks up.

HARRY
It’s almost midnight.

SPONGE
Maybe we should knock?
 
31.


PAULA
No. They’re about to finish.

HARRY
How do you know?

PAULA
(re: her phone)

Conner just tweeted it...

EDDIE
And then Ashley re-tweeted it.

Paula shows Harry her phone.

HARRY

Hashtag: pulling out.

EDDIE
Hashtag: get a towel. Dope.

Eddie and Sponge slap a low five.

PAULA
This is my life.

Almost instantly Conner and Ashley exit the bathroom, fully dressed and composed.

CONNER
(oblivious)

Sup, guys?

PAULA
Care to re-join your party?

CONNER
We were just talking.

Ashley laughs. Paula drags Conner back to the party.

I’m so embarrassed.

TALKING HEAD - CONNER & ASHLEY
 
32.


DIRECTOR’S VOICE (O.S.)
You’re apart so much, are you

monogamous?

They laugh.

CONNER
Damn, straight to the point, man.

ASHLEY
We don’t like to put labels on it.

CONNER
Yeah, Ashley’s on her movie, I got my shit going on. When we’re together, then we’re together, we don’t worry about the rest.

OVER ON STAGE - Harry gets control of the mic, feedback.

HARRY
Well, it’s been a crazy two years
but Connquest is finally here.
Conner, you’re the most talented
person I’ve ever met. Thanks for
including me on your journey.
Ladies and Gentlemen, my one and
only client, conner4real.

EVERYONE

They cheer, then the POWER DIMS, FLICKERS... THEN GOES OUT.

CUT TO:
 
33.


INT. ANDERSON COOPER 360 - TV BROADCAST

ANDERSON COOPER
If you were one of the millions who experienced a blackout at midnight, no need to call your power company. Instead an angry call to Galaxy Records would be more appropriate. Last night, pop star, conner4real’s new album “CONNquest” was released on, and this is not an error, Aquaspin appliances.

NEWS FOOTAGE - TEENAGERS dancing in front of their appliances. The lights flicker and go out.

ANDERSON COOPER (CONT’D) Millions of unsuspecting Americans turned on their toasters and opened their fridges to find they had become de-facto jukeboxes. And the power grid simply could not handle the surge.

NEWS FOOTAGE - ANNOYED CITIZENS pile their broken appliances in front of Aquaspin headquarters.

ANDERSON COOPER (CONT’D) Hard to believe even a record company would stoop so low, but then again these are strange days.

CUT TO:


EXT. LOS ANGELES SKYLINE - SUNRISE

The sun burns orange around the edges of buildings downtown.


EXT. CONNER’S WOODLAND HILLS ESTATE - BACKYARD - MORNING

Harry sets up breakfast on a patio, is interviewed.

HARRY
So, the overnight numbers aren’t really where we’d like them to be, but, it’s still too early to jump to any conclusions. You know, some people are saying the Aquaspin thing was an invasion of their privacy, so it’s a little speed bump, nothing big.
 
34.


DIRECTOR’S VOICE (O.S.)
How’s Conner feeling?

HARRY
Don’t worry about Conner. Conner’s good. Conner’s always good. That’s his superpower, pure confidence.

ANGLE ON - Conner is getting his HAIRCUT, while Sponge does a funny dance.

CONNER
(chanting)

That’s that shit, that’s that shit!

HARRY (V.O.)
The house could burn down and he would be like, “who cares, we’ll have a new one tomorrow,” and he’d be right. With Conner, shit just works out.

PARTY MUSIC TAKES US TO:


INT. CONNER’S WOODLAND HILLS ESTATE - HOUSE PARTY - NIGHT

A TURTLE RACE. Two turtles on race down a turtle race track.
The PARTY CROWD is cheering wildly.

CONNER
Come on, Maximus! You got this!

LIL WAYNE is cheering for his turtle.

LIL WAYNE
Get it Boots! Get it!

Maximus crosses the finish line.

CONNER
Hell yeah!!

Conner holds Maximus up for everyone.

CONNER (CONT’D)
Are you not entertained?!

TALKING HEAD - CONNER

Conner holds Maximus.
 
35.


CONNER (CONT’D)
This is my best friend Maximus. My mom bought him for me when I was 7, after my dad died.

FOOTAGE - Conner and Maximus watching Gladiator.

CONNER (V.O.)
As a hatchling he was diagnosed with soggy bones syndrome and they said he would be dead within 6 months.

- Conner and Maximus at the VETERINARIAN.

CONNER (V.O.)
But that was over 20 years ago and he’s still here. He’s a champion.

BACK TO THE PARTY - Lil Wayne and Conner feed their turtles.

CONNER
Maximus smashes on all kinds of
crickets.
(to Maximus)

Don’cha buddy?

LIL WAYNE
Boots is a vegetarian. He don’t

fuck with crickets.

CONNER
That’s dope.

JUMP TO - Later in the party, Conner confides in Owen.

CONNER (CONT’D)
Dude, you like the album, right?

OWEN
Of course, the promotion just got
fucked up, but shit does not
matter. All that matters is the

music. And the music is good.

CONNER
It is, right?

OWEN
Fuck yes! There’s multiple hits on there. We just gotta work it like the last album. So I was thinking--

Eddie and Sponge join them, interrupting Owen.
 
36.


EDDIE
Haha, yeah! Con-man killin’ it with with the Aquaspin shit!

SPONGE
I heard 40 million people heard that shit before the blackout? Michael Jackson Thrillers numbers!

EDDIE
Genius, my dude! You on some next level mind boggle shit! But you know what, I got the idea to take our shit to even the nexter level.

CONNER
Hit me.

EDDIE
Peep this shit: First, we get a building in like, a shopping district. Fix it up real nice. A pleasant atmosphere. Then, we download your album, burn it on like a million CDs, Kinkos a cover on top. Have the record label do that part. Shelves. CDs. Other people’s CDs too. Sell em. It would be like going into the internet. But in a physical experience--

OWEN
Eddie, are you just describing a

record store?

EDDIE
A what? No man, I’m talking about

the internet, but in real life.

SPONGE
So, I’d buy the CD there and then

listen to it how?

EDDIE
On a CD player.

SPONGE
Tight!

CONNER
Yo, I like where you guys are going with this keep the brainstorm going and I’ma call Ashley.
