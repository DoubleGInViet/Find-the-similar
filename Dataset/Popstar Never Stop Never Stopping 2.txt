Conner exits, Eddie takes a huge drag from a joint.

OWEN
So where do you picture us putting this “not a record store”?

EDDIE
Oh dude, Conner’s gone. We don’t

need to do all that.	Hit this?

Owen shakes his head and takes the joint.

38.


TYRUS (V.O.)
Hello my name is Tyrus Quash, I do the tour food service for Conner.

Tyrus shows the camera some of the snacks.

TYRUS
These are carrots 8 ways. Sliced.
Natural. Baby. Green parts left on.
(he holds one up)

These are my favorite, they look like little coins. And when Conner eats them he is like a juke box, and later on songs come out.

FOOTAGE - CONNER is grazing the food table, WE ZOOM PAST to find TYRUS, peeking nervously through a doorway.

TYRUS (V.O.)
Conner is very specific when it
comes to food and it brings me
great joy to see him enjoying the

treats I prepare.

CONNER picks up a snack and absentmindedly takes a bite.

TYRUS sighs/grins with relief, pride and joy all at once.


INT. ARENA - BACKSTAGE - LATER

Everyone gathers for the pre-show huddle.

CONNER
Lotta people hating right now but

we feed off their hate.

SLO-MO - Conner walking in a backstage tunnel into a light.

CONNER (CONT’D)
This our prime. I don’t know about you, but I hear thousands fans out there chanting for US. We ain’t done yet! This is what we do! Confident on 3. 1, 2, 3.

EVERYONE
CONFIDENT!


INT. ARENA - ON STAGE - CONCERT

CLOSE - A 1950’S MICROPHONE.
 
39.


Then OWEN leans into it. He is wearing a barbershop quartet outfit and “Aquaspin” hat.

OWEN
Do, do, do, wa, wa, wa...

His sounds become the beat to “I’M SO HUMBLE”, a song where Conner brags about how humble he is. Adam Levine joins them?

The stage/wardrobe/dancers are 50’s drive-thru diner.

1 TO 2 MINUTES.


INT. ARENA - ON STAGE - LATER IN THE SHOW

Conner does some crowd work.

CONNER
Ya’ll have been so amazing!
Everyone in the front, lemme hear

you make some noise!!!

LIGHTS GO UP on the crowd in front as they go crazy.

CONNER (CONT’D)
Now everyone on the sides, I see

you, make some noise!!!

LIGHTS GO UP on the people on the sides as they go crazy.

CONNER (CONT’D)
Now all my people on the upper
deck, waaay at the top. I didn’t

forget ya’ll. Make some noise!

LIGHTS GO UP on the upper deck, it’s EMPTY. Except for one LAME ASS DUDE.

LAME ASS DUDE
YEEAAAAHHHH!!!! I LOVE YOU, CONNER!

Conner stares, dumbfounded.

CONNER (V.O.)
What the hell, Harry?!

CUT TO:


INT. ARENA - BACKSTAGE - LATER

Conner and Harry are getting into it while Sponge, Eddie, Sarah and Owen are on the couches around them.
 
40.


HARRY
Okay, first off, this is an 18,000
seat arena. No one sells this out.

You sold 15,000. That’s still good.

CONNER
No it’s not. Drake sold this out

four times last week.

HARRY
Yeah, that’s true. And Aquaspin is concerned with ticket sales actually.

CONNER
What? But, it’s an 18,000 seat

arena, no one sells that out!

HARRY
Drake did. Four times last week. Look, the low sales, and the fact that we don’t have a record in stores is making Aquaspin nervous, they want to make a change.

CONNER
Like what?

HARRY
They wanna put an opening act on

the tour.

CONNER
We already have an opening act,

Owen DJs.

OWEN
What if we do Drama Boyz as the

opener?

CONNER
Drama Boyz? People don’t want that old shit.

OWEN
It’s never too late for a classic. People are always blowing up my twitter about us doing Donkey Roll.

CONNER
(incredulous)
Yeah? How many followers do you

have?
 
41.


OWEN
Like five hundred thousand.

CONNER
Well, I’ve got 20 million and

nobody asks me that.

Sponge and Eddie laugh.

SPONGE/EDDIE
Ahhh haa!/Clownin’!

HARRY
All the same, we gotta get an

opener.

CONNER
Ugh, fine. Who’d you have in mind?

A HARD-ASS BEAT takes US TO:


INT. SMALL VENUE - NIGHT

HARRY, CONNER, OWEN, SPONGE, EDDIE - watch from a side-stage area.

HUNTER SONG - “HUNTER THE HUNGRY GON’ EAT” - a grimy hip-hop track about how “bizarre” and unique Hunter sees himself.

HUNTER (CONT’D)
Fuck a chorus, fuck my dad, fuck my mom, fuck this song/ Seriously though fuck this song...

HUNTER (CONT’D)
Alright, I’m bored! Show’s over! Go the fuck home!

Hunter drops the mic and joins our guys on the side of the stage. The crowd cheers for more in the BG.

HUNTER (CONT’D)
Awwww holy shit I can’t believe it.

Conner4real is in the building!!

Hunter shakes Conner’s hand. Genuinely excited.

HUNTER (CONT’D)
CONNQUEST was my shit, man. I’m so
honored you’re here.
(spots Owen)

Aaahh!! Kid Contact! You’re my idol man. Those beats, crazy. I make beats too. Holy shit. Drama boyz!

OWEN

Hunter turns to Eddie and Sponge.

HUNTER
Aww fuck. These muthafuckas.

He gives them big daps, turns back to Conner.

HUNTER (CONT’D)
For real, this is my dream come

true. I won’t let you down.

CROWD
Hun-ter! Hun-ter! Hun-ter!

HUNTER

Hunter runs back on stage.

CROWD

Fuck conner4real!

 
Conner is super uncomfortable, but desperately trying to look like he is cool with this.

HUNTER (CONT’D)
Come out here, Conner! Take your

licks, bitch!

Conner walks out, the crowd goes nuts. He joins the chant...

CONNER/HUNTER
Fuck conner4real! Fuck conner4real!

Conner smiles, feeling cooler than he has in a while. Harry nods his approval.

PAULA
Paula, Conner’s publicist.

HUNTER
Well, Paula, may I just say that

you are very beautiful.

PAULA
No, you may not.

HUNTER
You’re strong in your convictions

and I like that.

CONNER
Hey, hey, no. Paula’s off limits.

HUNTER
She is?

PAULA
I am?

CONNER
Yeah. We all work together guys, and you know the famous saying, “co-workers on tour shant be fucking.”
 
45.


PAULA
I have heard that famous saying.

CONNER
Let’s keep it professional here.

ON TV - Hunter wins, a CARTOON WOMAN dressed as a slutty chef leans forwards showing her CARTOON CLEAVAGE.

Yooooo, what is this crazy shit???

- GAS STATION - The helmet is propped on crates.

CONNER
Oh dude, that’s your new head! I had it specially made for you! Took your head measurements while you were asleep. It’s on some futuristic, EDM, DeadMau5, DJ Tommy Pizza shit!

Conner flips a switch and NEON LIGHTS make the head look like a helmet from Tron. It buzzes loudly.

OWEN
Wow.	That’s really... bright.

CONNER
Right?	You’re gonna look so tight!

OWEN
Yeah, totally. People won’t really see my face though.

CONNER
Owen, I just want to give the fans the best show possible and this is the hot shit right now.

Hunter is drinking a beer off to the side.

HUNTER
Helmet’s dope. It looks like the

tip of Optimus Prime’s dick.
 
47.


CONNER
See? Don’t you wanna look like

Optimus Prime?

OWEN
His dick?

HUNTER
Fuck yeah.

CONNER
It’s creating mystery. “Who’s that dude hidden in the giant helmet?”

OWEN
(buying in)
Alright, I guess, if it helps the

show, I can make it work.

CONNER/HUNTER
(rapping)
You’ve been struck by the two

banditos!

CONNER
Gracias, Miami! Buenos noches!

CLOSE UP - A bottle of champagne is POPPED.

Ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank you all for a great show and tell you that for the last 8 shows in a row we were... SOLD OUT!!!

Everyone one CHEERS.

JUMP TO - Everyone parties. Harry talks with Conner and Owen.

HARRY (CONT’D)
We’re on a roll, baby.

CONNER
I know. Gotta be helping album

sales, right?

HARRY
Eh, you know how these things are, it takes a while for the marketplace to catch up. We just need to keep doing good work.

OWEN
Definitely helping Hunter. Dude’s

album just went gold.

Harry shoots Owen at look.

CONNER
Gold? That can’t be right. We

haven’t even gone gold yet.
 
50.


HARRY
He’s having a moment. Don’t worry

about it, plenty to go around.

Conner looks concerned, downs a shot and glares at...

HUNTER across the club, everyone laughs at his antics...


INT. ARENA - STAGE - NIGHT

Conner is performing.

CONNER
I’m on my white boy shit tonight!

DANCERS cover him with the MAGIC WARDROBE CHANGE tube.

POOF! His tracksuit turns into a TUX.

POOF! His tux turns into a SEQUINNED SUIT.

CONNER (CONT’D)
Ladies, this isn’t really my color.

POOF! His sequinned suit is turned into a--

CONNER IS BUTT-NAKED, JUNK TUCKED LIKE BUFFALO BILL IN SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.

THE BAND slowly notices, MUSIC STOPS.

The fans are SHOCKED.

Conner is terrified, drops his mic. He looks down:

WIDE REVEAL - IT LOOKS LIKE HE HAS NO DICK.

Every cell phone in the house starts snapping pics.

CONNER (CONT’D)
(unamplified yells)
No! It’s tucked! It’s tucked! I

tuck it back for the trick!!!

It’s too late, everyone is taking pics. No one can hear him.

CONNER (CONT’D)
Don’t post those! You guys, don’t

post those pics!!!
 
51.


ANGLE ON - OWEN, lost in his helmet.

OWEN
Give it up for my man conner4real!

He stumbles and FALLS OFF THE STAGE.

CUT TO:


INT. ARENA - BACKSTAGE - MOMENTS LATER

Conner paces in a robe, his crew sits. Hunter is loving it.

HUNTER
Holy shit, dude where the fuck was your dick?!

CONNER
What happened with the trick? How

did that happen?

HARRY
It’s okay, no one really saw

anything.

CONNER
I wish they had! 10 thousand people think I don’t have a dick!

They don’t know how to respond.

CONNER (CONT’D)
(desperate)

You guys know I have a dick, right?

EVERYONE
(faking it)

No doubt/ Hell yeah/

HUNTER
Right, but like, where was it

though? Shit was gone!

The illusion was designed for a woman’s body! I have to tuck it back or else it gets all tangled in the clothes!

EVERYONE
(relieved)

Oooh/ Makes sense/ Okay.
 
52.


ANGLE ON - OWEN is being checked out by an EMT.

OWEN
(confused)

Why were you naked on stage?

CONNER
I don’t know, Owen!

HUNTER
Hey for real, Conner. Thank you for this. This is the funniest shit.

CONNER
You’re enjoying this aren’t you?

HUNTER
Yes.

CONNER
You know, my costume just ripped
off. Like someone cut it. You
wouldn’t know who did that would

you, Hunter?

HUNTER
Oh, I wish I did this. This is genius prank shit. Although, maybe I did do it? I’m playin’, I didn’t. Or did I?

CONNER
Did you?

HUNTER
I did! Hahaha! Shit was hilarious.

I’m the king of pranks.

CONNER
What? You really did it? Why?

HUNTER
(shrug)

Dunno. Who gives a fuck? Right?

CONNER
(exasperated)

Where’s Paula?

CUT TO:
 
53.


INT. ARENA - DRESSING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Just Conner, Harry and Paula pow-wow.

PAULA
Let’s stay calm, ok? Ten years ago, a guy naked on stage would have been a big deal, now it’s just a drop in the bucket of the dog-shit avalanche that is the internet.

HARRY
Church.

PAULA
All we need is a different story to wipe it out of the press cycle.

CONNER
Okay, great. What do we do?

PAULA
Well, let’s think, a new single, a crazy haircut, visit a sick kid in the hospital, babies, weddings, kittens...

CONNER
No, no, that all just sounds fake.

People aren’t stupid.

HARRY
Agree to disagree.

CONNER
Let’s just keep thinking. I gotta
get the fuck out of here and

twitter a picture of my dick.

He heads out.

PAULA
(calling after)

Don’t actually do that!

CUT TO:


INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

Conner, cozied on the couch, VIDEO CHATS with Ashley.
 
54.


ASHLEY (ON SCREEN)
Oh my god, that sucks so bad, I’m

sorry, dude.

CONNER
It’s a nightmare.

ASHLEY (ON SCREEN)
What an asshole. That guy is

seriously crazy.

CONNER
Yeah, he’s ok. Definitely pisses me off.

She cracks a smile.

ASHLEY (ON SCREEN)
It’s kinda funny though. Like, it

couldn’t be worse at least.

They both laugh.

CONNER
Wow, you have a very positive

attitude.

ASHLEY (ON SCREEN)
It’s in my nature. I’m a very

caring person...

Conner smiles, smitten.

CONNER (V.O.)
Ashley is the best. I can really just be myself with her. Which is why it’s so frustrating to be apart all the time.


EXT. HOTEL POOL AREA - NIGHT

Conner chats with Paula.

CONNER
I’m gonna propose to Ashley.

PAULA
Wow. Really?
 
55.


CONNER
Yeah, it’s like what Paul Newman once said about his wife “why go out for burgers, when you could be at home, fucking your girl.”

PAULA
Oh, that’s weird, I can actually hear him rolling in his grave from here. Wait, is this cause of the naked on stage thing? We can think of something else.

CONNER
What? No Paula, that’s so insulting. I’m just, so sick of us not being together.

PAULA
So is she coming on tour with you?

CONNER
No.

PAULA
Are you quitting the tour to be on set with her?

CONNER
Naw.

PAULA
So how is this gonna change

anything?

CONNER
Cuz... we’ll be married.

PAULA
(skeptical)

Huh.

CUT TO:


EXT. BEAUTIFUL HILLTOP - SUNSET

A STRETCH HUMMER CONVERTIBLE drives up a gorgeous hill.

Conner gives a nod, and we reveal a 12-PIECE ORCHESTRA on the hillside, they start to play.
 
56.


ASHLEY
Conner! What is this?

CONNER
Just a little bit further...

They walk along a path of candles. Into the center. Conner removes her blindfold. Flood lights fill the space.

TETHERED TO THE GROUND AROUND THEM THERE ARE: 20 WOLVES

ASHLEY
(touched)

Oh my god, Conner.

TALKING HEAD - CONNER & ASHLEY

ASHLEY (CONT’D)
My psychic told me I was a wolf in a previous life, which makes SO much sense, but I can’t believe Conner remembered.

CONNER
(bashful)

Molly doesn’t affect my memory.

ASHLEY
You’re amazing.

RESUME - HILLTOP

A bunch of NEWS MEDIA PEOPLE snap photos.

ASHLEY (CONT’D)
(touched)

And you invited the press. What is this Conner?

Conner nods to someone...

The singer SEAL steps in with the orchestra and sings a ballad version of “Mona Lisa”.

SEAL
I landed in Paris/ at a quarter to

noon...

ASHLEY
Is that Seal?! Oh my god, Conner!!!

THE WOLVES start to GROWL and HOWL.

A WOLF HANDLER leans into HARRY.
 
57.


WOLF HANDLER
(subtitled)

The music is upsetting the wolves.

E! FOOTAGE - Conner gets down on one knee. Ashley cries.

ON THE HILL - Conner tries to speak over the din.

CONNER
(inaudible)

Ashley, from the moment I saw you-- (yelling off)

Can someone get them to stop making that noise?

The trainer shrugs. Conner resumes.

CONNER (CONT’D)
Ok. Will you, Ashley Wednesday,

marry me?

ASHLEY
Yes! Yes!

They kiss and everyone applauds. Seal hits the chorus.

The insane wolves lunge forward on their leashes. The STAKES tethering them start to pull out of the ground.

The wolf handlers start running around. Harry leans in.

HARRY
Congratulations. Maybe we should be

getting out of here.

We hear a SCREAM. Camera catches a glimpse of a WOLF ATTACKING a handler.

Suddenly, ALL THE WOLVES ARE FREE.

HARRY (CONT’D)
Go! Go! Go!

Conner grabs Ashley and they run towards the hummer. Camera follows like an embedded war camera crew.

NEWS HELICOPTER FOOTAGE - Like World War Z, a swarm of wolves overrunning the site.

It’s a nightmare. People run for their lives. The MUSICIANS fight wolves with their instruments.

Conner, Ashley and Harry, reach the hummer, jump in.
 
58.


HARRY (CONT’D)
LET’S GO!!!

They start to drive off, just as SEAL runs up.

ASHLEY
SEAL!!

Slam on the breaks. Conner swings the door open.

SEAL
THANK YOU!

CONNER
ARE YOU OKAY!?

SEAL
I’M FINE! FOR A SECOND THERE I

THOUGHT--

A WOLF JUMPS ON SEAL, biting his arm.

SEAL (CONT’D)
AHHHHHHHH!!

ASHLEY/CONNER
AHHHHH!!!/OH FUCK!

Seal expertly spins the wolf and BREAKS IT’S NECK.

CONNER
Whoa.

SEAL
Don’t worry. I’ve been in this situation before. How do you think I got these scars?

CONNER
From wolves?

SEAL
(nods)

Fucking wolves. Now, let’s get out of here--

Just then, A WOLF JUMPS IN AND BITES HIS FACE, WIPING HIM OUT OF FRAME IN AN EYEBLINK.

Everyone stares a beat, not sure what to say.

ALL
FUUUCK!!! GO!! GO! GO!!!
 
59.


POV LOOKING BACK - AS THEY DRIVE OFF, WOLVES SWARM SEAL...

The sounds of a TV CROWD TAKE US TO...


EXT. 30 ROCKEFELLER PLAZA - DAY

NBC establishing...

JIMMY FALLON (O.S.)

Seal, and a pack of angry wolves.
All on national TV, that’s great

entertainment.


INT. THE TONIGHT SHOW WITH JIMMY FALLON - TV BROADCAST

Conner with JIMMY FALLON on the couch.

CONNER
Yeah, and I just wanna to thank
Seal again and wish him a fast

recovery. He’s going to be fine.

JIMMY FALLON
That’s great news. Well I’m so

happy for you and Ashley.

CONNER
Thanks. And don’t forget, CONNquest is in stores now. Cop that.

JIMMY FALLON
Yeah, it’s so good, but can I just fan-out for a second? My favorite thing of yours from back in the day: the Donkey Roll.

The crowd cheers.

CONNER
Awwwww, ha ha.

JIMMY FALLON
For the kids out there, the Donkey Roll is from Conner’s old group, the Drama Boyz. I don’t wanna brag, but I used to do a mean Donkey Roll back in college.

CONNER
Oh for real?
 
60.


JIMMY FALLON
Yeah man, some said it was even

better than yours.

CONNER
Don’t do that, Jimmy Fallon.

JIMMY FALLON
Now I know I saw Kid Contact
backstage, do you think we could

get him out here?

CONNER
I doubt he’d be into that.

Owen comes charging out. The audience goes crazy. Jimmy jumps up and they all move to the stage.

JIMMY FALLON
Okay, I’ll be filling in for Kid

Murder. Roots, Donkey Roll us!

The Roots play “DONKEY ROLL”. The guys do a silly dance routine. The crowd LOVES IT. They finish.

JIMMY FALLON (CONT’D) You can see conner4real tomorrow night here in NYC with Hunter The Hungry. Give it up for conner4real and Kid Contact!

OWEN
That’s what I’m talking about. I

wish Lawrence could’ve been here!

Conner rolls his eyes.

TALKING HEAD - CONNER
 
61.


CONNER
Ever since Drama Boyz broke up, Lawrence has been mad at me. He claims he wrote my famous “catch-phrase” verse. Translation: he’s a jealous-ass hater who’s mad that I blew up and he’s a farmer out in bumfuck nowhere.

CUT TO:


EXT. BIG TIMBER, COLORADO - DAY

A bird gives a lonesome call.


INT. CABIN - DAY

Lawrence at a work bench, shows off various WOOD-CARVINGS.

This one here is a lost pixie

child. With a flute.

CLOSE - The wood carving is ugly as hell.

He holds up another, it’s a big mess.

LAWRENCE (CONT’D)
I call this one “government in

crisis”.

He picks up another.

LAWRENCE (CONT’D) This is my Grammy for writing Conner’s famous “catch phrase” verse. If you look closely, you’ll notice that it’s not real. Because I didn’t get a Grammy. Or any credit of any kind.

CLOSE - it’s a grotesque wooden Grammy.

JUMP TO - Lawrence arranging the carvings on a shelf.

DIRECTOR’S VOICE (O.S.)
Are you still mad at Conner?

I’m a one woman man now, guys.

Gotta respect that. No more ladies.

SPONGE
You’re lucky I’m bisexual. Or else

I’d be pissed.

EDDIE
You’re bisexual? That’s dope. You can fuck anyone. The possibilities are infinite. Congrats, bruh.

SPONGE
Thanks.

TALKING HEAD - CONNER

CONNER
I know my engagement was so rock n roll and spontaneous, but I gotta say, I’m starting to really get into the tradition of it all. Like, the pageantry and shit.

INT. ARENA - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

Conner looks at WEDDING INVITES with Zippy.

CONNER
What do you think of this font?

ZIPPY
See, I like that, it’s elegant but also street. Not unlike yourself.

CONNER
Well put.

ZIPPY
Plus that part on the bottom looks like a chooch.

Conner stares at him. TILLY enters.

TILLY
Where’s my boy?

CONNER
Ma! You made it!

They hug.

TILLY
My little baby’s getting married!

JUMP TO - Tilly and Conner excitedly talk.

CONNER
So, did you bring grandma’s ring?

TILLY
Oh, shoot, I completely spaced it.

I’m so sorry, Conny.

CONNER
Aw, that’s ok. Next time. I think

Ash is gonna love it.

TILLY
I know she will. Now, what does a
gal have to do to get a drink

around here, buster?

CONNER
My bad. Yo, get my mom a drink!

- Tilly does shots of tequila with the entourage.
 
64.


-	Flirts with BODYGUARDS.

-	Discretely does a line of cocaine with Sarah.

TILLY (V.O.)
Being on the road has always been a dream of mine. When I was younger I actually won a few singing competitions and was becoming famous myself, but then Conner was born and I had to give all that up. But now I’m here!

-	Tilly waves over Tyrus, eats off his tray. He smiles.

-	She smokes with the crew, Conner walks up with MILEY CYRUS.

CONNER
Ma, I want you to meet, Miley.

TILLY
How do you do?

CONNER
Miley is starting an animal rights organization, tell her.

MILEY CYRUS
Yeah, like, I don’t think animals should have the right to drive cars, fly planes, use the stove or anything dangerous.

CONNER
I agree. It’s like, why would a goat need to use the stove? Anyways, I gotta get ready, but see you after the show?

MILEY CYRUS
Alright.
(turns to Tilly)

Hey, Tilly, you gonna park that shit all night or let my hippie ass take a hit?

Tilly passes her a huge JOINT, exhales a massive hit.

OWEN (CONT’D)
I really think Conner wants shit to be cool with you guys, you know? He knows he messed up.

A STAGE MANAGER pops in the door.

STAGE MANAGER
One minute warning!

OWEN
Shit, ok, I guess just peep the show and then we’ll all hang at the after party, like old times, cool?

near here so I told him to come.

CONNER
I don’t wanna see his ass. Tell him to go home.

OWEN
No, it’s not like that anymore. He’s cool. I think he really wants to be friends again, you know?

CONNER
Owen, you’re not hearing me. Lawrence doesn’t get it. Shit changed. I adjusted. You adjusted. We’re killing it. He’ll never evolve. Text me when he’s gone.

CUT TO:


INT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

In the VIP, Lawrence is sandwiched between a bunch of HOT/HIP PEOPLE and DRAKE who is animatedly speaking his mind.

DRAKE
I bought 3 jets. How the fuck am I gonna be on 3 jets at once? I had a plan to put a bad bitch on each one and zip line between those muthafuckas in midair. But they said it was an insurance risk though. So I just fucked all 3 of them on one. But it didn’t make me happy though.

LAWRENCE
Totally.

JUMP TO -

In the VIP - Lawrence bored, checks his phone. Owen walks up.

Sup?

OWEN
So, hey, bit of bad news. You know how it goes after a show, Conner’s exhausted, I don’t know if he’s gonna make it tonight.

LAWRENCE
Yeah right. Thanks for the invite,

Owen.

Lawrence turns to leave.

OWEN
Don’t go, man. He’s lost right now, I’m telling you. His album isn’t selling and he’s getting married to this girl he barely knows.

LAWRENCE
Ashley Wednesday, the gorgeous

movie star.

OWEN
I know, right? And he’s barely
going to clear 3 million dollars

from this tour.

LAWRENCE
Sounds awful.

OWEN
I know you’re joking, but seriously, engagement on his social media channels has slowed to a crawl.
(dramatic)
He needs us. We’re his only real
friends. He’s drowning man.

LAWRENCE
Then let him drown.

Come on, Lawrence. He’s under the water, and he doesn’t even know it.

drowning.

MILEY CYRUS
Do want me to stop this dude? I’ll fuck him up.

Lawrence starts jumping up and down on the hood. Conner and Miley are bouncing up and down.

Nahh, tell me more about Gwenevere.

Ha ha! Run fuckboy! Wooo!

Conner gets out of the car and looks at the damaged hood.

CONNER
Jesus.

MILEY CYRUS
Goddamn, I’m fucking wet as shit

right now.

A FANCY CAR pulls up, and Conner watches as Hunter and a bunch of HOT GIRLS get out, and Miley goes over to greet them.

HARRY (V.O.)
This business is hard, the highs

It’s so easy to get lost.

The crowd cheers. Hunter looks at his dudes, “what the fuck?”

HUNTER
Haha! What are you doing here

Conner?

CONNER
I could ask you same thing, Hunter!

Yo, Contact drop that beat!

OWEN, who’s DJ booth has risen on stage directly parallel with Hunter’s DJ, cues up the beat. Owen looks at Hunter’s DJ and mouths “I’m sorry”, then puts on his HELMET.

He drops the beat. Lights flash. The crowd goes nuts.

HUNTER
Eh, Tiny Tony, drop my beat too!

Hunter’s DJ, looks at Owen and shrugs. He drops ANOTHER BEAT:

THE TWO SONGS NOW PLAY SIMULTANEOUSLY.

It’s like a wall of noise. Fans in the crowd grimace.

Harry sits on a couch with Owen who ices his head. Conner paces upset, holding Maximus.

CONNER
We have to get rid of Hunter, Harry. He just doesn’t fit the vibe anymore.

HARRY
We can’t fire him, Conner. He’s the reason we sold out the tour. Aquaspin was even suggesting that he co-headline--

CONNER
What? That’s crazy!

HARRY
He’s number one on BongoHub and
SongRaper right now. He’s hot as

boiled milk.

CONNER
What number are we?

HARRY
It’s not a competition.

OWEN
Can we talk about this helmet? It’s crazy heavy and hurting my back--
 
74.


CONNER
Owen, why are you talking right
now? What are you even doing in

this meeting?

OWEN
I’m in all our meetings.

CONNER
Dude, get out. You’re the DJ.

OWEN
What?

CONNER
Get out. Go have a meeting with

Lawrence or something.

Owen looks pissed. Walks out.
