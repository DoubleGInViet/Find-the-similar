CONNER (CONT’D)
Harry, I need you to handle this,

you represent me, not him.

HARRY
Actually, technically I represent

both of you.

Conner is stunned.

CONNER
You signed Hunter?

HARRY
Conner--

CONNER
Oh, fuck you, Harry.

Conner exits.

HARRY
Conner!


EXT. HORSE MEADOWS - DAY

BEAUTIFUL FOOTAGE of Conner watching HORSES prances around.

CONNER (V.O.)
I’ve spent my whole life building
an empire and now I can feel it

crumbling beneath my feet.
 
75.


INT. ARENA - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

Conner sits on a chair like Michael Corleone, watching:

ACROSS THE ROOM - Hunter is holding court, being “hilarious”, Eddie, Sponge, Zippy, Sarah, and even Owen are laughing their asses off. (SLO-MO??)

CONNER (V.O.)
People are trying to take away what I built. And only time will tell who’s being real, and who’s just hungry for the spotlight? I need to know who I can trust.


INT. CONNER’S WOODLAND HILLS ESTATE - MORNING

Sponge, Eddie, Sarah, Owen and Harry hang out. Conner is in the kitchen cooking pancakes.

CONNER
Aallllrrriiight ya’ll, come and get

em! Conner’s fancy flap jacks!

They sidle up to the counter.

EDDIE
Hell yeah.

OWEN
What’s the occasion?

CONNER
Can’t a friend just glop some pancakes? Tyrus isn’t the only one who can cook. Come on, eat up.

Conner watches intently as they all sample the pancakes.
They are not good, but they try to fake it.

SPONGE
Can you pass the syrup?

CONNER
Sponge, liking the pancakes?

SPONGE
Yup. So good, dude.

CONNER
Have another bite.
 
76.


SPONGE
Planning on it. Right now.

He muscles through a bite.

CONNER
Eddie?

Eddie is startled.

EDDIE
(mouth full)

Huh?

CONNER
Good?

EDDIE
Really good.

CONNER
Thanks man. Love you guys.

Owen is having trouble.

OWEN
What’s in these?

CONNER
All good stuff. Harry?

HARRY
They’re... interesting.

CONNER
Good interesting?

HARRY
I think so?

Owen spits his out into a napkin.

OWEN
I’m sorry, I can’t do it. Conner, I love you, but these are not good.

Conner looks Owen deep in his eyes.

CONNER
Thank you, Owen. Truly.

OWEN
Okay?
 
77.


CONNER
And the rest of you liked them?

Sponge and Eddie give fake yes. Harry nods tentatively.

CONNER (CONT’D)
Well, that is really disappointing.

Cause they were not good.

SPONGE
I knew it.

CONNER
And the reason they were not good

was that I put dog shit in them.

OWEN
WHAT?!?!?!

SPONGE/EDDIE
Dang dude!/ That’s nasty!!!/ So

hilarious!

HARRY
Oh gawd!

Harry runs to the bathroom.

CONNER
I did it to see who would tell me

the truth.

SPONGE/EDDIE
Yo that’s mad smart/ The test of a master/

CONNER
No. Stop it you guys. Stop just

agreeing with me.

SPONGE/EDDIE
No doubt/It’s not useful/ Gotta be honest.

CONNER
Stop.

SPONGE/EDDIE
Stopping is best/ Silence is

golden.

OWEN
You just made me eat dog shit?!

What the fuck is wrong with you!?
 
78.


CONNER
Owen, relax, you’re the only one

here who passed the test.

EDDIE
Dang, nice Owen, congrats.

OWEN
Ok. I’m out. For real. I fucking

quit.

Owen starts to leave.

CONNER
What? You can’t quit.

OWEN
What do I even do anymore, Conner?! I push play on an iPod in a robot costume! You might as well have the robot from Rocky IV be your DJ!

CONNER
Fine! I would love that! It sounds cool!

OWEN
Great! I’ll send you my uncle’s
phone number, he was props master

on Rocky IV!

Owen storms out, pissed.

CONNER
Owen, come on!

SPONGE
(faking it)
Yeah, I’m mad too! I hated eating

shit! I’m a real guy, like Owen!

Sponge walks in place, pretending to leave.

CONNER
You’re still here.

SPONGE
But should I leave though?

Conner shakes his head in disbelief.
 
79.


OFF TO THE SIDE - Sarah absentmindedly eats the pancakes while texting. No reaction whatsoever.

CUT TO:


INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Conner tries to Facetime Ashley. She does not pick up. He hangs up. Sighs.


INT. PRIVATE JET - DAY

Conner stares out the window. DRAMATIC MUSIC TAKES US TO:


INT. SPACE STATION SCIENCE LAB - MOVIE SCENE - NIGHT

We are in a futuristic hallway, ALARMS sound, 20 TROOPERS run by in formation. CAMERA SWOOPS into a LABORATORY where we find Ashley, looking kinda like Katniss Everdeen, frantically testing chemicals.

CHRIS HEMSWORTH enters looking like John Conner, blocks the door with a desk.

ASHLEY
You’re not supposed to be in here.

CHRIS HEMSWORTH
My cube is still three clicks from

A-Zero. They can’t see me.

Chris moves towards Ashley.

ASHLEY
Don’t. You know my cube doesn’t
allow me to feel emotions. I’ll

just disappoint you.

CHRIS HEMSWORTH
My cube makes me immortal. I can

wait forever.

He takes her hand, their faces get close.

REVEAL - WE ARE ON A SOUNDSTAGE. Conner watches from video village.

L/3: “CUBE THEOREM SET VISIT - SHREVEPORT, LOUSIANA”

BACK IN THE SCENE -
 
80.


ASHLEY
But my cube is beta-six, no

physical contact.

CHRIS HEMSWORTH
(romantic)

Cubes are made to be broken.

They kiss passionately. Conner is uncomfortable.

FIRST A.D.
And cut! That’s our day, people.

ASHLEY
Connyyyyyy!!!!

She runs over and jumps on Conner, they kiss.

CONNER
Hey, it’s so good to see you. The
tour’s been so weird, Owen just

quit if you can believe that--

ASHLEY
(noticing someone)

Heeeyyy! Conny, hold that thought, you have to meet Chris.

Conner and Chris Hemsworth shake hands. (Everyone is super nice, like “in a cult” nice.)

CHRIS HEMSWORTH
Conner, so awesome to meet you. I’m
a huge fan. Thanks for letting us

borrow Ashley. She’s the best.

CONNER
Ha. Happy to help.

They turn to video village.

ASHLEY
And this is Scarlett and Channing.

SCARLETT JOHANSSON and CHANNING TATUM greet Conner.

SCARLETT JOHANSSON
Nice to meet you.

CHANNING TATUM
Duuuude, what’s up man?! Great to

finally meet you.
 
81.


SCARLETT JOHANSSON
Are you coming to the party

tonight?

CHANNING TATUM
Oh yeah, you gotta come!

ASHLEY
Can we go, honey?

CONNER
Uhhh
(off her look)

Sure, what is it?

CHANNING TATUM
Oh, it’s the best, there’s nothing to do out here, so every night after wrap we go to my penthouse suite and order tons of room service--

SCARLETT JOHANSSON
--and drinks, and margaritas, and
(corner of her mouth,
playful)
a little weed and we just pig out

and relax--

CHRIS HEMSWORTH
--and fuck each other.

Beat.

CONNER
What?

ASHLEY
Connie, it’s so boring here. I told you that.

CONNER
Yeah, you told me. But what happens at the party?

SCARLETT JOHANSSON
We all fuck. Each other. Every

night.

CONNER
The four of you?
 
82.


CHRIS HEMSWORTH
(don’t be silly!)
No, not the four of us!
Everyone in the cast. Ryan,

Rosemary--

CHANNING TATUM
...Even the old ones, Tilda,

Javiar... It’s soo boring here.

EVERYONE
So boring/ yeah boring/ gotta fuck/ what else are you gonna do?

Conner is not psyched.

CUT TO:


INT. DRESSING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Ashley gets out of wardrobe. Conner is heartbroken.

CONNER
I just don’t understand how this
has been happening every night.

We’re engaged!

ASHLEY
Don’t be so uptight, Conner. I
thought you were sleeping with

other people too.

CONNER
What? Why would you think that? I told you constantly that I wasn’t.

ASHLEY
I thought you were joking. Are you taking our engagement seriously or something? I thought you just needed some good press?

CONNER
What? Who told you that?

ASHLEY
My eyes and brain? It was right after your no-dick-on-stage thing.

CONNER
Just because that timed out
perfectly doesn’t mean I didn’t

really want to marry you.
 
83.


ASHLEY
Okay, sorry.

CONNER
Jesus, do you care about me at all?

ASHLEY
Sure, Conner. But people like us, we belong to the world. It would be selfish of me to keep you all to myself, and it’s selfish of you to expect that of me.

CONNER
I strongly disagree--

Suddenly, RUSSELL CROWE leans in to her room.

RUSSELL CROWE
Hey, you ready to go?-- Oh sorry,

am I interrupting?

CONNER
(star-struck)

Hi.

ASHLEY
No, we were just finishing up.

CONNER
I’m Conner. Ashley’s fiancee.

RUSSELL CROWE
Russell, nice to meet you. I’m a

big fan.

CONNER
Oh my god. I’m your biggest fan. I even named my pet turtle, Maximus, from your movie, you know--

CONNER & RUSSELL CROWE
Gladiator.

CONNER
Yeah. Oh my god, best movie.

RUSSELL CROWE
(as Maximus)
My name is Maximus Decimus
Meridius, commander of the Armies

of the North...
 
84.


Conner joins in, they stare into each other’s eyes. Chanting the dialogue more and more intensely.

CONNER & RUSSELL CROWE General of the Felix Legions and loyal servant to the TRUE emperor, Marcus Aurelius. Father to a murdered son, husband to a murdered wife. And I will have my vengeance, in this life or the next!!!

They laugh and then snap into the Gladiator neck-clutch hug.

RUSSELL CROWE
Tell me you are coming to the orgy!

CONNER
Wouldn’t miss it.

Russell leaves. Conner turns to Ashley.

CONNER (CONT’D)
I’m still very hurt by this.

CUT TO:


INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - NIGHT

Camera follows Conner and Ashley down the hall to a door with a SECURITY GUARD.

CONNER
So, how does this work, do we like start with each other and then slowly branch out, or...

ASHLEY
Will you relax? It’s not a big deal. Just find a hole and fuck it.

CONNER
Oookay.

Ashley turns to Conner.

ASHLEY
It goes without saying I think we

should break up after this.

CONNER
It does?
 
85.


ASHLEY
Yeah, you’re kinda bumming me out, and I don’t have time for that right now.
(then)

See you in there, champ.

Conner is heartbroken.

SECURITY GUARD
(to the director)

Sorry, no cameras.

Conner leaves us to go into the room, through the doorway we HEAR crazy orgy sounds and catch a GLIMPSE of JAMES FRANCO fucking SETH ROGEN.

SETH
Conner4real no way!

The door shuts.


EXT. HOTEL - NIGHT

Our CAMERA ANGLES ON a group of PAPARAZZI across the street, shooting up a the building.

One of them sends out a DRONE, which heads up, up, up...

DRONE CAM - It finds the balcony, with CONNER, bent over a BBQ GRILL, apparently getting fucked by (a very bored-looking) JESSICA CHASTAIN from behind.

CMZ GRAPHIC APPEARS ON FOOTAGE: “CUBE THEOREM SEX PARTIES?!”


INT. CMZ STUDIO - TV BROADCAST

We are in a fake TMZ studio (all “corespondents” played by comedians).

MAIN ASSHOLE
So apparently on the set of Cube
Theorem, the entire cast has wild

sex orgies.

He slurps from a GIANT SODA.

BRUNETTE ASSHOLE
This is my favorite part,
conner4real reaches back to high
five Jessica Chastain and she

leaves him hanging.
 
86.


DREADLOCK’D ASSHOLE
My question is, what is happening?
Is she wearing a strap-on? What am

I looking at?

BLONDE ASSHOLE
So, to recap, conner4real gets dumped by his superstar girlfriend and then gets high-five dissed by Jessica Chastain. Not his best day.

They all laugh and slurp from EVEN BIGGER SODAS.

MAIN ASSHOLE
Let’s watch it again!

The IMAGE FREEZES and WE ARE IN:


INT. AQUASPIN CORPORATE OFFICES - SAME TIME

Wally freezes the footage on a horribly embarrassing frame.

Conner sits in a boardroom with Harry, Wally and SUSAN, a mousey woman (think Rachel Dratch).

WALLY
You care to explain, player?

CONNER
Um... I’m sorry?

WALLY
Do you know how many people I had to convince that your dumbass behavior was somehow beneficial to Aquaspin?

CONNER
How many?

WALLY
All of these motherfuckers! Plus Susan, who was extremely hard to convince. Isn’t that right, Susan?

Pan over to SUSAN. She nods, blankly.

WALLY (CONT’D)
See?! Susan wanted to fire your ass immediately, but I said no. I said that you were cooler for going to a tinseltown sex party.

(MORE)
 
87.

WALLY (CONT’D)
I even thought I might go with you to the next one. Susan, didn’t I say that shit in the board meeting?

Susan nods.

CONNER
Okay, so what’s the problem?

WALLY
The problem, is this!

Wally points to the FROZEN IMAGE of Conner on screen and points to the BBQ GRILL he leans against.

WALLY (CONT’D)
What brand of BBQ grill would you

say you’re having sex on top of?

CONNER
Uh, I don’t know--

WALLY
It’s a Tepper, dog! And Tepper is
Aquaspin’s main competitor in

outdoor grills and accessories!

CONNER
Okay?

WALLY
You can’t be seen in public with the competition! So, you’re fired.

CONNER
Wait, what?

WALLY
I’m sorry, but Aquaspin is no longer in the conner4real business.

HARRY
Take it easy, Wally.

CONNER
Harry, you knew about this?

HARRY
I tried to stop it. But I couldn’t let everyone lose their jobs--

CONNER
What are you talking about? You

just got the tour canceled.
 
88.


WALLY
Oh, the tour’s still happening.

Just with Hunter.

Conner looks stunned.

CONNER
You can’t do that!

WALLY
It’s out of my hands. Right, Susan?

Susan shrugs apathetically.

CONNER
What do you even do as my manager, Harry? Seriously? Because I couldn’t fuck myself over worse if I was managing myself.

HARRY
Conner, try to relax. I already got you a new high-paying gig.

CONNER
Oh really, what?

HARRY
It’s... ok, it’s a quincinera but a fancy one--

CONNER
Oh my God! You know what? I love this, cuz now it’s my turn: You’re fired.

Harry is crushed.

WALLY
Great. This was fun.

CUT TO:

89.


EXT. CONNER’S WOODLAND HILLS ESTATE - BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

Conner shreds up the lawn in an ATV, doing doughnuts.

HARRY (V.O.)
Because of that, he never really
learned to handle adversity in an
adult way. But you know, he’ll be

fine. We’ll both be...

Conner jumps off and lets the ATV SMASH INTO A FOUNTAIN.


INT. CONNER’S WOODLAND HILLS ESTATE - LATER

Conner SAMURAI SWORDS a PROMO STANDEE for his album.

CONNER
Maximus? Where are you buddy?

CONNER (CONT’D)

Maximus’ neck is super extended out of his shell.

MAXIMUS

Why is he making that noise??

SPLAT! He reacts to something super gross.

CONNER (CONT’D)
Ew, fuck! We have to take him to

the hospital!

HALLWAY - EMBEDDED JOURNALIST STYLE: WE FOLLOW Conner as he rushes down the hall with Maximus in a SMALL CASE.

CONNER (CONT’D)
Hold on Maximus! Owen?! Harry?! Is anyone here?!

OUTSIDE - Conner runs outside to the HOT TUB, where Sponge and Eddie are bathing with 2 HOTTIES.

CONNER (CONT’D)

They get to the front gate but there is a MOB OF PAPARAZZI.

PAPARAZZI
Conner!/Conner!/ How was the orgy?

CONNER
Get out of the way!

Conner is frazzled, getting more upset. He puts the car into reverse, and skids backwards.


EXT. BACK GATE - MOMENTS LATER

They reach the back gate but it’s also blocked by PAPS.
 
91.


PAPARAZZI
Conner!/ How’s Jessica Chastain?!

WE HEAR ANOTHER MOAN AND SPLAT!

CONNER
Hang on, buddy!

Conner lays on the horn, sticks his head out the window.

PAPARAZZI FOOTAGE OF THIS FROM THE OUTSIDE:

CONNER (CONT’D)
(crying)

Please! Everyone move! My turtle is sick! He’s dying! Ahhhaaaa!

The SUV cannot move. It’s chaos. Conner is stuck.

CONNER (CONT’D)

The song continues under the following SAD SEQUENCE:

Conner grabs at the camera and misses, falls into a puddle.

EXT. CONNER’S WOODLAND HILLS ESTATE - SWIMMING POOL - DAY

Conner, Sponge, Eddie and others are gathered for a ceremony.
 
93.


CONNER (V.O.)
Death smiles upon all of us. All a man can do is smile back.

Conner holds small boat piled high with wood and a small coffin. He pushes it out into the pool.

CONNER
His name was Maximus Decimus
Meridius. He was a Caspian Pond

Turtle. And he was my best friend.

Conner is handed a ROMAN CANDLE, he shoots it at the floating coffin and it BURSTS into flames. Conner and crew go bananas.

JUMP TO - Sponge and Eddie sneak out with luggage, Conner stops them.

SPONGE

Conner, what’s up, fam? We were just taking our bags... to the bag washing store...

CONNER
What?

EDDIE
Okay, Sponge was just saying we should go with Hunter, cause he’s on tour with the pussy and whatnot. And I was like nah let’s stick with Conner and just be sad and depressed and sit around the house and shit.

Conner nods, resigned.

SPONGE
If you get popular again though,

we’ll totally fuck with you.


INT. STAGE - RESUME

mom is such a looney toon!

TILLY
Haha! Ouch! Don’t you slap my butt!

Heeeey.

He hugs her... and doesn’t let go.

PAULA
Whup, ok.. oh man, you smell like
booze... and other smells.
(nervous look to camera)

Conner. Come on. Let’s go inside.

Conner pulls away, he has tears in his eyes.

CONNER
(choked up)

Ha, I’m just messing with you. I’m not even sad.

PAULA
Let’s get you some tea and a

blanket.

CONER
Yeah, right. That sounds like me.


INT. CONNER’S CHILDHOOD HOME - LIVING ROOM - LATER

Conner, sits wrapped in a blanket like a little kid, he sips a big mug of TEA.
 
96.


PAULA
That better?

CONNER
M-hm.

PAULA
Can I ask you something? Why are
the cameras still here? They’re
shooting a concert film with no

concerts.

WE PAN TO SEE - The Camera Crew

CONNER
I mean, it’s my movie, I’m at my
lowest moment. But that’s always

when shit gets better, right?

PAULA
What do you think is going to

happen?

CONNER
I dunno, Ashley’s gonna get back with me? Bongohub is gonna call and say they screwed up and I sold a ton of records. Then I’ll wake up in the middle of the night and write the most beautiful song and it’ll be a big hit...

Conner tears up...

PAULA
(to the crew)

Is he okay? What has he been doing?

CAMERA GUY (O.C.)
He masturbated two times.

CONNER
I forgot to tell them to leave.

She grabs Conner by the face.

PAULA
You gotta get it together, buddy.
This is not a movie, it’s your

life. Only you can fix it.
 
97.


CONNER
Is this where you tell me you were secretly in love with me all along? Is that why you came back?

PAULA
No, I just thought you were going to kill yourself and I didn’t want to deal with the press.

CONNER
Smart.

WE HEAR A “KNOCK” ON THE DOOR...


I/E. CONNER’S CHILDHOOD HOME - DAY - LATER

Paula opens the front door to see UNCLE RONALD.

UNCLE RONALD
Hello, young people!

PAULA
Hey Ronald, thanks for coming.

UNCLE RONALD
I woulda been here sooner if he’d told me he was even in town! Where is that boy?

Conner enters, they hug.

UNCLE RONALD (CONT’D)
Come here, ya little hellion.

TALKING HEAD - RONALD & CONNER

Conner and RONALD sit on the couch. As they talk WE SEE FOOTAGE of them going through their old CD collection.

RONALD
Conner was 8 when I started dating his mother. And that’s when I began schooling him on REAL music.

CONNER
Whaaat?

RONALD
That’s right. Something his
generation don’t know nothing
about. Deep cuts, esoteric blues
and R&B. “

CONNER
Ohh, 6 is classic. Creed, Incubus,

Shaggy, that was a big year.

RONALD

My little protégé.

A DIFFERENT CAMERA finds Paula watching off to the side shaking her head and smiling.


INT. CONNER’S CHILDHOOD HOME - KITCHEN - LATER

Ronald makes sandwiches, Paula stands with a glass of wine.

RONALD
I dated Tilly during Conner’s formative years, when we broke up, didn't seem right to ditch the kid. Honestly, I think I was more attached than he was. That’s when the whole “uncle” Ronald thing started.
(calling out)

I’m putting pickles on yours!

CONNER (O.S.)
Nooooo!!!

RONALD
Heh, he hates pickles.

PAULA
I sadly also know that.
 
99.


INT. CONNER’S CHILDHOOD HOME - BACK PORCH - AFTERNOON

Conner, Paula and Ronald sip beers and play bones.

PAULA
Okaaaaaay... DOMINO, MOTHAFUCKA!

She slams down her last piece.

CONNER/RONALD
Awww!/ She’s a shark!/ So loud.

PAULA
Suck it, nerds. I’m grabbing a

drink, who wants one?

RONALD
Yes, please. None for Conner. He’s cut off for being a lightweight!

CONNER
That is so funny, Ronald. Great
joke.
(to Paula)

I’ll have one please.

She nods and walks off.

RONALD
That’s a good woman right there.

CONNER
Yeah, Paula’s a great publicist.

RONALD
That’s not what I meant, dumbo.

Conner sips his beer, we don’t know if that registered.

CONNER
What happened, Ronald? I feel lost.

RONALD
So you hit a rough patch. It

happens to everyone.

CONNER
Not to me.

RONALD
Yeah, even you. You act all Mr.
Cool, but when you were a kid,

you’d get down sometimes.
 
100.


CONNER
Yeah? And what would my mom do to
make me feel better? Do you

remember?

RONALD
Your mom? Ha! Don’t get me wrong, your mother is one of the sweetest ladies on this planet, and she did put food on the table...

OLD HOME VIDEOS - THE LITTLE LEAGUE GAME we saw before, as the Drama Boyz celebrate, CAMERA PANS UP to YOUNG TILLY, who drinks beer and flirts with a CONSTRUCTION WORKER.

RONALD (V.O.)
But Tilly’s always been more interested in Tilly then anyone else. She was not who you looked to for help. You always turned to your friends for that.

OLD HOME VIDEOS - Conner, Owen and Lawrence as kids at a slumber party. Running around, telling ghost stories...

RONALD (V.O.)
I remember hearing you guys
whispering, telling your little
girly secrets all through the
night. But you took care of each
other. More like brothers than
friends...

BACK TO THE PORCH - Conner nods, lost in thought.

WE SEE - FOOTAGE OF ANOTHER OLD DRAMA BOYZ VIDEO...


INT. CONNER’S CHILDHOOD HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

WE MATCH CUT and see the video is playing on the TV, Conner watches on the couch, pours some vodka in his tea.

PAULA
Okay, that’s it, get off your ass, we’re going out.

CONNER
Uch, no! I can’t deal with the

public right now.

PAULA
I’m not asking, Conner. Get the

fuck up.
 
101.


CONNER
Fine, I’ll go. On one condition.


INT. SACRAMENTO CAFE/CLUB - NIGHT

A small, bohemian place is packed with hipsters. Leaning against the bar are Paula and Conner who wears a SUPER SHITTY PROSTHETICS DISGUISE.

PAULA
You look insane.

CONNER
I don’t think it’s working, people keep staring at me.

PAULA
That’s because you look like the

fucking Elephant Man, Conner.

CONNER
I do not. They must recognize the
sparkle in my eyes. The human

subconscious is a wondrous thing.

ON STAGE - a FOLKSY PERFORMER finishes his set.

CONNER (CONT’D)
Man, The Omni, I haven’t been here in years.

THE BARTENDER hands them two beers and they toast.

MUSIC: A SUPER RAD BEAT kicks. Conner perks up.

CONNER (CONT’D)
Ooh, that shit is tight.

Paula smiles. Conner turns to find the person performing on stage is OWEN. His music sounds gritty and interesting.

CONNER (CONT’D)
Owen?

PAULA
He’s been making stuff all year.

And you never noticed.

CONNER
Alright, ghost of Christmas past.

ON STAGE - Owen is rocking it.
 
102.


CONNER (CONT’D)
Shit. He sounds great--

Just then Owen starts to sing the chorus. It’s weird little VOCODER OUTBURSTS over the otherwise incredible instrumental.

OWEN
Yeah! Hey! Yeah! Woo! Woo!

CONNER
Huh.

JUMP CUT TO LATER -

Owen signs autographs, Conner walks up in shitty disguise.

CONNER (CONT’D)
(pretend voice)
Great show, Kid Contact. That was

incredible.

Owen looks up from his autographs.

OWEN
Conner?

CONNER
Surprise!

OWEN
(laughing)
What? What the fuck is on your

face?

CONNER
Oh this? Had to rock the disguise, finally come check out my homie do his thang. You were great, man! Those beats are crazy.

OWEN
Thanks, man.

CONNER
Seriously, I’m impressed. My brain is like, already spinning on how you could get it out there big. If you got heat on the right blogs and the right satellite channels it could be huge. I could help.
 
103.


OWEN
That’s super generous, man, but, I think I might need to do this on my own, y’know?

This hits Conner.

CONNER
Oh. Ok. I get that.

OWEN
It really is nice of you to come

though. It means a lot.

CONNER
Yeah, no problem. And, sorry, about the pancakes... with shit in ‘em.
(emotional)
I took our friendship for granted. I wasn’t being conner4real, I was being conner4fake...

He starts tearing up again.

OWEN
Come on, you’re not conner4fake.

CONNER
(crying)

I am. I’m fucking conner4fake. And I’m sorry...

Conner looks awful, a piece of his disguise hangs off his face and dangles around. Owen can’t take it, busts out laughing.

OWEN
Fuck, it’s fine, man, I forgive

you. You look so fucking dumb!!

Conner is self-conscious. Owen grabs him, gives him a hug.
It’s nice.

CUT TO:


EXT. SACRAMENTO PRIVATE AIRPORT - DAY

ON THE TARMAC - Owen boards the JET. Conner turns to Paula.

CONNER
So, thanks for all this. Snapping

me out of it and whatnot.
 
104.


PAULA
You’re very welcome. Good luck,

buddy.

They hug. It lingers a beat. Conner looks at Paula for a moment, then kisses her.

PAULA (CONT’D)
Whoa, uh... no.

She pulls away.

CONNER
Sorry. But, you’ve never thought

about it?

PAULA
Conner, I’m gay.

CONNER
What?

PAULA
Yeah. I can’t believe you don’t
know that. We’ve known each other

for like 10 years, dude.

CONNER
Oh, wow. I’m sorry.

Paula giggles.

CONNER (CONT’D)
What?

PAULA
You wanted to have sex with me.

CONNER
No...

PAULA
That is so nasty. You wanted to like, get on top of my body and be all “Huuuuhhgggghhhhgghgggguuuuhh!”

CONNER
I’m gonna go.

Conner boards the plane.
 
105.


PAULA
Okay, don’t miss your flight, perv!

CUT TO:


INT. PRIVATE JET - LATER

Conner looks out the window. He smiles to himself.


EXT. LAWRENCE’S FARM - DAY

The peaceful mountains...


INT. CABIN - CONTINUOUS

Lawrence is doing a wood carving. He goes to put it on the shelf, notices something.

LAWRENCE
...the fuuuck?

He picks up a REAL GRAMMY AWARD.

LAWRENCE (CONT’D)
(to CAMERA CREW)

Did you guys put this here?

CUT TO:


EXT. LAWRENCE’S FARM - MOMENTS LATER

Lawrence steps out on his porch, still holding the Grammy.
Stops when he sees:

CONNER AND OWEN, standing in the yard.

CONNER
Hey, Lawrence.

LAWRENCE
Conner. Owen.

OWEN
Lawrence.
(then)

Conner.

Owen smiles at Conner, who gives him a weird look.
 
106.


CONNER
(re: Grammy)

That’s for you. To borrow. I figured we could take some pictures of you with it and you could post em or whatever.

LAWRENCE
Uh huh.

A beat. Owen nudges Conner.

CONNER
So, Lawrence, I came here to say:

I’m sorry.

Lawrence stares.

CONNER (CONT’D)
And, that’s it. So, we’re cool now.

Lawrence throws the Grammy as far as he can. They watch it disappear from sight.

CONNER (CONT’D)
Lawrence! Come on, man! I’m gonna
have to go find that now! You’re
such a turd!
(Lawrence stares)
Oh my God, what do you want me to
say? That you helped me on the
catch phrase verse? Fine. You
helped.
(Lawrence stares)
Fine you wrote a lot of it. Based
on my catch phrases.
(Lawrence stares)
Which you also co-wrote.
(Lawrence stares)
Fine, wrote. While we were both in the room and I was dictating all the best parts.
(Lawrence stares)
Some of the best parts.
(Lawrence stares)
None of the best parts. But tons of great stuff that I still don’t know why you didn’t use it.
(Lawrence stares)
Because they sucked, okay? But I
helped. I bought you food.
(MORE)
 
107.

CONNER (CONT’D)
I ordered pizzas and kept you hydrated-- Okay, you got the food, but I paid for it, and I didn’t have a lot of money back then. You gotta give me that.
(Lawrence stares)
You paid for the food. But I paid
you back!
(Lawrence stares)

I didn’t? No? Okay I didn’t do that! That’s on me, I’ll give you that! That’s my bad. But I was there the whole time-- I was a little bit late. I was tardy that day I remember now. Cause there had been traffic-- there was no traffic. I lied about that, I overslept. On accident. It was on purpose. I wanted to send a message, it was a power move. And I own that. That’s on me, as a man-- I did not act like a man.
(choked up)
I acted like a child. But after I got there. Late. I put in time. I left early. I was never there. I remember now. What had happened was I bailed. And you emailed me the verse. Now I remember! You had e-mailed it to me. Ohhh man. And I opened that email. Oh I’m owning this so hard right now. Opened up the email. You did a good job as I recall. Your temp was TIGHT. But guess who had to spell check it. You! Before you sent it. It was flawless! FLAWLESS, LAWRENCE! And I own that! HOWEVER. Your temp vocals were terrible. Your temp was pretty good. It was great. It was better than my verse. You wrote the whole verse for me. You wrote it. And I never gave you credit. Because no one ever asked. Because guess what? No one cares who writes things. They just care about who performed it. I mean, honestly, out of everybody on the whole fucking planet, the only person who has ever cared about who wrote it is YOU.

Conner finally stops, realizes what he’s said.
 
108.


LAWRENCE
Yep.

CONNER
God damnit... I’m sorry.

Lawrence nods.

LAWRENCE
Ok.

OWEN
(super happy)
See. That wasn’t so hard, right?

Should we get some lunch?

LAWRENCE
Sure, lemme just tell the guys.


INT. HILLSIDE - DAY

EN EL ACTO!

(This is Captain Dunn, I am taking the day off to hang with my friends from childhood. If anyone steals from me in my absence, they will be shot on sight.)

The guys are in shock.

SMASH CUT TO:

CONNER
Oh yeah, what was that? It had that crazy snare.

OWEN
Oh shit. Now she’s calling me.
(answers)
Hey, Paula! Yeah... yeah he’s here.

Conner talks to Paula. We subtitle her side.

PAULA

Where the hell have you been?

CONNER

CONNER
What? I thought they’re tonight.

OWEN/LAWRENCE

Let’s record this shit!

OWEN
What did Paula want?

CONNER
Nothing. They wanted me to do the
Pop Awards but I passed on that

shit. Should we record?

Owen and Lawrence stare at him.

OWEN/LAWRENCE
What??/ Why would you pass??

CONNER
I don’t wanna do that shit. I’m

hangin’ with you guys.

OWEN
I guess.

CONNER
Seriously, I’ve had more fun in the past day than in the last 3 years.

OWEN
Who cares! It’s the fuckin’ Poppys!

CONNER
It’s not important though. I’d

rather have my friends.
 
112.


LAWRENCE
That’s nice. But you could also do the Poppys.

CONNER
You don’t have to say that, guys.

LAWRENCE
Dude, you don’t have to choose
between your friends and being
successful. You can do both. Just

don’t be an asshole about it.

Conner takes this in. Looks to Owen.

OWEN
Do it, man, go. We’re good.

Conner is touched.

CONNER
Well, I’m not going alone.
