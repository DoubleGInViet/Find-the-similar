INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S – NIGHT
Compared to the interior, the exterior was that of a quaint English pub. Posters from 50's A.I.P. movies are all over the wall
("ROCK ALL NIGHT," "HIGH SCHOOL CONFIDENTIAL," "ATTACK OF THE CRAB MONSTER," and "MACHINE GUN KELLY"). The booths that the patrons sit in are made out of the cut up bodies of 50s cars.
In the middle of the restaurant in a dance floor. A big sign on the wall states, "No shoes allowed."So wannabe beboppers (actually Melrose-types), do the twist in their socks or barefeet.
The picture windows don't look out the street, but instead, B & W movies of 50's street scenes play behind them. The WAITRESSES and WAITERS are made up as replicas of 50's icons: MARILYN MONROE, ZORRO, JAMES DEAN, DONNA REED, MARTIN and LEWIS, and THE PHILIP MORRIS MIDGET, wait on tables wearing appropriate costumes.
Vincent and Mia study the menu in a booth made out of a red '59 Edsel. BUDDY HOLLY (their waiter), comes over, sporting a big button on his chest that says:"Hi I'm Buddy, pleasing you please me."
BUDDY
Hi I'm Buddy, what can I get'cha?
VINCENT
I'll have the Douglas Sirk steak.
BUDDY
How d'ya want it, burnt to a crisp, or
bloody as hell?
VINCENT
Bloody as hell. And to drink, a vanilla
coke.
BUDDY
How 'bout you, Peggy Sue?
MIA
I'll have the Durwood Kirby burger –
bloody – and a five-dollar shake.
BUDDY
How d'ya want that shake, Martin and
Lewis, or Amos and Andy?
MIA
Martin and Lewis.
VINCENT
Did you just order a five-dollar shake?
MIA
Sure did.
VINCENT
A shake? Milk and ice cream?
MIA
Uh-huh.
VINCENT
It costs five dollars?
BUDDY
Yep.
VINCENT
You don't put bourbon in it or anything?
BUDDY
Nope.
VINCENT
Just checking.
Buddy exits.
Vincent takes a look around the place. The YUPPIES are dancing, the DINERS are biting into big, juicy hamburgers, and the icons are playing their parts. Marilyn is squealing, The Midget is paging Philip Morris, Donna Reed is making her customers drink their milk, and Dean and Jerry are acting a fool.
MIA
Whaddya think?
VINCENT
It's like a wax museum with a pulse rate.
Vincent takes out his pouch of tobacco and begins rolling himself a smoke.
After a second of watching him –
MIA
What are you doing?
VINCENT
Rollin' a smoke.
MIA
Here?
VINCENT
It's just tobacco.
MIA
Oh. Well in that case, will you roll me
one, cowboy?
As he finishes licking it –
VINCENT
You can have his one, cowgirl.
He hands her the rolled smoke. She takes it, putting it to her lips. Out of nowhere appears a Zippo lighter in Vincent's hand. He lights it.
MIA
Thanks.
VINCENT
Think nothing of it.
He begins rolling one for himself.
As this time, the SOUND of a subway car fills the diner, making everything SHAKE and RATTLE. Marilyn Monroe runs to a square vent in the floor. An imaginary subway train BLOWS the skirt of her white dress around her ears as she lets out a squeal. The entire restaurant applauds.
Back to Mia and Vincent.
MIA
Marsellus said you just got back from
Amsterdam.
VINCENT
Sure did. I heard you did a pilot.
MIA
That was my fifteen minutes.
VINCENT
What was it?
MIA
It was show about a team of female secret agents called "Fox Force Five."
VINCENT
What?
MIA
"Fox Force Five."Fox, as in we're a bunch of foxy chicks. Force, as in we're a force to be reckoned with. Five, as in there's one...  two ...  three...  four...  five of us. There was a blonde one, Sommerset O'Neal from that show "Baton Rouge," she was the leader. A Japanese one, a black one, a French one and a brunette one, me. We all had special skills. Sommerset had a photographic memory, the Japanese fox was a kung fu master, the black girl was a demolition expert, the French fox' specialty was sex... 
VINCENT
What was your specialty?
MIA
Knives. The character I played, Raven McCoy, her background was she was raised by circus performers. So she grew up doing a knife act. According to the show, she was the deadliest woman in the world with a knife. But because she grew up in a circus, she was also something of an acrobat. She could do illusions, she was a trapeze artist – when you're keeping the world safe from evil, you never know when being a trapeze artist's gonna come in handy. And she knew a zillion old jokes her grandfather, an old vaudevillian, taught her. If we woulda got picked up, they woulda worked in a gimmick where every episode I woulda told and ol joke.
VINCENT
Do you remember any of the jokes?
MIA
Well I only got the chance to say one,
'cause we only did one show.
VINCENT
Tell me.
MIA
No. It's really corny.
VINCENT
C'mon, don't be that way.
MIA
No. You won't like it and I'll be
embarrassed.
VINCENT
You told it in front of fifty million
people and you can't tell it to me? I
promise I won't laugh.
MIA
(laughing)
That's what I'm afraid of.
VINCENT
That's not what I meant and you know it.
MIA
You're quite the silver tongue devil,
aren't you?
VINCENT
I meant I wouldn't laugh at you.
MIA
That's not what you said Vince. Well now I'm definitely not gonna tell ya, 'cause it's been built up too much.
VINCENT
What a gyp.
Buddy comes back with the drinks. Mia wraps her lips around the straw of her shake.
MIA
Yummy!
VINCENT
Can I have a sip of that? I'd like to know what a five-dollar shake tastes like.
MIA
Be my guest.
She slides the shake over to him.
MIA
You can use my straw, I don't have
kooties.
Vincent smiles.
VINCENT
Yeah, but maybe I do.
MIA
Kooties I can handle.
He takes a sip.
VINCENT
Goddamn! That's a pretty fuckin' good
milk shake.
MIA
Told ya.
VINCENT
I don't know if it's worth five dollars, but it's pretty fuckin' good.
He slides the shake back.
Then the first of an uncomfortable silence happens.
MIA
Don't you hate that?
VINCENT
What?
MIA
Uncomfortable silences. Why do we feel
it's necessary to yak about bullshit in
order to be comfortable?
VINCENT
I don't know.
MIA
That's when you know you found somebody special. When you can just shit the fuck up for a minute, and comfortably share silence.
VINCENT
I don't think we're there yet. But don't feel bad, we just met each other.
MIA
Well I'll tell you what, I'll go to the bathroom and powder my nose, while you sit here and think of something to say.
VINCENT
I'll do that.
INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (LADIES ROOM) – NIGHT
Mia powders her nose by doing a big line of coke off the bathroom sink. Her head jerks up from the rush.
MIA
(imitating Steppenwolf)
I said goddamn!
INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (DINING AREA) – NIGHT
Vincent digs into his Douglas Sirk steak. As he chews, his eyes scan the Hellsapopinish restaurant.
Mia comes back to the table.
MIA
Don't you love it when you go to the
bathroom and you come back to find your
food waiting for you?
VINCENT
We're lucky we got it at all. Buddy Holly doesn't seem to be much of a waiter. We shoulda sat in Marilyn Monroe's section.
MIA
Which one, there's two Marilyn Monroes.
VINCENT
No there's not.
Pointing at Marilyn in the white dress serving a table.
VINCENT
That's Marilyn Monroe... 
Then, pointing at a BLONDE WAITRESS in a tight sweater and capri pants, taking an order from a bunch of FILM GEEKS –
VINCENT
...  and that's Mamie Van Doren. I don't
see Jayne Mansfield, so it must be her
night off.
MIA
Pretty smart.
VINCENT
I have moments.
MIA
Did ya think of something to say?
VINCENT
Actually, there's something I've wanted to ask you about, but you seem like a nice person, and I didn't want to offend you.
MIA
Oooohhhh, this doesn't sound like mindless, boring, getting-to-know-you chit-chat. This sounds like you actually have something to say.
VINCENT
Only if you promise not to get offended.
MIA
You can't promise something like that. I have no idea what you're gonna ask. You could ask me what you're gonna ask me, and my natural response could be to be offended. Then, through no fault of my own, I woulda broken my promise.
VINCENT
Then let's just forget it.
MIA
That is an impossibility. Trying to forget anything as intriguing as this would be an exercise in futility.
VINCENT
Is that a fact?
Mia nods her head: "Yes."
MIA
Besides, it's more exciting when you don't have permission.
VINCENT
What do you think about what happened to
Antwan?
MIA
Who's Antwan?
VINCENT
Tony Rocky Horror.
MIA
He fell out of a window.
VINCENT
That's one way to say it. Another way is, he was thrown out. Another was is, he was thrown out by Marsellus. And even another way is, he was thrown out of a window by Marsellus because of you.
MIA
Is that a fact?
VINCENT
No it's not, it's just what I heard.
MIA
Who told you this?
VINCENT
They.
Mia and Vincent smile.
MIA
They talk a lot, don't they?
VINCENT
They certainly do.
MIA
Well don't by shyVincent, what exactly did they say?
Vincent is slow to answer.
MIA
Let me help you Bashful, did it involve
the F-word?
VINCENT
No. They just said Rocky Horror gave you a foot massage.
MIA
And... ?
VINCENT
No and, that's it.
MIA
You heard Marsellus threw Rocky Horror out of a four-story window because he massaged my feet?
VINCENT
Yeah.
MIA
And you believed that?
VINCENT
At the time I was told, it seemed
reasonable.
MIA
Marsellus throwing Tony out of a four-story window for giving me a foot massage seemed reasonable?
VINCENT
No, it seemed excessive. But that doesn't mean it didn't happen. I heard Marsellus is very protective of you.
MIA
A husband being protective of his wife is one thing. A husband almost killing another man for touching his wife's feet is something else.
VINCENT
But did it happen?
MIA
The only thing Antwan ever touched of mine was my hand, when he shook it. I met Anwan once – at my wedding – then never again.
The truth is, nobody knows why Marsellus tossed Tony Rocky Horror out of that window except Marsellus and Tony Rocky Horror. But when you scamps get together, you're worse than a sewing circle.
CUT TO:
ED SULLIVAN AND MARILYN MONROE STAND ON STAGE
ED SULLIVAN
(into microphone)
Ladies and gentlemen, now the moment
you've all been waiting for, the world-
famous Jackrabbit Slim's twist contest.
Patrons cheer.
Ed Sullivan is with Marilyn Monroe, who holds a trophy.
ED SULLIVAN
...  One lucky couple will win this
handsome trophy that Marilyn here is
holding.
Marilyn holds the trophy.
ED SULLIVAN
...  Now, who will be our first
contestants?
Mia holds her hand.
MIA
Right here.
Vincent reacts.
MIA
I wanna dance.
VINCENT
No, no, no no, no, no, no, no.
MIA
(overlapping)
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I do believe Marsellus, my husband, your boss, told you to take me out and do whatever I wanted, Now, I want to dance. I want to win. I want that trophy.
VINCENT
(sighs)
All right.
MIA
So, dance good.
VINCENT
All right, you asked for it.
Vincent and Mia walk onto the dance floor, toward Ed Sullivan.
ED SULLIVAN
(into microphone)
Let's hear it for our first contestants.
Patrons cheer.
Vincent and Mia walk up to the microphone.
ED SULLIVAN
Now let's meet our first contestants here this evening. Young lady, what is your name?
MIA
(into microphone)
Missus Mia Wallace.
ED SULLIVAN
(into microphone)
And, uh, how 'bout your fella here?
MIA
(into microphone)
Vincent Vega.
ED SULLIVAN
(into microphone)
All right, let's see what you can do. Take it away!
Mia and Vincent dance to Chuck Berry's "YOU NEVER CAN TELL". They make hand movements as they dance.
INT. MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOME – NIGHT
The front door FLINGS open, and Mia and Vincent dance tango-style into the house, singing a cappella the song from the previous scene. They finish their little dance, laughing.
Then... 
The two just stand face to face looking at each other.
VINCENT
Was than an uncomfortable silence?
MIA
I don't know what that was.
(pause)
Music and drinks!
Mia moves away to attend to both. Vincent hangs up his overcoat on a big bronze coat rack in the alcove.
VINCENT
I'm gonna take a piss.
MIA
That was a little bit more information
than I needed to know, but for right
ahead.
Vincent shuffles off to the john.
Mia moves to her CD player, thumbs through a stack of CDs and selects one: k.d. lang. The speakers BLAST OUT a high energy country number, which Mia plays air-guitar to. She dances her way around the room and finds herself by Vincent's overcoat hanging on the rack. She touches its sleeve. It feels good.
Her hand hoes in its pocket and pulls out his tobacco pouch. Like a little girl playing cowboy, she spreads the tobacco on some rolling paper. Imitating what he did earlier, licks the paper and rolls it into a pretty good cigarette. Maybe a little too fat, but not bad for a first try. Mia thinks so anyway. Her hand reaches back in the pocket and pulls out his Zippo lighter. She SLAPS the lighter against her leg, trying to light it fancy-style like Vince did. What do you know, she did it! Mia's one happy clam. She triumphantly brings the fat flame up to her fat smoke, lighting it up, then LOUDLY SNAPS the Zippo closed.
The Mia-made cigarette is brought up to her lips, and she takes a long, cool drag. Her hand slides the Zippo back in the overcoat pocket. But wait, her fingers touch something else. Those fingers bring out a plastic bag with white powder inside, the madman that Vincent bought earlier from Lance. Wearing a big smile, Mia brings the bag of heroin up to her face.
MIA
(like you would say Bingo!) Disco! Vince, you little cola nut, you've been holding out on me.
CUT TO:
INT. BATHROOM (MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOUSE) – NIGHT
Vincent stands at the sink, washing his hands, talking to himself in the mirror.
VINCENT
One drink and leave. Don't be rude, but drink your drink quickly, say goodbye, walk out the door, get in your car, and go down the road.
LIVING ROOM
Mia has the unbeknownst-to-her heroin cut up into big lines on her glass top coffee table. Taking her trusty hundred dollar bill like a human Dust-Buster, she quickly snorts the fat line.
CLOSEUP – MIA
Her head JERKS back. Her hands go to her nose (which feels like it's on fucking fire), something is terribly wrong. Then...  the rush hits... 
BATHROOM
Vincent dries his hands on a towel while he continues his dialogue with the mirror.
VINCENT
...  It's a moral test of yourself, whether or not you can maintain loyalty. Because when people are loyal to each other, that's very meaningful.
LIVING ROOM
Mia is on all fours trying to crawl to the bathroom, but it's like she's trying to crawl with the bones removed from her knees. Blood begins to drip from Mia's nose. Then her stomach gets into the act and she VOMITS.
BATHROOM
Vince continues.
VINCENT
So you're gonna go out there, drink your drink, say "Goodnight, I've had a very lovely evening," go home, and jack off. And that's all you're gonna do.
Now that he's given himself a little pep talk, Vincent's ready for whatever's waiting for him on the other side of that door. So he goes through it.
LIVING ROOM
We follow behind Vincent as he walks from the bathroom to the living room, where he finds Mia lying on the floor like a rag doll. She's twisted on her back. Blood and puke are down her front. And her face is contorted. Not out of the tightness of pain, but just the opposite, the muscles in her face are so relaxed, she lies still with her mouth wide open. Slack-jawed.
VINCENT
Jesus Christ!
Vincent moves like greased lightning to Mia's fallen body. Bending down where she lays, he puts his fingers on her neck to check her pulse. She slightly stirs.
Mia is aware of Vincent over her, speaking to her.
VINCENT
(sounding weird)
Mia! MIA! What the hell happened?
But she's unable to communicate Mia makes a few lost mumbles, but they're not distinctive enough to be called words.
Vincent props her eyelids open and sees the story.
VINCENT
(to himself)
I'll be a son-of-a-bitch.
(to Mia)
Mia! MIA! What did you take? Answer me
honey, what did you take?
Mia is incapable of answering. He SLAPS her face hard.
Vincent SPRINGS up and RUNS to his overcoat, hanging on the rack. He goes through the pockets FRANTICALLY. It's gone. Vincent makes a beeline to Mia. We follow.
VINCENT
(yelling toMia)
Okay honey, we're getting you on your
feet.
He reaches her and hoists the dead weight up in his arms.
VINCENT
We're on our feet now, and now we're gonna talk out to the car. Here we go, watch us walk.
We follow behind as he hurriedly walks the practically-unconscious Mia through the house and out the front door.
EXT.VINCENT'S HOT ROD (MOVING) – NIGHT
INSERT SPEEDOMETER: red needle on a hundred.
Vincent driving like a madman in a town without traffic laws, speeds the car into turns and up and over hills.
INT.VINCENT'S HOT ROD (MOVING) – NIGHT
Vincent, one hand firmly on the wheel, the other shifting like Robocop, both eyes staring straight ahead except when he glances over at Mia.
Mia, slack-jawed expression, mouth gaping, posture of a bag of water.
Vincent takes a cellular phone out of his pocket. He punches a number.
INT. LANCE'S HOUSE – NIGHT
At this late hour, LANCE has transformed from a bon vivant drug dealer to a bathrobe creature.
He sits in a big comfy chair, ratty blue gym pants, a worn-out but comfortable tee-shirt that has, written on it, "TAFT, CALIFORNIA", and a moth-ridden terry cloth robe. In his hand is a bowl of Cap'n Crunch with Crunch Berries. In front of him on the coffee table is a jug of milk, the box the Cap'n Crunch with Crunch Berries came out of, and a hash pipe in an ashtray.
On the big-screen TV in front of the table is the Three Stooges, and they're getting married.
PREACHER (EMIL SIMKUS)
(on TV)
Hold hands, you love birds.
The phone RINGS.
Lance puts down his cereal and makes his way to the phone.
It RINGS again.
Jody, his wife, CALLS from the bedroom, obviously woken up.
JODY (O.S.)
Lance! The phone's ringing!
LANCE
(calling back)
I can hear it!
JODY (O.S.)
I thought you told those fuckin' assholes never to call this late!
LANCE
(by the phone)
I told 'em and that's what I'm gonna tell this fuckin' asshole right now!
(he answers the phone)
Hello, do you know how late it is? You're not supposed to be callin' me this fuckin' late.
BACK TO:
VINCENT IN THE MALIBU
Vincent is still driving like a stripe-assed ape, clutching the phone to his ear. WE CUT BACK AND FORTH during the conversation.
VINCENT
Lance, this is Vincent, I'm in big fuckin' trouble man, I'm on my way to your place.
LANCE
Whoa, hold you horses man, what's the
problem?
VINCENT
You still got an adrenalin shot?
LANCE
(dawning on him)
Maybe.
VINCENT
I need it man, I got a chick she's fuckin'
ODing on me.
LANCE
Don't bring her here! I'm not even fuckin' joking with you, don't you be bringing some fucked up pooh-butt to my house!
VINCENT
No choice.
LANCE
She's ODin'?
VINCENT
Yeah. She's dyin'.
LANCE
Then bite the fuckin' bullet, take 'er to a hospital and call a lawyer!
VINCENT
Negative.
LANCE
She ain't my fuckin' problem, you fucked her up, you deal with it – are you talkin' to me on a cellular phone?
VINCENT
Sorry.
LANCE
I don't know you, who is this, don't come here, I'm hangin' up.
VINCENT
Too late, I'm already here.
At that moment insideLance's house, WE HEARVINCENT's Malibu coming up the street. Lance hangs up the phone, goes to his curtains and
YANKS the cord. The curtains open with a WHOOSH in time to see Vincent's Malibu DRIVING UP on his front lawn and CRASHING into his house. The window Lance is looking out of SHATTERS from the impact.
JODY (O.S.)
What the hell was that?
Lance CHARGES from the window, out the door to his front lawn.
EXT. LANCE'S HOUSE – NIGHT
Vincent is already out of the car, working on getting Mia out.
LANCE
Have you lost your mind?! You crashed your car in my fuckin' house! You talk about drug shit on a cellular fuckin' phone –
VINCENT
If you're through havin' your little hissy fit, this chick is dyin', get your needle and git it now!
LANCE
Are you deaf? You're not bringin' that
fucked up bitch in my house!
VINCENT
This fucked up bitch is Marsellus Wallace's wife. Now if she fuckin' croaks on me, I'm a grease spot. But before he turns me into a bar soap, I'm gonna be forced to tell 'im about how you coulda saved her life, but instead you let her die on your front lawn.
INT. LANCE'S HOUSE – NIGHT
WE START in Lance's and Jody's bedroom.
Jody, in bed, throws off the covers and stands up. She's wearing a long tee-shirt with a picture of Fred Flintstone on it.
We follow HANDHELD behind her as she opens the door, walking through the hall into the living room.
JODY
It's only one-thirty in the goddamn
mornin'! What the fuck's goin' on out
here?
As she walks in the living room, she sees Vincent and Lance standing over Mia, who's lying on the floor in the middle of the room.
From here on in, everything in this scene is frantic, like a DOCUMENTARY in an emergency ward, with the big difference here being nobody knows what the fuck they're doing.
JODY
Who's she?
Lance looks up at Jody.
LANCE
Get that black box in the bedroom I have with the adrenalin shot.
JODY
What's wrong with her?
VINCENT
She's ODing on us.
JODY
Well get her the hell outta here!
LANCE ANDVINCENT
(in stereo)
Get the fuckin' shot!
JODY
Don't yell and me!
She angrily turns and disappears into the bedroom looking for the shot.
WE MOVE into the room with the two men.
VINCENT
(to Lance)
You two are a match made in heaven.
LANCE
Look, just keep talkin' to her, okay? While she's gettin' the shot, I gotta get a medical book.
VINCENT
What do you need a medical book for?
LANCE
To tell me how to do it. I've never given an adrenalin shot before.
VINCENT
You've had that thing for six years and
you never used it?
LANCE
I never had to use it. I don't go joy-
poppin' with bubble-gummers, all of
myfriends can handle their highs!
VINCENT
Well then get it.
LANCE
I am, if you'll let me.
VINCENT
I'm not fuckin' stoppin' you.
LANCE
Stop talkin' to me, and start talkin' to her.
WE FOLLOW Lance as he runs out of the living room into a... 
INT. SPARE ROOM
With a bunch of junk in it. He frantically starts scanning the junk for the book he's looking for, repeating the words, "Come on," endlessly.
From OFF SCREEN we hear:
VINCENT (O.S.)
Hurry up man! We're losin' her!
LANCE
(calling back)
I'm looking as fast as I can!
Lance continues his frenzied search.
WE HEAR Jody in the living room now as she talks to Vincent.
JODY (O.S.)
What's he lookin' for?
VINCENT (O.S.)
I dunno, some medical book.
Jody calls to LANCE.
JODY (O.S.)
What are you lookin' for?
LANCE
My black medical book!
As he continues searching, flipping and knocking over shit, Jody appears in the doorway.
JODY
Whata re you looking for?
LANCE
My black fuckin' medical book. It's like a text book they give to nurses.
JODY
I never saw a medical book.
LANCE
Trust me, I have one.
JODY
Well if it's that important, why didn't
you keep it with the shot?
Lance spins toward her.
LANCE
I don't know! Stop bothering me!
JODY
While you're lookin' for it, that girl's gonna die on our carpet. You're never gonna find it in all this shit. For six months now, I've been telling you to clean this room –
VINCENT (O.S.)
– get your ass in here, fuck the book!
Lance angrily knocks over a pile of shit and leaves the SHOT heading for the living room.
LIVING ROOM
Vincent is bent over Mia, talking softly to her, when Lance reenters the room.
VINCENT
Quit fuckin' around man and give her the shot!
Lance bends down by the black case brought in by Jody. He opens it and begins preparing the needle for injection.
LANCE
While I'm doing this, take her shirt off and find her heart.
Vince rips her blouse open.
Jody stumbles back in the room, hanging back from the action.
VINCENT
Does it have to be exact?
LANCE
Yeah, it has to be exact! I'm giving her an injection in the heart, so I gotta exactly hit her in the heart.
VINCENT
Well, I don't know exactly where her heart is, I think it's here.
Vince points to Mia's right breast.Lance glances over and nods.
LANCE
That's it.
As Lance readies the injection, Vincent looks up at Jody.
VINCENT
I need a big fat magic marker, got one?
JODY
What?
VINCENT
I need a big fat magic marker, any felt
pen'll do, but a magic marker would be
great.
JODY
Hold on.
Jody runs to the desk, opens the top drawer and, in her enthusiasm, she pulls the drawer out of the desk, the contents of which (bills, papers, pens) spill to the floor.
The injection is ready. Lance hands Vincent the needle.
LANCE
It's ready, I'll tell you what to do.
VINCENT
You're gonna give her the shot.
LANCE
No, you're gonna give her the shot.
VINCENT
I've never does this before.
LANCE
I've never done this before either, and I ain't starting now. You brought 'er here, that means you give her the shot. The day I bring an ODing bitch to your place, then I gotta give her the shot.
Jody hurriedly joins them in the huddle, a big fat red magic marker in her hand.
JODY
Got it.
Vincent grabs the magic marker out of Jody's hand and makes a big red dot inMIA's body where her heart is.
VINCENT
Okay, what do I do?
LANCE
Well, you're giving her an injection of adrenalin straight to her heart. But she's got a breast plate in front of her heart, so you gotta pierce through that. So what you gotta do is bring the needle down in a stabbing motion.
Lance demonstrates a stabbing motion, which looks like "The Shape" killing its victims in "HALLOWEEN".
VINCENT
I gotta stab her?
LANCE
If you want the needle to pierce through to her heart, you gotta stab her hard. Then once you do, push down on the plunger.
VINCENT
What happens after that?
LANCE
I'm curious about that myself.
VINCENT
This ain't a fuckin' joke man!
LANCE
She's supposed to come out of it like –
(snaps his fingers)
– that.
Vincent lifts the needle up above his head in a stabbing motion.
He looks down on Mia.
Mia is fading fast. Soon nothing will help her.
Vincent's eyes narrow, ready to do this.
VINCENT
Count to three.
Lance, on this knees right beside Vincent, does not know what to expect.
LANCE
One... 
RED DOT on Mia's body.
Needle raised ready to strike.
LANCE (O.S.)
...  two... 
Jody's face is alive with anticipation.
NEEDLE in that air, poised like a rattler ready to strike.
LANCE (O.S.)
...  three!
The needle leaves frame, THRUSTING down hard.
Vincent brings the needle down hard, STABBING Mia in the chest.
Mia's head if JOLTED from the impact.
The syringe plunger is pushed down, PUMPING the adrenalin out through the needle.
Mia's eyes POP WIDE OPEN and she lets out a HELLISH cry of the banshee. She BOLTS UP in a sitting position, needle stuck in her chest – SCREAMING.
Vincent, Lance and Jody, who were in sitting positions in front of Mia, JUMP BACK, scared to death.
Mia's scream runs out. She slowly starts taking breaths of air.
The other three, now scooted halfway across the room, shaken to their bones, look to see if she's alright.
LANCE
If you're okay, say something.
Mia, still breathing, not looking up at them, says in a relatively normal voice.
MIA
Something.
Vincent and Lance collapse on their backs, exhausted and shaking from how close to death Mia came.

Anybody want a beer?
CUT TO:
INT. VINCENT'S MALIBU (MOVING) – NIGHT
Vincent is behind the wheel driving Mia home. No one says anything, both are still too shaken.
EXT. FRONT OF MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOUSE – NIGHT
The Malibu pulls up to the front. Mia gets out without saying a word (still in a daze) and begins walking down the walkway toward her front door.
VINCENT (O.S.)
Mia!
She turns around.
Vincent's out of the car, standing on the walkway, a big distance between the two.
VINCENT
What are your thoughts on how to handle
this?
MIA
What's yours?
VINCENT
Well I'm of the opinion that Marsellus can live his whole live and never ever hear of this incident.
Mia smiles.
MIA
Don't worry about it. If Marsellus ever heard of this, I'd be in as much trouble as you.
VINCENT
I seriously doubt that.
MIA
If you can keep a secret, so can I.
VINCENT
Let's shake on it.
The two walk toward each other, holding out their hands to shake and shake they do.
VINCENT
Mum's the word.
Mia lets go of Vincent's hand and silently makes the see-no-evil, hear-no-evil, and speak-no-evil sign with her hands.
Vincent smiles.
VINCENT
If you'll excuse me, I gotta go home and have a heart attack.
Mia giggles.
Vincent turns to leave.
MIA
You still wanna hear my "FOX FORCE FIVE"
joke?
Vincent turns around.
VINCENT
Sure, but I think I'm still a little too petrified to laugh.
MIA
Uh-huh. You won't laugh because it's not
funny. But if you still wanna hear it,
I'll tell it.
VINCENT
I can't wait.
MIA
Three tomatoes are walking down the street, a poppa tomato, a momma tomato, and a little baby tomato. The baby tomato is lagging behind the poppa and momma tomato. The poppa tomato gets mad, goes over to the momma tomato and stamps on him –
(stamps on the ground)
– and says: catch up. They both smile, but neither laugh.
MIA
See ya 'round, Vince.
Mia turns and walks inside her house.
CLOSEUP – VINCENT
After Mia walks inside. Vincent continues to look at where she was. He brings his hands to his lips and blows her a kiss. Then exits FRAME leaving it empty. WE HEAR his Malibu START UP and DRIVE AWAY.

On the cartoon "SPEED RACER." Speed is giving a detailed description of all the features on his race car "The Mac-5," which he does at the beginning of every episode.
OFF SCREEN we hear a WOMAN'S VOICE...  .
WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
Butch.
DISSOLVE TO:
BUTCH'S POV
We're in the living room of a modest two bedroom house in Alhambra, California, in the year 1972. BUTCH'S MOTHER, 35ish, stands in the doorway leading into the living room. Next to her is a man dressed in the uniform of an American Air Force officer. The CAMERA is the perspective of a five-year old boy.
MOTHER
Butch, stop watching TV a second. We got a special visitor. Now do you remember when I told you your daddy dies in a P.O.W. camp?
BUTCH (O.S.)
Uh-huh.
MOTHER
Well this here is Capt. Koons. He was in the P.O.W. camp with Daddy.
CAPT. KOONS steps inside the room toward the little boy and bends down on one knee to bring him even ith the boy's eyeline. When Koons speaks, he speaks with a slight Texas accent.
CAPT. KOONS
Hello, little man. Boy I sure heard a bunch about you. See, I was a good friend of your Daddy's. We were in that Hanoi pit of hell over five years together. Hopefully, you'll never have to experience this yourself, but when two men are in a situation like me and your Daddy were, for as long as we were, you take on certain responsibilities of the other. If it had been me who had not made it, Major Coolidge would be talkin' right now to my son Jim. But the way it worked out is I'm talkin' to you, Butch. I got somethin' for ya.
The Captain pulls a gold wrist watch out of his pocket.
CAPT. KOONS
This watch I got here was first purchased by your great-granddaddy. It was bought during the First World War in a little general store in Knoxville, Tennessee. It was bought by private Doughboy Ernie Coolidge the day he set sail for Paris. It was your great-granddaddy's war watch, made by the first company to ever make wrist watches. You see, up until then, people just carried pocket watches. Your great-granddaddy wore that watch every day he was in the war. Then when he had done his duty, he went home to your great-grandmother, took the watch off his wrist and put it in an ol' coffee can. And in that can it stayed 'til your grandfather Dane Coolidge was called upon by his country to go overseas and fight the Germans once again. This time they called it World War Two. Your great-granddaddy gave it to your granddad for good luck. Unfortunately, Dane's luck wasn't as good as his old man's. Your granddad was a
(MORE)
CAPT. KOONS (CONT'D)
Marine and he was killed with all the
other Marines at the battle of Wake
Island. Your granddad was facing death and
he knew it. None of those boys had any
illusions about ever leavin' that island
alive. So three days before the Japanese
took the island, your 22-year old
grandfather asked a gunner on an Air Force
transport named Winocki, a man he had
never met before in his life, to deliver
to his infant son, who he had never seen
in the flesh, his gold watch. Three days
later, your grandfather was dead. But
Winocki kept his word. After the war was
over, he paid a visit to your grandmother,
delivering to your infant father, his
Dad's gold watch. This watch. This watch
was on your Daddy's wrist when he was shot
down over Hanoi. He was captured and put
in a Vietnamese prison camp. Now he knew
if the gooks ever saw the watch it's be
confiscated. The way your Daddy looked at
it, that watch was your birthright. And
he'd be damned if and slopeheads were
gonna put their greasy yella hands on his
boy's birthright. So he hid it in the one
place he knew he could hide somethin'. His
ass. Five long years, he wore this watch
up his ass. Then when he died of
disentary, he gave me the watch. I hid
with uncomfortable hunk of metal up my ass
for two years. Then, after seven years, I
was sent home to my family. And now,
little man, I give the watch to you.
Capt. Koons hands the watch to Butch. A little hand comes into FRAME to accept it.
CUT TO:
INT. LOCKER ROOM – NIGHT
The 27-year old Butch Coolidge is dressed in boxing regalia: trunks, shoes and gloves. He lies on a table catching a few zzzzzz's before his big fight. Almost as soon as WE CUT to him, he wakes up with a start. Shaken by the bizarre memory, he wipes his sweaty face with his boxing glove.
His trainer KLONDIKE, an older fireplug, opens the door a little, sticking his head in the room. Pandemonium seems to be breaking out behind Klondike in the hallway.
KLONDIKE
It's time, Butch.
BUTCH
I'm ready.
Klondike steps inside, closing the door on the WILD MOB outside. He goes to the long yellow robe hanging on a hook. Butch hops off the table and, without a word, Klondike helps him on with the robe, which says on the back: "BATTLING BUTCH COOLIDGE".
The two men head for the door. Klondike opens the door for Butch. As Butch steps into the hallway, the Crowd goes apeshit. Klondike closes the door behind him, leaving us in the quiet, empty locker room.

– Well Dan, that had to be the bloodiest and, hands-down, the most brutal fight this city has ever seen.
The SOUND of chaos in the b.g.
FADE IN:
EXT. ALLEY (RAINING) – NIGHT
A taxi is parked in a dark alley next to an auditorium. The sky is PISSIN' DOWN RAIN. WE SLOWLY DOLLY toward the parked car. The SOUND of the CAR RADIO can be heard coming from inside.
SPORTSCASTER #1 (O.S.)
...  Coolidge was out of there faster than I've ever seen a victorious boxer vacate the ring. Do you think he knew Willis was dead?
SPORTSCASTER #2 (O.S.)
My guess would be yes, Richard. I could see from my position here, the frenzy in his eyes give way to the realization of what he was doing. I think any man would've left the ring that fast.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. TAXI (PARKED/RAINING) – NIGHT
Inside the taxi, behind the wheel, is a female cabbie named ESMARELDA VILLALOBOS. A young woman, with Spanish looks, sits parked, drinking a steaming hot cup of coffee out of a white styrofoam cup.
The Sportscasters continue their coverage.
SPORTSCASTER #1 (O.S.)
Do you feel this ring death tragedy will have an effect on the world of boxing?
SPORTSCASTER #2 (O.S.)
Oh Dan, a tragedy like this can't help but shake the world of boxing to its very foundation. But it's of paramount importance that during the sad weeks ahead, the eyes of the W.B.A. remain firmly fixed on the – CLICK –
Esmarelda shuts off the radio.
She takes a sip of coffee, then hears a NOISE behind her in the alley. She sticks her head out of the car door to see:
EXT. BOXING AUDITORIUM (RAINING) – NIGHT
A window about three stories high opens on the auditorium-side of the alley. A gym bag is tossed out into a garbage dumpster below the window. Then, Butch Coolidge, still dressed in boxing trunks, shoes, gloves and yellow robe, LEAPS to the dumpster below.
ESMARELDA'S REACTION takes in the strangeness of this sight.
Gym bag in hand, Butch CLIMBS out of the dumpster and RUNS to the taxi. Before he climbs in, he takes off his robe and throws it to the ground.
INT. TAXI (PARKED / RAINING) – NIGHT
Butch, soaking wet, naked except for trunks, shoes and gloves, HOPS in the backseat, SLAMMING the door.
Esmarelda, staring straight ahead, talks to Butch through the rearview mirror:
ESMARELDA
(Spanish accent)
Are you the man I was supposed to pick up?
BUTCH
If you're the cab I called, I'm the guy
you're supposed to pick up.
ESMARELDA
Where to?
BUTCH
Outta here.
The ignition key is TWISTED. The engine ROARS to life.
The meter is FLIPPED on.
Esmarelda's bare foot STOMPS on the gas pedal.
EXT. BOXING AUDITORIUM (RAINING) – NIGHT
The cab WHIPS out of the alley, FISH-TAILING on the wet pavement in front of the auditorium at a rapid pace.
INT. WILLIS LOCKER ROOM (AUDITORIUM) – NIGHT
Locker room door opens, Enghlish Dave fights his way through the pandemonium which is going on outside in the hall, shutting the door on the madness. Once inside, English Dave takes time to adjust his suit and tie. Mia is standing by the door. She sees Vincent with English Dave.
VINCENT
Mia. How you doin'?
MIA
Great. I never thanked you for the dinner.
In the room, black boxer FLOYD RAY WILLIS lies on a table – dead. His face looks like he went dunking for bees. His TRAINER is on his knees, head on Floyd's chest, crying over the body.
The huge figure that is Marsellus Wallace stands at the table, hand on the Trainer's shoulder, lending emotional support. We still do not see Marsellus clearly, only that he is big.
Mia sits in a chair at the far end of the room.
Marsellus looks up, sees English Dave and walks over to him.
MARSELLUS (O.S.)
What'cha got?
ENGLISH DAVE
He booked.
MARSELLUS (O.S.)
I'm prepared to scour the earth for this motherfucker. If Butch goes to Indo China, I want a nigger hidin' in a bowl of rice, ready to pop a cap in his ass.
ENGLISH DAVE
I'll take care of it.
INT. CAB (MOVING / RAINING) – NIGHT
Butch gets one of his boxing gloves off.
Esmeralda watches in the rearview mirror.
He tries to roll down one of the backseat windows, but can't find the roll bar.
