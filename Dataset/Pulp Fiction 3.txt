BUTCH
Hey, how do I open the window back here?
ESMARELDA
I have to do it.
She presses a button and the back window moves down. Butch tosses his boxing glove out the window, then starts untying the other one.
Esmeralda can't keep quiet anymore.
ESMARELDA
Hey, mister?
BUTCH
(still working on the glove)
What?
ESMARELDA
You were in that fight? The fight on the radio – you're the fighter?
As he tosses his other glove out the window.
BUTCH
Whatever gave you that idea?
ESMARELDA
No c'mon, you're him, I know you're him, tell me you're him.
BUTCH
(drying himself with a gym towel)
I'm him.
ESMARELDA
You killed the other boxing man.
BUTCH
He's dead?
ESMARELDA
The radio said he was dead.
He finished wiping himself down.
BUTCH
(to himself)
Sorry 'bout that, Floyd.
He tosses the towel out the window.
Silence, as Butch digs in his bag for a t-shirt.
ESMARELDA
What does it feel like?
BUTCH
(finds his shirt)
What does what feel like?
ESMARELDA
Killing a man. Beating another man to
death with your bare hands.
Butch pulls on his tee-shirt.
BUTCH
Are you some kinda weirdo?
ESMARELDA
No, it's a subject I have much interest in. You are the first person I ever met who has killed somebody. So, what was it like to kill a man?
BUTCH
Tell ya what, you give me one of them
cigarettes, I'll give you an answer.
Esmarelda bounces in her seat with excitment.
ESMARELDA
Deal!
Butch leans forward. Esmarelda, keeping her eyes on the road, passes a cigarette back to him. He takes it. Then, still not looking behind her, she brings up her hand, a lit match in it. Butch lights his smoke, then blows out the match.
He takes a long drag.
BUTCH
So... 
He looks at her license
BUTCH
...  Esmarelda Villalobos – is that
Mexican?
ESMARELDA
The name is Spanish, but I'm Columbian.
BUTCH
It's a very pretty name.
ESMARELDA
It mean "Esmarelda of the wolves."
BUTCH
That's one hell of a name you got there, sister.
ESMARELDA
Thank you. And what is your name?
BUTCH
Butch.
ESMARELDA
Butch. What does it mean?
BUTCH
I'm an American, our names don't mean shit. Anyway, moving right along, what is it you wanna know, Esmarelda?
ESMARELDA
I want to know what it feels like to kill a man –
BUTCH
– I couldn't tell ya. I didn't know he was dead 'til you told me he was dead. Now I know he's dead, do you wanna know how I feel about it?
Esmarelda nods her head: "yes."
BUTCH
I don't feel the least little bit bad.
EXT. PHONE BOOTH (RAINING) – NIGHT
We DOLLY around a phone booth as Butch talks inside.
BUTCH
(into phone)
What's I tell ya, soon as the word got out a fix was in, the odds would be outta control. Hey, if he was a better fighter he's be alive. If he never laced up his gloves in the first place, which he never shoulda done, he'd be alive. Enough about the poor unfortunate Mr. Floyd, let's talk about the rich and prosperous Mr. Butch. How many bookies you spread it around with?
(pause)
Eight? How long to collect?
(pause)
So by tomorrow evening, you'll have it
all?
(pause)
Good news Scotty, real good news – I understand a few stragglers aside. Me an' Fabienne're gonna leave in the morning. It should take us a couple days to get into Knoxville. Next time we see each other, it'll be on Tennessee time.
Butch hangs up the phone. He looks at the cab waiting to take him wherever he wants to go.
BUTCH
(to himself in French with English
subtitles)
Fabienne my love, our adventure begins.
CUT TO:
EXT. MOTEL (STOPPED / RAINING) – NIGHT
Esmeralda's taxi pulled into the motel parking lot. The rain has stopped, but the night is still soaked. Butch gets out, now fully dressed in tee-shirt, jeans and high school athletic jacket. He leans in the driver's side window.
ESMARELDA
Forty-five sixty.
Handing her the money.
BUTCH
Merci beaucoup. And here's a little
something for the effort.
Butch holds up a hundred dollar bill.
Esmarelda's eyes light up. She goes to take it. Butch holds it out of reach.
BUTCH
Now if anybody should ask you about who your fare was tonight, what're you gonna tell 'em?
ESMARELDA
The truth. Three well-dressed, slightly
toasted, Mexicans.
He gives her the bill.
BUTCH
Bon soir, Esmarelda.
ESMARELDA
(in Spanish)
Sleep well, Butch.
He tweaks her nose, she smiles, and he turns and walks away. She drives off.
INT. MOTEL (ROOM SIX) – NIGHT
Butch enters and turns on the light.
Lying curled up on the bed, fully dressed, with her back to us is Butch's French girlfriend, FABIENNE.
FABIENNE
Keep the light off.
Butch flicks the switch back, making the room dark again.
BUTCH
Is that better, sugar pop?
FABIENNE
Oui. Hard day at the office?
BUTCH
Pretty hard. I got into a fight.
FABIENNE
Poor baby. Can we make spoons?
Butch climbs into bed, spooning Fabienne from behind.
When Butch and Fabienne speak to each other, they speak in baby-talk.
FABIENNE
I was looking at myself in the mirror.
BUTCH
Uh-huh?
FABIENNE
I wish I had a pot.
BUTCH
You were lookin' in the mirror and you
wish you had some pot?
FABIENNE
A pot. A pot belly. Pot bellies are sexy.
BUTCH
Well you should be happy, 'cause you do.
FABIENNE
Shut up, Fatso! I don't have a pot! I have a bit of a tummy, like Madonna when she did "Lucky Star," it's not the same thing.
BUTCH
I didn't realize there was a difference
between a tummy and a pot belly.
FABIENNE
The difference is huge.
BUTCH
You want me to have a pot?
FABIENNE
No. Pot bellies make a man look either oafish, or like a gorilla. But on a woman, a pot belly is very sexy. The rest of you is normal. Normal face, normal legs, normal hips, normal ass, but with a big, perfectly round pot belly. If I had one, I'd wear a tee-shirt two sizes too small to accentuate it.
BUTCH
You think guys would find that attractive?
FABIENNE
I don't give a damn what men find attractive. It's unfortunate what we find pleasing to the touch and pleasing to the eye is seldom the same.
BUTCH
If I had a pot belly, I'd punch you in it.
FABIENNE
You'd punch me in my belly?
BUTCH
Right in the belly.
FABIENNE
I'd smother you. I'd drop it on your right on your face 'til you couldn't breathe.
BUTCH
You'd do that to me?
FABIENNE
Yes!
BUTCH
Did you get everything, sugar pop?
FABIENNE
Yes, I did.
BUTCH
Good job.
FABIENNE
Did everything go as planned?
BUTCH
You didn't listen to the radio?
FABIENNE
I never listen to your fights. Were you
the winner?
BUTCH
I won alright.
FABIENNE
Are you still retiring?
BUTCH
Sure am.
FABIENNE
What about the man you fought?
BUTCH
Floyd retired too.
FABIENNE
(smiling)
Really?! He won't be fighting no more?!
BUTCH
Not no more.
FABIENNE
So it all worked out in the finish?
BUTCH
We ain't at the finish, baby.
Fabienne rolls over and Butch gets on top of her. They kiss.
FABIENNE
We're in a lot of danger, aren't we?
Butch nods his head: "yes."
FABIENNE
If they find us, they'll kill us, won't
they?
Butch nods his head: "yes."
FABIENNE
But they won't find us, will they?
Butch nods his head: "no."
FABIENNE
Do you still want me to go with you?
Butch nods his head: "yes."
FABIENNE
I don't want to be a burden or a nuisance
–
Butch's hand goes out of frame and starts massaging her crotch.
Fabienne reacts.
FABIENNE
Say it!
BUTCH
Fabienne, I want you to be with me.
FABIENNE
Forever?
BUTCH
...  and ever.
Fabienne lies her head back.
Butch continues to massage her crotch.
FABIENNE
Do you love me?
BUTCH
Oui.
FABIENNE
Butch? Will you give me oral pleasure?
Butch kisses her on the mouth.
BUTCH
Will you kiss it?
She nods her head: "yes."
FABIENNE
But you first.
Butch's head goes down out of frame to carry out the oral pleasure. Fabienne's face is alone in the frame.
FABIENNE
(in French, with English
subtitles)
Butch my love, the adventure begins.
FADE TO BLACK
FADE UP:
MOTEL ROOM
Same motel room, except empty. WE HEAR THE SHOWER RUNNING in the bathroom. The CAMERA MOVES to the bathroom doorway. We see Fabienne in a white terry cloth robe that seems to swallow her up. She's drying her head with a towel. Butch is inside the shower washing up. We see the outline of his naked body through the smoky glass of the shower door. Steam fills the bathroom. Butch turns the shower off and opens the door, popping his head out.
BUTCH
I think I cracked a rib.
FABIENNE
Giving me oral pleasure?
BUTCH
No retard, from the fight.
FABIENNE
Don't call me retard.
BUTCH
(in a Mongoloid voice)
My name is Fabby! My name is Fabby!
FABIENNE
Shut up fuck head! I hate that Mongoloid voice.
BUTCH
Okay, sorry, sorry, sorry, I take it back!
Can I have a towel please, Miss Beautiful
Tulip.
FABIENNE
Oh I like that, I like being called a
tulip. Tulip is much better than
Mongoloid.
She finishes drying her hair and wraps the towel like a turban on her head.
BUTCH
I didn't call you a Mongoloid, I called
you a retard, but I took it back.
She hands him a towel.
BUTCH
Merci beaucoup.
FABIENNE
Butch?
BUTCH
(drying his head)
Yes, lemon pie.
FABIENNE
Where are we going to go?
BUTCH
I'm not sure yet. Wherever you want. We're gonna get a lot of money from this. But it ain't gonna be so much, we can live like hogs in the fat house forever. I was thinking we could go somewhere in the South Pacific. The kinda money we'll have'll carry us a long way down there.
FABIENNE
So if we wanted, we could live in Bora
Bora?
BUTCH
You betcha. And if after awhile you don't dig Bora Bora, then we can move over to Tahiti or Mexico.
FABIENNE
But I do not speak Spanish.
BUTCH
You don't speak Bora Boran either.
Besides, Mexican is easy: Donde esta el
zapataria?
FABIENNE
What does that mean?
BUTCH
Where's the shoe store?
FABIENNE
Donde esta el zapataria?
BUTCH
Excellent pronunciation. You'll be my
little mama ceta in no time.
Butch exits the bathroom. We stay on Fabienne as she brushes her teeth.
Butch keeps on from the other room.
BUTCH (O.S.)
Que hora es?
FABIENNE
Que hora es?
BUTCH (O.S.)
What time is it?
FABIENNE
What time is it?
BUTCH (O.S.)
Time for bed. Sweet dream, jellybean.
Fabienne brushes her teeth. We watch her for a moment or two, then she remember something.
FABIENNE
Butch.
She walks out of the bathroom to ask Butch a question, only to find him sound asleep in bed.
She looks at him for a moment.
FABIENNE
Forget it.
She exits frame, going back in the bathroom. WE STAY on the WIDE SHOT of the unconscious Butch in bed.
FADE TO BLACK
FADE UP:
MOTEL ROOM – MORNING
SAME SHOT AS BEFORE, the next morning. We find Butch still asleep in bed.
Fabienne brushes her teeth half in and half out of the bathroom so she can watch TV at the same time. She still wears the terry cloth robe from the night before.
ON TV: WILLIAM SMITH and a BUNCH OF HELL'S ANGELS are taking on the entire Vietnamese army in the film "THE LOSERS".
Butch wakes from his sleep, as if a scary monster was chasing him.
His start startles Fabienne.
FABIENNE
Merde! You startled me. Did you have a bad dream?
Butch squints down the front of the bed at her, trying to focus.
Butch, still trying to chase the cobwebs away, sees on TV Hell's Angels tear-assin' through a Vietnamese prison camp.
BUTCH
What are you watching?
FABIENNE
A motorcycle movie, I'm not sure the name.
BUTCH
Are you watchin' it?
Fabienne enters the room.
FABIENNE
In a way. Why? Would you like for me to
switch it off?
BUTCH
Would you please?
She reaches over and turns off the TV.
BUTCH
It's a little too early in the morning for explosions and war.
FABIENNE
What was it about?
BUTCH
How should I know, you were the one
watchin' it.
Fabienne laughs.
FABIENNE
No, imbecile, what was your dream about?
BUTCH
Oh, I...  don't remember. It's really rare
I remember a dream.
FABIENNE
You just woke up from it.
BUTCH
Fabienne, I'm not lying to you, I don't
remember.
FABIENNE
Well, let's look at the grumpy man in the morning. I didn't say you were lying, it's just odd you don't remember your dreams. I always remember mine. Did you know you talk in your sleep?
BUTCH
I don't talk in my sleep, do I talk in my sleep?
FABIENNE
You did last night.
BUTCH
What did I say?
Laying on top of him.
FABIENNE
I don't know. I couldn't understand you.
She kisses Butch.
FABIENNE
Why don't you get up and we'll get some breakfast at that breakfast place with the pancakes.
BUTCH
One more kiss and I'll get up.
Fabienne gives Butch a sweet long kiss.
FABIENNE
Satisfied?
BUTCH
Yep.
FABIENNE
Then get up, lazy bones.
Butch climbs out of bed and starts pulling clothes out of the suitcase that Fabienne brought.
BUTCH
What time is it?
FABIENNE
Almost nine in the morning. What time does our train arrive?
BUTCH
Eleven.
FABIENNE
I'm gonna order a big plate of blueberry pancakes with maple syrup, eggs over easy, and five sausages.
BUTCH
(surprised at her potential appetite)
Anything to drink with that?
Butch is finished dressing.
FABIENNE
(referring to his clothes)
Oh yes, that looks nice. To drink, a tall glass or orange juice and a black cup of coffee. After that, I'm going to have a slice of pie.
As he goes through the suitcase.
BUTCH
Pie for breakfast?
FABIENNE
Any time of the day is a good time for
pie. Blueberry pie to go with the
pancakes. And on top, a thin slice of
melted cheese –
BUTCH
– where's my watch?
FABIENNE
It's there.
BUTCH
No, it's not. It's not here.
FABIENNE
Have you looked?
By now, Butch is frantically rummaging through the suitcase.
BUTCH
Yes I've fuckin' looked!!
He's now throwing clothes.
BUTCH
What the fuck do you think I'm doing?! Are you sure you got it?
Fabienne can hardly speak, she's never seen Butch this way.
FABIENNE
Uhhh...  yes...  beside the table drawer –
BUTCH
– on the little kangaroo.
FABIENNE
Yes, it was on your little kangaroo.
BUTCH
Well it's not here!
FABIENNE
(on the verge of tears)
Well it should be!
BUTCH
Oh it most definitely should be here, but it's not. So where is it?
Fabienne is crying and scared.
Butch lowers his voice, which only serves to make him more menacing.
BUTCH
Fabienne, that was my father's fuckin' watch. You know what my father went through to git me that watch?...  I don't wanna get into it right now...  but he went through a lot. Now all this other shit, you coulda set on fire, but I specifically reminded you not to forget my father's watch. Now think, did you get it?
FABIENNE
I believe so... 
BUTCH
You believe so? You either did, or you
didn't, now which one is it?
FABIENNE
Then I did.
BUTCH
Are you sure?
FABIENNE
(shaking)
No.
Butch freaks out, he punches the air.
Fabienne SCREAMS and backs into a corner,
Butch picks up the motel TV and THROWS IT AGAINST the wall.
Fabienne SCREAMS IN HORROR.
Butch looks toward her, suddenly calm.
BUTCH
(to Fabienne)
No! It's not your fault.
(he approached her)
You left it at the apartment.
He bends down in front of the woman who has sunk to the floor.
He touches her hand, she flinches.
BUTCH
If you did leave it at the apartment, it's not your fault. I had you bring a bunch of stuff. I reminded you about it, but I didn't illustrate how personal the watch was to me. If all I gave a fuck about was my watch, I should've told you. You ain't a mind reader.
He kisses her hand. Then rises.
Fabienne is still sniffling.
Butch goes to the closet.
FABIENNE
I'm sorry.
Butch puts on his high school jacket.
BUTCH
Don't be. It just means I won't be able to eat breakfast with you.
FABIENNE
Why does it mean that?
BUTCH
Because I'm going back to my apartment to get my watch.
FABIENNE
Won't the gangsters be looking for you
there?
BUTCH
That's what I'm gonna find out. If they
are, and I don't think I can handle it,
I'll split.
Rising from the floor.
FABIENNE
I was so dreadful. I saw your watch, I
thought I brought it. I'm so sorry.
Butch brings her close and puts his hands on her face.
BUTCH
Don't feel bad, sugar pop. Nothing you
could ever do would make me permanently
angry at you.
(pause)
I love you, remember?
(he digs some money out of
his wallet)
Now here's some money, order those
pancakes and have a great breakfast.
FABIENNE
Don't go.
BUTCH
I'll be back before you can say, blueberry pie.
FABIENNE
Blueberry pie.
BUTCH
Well maybe not that fast, but fast. Okay?
Okay?
FABIENNE
Okay.
He kisses her once more and heads for the door.
BUTCH
Bye-bye, sugar pop.
FABIENNE
Bye.
BUTCH
I'm gonna take your Honda.
FABIENNE
Okay.
And with that, he's out the door.
Fabienne sits on the bed and looks at the money he gave her.
INT. HONDA (MOVING) – DAY
Butch is beating the steering wheel and the dash with his fists as he drives down the street.
BUTCH
Of all the fuckin' things she coulda forgot, she forgets my father's watch. I specifically reminded her not to forget it. "Bedside table – on the kangaroo." I said the words: "Don't forget my father's watch."
EXT. CITY STREET – DAY
The little Honda races toward its destination as fast as is little engine will take it.
CUT TO:
A parking meter red flag rises up, then out, leaving the arrow pointing at one hour.
EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET CORNER – DAY
Butch isn't completely reckless. He has parked his car a couple of blocks from his apartment to check things out before he goes boppin' through the front door.
EXT. ALLEY – DAY
Butch walks down the alley until he gets to another street, then he discreetly glances out.
EXT. STREET – BUTCH'S APARTMENT – DAY
Everything seems normal. More or less the right number of cars in the street. None of the parked cars appear out of place. None of them have a couple of goons sitting inside. Basically, it looks like normal morning activity in front of Butch's home.
Butch peers around a wall, taking in the vital information.
Butch walks out of the alley and is ready for anything. He crosses the street and enters his apartment courtyard.
Across the street from Butch's building, on the corner, is a combination donut shop and Japanese restaurant. A big sign sticks up in the air, with the name "Teriyaki Donut" and a graphic of a donut sticking out of a bowl of rice.
EXT. BUTCH'S APARTMENT COURTYARD – DAY
Butch is in the courtyard of his North Hollywood apartment building. Once again, everything appears normal – the laundry room, the pool, his apartment door – nothing appears disturbed.
Butch climbs the stairs leading to his apartment, number 12. He steps outside the door and listens inside. Nothing.
Butch slowly inserts the key into the door, quietly opening it.
INT. BUTCH'S APARTMENT – DAY
His apartment hasn't been touched.
He cautiously steps inside, shuts the door and takes a quick look around. Obviously, no one is there.
Butch walks into his modest kitchen, and opens the refrigerator. He takes out a carton of milk and drinks from it.
With carton in hard, Butch surveys the apartment. Then he goes to the bedroom.
His bedroom is like the rest of the apartment – neat, clean and anonymous. The only things personal in his room are a few boxing trophies, an Olympic silver medal, a framed issue of "Ring Magazine" with Butch on the cover, and a poster of Jerry Quarry and one of George Chuvalo.
Sure enough, there's the watch just like he said it was: On the bedside table, hanging on his little kangaroo statue.
He walks through the apartment and back into the kitchen. He opens a cupboard and takes out a box of Pop Tarts. Putting down the milk, he opens the box, takes out two Pop Tarts and puts them in the toaster.
Butch glances to his right, his eyes fall on something.
What he sees is a small compact Czech M61 submachine gun with a huge silencer on it, lying on his kitchen counter.
BUTCH
(softly)
Holy shit.
He picks up the intimidating peace of weaponary and examines it.
Then...  a toilet FLUSHES.
Butch looks up to the bathroom door, which is parallel to the kitchen. There is someone behind it.
Like a rabbit caught in a radish patch, Butch freezes, not knowing what to do.
The bathroom door opens and Vincent Vega steps out of the bathroom, tightening his belt. In his hand is the book "MODESTY BLAISE" by Peter O'Donnell.
Vincent and Butch lock eyes.
Vincent freezes.
Butch doesn't move, except to point the M61 in Vincent's direction.
Neither man opens his mouth.
Then...  the toaster LOUDLY kicks up the Pop Tarts.
That's all the situation needed.
Butch's finger HITS the trigger.
MUFFLED FIRE SHOOTS out of the end of the gun.
Vincent is seemingly WRACKED with twenty bullets SIMULTANEOUSLY – LIFTING him off his feet, PROPELLING him through the air and CRASHING through the glass shower door at the end of the bathroom.
By the time Butch removes his finger from the trigger, Vincent is annihilated.
Butch stands frozen, amazed at what just happened. His look goes from the grease spot in the bathroom that was once Vincent, down to the powerful piece of artillery in his grip.
With the respect it deserves, Butch carefully places the M61 back on the kitchen counter.
Then he exits the apartment, quickly.
EXT. APARTMENT COURTYARD – DAY
Butch, not running, but walking very rapidly, crosses the courtyard... 
...  comes out of the apartment building, crosses the street... 
...  goes through the alley... 
...  and into his car in one STEADICAM SHOT.
EXT. HONDA – DAY
Butch CRANKS the car into gear and drives away. The big wide smile of a survivor breaks across his face.
EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING STREET – DAY
The Honda turns down the alley and slowly cruises by his apartment building.
INT. HONDA – DAY
Butch looks out the window at his former home.
BUTCH
That's how you're gonna beat 'em, Butch.
They keep underestimatin' ya.
This makes the boxer laugh out loud. As he laughs, he flips a tape in the cassette player. When the MUSIC starts, he SINGS along with it.
He drives by the apartment, but is stopped at the light on the corner across from Teriyaki Donut.
Butch is still chuckling, singing along with the song, as we see:
THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD
The big man himself, Marsellus Wallace, exit Teriyaki Donut, carrying a box of a dozen donuts and two large styrofoam cups of coffee. He steps off the curb, crossing the street in front of Butch's car. This is the first time we see Marsellus clearly.
Laughing boy stops when he sees the big man directly in front of him.
When Marsellus is in front of Butch's car, he casually glances to his left, sees Butch, continues walking...  then STOPS!
DOUBLE-TAKE: "Am I really seeing what I'm seeing?"
Butch doesn't wait for the big man to answer his own question. He STOMPS on the gas pedal.
The little Honda SLAMS into Marsellus, sending him, the donuts and the coffee HITTING the pavement at thirty miles an hour.
Butch CUTS into cross traffic and is BROAD-SIDED by a gold Camaro Z-28, BREAKING all the windows in the Honda and sending it up on the sidewalk.
Butch sits dazed and confused in the crumpled mess of what at one time was Fabienne's Honda. Blood flows from his nostrils. The still-functional tape player continues to play. A PEDESTRIAN pokes his head inside.
PEDESTRIAN
Jesus, are you okay?
Butch look at him, spaced-out.
BUTCH
I guess.
Marsellus Wallace lies sprawled out in the street. GAWKERS gather around the body.
GAWKER #1
(to the others)
He's dead! He's dead!
This jerk's yelling makes Marsellus come to.
TWO PEDESTRIANS help the shaken Butch out of the wreckage.
The woozy Marsellus gets to his feet.
GAWKER #2
If you need a witness in court, I'll be glad to help. He was a drunken maniac. He hit you and crashed into that car.
MARSELLUS
(still incoherent)
Who?
GAWKER #2
(pointing at Butch)
Him.
Marsellus follows the Gawker's finger and sees Butch Coolidge down the street, looking a shambles.
MARSELLUS
Well, I'll be damned.
The big man takes out a .45 Automatic and the Gawkers back away.
Marsellus starts moving toward Butch.
Butch sees the fierce figure making a wobbly bee-line toward him.
BUTCH
Sacre bleu.
Marsellus brings up his weapon and FIRES, but he's so hurt, shaky and dazed that his arm goes wild.
He HITS a LOOKY-LOO WOMAN in the hip. She falls to the ground, screaming.
LOOKY-LOO WOMAN
Oh my God, I've been shot!
That's all Butch needs to see. He's outta here.
Marsellus RUNS after him.
The CROWD looks agape.
Butch is in a mad, limping RUN.
The big man's hot on his ass with a cockeyed wobbly run.
Butch cuts across traffic and dashes into a business with a sign that reads "MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP".
INT. MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP – DAY
MAYNARD, a hillbilly-lookin' boy, stands behind the counter of his pawnshop when, all of a sudden, chaos in the form of Butch RACES into his world.
MAYNARD
Can I help you wit' somethin'?
BUTCH
Shut up!
Butch quickly takes measure of the situation, than stands next to the door.
MAYNARD
Now you just wait one goddamn minute –
Before Maynard can finish his threat, Marsellus CHARGES in. He doesn't get past the doorway because Butch LANDS his fist in Marsellus' face.
The gangster's feet go out from under him and the big man FALLS FLAT on his back.
Outside, two police cars with their SIRENS BLARING race by.
Butch POUNCES on the fallen body, PUNCHING him twice more in the face.
Butch takes the gun out of Marsellus' hand, than grabs ahold of his middle finger.
BUTCH
So you like chasing people, huh?
He BREAKS the finger. Marsellus lets out a pain sound.Butch then places the barrel of the .45 between his eyes, PULLS back the hammer and places his open hand behind the gun to shield the splatter.
BUTCH
Well guess what, big man, you caught me –
MAYNARD (O.S.)
– hold it right there, godammit!
Butch and Marsellus look up at Maynard, who's brandishing a pump-action shotgun, aimed at the two men.
BUTCH
Look mister, this ain't any of your
business –
MAYNARD
– I'm makin' it my business! Now toss that gun!
Butch does.
MAYNARD
Now you on top, stand up and come to the counter.
Butch slowly gets up and moves to the counter. As soon as he gets there, Maynard HAULS OFF, HITTING him hard in the face with the butt of the shotgun, knocking Butch down and out.
After Butch goes down, Maynard calmly lays the shotgun on the counter and moves to the telephone.
Marsellus Wallace, from his position on the floor, groggily watches the pawnshop owner dial a number. Maynard waits on the line while the other end rings. Then it picks up.
MAYNARD
Zed? It's Maynard. The spider just caught a coupl'a flies.
Marsellus passes out.
FADE TO BLACK
FADE UP:
INT. PAWNSHOP BACK ROOM – DAY
TWO SHOT – BUTCH AND MARSELLUS
They are tied up in two separate chairs. In their mouths are two S&M-style ball gags (a belt goes around their heads and a little red ball sticks in their mouths). Both men are unconscious.
Maynard steps in with a fire extinguisher and SPRAYS both guys until they're wide awake and wet as otters. The two prisoners look up at their captors.
Maynard stands in front of them, fire extinguisher in one hand, shotgun in the other, and Marsellus' .45 sticking in his belt.
MAYNARD
Nobody kills anybody in my place of
business except me or Zed.
A BUZZER buzzes.
MAYNARD
That's Zed.
Without saying another word, Maynard climbs up the stairs that lead to red curtains and goes through them.
WE HEAR, on the other side of the curtains, Maynard let Zed inside the store.
Butch and Marsellus look around the room. The basement of the pawnshop has been converted into a dungeon. After taking in their predicament, Butxh and Marsellus look at each other, all traces of hostility gone, replaced by a terror they both share at what they've gotten themselves into.
Maynard and ZED come through the curtains. Zed is an even more intense version of Maynard, if such a thing is possible. The two hillbillys are obviously brothers. Where Maynard is a vicious pitbull, Zed is a deadly cobra. Zed walks in and stands in front of the two captives. He inspects them for a long time, then says:
ZED
(to Maynard)
You said you waited for me?
MAYNARD
I did.
ZED
Then how come they're all beat up?
MAYNARD
They did that to each other. They was fightin' when they came in. This one was gonna shoot that one.
ZED
(to Butch)
You were gonna shoot him?
Butch makes no reply.
ZED
Hey, is Grace gonna be okay in front of
this place?
MAYNARD
Yeah, it ain't Tuesday is it?
ZED
No, it's Thursday.
MAYNARD
Then she'll be fine.
ZED
Bring out The Gimp.
MAYNARD
I think The Gimp's sleepin'.
ZED
Well, I guess you'll just wake 'em up
then, won't you?
Maynard opens a trap door in the floor.
MAYNARD
(yelling in the hole)
Wake up!
Maynard reaches into the hole and comes back holding onto a leash. He gives it a rough yank and, from below the floor, rises THE GIMP.
The Gimp is a man they keep dressed from head to toe in black leather bondage gear. There are zippers, buckles and studs here and there on the body. On his head is a black leather mask with two eye holes and a zipper (closed) for a mouth. They keep him in a hole in the floor big enough for a large dog.
Zed takes the chair, sits it in front of the two prisoners, then lowers into it. Maynard hands The Gimp's leash to Zed, then backs away.
MAYNARD
(to The Gimp)
Down!
The Gimp gets on its knees.
Maynard hangs back while Zed appraises the two men.
MAYNARD
Who's first?
ZED
I ain't fer sure yet.
Then with his little finger, Zed does a silent "Eenie, meany, miney, moe...  " just his mouth mouthing the words and his finger going back and forth between the two.
Butch are Marsellus are terrified.
Maynard looks back and forth at the victims.
The Gimps's eyes go from one to the other inside the mask.
Zed continues his silent sing-song with his finger moving left to right, then it stops.
TWO SHOT – BUTCH AND MARSELLUS
After a beat, THE CAMERA MOVES to the right, zeroing in on Marsellus.
Zed stands up.
ZED
Wanna do it here?
MAYNARD
Naw, drag big boy to Russell's old room.
Zed grabs Marsellus' chair and DRAGS him into Russell's old room. Russell, no doubt, was some other poor bastard that has the misfortune of stumbling into the Mason-Dixie pawnshop. Whatever happened to Russell is known only to Maynard and Zed because his old room, a back room in the back of the back room, is empty.
As Marsellus is dragged away, he locks eyes with Butch before he disappears behind the door of Russell's old room.
MAYNARD
(to The Gimp)
Up!
The Gimp rises. Maynard ties The Gimp's leash to a hook on the ceiling.
MAYNARD
Keep an eye on this one.
The Gimp bows its head: "yes."Maynard disappears into Russell's old room. There must be a stereo in there because suddenly The Judds, singing in harmony, fills the air.
Butch looks at The Gimp. The Gimp giggles from underneath the mask as if this were the funniest moment in the history of comedy.
From behind the door we hear country MUSIC, struggling, and:
MAYNARD (O.S.)
Whoa, this boy's got a bit of fight in
'em!
We the HEAR Maynard and Zed beat on Marsellus.
ZED (O.S.)
You wanna fight? You wanna fight? Good, I like to fight!
Butch pauses, listens to the voices. Then, in a panic, hurriedly struggles to get free.
The Gimp is laughing wildly.
The ropes are on too tight and Butch can't break free.
The Gimp slaps his knee laughing
In the back room, we hear:
MAYNARD (O.S.)
That's it...  that's it boy, you're goin' fine. Oooooooh, just like that...  that's good.
(grunting faster)
Stay still...  stay still goddamn ya! Zed goddammit, git over here and hold 'em!
Butch stops struggling and lifts up on his arms. Then, quite easily, the padded chair back slides up and off as if it were never connected by a bolt.
The Gimp sees this and its eyes widen.
THE GIMP
Huhng?
The Gimp FLAILS WILDLY, trying to get the leash off the hook. He tries to yell, but all that comes out are excited gurgles and grunts.
Butch is out of his chair, quickly dispensing three BOXER'S PUNCHES to its face. The punches knock The Gimp out, making him fall to his knees, this HANGING HIMSELF by the leash attached to the hook,
Butch removes the ball gag, then silently makes his way through the red curtains.
INT. PAWNSHOP – DAY
Butch sneaks to the door.
On the counter is a big set of keys with a large Z connected to the ring. Grabbing them, he's about to go out when he stops and listens to the hillbilly psychopaths having their way with Marsellus.
Butch decides for the life of him, he can't leave anybody in a situation like that. Se he begins rooting around the pawnshop for a weapon to bash those hillbillies' heads in with.
He picks up a big destructive-looking hammer, then discards it: Not destructive enough. He picks up a chainsaw, thinks about it for a moment, then puts it back. Next, a large Louisville slugger he tries on for size. But then he spots what he's been looking for:
A Samurai sword.
It hands in its hand-carved wood sheath from a nail on the wall, next to a neon "DAD'S OLD-FASHIONED ROOT BEER" sign. Butch takes the sword off the wall, removing it from ist sheath. It's a magnificent piece of steel. It seems to glisten in the low-wattage light of the pawnshop. Butch touches his thumb to the blade to see if the sword is just for show. Not on your life. It's as sharp as it gets. This weapon seems made to order for the Brothers Grimm downstairs. Holding the sword pointed downward, Takakura Ken-style, he disappears through the red curtains to take care of business.
INT. PAWNSHOP BACK ROOM – DAY
Butch quietly sneaks down the stairs leading to the dungeon. Sodomy and the Judds can still be heard going string behind the closed door that leads to Russell's old room.
INT. RUSSELL'S OLD ROOM – DAY
Butch's hand comes into frame, pushing the door open. It swings open silently, revealing the rapists, who have switched positions. Zed is now bent over Marsellus, who is bent over a wooden horse. Maynard watches. Both have their backs to Butch.
Maynard faces the CAMERA, grinning, while Butch comes up behind him with the sword.
Miserable, violated, and looking like a rag doll, Marsellus, red ball gag still in mouth, opens his watery eyes to see Butch coming up behind Maynard. His eyes widen.
BUTCH
Hey hillbilly.
Maynard turns and sees Butch holding the sword.
Butch SCREAMS...  with one mighty SWING, SLASHES Maynard across the front, moving past him, eyes and blade now locked on Zed.
Maynard stands trembling, his front sliced open, in shock.
Butch, while never taking his eyes off Zed, THRUSTS the sword behind him, SKEWERING Maynard, then EXTRACTS it, pointing the blade toward Zed. Maynard COLLAPSES.
Zed disengages from Marsellus in a hurry and his eyes go from the tip of Butch's sword to Marsellus' .45 Automatic, which lies within reach.
Butch's eyes follow Zed's.
