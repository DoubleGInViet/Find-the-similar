BUTCH
You want that gun, Zed? Pick it up.
Zed's hand inches toward the weapon.
Butch GRIPS the sword tighter.
Zed studies Butch.
Butch looks hard at Zed.
Then a VOICE says:
MARSELLUS (O.S.)
Step aside, Butch.
Butch steps aside, REVEALING Marsellus standing behind him, holding Maynard's pump-action shotgun.
KABOOM!!!!
Zed is BLASTED in the groin. Down he goes, SCREAMING in AGONY.
Marsellus, looking down at his whimpering rapist, EJECTS the used shotgun shell.
Butch lowers the sword and hangs back. Not a word, until:
BUTCH
You okay?
MARSELLUS
Naw man. I'm pretty fuckin' far from okay!
Long pause.
BUTCH
What now?
MARSELLUS
What now? Well let me tell you what now. I'm gonna call a couple pipe-hittin' niggers, who'll go to work on homes here with a pair of pliers and a blow torch.
(to Zed)
Hear me talkin' hillbilly boy?! I ain't
through with you by a damn sight. I'm
gonna git Medieval on your ass.
BUTCH
I meant what now, between me and you?
MARSELLUS
Oh, that what now? Well, let me tell ya what now between me an' you. There is no me an' you. Not no more.
BUTCH
So we're cool?
MARSELLUS
Yeah man, we're cool. One thing I ask – two things I ask: Don't tell nobody about this. This shit's between me and you and the soon-to-be-livin'-the-rest-of-his-short-ass-life-in-agonizing-pain, Mr. Rapist here. It ain't nobody else's business. Two: leave town. Tonight. Right now. And when you're gone, stay gone. You've lost your Los Angeles privileges. Deal?
BUTCH
Deal.
The two men shake hands, then hug one another.
MARSELLUS
Go on now, get your ass outta here.
Butch leaves Russell's old room through the red curtains.
Marsellus walks over to a phone, dialing a number.
MARSELLUS
(into the phone)
Hello Mr. Wolf, it's Marsellus. Gotta bit of a situation.
EXT. MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP – DAY
Butch, still shaking in his boots, exits the pawnshop. He looks ahead and sees, parked in front of the establishment, Zed's Big Chrome Chopper with a teardrop gas tank that has the name "GRACE" on it. He climbs aboard, takes out the keys with the big Z on them and starts up the huge hog. It RUMBLES to life, making sounds like a rocket fighting for orbit. Butch twists the accelerator handle and SPEEDS off.
WE CUT BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN... 
INT. BUTCH AND FABIENNE'S HOTEL ROOM – DAY
Fabienne stands in front of a mirror wearing a "Frankie says, Relax" tee-shirt, singing along with MUSIC coming from a BOOM BOX.
EXT. CITY STREET – CHOPPER (MOVING) – DAY
Butch drives down the street, humping a hot dog named "GRACE." He checks his father's watch. It says: 10:30.
The SONG in the motel room PLAYS OVER this.
EXT. MOTEL ROOM – DAY
Butch rides up on Grace. He hops off and runs inside the motel room, while we stay outside with the bike.
FABIENNE (O.S.)
Butch, I was so worried!
BUTCH
Honey, grab your radio and your purse and let's go!
FABIENNE (O.S.)
But what about all our bags?
BUTCH
Fuck the bags. We'll miss our train if we don't split now.
FABIENNE (O.S.)
Is everything well? Are we in danger?
BUTCH
We're cool. In fact, we're super-cool. But we gots to go. I'll wait for you outside.
Butch runs out and hops back on the bike. Fabienne exits the motel room with the boom box and a large purse. When she sees Butch on the chopper, she stops dead.
FABIENNE
Where did you get this motorcycle?
BUTCH
(he kick-starts it)
It's a chopper, baby, hop on.
Fabienne slowly approaches the two-wheel demon.
FABIENNE
What happened to my Honda?
BUTCH
Sorry baby, I crashed the Honda.
FABIENNE
You're hurt?
BUTCH
I might've broke my nose, no biggie. Hop on.
She doesn't move.
Butch looks at her.
BUTCH
Honey, we gotta hit the fuckin' road!
Fabienne starts to cry.
Butch realizes that this is not the way to get her on the bike. He turns off the engine and reaches out, taking her hand.
BUTCH
I'm sorry, baby-love.
FABIENNE
(crying)
You were gone so long, I started to think dreadful thoughts.
BUTCH
I'm sorry I worried you, sweetie.
Everything's fine. Hey, how was breakfast?
FABIENNE
(waterworks drying a little)
It was good –
BUTCH
– did you get the blueberry pancakes?
FABIENNE
No, they didn't have blueberry pancakes, I had to get buttermilk – are you sure you're okay?
BUTCH
Baby-love, from the moment I left you,
this has been without a doubt the single
weirdest day of my entire life. Climb on
an' I'll tell ya about it.
Fabienne does climb on. Butch STARTS her up.
FABIENNE
Butch, whose motorcycle is this?
BUTCH
It's a chopper.
FABIENNE
Whose chopper is this?
BUTCH
Zed's.
FABIENNE
Who's Zed?
BUTCH
Zed's dead, baby, Zed's dead.
And with that, the two lovebirds PEEL AWAY on Grace, as the SONG on the BOOM BOX RISES.
FADE TO BLACK
TITLE CARD:
"JULES VINCENTJIMMIE &THE WOLF"
TITLE DISAPPEARS.
Over black, we can HEAR in the distance, men talking.
JULES (O.S.)
You ever read the Bible, Brett?
BRETT (O.S.)
Yes!
JULES (O.S.)
There's a passage I got memorized, seems appropriate for this situation: Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men... "
FADE UP:
INT. BATHROOM – DAY
We're in the bathroom of the Hollywood apartment we were in earlier. In fact, we're there at exactly the same time. Except this time, we're in the bathroom with the FOURTH MAN. The Fourth Man is pacing around the small room, listening hard to what's being said on the other side of the door, tightly CLUTCHING his huge silver .357 Magnum.
JULES (O.S.)
"...  blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shephered the weak through the valley of darkness. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know I am the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon you."
BANG! BANG! BOOM! POW! BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM!
The Fourth Man freaks out. He THROWS himself against the back wall, gun outstretched in front of him, a look of yellow fear on his face, ready to blow in half anybody fool enough to stick their head through that door.
Then he listens to them talk.
VINCENT (O.S.)
Friend of yours?
JULES (O.S.)
Yeah, Marvin-Vincent-Vincent-Marvin.
Waiting for them isn't the smartest move. Bursting out the door and blowing them all away while they're fuckin' around is the way to go.
INT. APARTMENT – DAY
The bathroom door BURSTS OPEN and the Fourth Man CHARGES out, silver Magnum raised, FIRING SIX BOOMING SHOTS from his hand cannon.
FOURTH MAN
Die...  die...  die...  die... !
DOLLY INTO Fourth Man, same as before.
He SCREAM until he's dry firing. Then a look of confusion crosses his face.
TWO SHOT – JULES AND VINCENT
Standing next to each other, unharmed. Amazing as it seems, none of the Fourth Man's shots appear to have hit anybody. Jules and Vincent exchange looks like, "Are we hit?" They're as confused at the shooter. After looking at each other, they bring their looks up to the Fourth Man.
FOURTH MAN
I don't understand –
The Fourth Man is taken out of the scenario by the two men's bullets who, unlike his, HIT their marks. He drops DEAD.
The two men lower their guns. Jules, obviously shaken, sits down in a chair. Vincent, after a moment of respect, shrugs it off. Then heads toward Marvin in the corner.
VINCENT
Why the fuck didn't you tell us about that guy in the bathroom? Slip your mind? Forget he was in there with a goddamn hand cannon?
JULES
(to himself)
We should be fuckin' dead right now.
(pause)
Did you see that gun he fired at us? It
was bigger than him.
VINCENT
.357.
JULES
We should be fuckin' dead!
VINCENT
Yeah, we were lucky.
Jules rises, moving toward Vincent.
JULES
That shit wasn't luck. That shit was
somethin' else.
Vincent prepares to leave.
VINCENT
Yeah, maybe.
JULES
That was...  divine intervention. You know what divine intervention is?
VINCENT
Yeah, I think so. That means God came down from Heaven and stopped the bullets.
JULES
Yeah, man, that's what is means. That's exactly what it means! God came down from Heaven and stopped the bullets.
VINCENT
I think we should be going now.
JULES
Don't do that! Don't you fuckin' do that! Don't blow this shit off! What just happened was a fuckin' miracle!
VINCENT
Chill the fuck out, Jules, this shit
happens.
JULES
Wrong, wrong, this shit doesn't just
happen.
VINCENT
Do you wanna continue this theological discussion in the car, or at the jailhouse with the cops?
JULES
We should be fuckin' dead now, my friend! We just witnessed a miracle, and I want you to fuckin' acknowledge it!
VINCENT
Okay man, it was a miracle, can we leave now?
EXT. HOLLYWOOD APARTMENT BUILDING – MORNING
The Chevy Nova PROPELS itself into traffic.
INT. NOVA (MOVING) – MORNING
Jules is behind the wheel,Vincent in the passenger seat and Marvin in the back.
VINCENT
...  Ever seen that show "COPS?"I was watchin' it once and this cop was on it who was talkin' about this time he got into this gun fight with a guy in a hallway. He unloads on this guy and he doesn't hit anything. And these guys were in a hallway. It's a freak, but it happens.
JULES
If you wanna play blind man, then go walk with a Shepherd. But me, my eyes are wide fuckin' open.
VINCENT
What the fuck does that mean?
JULES
That's it for me. For here on in, you can consider my ass retired.
VINCENT
Jesus Christ!
JULES
Don't blaspheme!
VINCENT
Goddammit, Jules –
JULES
– I said don't do that –
VINCENT
– you're fuckin' freakin' out!
JULES
I'm tellin' Marsellus today I'm through.
VINCENT
While you're at it, be sure to tell 'im
why.
JULES
Don't worry, I will.
VINCENT
I'll bet ya ten thousand dollars, he
laughs his ass off.
JULES
I don't give a damn if he does.
Vincent turns to the backseat with the .45 casually in his grip.
VINCENT
Marvin, what do you make of all this?
MARVIN
I don't even have an opinion.
VINCENT
C'mon, Marvin. Do you think God came down from Heaven and stopped the bullets?
Vincent's .45 goes BANG!
Marvin is hit in the upper chest, below the throat. He GURGLES blood and SHAKES.
JULES
What the fuck's happening?
VINCENT
I just accidentally shot Marvin in the
throat.
JULES
Why the fuck did you do that?
VINCENT
I didn't mean to do it. I said it was an accident.
JULES
I've seen a lot of crazy-ass shit in my
time –
VINCENT
– chill out, man, it was an accident, okay? You hit a bump or somethin' and the gun went off.
JULES
The car didn't hit no motherfuckin' bump!
VINCENT
Look! I didn't mean to shoot this son-of-a-bitch, the gun just went off, don't ask me how!
JULES
Look at this mess! We're drivin' around on a city street in broad daylight –
VINCENT
– I know, I know, I wasn't thinkin' about the splatter.
JULES
Well you better be thinkin' about it now, motherfucker! We gotta get this car off the road. Cops tend to notice shit like you're driving a car drenched in fuckin' blood.
VINCENT
Can't we just take it to a friendly place?
JULES
This is the Valley,Vincent. Marsellus
don't got no friendly places in the
Valley.
VINCENT
Well, don't look at me, this is your town,
Jules.
Jules takes out a cellular phone and starts punching digits.
VINCENT
Who ya callin'?
JULES
A buddy of mine in Toluca Lake.
VINCENT
Where's Toluca Lake.
JULES
On the other side of the hill, by Burbank Studios. If Jimmie's ass ain't home, I don't know what the fuck we're gonna go. I ain't got any other partners in 818.
(into phone)
Jimmie! How you doin' man, it's Jules.
(pause)
Listen up man, me an' my homeboy are in some serious shit. We're in a car we gotta get off the road, pronto! I need to use your garage for a couple hours.
INT. JIMMIE'S BATHROOM – DAY
Jules is bent over a sink, washing his bloody hands while Vincent stands behind him.
JULES
We gotta be real fuckin' delicate with this Jimmie's situation. He's one remark away from kickin' our asses out the door.
VINCENT
If he kicks us out, whadda we do?
JULES
Well, we ain't leavin' 'til we made a couple phone calls. But I never want it to reach that pitch. Jimmie's my friend and you don't bust in your friend's house and start tellin' 'im what's what.
Jules rises and dries his hands. Vincent takes his place at the sink.
VINCENT
Just tell 'im not to be abusive. He kinda freaked out back there when he saw Marvin.
JULES
Put yourself in his position. It's eight o'clock in the morning. He just woke up, he wasn't prepared for this shit. Don't forget who's doin' who a favor.
Vincent finishes, then dries his hands on a white towel.
VINCENT
If the price of that favor is I gotta take shit, he can stick his favor straight up his ass.
When Vincent is finished drying his hands, the towel is stained with red.
JULES
What the fuck did you just do to his
towel?
VINCENT
I was just dryin' my hands.
JULES
You're supposed to wash 'em first.
VINCENT
You watched me wash 'em.
JULES
I watched you get 'em wet.
VINCENT
I washed 'em. Blood's real hard to get off. Maybe if he had some Lava, I coulda done a better job.
JULES
I used the same soap you did and when I dried my hands, the towel didn't look like a fuckin' Maxie pad. Look, fuck it, alright. Who cares? But it's shit like this that's gonna bring this situation to a boil. If he were to come in here and see that towel like that...  I'm tellin' you Vincent, you best be cool. 'Cause if I gotta get in to it with Jimmie on account of you...  Look, I ain't threatenin' you, I respect you an' all, just don't put me in that position.
JULES
Jules, you ask me nice like that, no problem. He's your friend, you handle him.
INT. JIMMIE'S KITCHEN – MORNING
Three men are standing in Jimmie's kitchen, each with a mug of coffee. Jules, Vincent and JIMMIE DIMMICK, a young man in his late 20s dressed in a bathrobe.
JULES
Goddamn Jimmie, this is some serious gourmet shit. Me an' Vincent woulda been satisfied with freeze-dried Tasters Choice. You spring this gourmet fuckin' shit on us. What flavor is this?
JIMMIE
Knock it off, Julie.
JULES
What?
JIMMIE
I'm not a cobb or corn, so you can stop butterin' me up. I don't need you to tell me how good my coffee is. I'm the one who buys it, I know how fuckin' good it is. When Bonnie goes shoppin;, she buys shit. I buy the gourmet expensive stuff 'cause when I drink it, I wanna taste it. But what's on my mind at this moment isn't the coffee in my kitchen, it's the dead nigger in my garage.
JULES
Jimmie –
JIMMIE
– I'm talkin'. Now let me ask you a question, Jules. When you drove in here, did you notice a sign out front that said, "Dead nigger storage?"
Jules starts to "Jimmie" him –
JIMMIE
– answer to question. Did you see a sign out in front of my house that said, "Dead nigger storage?"
JULES
(playing along)
Naw man, I didn't.
JIMMIE
You know why you didn't see that sign?
JULES
Why?
JIMMIE
'Cause storin' dead niggers ain't my
fuckin' business!
Jules starts to "Jimmie" him.
JIMMIE
– I ain't through! Now don't you understand that if Bonnie comes home and finds a dead body in her house, I'm gonna get divorced. No marriage counselor, no trial separation – fuckin' divorced. And I don't wanna get fuckin' divorced. The last time me an' Bonnie talked about this shit was gonna be the last time me an' Bonnie talked about this shit. Now I wanna help ya out Julie, I really do. But I ain't gonna lose my wife doin' it.
JULES
Jimmie –
JIMMIE
– don't fuckin' Jimmie me, man, I can't be Jimmied. There's nothin' you can say that's gonna make me forget I love my wife. Now she's workin' the graveyard shift at the hospital. She'll be comin' home in less than an hour and a half. Make your phone calls, talk to your people, than get the fuck out of my house.
JULES
That's all we want. We don't wanna fuck up your shit,We just need to call our people to bring us in.
JIMMIE
Then I suggest you get to it. Phone's in my bedroom.
INT. MARSELLUS WALLACE'S DINING ROOM – MORNING
Marsellus Wallace sits at his dining table in a big comfy robe, eating his large breakfast, while talking on the phone.
MARSELLUS
...  well, say she comes home. Whaddya
think she'll do?
(pause)
No fuckin' shit she'll freak. That ain't no kinda answer. You know 'er, I don't. How bad, a lot or a little?
INT. JIMMIE'S BEDROOM – MORNING
Jules paces around in Jimmie's bedroom on the phone.
JULES
You got to appreciate what an explosive element this Bonnie situation is. If she comes home from a hard day's work and finds a bunch of gangsters doin' a bunch of gangsta' shit in her kitchen, ain't no tellin' what she's apt to do.
MARSELLUS
I've grasped that, Jules. All I'm doin' is contemplating the "ifs."
JULES
I don't wanna hear about no motherfuckin' "ifs."What I wanna hear from your ass is: "you ain't got no problems, Jules. I'm on the motherfucker. Go back in there, chill them niggers out and wait for the cavalry, which should be comin' directly."
MARSELLUS
You ain't got no problems, Jules. I'm on the motherfucker. Go back in there, chill them niggers out and wait for The Wolf, who should be comin' directly.
JULES
You sendin' The Wolf?
MARSELLUS
Feel better?
JULES
Shit Negro, that's all you had to say.
INT. HOTEL SUITE – MORNING
The CAMERA looks through the bedroom doorway of a hotel suite into
the main area. We SEE a crap game being played on a fancy crap
table by GAMBLERS in tuxedos and LUCKY LADIES in fancy evening
gowns. The CAMERA PANS to the right revealing: Sitting on a bed,
phone in hand with his back to us, the tuxedo-clad WINSTON WOLF
aka "THE WOLF". We also see The Wolf has a small notepad that he
jots details
in.
THE WOLF
(into phone)
Is she the hysterical type?
(pause)
When she due?
(jotting down)
Give me the principals' names again?
(jots down)
Jules... 
We SEE his book. The page has written on it:
"1265 Riverside Drive
Toluca Lake
1 body (no head)
Bloody shot-up car
Jules (black)"
THE WOLF
...  Vincent...  Jimmie...  Bonnie... 
He writes:
"Vincent (Dean Martin)
Jimmie (house)
Bonnie (9:30)"
THE WOLF
Expect a call around 10:30. It's about thirty minutes away. I'll be there in ten.
He hangs up. We never see his face.
CUT TO:
TITLE CARD OVER BLACK:
"NINE MINUTES AND THIRTY-SEVEN SECONDS LATER"
CUT TO:
EXT. JIMMIE'S STREET – MORNING
A silver Porsche WHIPS the corner leading to Jimmie's home, in HYPER DRIVE. Easily doing 135 mph, the Porsche stops on a dime in front of Jimmie's house.
A ringed finger touches the doorbell: DING DONG.
INT. JIMMIE'S HOUSE – MORNING
Jimmie opens the door. We see, standing in the doorway, the tuxedo-clad man. He looks down to his notebook, then up at Jimmie.
THE WOLF
You're Jimmie, right? This is your house?
JIMMIE
Yeah.
THE WOLF
(stick his hand out)
I'm Winston Wolf, I solve problems.
JIMMIE
Good, 'cause we got one.
THE WOLF
So I heard. May I come in?
JIMMIE
Please do.
In the dining room, Jules and Vincent stand up.
THE WOLF
You must be Jules, which would make you
Vincent. Let's get down to brass tacks,
gentlemen. If I was informed correctly,
the clock is ticking, is that right,
Jimmie?
JIMMIE
100%.
THE WOLF
Your wife, Bonnie... 
(refers to his pad)
...  comes home at 9:30 in the AM, is that correct?
JIMMIE
Uh-huh.
THE WOLF
I was led to believe if she comes home and finds us here, she wouldn't appreciate it none too much.
JIMMIE
She won't at that.
THE WOLF
That give use forty minutes to get the fuck outta Dodge, which, if you do what I say when I say it, should by plenty. Now you got a corpse in a car, minus a head, in a garage. Take me to it.
INT. JIMMIE'S GARAGE – MORNING
The three men hand back as The Wolf examines the car. He studies the car in silence, opening the door, looking inside, circling it.
THE WOLF
Jimmie?
JIMMIE
Yes.
THE WOLF
Do me a favor, will ya? Thought I smelled some coffee in there. Would you make me a cup?
JIMMIE
Sure, how do you take it?
THE WOLF
Lotsa cream, lotsa sugar.
Jimmie exists. The Wolf continues his examination.
THE WOLF
About the car, is there anything I need to know? Does it stall, does it make a lot of noise, does it smoke, is there gas in it, anything?
JULES
Aside from how it looks, the car's cool.
THE WOLF
Positive? Don't get me out on the road and
I find out the brake lights don't work.
JULES
Hey man, as far as I know, the
motherfucker's tip-top.
THE WOLF
Good enough, let's go back to the kitchen.
INT. KITCHEN – MORNING
Jimmie hands The Wolf a cup of coffee.
THE WOLF
Thank you, Jimmie.
He takes a sip, then, pacing as he thinks, lays out for the three men the plan of action.
THE WOLF
Okay first thing, you two.
(meaning Jules and Vincent) Take the body, stick it in the trunk. Now Jimmie, this looks to be a pretty domesticated house. That would lead me to believe that in the garage or under the sink, you got a bunch of cleaners and cleaners and shit like that, am I correct?
JIMMIE
Yeah. Exactly. Under the sink.
THE WOLF
Good. What I need you two fellas to do is take those cleaning products and clean the inside of the car. And I'm talkin' fast, fast, fast. You need to go in the backseat, scoop up all those little pieces of brain and skull. Get it out of there. Wipe down the upholstery – now when it comes to upholstery, it don't need to be spic and span, you don't need to eat off in. Give it a good once over. What you need to take care of are the really messy parts. The pools of blood that have collected, you gotta soak that shit up. But the windows are a different story. Them you really clean. Get the Windex, do a good job. Now Jimmie, we need to raid your linen closet. I need blankets, I need comforters, I need quilts, I need bedspreads. The thicker the better, the darker the better. No whites, can't use 'em. We need to camouflage the interior of the car. We're gonna line the front seat and the backseat and the floor boards with quilts and blankets. If a cop stops us and starts stickin' his big snout in the car, the subterfuge won't last. But at a glance, the car will appear to be normal. Jimmie – lead the way, boys – get to work.
The Wolf and Jimmie turn, heading for the bedroom, leaving Vincent and Jules standing in the kitchen.
VINCENT
(calling after him)
A "please" would be nice.
The Wolf stops and turns around.
THE WOLF
Come again?
VINCENT
I said a "please" would be nice.
The Wolf takes a step toward him.
THE WOLF
Set is straight, Buster. I'm not here to say "please."I'm here to tell you want to do. And if self-preservation is an instinct you possess, you better fuckin' do it and do it quick. I'm here to help. If my help's not appreciated, lotsa luck gentlemen.
JULES
It ain't that way, Mr. Wolf. Your help is definitely appreciated.
VINCENT
I don't mean any disrespect. I just don't like people barkin' orders at me.
THE WOLF
If I'm curt with you, it's because time is a factor. I think fast, I talk fast, and I need you guys to act fast if you want to get out of this. So pretty please, with sugar on top, clean the fuckin' car.
INT. JIMMIE'S BEDROOM – MORNING
Jimmie's gathering all the bedspreads, quilts and linen he has.
The Wolf is on the phone.
THE WOLF
(into phone)
It's a 1974 Chevy Nova.
(pause)
White.
(pause)
Nothin', except for the mess inside.
(pause)
About twenty minutes.
(pause)
Nobody who'll be missed.
(pause)
You're a good man, Joe. See ya soon.
(he looks at Jimmie)
How we comin', Jimmie?
Jimmie comes over with a handful of linen.
JIMMIE
Mr. Wolf, you gotta understand somethin' –
THE WOLF
– Winston, Jimmie – please, Winston.
JIMMIE
You gotta understand something, Winston. I want to help you guys out and all, but that's my best linen. It was a wedding present from my Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny, and they ain't with us anymore –
THE WOLF
– let me ask you a question, if you don't mind?
JIMMIE
Sure.
THE WOLF
Were you Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny
millionaires?
JIMMIE
No.
THE WOLF
Well, your Uncle Marsellus is. And I'm positive if Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny were millionaires, they would've furnished you with a whole bedroom set, which your Uncle Marsellus is more than happy to do.
(takes out a roll of bills) I like oak myself, that's what's in my bedroom. How 'bout you Jimmie, you an oak man?
JIMMIE
Oak's nice.
INT. GARAGE – MORNING
Both Jules and Vincent are inside the car cleaning it up. Vincent is in the front seat washing windows, while Jules is in the backseat, picking up little pieces of skull and gobs of brain. Both are twice as bloody as they were before.
JULES
I will never forgive your ass for this
shit. This is some fucked-up repugnant
shit!
VINCENT
Did you ever hear the philosophy that once a man admits he's wrong, he's immediately forgiven for all wrong-doings?
JULES
Man, get outta my face with that shit! The motherfucker who said that never had to pick up itty-bitty pieces of skull with his fingers on account of your dumb ass.
VINCENT
I got a threshold, Jules. I got a threshold for the abuse I'll take. And you're crossin' it. I'm a race car and you got me in the red. Redline 7000, that's where you are. Just know, it's fuckin' dangerous to be drivin' a race car when it's in the red. It could blow.
JULES
You're gettin' ready to blow? I'm a mushroom-cloud-layin' motherfucker! Every time my fingers touch brain I'm "SUPERFLY T.N.T," I'm the "GUNS OF NAVARONE." I'm what Jimmie Walker usta talk about. In fact, what the fuck am I doin' in the back? You're the motherfucker should be on brain detail. We're tradin'. I'm washin' windows and you're pickin' up this nigger's skull.
INT. CHEVY NOVA – MORNING
The interior of the car has been cleaned and lined with bedspreads and quilts. Believe it or not, what looked like a portable slaughterhouse can actually pass for a non-descript vehicle.
The Wolf circles the car examining it.
Jules and Vincent stand aside, their clothes are literally a bloody mess, but they do have a sense of pride in what a good job they've done.
THE WOLF
Fine job, gentlemen. We may get out of
this yet.
JIMMIE
I can't believe that's the same car.
THE WOLF
Well, let's	not start suckin'	each other's
dicks	quite	yet. Phase one is	complete,
clean	the car, which moves us	right along
to phase two, clean you two.
EXT. JIMMIE'S BACKYARD – MORNING
Jules and Vincent stand side by side in their black suits, covered in blood, in Jimmie's backyard. Jimmie holds a plastic Hefty trash bag, while The Wolf holds a garden hose with one of those guns nossles attached.
THE WOLF
Strip.
VINCENT
All the way?
THE WOLF
To your bare ass.
As they follow directions, The Wolf enjoys a smoke.
THE WOLF
Quickly gentlemen, we got about fifteen minutes before Jimmie's better-half comes pulling into the driveway.
JULES
This morning air is some chilly shit.
VINCENT
Are you sure this is absolutely necessary?
THE WOLF
You know what you two look like?
VINCENT
What?
THE WOLF
Like a couple of guys who just blew off somebody's head. Yes, strippin' off those bloody rags is absolutely necessary. Toss the clothes in Jim's garbage bag.
JULES
Now Jimmie, don't do nothin' stupid like puttin' that out in front of your house for Elmo the garbage man to take away.
THE WOLF
Don't worry, we're takin' it with us. Jim, the soap.
He hands the now-naked men a bar of soap.
THE WOLF
Okay gentlemen, you're both been to County before, I'm sure. Here it comes.
He hits the trigger, water SHOOTS OUT, SMACKING both men.
JULES
Goddamn, that water's fuckin' cold!
THE WOLF
Better you than me, gentlemen.
The two men, trembling, scrub themselves.
THE WOLF
Don't be afraid of the soap, spread it
around.
The Wolf stops the hose, tossing it on the ground.
THE WOLF
Towel 'em.
Jimmie tosses them each a towel, which they rub furiously across their bodies.
THE WOLF
You're dry enough, give 'em their clothes.
FADE UP ON:
JULES ANDVINCENT
In their tee-shirts and swim trunks. They look a million miles away from the black-suited, bad-asses we first met.
THE WOLF
Perfect. Perfect. We couldn't've planned this better. You guys look like...  what do they look like, Jimmie?
JIMMIE
Dorks. They look like a couple of dorks.
The Wolf and Jimmie laugh.
JULES
Ha ha ha. They're your clothes,
motherfucker.
JIMMIE
I guess you just gotta know how to wear
them.
JULES
Yeah, well, out asses ain't the expert on wearin' dorky shit that your is.
THE WOLF
C'mon, gentlemen, we're laughin' and jokin' our way into prison. Don't make me beg.
INT. JIMMIE'S GARAGE – MORNING
The garbage bag is tossed in the car trunk on top of Marvin. The Wolf SLAMS is closed.
THE WOLF
Gentlemen, let's get our rules of the road straight. We're going to a place called Monster Joe's Truck and Tow. Monster Joe and his daughter Raquel are sympathetic to out dilemma. The place is North Hollywood, so a few twist and turns aside, we'll be goin' up Hollywood Way. Now I'll drive the tainted car. Jules, you ride with me. Vincent, you follow in my Porsche. Now if we cross the path of any John Q. Laws, nobody does a fuckin' thing 'til I do something.
(to Jules)
What did I say?
JULES
Don't do shit unless –
THE WOLF
– unless what?
JULES
Unless you do it first.
THE WOLF
Spoken like a true prodigy.
(to Vincent)
How 'bout you, Lash Larue? Can you keep
your spurs from jingling and jangling?
VINCENT
I'm cool, Mr. Wolf. My gun just went off, I dunno how.
THE WOLF
Fair enough.
(he throws Vince his car keys) I drive real fuckin' fast, so keep up. If I get my car back any different than I gave it, Monster Joe's gonna be disposing of two bodies.
EXT. MONSTER JOE'S TRUCK AND TOW – MORNING
Jules and Vincent wait by Winston's Porsche.
JULES
We cool?
WINSTON
Like it never happened.
Jules and Vincent bump fists.
WINSTON
Boys, this is Raquel. Someday, all this
will be hers.
RAQUEL
(to the boys)
Hi. You know, if they ever do "I SPY: THE MOTION PICTURE," you guys, I'd be great. What's with the outfits. You guys going to a volleyball game?
Winston laughs, the boys groan.
WINSTON
I'm takin' m'lady out to breakfast. Maybe
I can drop you two off. Where do you live?
VINCENT
Redondo Beach.
JULES
Inglewood.
Winston grabs Jules' wrist and pantomimes like he's in a "DEAD ZONE" trance.
WINSTON
(painfully)
It's your future: I see...  a cab ride.
(dropping the act)
Sorry guys, move out of the sticks.
(to Raquel)
Say goodbye, Raquel
RAQUEL
Goodbye, Raquel.
WINSTON
I'll see you two around, and stay outta
trouble, you crazy kids.
Winston turns to leave.
JULES
Mr. Wolf.
He turns around.
JULES
I was a pleasure watchin' you work.
The Wolf smiles.
WINSTON
Call me Winston.
He turns and banters with Raquel as they get in the Porsche.
WINSTON
You hear that, young lady? Respect. You could lean a lot from those two fine specimens. Respect for one's elders shows character.
RAQUEL
I have character.
WINSTON
Just because you are a character doesn't mean you have character.
RAQUEL
Oh you're so funny, oh you're so funny.
The Porsche SHOOTS OFF down the road.
The two men left alone look at each other.
JULES
Wanna share a cab?
VINCENT
You know I could go for some breakfast.
What to have breakfast with me?
JULES
Sure.
INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING
Jules and Vincent sit at a booth. In front of Vincent is a big stack of pancakes and sausages, which he eats with gusto. Jules, on the other hand, just has a cup of coffee and a muffin. He seems far away in thought. The Waitress pours a refill for both men,
VINCENT
Thanks a bunch.
(to Jules, who's nursing his coffee)
Want a sausage?
JULES
Naw, I don't eat pork.
VINCENT
Are you Jewish?
JULES
I ain't Jewish man, I just don't dig on
swine.
VINCENT
Why not?
JULES
They're filthy animals. I don't eat filthy animals.
VINCENT
Sausages taste good. Pork chops taste
good.
JULES
A sewer rat may taste like pumpkin pie. I'll never know 'cause even if it did, I wouldn't eat the filthy motherfucker. Pigs sleep and root in shit. That's a filthy animal. I don't wanna eat nothin' that ain't got enough sense to disregard its own feces.
VINCENT
How about dogs? Dogs eat their own feces.
JULES
I don't eat dog either.
VINCENT
Yes, but do you consider a dog to be a
filthy animal?
JULES
I wouldn't go so far as to call a dog filthy, but they're definitely dirty. But a dog's got personality. And personality goes a long way.
VINCENT
So by that rationale, if a pig had a
better personality, he's cease to be a
filthy animal?
JULES
We'd have to be talkin' 'bout one motherfuckin' charmin' pig. It'd have to be the Cary Grant of pigs.
The two men laugh.
VINCENT
Good for you. Lighten up a little. You
been sittin' there all quiet.
JULES
I just been sittin' here thinkin'.
VINCENT
(mouthful of food)
About what?
JULES
The miracle we witnessed.
VINCENT
The miracle you witnessed. I witnessed a freak occurrence.
JULES
Do you know that a miracle is?
VINCENT
An act of God.
JULES
What's an act of God?
VINCENT
I guess it's when God makes the impossible possible. And I'm sorry Jules, but I don't think what happened this morning qualifies.
JULES
Don't you see, Vince, that shit don't matter. You're judging this thing the wrong way. It's not about what. It could be God stopped the bullets, he changed Coke into Pepsi, he found my fuckin' car keys. You don't judge shit like this based on merit. Whether or not what we experienced was an according-to-Hoyle miracle is insignificant. What is significant is I felt God's touch, God got involved.
VINCENT
But why?
JULES
That's what's fuckin' wit' me! I don't
know why. But I can't go back to sleep.
VINCENT
So you're serious, you're really gonna
quit?
JULES
The life, most definitely.
Vincent takes a bite of food. Jules takes a sip of coffee In the b.g., we see a PATRON call the Waitress.
PATRON
Garcon! Coffee!
We recognize the patron to be Pumpkin from the first scene of Pumpkin and Honey Bunny.
VINCENT
So if you're quitting the life, what'll
you do?
JULES
That's what I've been sitting here contemplating. First, I'm gonna deliver this case to Marsellus. Then, basically, I'm gonna walk the earth.
VINCENT
What do you mean, walk the earth?
JULES
You know, like Caine in "KUNG FU." Just walk from town to town, meet people, get in adventures.
VINCENT
How long do you intend to walk the earth?
JULES
Until God puts me where he want me to be.
VINCENT
What if he never does?
JULES
If it takes forever, I'll wait forever.
VINCENT
So you decided to be a bum?
JULES
I'll just be Jules, Vincent – no more, no less.
VINCENT
No Jules, you're gonna be like those pieces of shit out there who beg for change. They walk around like a bunch of fuckin' zombies, they sleep in garbage bins, they eat what I throw away, and dogs piss on 'em. They got a word for 'em, they're called bums. And without a job, residence, or legal tender, that's what you're gonna be – a fuckin' bum!
JULES
Look my friend, this is just where me and you differ –
VINCENT
– what happened was peculiar – no doubt about it – but it wasn't water into wine.
JULES
All shapes and sizes, Vince.
VINCENT
Stop fuckin' talkin' like that!
JULES
If you find my answers frightening,
Vincent, you should cease askin' scary
questions.
VINCENT
I gotta take a shit. To be continued.
Vincent exitsfor the restroom.
Jules, alone, takes a mouthful of muffin, then...  Pumpkin and Honey Bunny rise with guns raised.
PUMPKIN
Everybody be cool, this is a robbery!
HONEY BUNNY
Any of you fuckin' pricks move and I'll
execute every one of you motherfuckers!
Got that?!
Jules looks up, not believing what he's seeing. Under the table, Jules' hand goes to his .45 Automatic. He pulls it out, COCKING IT.
PUMPKIN
Customers stay seated, waitresses on the floor.
HONEY BUNNY
Now mean fuckin' now! Do it or die, do it or fucking die!
Like lightning, Pumpkin moves over to the kitchen. While Honey Bunny SCREAMS out threats to the PATRONS, keeping them terrified.
PUMPKIN
You Mexicans in the kitchen, get out here!
Asta luego!
Three COOKS and two BUSBOYS come out of the kitchen.
PUMPKIN
On the floor or I'll cook you ass,
comprende?
They comprende. The portly MANAGER speaks up.
MANAGER
I'm the manager here, there's no problem, no problem at all –
Pumpkin head his way.
PUMPKIN
You're gonna give me a problem?
He reaches him and sticks the barrel of his gun hard in the Manager's neck.
PUMPKIN
What? You said you're gonna give me a
problem?
MANAGER
No, I'm not. I'm not gonna give you any
problem!
PUMPKIN
I don't know, Honey Bunny. He looks like the hero type to me!
HONEY BUNNY
Don't take any chances. Execute him!
The Patrons SCREAM. Jules watches all this silently, his hand tightly gripping the .45 Automatic under the table.
MANAGER
Please don't! I'm not a hero. I'm just a coffee shop manager. Take anything you want.
PUMPKIN
Tell everyone to cooperate and it'll be
all over.
MANAGER
Everybody just be calm and cooperate with them and this will be all over soon!
PUMPKIN
Well done, now git your fuckin' ass on the ground.
INT. COFFEE SHOP BATHROOM – MORNING
Vincent, on the toilet, oblivious to the pandemonium outside, reads his "MODESTY BLAISE" book.
INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING
Cash register drawer opens. Pumpkin stuffs the money from the till in his pocket. Then walks from behind the counter with a trash bag in his hand.
PUMPKIN
Okay people, I'm going to go 'round and
collect your wallets. Don't talk, just
toss 'em in the bag. We clear?
Pumpkin goes around collecting wallets. Jules sits with his .45 ready to spit under the table.
Pumpkin sees Jules sitting in his booth, holding his wallet, briefcase next to him. Pumpkin crosses to him, his tone more respectful, him manner more on guard.
PUMPKIN
In the bag.
Jules DROPS his wallet in the bag. Using his gun as a pointer, Pumpkin points to the briefcase.
PUMPKIN
What's in that?
JULES
My boss' dirty laundry.
PUMPKIN
You boss makes you do his laundry?
JULES
When he wants it clean.
PUMPKIN
Sounds like a shit job.
JULES
Funny, I've been thinkin' the same thing.
PUMPKIN
Open it up.
Jules' free hand lays palm flat on the briefcase.
JULES
'Fraid I can't do that.
Pumpkin is definitely surprised by his answer. He aims the gun right in the middle of Jules' face and pulls back the hammer.
PUMPKIN
I didn't hear you.
JULES
Yes, you did.
This exchange has been kind of quiet, not everybody heard it, but Honey Bunny senses something's wrong.
HONEY BUNNY
What's goin' on?
PUMPKIN
Looks like we got a vigilante in our
midst.
HONEY BUNNY
Shoot 'em in the face!
JULES
I don't mean to shatter your ego, but this ain't the first time I've had gun pointed at me.
PUMPKIN
You don't open up that case, it's gonna be the last.
MANAGER
(on the ground)
Quit causing problems, you'll get us all killed! Give 'em what you got and get 'em out of here.
JULES
Keep your fuckin' mouth closed, fat man, this ain't any of your goddamn business!
PUMPKIN
I'm countin' to three, and if your hand ain't off that case, I'm gonna unload right in your fuckin' face. Clear? One... 
PUMPKIN
...  two...  three.
JULES
You win.
Jules raises his hand off the briefcase.
JULES
It's all yours, Ringo.
PUMPKIN
Open it.
Jules flips the locks and opens the case, revealing it to Pumpkin but not to us. The same light SHINES from the case. Pumpkin's expression goes to amazement. Honey Bunny, across the room, can't see shit.
HONEY BUNNY
What is it? What is it?
PUMPKIN
(softly)
Is that what I think it is?
Jules nods his head: "yes."
PUMPKIN
It's beautiful.
Jules nods his head: "yes."
HONEY BUNNY
Goddammit, what is it?
Jules SLAMS the case closed, then sits back, as if offering the case to Pumpkin. Pumpkin, one big smile, bends over to pick up the case.
Like a rattlesnake, Jules' free hand GRABS the wrist of Pumpkin's gun hand, SLAMMING it on the table. His other hand comes from under the table and STICKS the barrel of his .45 hand under Pumpkin's chin.
Honey Bunny freaks out, waving his gun in Jules' direction.
HONEY BUNNY
Let him go! Let him go! I'll blow your fuckin' head off! I'll kill ya! I'll kill ya! You're gonna die, you're gonna fuckin' die bad!
JULES
(to Pumpkin)
Tell that bitch to be cool! Say, bitch be cool! Say, bitch be cool!
PUMPKIN
Chill out, honey!
HONEY BUNNY
Let him go!
JULES
(softly)
Tell her it's gonna be okay.
PUMPKIN
I'm gonna be okay.
JULES
Promise her.
PUMPKIN
I promise.
JULES
Tell her to chill.
PUMPKIN
Just chill out.
JULES
What's her name?
PUMPKIN
Yolanda.
Whenever Jules talks to Yolanda, he never looks at her, only at Pumpkin.
JULES
(to Yolanda)
So, we cool Yolanda? We ain't gonna do
anything stupid, are we?
YOLANDA
(crying)
Don't you hurt him.
JULES
Nobody's gonna hurt anybody. We're gonna be like three Fonzies. And what' Fonzie like?
No answer.
JULES
C'mon Yolanda, what's Fonzie like?
YOLANDA
(through tears, unsure)
He's cool?
JULES
Correct-amundo! And that's what we're
gonna be, we're gonna be cool.
(to Pumpkin)
Now Ringo, I'm gonna count to three and I want you to let go your gun and lay your palms flat on the table. But when you do it, do it cool. Ready?
Pumpkin looks at him.
JULES
One...  two...  three.
Pumpkin lets go of his gun and places both hands on the table.
Yolanda can't stand it anymore.
YOLANDA
Okay, now let him go!
JULES
Yolanda, I thought you were gonna be cool. When you yell at me, it makes me nervous. When I get nervous, I get scared. And when motherfuckers get scared, that's when motherfuckers get accidentally shot.
YOLANDA
(more conversational)
Just know: you hurt him, you die.
JULES
That seems to be the situation. Now I don't want that and you don't want that and Ringo here don't want that. So let's see what we can do.
(to Ringo)
Now this is the situation. Normally both of your asses would be dead as fuckin' fried chicken. But you appened to pull this shit while I'm in a transitional period. I don't wanna kill ya, I want to help ya. But I'm afraid I can't give you the case. It don't belong to me. Besides, I went through too much shit this morning on account of this case to just hand it over to your ass.
VINCENT (O.S.)
What the fuck's goin' on here?
Yolanda WHIPS her gun toward the stranger.
Vincent, by the bathroom, has his gun out, dead-aimed at Yolanda.
JULES
It's cool, Vincent! It's cool! Don't do a goddamn thing. Yolanda, it's cool baby, nothin's changed. We're still just talkin'.
(to Pumpkin)
Tell her we're still cool.
PUMPKIN
It's cool, Honey Bunny, we're still cool.
VINCENT
(gun raised)
What the hell's goin' on, Jules?
JULES
Nothin' I can't handle. I want you to just hang back and don't do shit unless it's absolutely necessary.
VINCENT
Check.
JULES
Yolanda, how we doin, baby?
YOLANDA
I gotta go pee! I want to go home.
JULES
Just hang in there, baby, you're doing'
great,Ringo's proud of you and so am I.
It's almost over.
(to Pumpkin)
Now I want you to go in that bag and find my wallet.
PUMPKIN
Which one is it?
JULES
It's the one that says Bad Motherfucker on it.
Pumpkin looks in the bag and – sure enough – there's a wallet with "Bad Motherfucker" embroidered on it.
JULES
That's my bad motherfucker. Now open it up and take out the cash. How much is there?
PUMPKIN
About fifteen hundred dollars.
JULES
Put it in your pocket, it's yours. Now
with the rest of them wallets and the
register, that makes this a pretty
successful little score.
VINCENT
Jules, if you give this nimrod fifteen
hundred buck, I'm gonna shoot 'em on
general principle.
JULES
You ain't gonna do a goddamn thing, now hang back and shut the fuck up. Besides, I ain't givin' it to him. I'm buyin' somethin' for my money. Wanna know what I'm buyin' Ringo?
PUMPKIN
What?
JULES
Your life. I'm givin' you that money so I don't hafta kill your ass. You read the Bible?
PUMPKIN
Not regularly.
JULES
There's a passage I got memorized. Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of the darkness. For he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know I am the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon you."I been sayin' that shit for years. And if you ever heard it, it meant your ass. I never really questioned what it meant. I thought it was just a cold-blooded thing to say to a motherfucker 'fore you popped a cap in his ass. But I saw some shit this mornin' made me think twice. Now I'm thinkin', it could mean you're the evil man. And I'm the righteous man. And Mr. .45 here, he's the shepherd protecting my righteous ass in the valley of darkness. Or is could by you're the righteous man and I'm the shepherd and it's the world that's evil and selfish.
(MORE)
JULES (CONT'D)
I'd like that. But that shit ain't the truth. The truth is you're the weak. And I'm the tyranny of evil men. But I'm tryin'. I'm tryin' real hard to be a shepherd.
Jules lowers his gun, lying it on the table.
Pumpkin looks at him, to the money in his hand, then to Yolanda.
She looks back.
Grabbing the trash bag full of wallets, the two RUN out the door.
Jules, who was never risen from his seat the whole time, takes a sip of coffee.
JULES
(to himself)
It's cold.
He pushes it aside.
Vincent appears next to Jules.
VINCENT
I think we oughta leave now.
JULES
That's probably a good idea.
Vincent throws some money on the table and Jules grabs the briefcase.
Then, to the amazement of the Patrons, the Waitresses, the Cooks, the Bus Boys, and the Manager, these two bad-ass dudes – wearing UC Santa Cruz and "I'm with Stupid" tee-shirts, swim trunks, thongs and packing .45 Automatics – walk out of the coffee shop together without saying a word.
FADE OUT
THE END
