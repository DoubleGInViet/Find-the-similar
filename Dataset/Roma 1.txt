INT. PATIO TEPEJI 21 - DAY

Yellow triangles inside red squares.

Water spreading over tiles. Grimy foam.

The tile floor of a long and narrow patio stretching through the entire house: On one end, a black metal door gives onto the street. The door has frosted glass windows, two of which are broken, courtesy of some dejected goalee.

CLEO, Cleotilde/Cleodegaria Gutiérrez, a Mixtec indigenous woman, about 26 years old, walks across the patio, nudging water over the wet floor with a squeegee.

As she reaches the other end, the foam has amassed in a corner, timidly showing off its shiny little white bubbles, but -

A GUSH OF WATER surprises and drags the stubborn little bubbles to the corner where they finally vanish, whirling into the sewer.

Cleo picks up the brooms and buckets and carries them to -

THE SMALL PATIO -

Which is enclosed between the kitchen, the garage and the house. She opens the door to a small closet, puts away the brooms and buckets, walks into a small bathroom and closes the door.

The patio remains silent except for a radio announcer, his enthusiasm melting in the distance, and the sad song of two caged little birds.

The toilet flushes. Then: water from the sink. A beat, the door opens.

Cleo dries her hands on her apron, enters the kitchen and disappears behind the door connecting it to the house.

INT - GROUND FLOOR - TEPEJI 21 - DAY

Cleo crosses the dark, antique wood breakfast room, then the modern light and angled wood dining room and goes up the stairs, reaching the hall.

Beyond the hall there are two living rooms, one with heavy green velvet sofas and antique cabinets with records and a stereo. There’s a piano next to the wall.
 
2.


CONTINUED:

The other living room, with its light sofas and cocktail tray and siphon attempts to look more modern.

There’s a giant painting in red and purple hues of a woman leaning on a clay pitcher.

In the other living room, there’s another painting, also large but more somber: In a dark stone cell, a monk brings solace to a shackled prisoner who covers his face with his hands in desperation.

INT - UPPER LEVEL - TEPEJI 21 - DAY

The stairs go up to a central hall surrounded by four bedrooms and an enormous bathroom.

Cleo makes up the bedroom: the double bed is already made, it has an ornate mahogany headboard that matches the night tables.

She collects the dirty clothes from the floor and carries them out to the hall where she piles them up onto a growing mound of laundry.

The upstairs hallway doubles as a TV room. The bathroom is yet to be cleaned but two out of three bedrooms are completely done.

Cleo walks into a room with two small beds for the kids. She picks up the clothes first, and then puts away the boy and girl toys spread across the entire floor.

She’s started making one of the beds when she hears someone calling from downstairs -

ADELA (O.S.)
Manita! It’s almost one...!

Startled, Cleo exclaims -

CLEO
Ay, chicú...!

She exits the bedroom carrying dirty laundry.

In the hallway, she gathers the pile of clothing and carries it, hurrying down the stairs.

INT - DOWNSTAIRS - TEPEJI 21 - DAY

Cleo heads down the stairs, carrying the pile of clothes.
 
3.


She crosses the hall and dining rooms and disappears behind the door that opens to the kitchen.

After a beat, through -

THE WINDOW

We see her exit to the small patio.

She leaves the clothes at the foot of the metal stairs that lead to the roof and hurries out to the street.

EXT - HOUSE - TEPEJI 21 - DAY

Tepeji street spans barely two blocks, halved by Monterrey Avenue, its tired homes built in the 1930s.

Sad and defeated, Tepeji 21 sits in the middle of the block resting on its solid ground, which blends with the grey concrete of the sidewalk.

The house is all white save for an almost-maroon red strip running along its facade and for the black wrought iron over the windows and doors.

Next to the upper left hand corner of the door there’s a ceramic tile number: 21.

The door opens and Cleo exits.

She hurries out to the Avenue and once she reaches the corner, she turns right.

EXT - STREET - MONTERREY AVE. - TLAXCALA - DAY

Cleo leaves Tepeji and walks down the avenue where there’s a considerable amount of traffic.

As she reaches the corner, she crosses the avenue and continues on -

TLAXCALA STREET -

She passes a pharmacy, a convenience store, a bakery and a beauty salon.

EXT - CONDESA KINDERGARTEN - DAY

A small crowd gathers by the kindergarten entrance. It’s pickup time. Cleo arrives and goes into the school. After a moment, she comes out with PEPE, a 5 year-old boy carrying a barely dried “work of art”.

EXT - TLAXCALA STREET - DAY
 
4.


Cleo walks next to Pepe, who carries his “work of art”: just a little kid in shorts and t-shirt.

Pepe walks, skipping around not to step on the line. Cleo carries his lunch box.

Suddenly, Pepe stops and sits down. Cleo keeps walking a few steps, then stops, turns around -

CLEO (CONT’D)
What’s wrong?

PEPE
I’m tired.

CLEO
Well, let’s go then so we can get
home. As soon as we get there you

can go straight to bed!

PEPE
I can’t.

Cleo pretends to keep walking.

PEPE (CONT’D)
Mom!

Cleo stops and turns around -

CLEO
Of course you can! Come on! Let’s

go!

PEPE
I said I can’t!

CLEO
If I went to bed every time I thought “I can’t”, I would live in bed!

PEPE
I’m not in bed.

Cleo takes his hand -

CLEO
Come on, there’s pasta soup...

Pepe gets up -

PEPE
Ooooooooooh!
 
5.


CONTINUED:

And he starts with heavy and lazy steps.

PEPE (CONT’D)
Mooooooooooooom!

CLEO
C’mon little soldier, 1, 2, 3, 4...

march!

The two march hand in hand.

EXT - PATIO - TEPEJI 21 - DAY

Cleo and Pepe walk in: he’s carrying his “work of art” while she carries the lunch box. They listen to Adela calling her -

ADELA (O.S.)
(In Mixtec)

Hurry up, manita! Fermín is on the phone!

Cleo hurries and goes inside the house to answer.

INT - DOWNSTAIRS HALL - TEPEJI 21 - DAY

CLEO
Hello?

INT - KITCHEN - TEPEJI 21 - DAY

Adela is cooking: pots simmer on the stove. Cleo walks in, leaving the lunch box on the table.

ADELA
(In Mixtec)

So, what did he say?

CLEO
Nothing! He just called to say hi!

Cleo picks up dishes and glasses, carries them out.

Adela stirs the soup.

Cleo comes in again and opens the silverware drawer.

ADELA
Sure... Now you’ve stolen my

boyfriend, right?
 
6.


CLEO
What? You crazy? Fermín is only my friend. Plus, you’re the one who introduced us.

ADELA
Ay, manita! Look at you! I’m just messing with you. I only went out twice with him and didn’t even let him kiss me.

We hear the street door opening and with it a commotion of kids.

CLEO
They’re here...

Cleo exits to -

EXT - PATIO - TEPEJI 21 - DAY

Cleo reaches the patio just as -

Two children run in -

TOÑO, 12 years old and PACO, 11. The two rush into the house and we hear them go up the stairs.

Soon after, SOFI, an 8 year-old girl comes in. She’s very pretty although her brothers constantly pick on her, calling her fat.

Trailing behind, comes SEÑORA TERESA, a 65 year-old widow, hair completely white, walking with a limp.

IGNACIO, the 45 year-old driver, follows her, carrying a grocery bag.

INT - BREAKFAST ROOM - TEPEJI 21 - DAY

Cleo cuts Pepe’s meat with a knife, she cuts ever-smaller pieces, until only tiny squares of steak remain. She douses them with lemon.

SOFI impatiently waits her turn.

PACO eats his meat while he talks -

PACO
A friend told me that a kid in his cousin’s school was killed by a soldier because he threw a water balloon at him.
 
7.


CONTINUED:

Toño listens skeptically -

TOÑO
Says who?

PACO
Says Flores. If you don’t believe me, ask him. He says he was in Chapultepec, near the new one, and that he was with his brother, throwing water balloons down at the passing cars and so an army Jeep passed and they threw one and the soldier got off and shot him.

CLEO
Jesus! And what happened to him?

PACO
What do you mean, what happened? He got shot in the head, he’s dead.

CLEO
Horrible!

SEÑORA SOFÍA enters through the hallway door, carrying a backpack and a bunch of papers from the dining room table -

SEÑORA SOFÍA
Hello children, what are you

eating?

SOFI AND PEPE
Mom!

Señora Sofía kisses each one hello. Pepe shows her his “work of art” -

PEPE
Look, mommy...

SEÑORA SOFÍA
Beautiful! Did you make that all by

yourself?

PEPE
Yes, and look: there’s pasta soup!

SEÑORA SOFÍA
Yummm, delicious!

She sits -
 
8.


SEÑORA SOFÍA (CONT’D) Cleo, please don’t let the kids touch those papers-they’re exams I have to grade.

TOÑO
Is there any watermelon?

CLEO
No, love. Strawberries and cream.

PACO
I want some!

Cleo gets up, taking some dirty dishes with her-

CLEO
What about you, Toño?

TOÑO
I guess so.

Cleo goes to -

INT - KITCHEN - TEPEJI 21 - DAY

Cleo comes in with the dirty dishes, puts them in the sink.

Ignacio and Adela eat at a small table.

Cleo takes a clean bowl and starts pouring soup -

CLEO
Ándali, the señora is here. Sofía and Toño want their strawberries...

Adela gets up, slowly, and puts some plates, spoons, strawberries, sugar and cream on a platter. She looks at Cleo with a question and smiles.

Cleo blushes and leaves, carrying her platter.

INT - BREAKFAST ROOM - TEPEJI 21 - DAY

Señora Sofía eats her soup.

Cleo fixes the strawberries and cream on plates.

SEÑORA SOFÍA
Cleo, could you please send the señor’s two suits to the dry cleaners. It has to be today because he’s leaving on Friday and has to pack them.
 
9.


CLEO
Don’t worry, ma’am, I’ll take them.

PEPE
Is dad going on a trip?

SEÑORA SOFÍA
He’s going to Quebec for a

conference.

SOFI
Where’s that?

PACO
How come you don’t know, silly?

SOFI
I don’t. So what?

TOÑO
It’s in Canada.

PACO
Is he flying Eastern?

SEÑORA SOFÍA
I don’t know. I think it’s Panam.

Cleo serves Sofi a plate of strawberries and cream.

SEÑORA SOFÍA (CONT’D)
No sugar for Sofi, or she’ll get

fat.



EXT - ROOF- TEPEJI 21 - AFTERNOON

Cleo washes clothes, occasionally humming to a song coming out of a yellow radio.

The metallic creak of the stairs announces the arrival of Paco, followed by Pepe.

CLEO
You know you can’t come up here.

PACO
I looked after him the whole way

up.
 
10.


CONTINUED:

CLEO
Your mom is going to be angry.

But Paco has started his game, pulling Pepe along with him.

PACO
I’m going to come out of here and you come over here, and when I get to here you’ll shoot me, but I’ll shoot you first and you’ll fall dead... Like this... with your arms wide open...

Paco takes bullets like Sonny Corleone against the wall of the neighboring house.

CLEO
Just don’t play next to the edge.

PACO
C’mon...

Paco moves away on the roof while Pepe hides behind the water tank.

Paco comes back, but now hiding like an enemy spy all the way to the water tank. He tries to go around it, with his gun held high, but -

Pepe comes at him from behind, with murderous intent.

Paco reacts and turns around, tries to point with his gun but Pepe sprays him with sure shots and hides behind the water tank leaving Paco confused at first, then furious-

PACO (CONT’D)
You were supposed to die!

From behind the water tank, Pepe defies him -

PEPE
Why aren’t you the one who dies?

PACO
Cause it’s my game.

PEPE
Then I don’t wanna play anymore.
 
11.


CONTINUED:

PACO
Well, then I don’t want you to

play, sissy.

He walks off, angry. He goes down the staircase, each step resonating with metallic moans.

Pepe walks over to see him go and stops in the middle of the roof, clearly disappointed.

He stays there for a long time, until suddenly -

A spray of invisible bullets shoots through him and Pepe falls dead, his arms spread open, like Paco said. And he stays there, lying down motionless on the ground.

Cleo dries her hands and walks over to him. She stops and watches him -

CLEO
What happened to you?

Without opening his eyes, Pepe answers from the ground.

PEPE
I’m dead.

CLEO
Well, let’s go down then.

PEPE
I can’t. I’m dead.

CLEO
Then come back to life, we have to go down!

PEPE
If you die, you can’t live again.

CLEO
Now what am I going to do without

my Pepe!?

Cleo sits on the ground next to Pepe, who remains motionless.

CLEO (CONT’D)
I can’t live without my Pepe!

Cleo lies down next to Pepe, arms also extended, and closes her eyes -
 
12.


CONTINUED:

CLEO (CONT’D)
I’m also dead.

And so she remains still, Pepe next to her. A DC 8 flies overhead.

Pepe opens an eye to see Cleo. She’s not moving and seems not to be breathing at all. Pepe reaches his hand and takes Cleo’s.

PEPE
Cleo...?

But Cleo’s not moving. Pepe sits up -

PEPE (CONT’D)
Cleo...?

CLEO
I’m dead.

PEPE
No! C’mon, get up!

CLEO
Didn’t you say that was impossible?

PEPE
Cleo, stop it!

But Cleo doesn’t answer.

PEPE (CONT’D)
Cleo!

She remains still.

PEPE (CONT’D)
Cleeoo!

Pepe’s starting to get scared -

PEPE (CONT’D)
Cleeeeeeeeooooooo!

Cleo opens her eyes and smiles at him.

CLEO
I’m playing your game. Let’s see...

shall we play a little longer?

Pepe lies down next to her, arms outstretched.
 
13.


CONTINUED:

CLEO (CONT’D)
Close your eyes.

They both close their eyes.

CLEO (CONT’D)
I like being dead.

Pepe holds her hand.

The two of them lie dead on the roof -

The afternoon quiet hours have begun. Church bells ring in the distance.

All around them, a landscape of roofs mushrooming in all directions.

In many of them, other women wash or hang laundry. The wind carries the hum of different radios and dogs barking.

The whistle of a sweet potato cart.

The quiet universe.



INT - MAIN BATHROOM - TEPEJI 21 - NIGHT

Cleo bathes Sofi and Pepe in the bathtub.

Sofi’s hair is full of soap and she plays at making different hairdos in the mirror.

Pepe has a submarine but isn’t playing with it. He’s pensive.

PEPE
Cleo, if you died right now, would you go to heaven or hell?

CLEO
And why would I die?

PEPE
I’m just saying... Heaven or hell?

CLEO
You’re killing me all the time...

Pepe is getting annoyed.
 
14.


PEPE
Well, it’s a game! Tell me

already... heaven or hell?

Cleo	fills a small bucket with water and tells Sofi -

CLEO
Let’s see, close your eyes...

As she pours water to rinse her hair.

CLEO (CONT’D)
I’d fly straight up to heaven with my little wings.

PEPE
Paco told me that in his religion

class the had a sli-ding show...

CLEO
Sli-ding...?

Sofi laughs -

SOFI
Slide show.

PEPE
That thing. About hell.

Cleo pours another bucketful on Sofi.

CLEO
(uninterested)

Hell?

PEPE
Yep, paintings and photos....

CLEO
Photos?

PEPE
Yeah. He said there was fire on all sides... and that while they burn you, there’s some real ugly devils poking you, like this, with irons... and others that bite you or eat your arms....

CLEO
Ay chicú! horrible! Stop talking

about that...!
 
15.


CONTINUED:

PEPE
Yeah but it doesn’t matter...!

CLEO
What do you mean it doesn’t matter?

What about all the fire?

Pepe laughs -

PEPE
He says it doesn’t matter cause

that’s where he wants to go!

CLEO
What? But didn’t you say they burn people there?

PEPE
Yes, but Paco says everyone there

is naked!

His laugh is now roaring -

PEPE (CONT’D)
And that you can see all the

girls... naked!

Pepe is laughing hard, Sofi spits out water and laughs with him.


EXT. - PATIO - TEPEJI 21 - NIGHT

The frosted glass panels light up and we hear -

A horn honking -

Ta-ta ta-ta ta-ta ta-taaaaaaa!

Behind the door, the powerful and tantalizing hum of a V8.

From inside the car, booms XELA radio station playing “Un bal” from Symphonie Fantastique.

BORRAS immediately starts barking at the door.

Cleo and Adela rush to the patio-

ADELA
Well, he’s in early.

Cleo grabs Borras and drags him to the back of the patio.
 
16.


CONTINUED:

CLEO
Don’t you know he’s leaving

tomorrow?

Adela begins to open the door.

Pepe and Sofi peek out from the hall. Holding Borras, Cleo orders them to -

CLEO (CONT’D)
Wait there!

The V8 impatiently purrs behind the door and finally -

Adela opens the door to reveal -

The front of a 1970 2-DOOR BLACK GALAXIE 500. Its powerful headlights flood the patio all the way to the back, lighting Cleo who holds Borras.

The Galaxie 500 slowly pulls in but it’s too large for the space, leaving only about an inch on each side of the doors.

The front of the car is in, then it breaks -

The left side is about to touch the door frame.

The tires turn right accompanied by the SCREECH of rubber against tile.

The Galaxie 500 moves further in but then breaks again -

The right side is about to touch.

The black power steering wheel turns and -

The wheels veer left, SCREECHING.

It echoes through the patio, syncopated with the waltz emanating from the radio.

Señora Sofía comes to the hall door next to Sofi and Pepe.

SOFI
Dad’s home early!

The car moves forward a couple of inches and stops.

The gear shifts to R -

The Galaxie 500 backs up a few inches, breaks.
 
17.


CONTINUED:

The gear shifts to D -

The car inches forward slowly, free of the door frame. It’s almost halfway in when it stops.

The wheels veer right and -

SCREECH.

And the waltz picks up its rhythm.

The car moves forward half a yard and breaks.

The tires line straight up and -

The Galaxie 500 has made it through the door frame and is now entirely inside the patio -

As the waltz reaches its grand finale...

The car parks right next to the hall entrance door -

The engine shuts off, and with it, the music -

Sofi and Pepe lunge through the door -

SEÑOR ANTONIO
There, there, there.... Let me get

out.

Señora Sofía pulls the children to her and -

SEÑOR ANTONIO comes out of the car, he’s 40 years old with a few white hairs in his beard. He’s still wearing his white doctor’s coat.

The children jump on him immediately -

SEÑOR ANTONIO (CONT’D)
Who? Who? Who are these kids?

Señora Sofía touches his shoulder. The family comes in.

Adela closes the street door and Cleo sets Borras free. He immediately sniffs at the Galaxie 500’s tires.

INT - UPSTAIRS HALL - TEPEJI 21 - NIGHT

Gordolfo Gelatino exists his bedroom wearing a robe, stretching his arms lazily -
 
18.


(CONT’D)

GORDOLFO GELATINO (ON T.V.) Ya se despertó tu rorro, mamacita... (your baby’s up, lil’ mama)

Doña Naborita welcomes him enthusiastically -

DOÑA NABORITA (ON T.V.) My angel of the mornin’! Si a penas son las dos de la tarde! Ya descansanste de descansar? (It’s barely 2 pm! Have you rested from resting?)

The entire family is seated in front of a 1970 ADMIRAL TELEVISION SET.

Sofi is perched on Señor Antonio and Pepe’s on Señora Sofía’s lap, Paco leans on her, cuddling. Toño, always more distant, sits in an armchair.

Cleo serves Señor Antonio strawberries and cream. She picks up a plate with the remains of a concha and beans and head towards the stairs when -

Laughter explodes, courtesy of Los Polivoces. The kids are laughing hard in their seats.

Cleo stops and turns -

ONTV-

Gordolfo is sitting on the couch, admiring himself in the mirror, while Doña Naborita irons a pile of clothes.

DOÑA NABORITA (ON T.V.) (CONT’D) Ora sí, mi cerecita de jaibol, el edificio me dió toda su ropa a

lavar y voy a poder comprarte ese reloj que tanto te gusta...! (That’s right my little highball cherry, the entire building gave me their laundry to wash so I’m going to buy you that watch you like so much...!)

GORDOLFO GELATINO (ON T.V.)
No me gusta verte trabajar tanto, mi cabecita blanca adorada! Así que por favor vete al otro cuarto.

(MORE)
 
19.

GORDOLFO GELATINO (ON T.V.) (CONT'D)
(I don’t like to see you working so
hard my beloved little white
head... so please go to the other

room.)

Cleo sets aside the plates and sits down on the floor next to the sofa to watch T.V.

Paco holds out his arm to hug her.

Pepe tries doing the same but he can’t reach. Cleo extends her arm and hooks it with his.

ON T.V. -

A bump announces the Wash and Wear, who, minutes later enters his boss El Mostachón’s office. He will exploit him, immune to the insults and truths that the Wash and Wear dishes out.

SEÑORA SOFÍA
Cleo?

Cleo immediately stands up -

CLEO
Yes, ma'am?

SEÑORA SOFÍA
Would you bring the doctor some

chamomile tea?

CLEO
Yes, ma'am.

She picks up the plates from the floor and heads downstairs.

INT - KITCHEN - TEPEJI 21 - NIGHT

Adela is washing the dishes. Cleo comes in and leaves the dirty dishes next to the dishwasher.

CLEO (CONT’D)
Move over!

She bumps Adela with her hip.

ADELA
Órale!

CLEO
Make some chamomile tea for the

señora and get going.
 
20.


CONTINUED:

Adela obeys with mock-resignation and dries her hands with a rag -

ADELA
Just don’t take too long...

She grabs a pot and pours water from a carboy on the floor.

INT - UPSTAIRS HALL - TEPEJI 21 - NIGHT

Cleo walks in with a steaming cup of tea, places it on a table next to Señora Sofía. Pepe sleeps in her arms.

SEÑORA SOFÍA
Can you take him?

Cleo takes Pepe and carries him into his room. Sofi follows her. Cleo pauses before going in to watch -

ON T.V. -

Chano and Chon reveal their faces under their hats. Chano starts asking Chon about penguin sizes. Chon answers and Chano starts howling at the answer.

SEÑORA SOFÍA (CONT’D)
Off to bed, children...

Toño and Paco grudgingly get up and kiss their parents good night.

INT - SOFI AND PEPE’S ROOM - TEPEJI 21 - NIGHT

Sofi is lying down on her bed. Cleo sits next to her, taking her hand -

CLEO
Angelito de la Guarda, mi dulce compañía, no me desampares ni de noche ni de día. No me dejes sola que me perdería... (My guardian angel, sweet company, don’t leave me alone day or night. Don’t leave alone because I’d be lost...)

She strokes her face -

CLEO (CONT’D)
Night-night, beautiful Sofi...

And she gives her a kiss.
 
21.


CONTINUED:

SOFI
Good night, Cleo.

She closes her eyes. Cleo gets up and turns off the light.

She exits to -

INT - UPSTAIRS HALL - TEPEJI 21 - NIGHT

It’s empty. Paco and Toño’s door is closed but Señor Antonio and Señora Sofía’s is still open. Señor Antonio sits on the bed, taking off his shoes.

Señora Teresa’s snores echo through the walls.

Cleo picks up the teacup, intact and still full, and goes down the stairs.

INT - DOWNSTAIRS - TEPEJI 21 - NIGHT

Cleo goes down the stairs carrying the tea cup and when she reaches the hall, she goes into the living room to turn off all the lights. She leaves one on, next to the window.

She keeps going till she reaches the kitchen door. She walks in.

INT - KITCHEN - TEPEJI 21 - NIGHT

Cleo enters the kitchen, pours out the tea and rinses the cup. She turns off the light and goes out to the small patio, climbing the metal staircase to her room.

INT - MAID’S QUARTERS -TEPEJI 21 - NIGHT

Cleo walks into the room. Adela is already in her nightgown -

ADELA
You took forever!

Cleo takes off her dress, rushing.

CLEO
Turn the light off already! Señora Teresa gets angry if she sees the light on!

Adela shuts the light and the room is dark although the window is big and lets the moonlight in. Cleo lights a candle and puts it on the floor.
 
22.


CONTINUED:

The two of them lie down, lined up in such a way that one’s feet touch the other one’s feet and -

ADELA
Ready?

CLEO
Go...

The two of them push the upper parts of their bodies together and try to touch their toes -

ADELA
(groaning)

One...

And they work on their abs, one after the other -

ADELA (CONT’D)
(groaning)

Two...

Between grunts and groans.



Sunday, September 20th, 1970

EXT - INDEPENDENCIA AVE - DAY

The festive bustle of a Sunday in downtown Mexico City:
families and street vendors everywhere.

Cleo and Adela walk in step, hurrying down the sidewalk in a moving obstacle race.

Adela is faster but Cleo is more agile and tougher.

Adela takes the lead but runs into a bus stop with families getting off. Cleo manages to slip through the crowd and keeps going.

The sidewalk is a little less full, So Adela takes advantage of this and catches up just as they arrive to -

EXT - TORTA STAND - INDEPENDENCIA AVE - DAY

They stop, exhausted, catching their breath. One leans on a car, the other one on a lamp post.

Between deep breaths, Cleo lifts a hand, index pointing at the sky -
 
23.


CLEO
(breathless)

...I won...

ADELA
(breathless)

...No...we’re...tied...

Cleo simply shakes her head no.

INT - TORTA STAND - INDEPENDENCIA AVE - DAY

Hand-painted illustrations on the wall advertise the different kinds of tortas available. On the other wall, a mirror cut into diamond shapes reflects the already abundant clientele.

Cleo and Adela sit at the bar, enjoying their tortas cubanas, spilling over with each bite.

ADELA (CONT’D)
And then Moisés... remember Moisés, from the village?

Cleo nods, giving her torta a giant bite, overflowing with avocado.

ADELA (CONT’D)
So he was there, boom, boom, boom, and...

CLEO
(laughing)

Boom, boom...boom?

ADELA
No silly! Boom, boom, sending me

letter after letter...

Every time she speaks, Cleo puts her hand over her mouth -

CLEO
(curious)

What all was he writing about?

ADELA
Well, that he couldn’t stop thinking about me... about how much he missed me... wanted to see me...

CLEO
Aaaaaaayyyyyyy...!
 
24.


(CONT’D)

ADELA
That he felt so alone without me...

CLEO
Poor guy!

ADELA
That he couldn’t take not seeing me no more...

CLEO
Aaaaaaay...

ADELA
And so my cousin, he comes over
from the village to run some
errands and brings me another

letter from Moisés...

CLEO
And?

ADELA
And so he pulls out the letter and gives it to me... But the letter was there with a bunch of other letters, and as he’s pulling it out, they all spill onto the floor. And so I see one with Moisés’s handwriting, and so I just take it and I open it...!

Following the story, Cleo has stopped chewing -

ADELA (CONT’D)
And sure enough, it was Moisés’s. I can’t stop thinking about you... I want to see you.... I feel so alone without you... I miss you so...

CLEO
Pobrecito! Such a nice guy!

ADELA
Sure. Except the letter was for

another girl!

CLEO
Noooooo!

She’s floored, mouth wide open, a half-chewed piece of torta still in her mouth.
 
25.


CONTINUED:

ADELA
That bastard sends the same letter to all the girls!

The both explode in laughter, covering their mouths with their hands.

Other diners turn around and they both hide their faces, trying to repress their laughter.

AT THE ENTRANCE -

Two men walk into the torta stand and look around. They see Cleo and Adela sitting at the bar and walk towards them.

RAMÓN, 27, affable, a little overweight and with sideburns is wearing a purple shirt with four buttons open down the front.

FERMÍN, 26, is shy and a little sullen, with the sculpted body of an athlete over which he sports a t-shirt and a leather jacket.

RAMÓN
Why so alone eating your

tortitassssss...?

He startles the two women. Adela gets up immediately and -

ADELA
Ramón!

The two hug and kiss luxuriantly.

Fermín walks over with a shy smile. Cleo gets up and they awkwardly kiss hello.

ADELA (CONT’D)
You want a torta?

Timidly, Fermín points to his stomach -

FERMÍN
Thanks, I already...

RAMÓN
If you’re done eating, let’s go, I love watching the previews!

EXT - METROPOLITAN CINEMA - AFTERNOON
 
26.


The entrance to the movie theater is a bazar of STREET VENDORS hawking their wares, reciting lists over and over like a litany, like mantras in a chant.

And old woman seated on the floor offers her candies spread out on a piece of fabric in front of her -

CANDY VENDOR
...Cigarrettes-gum-chocolates-
mazipan-muéganos-peanuts-gum

drops...

Behind his makeshift table, another vendor offers “japanese” peanuts -

PEANUT VENDOR
Japaneeeeeeeeeeeeeeese peanuts!
Japaneeeeeeeeeeeeeeese peanuts!

Japaneeeeeeeeeeeeeeese peanuts!

A short, chubby lady walks around, a box of Adams gum in hand-

GUM VENDOR
One peso for Adams chewing gum!
Mint flavor, spearmint, cinnamon,

tuttifrutti...!

A meringue vendor, in his short shirt -

MERINGUE VENDOR
...Merengues-merengues-have a

delicious merengue!...

Magazine vendors, yo-yo and cheap toy vendors... a cacophony of cries accompanied by a barrell organ on the sidewalk.

Cleo, Adela, Ramón and Fermín line up at the ticket booth.

ADELA
What movie are we watching?

RAMÓN
Who knows.

Fermín asks Cleo -

FERMÍN
You sure you wanna go to the

movies...?

CLEO
Sure. I like movies, don’t you?
 
27.


CONTINUED:

FERMÍN
Well, I mean... it’s so nice out

this afternoon, isn’t it?

Cleo realizes the sun is shining and turns her had to the sky-

CLEO
Yep, sure is clear.

She looks at him -

CLEO (CONT’D)
You want to go to the Alameda?

Fermín smiles at her.

FERMÍN
Wait a sec...

He walks up to Ramón, who is at the top of the line, pulling money out of his wallet.

Adela takes the opportunity to go see Cleo.

ADELA
So, manita, no movies for you?

CLEO
Well... it’s so nice out, no?

ADELA
(interrupts)

Uuuuuuuuuuuuyyyyyy! Right... well, you’ll tell me all about it later, manita. I prefer the darkness.

And she walks off with Ramón who is waiting to go inside the theater. Fermín walks back to Cleo and they leave.

The street vendors continue their chorus. The organ player is quiet.



INT - HOTEL ROOM - AFTERNOON

The rules hang in a small frame over the door. Disregarded. Behind the window, the Sunday afternoon wanes and a fluorescent sign peeks in, advertising the hotel.
 
28.


Behind the open bathroom door, a single bulb lights the sink and a rusty mirror. Fermín exits the bathroom carrying a pair of nunchaku. He’s completely naked.

Cleo waits in bed timidly, her slip still on. She blushes as she sees Fermín. In front of the bathroom, Fermín presents his nunchaku -

FERMÍN
Jodan Tsuki!...

He begins his nunchaku routine. It’s an elaborate and studied choreography, the chained up sticks spinning like helixes around him.

The effect is both poetic and a little ridiculous, but Cleo hides her smile behind the sheets.

Fermín finalizes his routine by striking different positions -

FERMÍN (CONT’D)
Jodan Tsuki! Chudan Tsuki! Mae

Geri!

And he bows. Cleo represses a laugh.

FERMÍN (CONT’D)
What?

Cleo covers her smile, asking -

CLEO
So, do you train every day?

FERMÍN
I have to. I owe my life to martial arts. I grew up with nothing, you know?

Outside, the crowd’s hustle and bustle seems distant. Fermín leaves the nunchaku on a shelf and walks towards the foot of the bed -

FERMÍN (CONT’D)
When I was a kid and my ma died...

He crosses himself -

FERMÍN (CONT’D)
My aunt took me in... Over there in Neza. And between my cousins who beat me up and the bad influences, I started drinking...and then huffing...I was dying...
 
29.


CONTINUED:

He pauses -

FERMÍN (CONT’D)
But then I found out about martial arts. And so then those things...
well, you know, suddenly everything seemed, well... focused?

Fermín pauses for a beat, looks at Cleo -

FERMÍN (CONT’D)
I don’t really like telling people about my stuff, but with you it’s... different.

He pulls his face close to hers and their lips meet and kiss, softly. But soon Cleo moves her head, bumping Fermín on the nose.

CLEO
Oh! Sorry...!

Fermín pulls her in again and kisses her intensely and with his mouth locked on Cleo’s he lies down slowly on top of her.

They make love.



Wednesday, November 11th, 1970.

INT- MAID’S QUARTERS - TEPEJI 21 - DAWN

The alarm bell rings. Cleo wakes up and turns it off. She sits up on her bed.

The early morning light comes in the window and the house is quiet. Adela sleeps placidly in her bed.

Cleo gets up in a rush, takes her clothes from the chair, puts on her shoes and hurries out the door.



EXT - SMALL PATIO - TEPEJI 21 - DAWN

Cleo rushes down the stairs and into the small bathroom.
 



INT - MAID’S BATHROOM - TEPEJI 21 - DAWN
 
30.


Cleo vomits.

The bathroom is clean but has had zero upkeep for a long time. The tiny shower is curtainless and the toilet has no seat and no lid on the water tank.

In the sink, two toothbrushes and a squeezed tube of Colgate.
On a small shelf, a jar of Nivea and an unlit votive candle.

INT - MAID’S BATHROOM - TEPEJI 21 - MOMENTS LATER

Cleo takes a shower, the tiny bathroom immediately clouding with steam.


INT - DOWNSTAIRS - TEPEJI 21 - DAWN

Cleo comes out of the kitchen and walks across the house, still in gloom although behind the patio windows the first light of day is already warming.

Cleo reaches the stairs and walks up.

INT - UPSTAIRS HALL - TEPEJI 21 - DAY

Through the younger children’s bedroom door, we can see Cleo whispering to Sofi -

CLEO
My little girl... my beautiful

little one...

She tickles her midriff -

CLEO (CONT’D)
Rise and shine... wake up, wake
up... it’s a new dawn, it’s a new

day...

The tickling inches up Sofi’s torso like an army of ants.
Sofi smiles but pretends to sleep.

CLEO (CONT’D)
Up, up, up little by little...

Sofi finally breaks into laughter and drowsily moves her arms.

CLEO (CONT’D)
Good morning, my little princess...

Sofi hugs her neck.
 
31.


CLEO (CONT’D)
Andali! Get up...

Sofi gets up -

SOFI
Bathroom...

CLEO
Get going already!

Sofi leaves the room and crosses the hall sleepily while Cleo places a clean school uniform on the bed.

Señora Teresa walks out of her bedroom and sees Sofi about to enter the bathroom -

SEÑORA TERESA
Good morning, Sofi.

Sofi goes in without turning back -

SOFI
Good morning, grandma...

She closes the door. Señora Teresa walks down the stairs.

Cleo goes to Pepe’s bed and gives him a quick kiss, making sure not to wake him, then leaves the room.

She turns the light on in the hall and goes to Toño and Paco’s room. They’re deep asleep.

She crouches down next to Toño, caressing his head and whispering -

CLEO
Toño, Toño my love, it’s time to

wake up...

Without even turning around, Toño slaps her hand off -

TOÑO
I’m up...

Cleo puts her hands up in the air -

CLEO
Oh, so he’s already awake! Oh, so

no one should touch him!...

Toño gets up, grouchy, and leaves the room.
 
32.


CONTINUED:

CLEO (CONT’D)
Sofi’s in the bathroom...

In the hall, he knocks on the bathroom door -

SOFI (O.C.)
Busy!

Toño knocks louder.

TOÑO
Hurry up! I gotta go!

SOFI (O.C.)
Coming!

Cleo sits at the foot of Paco’s bed and pulls one of his feet out of the covers and puts his socks on without waking him. She sits him up, leans him against her, and takes off the top of his pajamas.

In the hall, Toño keeps knocking on the bathroom door -

TOÑO
Get out!

The bathroom door opens, and Sofi comes out -

SOFI
You can go in now!

Toño walks in straight away and as he closes the door -

TOÑO
Fatty...!

Sofi walks back into her bedroom.

Cleo has managed to put Paco’s t-shirt on. He’s now sitting on the bed.
