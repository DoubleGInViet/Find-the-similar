CLEO
Come on, finish getting dressed.

Paco takes off his pajama pants and Cleo walks out to the hall and in to help Sofi.

INT - BREAKFAST ROOM - TEPEJI 21 - DAY

Señora Teresa and Sofi have breakfast at the table. Cleo is putting away waxed paper packages into the backpacks on the floor next to each chair.
 
33.


Through the windows, Ignacio is taking the cars out to the street.

A portable radio on the table plays XEQK HASTE’S OBSERVATORY HOUR -

HASTE HOUR
Chocolates Turín! Ricos de principio a fin! Maestro Mecánico Marcos Carrasco garantiza vigoroso control de calidad en la rectificación de motores... (Turin Chocolates! Delicious from beginning to end! Mechanic Marcos Carrasco guarantees quality control when rectifying motors...)

Paco comes out of the kitchen with a Gansito and puts it in his backpack, except Sofi sees him -

SOFI
I want a Gansito too!

PACO
They’re mine.

SEÑORA TERESA
I bought them for everyone.

PACO
But I put them in the freezer.

SEÑORA TERESA
Come on, give one to Sofi and I’ll buy you a big box just for you.

Paco weighs the offer and goes back into the kitchen.

Señora Teresa has finished her pan dulce dunked in coffee with milk and gets up.

SEÑORA TERESA (CONT’D)
Hurry up kids, it’s seven twenty

already.

Paco’s voice pipes in from the kitchen -

PACO (O.C.)
It’s seven seventeen!

The Haste Hour recites -
 
34.


HASTE HOUR
XEQK proporciona la hora del observatorio, misma de Haste. Haste, la Hora de México. Siete de la mañana diecisiete minutos. Siete diecisiete... (a beat)... BIIIP (XEQK gives you the time at the observatory, same as Haste’s. Haste, Mexico’s time. Seven in the morning and seventeen minutes. Seven seventeen...)

Paco triumphantly exits the kitchen. Señora Teresa pulls out her tongue at him and walks off to the door. Paco throws Sofi her Gansito.

PACO
For you to get fatter...

Toño walks in.

CLEO
Your juice, Toño.

Toño sits down -

TOÑO
Turn that thing off.

PACO
No, why?

Señora Teresa is already calling them from the door -

SEÑORA TERESA
Let’s go!

Sofi gets up and walks towards Señora Teresa who is heading out towards the patio -

SEÑORA TERESA (CONT’D)
Cleo, hold the dog so I can open

the door.

Cleo immediately gets up and runs out to the patio.

Toño also gets up and turns the radio volume all the way up before leaving.

Paco turns it off with a slap -

TOÑO
Haha! Sissy!
 
35.


CONTINUED:

Before reaching the patio, Paco cries out -

PACO
Shotgun!

Toño downs his juice and follows them.



EXT - HOUSE -TEPEJI 21 - DAY

The Valiant is parked in front of the house, engine idling, Haste Hour on the radio.

Cleo waits on the sidewalk, holding Borras from the collar, while Señora Teresa and the kids scramble messily into the car.

TOÑO
Move it!

SOFI
I’m moving!

When Señora Teresa has managed to get in the car, Ignacio closes the door behind her, waiting for everyone else to close their doors before getting in.

TOÑO
Put La Pantera on!

Paco turns the dial and the radio station switches to La Pantera right in the middle of a Beetles vs. Creedence vote -

RADIO LA PANTERA
...Por quién votas campeón? Por los
Beatles... Un voto más para el

Creedence... (Who do you vote for,
champ? For the Beatles... One more

trailing 18 votes behind the Bajou
quartet. Who do you vote for?

Creedence...)

Ignacio steps on the clutch letting Paco, who is sitting next to him, put the hand gear next to the steering wheel in first.
 
36.


The Valiant drives off and down the street. Cleo sees it turn the corner and she walks back into the house pulling the dog inside. She closes the door.

INT - DOWNSTAIRS HALL - TEPEJI 21 -DAY

Cleo comes in, closing the patio door. She crosses the hall and walks up the stairs.

INT - SOFI AND PEPE’S ROOM - TEPEJI 21 - DAY

Cleo hides her face in Pepe’s belly. He laughs.

PEPE
I was already up!

CLEO
Oh goody! So you’re already

dressed!

PEPE
Not yet.

CLEO
C’mon! Get up, let’s get you

dressed!

Pepe gets up and Cleo dresses him while he talks -

PEPE
You know what I remembered in my

dream?

CLEO
No, what did you remember?

PEPE
I remembered when I was older.

CLEO
When you were older?

PEPE
Yes, you were also there, but you

were different. Do you remember?

Cleo pulls his shorts up.

INT - BREAKFAST ROOM - TEPEJI 21 - DAY

A spoon delicately taps on the dome of an egg, cracking it slowly.

Cleo takes off the shell and empties out the soft-boiled egg onto a cup. She puts in salt and little bits of bread.

She gives Pepe the cup. He eats. Cleo gets up and takes the dirty dishes into the -

INT - KITCHEN - TEPEJI 21 - DAY

Cleo comes in at the same time as Adela, her hair wet, through the small patio door.

CLEO
Good night!

ADELA
Why didn’t you wake me?

CLEO
Well, God forbid you get tired

later.

Adela looks at her with a crooked smile. Cleo spreads marmalade on a piece of bread and places it on another.

They hear Señora Sofía walk into the Breakfast Room -

PEPE (O.S.)
Mom!

SEÑORA SOFÍA (O.S.)
How’s your egg, my love?

Cleo puts the sandwich in a wax paper baggie -

CLEO
The Doctor is leaving. Tie Borras

up so he can go.

Cleo takes the sandwich and a glass of orange juice and heads to the breakfast room. Adela goes out to the patio.

INT - BREAKFAST ROOM - TEPEJI 21 - DAY

Señora Sofía is sitting next to Pepe, Cleo comes in with the juice.

CLEO (CONT’D)

SEÑORA SOFÍA
Pepe can wait to say goodbye to his dad. It doesn’t matter if he’s late.

CLEO
Yes ma’m.

At the back of the hall, Señor Antonio has come down the stairs, carrying two bags. Cleo rushes to help him.

CLEO (CONT’D)
Leave them there, please, sir...!

Señor Antonio leaves the bags on the floor.

SEÑOR ANTONIO
Thanks, Cleo.

He walks to the Breakfast Room -

SEÑOR ANTONIO (CONT’D)
Good morning, Pepón!

PEPE
Daddy!

Señor Antonio gulps down the whole glass of orange juice.

Cleo heads over to the luggage: she carries the bags and exits -

EXT - PATIO - TEPEJI 21 - DAY

Military drums and trumpets echo inside the patio. Cleo carries the bags to the door where Adela is holding Borras by the collar. Cleo pauses only to open the door and walks out to -

EXT - HOUSE - TEPEJI 21 - DAY

A Jr. High marching band marks each step as they file down the street, sounding drums and trumpets.

A 1966 cream colored VW SEDAN waits in front of the house.

Cleo walks out with the bags and leaves them next to the car. She opens the door and puts one bag in the rear seat then opens the mechanism in the glove compartment.
 
39.


She gets out of the car and carries the second bag to the front of the car, opens the trunk and puts it in the tiny space.

She walks back into the house but sees Señor Antonio already walking out through the patio. Señora Sofía follows him, carrying Pepe.

Señor Antonio steps on dog shit and stops, disgusted -

SEÑOR ANTONIO
Well I’ll be...

He rubs the foot on the floor trying to clean it off and keeps walking. On the street, he scrapes the sole of his shoe against the edge of the sidewalk.

Señora Sofía puts Pepe down on the as they reach the street and walks over to Señor Antonio, hugging him from the back.

Cleo moves back a few steps, Pepe walks over to her and holds her hand.

Señora Sofía starts crying. Señor Antonio turns around and hugs her, uncomfortable.

SEÑORA SOFÍA
We’ll be here...

SEÑOR ANTONIO
It’s just for a few weeks...

He disentangles from Señora Sofía who heads over to give him a snotty kiss which he accepts before sitting at the wheel and closing the door.

Señora Sofía puts her hand on her husband’s shoulder while he turns on his four cylinder engine.

SEÑOR ANTONIO (CONT’D)
Bye, Pepe...

He shifts into first gear and starts off slowly, forcing Señora Sofía to lift her hand, then drives off to the end of the street.

The VW idles at the corner where it waits for the back of the marching band to leave the street taking its martial airs with it, then disappears to the right.

Señora Sofía is frozen, her hand held up in the air. Cleo waits.
 
40.


CONTINUED:

Finally, Señora Sofía turns, her face upset -

SEÑORA SOFÍA
Goddamnit! Clean up that dog shit!

She walks up to Pepe and takes his hand -

SEÑORA SOFÍA (CONT’D)
I’ll take Pepe.

She walks with Pepe to the end of the street, heading in the opposite direction as Señor Antonio.

Cleo comes into the house and closes the door.

EXT - PATIO -TEPEJI 21 - DAY

Cleo pushes the shit onto a dustpan with a broom.

She moves on to the next one, while Borras walks around the patio, oblivious.

One by one, she picks them all up.

EXT - SMALL PATIO - TEPEJI 21 - DAY

Cleo opens the trash and throws in the shit. She closes it.

EXT - PATIO - TEPEJI 21 - DAY

A smeared stain on a red and white tile is all that remains of Borras’s shit. Pale dust falls on the stain until it’s entirely covered.

Cleo crosses the patio, dusting soap on each one of the remaining stains. She reaches the street entrance, fills two pails of water, pours them on the floor and -

One by one, she brushes every single dusted stain in the patio.

MOVIE
 
41.


The theater is almost full, but emptier towards the back. In the last row, Cleo and Fermín sit next to each other, making out intensely, their hands rubbing each other’s genitals while they kiss.

FERMÍN
Suck it...

Cleo moves back briefly and tries to tell him between sighs -

CLEO
It’s just that... I haven’t gotten my period this month...

But she succumbs, trying to repress a groan of pleasure. She kisses and caresses Fermín with greater intensity as he explores her more deeply with his hand.

MOVIE

Finally, Cleo manages to overcome her desire to tell him -

CLEO (CONT’D)
I’m telling you. I haven’t had my

period all month.

But Fermín quiets her with a kiss on the mouth. When he goes to her neck, Cleo tries to talk between convulsions of pleasure -

CLEO (CONT’D)
I think I‘m with child.

Fermín pauses briefly, then keeps kissing her -

FERMÍN
Oooohhh, well that’s OK, right?

CLEO
That’s OK?

FERMÍN
Yeah...

Cleo smiles and kisses him on the mouth. She lowers her head and gives him a blow job. Fermín holds her head down pushing her to a rhythm.

FERMÍN (CONT’D)
Like that... Just. Like. That...

MOVIE
 
42.


CONTINUED:

Fermín reaches his arms out to grab onto the backs of the neighboring seats and starts moaning.

FERMÍN (CONT’D)
Yes, yeeeeees, yeeeeeeeees,

yeeeeeeeeeeeeees!

He opens his mouth and muffles a cry by biting down on his hand and when the explosion is over, Cleo comes up, hand on her mouth, face splashed with semen.

She opens her purse and pulls out a couple of Kleenex. She wipes her mouth and face, then her hands, and cuddles on Fermín who is still breathing heavily. The two watch the movie. Cleo is in love.

MOVIE

Fermín moves softly to get up -

FERMÍN (CONT’D)
I have to go to the restroom...

CLEO
Shhhh... It’s almost over.

FERMÍN
I gotta go now. Gimme a sec, I’ll

be right back...

He gets up, walking through the empty seats to the aisle and then to the exit.

Cleo waits till he’s left to look for some gum in her purse. She puts it in her mouth. Pulls out another Kleenex, wets it with her tongue and wipes her face.

The MOVIE reaches the end and the CREDITS roll. Cleo looks to the exit.

PEOPLE start to leave.

The LIGHTS COME ON in the theater, SECTION BY SECTION, SLOWLY...

Cleo gets up and looks to the exits, leaning onto the seats in front of her.

Credits keep rolling with the names of the Stage Crew.

The theater is now empty except for Cleo and the screen showing the sound credits.

The velvet curtain closes, interrupting the unfinished credits.

Cleo finally heads to the exit.


INT - LOBBY METRPOLITAN CINEMA - AFTERNOON

New spectators enter the theater, some heading directly to the candy store, where the lines are still short.

Cleo wanders through the lobby looking for Fermín but there’s no sign of him.

She walks towards the entrance, heading the opposite direction as the newcomers.

EXT -ENTRANCE -METROPOLITAN CINEMA - AFTERNOON

Cleo exits and walks to the middle of the entrance where she stops, engrossed between the STREET VENDORS hawking their wares, reciting their different mantras.

Her legs seem to fall out from under her and she leans on the marquee advertising the upcoming releases. Slowly, she sits on the ground between -

An old lady selling her sweets

SWEETS VENDOR

And a man peddling his magic trick: a small plastic skeleton that dances on the ground -

SKELETON VENDOR
No tricks, no ruses, it dances on
its own! No strings, no cheating,

Cleo stays still in the midst of a sea of voices -

Aha! Mister Carlangas is resting!

EXT -STREET - DAY

And old Purépecha indigenous man, hunched and with a straw hat carries an enormous and bulky cloth sack, which almost covers his frail figure from the back.

He walks down the street at a steady step, stopping only to rearrange the heavy sack on his back.

He walks past a convenience store, a pharmacy, a bakery, a dime store, a stationary store and turns onto -

EXT - TEPEJI STREET - HOUSE - TEPEJI 21 - DAY

Without losing his rhythm, the old man walks in front of the old houses built in the 1930s, hunched over, the enormous bulk resting almost vertically on his back. Some houses have renovated, some are in desperate need of a new coat of paint.

He arrives to Tepeji 21 and stops in front of the door. Slowly he takes the giant load off his back and puts it on the ground. He rings the bell.

Inside, we hear Borras running to the door, barking furiously. The old man waits.

Borras doesn’t let up, his barks grow ever louder. Cleo approaches -

CLEO (O.S.)
Who is it?
 
45.


OLD MAN WITH ORANGES
Oranges!

Borras answers, furious.

CLEO (O.S.)
Coming...! Borras, shut up!

The old man picks up the sack while the door opens just enough for Cleo to peek out while grabbing the dog’s collar.

The old man finishes putting his sack back up on his back -

OLD MAN WITH ORANGES
You got the dog?

CLEO
Yes.

OLD MAN WITH ORANGES
You sure?

CLEO
I got him. Come on in.

The door opens and Borras immediately lunges for the old man, but Cleo holds tugs at collar with all her strength. The dog barks, aggressive, standing on its hind legs.

The old man comes into -

EXT -PATIO -TEPEJI 21 - DAY

Cleo holds Borras and steps to the side while the old man comes in. The dog’s mouth sprays slob with each bark.

OLD MAN WITH ORANGES
Hold him tight.

Cleo wrestles with the dog -

CLEO
Come in, come in...

The old man walks cautiously next to Cleo, who is still holding Borras. She closes the door and follows in after him, keeping her distance. At the far end of the patio, the old man goes into the -

EXT - SMALL PATIO - TEPEJI 21 - DAY

The old man stops in front the kitchen and slowly deposits the heavy sack on the floor. Adela comes out of the kitchen carrying a wooden crate, which she places on the floor -

CONTINUED:

ADELA
Good morning, sir...

OLD MAN WITH ORANGES
Morning... How many’ll it be?

ADELA
Thirty.

The old man takes his hat off to cool his straight white hair damp with sweat. His Indigenous face is furrowed by deep wrinkles. He bends over, puts his hands in the sack and pulls out -

OLD MAN WITH ORANGES
1...2...3...4...5...6...

Cleo holds Borras who won’t stop barking.

EXT - PATIO - TEPEJI 21 - AFTERNOON

Pebbles of ice bounce off the ground after falling from the sky. Hail covers the patio.

INT - KITCHEN - TEPEJI 21 -AFTERNOON

Drowned out by clouds, the afternoon light fights to pierce through the windows. Behind the window: hail over the small patio.

Adela pours coffee in a pot and puts it on a tray that already has a sugar bowl, a little milk pitcher, a spoon and a napkin. Next to her, Cleo waits nervously.

ADELA
C’mon manita, you take it.

Cleo takes the platter and walks towards the living room.
Adela walks with her but stops at the door.

INT - LIVING ROOM - TEPEJI 21 - AFTERNOON

Cleo exits the kitchen. Adela waits next to the door and watches her cross the hall carrying the coffee tray. Behind the windows, hail pours down.

The afternoon light barely mottles the living room curtains and already some lamps are on. In a corner, a Christmas Tree shows off its many colored lights over a handcrafted nativity scene with moss, hay and cardboard landscapes.
 
47.


CONTINUED:

In the modern living room, the children sit at the sofa around Señora Sofía.

Cleo places the platter on the coffee table next to some sheets of paper and envelopes and pours the coffee. She is about to add some cream, when -

SEÑORA SOFÍA
That’ll be fine, Cleo...

Cleo places the cup in front of Señora Sofía. She takes the cream and pours it while Cleo starts to leave. She stops -

CLEO
Pardon me, Señora Sofi?

Señora Sofía adds two sugars to her coffee.

SEÑORA SOFÍA
Yes?

CLEO
It’s just that... when you have a
minute, would you mind if we talk

for a little bit?

SEÑORA SOFÍA
Yes, just wait a sec. I need to say something to the children.

Cleo nods and steps back a few steps, ready to wait.

SEÑORA SOFÍA (CONT’D) Feel free to sit down and wait over here.

Cleo timidly sits on the sofa. Señora Sofía tastes her coffee, the children grow restless.

PACO
What?

TOÑO
I gotta go buy balsa wood to build a model.

Señora Sofía sips her coffee and good-humoredly says -

SEÑORA SOFÍA
You’ll go later. There’s something

I want to tell you...

PACO
Are we going to Disneyland?

SEÑORA SOFÍA
No, we’re spending Christmas at my brother Pablo’s.

PACO
It’s so boring there!

SOFI
Not true! My cousins are there!

SEÑORA SOFÍA
And for New Year’s we’ll go to the

Zavaleta’s hacienda.

PACO
Will the Richards be there?

SEÑORA SOFÍA
Yes and the Matos and the Larsons.

TOÑO
When’s dad coming?

SEÑORA SOFÍA
That’s the other thing I wanted to talk to you about. His research is delayed and he’ll have to stay in Quebec a little longer.

TOÑO
Will he be back by January?

Señora Sofía pauses for the briefest instant and when she takes up the conversation again her tone seems to have changed.

SEÑORA SOFÍA
He doesn’t know. But that’s why I
brought you the paper. So you can

each write him a letter.

She hands out the paper and envelopes to the children -

SEÑORA SOFÍA (CONT’D) Tell him how much you miss him, to come back soon please...

Her good humor masks her nervousness.
 
49.


CONTINUED:

SEÑORA SOFÍA (CONT’D)
Pepe, you draw him somthing...

PEPE
I know how to write too.

PACO
Sure...

Toño gets up -

TOÑO
Well, first I’m going to go get my balsa wood.

Señor Sofía yells at him -

SEÑORA SOFÍA
You’re not going anywhere until
you’ve finished writing your

letter!

Toño grabs his papers and rushes off angrily towards the stairs.

SEÑORA SOFÍA (CONT’D)
Where are you going?

TOÑO
To my room. What? Can’t I write the letter in my room either?

SEÑORA SOFÍA
Sure, that’s fine.

Paco grabs his paper and follows Toño -

PACO
I’m going up too.

Señora Sofía gives the rest of the paper to Sofi.

SEÑORA SOFÍA
Sofi, take this to the dining room and help Pepe with his letter. Let me just talk to Cleo for a minute and I’ll come join you.

Sofi takes the papers -

SOFI
C’mon Pepe.
 
50.


CONTINUED:

SEÑORA SOFÍA
Make lots of pretty drawings, Pepe. Sofi, help him write “I miss you a lot, daddy.”

SOFI
Sure. Let’s go Pepe.

Sofi and Pepe go off with their papers to the dining room table.

PEPE
But I’ll write it, OK?

Señora Sofía watches the kids trail off into the dining room.
She turns to Cleo.

SEÑORA SOFÍA
OK, Cleo. What do you need?

Cleo looks at her like a deer in the headlights. She can’t speak.

SEÑORA SOFÍA (CONT’D)
Didn’t you want to tell me

something?

CLEO
No, well, yes. It’s just that...

But her words fail her. In the back, next to the kitchen door, Adela pretends to clean while she tries to listen -

SEÑORA SOFÍA
Yes?

Cleo’s eyes fill with tears. Señora Sofía worries -

SEÑORA SOFÍA (CONT’D)
What’s wrong, Cleo?

Cleo just sobs.

SEÑORA SOFÍA (CONT’D)
Is your mother all right?

Cleo nods -

CLEO
It’s just that... Señora Sofi...
 
51.


SEÑORA SOFÍA
Yes?

CLEO
It’s just that... I think I’m

expecting.

Señora Sofía wasn’t expecting this at all -

SEÑORA SOFÍA
What do you mean, you think?

CLEO
It’s just that I haven’t gotten my period.

SEÑORA SOFÍA
Since when?

CLEO
I don’t know...

She starts sobbing. Señora Sofía sits next to her and hugs her.

SEÑORA SOFÍA
Oh you silly, silly girl. And who

is the dad?

CLEO
Fermín. Adela’s boyfriend’s cousin.

SEÑORA SOFÍA
Does he know?

Cleo shakes her head -

CLEO
He’s disappeared.

SEÑORA SOFÍA
Silly, silly, silly...!

CLEO
You’re going to fire me, aren’t

you?

SEÑORA SOFÍA
What do you mean fire you? We have to take you to the doctor to get checked.

Pepe comes in with his letter -

PEPE
Look, ma. I drew a plane.

SEÑORA SOFÍA
Very good. Now put some hearts on
it...
(Calling out to Sofi)
Sofi! I told you to help your

brother write “I miss you.”

Sofi answers from the dining room -

SOFI
He won’t let me help him!

PEPE
Why is Cleo crying?

SEÑORA SOFÍA
For no reason. She’s got a
stomachache. Let’s see, come over

here. Let’s write your letter.

Señora Sofía walks over to the dining room but Pepe walks up to Cleo and hugs her. He rubs her belly -

PEPE
Sana, sana colita de rana. Si no
sanas hoy, sanarás mañana...

(Nursery rhyme to heal boo-boos)

Cleo laughs and hugs Pepe, hiding her tears.

INT/EXT - GALAXIE 500 - BAJA CALIFORNIA AVE - DAY

Señora Sofía drives silently, hands on the stirring wheel, but her index fingers moves as if acquiescing at the intense argument going on in her head.

Cleo rides next to her. Hair freshly done. She’s changed her dress. She is nervous.

They come to a cross-street where cars wait for the green light. Señora Sofía tries to squeeze into the space between a moving truck and an old jalopy.

Impossible. The inevitable happens. The Galaxie 500 scrapes on both sides, but this doesn’t seem to bother Señora Sofía who keeps inching up slowly, despite the crush of twisting metal -

SEÑORA SOFÍA (CONT’D)
Pío, pío, pío, pío...

EXT - BAJA CALIFORNIA AVE - DAY

The Galaxie 500 moves forward between the truck and the jalopy, scraping its moldings, twisting them, and ripping off the side mirror to boot.

The Galaxie lurches on amidst the crush of metal sheets until the space is too tight to keep going.

The light changes to green and they drive on, except for the truck and the jalopy whose irritated drivers exit their vehicles to assess the damage.

The modern building site glows proudly with its promise of progress.

The Galaxie 500, with its dented sides and dragging a molding enters a parking lot reserved for the doctors.

SEÑORA SOFÍA
It’s Doctor Roldán’s wife.

The nurse picks up a phone.

Wall to wall picture windows run all along the hallway and the exam rooms.

Señora Sofía waits with Cleo, who looks out the window onto the city stretching out to the west.

DOCTOR VÉLEZ walks in with all the conviction that comes with experience. She is 40 years old and wears glasses.

SEÑORA SOFÍA
Hello, Margarita. Thank you for

seeing us.

DOCTORA VÉLEZ
Of course, Sofía. With pleasure.

They kiss hello.

SEÑORA SOFÍA
Remember Cleo?

Doctor Vélez turns to Cleo -

DOCTORA VÉLEZ
Of course! Hi Cleo, how are you?

Cleo suffers from a mix of shyness and fear.

CLEO
Fine, thank you, doctor.

DOCTORA VÉLEZ

Cleo.

DOCTORA VéLEZ (CONT'D) Come with me and tell me all about it... Sofía, you want to come as well?

DOCTORA VÉLEZ
Well, Cleo and I are going to have a chat. Why don’t we meet in the lobby in forty minutes or so?

SEÑORA SOFÍA
Sure. I’ll be back then.

She holds Cleo’s hand -

Go on Cleo, go with the doctor.

She walks back to the lobby. Cleo and Doctor Vélez head to one of the exam rooms.

INT - EXAM ROOM - OB/GYN - DAY

Cleo is sitting in a gynecological chair. She looks at the instruments on a tray off to the side. They look like medieval torture instruments.

The door opens and Doctor Vélez comes in. She sits on a chair between Cleo’s legs and starts to put on latex gloves -

DOCTORA VÉLEZ
All right then. Cleo, tell me.

Cleo hesitates -		
CLEO	That...	
It’s just that....		

DOCTORA VÉLEZ
It’s OK Cleo, you can talk to me...

CLEO
It’s that I haven’t gotten my

period.

DOCTORA VÉLEZ
Since when?

CLEO
About two months maybe?
 
56.


DOCTORA VÉLEZ
OK. And you’ve been sexually active for how long?

Cleo blushes and cannot bring herself to answer.

DOCTORA VÉLEZ (CONT’D)
Have you had many partners?

CLEO
Oh no! Never!

DOCTORA VÉLEZ
Do you use protection?

Cleo apparently doesn’t understand the question.

DOCTORA VÉLEZ (CONT’D)
Do you use condoms?

Cleo’s tears are the only answer. Doctor takes the speculum and smears Vaseline on it.

DOCTORA VÉLEZ (CONT’D)
When was the last time you got

checked?

CLEO
Probably three or four years ago

when I came to see you.

DOCTORA VÉLEZ
That’s not good, Cleo. You have to get checked twice a year.

CLEO
Yes, doctor.

DOCTORA VÉLEZ
Well, let’s see how you’re doing.
This is going to feel a little

cold...

Doctor Vélez slides the speculum in between Cleo’s legs.
Cleo’s face confirms it’s not only cold, it’s also painful.

When she sees Cleo, Señora Sofía interrupts her chat with Doctor Zavala. Cleo is crying and is still disturbed.

Doctor Vélez and Doctor Zavala kiss hello -

DOCTORA VÉLEZ
Hi, Mario...

DOCTOR ZAVALA
Doctoress...

SEÑORA SOFÍA
How’s Cleo doing?

DOCTORA VÉLEZ
Cleo is ten weeks pregnant. She’s very healthy and very strong and so is her baby. One thing: she has to get an iron shot every two weeks. I’ve given her a prescription.

SEÑORA SOFÍA
When’s she due?

DOCTORA VÉLEZ
Sometime around the end of June.

SEÑORA SOFÍA
Oh Margarita, thank you so much for seeing her.

DOCTORA VÉLEZ
It’s nothing! I missed her, right

Cleo? OK, I’m off...

She kisses Señora Sofía goodbye -

DOCTORA VÉLEZ (CONT’D)
Bye, Cleo. See you next month for

your check up.

CLEO
Yes, doctor. Thank you.

Doctora Vélez walks off down the hallway. Señora Sofía turns to see Cleo -

SEÑORA SOFÍA
Cleo, why don’t you go down to the third floor to see the new-born babies while I finish up here with Doctor Zavala?
 
58.


INT. - MATERNITY WARD - OB/GYN - DAY

Dozens of cribs in a row, each one with its own new-born baby rolled up in a blanket.

Cleo watches them through the window.

Some sleep and others cry anxiously.

Four cribs project strong lights on babies with masks, and to one side -

In an INCUBATOR -

A premature baby, tiny and fragile is plugged into tubes that barely bind him to life.

Cleo watches, fascinated. Suddenly -

A great block of plaster falls off the ceiling and lands on the incubator, covering it completely.

INT/EXT - ‘64 VALIANT - PUEBLA FREEWAY EXIT - CERRO LA CALDERA - DAY

Señora Sofía drives, her index finger in its eternal argument. Cleo rides next to her, and between them, Pepe. Toño, Paco and Sofi are in the back seat. The radio plays Radio Éxitos.

Pepe looks through the rearview mirror off into the distance -

PEPE
Why does the mountain spell LEA?

(READ)

SEÑORA SOFÍA
So that you kids read. See? Even

the mountain is asking.

TOÑO
It’s the initials for Luis

Echeverría Álvarez, dummy.

SEÑORA SOFÍA
Don’t call him that. He’s 5. He doesn’t have to know who Echeverría is. Explain it to him.
 
59.


CONTINUED:

TOÑO
He’s the president!

SOFI
Isn’t it Gustavo Díaz Ordaz?

SEÑORA SOFÍA
Not anymore, Sofi. It’s now Luis

Echeverría, since December 1st.

SOFI
Oooooh...

PACO
Cleo really likes Echeverría. Yuck!

CLEO
Well, yeah. His wife Doña Ester is always dressed in huipiles and Oaxacan clothing. He likes us Indians.

TOÑO
But my uncle Alberto says he’s the one who ordered the students killed two years ago.

CLEO
Noooooo!

TOÑO
He was the Minister of the

Interior.

SOFI
Why did he kill the students?

TOÑO
‘Cause they didn’t do their

homework.

SEÑORA SOFÍA
Enough, Toño. No, Sofi, Toño is

just messing with you.

PEPE
Well I don’t like him. Why does he write on the mountain? It’s not his!
 
60.


EXT. - PUEBLA FREEWAY - CERRO LA CALDERA - DAY

The Valiant plows on eastward. In the background the Cerro La Caldera, longing to be a mountain, delineates the boundary of the city as it melts into the slums.

The west slope of the hill has been desecrated by three immense white letters extending almost all along and across its dry surface - LEA.

Like a curse.


EXT. - ZAVALETA HACIENDA - DAY

A great adobe wall surrounds an immense property in the middle of fields. The Valiant crosses an enormous gate into-

EXT. - ENTRANCE - ZAVALETA HACIENDA - DAY

A road crosses the enormous walled esplanade. In the background, the beautiful wall of the hacienda, a monument to Profirian estates.

The Valiant reaches the Big House. A dozen cars are parked in a row to one side of the road. All large luxury cars of the year: LTDs, Impalas and Country Squires.

The ‘64 Valiant parks between an LTD and a Country Squire, making its mileage and its peeling paint very obvious. They get out of the car.

Señora Sofía opens the trunk and Cleo starts to pull out the luggage, her belly barely noticeable.

A group of people comes out of the Big House to greet them: three adults, some kids and several servants. CLAUDIA DE LA BÁRCENA, 38, SAMANTHA LARSSON, also 38, a high-class Mexican with died blond hair and MOLLY EDWARDS, an affable blond Welsh woman, 37, all throw their arms up in the air -

MOLLY
Comadre!


EXT/INT - CORRIDOR - HACIENDA - DAY

BENITA, 55 years old, the Hacienda housekeeper, guides Cleo down a long corridor. Both carry several bags some in their hands others hanging from their shoulders.

BENITA
You sure you can carry that?
 
61.


CONTINUED:

CLEO
Yes, I’m with child, not sick.

What? You tired already?

Cleo hurries forward. Benita does the same, following her.

BENITA
As if!

CLEO
I haven’t seen you for six months

and you got old on me.

The two women race hurriedly, buried under bags like ants carrying several times their own weight.

Benita catches up with Cleo, who hurries on and overtakes her. But Benita stops -

BENITA
Where you going?

Cleo stops. Benita is standing next to a door -



BENITA (CONT’D)
You’ve gone too far. What? Since
you’re pregnant you forget

everything?

Cleo smiles and walks back.


INT. - CHILDREN’S ROOM - HACIENDA - DAY

A hall full of bunk beds, rudimentary but functional. There are several bags next to the beds and there are toys on top of some already.

Lined up along all the walls there are stuffed dog heads.

Cleo leaves the luggage next to a bunk bed and looks at the heads.

BENITA
Señor José had the room
redecorated. They’re the Hacienda
dogs. Look... They were all in

storage.

They look at a German Shepherd’s head with glass eyes.
 
62.


CONTINUED:

BENITA (CONT’D)
Look, that there is Pirata. He

lived here in 1911.

A small plaque confirms this. It also indicates his name - Pirata. Cleo looks on, impressed.

CLEO
Pirata...

BENITA
And do you remember Canela?

CLEO
Yeah, where’s she at?

BENITA
Look at her.

Cleo looks at an Irish Setter’s head.

CLEO
Yikes!

BENITA
She died during the summer.

Cleo looks at Canela, horrified.

CLEO
They say she must have eaten a poisoned rat. But I think it was the villagers who are bothering Don José again about the land...

Canela looks at them with her glass eyes.



EXT - SMALL CLEARING IN THE WOODS - HACIENDA - DAY

The winter light filters through the trees and reflects on the great puddle stretching between the clearing and the woods.

Children run between the trees throwing firecrackers, two dogs follow them, jumping in the puddle. Adults are practicing shooting bottles lined up on tree stumps with .22 caliber pistols at the other end of the clearing.
 
63.


With the exception of nannies and servants looking after the younger children, everyone is white and, except for Señora Sofía and her children, they’re dressed in imported clothing.

The sound of shots fuses with the firecrackers.

Toño plays “tochito” flag-football with PEPE DE LA BÁRCENA, 13, EDUARDO LARSSON, a 12 year-old redhead, and RICKY EDWARDS, 11.

Cleo looks after Pepe and keeps LUPE, 30, company as well as YOLA, 22, who look after JORGE DE LA BÁRCENA, 7, who suffers from intellectual disability, and partial paralysis in a leg and arm, and his brother MEMO, 5, who has autism spectre disorder. They’re sitting on a tablecloth, playing with Matchbox cars.

A little further back, GLORIA, 34, who works as a nanny with the Edwards’, sits on another tablecloth with a toy china set, probably more expensive than a real one, and looks after Sofi who is playing with JULY EDWARDS, 7, VERO MATOS, 8, and ANDREA, a girl whose blond hair is almost white, also 8. GERARDO LARSSON, 10, a flamboyant chubby redhead plays with them too.

Paco, along with RODRI DE LA BÁRCENA, 10, ALEX MATOS, 10 and ANDY EDWARDS, 8, appear from behind the trees and throw firecrackers at the girls. They scream. Some even cry.

CLEO (CONT’D)
I saw you, Paco! Get out of here!

The boys run off, laughing and splashing across the puddle.

LUPE
Rodri! Don’t run in the water!

You’re soaking wet!

Dr. ALEJANDRO MATOS, 40, with a goatee, shoots while smoking his pipe.

Next to him, RICARDO EDWARDS, friendly, 39, OVE LARSSON, a towering redheaded shy Norwegian, 41, and LESLIE MATOS, a blond American, 38 also shoot while DR. JOSÉ DE LA BÁRCENA, 41, waits his turn and CELSO, the hacienda foreman, 35, reloads the guns.

DR. JOSÉ DE LA BÁRCENA Celso, do you still have bullets or should I send Lupe to get the ones in the chest?

CELSO
 
64.


CONTINUED:

A few yards away, Sofía, Claudia, Molly and Samantha sit in folding chairs, chatting.

Señora Sofía sees the boys running through the trees. She gets up and yells -

SEÑORA SOFÍA
Don’t run over there, you could get shot!

Molly seconds her, with her thick accent -

MOLLY
Boys! Vayase! Andy, get back!

FLOR, 17, a servant from the Hacienda, stands at a table with a cooler, pouring the adults drinks,

LOLA, 12 going on 19, made up, dressed in a tiny mini-skirt and platform shoes, takes advantage of the adults’ distraction to pour whisky into her Coca-Cola. Next to her, CLAU DE LA BÁRCENA, 11, seems amused, but her curiosity does not yet supersede her obedience.

ON THE CHILDREN’S TABLECLOTH -

The interaction with Jorge and Memo is difficult so Pepe is bored and watches the shooting party. He gets up and walks over there.
