CLEO
Wait, Pepe. Where are you going?

Pepe just points and keeps walking. Cleo follows him and they reach the -

SHOOTING PARTY -

Where Dr. Alejandro Matos has fired his eight rounds and goes to Celso to recharge his gun. He calls to the women on the folding chairs -

DR. ALEJANDRO MATOS
What? Don’t ladies shoot?

The women decline with their hands -

MOLLY
Leslie is our representative!
 
65.


DR. ALEJANDRO MATOS
Leslie doesn’t count, she’s a

gringa.

The women laugh. Claudia gets up -

CLAUDIA
Coming!

SAMANTHA
(In English)

Yes, Claudia. You show them, girl!

Celso gives Alejandro the reloaded gun while Leslie arrives with hers. Celso takes it and quickly reloads it. Pepe picks up the empty cartridges off the ground. Cleo helps him.

Celso gives Alejandro a loaded gun, who gives it to Claudia -

DR. ALEJANDRO MATOS
(in English)

Leslie, could you help Claudia?

LESLIE
Come. Point the gun to the floor

when you’re not using it.

Cokes in hand, Clau and Lola mingle with the adults. They come upon Leslie -

LESLIE (CONT’D)
(In English)
C’mon, Lola. You really have to
wear a miniskirt and platform

shoes? We’re in the woods.

Lola keeps walking and pays no attention to her mother.

CLAUDIA
Forget her. You look great, Lola.

Lola and Clau reach the shooting party and its male acceptance.

DR. JOSÉ DE LA BÁRCENA
Let’s see Lola, you want to shoot?

LOLA
Sure.

Lola walks up to José who gives her the gun while he hugs her from the back, to “help” her shoot.
 
66.


CONTINUED:

DR. JOSÉ DE LA BÁRCENA
Don’t close your eyes when you

shoot...

Cleo looks at Alejandro walking over to the drink table tended by Flor.

DR. ALEJANDRO MATOS
Can you pour me a whisky with two

ice cubes?

Flor fixes his drink.

AT THE SHOOTING PARTY -

Everyone celebrates Claudia’s nailing two bottles. She shoots four more shots in a row and pops off four more bottles. Everyone celebrates -

RICARDO EDWARDS
Be careful Pepe, your wife is like a guerrilla fighter!

Everyone laughs.

Flor hands Alejandro his whisky and, taking advantage of the confusion, he spanks her. Flor runs away, terrified.

More bottles explode.

INT - PARLOUR- HACIENDA - NIGHT

Dozens of floor lamps and table lamps light an immense nave with an enormous chimney guzzling up thick logs facing a broad living room with huge leather sofas decorated with furs.

Adults converse, some sitting on the couches, others standing, all are drinking and some are smoking. Pepe is on Sofi’s lap, and Gerardo is next to his mother.

Yvonne Elliman’s voice rings through the air, singing “I Don’t Know How to Love You.” The girls play cards in a long table in front of the French window that opens to a terrace. Outside, the boys throw firecrackers and rockets.

Other boys play “Trominos” on the floor and in a smaller living room, Lola, drink in hand, gossips with Clau.

Cleo is with Yola, who looks after Memo, who is obsessively turning a plate on the floor, and after Jorge, who plays with a little car.
 
67.


CONTINUED:

Pepe, July Edwards and Andrew Larsson come in from the terrace howling and laughing, chased after by a strange monster. It’s a scarecrow with a straw body and long furs, a wooden mask covering its face.

Something like a pagan spirit, rum and coke in hand, now chasing after the younger children, who flee happily.

Cleo sees Flor walk in with a tray carrying too many milks and milkshakes. She hurries to help her -

The milk glasses dance perilously on the platter while Flor loses her balance, but Cleo rushes just in the nick of time.

Together they walk over to the table and serve beverages to the girls.

The scratch of a needle on a record as the metals of an orchestra blast a mambo rhythm: the tune changes to Perez Prado’s “Corazón de Melón.”

Samantha jumps up with a cry and starts to dance -

SAMANTHA
Come on, comadre!

Sofía and Molly get up and dance with her. Ricardo Edwards in his Ricky Ricardo impersonation, walks by yelling -

RICARDO EDWARDS
Co-ra-zón de melón, de melón melón!

Corazón!

He joins in the dancing. Alejandro follows and dances with Sofía. Lola and Clau also join, Gerardo dances with his mother. Ove with July.

Benita comes into the living room and looks around. Molly is trying to get Vero and Andrea to go to bed, but they don’t want to.

Cleo and Flor look on, amused, sucked in by the Mambo. Cleo sees -

Pepe, joining the dance and going up to his mother, who pays no attention since she’s too busy dancing with Alejandro.

Benita walks up to Cleo.

BENITA
Come her for a sec.
 
68.


CONTINUED:

Cleo looks at her, confused -

BENITA (CONT’D)
Just come over for a sec.

Cleo looks around -

CLEO
But... what if?

BENITA
What? Is a kid going to cry because he lost at marbles or his brother stepped on him?

Cleo looks at her, amused, and follows her. They cross the room to the entrance.

RICARDO EDWARDS
Co-ra-zón de me-lón, de me-lón, me-

lón, co-ra-zón!


EXT. - CORRIDOR - HACIENDA - NIGHT

Benita guides Cleo, who follows amused and curious down the corridor lit with candles. The leave the MAMBO behind and go down -


INT. - STAIRS - HACIENDA - NIGHT

The stone staircase leads down to an internal patio that doubles as storage.

A couple of men chat, lit by the light from a kitchen window. Inside there’s a racket around an accordion exhaling a ranchera-style polka.

Three dogs meander about the patio, waiting for a New Year’s gift.

Benita and Cleo walk into -


INT. - KITCHEN - HACIENDA - NIGHT

A hall with a vaulted ceiling lit by bare light bulbs hosts an enormous ancient kitchen with wood burning stoves, a giant table, a Mabe stove and two 1961 refrigerators.
 
69.


CONTINUED:

The Hacienda WORKERS celebrate New Year’s. Benita guides Cleo to the table.

Women are serving plates of food from large clay pots. A 65 year-old man plays the accordion and some spontaneous guy improvises a quebradita dance with Gloria, who is clearly drunk. She sees Cleo -

GLORIA
What? They finally let you out?

Cleo laughs. At the table, everyone drinks, some eat, some are dressed for the occasion, many are not. A 1959 television set transmits Channel 2’s New Year’s special.

BENITA
What’ll you have?

CLEO
Nothing, thank you.

BENITA
What? You’re not going to toast the New Year with us? What, you only speak English now?

CLEO
It’s just that... the baby...

BENITA
A drink on New Year’s will do it good. Celebrate while you can. See that guy with the hat?

Cleo sees a man with a hat talking somberly with two other men -

BENITA (CONT’D)
They killed his son in August. The villagers did. Because of a land dispute.

Cleo looks at him, moved.

BENITA (CONT’D)
You got life?

CLEO
Sure...

BENITA
I mean liquor.
 
70.


CONTINUED:

Benita pours her a shot of moonshine.

CLEO
I’d rather just have a little

pulque.

BENITA
That’s the spirit!

She pours pulque into a jar and hands it to Cleo. The two toast.

BENITA (CONT’D)
Here’s to a beautiful 1971 and to

your baby’s health!

CLEO AND BENITA
Cheers!

Benita takes the jar to her lips and Cleo draws her pulque close to hers when Gloria trips dancing her quebradita and bumps into Cleo.

Before even touching her lips, the pulque jar falls to the ground and shatters into a million pieces.

GLORIA
Sorry, manita!

BENITA
No sweat. You dance, we got plenty more where that came from!

She pours pulque into a new jar. Gloria keeps dancing. Cleo holds the other pulque but looks worriedly down at the shattered jar on the floor.


INT. - INTERNAL PATIO - STAIRS - HACIENDA - NIGHT

Cleo exits the kitchen. She’s a little tipsy. The patio is empty except for the dogs who follow her until she reaches the stairs that lead up to -


EXT. - CORRIDOR - HACIENDA - NIGHT

Cleo walks down the candle-lit corridor and back into the living room where “Mummy Blues” is playing on the stereo. She sees a silhouette resting on the balustrade: it’s Señora Sofía.
 
71.


CONTINUED:

Alejandro Matos comes out of the parlour and comes close to Sofía, hugging her from behind. Sofía reacts, turning around in surprise.

SEÑORA SOFÍA
What are you doing?

Alejandro tries to kiss her, but she rejects him.

DR. ALEJANDRO MATOS
Come, now... You know you want

to...

Sofía struggles to free herself.

SEÑORA SOFÍA
No, Alex! Leave me alone! You’re

drunk!

She pushes him. Alejandro holds his hands up, resentful and resigned -

DR. ALEJANDRO MATOS
Fine. Fine! I just wanted to

comfort you, but...

He begins to walk back into the parlour.

DR. ALEJANDRO MATOS (CONT’D) It’s not even like you’re that hot, comadre...

Señora Sofía leans into the balustrade, confused and agitated. She looks in Cleo’s direction, but Cleo hides behind a column.

Señora Sofía walks back into the parlour, Cleo waits for her to leave before coming out of her hiding spot. She leans on the balustrade and looks out at the night.

When her eyes get used to the darkness, she can see the darker silhouettes of the trees in front of a sky that seems to be lit from within.

The cricket song melts into “Mummy Blues”, ending on a scratch, and the accordion which seems to be playing a mazurca. The wind blows softly.

Through the darkness in the woods, a pale light appears, almost blending into the night. Cleo watches in fascination.
 
72.


CONTINUED:

The Shocking Blue’s “Venus” starts to play. The dogs start barking.

The shining starts to spread out in a warm, attractive pulsing, like a will o’ the wisp or an apparition.

Cleo watches, hypnotized. But what started off as a soft glow begins to rip through the night in an intense gleam that dances in the trees.

The barks become more insistent. Someone screams -

SCREAMING
Fire! Fire! In the woods!

A racket. More screaming. More barking.

In the garden, Celso runs, carrying a bucket. Other workers follow after him, carrying buckets and pots overflowing with water. They run towards the woods in flames.


EXT - SMALL CLEARING IN THE WOODS - HACIENDA - NIGHT

The giant puddle reflects the flames dancing over the rocks on the ground. The fire licks the trees and spreads into the branches.

The flames push forward, devouring the clearing grass, that very same place where just this afternoon they were all shooting.

Celso runs to the fire and empties out his bucket. The workers do the same. They come back for more water and cross paths with yet other workers carrying various containers.

Dr. José arrives carrying two buckets, followed by Ricardo Edwards, with one. Further behind, Dr. Alejandro Matos and Leslie carry a heavy washbasin.

Gloria, Flor, Yola and Cleo all bring their containers. Even the kids. Everyone runs, comes, goes... the dogs keep their distance.

A human chain starts to form: buckets pass from hand to hand, everyone trying to put out the fire.

The pagan monster with his drink in hand arrives. He looks at his watch -
 
73.


CONTINUED:

OVE
(In English)

23...22...21...20...19...18...17...

The monster takes off his mask, revealing a sweaty and drunk Ove -

OVE (CONT’D)
16...15...14...13...12...11...10...

The human chain begins to work efficiently. Pepe even puts out a few blades of glass with his little cup.

OVE (CONT’D)
...7...6...5...4...3...2...1...

HAPPY NEW YEAR!

But no one pays attention. Everyone is working, trying to control the fire.

OVE (CONT’D)
Happy New year!

Ove starts singing in Norwegian. It’s an emotional Nyttarbukk song.

OVE (CONT’D)
Pkfmsll apdkfn alosnnm...

The children go to the puddle and fill up their little containers. The dogs follow them, splashing. The reflection is disarticulated in waves that bump into each other.

OVE (CONT’D)
Pkfmsll apdkfn alosnnm...

Ove sings with conviction. His eyes fill with tears.





Friday, January 1st, 1971.


EXT. - SMALL CLEARING IN THE WOODS - DAWN

Dew makes the woods shine, though they’re still dark and smoking. The first rays of the new year sun filter through the trees.

Four folding chairs rest the middle of the clearing, charred.
 
74.


EXT. - FIELD - HACIENDA - AFTERNOON

The Iztaccíhuatl sleeps, immense, behind the hills and dusty crops. The afternoon light filters through rain-leaden clouds.

A group of children run and explore.

Toño, Pepe de la Bárcena, Ricky, Paco, Rodri, Alex and Eduardo lead the front throwing each other football passes. Paco, Rodri, and Alex chase after chameleons in the furrows.

Lola and Clau walk next to them. Vero, Sofi, Gerardo, Andrea and July are further back. Pepe and Andy walk with Yola.

Cleo walks with Benita. The dogs run everywhere. Alex chases after a chameleon, Rodri and Paco follow.

BENITA
Don’t run too far. We’ll just reach to the outskirts and come back!

Paco stops-

PACO
What skirts?

BENITA
The hillside.

Paco laughs.

PACO
You mean the hill has skirts?

BENITA
The outskirts... well, the slopes

then!

PACO
Alex, the hill has a skirt!

Alex stops.

PACO (CONT’D)
If we lean over we’ll be able to

see its panties.

Paco pretends to lean and Alex does the same. Lola and Clau catch up to them -

CLAUDIA
What are you guys doing?
 
75.


CONTINUED:

PACO
Looking up the hill’s skirts to see its panties.

LOLA
Hills don’t have underwear.

Paco leans under her and lifts up her miniskirt.

PACO
And neither do you!

Lola screams and pats down her skirt -

LOLA
Asshole!

PACO
Ooooooh!

Alex lifts up Clau’s dress. She screams.

GLORIA
Alex! Paco! Leave the girls alone!

The boys run, amused.

Cleo and Benita stop. A gust of wind conjures dust devils. A low thunder rumbles and rain falls in the distance.

Cleo looks at the landscape dreamily. Her hands rest on her belly.

CLEO
It’s like my village. Without the
mountain, of course, but it looks

just like this...

She enjoys the moment while she rubs her belly. She closes her eyes -

CLEO (CONT’D)
This is how it sounds...

The church bells ringing and the bleating of goats get lost in the distance.

CLEO (CONT’D)
Just like this...

She breathes. Breathes deep. She smiles -
 
76.




CONTINUED:

CLEO (CONT’D)
This is how it smells...

Cleo is somewhere else.



Friday, January 29, 1971.

EXT - TEPEJI 21 - DAY (RAIN)

The Valiant is parked in front of the house, next to the Galaxie 500.

The Valiant overflows with the children. One more comes out: Toño’s friend, BETO PARDO, 12, with glasses and good-boy looks. He’s come for lunch.

Paco shows off the black Galaxie, its scrapes and bent moldings recently repaired -

PACO
Look, they fixed it all up. Just

like new, right?

Beto barely looks at it. He keeps going and goes into the house after Toño.


INT - BREAKFAST ROOM - TEPEJI 21 - DAY

Cleo’s belly is starting to show. She cuts Pepe’s meat.

Señora Teresa eats in silence. The children talk while they eat -

TOÑO
The Cowboys won only because

Baltimore was overconfident.

BETO
What are you talking about? We
scored three touchdowns in the

second half. One after the other!

Señora Sofía comes down the stairs and into the breakfast room.
 
77.


CONTINUED:

TOÑO
I’m telling you. Baltimore was overconfident. How can you root for the Cowboys?

SOFI
I like the Cowboy’s cheerleaders.

In my school...

PACO
Who cares about cheerleaders?

Señora Sofía comes into the breakfast room. Her face is drawn. Señora Teresa looks at her, worried.

TOÑO
Ma? Can Beto and I go to the

movies?

Señora Sofía is absent -

SEÑORA SOFÍA
What are you going to see?

TOÑO
The Red Tent, at The Americas

theater.

PACO
I want to go too!

TOÑO
No, just Beto and me.

PACO
How come?

TOÑO
Get yourself your own friends!

SOFI
I want to go to the movies too!

TOÑO
I said no! It’s just me and Beto.

Señora Sofía explodes -

SEÑORA SOFÍA
Either everyone goes or no one

goes!
 
78.




CONTINUED:

TOÑO
They can go to a different movie!

PACO
I want to go to Las Americas!

TOÑO
You don’t even know what The Red

Tent is!

SEÑORA SOFÍA
I said, either everyone goes or no one goes!

The telephone rings, Señora Sofía gets up and walks to the hall to answer -

TOÑO
It’s not fair!

Señora Sofía comes back -

SEÑORA SOFÍA
If you don’t like it you can go

live somewhere else!

She walks over to pick up the phone, leaving Toño furious.
Paco smiles impertinently.

PEPE
Is it a cartoon?

Señora Sofía answers -

SEÑORA SOFÍA
Hello? Oh, yes, hold on a minute...

She calls to the breakfast room -



SEÑORA SOFÍA (CONT’D) Cleo! I’m going to get this upstairs, would you mind hanging up here!

She goes upstairs. Cleo walks to the phone and she hears Señora Sofía calling -
 
79.


CONTINUED:

SEÑORA SOFÍA (O.S.) (CONT’D)
There...!

Cleo is about to hang up the phone when she overhears...

MOLLY (V.O.)
How are you feeling, comadre?

Cleo hangs up.


INT. - DOWNSTAIRS HALL - TEPEJI 21 - AFTERNOON

Everyone’s ready to go to the movies. Señora Teresa is going too, because she worries and because she loves going to the movies. She calls up to the children -

SEÑORA TERESA
We’re late! You coming down or

what?

Paco and Sofi are already by her side.

PACO
Let them stay. Let’s go...

SEÑORA TERESA
We’re leaving!

Señora Teresa goes out to the Patio with Cleo, Paco, Sofi and Pepe.


EXT. - PATIO - TEPEJI 21 - AFTERNOON

The group reaches the street entrance and Señora Teresa opens the door. Borras takes advantage of the situation to run out despite Cleo and Paco’s attempts to stop him.

Paco runs out.


EXT. - TEPEJI 21- AFTERNOON

He chases the dog down and drags him back into the house where the group is waiting outside the door.

Paco leaves the dog inside and is about to close the door when Toño and Beto come out.

TOÑO
What are you waiting for?
 
80.




CONTINUED:

The two hurry up to the corner heading towards Insurgentes.
Everyone follows them.


EXT. - TEPIC STREET - AFTERNOON

Toño and Beto are at the front. Cleo and Señora Teresa look after Sofi and Pepe who is talking to Paco about planes.

PACO
...Braniff planes may be different colors but they’re all 727s...

They’re on Tepic street, near Insurgentes when Toño and Beto, take off in a well planned strategy.

TOÑO
See you at the movies!

The pair run off.

SEÑORA TERESA
Toño!

Señora Teresa asks Cleo to follow them.

Cleo embarks on her mission. She hurries without losing Toño and Beto from sight, their two little mischievous figures already half a block away. They ring doorbells and run away.

Cleo shortens the distance with each step, getting closer, but not too close. And so, she follows them.

When they reach Insurgentes the boys run off, and turn, disappearing at the corner. Cleo hurries and turns the corner to -


EXT. - INSURGENTES AVENUE - LAS AMERICAS CINEMA - DUSK

Cleo reaches the bustling avenue, brimming with its early Friday night energy. People walk in all directions and the street lights, the cars, the shop windows and the ads are all lighting up.
 
81.


CONTINUED:

She sees people crossing to the other side of Insurgentes, where the marquee announces Melody, but she doesn’t see the boys. She worries and walks to the following corner, searching.

She’s almost made it to the newspaper stand in the next corner when she turns and looks to -

THE OTHER SIDE OF INSURGENTES

And there, amongst the crowd coming out of the theater and spilling onto the sidewalk, she sees Señor Antonio. He looks light and happy and dances a silly step to the great delight and laughter of the YOUNG WOMAN who holds his hand.

And that’s when she also finally spots Beto, hiding on one side of the news stand, lost in the pages of Caballero men’s magazine.

Beyond, Toño is also holding a magazine, but he’s not looking at the naked women in its pages. He’s looking at the other side of the street: people are coming out of the theater and his dad is playing Fred Astaire to a Ginger Rogers that is not his mother.

In his silly dance move, Señor Antonio trips with an OLDER COUPLE who is annoyed. Señor Antonio and the young woman laugh and hurry off.

OLDER COUPLE
So rude...!

Señor Antonio stops, turns and to sprays bullets at the older couple with his make believe machine gun, escaping with the young woman, Bonnie & Clyde, hand in hand.



Wednesday, March 24th, 1971.


INT/EXT - PUBLIC BUS - CALZADA IGNACIO ZARAGOZA - DAY

Cleo’s riding a bus full of people.


EXT. - DIRT AVENUE - CIUDAD NEZAHUALCÓYOTL - DAY

Cleo climbs down the bus, her six-month belly is obvious and the contrast with the Roma neighborhood is evident too -
 
82.


CONTINUED:

The dirt avenue is flanked by large electric towers and riddled with pot holes where stagnant water pools.

The houses are made of cement brick, corrugated cardboard and asbestos sheets. There’s lots of trash and plastic.

Cleo shows a piece of paper to a PEDESTRIAN who points to a street up the avenue.

Cleo heads up the street.


EXT.- STREET- HOUSE - CIUDAD NEZAHUALCÓYOTL - DAY

Cleo walks on. Misery is palpable, there are children and stray dogs everywhere and a stream of raw sewage running down the street.

Different music booms out of each house.

Three dogs block her way and bark. Cleo crouches, pretending to get a rock and the dogs run off.

She reaches a house and double-checks the address on her paper. She comes to the door and knocks.

Impertinent dogs answer her knocking next to the entrance.

Cleo knocks again as the door opens.

It’s Ramón.


INT/EXT - DATSUN - OCEANÍA AVE - DAY

Cleo rides alone in the back seat. In front, Ramón is in the driver’s seat, and his friend CANCHAS, is in the passenger seat, smoking pot. He gives the joint to Ramón, who takes a drag and passes it to Cleo, who refuses.


EXT. - PARKING LOT - EMPTY LOT- SAN JUAN DE ARAGÓN AND CUCHILLA DEL TESORO - DAY

NEXT TO THE FIELD -

About a hundred young men in uniformed t-shirts and tennis shoes are in resting position, supervised by three instructors with martial airs, pants and sweat-shirts.

They pay attention to a man in sweat pants and a sleeveless t-shirt who makes an exercise demonstration -
 
83.


CONTINUED:

The man does push-ups with his index finger only.

A young man standing next to Cleo says with admiration -

YOUNG MAN
It’s Zovek.

CLEO
(in disbelief)

No...! Zovek?

YOUNG MAN
Look at ‘im...

CLEO
Is that really professor Zovek?

YOUNG MAN
He’s done over a hundred push ups

by now!

CLEO
What? Does he always come here?

YOUNG MAN
No, not always, but sometimes he

comes to train them.

PROFESSOR ZOVEK counts to 150, pushes hard on his fingers and in one swift move is on his feet, crossing his wrists over his head.

The young men applaud.

PROFESSOR ZOVEK
You too can be a Kombateka! Every human being holds great potential he must develop through physical conditioning and through mental and spiritual evolution.

Zovek walks amongst them.

PROFESSOR ZOVEK (CONT’D) You too can develop your potential. But don’t expect any miracles, the only miracle lies in your own will.

Zovek stops -
 
84.


CONTINUED:

PROFESSOR ZOVEK (CONT’D) This is why mental development is the true motor of physical development.

He stretches his arms, taking his audience in -

PROFESSOR ZOVEK (CONT’D)
And next up... an act!

A strip of bandage hangs from one of his hands, swaying in the dusty breeze -

ON THE EDGE OF THE FIELD -

Cleo and the small audience call out in surprise -

SMALL AUDIENCE

Ooooooh!

Zovek exclaims -

PROFESSOR ZOVEK
This is a routine that requires
absolute physical condition! Only
martial arts masters and a few

great athletes can master it!

Professor Zovek extends the bandage to a YOUTH in the first row.

PROFESSOR ZOVEK (CONT’D) Yes... You... please bandage my eyes.

The youth walks up shyly to Professor Zovek and takes the bandage, starts to bandage his eyes -

PROFESSOR ZOVEK (CONT’D)
Make sure they’re totally covered.

You’ve got plenty of bandage there.

They youth has completely covered Professor Zovek’s eyes.

PROFESSOR ZOVEK (CONT’D) Thank you, you may return to your place.

The youth walks back to his spot.
 
85.


PROFESSOR ZOVEK (CONT’D)
And now...!

Professor Zovek flexes his biceps and puts the fingers in both of his hands together in a diamond shape over his head. He inhales deeply and -

PROFESSOR ZOVEK (CONT’D)
(Exhaling)

Huuuuuuuh!

He is quiet.

The young people look on, expectantly.

AT THE EDGE OF THE FIELD -

Cleo and the small audience look on in awe.

Professor Zovek is standing, motionless, with his diamond over his head and slowly, very slowly starts to lift his left foot.

Time has stopped.

The left foot lifts up, folding at the knee until the thigh is at a 45 degree angle, and he remains motionless in that position.

The young people await in confusion for something to happen.

AT THE EDGE OF THE FIELD -

Cleo and the small audience are also waiting, a boy crouches down.

Professor Zovek continues on, motionless -

PROFESSOR ZOVEK (CONT’D) Are you disappointed? Were you expecting me to lift a jet or an elephant?

The audience laughs.

PROFESSOR ZOVEK (CONT’D) You are witnessing an incredible feat! You don’t believe me? Try it.

Professor Zovek talks but remains motionless -

PROFESSOR ZOVEK (CONT’D) Just close your eyes and lift up a foot.

(MORE)
 
86.

PROFESSOR ZOVEK (CONT’D) You don’t have to lift your leg to a forty-five degree angle like me or put your arms up. Just close your eyes and lift a foot.

IN THE ROWS -

The young men close their eyes and try lifting one foot. They quickly lose their balance.

The instructors also try it without succeeding.

AT THE EDGE OF THE FIELD -

Cleo and the small audience also tries it out, some child lasts a little longer but they all fail.

Professor Zovek explains -

PROFESSOR ZOVEK (CONT’D) True mental preparation is the path to physical realization.

The small audience begins to notice that -

Cleo is on one foot, forming a diamond with her fingers over her head.

Her eyes closed, placid.

EXT - FIELDS - EMPTY LOT - LATER

A trainer blows his whistle and the formation breaks up. The young men pick up their belongings at the edge of the field and walk over to the parking lot.

Cleo watches them walk by, and in a small group she finds -

Fermín, who walks talking, animated.

Cleo wants to call him, but is anxiously silent. Fermín and his group walk right past her.

Cleo finally calls to him -

CLEO
Fermín!

Perhaps a little too loud. Fermín turns and when he sees her, he stops. Others in his group stop with him

FERMÍN
What’s up my Cleo?
 
87.


CONTINUED:

CLEO
Can you talk for a minute?

The group surrounding Fermín make fun of him -

GROUP
Wooooooooooooo!

Fermín smiles and walks towards Cleo gesturing good bye to his group.

Cleo and Fermín walk one toward the other in the emptying lot.

IN THE BACKGROUND -

An Eastern Airlines Boeing 727 takes off and flies over the couple approaching in the middle of the lot.

FERMÍN
Long time no see, Cleo!


CLEO
Hi, Fermín...

They meet and kiss hello.

FERMÍN
What are you doing around these

parts?

CLEO
Well, I have left you so many messages and I’ve been looking for you but I can never find you so...

Fermín starts heading toward the parking lot -

FERMÍN
I’m sorry my Cleo, but the training got real hard core and they even brought in a gringo trainer and another one from Korea. Well, the American had been here already, but the Korean one is new.

CLEO
Is it for the Olympics?
 
88.


CONTINUED:

FERMÍN
Something like that. Who told you I was here?

Cleo hesitates -

CLEO
It’s just that a neighbor’s brother in law trains with you so...

FERMÍN
(interrupting)

It was Ramón, right?

CLEO
No, no, no!

Fermín stops -

FERMÍN
Son of a... Fucking Ramón. I’ll get him when I see him -

He makes some pretend impressive aikido movements -

FERMÍN (CONT’D)
Jodan Tsuki!... Chudan Tsuki!...

Mae Geri!...

Flash blows, precise kicks and body contact with the air.

CLEO
It’s just that... I’m with child...

Fermín stops mid-punch. He keeps walking to the parking lot.

FERMÍN
What’s it to me?

Cleo follows him -

CLEO
Well, the little one’s yours.

Fermin walks faster.

FERMÍN
No fucking way!

CLEO
But it is, Fermín!
 
89.


CONTINUED:

Fermín stops completely and turns to Cleo -

FERMÍN
I told you already, there’s no fucking way! So if you don’t want me to fuck you up real bad, you and your “little one” too, don’t ever fucking say it again and don’t ever come looking for me again!

He does some aikido movements culminating in a mortal blow to Cleo, stopping less than half an inch from her face and then walks off.

FERMÍN (CONT’D)
Fucking cunt!

He leaves Cleo alone in the empty lot.



Friday, May 14th, 1971.


EXT. - SMALL PATIO - TEPEJI 21 - DAY

Borras barks like crazy. Cleo holds his collar but is lost in her own sadness. Her almost-eight-month belly is very large.

The old man with the oranges puts three more oranges in the crate on the floor. It’s almost full.

OLD MAN WITH ORANGES
...20.

The old man gets up and Adela pays him with a crumpled 20-peso bill.

Further back, Cleo holds on to Borras, who tries to lunge at the old man with each bark.

The old man slowly carries the immense sack of oranges and puts it on his back. He starts walking towards -


EXT. - PATIO - TEPEJI 21- DAY

Where Cleo is holding Borras who pushes up on his hind legs to attack the old man who walks past them on his way to the street.
 
90.


CONTINUED:

The old man is halfway down the patio when Borras tugs hard, surprising Cleo, who is lost in thought and lets go.

Borras runs down to the old man who hurries to the door as he feels the dog coming. Borras chases him.

CLEO
Borras!

Borras lunges at the old man and sinks his teeth into the enormous sack.

Dozens of oranges fall out rolling all over the patio.

The old man lets go of the sack and runs to the door while Borras is trying to finish off the sack.

Cleo runs up to Borras on the orange-covered floor. The old man is almost at the door when the dog realizes this and runs after him.

The old man reaches the door and opens. Borras is about to sink in his teeth when the old man exits and shuts the door. Borras can’t stop and smashes against the door.

Cleo is standing in the middle of the patio, surrounded by an ocean of oranges.


INT. DOWNSTAIRS - TEPEJI 21- DAY

The midday light bounces off the patio walls and slides in through the great windows, softly caressing the modern mahogany table.

Cleo polishes the surface with a rag. She rubs the rag over and over the same spot, as if she wanted to wipe her own reflection.

The house is quiet. Only the rumor of a conversation is heard. The phone cable extending all the way into the bathroom under the stairs disappears inside the door.

Señora Sofía is inside, talking. Her voice echoes in the small space and filters though the doors. Only a few words can be clearly heard.

Paco comes down the stairs slowly. Stopping in the middle, he leans over the railway, trying to hear better.

Cleo keeps polishing the same area of the table and finally realizes Paco is coming down the stairs.
 
91.


CONTINUED:

Paco’s in the hall and walks slowly to the bathroom door, leaning on the wall next to it.

Cleo stops wiping her reflection and sees Paco, who -

Slides and sits down on the floor. He leans against the wall and tries to move his ear closer to the door.

From the dining room, Cleo shoos him away, gesturing, but Paco ignores her, concentrated on listening to the conversation distorted by the bathroom echo and muffled by the door.

SEÑORA SOFÍA (O.C.)
...he wrote them letters from so-

called Vancouver...

Cleo walks up to Paco, gesturing. When she reaches the hall she stops at a respectful distance from the bathroom and its conversation. She stops and shakes her rag vigorously, calling Paco.

SEÑORA SOFÍA (O.C.) (CONT’D)
...he doesn’t even have enough of a pair to tell the children...

He sees her but shakes his head no repeatedly. Cleo comes a few steps closer, still keeping her distance, and speaks by mouthing the words but almost without a single sound.

CLEO
(articulating)

G-e-t o-u-t- o-f h-e-r-e

Paco is about to shake his head no but a cry punctures the echoes and the walls - a deep desperate wail.

Paco and Cleo freeze, scared, when suddenly -

The bathroom door opens and Señora Sofía comes out, carrying the phone. She sees Paco running away and grabs him -

SEÑORA SOFÍA
And you? What are you spying on?...

Her face is gaunt from crying, from all the pain and frustration that explode in a -

Giant slap that throws Paco down on the floor.

Señora Sofía immediately realizes what she’s done and crouches down next to her son, holding him, crying -
 
92.


CONTINUED:

SEÑORA SOFÍA (CONT’D)
I’m sorry, I’m sorry, Paco! Why
were you eavesdropping? Why were

you eavesdropping?

The two of them cry on the floor, Señora Sofía sees Cleo, only a few steps away -

SEÑORA SOFÍA (CONT’D)
And you! Why did you let him?

She hugs Paco tightly -

SEÑORA SOFÍA (CONT’D) Don’t say anything to your brothers and sisters. Don’t say a thing. Promise me... Promise...

To the side, Cleo is motionless, wishing she could join in the hugging and the crying.


INT. - SOFI AND PEPE’S ROOM - TEPEJI 21- DUSK

Cleo brushes Sofi’s hair. They’re sitting on the bed. Sofi reads a letter. Cleo is lost in thought.

SOFI
It has so many drawings. Look, I think this little girl is me and I think this is my daddy...

The letter is done exclusively in blue ink drawings with no color or highlights.

SOFI (CONT’D)
And this is a heart, look, with an S for Sofi and a P for Papa... and this here is a dog... or is it a fish?

Pepe comes in and sits down next to them, leaning over to see the letter.

CLEO
Maybe it’s a dolphin, I think?

SOFI
A dolphin? No. It’s like a

doggie...
 
93.


CONTINUED:

PEPE
It’s a seal! In the fourth letter my dad sent Paco, he said he can see the ocean from his hotel room and that there are a lot of seals.

Sofi considers the drawing -

SOFI
Yes. It’s a seal! Like the ones in his hotel!

PEPE
You had said dolphin. It looks

nothing like a dolphin!

CLEO
No?

SOFI
No!

CLEO
So it’s not a dolphin? What do you think it is?

Sofi and Pepe answer in a chorus -

SOFI AND PEPE
A seal!

And they also laugh in chorus. Distracted by her own sadness, Cleo turns to Pepe and does a surprise tickle attack, prolonging the laughter.

When they’ve calmed down, Pepe is lying on the bed and fixes his eyes on Cleo.

CLEO
What you looking at?

PEPE
When’s your baby coming out?

Sadness washes over Cleo again -

CLEO
Next month.

SOFI
It is a girl?
 
94.


CONTINUED:

CLEO
I don’t know...

SOFI
Oh, please let it be a girl!

Pleeeease! What’s her name?

CLEO
I don’t know.

SOFI
If it’s a girl can her name be

Tabitha like Bewitched?

CLEO
(Absently)

Maybe...

Pepe gets up and looks at her, serious.

PEPE
And will she live here?

SOFI
If she’s a girl yes!

CLEO
I don’t know. Would you like her to live here?

PEPE
No way! Yuck!

Cleo smiles, trying to hide her pain. She changes the topic -

CLEO
Let’s see! Put your pajamas on!

INT. - SENORA SOFIA’S ROOM - TEPEJI 21- DAY

The room glows softly in the light that filters in through the curtains.

Cleo folds freshly washed clothes in the closet drawers. As she opens one she looks down at Señor Antonio’s underwear.

She can hear the children fighting downstairs.
