CONTINUED:

Cleo closes the drawer. She looks at the men’s suits hanging. The yelling grows more intense and in the middle, Señora Teresa -

SEÑORA TERESA (O.C.)
Children! Stop it, Toño! Stop!

Sofi comes running into the room.

SOFI
Cleo! Toño and Paco are fighting!

Cleo comes out to -


INT. - UPSTAIRS HALL - TEPEJI 21- DAY

With her 8-month belly, Cleo slowly goes down the stairs with Sofi. When they come down they see -

IN THE HALL-

Toño who is holding Paco by the hairs. Paco is screaming furiously and attempting to kick Toño.

Señora Teresa is in the living room yelling at the boys. Pepe is standing, paralyzed, next to her.

SEÑORA TERESA
Stop it! Now!

But Paco manages to free himself and hits Toño on the face.
Toño grabs his arms.

IN THE STAIRCASE -

Cleo stops. Sofi takes her hand -

CLEO
Boys!

IN THE HALL -

Paco spits in Toño’s face, leaving him space to give him a good slap.

SEÑORA TERESA
Toño!

And Paco throws himself against Toño once again, while Toño speedily escapes.
 
96.


CONTINUED:

IN THE STAIRCASE -

Cleo is still walking down.

CLEO
Boys! I’m going to tell your mom

when she comes back!

IN THE HALL -

The boys don’t pay any attention to her at all. Paco takes an trinket from the table, a stone egg, and -

HE THROWS IT TO TOÑO -

It flies straight to his head.

SEÑORA TERESA
Paco!

Toño ducks just as the speedy egg projectile, flies exactly over where his face was, following its trajectory through the open doors, out the patio and -

CRASHING against the door of the Valiant, parked just outside.

Señora Teresa runs towards Paco and grabs him hard, shaking him -

SEÑORA TERESA (CONT’D)
What are you doing! Paco!

PACO
He hit me first!

TOÑO
Because you pushed me!

Cleo walks into the hall with Sofi, towards the living room.

SEÑORA TERESA
How could you throw that thing!?

You could have killed your brother!

Paco stops wrestling, remorseful. Cleo comes to Pepe, hugs him and Sofi is with her. Señora Teresa lets go of Paco -

SEÑORA TERESA
You could have killed him!
 
97.


CONTINUED:

Scared, Toño looks at the car door where the egg has left an enormous dent in the metal.


INT. - KITCHEN - TEPEJI 21- NIGHT

The house is quiet again.

Cleo washes dishes. Adela puts them away on the shelves.



ADELA
You head up, manita, I’ll finish up here...

The Galaxie 500 honks its horn -

Ta-ta Ta-ta Ta-ta Ta-taaaaaaaa!

ADELA (CONT’D)
I’ll go.

Adela goes out the small patio and to the patio. Cleo walks to the breakfast room.


INT. - DOWNSTAIRS - TEPEJI 21 - NIGHT

Cleo walks across the breakfast room and the dining room and goes out to the hall. She peeks out the door that opens to the patio.


EXT. PATIO TEPEJI 21 - NIGHT

Ta-ta! Ta-ta! Ta-taaaaaaaa!

Adela walks to the street door, lit from the outside by the car’s headlights.

Ta-ta! Ta-ta! Ta-taaaaaaaa!

Adela opens the door, revealing -

The mighty Galaxie 500 headlights lighting the patio.

The car pulls in slowly but -

Kkkkkkkjjjjjjjjk!

Its left side scratches against the door frame.
 
98.


CONTINUED:

The car brakes and moves back a couple of inches. Adjusts its trajectory and pulls forward again -

Krrrrrrajjjj!

Now its right side hits the frame.

The car stops and veers its wheels left. Moves forward.

Kkkjjjjjkkk!

The left molding catches the frame and begins to bend. The car stops.

Backs up.

Goes forward again and now the right side molding is the one that’s caught. The car stops.

Backs up.

It starts forward again and the right side molding is ripped from the metal, but now the car doesn’t stop. It just heads straight in, ripping the entire left side molding too.

It adjusts its course once more. The side mirror catches and is ripped off.

The Galaxie 500 stops only momentarily to follow its course with even greater conviction, hitting and denting both sides, its molding bent in strange shapes.

Finally, the Galaxie stops in front of the door that opens to the hall.


INT. - DOWNSTAIRS HALL - TEPEJI 21 - NIGHT

Cleo is next to the patio door. Outside -

The Galaxie door opens and Señora Sofía comes out. She stumbles as she walks and comes into the house without closing the car door. She is obviously drunk.

Cleo moves aside to let her through. Señora Sofía looks at her, amused -

SEÑORA SOFÍA
We’re alone. Always. Even though

they say we aren’t.

She laughs and Cleo looks at her, confused.
 
99.


CONTINUED:

Señora Sofía walks on and staggers up the stairs.



Thursday, June 10th, 1971.

INT/EXT - VALIANT	- STREET - AFTERNOON

Ignacio is driving. Cleo is sitting in the front and Señora Teresa rides behind, alone. They drive slowly in heavy traffic.

A parked car tries to come out onto the street. Ignacio stops and lets it through -

IGNACIO
Maybe if we park over here, far
away, because there’s a student

protest.

There’s a bustle of young people on the sidewalks and walking up the street. Some carry pickets and painted slogans.

SEÑORA TERESA
I hope they don’t get them again...

The parked car frees up a space and Ignacio tries to park.


EXT. - STREET NEAR MEXICO-TACUBA - AFTERNOON

The Valiant parks, Señora Teresa and Cleo come out with Ignacio accompanying them. Cleaning trucks are parked along the block.

They walk amongst the students heading up the street to the corner which is surveilled by police vehicles, and they pass in front of a group of young men dressed in T-shirts, waiting.


EXT. - CALZADA MEXICO-TACUBA - AFTERNOON

Ignacio accompanies Teresa and Cleo, who walk slowly. Cleo on account of her belly, and Señora Teresa due to her limp. The storefront metallic curtains are all shut.

They walk in front of a long row of riot police trucks, lines of police officers while a group of young men carrying bamboo canes gathers at the corner.
 
100.


They reach Calzada México - Tacuba and it’s closed off. The beginning of an enormous march passes next to them, walking from north to south on the Avenue.

Señora Teresa, Cleo and Ignacio are forced to cross in the middle of the march. They melt in with the crowd - some have pickets, others sing slogans.

They manage to make it to the other side of the avenue and head towards the entrance of a building advertising a furniture store on the second floor, letters painted on its windows.

Señora Teresa and Cleo walk in. Ignacio waits outside.


INT. - FURNITURE STORE - CALZADA MEXICO TACUBA - AFTERNOON

The afternoon sun lights the MUEBLERÍA sign painted all along the windows, staining the floor with its upside-down letters.

A handful of clients walks around the store, which sells cheap and functional furniture. The din of the march fills the place with chanting and slogans.

Cleo and Señora Teresa walk through the nursery section. They see a crib -

SEÑORA TERESA
You like that one?

CLEO
It’s so beautiful.

Señora Teresa sees the price tag and calls a YOUNG SALESWOMAN over. She comes immediately -

SEÑORA TERESA
What’s your best price on this

crib.

The saleswoman looks at the tag.

SEÑORA TERESA (CONT’D) With my faithful old time customer discount, eh?

SALESWOMAN
Let me ask the manager.

The saleswoman walks up to the counter. The outside din turns into a chorus roar of terrified screams.

It is five o’ seven p.m.
 
101.


CONTINUED:

Ignacio runs through the door, panic in his eyes. Everyone in the store looks at him, confused.

The outside roar intensifies. Ignacio runs to the window and looks out. Other clients do the same. Terror in their eyes.

Cleo and Señora Teresa slowly approach and they join Ignacio to look out the window -

CALZADA MÉXICO - TACUBA

The giant line of students is attacked frontally by more than 100 young men in tennis hoes, T-shirts and short haircuts, armed with 6 foot bamboo canes, clubs and metal rods administering electric shocks.

They are the HALCONES.

The paramilitary group attacks furiously.

The multitude runs, but more Halcones have surrounded them from the back and come out of the surrounding streets.

Shots are heard and a cloud of gunpowder begins to form.
People fall. Women, old men. Children.

INSIDE THE FURNITURE STORE -

Steps can be heard up and down the staircase and a STUDENT comes in, bleeding from the head. He’s not even 20 years old.

The clients cry out in alarm. The student looks at them imploringly and, scared, he turns to hear the noise in the staircase.

The STORE MANAGER signals for him to come in quickly and calls the young saleswoman over.

MANAGER
Put him in the closet.

The young woman rushes the student in to the closet at the back of the store, when -

Three HALCONES appear.

People are terrified. A woman starts crying. Ignacio walks protectively in front of Cleo and Señora Teresa.

The Halcones see the young woman closing the closet door. Two head over, one stays in the middle of the store, controlling the people.
 
102.


CONTINUED:

The young woman places her body in front of the closet door. The first Halcón hits her and throws her on the floor, opens the door and the second Halcón -

SHOOTS THREE TIMES.

The student falls out of the closet, and to the floor where -

THE HALCÓN SHOOTS HIM TWO MORE TIMES.

People scream and the Halcón at the rearguard surveils them menacingly.

Shielded by Ignacio, Cleo sees the Halcón at the rearguard.

The Halcón also sees her.

THEY RECOGNIZE EACH OTHER.

It’s Fermín.

Cleo starts hyperventilating.

The two other Halcones begin retreating and Fermín follows them. The three leave the store.

Cleo watches them go. Her breathing is fast.

A puddle forms at her feet. Her water has broken.


EXT. - STREET - VECINDAD ENTRANCE - NEAR MÉXICO -TACUBA - AFTERNOON

Ignacio holds Cleo and helps her walk. Señora Teresa walks next to them.

Terrified people run in all directions. Shots are fired and there is a lot of smoke in the air.

Students run towards them, terrified, chased after by Halcones with bamboo sticks.

Ignacio pulls Cleo to the entrance of a Vecindad, taking shelter and Señora Teresa follows after them.

In front of them, on the street, the Halcones catch up with a student and beat him to a pulp. They keep going.

Ignacio peeks out at the street, pulls Cleo out and they leave the doorway to continue on their way. Señora Teresa follows after them.
 
103.


CONTINUED:

They walk down Mexico - Tacuba. On the ground, men, women, old and young, lie dead. Some surrounded by pools of blood.

A YOUNG WOMAN cries kneeling on the floor. She holds a young man’s head. Halcones come up and beat her violently.


INT/EXT - ‘64 VALIANT - STREET- AFTERNOON

At the wheel, Ignacio weaves through traffic finding any empty spot he can slide into.

CLEO
Aaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhggggg!

In the back seat, Cleo suffers contractions. Next to her, Señora Teresa holds her hand.

INT - MEDICAL CENTER - CUAUHTEMOC AVE. - AFTERNOON

The ‘64 Valiant rushes down Cuauhtemoc Avenue and turns into the Medical Center entrance.


EXT. OB/GYN - MEDICAL CENTER - DUSK

The building and ramp lights are on against the purple sky wanting to become night.

Ignacio helps Cleo walk. Señora Teresa, slower, follows behind.

On the esplanade, pregnant woman walk around, some accompanied, waiting for their imminent deliveries.

Ignacio and Cleo walk into the building.


INT. - LOBBY - OB/GYN - DUSK

Chaos.

Pregnant woman walk around the lobby while some wait with their family members in the waiting room. Names are called on the loudspeaker and pregnant women are admitted.

CRIES AND MOANS from women going through contractions.

In the reception, nurses efficiently tend to the long line of patients.
 
104.


CONTINUED:

Ignacio enters the lobby holding Cleo. They immediately walk to the reception area. When they arrive, he tells Cleo -

IGNACIO
Wait for me here. Just a sec.

He leaves Cleo and tries to talk to a hurried NURSE -

IGNACIO (CONT’D)
Excuse me...

But the nurse doesn’t pause, she only points -

NURSE
Line is over there...

Ignacio sees the line and Cleo has another contraction, standing.

CLEO
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhaa!

Ignacio yells out to make himself heard on top of the racket of questions, orders, complaints and cries -

IGNACIO
(screaming)

Doctor Vélez! Doctor Vélez!

No one seems to hear him. Ignacio insists -

IGNACIO (CONT’D)
(screaming)

Doctor Vélez! Doctor Vélez!

Doctor Vélez comes in through the medical team and patient door. She hurries to Ignacio -

DOCTOR VÉLEZ
Here, here, here....

Ignacio takes her to Cleo while Doctor Vélez lifts an arm and emphatically calls out -

DOCTOR VÉLEZ (CONT’D)
Nurse! Nurse!

A nurse runs to them, pushing a wheelchair. Señora Teresa has finally arrived. She is completely breathless.

Doctora Vélez reaches Cleo-
 
105.


CONTINUED:

DOCTORA VÉLEZ
Hi, Cleo. How are you feeling?

Cleo looks at her: fear is her only answer. The nurse comes in and helps Cleo sit down on the wheelchair. Ignacio helps too.

DOCTORA VÉLEZ (CONT’D)
I’ll take it from here. You can

wait out there.

Rosary in hand, Señora Teresa and Ignacio look at Cleo being wheeled off through the door leading to -

INT - HALLWAY WITH ELEVATORS - OB/GYN - DUSK

Cleo is in the wheelchair, scared. She is surrounded by Doctor Vélez and the nurses. They reach the elevators and wait.

The elevator doors open and they walk in. The doors are about to close when Señor Antonio, dressed in his white coat, walks up to them and goes in as well.


INT. - ELEVATOR - OB/GYN - DUSK

The doors close.

SEÑOR ANTONIO
Hi Cleo, how are you feeling?

Cleo looks at him, surprised -

CLEO
Doctor...!

Señor Antonio tries to encourage her -

SEÑOR ANTONIO
You’re in good hands... How many
babies have you delivered, Doctor

Vélez?

Doctor Vélez smiles -

DOCTOR VÉLEZ
Hundreds!

Cleo has a strong contraction -
 
106.


CONTINUED:

CLEO
Aaaahhhhggg!

Señor Antonio holds her hand and leans down to bring his face closer to Cleo’s -

SEÑOR ANTONIO
Breathe Cleo... Like this...

Señor Antonio begins inhaling and exhaling and blowing. Cleo tries to imitate him by looking at his face.


INT. - 6TH FLOOR LOBBY - OB/GYN - DUSK

The elevator opens its doors and Cleo’s chair is wheeled out by the nurses. The sixth floor has no windows.

They pass the nurse station and reach the door that leads to the Birthing room. Señor Antonio leans in to Cleo -

SEÑOR ANTONIO
Doctor Vélez will only let me come up to this point....

Doctor Vélez interrupts -

DOCTOR VÉLEZ
Don’t mind me. Come in if you like.

SEÑOR ANTONIO
No, uh... I have a patient...

His excuse hangs in the air and he puts a hand over Cleo’s shoulder -

SEÑOR ANTONIO (CONT’D)
You’re going to be just fine,

Cleo...

And he scurries down the hallway. Frightened and confused, Cleo has barely registered the exchange.

The nurses wheel her into -


INT. - ADMISSION CUBICLES - OB/GYN - DUSK

A cubicle, separated from other cubicles by a curtain and screens, the gynecological bed is in the middle. The nurses help Cleo to get up and out of the wheelchair -
 
107.


CONTINUED:

DOCTOR VÉLEZ
Take off all your clothes and put

on this gown, OK?

Cleo undresses. She doesn’t have much privacy and, behind the poorly closed curtains she can see other women being examined. Doctor Vélez asks her questions to which she answers in confusion.

DOCTOR VÉLEZ (CONT’D)
When did you last menstruate?

CLEO
September?

DOCTOR VÉLEZ
Do you have a due date?

CLEO
June 21st...

DOCTOR VÉLEZ
Were there any complications during the pregnancy?

Scared, Cleo shakes her head no.

DOCTOR VÉLEZ (CONT’D)
How long ago did your water break?

CLEO
About an hour and a half ago. We
couldn’t get out of where we were

and...

DOCTOR VÉLEZ
Was it clear?

CLEO
Huh?

DOCTOR VÉLEZ
The water. Was it transparent?

CLEO
No. A little thick. Like soup.

Cleo is about to close her gown when she suffers a very painful contraction. Doctor Vélez orders -
 
108.


CONTINUED:

DOCTORA VÉLEZ
Don’t push Cleo, blow. Help her get on the bed...

The nurses help Cleo lie down on the gynecological bed. Doctor Vélez touches the top of her belly -

DOCTOR VÉLEZ
Check dilation.

A RESIDENT examines her and declares

RESIDENT
Seven or eight centimeters...

DOCTOR VÉLEZ
Frequency?

The RESIDENT checks on the cardiac rhythm with a Pinard stethoscope while a nurse fills out papers.

RESIDENT
I can’t hear the foetal focus...

NURSE
Blow, ma’am!

RESIDENT
She’s full. She’s in second
plane... expulsive with full
dilation and there is four cross

meconium and asystole.

Doctor Vélez gives a round of instructions -

DOCTOR VÉLEZ
Plug in mixed solution at 5% and wheel her into Labor immediately. Alert pediatrics. Prepare a laryngoscope, reanimation equipment and an ambu.

The nurses quickly bring a gurney up to the gynecological table. The resident asks Cleo -

RESIDENT
Can you climb onto the gurney for

me?

DOCTOR VÉLEZ
Let’s get your baby out.
 
109.


CONTINUED:

The nurses help Cleo move onto the gurney.


INT. - HALLWAY - LABOR ROOMS - 6TH FLOOR - OB/GYN - DUSK

Fluorescent lights in a hallway with half-open frosted doors. The cries of a woman giving brith filter out from one of the labor rooms.

A nurse comes out of one of the rooms and goes into another.

At the end of the hallway we also hear a door opening, and soon after, Doctor Vélez and her team of nurses and residents appear pushing Cleo on her gurney.

When they reach the end of the hallway, they turn and enter -


INT. - BIRTHING ROOM - OPERATING ROOM - OB/GYN - DUSK

Nurses and residents work around Cleo who moans in pain. They put her on the birthing bed while Doctor Vélez washes her hands.

INTERN
Rubén Leñero’s colleague is telling me that they’ve hospitalized injured students and some Halcones came in to kill them off inside the very hospital.

A nurse fixes Cleo’s feet onto the braces. Doctor Vélez sits in front of her legs to deliver the baby.

Cleo has a strong contraction -

CLEO
Aaaaaaaahhhhhh!

DOCTOR VÉLEZ
Don’t blow, Cleo. Push!

Cleo tries blowing in the middle of her cries of pain. A doctor comes in the door accompanied by a nurse who wheels in a cart with medical equipment. It’s the PEDIATRICIAN.

Cleo breathes, agitated. And from between her legs, the baby’s crown appears, like a rising sun.

DOCTOR VÉLEZ (CONT’D)
Almost there... Push!
 
110.


CONTINUED:

Cleo screams.

CLEO
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

It’s a deep cry. A primeval scream from time immemorial.

CLEO (CONT’D)
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhh!

The baby is expelled between Cleo’s legs and onto the hands of Doctor Vélez, who receives it. The baby doesn’t cry or breathe. It is flaccid and hangs like a rag. It’s completely smeared in green liquid.

Doctor Vélez cuts the umbilical chord and passes the baby over to the pediatrician who places it softly on his pediatric table and checks on it with a Pinard stethoscope.

Cleo follows all the action, the pediatric table only a yard away from her face.

PEDIATRICIAN
No heart beat. We’ll try

reanimation.

The pediatrician places the baby in hyperflexed position and puts the laryngoscope down its mouth. He begins aspiration with a catheter.

Cleo sees her baby. From its mouth, through the catheter, meconium comes out, a green dense liquid like pea soup.

The pediatrician pulls the catheter out of the baby’s mouth and places the “ambu”, a manual resuscitator, on the baby’s mouth and nose. Doctor Vélez is working on the placenta expulsion.

Cleo watches the baby on the table. The Pediatrician pumps the “ambu” balloon repeatedly, attempting to reanimate the baby.

Cleo looks at the baby, its face almost entirely covered by the “ambu” and finds out it’s a girl.

The Pediatrician stops pumping the “ambu” and checks for a heartbeat with the stethoscope -

PEDIATRICIAN (CONT’D)
Still asystole...

And he walks over, softly, to Cleo
 
111.


PEDIATRICIAN (CONT’D)
Ma'am. I am afraid you’re baby is
stillborn. She had no amniotic
liquid. And the green liquid
blocked her lungs. I am so sorry,

señora.

Cleo listens in silence, unable to take her eyes off her baby. The nurses start cleaning off its tiny body.

DOCTOR VÉLEZ
I am so sorry, Cleo...

PEDIATRICIAN
Would you like to say good bye to

your baby, ma'am?

Cleo nods. The nurses carry the baby and place it quietly on Cleo, who hugs it, her gaze lost. Doctor Vélez keeps working between her legs, cleaning her.

PEDIATRICIAN (CONT’D)
Who are you with? Can we call

someone?

DOCTOR VÉLEZ
She’s with family. They’re outside.

Cleo whispers something.

DOCTOR VÉLEZ (CONT’D)
Did you say something, Cleo. I

couldn’t hear you...

CLEO
(whispering)

Señora Sofía... Señora Sofía...

DOCTOR VÉLEZ
Yes, Cleo, I will give her a

call...

The nurses come to take the dead baby -

NURSE
May I? Ma'am?

Cleo nods and the nurse takes the baby over to a small table where they wrap her in a cloth.

Cleo watches as her baby girl disappears under the sheath, and when she is completely wrapped, the nurse seals the cloth with adhesive tape.
 
112.


CONTINUED:

The nurse takes a marker and writes on the sheath -

NEWBORN - CLEODEGARIA GUTIERREZ.



Friday, June 11, 1971.

The light of a new day floods the room. Beds in a row along the walls, mothers who have recently given birth are resting.

Some women carry their babies. Others breastfeed. Some sleep.
There are bows, envelopes, flowers.

Cleo is awake, lying in bed. Her gaze is absent.

A nurse carries a baby up to a bed. A woman holds it, excitedly and begins to breastfeed. The nurse helps her, both of them whisper effusively, interrupting the peace in the room.

Cleo doesn’t turn to look at them, or perhaps she can’t hear them, her gaze is lost.

Señora Sofía comes to the door and stops for a moment. She watches Cleo, who is motionless, surrounded by the low hum of barely awakened traffic from Avenida Cuauhtémoc and the breastfeeding woman’s effusive whispers.

Señora Sofía comes into the hall and walks towards Cleo. She sits on the bed and holds her hand. Cleo looks at her, and attempts a feeble smile.

Señora Sofía squeezes her hand as her wounded heart tries to offer solid support that Cleo can’t find in the void.


INT/EXT - GALAXIE 500 - BAJA CALIFORNIA AVE - URES AND HUATABAMPO CROSSTREETS - TONALÁ - DAY

Señora Sofía is driving. Next to her, Cleo. They are silent. They turn right, leaving Baja California Ave behind and with it, the sun.

They drive down Ures, both look straight ahead, surrounded by the purr of eight cylinders changing gears automatically.

They turn left, onto Huatabampo streets. They continue in silence under the shade of the houses until they reach the corner with Tonalá, where a car waits its turn to turn.
 
113.


CONTINUED:

Señora Sofía breaks behind the car and waits. The two women look ahead in silence. Señora Sofía holds Cleo’s hand and starts bawling.

It’s a quiet and prolonged wail that breaks into a long and articulate lament. She hugs Cleo who is still silent.

The car in front of them has moved and now the GALAXIE holds up the traffic, three cars waiting behind it already. A HORN honks.

Señora Sofía cries while hugging Cleo. She cries out all the impotence, all the fear, all the uncertainty, and all the humiliation. She cries, ignoring the chorus of horns that has joined her lament.


EXT.- CORNER OF HUATABAMPO AND TONALÁ - DAY

The Galaxie 500 is motionless and stops traffic at the corner. Impatiently, cars go around it on the left, some of them protesting rudely.

The two women inside the Galaxie continue to hug.



Wednesday, June 23, 1971.

EXT- PATIO - TEPEJI 21 - AFTERNOON

Littered with dog shit, the patio is empty except for a red tricycle, a football and Borras, enjoying the last few rays of sun.

A mysterious WHISTLE filters in from the distance. Alert, Borras lifts his head.

The sad and solitary whistle invokes a presence, invading the walls of the house.

In the patio, Borras begins to bark.


EXT. - TEPEJI STREET - TEPEJI 21- AFTERNOON

The whistle pierces through the afternoon quiet and seems to bounce off the facades of the houses.

Sad and defeated, Tepeji 21 rests on its solid ground, which blends with the grey concrete of the sidewalk.
 
114.


The Galaxie 500 and the Valiant are parked in front of the house.

A KNIFE SHARPENER crosses on his bike, blowing on his whistle, suffusing the air with its ominous lament.

EXT - SMALL PATIO - TEPEJI 21- AFTERNOON

The parakeets seem to want to imitate the whistle with their song. Adela’s voice calls from the second floor -

ADELA (O.C.)
Move it!


INT. - KITCHEN - TEPEJI 21- AFTERNOON

Cleo is sitting next to the window, wrapped up in her own pain.

ADELA (O.C.)
It’s the sharpener! Move it! Cleo!

But Cleo remains motionless.

The fateful whistle fades away slowly and disappears.

Borras and the parakeets calm down.

Everything is in silence.

The afternoon light abates.

Cleo doesn’t move.

TA-TA TA-TA TA-TA TA-TAAAAAAA...!

A car’s nasal horn resounds on the street and Borras replies with his barks.

TA-TA TA-TA TA-TA TA-TAAAAAAA...!

Cleo does not recognize the sound of the horn but its rhythm -

TA-TA TA-TA TA-TA TA-TAAAAAAA...!

Cleo gets up and slowly walks out the door to the -

SMALL PATIO -

She crosses out onto -
 
115.


EXT. - PATIO - TEPEJI 21 - AFTERNOON

Cleo watches Adela open the street door while she grabs Borras by the collar. She discovers -

A PALE YELLOW RENAULT 21 parked in front of the door. It revs and pulls in, easily crossing the doorframe and continuing its way up to the hallway door.

Paco and Pepe peek out from the hall and see their mother at the wheel of the Renault. Paco cries out -

PACO
Toño! Sofi! Come!

PEPE
Mom bought a new car!

Paco comes out to examine the car’s body. Pepe joins his brother. Cleo comes closer while Adela closes the door that leads to the street.

Señora Sofía pokes her head out of the car window -

SEÑORA SOFÍA
You like it?

PACO
How fast can it go?

Señora Sofía opens the door and comes out -

SEÑORA SOFÍA
You check.

Paco hurries to sit in the driver’s seat. Pepe runs around to the other side and sits in the passenger seat.

Toño and Sofi come out to the patio to see the new car.

TOÑO
Why not a Maverick?

From the driver’s seat, Paco protests -

PACO
It only goes to 145! The Galaxie

goes up to 200!

SEÑORA SOFÍA
Because they’re very expensive and I want a small car. I’ve had it up to here with that Galaxie!
 
116.


CONTINUED:

Sofi sits in the back seat -

SOFI
I like the new car, mommy.

PACO
What about the Galaxie?

SEÑORA SOFÍA
I sold it. They’re coming to pick

it up next week.

Sofi comes out of the car -

SOFI
Does dad know?

SEÑORA SOFÍA
No, it’s a surprise.

Señora Sofía looks at Cleo -

SEÑORA SOFÍA (CONT’D)
Hi, Cleo. Do you like the new car?

Cleo barely nods.

SEÑORA SOFÍA (CONT’D)
And speaking of surprises, we’re
going on a trip this weekend and
we’re taking the Galaxie on its

goodbye ride.

Paco and Pepe come out of the car and follow their mother and siblings into the hall.

SOFI
Where to?

SEÑORA SOFÍA
Tuxpan.

PACO
Where’s Tuxpan?

TOÑO
I have practice!

SEÑORA SOFÍA
You’ll skip it. Tuxpan is in

Veracruz.
 
117.


CONTINUED:

From the patio and through the window, Cleo watches the lights of the house switching on and Señora Sofía crossing the hall up to the stairs. Paco and Pepe cross the hall following their mother.

PACO
It’s the beach?

SEÑORA SOFÍA
Yes.

TOÑO
The beach in Veracruz is so ugly.

Señora Sofía climbs the stairs, the four children follow her.

Out on the patio, Cleo watches the family disappear into the upper floor.





Saturday, June 26, 1971


EXT. TUXPAN FREEWAY - DAY

Palm trees, ceibas and banana plants give way to multicolored houses competing with tropical flowers and foliage and more palm trees, ceibas and banana plants.

The Galaxie 500 drives past a turn.


INT/EXT - GALAXIE 500 - TUXPAN FREEWAY - AFTERNOON

Cleo watches the landscape in silence, Pepe snuggles against her.

The radio’s looking to tune into a station, going through tropical music, cumbias, and advertisements for a local dance.

TOÑO (O.C.)
La Pantera doesn’t get all the way here.

PACO (O.C.)
I heard it for a little bit.
 
118.


SEÑORA SOFÍA (O.C.)
Look! The sea!

PACO
Stop, stop, stop! Ma!

SEÑORA SOFÍA
Why don’t we go drop the bags off

at the hotel first?

TOÑO
By the time we get there it’ll be

dark.

PACO
Let’s go! Just for a little while.

SEÑORA SOFÍA
OK. Only for a little bit though.


EXT. - ROADSIDE BEACH - AFTERNOON

The Galaxie pulls up next to the sands of a long grey overcast beach, empty except for the stunted skeleton of a brick building.

The family comes out of the car.

Toño and Paco immediately run to the shore taking off their shirts and pants and throwing them on the sand. Sofi and Pepe follow behind.

Señora Sofía takes off her shoes and follows her children, picking up the clothes strewn about on the sand.

Cleo walks to the shore where the children splash around. She is absent.

A gust of wind drags the breeze over to caress her face. Cleo breathes in the sea and closes her eyes. She breathes in, as if wanting to cleanse something very deep.


EXT. - GARDEN - BUNGALOWS -TUXPAN - DUSK

The fading light of day strokes the garden with soft coolness. An orchard surrounds the bungalows built in the 1940s their paint now nibbled on by time and saltpeter.

A RECEPTIONIST, carrying keys, guides Señora Sofía, Cleo and the children through the garden. They all carry bags. The receptionist opens the door.
 
119.


INT. - ROOM - BUNGALOW - TUXPAN - DUSK

The sky’s last light attempts to paint the windows but is defeated by the lightbulb inside a wicker lamp, which lights the small room with two beds.

Cleo, sits on one of the beds and putting Pepe’s T-shirt on as he stands in front of her with his arms up in the air. When his head pokes out the collar, Pepe looks at her, surprised -

PEPE
Cat got your tongue?

Cleo shakes her head no.

PEPE (CONT’D)
Then why don’t you talk.

Cleo smiles, with a smile that holds back tears, and walks him out of the room to a -


INT. - LIVING ROOM - BUNGALOW - TUXPAN - DUSK

Another wicker lamp hangs in the middle of the little dining room and two lamps on each side of the sofa, one without a shade, light the room.

Toño is tying knots with a string while Señora Sofía is applying vinegar on Paco’s back with a cotton ball.

PACO
Ay! Ay ! Ay...!

SEÑORA SOFÍA
I told you to put on your T-shirt.

PACO
But it was cloudy!

SEÑORA SOFÍA
That’s why! The glare is worse than the sun!

Next to him, crying and crying, Sofi waits her turn.

SEÑORA SOFÍA (CONT’D)
Are you dressed Pepe?

PEPE
Yes, but the cat got Cleo’s tongue.
 
120.


CONTINUED:

Señora Sofía smiles. Cleo sits on the sofa and grabs a cotton ball, douses it in vinegar, comes close to Sofi and starts applying it on her back.

Cleo and Señora Sofía swab wet cotton balls over Sofi and Paco’s backs. Sofi won’t stop crying but Cleo’s gaze is absent.


INT. - RESTAURANT - TUXPAN - NIGHT

Hand-drawn illustrations of each dish and a stuffed sailfish decorate the walls of a family restaurant. Romantic music pours out of a rockola, accompanying the hum of the fluorescent lights.

The family’s finishing dinner. Cleo cuts Sofi and Pepe’s meat. They’re wearing pajamas already. Toño has finished and is tying his knots.

SEÑORA SOFÍA
Children?

But the children are distracted.

SEÑORA SOFÍA (CONT’D)
Children?

She finally gets her children’s attention.

SEÑORA SOFÍA (CONT’D) Pay attention! I have something to tell you.

The children look at her expectantly. Señora Sofía hesitates, gathers her courage and -

SEÑORA SOFÍA (CONT’D)
Your dad’s not in Ottawa.

SOFI
Is he back?!

SEÑORA SOFÍA
No. Your dad never went anywhere.

The children look at her, she’s seems confused.

SEÑORA SOFÍA (CONT’D)
Well, yes. But he only went for a
week and... your father’s not

coming back home.
 
121.


CONTINUED:

The children watch her in silence. Toño and Paco are interested, Sofi and Pepe are confused.

The song ends and the rockola digests another coin, expelling a new lament.

SEÑORA SOFÍA (CONT’D) We came on this trip so he could come get his things from the house.

PACO
What things?

SEÑORA SOFÍA
His things. Or what he says are his things. His clothes, the bookshelves...

PACO
Are you getting a divorce?

SEÑORA SOFÍA
He says he doesn’t know.

Sofi starts to cry.

SOFI
He doesn’t love us anymore?

SEÑORA SOFÍA
Dad loves you very much. He says he wants to see you.

TOÑO
When?

SEÑORA SOFÍA
He says he doesn’t know when...

Soon.

Sofi muffles her cries in Cleo’s breast, Toño looks at the fan and Paco plays with his beans. Only Pepe is still looking at his mother, still confused.

SEÑORA SOFÍA (CONT’D)
There will be many changes, but
we’ll be together and it’ll be an

adventure.

Pepe rests his head on Cleo.
 
122.


CONTINUED:

SEÑORA SOFÍA (CONT’D) I’m starting a new full time job in publishing next week.

TOÑO
Publishing? But you’re a chemist.

SEÑORA SOFÍA
I know, but your father hasn’t sent any money yet and teaching high school is not enough. Plus, I love books and I never liked chemistry. It’ll be another adventure.

But the children don’t look very convinced. They still don’t know this but this moment will be etched into their memories as fragments of images, smells, sounds and textures -

The food stains on the table, the paintings on the walls, the landscape of beans smashed by the fork on a plate.

The song ends.


EXT. - STREET - TUXPAN - NIGHT

The family roams around the streets. Quiet. Lost in thought.



Sunday June 27, 1971.


EXT. - PALAPA - TUXPAN BEACH - DAY

The sun bears down on the afternoon, beaming down on the waves and the burning sand on the empty beach. The waves follow one after another, incessantly, dragging their foam till they caress the sand without ever breaking.

A palapa shelters the family under its shade and its cool sand.

Paco and Pepe bury Sofi in the sand, sculpting long legs to which they add tennis shoes instead of feet.

Señora Sofía reads a book sitting on a folding cloth chair and Toño reads a Flash comic lying down on a hammock, swaying in the wind.
 
123.


At the edge of the shade, Cleo is sitting on a chair, hypnotized by the rhythm of the waves and the foam melting as it touches the sand.

Time trickles by slowly.

EXT - TUXPAN BEACH - AFTERNOON/DUSK

The yellow end-of-the-afternoon light dances with the wind, caressing surfaces softly.

Paco and Sofi play in the waves, jumping over them, swimming under them, or resisting heroically on foot.

In her dress, Cleo stands next to Pepe who is digging holes, tunnels and roads in the sand too.

Señora Sofía comes in to the edge, followed by Toño who stops halfway. Paco and Sofi come out of the water running -

PACO
Are you going to come in?

SEÑORA SOFÍA
I have to go check on the tires since we’re leaving tomorrow early. You coming?

PACO
No. It’s our last day at the beach.

SOFI
I’m staying too.

SEÑORA SOFÍA
But if I leave, you can’t go in. If something happens, Cleo can’t swim.

PACO
But it’s so mellow.

SEÑORA SOFÍA
I don’t care. If you want to stay, those are the rules.

PACO
Not even by the edge?

SEÑORA SOFÍA
By the edge is fine. But just here, understood?

PACO AND SOFI
Yes...
 
124.


CONTINUED:

PEPE
Me too?

SEÑORA SOFÍA
Yes, but right by the shore.

Señora Sofía looks at Cleo.

SEÑORA SOFÍA (CONT’D) Can I leave them with you? I won’t take long.

Cleo simply nods and watches Señora Sofía walk back with Toño to the Galaxie 500 parked behind the palapa.

In the background, the sun has lost its shine and peeks out, red and roundly from between the clouds.

Paco and Sofi go back to the water, Pepe follows.

CLEO
Just right by the shore.

Paco and Sofi run to the edge, splashing around with their feet, getting Pepe wet.

PEPE
Aaaah!

Paco and Sofi kick more water around to get Pepe wet, he runs away but falls on dry sand. Cleo runs to him and picks him up, he’s crying. She tries to brush off the thousands of grains of sand sticking to his damp skin.

Paco takes advantage of the distraction and goes in deeper. Sofi begins to follow in after him when Cleo sees them -

CLEO
Paco! Just in the shallow water!

Sofi!

Sofi obeys, Paco comes back to the shore too.

Cleo takes Pepe’s hand and they walk back to the palapa together. As they step on warmer sand, Pepe stops, holds his arms up.

PEPE
Carry me.
 
125.


CONTINUED:

CLEO
No way. You can do it alone. It’s

not hot anymore.

She looks to the shore -

CLEO (CONT’D)
Paco! I see you! Back to the shore!

PACO (O.C.)
But we’re at the shore!

CLEO
Come closer! You heard your mother, if you don’t come in, you have to get out!

She waits and when she’s satisfied, she keeps walking.

Arms still up in the air, Pepe watches her go and throws himself on the sand.

Cleo barely looks -

CLEO (CONT’D)
Suit yourself. You’re just getting more sand on you and I was going to clean you up in the palapa.

She keeps walking. Pepe gets up, crusty with sand, and hurries to catch up.

They reach the palapa and Pepe sits on a chair. Cleo starts dusting him off with a clean towel. She looks to the sea -

CLEO (CONT’D)
Hey! I’m watching you guys!

Cleo waits for the children to come back to shallow water and keeps cleaning Pepe.

PEPE
Did you know when I was grown up I was a sailor?

CLEO
Mmmhmmm...

PEPE
Yes, and I drowned in a storm.
 
126.


CONTINUED:

CLEO
Mmmhmmm...

She gets up and looks out to sea -

CLEO (CONT’D)
Paco and Sofi! Closer!

Cleo keeps watching -

PEPE
But the waves were so big....

CLEO
Get back!

She walks to the edge of the palapa and stops to wait next to a post -

CLEO (CONT’D)
Closer!

PEPE
And it was night and there was so much lightning... and I didn’t know how to swim...

Without taking her eyes from the waves, Cleo starts walking towards the shore.

CLEO
Stay there Pepe.

The sun has vanished behind the mountain and the purple sky is laden with black clouds. The wind picks up the sand and makes new waves that crash arrogantly into the old ones.

Cleo stops -

CLEO (CONT’D)
Help your sister!

Behind her, Pepe comes closer. Cleo sees him -

CLEO (CONT’D)
Pepe! I told you to stay there!

Chided, Pepe goes back to the palapa.

Scared now, Cleo looks at the sea and looks around but the beach is deserted. Only a man on a horse far away and some people walking in the distance. She hurries to the shore.
 
127.


As she reaches the edge, she walks fearfully in the water that moves back and forth and crashes around her legs, soaking her polyester dress.

She looks impotently at the waves, which Paco and Sofi wrestle, insignificant in a fierce and indifferent ocean that drags them further in.

Cleo tries to move closer to the children, fighting to keep her balance in the choppy waters reaching her waist.

The wind plays with the crests of the dark waves and the dense clouds are charged with tension in an ever darkening sky.

Cleo looks out to the beach but the man on the horse and the people are still very far away and she resigns herself to going deeper.

A wave crashes over the children’s heads. When it passes, Sofi reemerges but she can barely take a breath when another waves comes crashing over her.

Other waves cross and crash up to the sky.

Cleo fights desperately to stay on her feet in the midst of the cross-current chaos enveloping her without failing to look straight in front of her-

Where the waves crash, rising up, and yet others take their place, the little heads don’t emerge.

Another wave powers up and a little head bobs up in front of her, it’s Sofi taking up air, and Paco resurfaces too.

He turns to look and sizes up the wave, grabs his sister and swims with the break to the beach, but the wave catches up with them, pulling them down.

Cleo comes close but is pushed back by the waves. In front of her, the little heads reemerge. Paco tries to repeat the move and pushes Sofi to the front, but the water envelops them.

It also envelops Cleo, but doesn’t drag her out. She pushes towards Sofi, who tries to swim to her. Cleo reaches her body out to get her and as she pulls her in, her feet lose contact with the bottom and the two go under.

Another wave galloping with foam. And behind it, Cleo emerges carrying Sofi. Paco swims behind them.

At the beach, a group of people gathers, and with them the man on the horse.
 
128.


CONTINUED:

Cleo carries Sofi and finally manages to reach shallower waters, Paco follows a little further behind. A couple of young guys run towards them but they don’t help, they just look.

Carrying Sofi, Cleo reaches the shore and collapses on the beach, Paco next to her. Sofi coughs and Cleo hugs her on her lap.

Curious onlookers surround them and behind them, Señora Sofía, followed by Toño come running from the palapa.

Cleo cleans sand off of Sofi’s face and starts crying. She cries and hugs Sofi who is also crying, and rocks with her. Cleo hugs her as if her life depended on it.

Señora Sofía throws herself on the sand next to Cleo and yanks Sofi from her. Sofi hugs her mom. Paco comes to them and hugs them both.

Toño watches, next to the bystanders, and next to him Pepe looks scared.

Señora Sofía checks on Sofi -

SEÑORA SOFÍA
Are you OK, my love?

Sofi nods -

SOFI
Cleo saved us...

The recent emotion pushes more tears. Señora Sofi looks at Cleo who is crying inconsolably. It’s a deep and painful cry, a cry that washes it all away.

Señora Sofía hugs her mightily -

SEÑORA SOFÍA
Thank you, thank you, thank you

Cleo...

But Cleo can’t stop crying -

CLEO
I didn’t want her... I didn’t want her...

Señora Sofía tries to calm her -
 
129.


CONTINUED:

SEÑORA SOFÍA
Shhh, shhh, shhh... They’re OK. The kids are OK....

But Cleo insists amidst tears and snot -

CLEO
I didn’t want her... I didn’t want her to be born...

She breaks down completely -

CLEO (CONT’D)
Poor little girl! ... I didn’t want her to be born! ... I didn’t want her to be born!...

SEÑORA SOFÍA
It’s going to be all right, Cleo...

It’s going to be all right...

The two women cry, hugging. It’s a shared cry, with sobs like retching, and long silences exploding in prolonged vocals.

The children close in on the women, hugging them. Only Toño watches, standing by.

The onlookers scatter. The rider pulls the reins and the horse continues its way down the beach.

The furious sea and its restless waves reflect the last glimmers of the day.



Monday June 28, 1971.


EXT. - PUEBLA FREEWAY - AFTERNOON

Fields spotted with clouds spread out between green hills.
Further behind, the volcanos show off their snowy peaks.

The Galaxie 500 drives on, tiny, on the road crossing the landscape.
 
130.


INT/EXT - GALAXIE 500 - PUEBLA FREEWAY -AFTERNOON

Señora Sofía is driving, and her index finger is calm. Next to her, Toño looks out the window without looking at the landscape. In the rear, Paco also lets the landscape slide by his lost gaze.

Sofi is hugging Cleo, who carries a sleeping Pepe on her lap.

The family rides in silence.


EXT. - FREEWAY ENTRANCE TO THE CITY - AFTERNOON

Mexico City extends out to the distance.

The Galaxie 500 drives on, heavy with uncertainty.


EXT. - HOUSE - TEPEJI 21- AFTERNOON

The house rests patiently, resigned to enjoy the last rays of sun.

The Jr. high marching band turns the corner and heads into the street with its martial drums and trumpets.

The Galaxie 500 pulls into the street and follows the band’s read guard until it parks in front of the house. Toño immediately opens the door and stretches out on the street.

Pepe comes out after him, running to the door, holding his privates and ringing the doorbell. Borras answers by barking.

Señora Sofía comes out of the car and opens the trunk, Sofi comes out after her. Cleo comes out last and heads to the trunk as well.

Adela opens the door holding Borras by the collar. Pepe runs through the door and rushes in.


INT. - DOWNSTAIRS - TEPEJI 21 - AFTERNOON

The afternoon sun still pierces the windows obliquely and streaks the living room shadows with its light. Outside the family is on the sidewalk -

CLEO
Tie the dog ...

SEÑORA SOFÍA
You too, kids. Don’t play dumb and come help us with the things.
 
131.


CONTINUED:

The children who were already walking up to the house stop and come back to help begrudgingly.

Inside, the skylight lights the stairs but barely touches the tiles in the hall. Pepe bursts in from the patio and runs to the bathroom that is under the stairs, goes in, shuts the door.

Adela crosses through the windows that open to the patio, dragging Borras by the collar. She listens to the jet in the toilet.

Inside, the house waits. It seems to have grown larger. The absence of the bookshelves has left towers of books piled on the floor and a seeming emptiness.

Toño comes in, carrying his things. He’s rushing but stops in the middle of the hall, surprised by the space-it seems new. Paco comes in right after and stops next to his brother.

Señora Sofía walks in with Sofi. The toilet flushes and Toño reaches his verdict -

TOÑO
It’s horrible. It’s horrible

without the bookshelves...

PACO
I like it better this way...

Toño runs up the stairs...

TOÑO
It’s awful.

Paco follows after him. Pepe comes out of the bathroom and follows his mother and Sofi up the stairs -

SOFI
What’s so horrible mommy?

SEÑORA SOFÍA
He doesn’t like the hallway without the bookshelves.

SOFI
What bookshelves?

SEÑORA SOFÍA
The ones that used to be in the

hall.
 
132.


CONTINUED:

SOFI
Oh! You’re right!

PEPE
Wow! It looks bigger!

SEÑORA SOFÍA
What did you think about our

adventure?

SOFI
I liked it a lot.

Señora Sofía and the children disappear upstairs, where the television is already on.

Outside, on the patio, Cleo walks, carrying three bags and runs into Adela who is back without the dog.

ADELA
I’m going to the store, there’s no ham. How was it then?

CLEO
Real pretty. Go. I’ll tell you

about it later.

Adela continues on her way out. Cleo comes into the hall.
Crosses and goes up the stairs carrying the luggage.

From upstairs Pepe exclaims -

PEPE (O.S.)
The desk is gone too!


INT. UPSTAIRS HALL - TEPEJI 21- AFTERNOON

Cleo makes it up to the hall and leaves the luggage on the floor. The family has begun to take over the spaces -

Pepe sits next to Paco who is already in front of the television.

SEÑORA SOFÍA
And we’ll have other adventures.

And we’ll travel a lot.

PACO
We’ll go to Dinseyland?
 
133.


CONTINUED:

Toño puts stuff away in a drawer in his room and Sofi goes to her room to grab a doll. Señora Sofía goes to Cleo, takes one of the bags and puts it in her room -

SEÑORA SOFÍA
We don’t have enough money...

Cleo takes the other bag to Toño and Paco’s room. Toño comes out and sits in the armchair in front of the television.

SEÑORA SOFÍA (CONT’D) But we can go on adventures in the car. What if we went to a ghost mining town in the desert?

PEPE
And there’s ghosts?

Paco gets up, following his mother into her room -

PACO
No, silly. That’s what you call
towns that are abandoned. And

what’s over there?

Cleo comes out of Toño’s room carrying a load of laundry and drops it next to the stairs.

Señora Sofía comes out of her room followed by Paco. The phone rings.

SEÑORA SOFÍA
Nothing. Just the town and the
abandoned mine. Or we could go to

the Lacandon jungle, or Oaxaca...

SOFI
Oaxaca, Yes! And we could visit

Cleo’s village.

Señora Sofía comes back to the hall and sits in the couch next to Pepe and Sofi who takes up the other spot.

PACO
I was there.

SOFI
Finders keepers...

Cleo picks up...
 
134.


CONTINUED:

CLEO
Hello? Yes, thank you ma’am... Yes just a moment...

She lowers the phone and calls out -

CLEO (CONT’D)
Señora Sofi? It’s señora Molly

calling.

Señora Sofía gets up, calming the children -

SEÑORA SOFÍA
Don’t fight. You sit here, Paco.

She goes up to the phone -

SEÑORA SOFÍA (CONT’D)
Hello, comadre. How are you? I’m

just back from Tuxpan...

Cleo gathers the dirty laundry into a pile. Pepe calls from the couch -

PEPE
Cleo? Can you bring me a banana

milkshake?

SOFI
Me too?

Cleo picks up the pile of clothes -

CLEO
Sure. Just lemme take these clothes up to wash. Do you want something, Paco?

PACO
Any Gansitos?

CLEO
I’m not sure, but if not, I’ll go

get some later.

Cleo starts to go down the stairs. Señora Sofía continues her phone conversation -

SEÑORA SOFÍA
Yes, it was wonderful... Yes, the kids are all right... No... lovely!
.... good...
(MORE)
 
135.

SEÑORA SOFÍA (CONT'D)
Well Paco and Sofi scared the

living daylights out of me...


INT - DOWNSTAIRS - TEPEJI 21 - AFTERNOON

Cleo goes down the stairs carrying her pile of clothes, the family conversations and television filter down from upstairs.

As she reaches downstairs, she crosses the empty hallway and the breakfast room. She goes into the kitchen and out the back.


EXT. - SMALL PATIO - TEPEJI 21 - AFTERNOON

The patio, in shadows now, floats in the afternoon quiet. Borras sleeps and the parakeets are quiet. Only the hum of the city in the distance.

Cleo comes out of the kitchen carrying her load of dirty laundry and crosses the tiny patio to go up the metal staircase that leads to the roof.

Her steps reverberate throughout the bony structure in a metallic moan that echoes through the tiny patio, waking the caged birds.

Cleo reaches the step in front of her room and keeps walking upwards. A sweet potato vendor lets out his sad howl in the distance.

Step by step, Cleo ascends.

Yet further up, beyond the roof, the sky is pure.
