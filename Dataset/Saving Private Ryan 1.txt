FADE IN:

CREDITS: White lettering over a back background. The THUNDEROUS SOUNDS OF A MASSIVE NAVAL BARRAGE are heard. The power is astonishing. It roars through the body, blows back the hair and rattles the ears.

FADE IN:

EXT. OMAHA BEACH - NORMANDY - DAWN

The ROAR OF NAVAL GUNS continues but now WE SEE THEM FIRING.
Huge fifteen inch guns.

A SWARM OF LANDING CRAFT

Heads directly into a nightmare. MASSIVE EXPLOSIONS from German artillery shells and mined obstacles tear apart the beach. Hundreds of German machine guns, loaded with tracers, pour out a red snowstorm of bullets.

OFFSHORE

SUPERIMPOSITION:

OMAHA BEACH, NORMANDY
June 6, 1944
0600 HOURS

HUNDREDS OF LANDING CRAFT

Each holding thirty men, near the beaches.

THE CLIFFS

At the far end of the beach, a ninety-foot cliff. Topped by bunkers. Ringed by fortified machine gun nests. A clear line-of-fire down the entire beach.

TEN LANDING CRAFT

Make their way toward the base of the cliffs. Running a gauntlet of explosions.

SUPERIMPOSITION:

THE FOLLOWING IS BASED
ON A TRUE STORY

THE LEAD LANDING CRAFT

Plows through the waves.
 
2.


THE CAMERA MOVES PAST THE FACES OF THE MEN

Boys. Most are eighteen or nineteen years old. Tough. Well-trained. Trying to block out the fury around them.

A DIRECT HIT ON A NEARBY LANDING CRAFT

A huge EXPLOSION of fuel, fire, metal and flesh.

THE LEAD LANDING CRAFT

The Motorman holds his course. Shells EXPLODE around them. FLAMING OIL BURNS on the water. CANNON FIRE SMASHES into the bow.

THE MOTORMAN IS RIPPED TO BITS

BLOOD AND FLESH shower the men behind him. The mate takes the controls.

A YOUNG SOLDIER

His face covered with the remains of the motorman. Starts to lose it. Begins to shudder and weep. His name is DeLancey.

THE BOYS AROUND HIM

Do their best to stare straight ahead. But the fear infects them. It starts to spread.

A FIGURE

Pushes through the men. Puts himself in front of DeLancey. The figure is CAPTAIN JOHN MILLER. Early thirties. By far the oldest man on the craft. Relaxed, battle-hardened, powerful, ignoring the hell around them. He smiles, puts a cigar in his mouth, strikes a match on the front of DeLancey's helmet and lights the cigar.

DeLancey tries to look away but Miller grips him by the jaw and forces him to lock eyes. Miller smiles. DeLancey is terrified.

DELANCEY
Captain, are we all gonna die?

MILLER
Hell no, two-thirds, tops.

DELANCEY
Oh, Jesus...
 
3.


MILLER
I want every one of you to look at the man on your left. Now look at the man on your right. Feel sorry for those to sons-of-bitches, they're going to get it, you're not going to get a scratch.

A few, including DeLancey, manage thin smiles. Miller releases his grip on DeLancey who moves his jaw as if to see if it's broken. Miller pats him on the cheek and moves on to the bow.

MILLER

Looks over the gunwale at THE HELL IN FRONT OF THEM.

PAN DOWN TO MILLER'S HAND

It quivers in fear. Miller glances around, sees that none of the men have noticed. He stares at his hand as if it belongs to someone else. It stops shaking. He turns his eyes back to the objective.

THE LEAD LANDING CRAFT HITS THE BEACH

The six surviving boats alongside.

EXPLOSIVE PROPELLED GRAPPLING HOOKS FIRE

From the landing crafts.	Arc toward the top of the cliffs.

THE LEAD CRAFT RAMP GOES DOWN

A river of MACHINE GUN FIRE pours into the craft. A dozen men are INSTANTLY KILLED. Among them, DeLancey.

MILLER

Somehow survives.	Jumps into the breakers.

MILLER
MOVE, GODDAMN IT!	GO!	GO!	GO!

EXPLOSIONS EVERYWHERE

THE GERMANS

On the edge of the cliff. Rain down MACHINE GUN FIRE and GRENADES.
 
4.


THE AMERICANS

Struggle through the surf.	FIRING up as best they can.
Making for the base of the cliffs.

INCENDIARY GRENADES, HURLED FROM ABOVE,

EXPLODE, SPREADING FIRE

MILLER

Ignores the EXPLOSIONS and BULLETS. Uses hand signals and curt orders.

MILLER
THERE!	THERE!	HOOKS THERE!	FIRE
SQUAD, THOSE ROCKS!

THE MEN

Obey instantly.	Set the grappling hooks.	Take position.
Return fire.

THE SOUNDS OF BATTLE

Drown out most voices. Except the SCREAMS OF THE WOUNDED AND DYING.

THE MEN

Know what they have to do. Start up the ropes. Into the teeth of the German defenders.

MILLER

Back-straps his Thompson sub-machine gun. Starts climbing with the first group.

THE CLIFF FACE

The Americans swarm up the ropes. Taking turns firing up at the Germans.

MILLER SEES A STALLED CLIMBER

A soft-faced boy. Grabs him by the back of his collar. Roughly yanks him up. Nearly choking him. They boy climbs on.
 
5.


HALF-WAY

An American Private is HIT. FALLS, taking two others with him. All three land on the rocks below. Another way to die.

NEAR THE TOP

Less steep. They leave the ropes. Free climb, scrambling up the rocks.

MILLER

Joins half-a-dozen pinned down men. Others bottleneck behind them. Miller scans the route and the defenders. Sees an open gap. Deadly. Beyond is a protective overhang. With a clear line to the top.

MILLER
That's the route.

Miller motions to six men huddled near him.

MILLER
(continuing)
GO!

THE SIX MEN

Take an instant to get ready.	Then SCRAMBLE into the gap.

MILLER AND THE OTHERS

Do their best to cover them.	POUR FIRE up at the Germans.
Bad angle. No Germans are hit.

THE SIX MEN

Are CUT TO RIBBONS by MACHINE GUN FIRE. All KILLED. They fall to the rocks below. SARGE, mid-twenties, experienced, Miller's right arm and best friend, dives into the rocks next to Miller.

SARGE
That's a goddamned shooting
gallery, Captain.

MILLER
It's the only way.

MILLER

Turns to the next half-dozen men.
 
6.


MILLER
YOU'RE NEXT!

THE SECOND SIX

Move to the head of the gap. Miller moves for a better angle against the machine guns. Calls to JACKSON, a tall, gangly Southern country boy, sharp-shooter.

MILLER
JACKSON, PICK OFF A FEW OF THEM,
WILL YOU?

JACKSON
(heavy Southern
accent)
You betcha, Captain.

Miller signals others where to direct their cover fire.
Turns to the second six.

MILLER
GO!

THE SECOND SIX

Take deep breaths.	Head into the gap.

MILLER AND OTHERS BLAST SURPRISING FIRE

JACKSON, NAILS a pair of Germans.	MILLER CUTS DOWN two more.
SARGE gets one.	Not enough.

THE SECOND SIX

Are RAKED BY MACHINE GUNS.	All are KILLED.

MILLER

Turns, looking for the next six. His eyes fall on Sarge and REIBEN who is a cynical, sharp, New Yorker. Reiben smiles.

REIBEN
(heavy Brooklyn
accent)
Captain, can I put in for a
transfer?

MILLER
Sure, meet me at the top, we'll
start the paperwork.
 
7.


THE THIRD SIX

Moves into place. Sarge and Miller exchange a look. They both see the madness of what they're doing.

MILLER AND THE OTHERS

OPEN UP on the Germans.

MILLER
GO!

SARGE

Rolls his eyes, takes a breath. Scrambles into the gap. The other five right behind.

IN THE GAP

BULLETS EVERYWHERE.

Three are HIT. Then another. POTATO MASHER GRENADES bounce down. EXPLODE below. THE GERMAN MACHINE GUN swings toward Sarge and Reiben. Miller sees them about to get it...

MILLER STEPS OUT INTO THE OPEN.

A perfect target. Captain's bars glinting. FIRING. TRYING TO DRAW THE GERMAN FIRE.

THE GERMAN MACHINE GUNNER

SEES MILLER STANDING IN THE OPEN. Too much to pass up. He swings the machine gun away from Sarge and Reiben, toward Miller. A ROW OF GERMAN BULLETS approaches Miller...he's an instant from death.

SARGE AND REIBEN DIVE

Under the overhang to safety.

MILLER DIVES BACK TO COVER, BARELY MAKES IT, HIS BOOT HEAL IS BLOWN OFF.

UNDER THE OVERHANG Sarge and Reiben untangle themselves.

REIBEN
I'll be Goddamned!	I'm not dead!

Sarge hollers back to Miller.
 
8.


SARGE
CAPTAIN, IF YOUR MOTHER SAW YOU DO
THAT, SHE'D BE VERY UPSET!

MILLER
I THOUGHT YOU WERE MY MOTHER.

Quick smiles. MILLER AND HIS RANGERS lean out and FIRE. HIT more Germans.

SARGE AND REIBEN run up the path, under the overhang. Stop near the top. Pull pins on grenades. Count. Both throw long, arcing over the crest, perfectly aimed.

THE TWO GRENADES EXPLODE.

Put out the two worst machine gun nests.

MILLER

Crosses the gap.	His men follow.

AT THE CREST

The Americans swarm over the top. FIRING. TWO DOZEN GERMANS FIRE BACK as they retreat. Abandoning the perimeter defense of the bunkers. The Germans are CUT DOWN.

MILLER motions to WADE, a small, wide-eyed, demolition man who's struggling under the weight of half-a dozen satchel charges.

MILLER
Okay, Wade, your turn.

WADE
Captain, I love it when you say
that.

Miller, Sarge, Reiben and Jackson cover Wade as he races to the first of three bunkers. Dodging bullets from inside. Wade tosses a SATCHEL CHARGE into a gun port. A HUGE, MUFFLED EXPLOSION, rocks the bunker.

MILLER AND SARGE

Survey the field.

SARGE
What the hell were you doing?
Drawing fire!
 
9.


MILLER
Worked, didn't it?

SARGE
You tryin' to get yourself killed?

MILLER
Don't need to, the Krauts go that covered.

Sarge shakes his head at Miller, then he looks over the cliff at the scores of men, their shattered, burning bodies covering the rocks and the beach below. He's clearly affected.

Miller coldly glances at the dead and wounded. Then he moves on, leading his surviving men toward the two remaining German bunkers. The SOUNDS OF BIG GUNS and MACHINE GUNS FIRE surround him.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. WAR DEPARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

The SOUND OF CLATTERING MACHINE GUN FIRE SEGUES TO that of CLATTERING TYPEWRITERS. A huge government building stands in the heart of Washington, D.C.

SUPERIMPOSITION:

WAR DEPARTMENT
WASHINGTON, D.C.
JUNE 8, 1944

INT. COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE - WAR DEPT. - DAY

Very busy. A dozen, somber military clerks work behind desks, quickly and efficiently. No small talk.

A CLERK

Older than the others, sad-eyed, adds a sheet of paper to a large pile in his out-box.

CLOSE SHOT

An outgoing telegram. It reads: "We regret to inform you...killed in action...heroic service..." This is the paperwork of death.
 
10.


THE CLERK

Pulls out a file. Reads. Finds something troubling. Quickly shuffles through some other papers. Finds what he's looking for. Rises from his desk and hurries out of the office.

INT. LIEUTENANT'S OFFICE - WAR DEPT. - DAY

Seen through the glass wall. The clerk speaks to a YOUNG LIEUTENANT who is visibly shaken by what he is being told. He motions to the clerk to follow and he strides out of the office with the clerk on his heels.

INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE - WAR DEPT. - DAY

Again, seen	through a glass wall.	The	Young Lieutenant
speaks to a	YOUNG CAPTAIN who, like the Lieutenant is clearly
bothered by	what he's being told.	The	Captain takes the
papers from	the Young Lieutenant and strides out.

INT. COLONEL'S OFFICE - WAR DEPT. - DAY

A busy office. Aides and secretaries scurry about. The walls and tables are covered with maps of Normandy and complex deployment charts. A ONE-ARMED COLONEL with a chest full of ribbons pours himself another cup of coffee. He clearly hasn't slept in a long time. The Young Captain, his staff officer, walks in.

YOUNG CAPTAIN
Colonel, I've got something you
should know about.

ONE-ARMED COLONEL
Yes?

YOUNG CAPTAIN
Two brothers died in Normandy. One at Omaha Beach, the other at Utah. Last week in Guam a third brother was killed in action. All three telegrams went out this morning. Their mother in Iowa is getting all three telegrams this afternoon.

The life drains from the Colonel. Others in the room hear and freeze.

ONE-ARMED COLONEL
Oh, Jesus.
 
11.


YOUNG CAPTAIN
There's more.	There's a fourth
brother.	The youngest.	He
parachuted in with the Hundred-and-
First Airborne the night before
the invasion. He's on the front.

ONE-ARMED COLONEL
Is he alive?

YOUNG CAPTAIN
We don't know.

The Colonel regains his bearings. Stands and motions curtly to the Captain.

ONE-ARMED COLONEL
Come with me.

The Colonel strides from the room with the Captain on his heels. The aides and secretaries watch them go.

EXT. FARM ROAD - IOWA - DAY

A black car drives along a dirt road, a cloud of dust rising behind. Passing through an endless expanse of ripening corn.

EXT. RYAN FARM - IOWA - DAY

A whit farmhouse. A barn. A stand of trees. Cornfields as far as the eye can see.

IN THE YARD

A tire swing. A bushel basket nailed to the barn over a dirt basketball court.

A PORCH SWING

Sits empty.	Moves slightly.

ON THE GLASS OF THE FRONT DOOR

Four American flag decals.	Each one, a man in service.

MARGARET RYAN

Steps out. Around sixty. Her face shows the lines of a life of hard work and mother hood. A good woman.

She wipes her hands on her apron and looks out across the fields.
 
12.


Far in the distance she sees the dust rising behind the black car.

She watches the car get closer, then sees it turn toward her house. She starts to grow uneasy.

As the black car approaches, her breath comes hard. She reaches out and steadies herself on the porch post.

The car pulls up to the house. She sees three men get out, one wearing a clerical collar. The first of her tears come.

INT. GENERAL MARSHALL'S OFFICE - WAR DEPARTMENT - DAY

Another busy office filled with aides and secretaries.
GENERAL GEORGE MARSHALL, Army Chief of Staff, stands next to
his conference table, reading the Ryan brother' files.	Half-
a-dozen subordinates, among them the one-armed Colonel and
the Young Captain, wait.	General Marshall puts down the file.

GENERAL MARSHALL
(softly)
Goddamn it.

ONE-ARMED COLONEL
All four of them were in the same company in the 29th Infantry but we split them up after the Sullivan brothers died on the Juneau.

GENERAL MARSHALL
Any contact with the fourth
brother, James?

ONE-ARMED COLONEL No, sir. He was dropped about thirty miles inland, near Ramelle. That's still deep behind German lines.

General Marshall hardens.

GENERAL MARSHALL
Well, if he's alive, we're going
to send someone to get him the
hell out of there.

That's just what the General's staff wanted to hear.
 
13.


EXT. NORMANDY - CRATER FIELD - DAY

NEAR CONSTANT MORTAR EXPLOSIONS. HEAVY MACHINE GUN FIRE. Miller's Ranger company is pinned down by a superior force of German troops. The Americans hug the bottoms of the craters, FIRING BACK as best they can. BIG GUNS THUNDER in the distance.

SUPERIMPOSITION:

NORMANDY
1300 HOURS
JUNE 9

MILLER

Trailed by a RADIOMAN, dashes through the fire and dives into a sludge-filled crater. He surfaces, sees Sarge and Reiben, and reels from a horrific smell. Their conversation is repeatedly broken by FIRING And DUCKING GERMAN FIRE.

MILLER
Jesus Christ!	What the hell are
we swimming in?

REIBEN
Shit, sir.

SARGE
Fertilizer, Captain, I think we're in a cranberry bog.

REIBEN
Out of the frying pan, into the
fucking latrine.

MILLER
Look at the bright side, the Krauts sure as hell don't want to advance and hold this cesspool.

Miller barks to his RADIOMAN.

MILLER
(continuing)
Get Fire Control, we need some
artillery...

RADIOMAN
Trying, sir.

MORE EXPLOSIONS.	They all duck.	Reiben's worried.
 
14.


REIBEN
Sir, what if they send some other company into Caen ahead of us while we're pinned down here?

MILLER
Don't worry, we're the only
Rangers this side of the
continent, we've got to be first
into Caen.

SARGE
Who cares?

REIBEN
I care.	Don't you know what
Caen's famous for, Sarge?

SARGE
Frogs?

REIBEN
Lingerie.

SARGE
Yeah?	So?

THE GERMAN FIRE diminishes for an instant. Miller, Sarge and Reiben immediately rise and POUR FIRE at the German positions. GERMAN MACHINE GUN FIRE RESPONDS and they duck down again.

REIBEN
So, you ever heard of employee
discounts?

My uncle sells shoes, gets twenty-five percent off everything in the line, got a closet filled with the best looking shoes you ever seen.

MORE MORTAR EXPLOSIONS.

REIBEN
Just picture some French number been spending all day, every day, making cream-colored, shear-body negligees with gentle-lift silk cups and gathered empire waists, what the hell you think she wears at night?
 
15.


MILLER
Reiben, how the hell do you know
so much about lingerie?

REIBEN
Lingerie is my life, sir. My mother's got a shop in Brooklyn, I grew up in it, from the time I could crawl, we carry Caen lingerie, it's the best there is, it's all I been thinking about since the invasion.

Another pause in the German shelling. Reiben rises and BLASTS HIS B.A.R, then ducks as the GERMANS RETURN FIRE.

MILLER
There's a war on, good chance they're not still making lingerie in Caen.

REIBEN
Oh, Captain, they'll always make
lingerie, it's one of the three
basic needs of man -- food,
shelter, silk teddies.

MILLER
Dream on, Private.

REIBEN
Happy to, sir.

RADIOMAN
Captain, I've got Command, they want you back at H.Q., right away.

MILLER
Maybe the war's over.

A MORTAR SHELL EXPLODES VERY CLOSE. After the debris stops falling, Sarge and Reiben rise, spitting out sludge. Reiben looks dubiously at Miller.

REIBEN
I don't think so, Captain.

MILLER
(to Radioman)
Stay at it until you get fire
control.
(more)
 
16.


MILLER (cont'd)
(to Sarge)
Keep 'em down, wait for the navy.

SARGE
Yes, sir.

Miller waits for a pause in the MORTAR BARRAGE, then scrambles out of the crater and takes off in a crouch-run.

EXT. NORMANDY - FIELD H.Q. - 19TH INFANTRY - DAY

Chaos. Under fire. INTERMITTENT MORTARS, SOME BIG GERMAN SHELLS and fairly close SMALL ARMS FIRE.

MILLER

Runs over the broken ground and makes it to the sandbagged H.Q. He stumbles down the make-shift stairs.

INT. H.Q. SANDBAGGED BUNKER - DAY

Sand and dirt falls with the closest of the EXPLOSIONS which continue through the scene. Miller salutes a Major.

MILLER
Miller, Company B, Second Rangers.

MAJOR
Go on in.

Miller goes deeper into the H.Q. bunker where he finds a dozen officers with as many aides, runners and radiomen. Very busy. A field map dominates the center of the small space. The men in the room note Miller, a few nod to him respectfully. He's clearly someone special.

COLONEL SAM ANDERSON is in command, talking on a field-phone. He's about fifty, firm and steady, the calm at the eye of the storm. He sees Miller and motions for him to wait.

COLONEL ANDERSON
(into field-phone)

...I understand your problem, but if we don't get those tanks off-loaded by 0600, we're going to have an entire division up at Caen with its ass hanging out of its pants...

A LIEUTENANT steps up to Miller and hands him a sheet of paper.
 
17.


LIEUTENANT
Captain, here's your company
address list.

MILLER
My what?

LIEUTENANT
For letters to the families of
your killed-in-action.

Miller hands the list back to the Lieutenant.

MILLER
Find a chaplain.

COLONEL ANDERSON
(into field-phone)
...alright, let me know when.

Anderson hangs up, speaks to an AIDE.

COLONEL ANDERSON
(continuing)

Have the Second and Third Regiments hold at St. Michel until we get those tanks.

AIDE
Yes, sir.

Colonel Anderson turns to Miller.

COLONEL ANDERSON
Report.

MILLER
Sector four is secured, we put out the last three German one-fifty-fives, found them about two miles in from Ponte du Hoc.

COLONEL ANDERSON
Resistance?

MILLER
A company, Wehrmacht, no
artillery, we took twenty-three
prisoners, turned them over to
intelligence.
 
18.


COLONEL ANDERSON
Casualties?

MILLER
Forty-four, twenty one dead.

An instant of SILENCE, all hear, none look.

MILLER
(continuing)

They didn't want to give up those one-fifty-fives, sir.

COLONEL ANDERSON
It was a hard assignment, that's
why you got it.

MILLER
Yes, sir.

COLONEL ANDERSON
Where are your men now?

MILLER
Pinned down, a mile east of here, waiting for some help from the navy guns.

COLONEL ANDERSON
I'm sending Simpson to take over for you, the division is going to Caen, you're not coming with us, I have something else for you.

MILLER
Sir?

COLONEL ANDERSON
There's a Private James Ryan who
parachuted in with the Hundred-and-
First near Ramelle.	I want you to
take a squad up there. If he's
alive, bring him back to the beach
for debarkation.	Take whoever you
need, you've got your pick of the
company.

MILLER
A Private, sir?
 
19.


COLONEL ANDERSON
He's the last of four brothers,
the other three were killed in
action. This is straight from the
Chief of Staff.

MILLER
But, sir...I...I...

COLONEL ANDERSON
Spit it out, Captain.

Miller hesitates, then:

MILLER
Respectfully, sir, sending men all the way up to Ramelle to save one Private doesn't make a fucking, goddamned bit of sense.
(beat)
Sir.

The other officers freeze, listening without turning.
Colonel Anderson glares at Miller.

COLONEL ANDERSON
You think just because you hold the Congressional Medal of Honor, you can say any damn thing you please to your superior officers?

Miller considers the question, then smiles.

MILLER
Yes, sir, more or less.

Colonel Anderson looks as if he's about to bit Miller's head off, then he smiles, too.

COLONEL ANDERSON
Alright, I'll give you that.
Continue.

MILLER
The numbers don't make sense, sir. His brothers are dead, that's too bad, but they're out of the equation. Sending men up there is bleeding heart crapola from three thousand miles away. One Private is simply not worth a squad.
 
20.


COLONEL ANDERSON
This one is.	He's worth a lot
more than that.	Which is why I'm
sending you, you're the best field
officer there is.

Miller shrugs.

MILLER
Yes and no, sir, what about
Morgan?	Fine officer, regular
church goer, writes poetry, he
might like a mission like this.
(beat)
And he's taller than me.

Colonel Anderson listens with amused tolerance, but it's time to get back to business.

COLONEL ANDERSON
That's enough, Captain, you have
your orders.	Major Thomas will
fill you in.

Miller knows when to back off.	He salutes.

MILLER
Yes, sir.

Miller and Colonel Anderson exchange a private look.

COLONEL ANDERSON
Good luck, John.

MILLER
Thank you, sir.

Miller joins Major Thomas at one of the smaller map tables. Colonel Anderson watches Miller for an instant, then notices the other officers in the tent watching. A glare and they go back to work.

EXT. BATTLESHIP - DAY

A MASSIVE BARRAGE of fifteen-inch shells BLASTS from the deck of the enormous ship.

EXT. CRATER FIELD - CRANBERRY BOG - DAY

HUGE EXPLOSIONS. The big naval shells SLAM into the German position on the far side of the cranberry bog crater field.
 
21.


IN THE CRATERS

Miller's Ranger company ducks and covers. The BARRAGE SUBSIDES. The Rangers rise, FIRING, leap-frogging from crater to crater, advancing against the remaining Germans who return SMALL ARMS FIRE.

MILLER

Crouch-runs and dives into a crater with Sarge.

MILLER
Put on your traveling shoes,
Sarge, we're heading out.

SARGE
Caen?

MILLER
I wish.	You and I are taking a
squad up to Ramelle on a public
relations mission.

SARGE
You?	Leading a squad?

MILLER
Some Private up there lost three
brothers, got a ticket home.

SARGE
What about the company?

MILLER
Simpson.

SARGE
Simpson?	Jesus Christ on a
fucking pogo stick!

MILLER
I want Reiben on B.A.R; Jackson
with his sniper rifle; Beasley,
demolition.

SARGE
Beasley's dead.

MILLER
Okay, Wade.	Translators?
 
22.


SARGE
Fresh out.

MILLER
What about Talbot?

SARGE
Twenty minutes ago.

MILLER
Damn, I'll go see if I can find
another one.	You get Reiben,
Jackson and Wade, meet me at
transport.

SARGE
Yes, sir.

They wait for a lull in the firing, then scramble out of the crater and crouch-run in opposite directions.

EXT. TRANSPORT H.Q. - NINETEENTH INFANTRY - DAY

Just in from the beaches. DISTANT ARTILLERY AND EXPLOSIONS. Nothing close. Dust. Confusion. Vehicles of every sort moving out. Tanks, half-tracks, troop trucks. In the middle of the mess, a cigar-chewing SUPPLY SERGEANT works at a make-shift desk made out of crate. He yells at a PRIVATE.

SUPPLY SERGEANT
GET THOSE GODDAMNED HALF-TRACKS
OUT OF THERE!

PRIVATE
They're blocked in!

SUPPLY SERGEANT
THEN UNBLOCK 'EM!

SARGE, REIBEN, JACKSON AND WADE

Wait nearby.	Reiben is beside himself, pacing, muttering.
The others are relaxed.

MILLER

Strides through the chaos, avoiding the passing vehicles. He sees his men and walks toward them. Reiben hurries up to Miller, pleading.
 
23.


REIBEN
Please, sir, you can't take me to Ramelle, I gotta go to Caen, sir, please, I told you, they make Caen lingerie there, it's beautiful, it's the best there is, it's...oh, please, sir...

MILLER
Sorry, I need a B.A.R. man, you're the best.

REIBEN
(desperate)
No, I'm not, Kaback is, honest.
Or what about Faulkner?	Or that
little guy with the glasses?

MILLER
Trust me, you're the best.

REIBEN
(whimpering)
But, sir...

Miller jerks his head for his men to follow and he strides off toward the Supply Sergeant's table. Sarge falls in next to Miller.

SARGE
You get a translator, Captain?

MILLER
I've got a line on one.

TRANSPORT OPERATIONS TABLE

Chaos. Vehicles THUNDERING by. The Supply Sergeant juggles runners and paperwork. Miller steps up to him.

MILLER
Sergeant, I need a truck.

SUPPLY SERGEANT
Sorry, sir, fresh out of trucks,
how 'bout a '38 Ford Roadster,
hard-top, red with black interior.

MILLER
White-walls?
 
24.


SUPPLY SERGEANT
No white-walls, sir, there's a war on.
(to the Private)
NOT THERE, YOU GODDAMNED IDIOT,
OVER THERE!
(to Miller)
I can't help you, sir.

MILLER
A half-track, anything.

SUPPLY SERGEANT
Sorry, sir.	Division is using
everything on wheels to get up to
Caen.
(notices Miller's
shoulder patch)
How come you guys aren't going?
Miller ignores the question.	He
spies a jeep.

MILLER
How about that jeep?

SUPPLY SERGEANT
That's General Gavin's.	His lap
dog told me if anyone breathes on
it, I'll get busted and if anyone
so much as touches it with their
little finger, I'll get court
marshaled.	If you were to take
it, they'd shoot me.

JACKSON
Cap'n, does that mean we got to
walk all the way up to Ramelle?

SUPPLY SERGEANT
What's at Ramelle beside a lot of
Germans.

MILLER
A paratrooper named Ryan.	He's
going home, if he's alive.

SUPPLY SERGEANT
Senator's son?
 
25.


MILLER
No, three brothers of his were
killed in action.	Command wants
him out of there.

The Supply Sergeant grunts as if punched in the belly.

SUPPLY SERGEANT
Damn...I got a couple brothers...

Miller looks at him, noting his reaction coldly. The Supply Sergeant shifts his eyes toward General Gavin's jeep.

EXT. ROAD LEADING FROM TRANSPORT - DAY

Miller and his men drive off, fast, in General Gavin's jeep. Sarge is at the wheel, weaving and bouncing through the bedlam of men and vehicles. Miller rides shotgun. Reiben, Jackson and Wade are crammed in the back.

The SUPPLY SERGEANT

Watches them go. Behind him, GENERAL GAVIN, pure piss and vinegar, strides up, trailed by his huge staff. He looks around for his jeep, comes up empty.

GENERAL GAVIN
SERGEANT, WHERE THE HELL IS MY
GODDAMNED JEEP!?

The Supply Sergeant puffs his cigar with a smile and turns to take his lumps.

EXT. ROAD - DAY

Miller and his men weave through the chaos of the American staging area.

MILLER
We've got to make one stop.

Miller points the way for Sarge.

EXT. INTELLIGENCE TENT - DAY

Miller and his men skid to a stop in front of a perfectly white, taut-lined tent. A steady stream of ROARING vehicles and CHATTERING men move out around them. DISTANT GUNS RUMBLE. SPORADIC MEDIUM-DISTANCE EXPLOSIONS BOOM. Miller hops out.
 
26.


MILLER
Wait here.

He strides into the tent.

INT. INTELLIGENCE TENT - DAY

Three bookish corporals hover over map tables like studious nerds the day before finals. They're breaking down and gridding field maps and covering them in plasticine. Tedious, detailed work.

One of them is TIM UPHAM, a thin, twenty-four year old, patrician with gentle, thoughtful eyes behind his thick glasses. He nervously jumps at the sound of a VERY DISTANT EXPLOSION, then he forces himself to concentrate on his work. Miller strides in.

MILLER
I'm looking for Corporal Upham.

Upham raises his eyes from his map and re-focuses.

UPHAM
Sir, I'm Upham.

MILLER
I understand you speak French and
German.

UPHAM
Yes, sir.

MILLER
Do you have an accent?

UPHAM
A slight one in French. My German is clean. It has a touch of the Bavarian.

MILLER
Good, you've been re-assigned to
me, we're going to Ramelle.

Upham knows enough geography to know what that means.

UPHAM
Uh, sir, there are Germans up at
Ramelle.
 
27.


MILLER
That's my understanding.

UPHAM
Lots of them.

MILLER
Do you have a problem with that,
Corporal?

UPHAM
Sir, I've never been in combat.
I make maps.	I translate.

MILLER
I need a translator, all mine have been killed.

UPHAM
But, sir, I haven't held a gun
since basic training.

MILLER
It'll come back to you. Get your gear.

Upham hesitates.

UPHAM
Sir, may I bring my typewriter?

Miller looks at him closely, not sure if he's joking.

UPHAM
(continuing)
I'm writing a book and I...

Miller's expression gives him his answer.

UPHAM
(continuing)
Uh, how about a pencil?

MILLER
A small one.

Miller shoos him off.

MILLER
(continuing)
Go, go...
 
28.


Upham scurries away.	Miller sighs.

EXT. ROAD LEADING FROM INTELLIGENCE TENT - DAY

Miller and his men peel out, now with Upham crammed with the others in the back of the jeep. As they drive off, the CAMERA CRANES UP to reveal the vast tableau of the biggest invasion in military history.

The scope of the operation is stunning. The beach is covered with mountains of supplies. A steady stream of vehicles winds up the dunes. Hundreds of barrage balloons, anchored by heavy steel cables, hover over the entire scene. Off-shore, a massive Mulberry port is under construction, workers swarming over it like ants. Beyond that, thousands of ships and boats of every type and description. The smoke of hundreds of fires rises on the horizon. EXPLOSIONS, some distant, some close, BOOM and RUMBLE.

It's an awesome, breathtaking sight. Miller and his tiny band of men, weave their way through the middle of it, speeding away from the beach, heading inland, leaving the bulk of the American Army behind.

EXT. FRENCH ROAD - DAY

Miller and his men drive fast passing American vehicles and infantrymen moving forward. The sides of the road are littered with the debris of burning German vehicles, abandoned equipment, bodies.

Sarge drives. Miller reads a map. Upham, cradling a pristine M-1 rifle, is all eyes and ears. Jackson and Wade calmly take in the view. Reiben checks out the close quarters in the back of the jeep.

REIBEN
Captain, can I ask you a question?

MILLER
Sure, Reiben.

REIBEN
Where are you planning on putting
Private Ryan, sir?

Miller doesn't raise his eyes from the map.
 
29.


REIBEN
(continuing)

It's just that it's kind of crowded back here, I was wondering if you're expecting to have more room on the way back?

Miller points out a turn to Sarge.

MILLER
Left.

Sarge makes the turn.	Miller folds up the map and pockets it.

MILLER
(continuing)

Now we've got a straight shot, due north, to Ramelle, twenty-six miles, two villages between here and there, St. Mere, then Bernay. We'll take the jeep as far as we can, then go on foot.

SARGE
We in radio contact with anybody
up there?

MILLER
Somebody put the wrong crystals in every one of the Hundred-and-First's radios the night before the drop, not one of them works. We're going in blind.

REIBEN
I usually like surprises.

SARGE
What are we likely to run into?

MILLER
A fucking mess, two maybe three Kraut divisions, no fronts, no lines, the drops were completely fouled up, we've got little pockets of paratroopers all over the place, trying to hang on. Command says we hold St. Mere, but north of that, it's all Krauts. Even if Ryan's where he's supposed to be, he's more than likely dead.
 
30.


SARGE
Hell of a mission.

MILLER
Yep, hell of a mission.

IN THE BACK OF THE JEEP

Upham avidly takes in everything. He notices Reiben staring at him, grows nervous under his look and offers a hopeful smile.

UPHAM
Hi.	So, uh, you're all Rangers?

Reiben, Jackson and Wade look at Upham as if he were an insect.

UPHAM
(continuing)
I'm Upham.
(pointing at his
corporal's stripes)
Ignore these, please, I know all
that breaks down in combat.

Their jaws drop.

REIBEN
(to Wade)
You want to shoot him, or should I?

WADE
It's not my turn.

REIBEN
(politely)
Jackson?

JACKSON
Hell, no, last time I shot a Corporal, Cap'n Miller near bit my head off.

Upham reacts to the mention of Miller's name.

UPHAM
Miller?
 
31.


MILLER
I don't want anybody to shoot him, that's an order. He speaks French and his German has a touch of the Bavarian.

UPHAM
Sir, are you Captain John Miller?

Miller sighs, he knows what's coming.

UPHAM
(continuing)

...who won the Congressional Medal of Hon...?

Upham's words are frozen in his throat by the warning glances of Miller's men. Miller himself remains relaxed but stone-faced.

No one speaks for a few seconds, then the moment passes as if it had never happened.

REIBEN
Captain, I gotta tell you, the
irony of this mission is fucking
killing me.

MILLER
Yeah, how so?

REIBEN
I should be on my way to Caen, sir. It's like Beethoven, the guy's one of the greatest composers ever lived and he goes deaf. Go figure, I mean, who'd he piss off? And here I am, the Beethoven of ladies foundation garments, one step away from Caen, the center of the known lingerie universe and instead, I'm going to Ramelle to save some fucking Private who's probably already dead.

MILLER
There's to be a bright side, look for it.
 
32.


REIBEN
Sir, you know what Ramelle is famous for? Cheese. The rest of the company is going to Caen and we're going to the goddamned cheese capital of France. There is no bright side.

MILLER
There's always a bright side.

REIBEN
I'm listening, sir.

MILLER
Well, I, for one, like cheese.

Wade pipes up cheerfully.

WADE
Hell, I don't mind going to Ramelle, as long as there's something up there for me to blow up.

REIBEN
Well, you're a happy idiot.

THEY ROUND A TURN

Skid to a stop at a:

BOTTLENECK OF AMERICAN VEHICLES

A LIEUTENANT is roadmaster.	Miller calls to him.

MILLER
How's the road up to St. Mere?

LIEUTENANT
Bad, sir. There're some eighty-eights hiding somewhere, knocking the hell out of our traffic.

MILLER
Anybody getting through?

LIEUTENANT
The lucky ones.

Miller nods to Sarge who floors it. They take off, spraying gravel behind them.
 
33.


EXT. ST. MERE ROAD - DAY

The jeep barrels down the road, fast. The road is pock-marked with craters. They pass the wreckage of a pair of American jeeps. Direct hits. Sarge swerves around them without slowing.

AN AMERICAN TROOP TRUCK SMOLDERS

On the side of the road, surrounded by the charred bodies of a dozen American troops. It's a nightmare vision. Upham grows weak at the sight. Miller takes note of Upham's reaction.

IN THE BACK

The men bounce up and down like stuffed animals, doing their best to not be thrown out.

REIBEN
Hell, this is better than Coney
Island!

A HUGE BUMP

Bounces Reiben up and slams his back down on his shovel. He HOLLERS IN PAIN.

MILLER
Just trying to make room for Ryan.

Reiben shoots Miller a smile and shifts his belt, moving his shovel from under his bruised ass.

THEY ROUND A BEND

See a long, straight stretch of road. Half-a-dozen burning, obliterated American vehicles. A gauntlet to run.

AN EIGHTY-EIGHT SHELL SCREAMS IN

Lands right behind them.	BLOWS A NEW CRATER

MILLER
(sweetly)
Sarge?

SARGE FLOORS IT.	Everyone hangs on.

ANOTHER SHELL EXPLODES

Thirty yards ahead of them.
 
34.


MILLER

Directs Sarge off the road.

MILLER
They've got the road zeroed.

SARGE

Yanks the wheel, driving the jeep off the road.

THE JEEP BOUNCES

Off the shoulder. Nearly throwing everyone out. Somehow they hang on. The jeep tears along the rutted field.

ANOTHER EXPLOSION

Just behind them.

SARGE DRIVES MADLY

Not slowing down.	Trying to avoid the biggest ruts and bumps.

ANOTHER EXPLOSION

Close on their side.	Showers them with debris.

SARGE
Jesus Christ!

MILLER SCANS THE TERRAIN

Sees a cluster of buildings about half-a-mile ahead.

MILLER
They've got a hell of a spotter
somewhere.

ANOTHER EXPLOSION

Even closer. The jeep's PEPPERED WITH SHRAPNEL. They BARREL THROUGH the smoke.

MILLER
S-curves, Sarge.

SARGE

Turns shallow curves without slowing down.
 
35.


SUDDENLY SEES A CRATER

Tries to avoid it. Too late. Brakes. PLOWS into overturned earth. STOPS SHORT.

REIBEN, UPHAM, WADE AND JACKSON

THROWN from the jeep.	TUMBLE into the dirt.	Not hurt.

SARGE AND MILLER

Hang on.	Stay in the jeep but are battered.	All stunned.

MILLER

Is first to regain his bearings. Jumps up. Checks out the jeep. Undamaged. Deep in the soft dirt.

AN EIGHTY-EIGHT SHELL SCREAMS IN

EXPLODES THIRTY YARDS LEFT

MILLER
Sarge!	Reverse!

Sarge puts his head back on and throws the jeep into gear.
The wheels spin.	Miller throws his shoulder into the jeep.
Yells to the others.

MILLER
(continuing)
COME ON!	YOU WANNA WALK?

STILL DAZED

Reiben, Wade, Jackson, Upham screw their heads back on. Shoulder into the jeep. Push for all they're worth. The WHEELS STILL SPIN.

ANOTHER EIGHTY-EIGHT SHELL LANDS EXPLODES THIRTY YARDS RIGHT

MILLER IGNORES IT

He's the only one who does.

SARGE
Captain, they got us zeroed.

Upham is very nervous.
 
36.


UPHAM
That's bracketing, right?

They all ignore him.

UPHAM
(continuing)
I know about bracketing.	I read
about it.	The next one is going
to land right on us.

MILLER
FORWARD!	FORWARD!
(beat)
NOW REVERSE!

Sarge SLAMS THE JEEP INTO REVERSE. Rocks it. SLAMS IT BACK INTO FORWARD. Makes progress.

ALL THE MEN PUSH, ALL EYES UP. WAITING FOR THE NEXT SHELL.

SARGE
Uh, Captain...

MILLER
PUSH!

SARGE
Uh, Captain...

THE TIRES SCREAM

A bit more progress.	It's almost out.

THEY ALL PUSH LIKE MANIACS

Knowing the shell is coming any second. Upham is beside himself.

SARGE
(sweetly)
Oh, Captain...

ONE MORE PUSH

The jeep rocks back in, deeper.

MILLER
SHIT!

THEY HEAR THE SCREAM OF THE SHELL
 
37.


MILLER BARKS TO HIS MEN

MILLER
GO!

THE MEN

Instantly take off.	Away from the jeep.	As fast as they can.

THE SHELL SCREAMS IN

The men hit the dirt.

DIRECT HIT

OBLITERATING THE JEEP

THE MEN

Barely out of the BLAST PERIMETER. STUNNED by the concussion. SHOWERED with dirt, rock and debris.

MILLER

Is first up. Sarge and the men struggle to their feet. Hear MORE INCOMING. Miller grabs Upham by the collar and pulls him up.

MILLER
HERE COME THE MORTARS!

THEY ALL TAKE OFF

Running as fast as they can.

THE FIRST OF THE MORTAR SHELLS COME IN

The eighty-eight is big, with pauses spaces between. But there must be a dozen mortars firing. The shells are almost constant.

THE FIELD

The six Americans run madly, in zig-zag patterns through the gauntlet of MORTAR EXPLOSIONS.

BOOM

RUNNING, STUMBLING

BOOM, BOOM, BOOM
 
38.


UPHAM IS THROWN TO THE GROUND

Miller yanks him up.	Half-drags him to the edge of the field.

THEY MAKE IT TO THE TREES

Keep running. Through the bushes and brambles. Thirty yards in.

THE EXPLOSIONS STOP

THE MEN ALL STOP

Panting. Struggling to catch their breath. Check their body parts. Everything's there. They have their weapons, most of their gear.

Reiben looks back through the trees at THE JEEP, which is nothing more than a burning carcass. He shakes his head.

REIBEN
General Gavin is going to be very irritated at you, Captain.

MILLER

Stands on the edge of the woods, almost in a trance.

UPHAM
Captain, I...

SARGE
Sssssh!

Miller, far away, quickly shifts his eyes and ears from position to position.

MILLER
Sarge, maps.

Sarge quickly opens up the map case. The men are dead silent, frozen in place.

MILLER
(continuing)

Two eighty-eights, just under two-and-a-half miles, that way, vector from the jeep, through those two trees at the base of the hill.

The mortars came from behind that rise, there, four of them.
 
39.


Sarge quickly starts vectoring on the map. Miller snaps out of it.

MILLER
(continuing)
Wade, the radio.

Wade instantly starts cranking it up.	Upham is amazed.

UPHAM
You can tell all that, just by the sound, sir?

MILLER
That's not all. There were nine gunners on the eighty-eights, one had a broken heel on his boot, two had bratwurst for supper last night, one of them is named Fritz, the other, Hans, maybe, I don't know, it's hard to tell.

JACKSON
Corporal, you have just seen one of Captain Miller's many God-given talents. If, by some miracle, you survive, you will witness many more of them.

Sarge finished vectoring.

SARGE
Got it, sir.	We gonna go take
care of those eighty-eights?

MILLER
That's not what we're here for.

WADE
(re: radio)
I've got command, Captain.

Miller takes the handset from Wade and the map from Sarge.

MILLER
(into radio)
This is Baker Charley One, fire
mark, sector three, foxtrot
quadrant, four-three by baker-
three.	Two eighty-eights.
(more)
 
40.


	MILLER	(cont'd)
Tell our	boys to	come in low from
the east	in case	the Krauts have
ack-ack.	Good hunting.  Over.

A VOICE ON THE RADIO SIGNS OFF through the static. Wade packs up the radio. Miller folds up the map.

JACKSON
sir, wouldn't take us but a minute to put out them eighty-eights.

SARGE
He's right, Captain, it might be
kind of dangerous for those
flyboys.

MILLER
Tell that to Private James Ryan.
We've got our orders.	Let's go.

Miller heads off without pausing or looking back. The rest of the men don't like it, but they follow. Upham trails, amazed at Miller.

EXT. WOODS - DAY

Miller walks point. His men follow warily. Upham falls in alongside Reiben.

UPHAM
So, where are you from?

REIBEN
Get lost.

Upham smiles lamely and moves on to Jackson.

UPHAM
So, where are you from?

JACKSON
You writin' a book or somethin'?

UPHAM
As a matter of fact, I am.

JACKSON
Figured.

Wade overhears and smiles at Upham.
