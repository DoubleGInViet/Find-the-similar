REIBEN
Fuck Private James Ryan, fuck him, just fuck the goddamned son-of-a-bitch.

JACKSON
Shut up, will you?

REIBEN
You shut up, this is the most fucked up mission I ever heard of. Goddamned Ryan, fuck the little bastard.

JACKSON
Just shut up, Ryan didn't kill
Wade.

REIBEN
The hell he didn't.

Miller motions to them curtly.

MILLER
Keep it down.

They shut up. Miller falls in step to Sarge. Speaks quietly, the men don't hear.

MILLER
(continuing)
We've got to find someplace to
hole up for a bit.

Sarge looks at Miller closely.

SARGE
You alright?

MILLER
Let's just find someplace.

EXT. NARROW GULLY - DAY

Miller leads the men into a heavily overgrown gully. A good hiding place.

MILLER
Rest. One hour. Jackson, Reiben, perimeter. Keep your eyes open. I'm going to re-con.
 
80.


Miller speaks authoritatively and says the right things, but there's something missing. It's subtle. Only Sarge notices. He watches Miller head off into the brush alone.

EXT. SMALL CLEARING - DAY

Miller walks into a small clearing, slows then stops. The life drains from him. He stands there, looking at the dirt, tilting his head, this way and that, as if listening for faint, distant voices. His face shows a battle raging within, as he fights to keep from losing it entirely.

Behind him, Sarge steps to the edge of the clearing and watches. Miller senses his presence, turns and looks at him if he were a thousand miles away. Sarge sits down on a log and waits.

MILLER
What was the name of that kid at
Anzio, the one who got his face
burned off?

SARGE
Vecchio.

MILLER
Yeah, Vecchio, I couldn't remember his name, he was a good kid, remember how he used to walk on his hands and sing that song about the man on flying trapeze?

SARGE
Yeah.

MILLER
You know why I'm such a good
officer?	Because of my mother.
Have I ever told you about her?

SARGE
Bits and pieces.

MILLER
She's the best poker player you ever saw. My father used to go to these Saturday night games and lose his shirt.
(more)
 
81.


MILLER (cont'd)
Finally, my mother gave him an
ultimatum, either she gets a
regular seat at the table or she
locks him in every Saturday night.
He squawked and so did his buddies
but after a while they gave in and
from the first night she sat down,
she never lost.	She could read
those cocky bastards like they
were playing open hands.	And he
bluffs?	He had sixteen levels of
bullshit.	Her eyes, the tone of
her voice, her bets, her jokes,
the way she sipped her coffee, she
was a master.	She won more money
on shit hands than anyone in the
history of the game. Every
Saturday night, my father would
lose two, three hundred bucks and
she'd win it all back and then
some.	And I'd stand there, glued
to her shoulder, from the time I
was five years old, watching every
hand, every move, studying how she
did it.
(beat)
That's why I'm such a good
officer, I can look at a man's
face and tell you exactly what
he's holding, and if it's a shit
hand, I know just what cards to
deal him.

SARGE
And what about your own hand?

MILLER
No problem. A pair of deuces? Less? So what? I bluff. It used to tear me apart when I'd get one of my men killed, but what was I supposed to do? Break down in front of the ones who were standing there waiting for me to tell them what to do? Of course not, so I bluffed, and after a while, I started to fall for my own bluff. It was great, it made everything so much easier.
 
82.


SARGE
Is that why your hand's been
shaking?

MILLER
It could be worse.	You know the
first thing they teach you at
O.C.S.? Lie to your men.

SARGE
Oh, yeah?

MILLER
Not in so many words, but they tell you you can have all the firepower in the world and if your men don't have good morale, it's not worth a damn. So if you're scared or empty or half-a-step from a Section Eight, do you tell your men? Of course not. You bluff, you lie.

SARGE
And how do you bluff yourself?

MILLER
Simple, numbers. Every time you kill one of your men, you tell yourself you just saved the lives of two, three, ten, a hundred others. We lost, what, thirty-one on the cliffs? I'll bet we saved ten times that number by putting out those guns. That's over three hundred men. Maybe five hundred. A thousand. Then thousand. Any number you want. See? It's simple. It lets you always choose mission over men.

SARGE
Except this time, the mission IS
a man.

MILLER
That's the rub. I liked Wade. Who's Ryan? If they're both standing in front of me and I have to shoot one or the other, how do I choose? Look at my hand, there it goes again.
 
83.


SARGE
John, I've got to tell you, I
think you're about used up.

MILLER
I think you're right, Keith.

SARGE
You want me to take over?

The question helps Miller pull himself back together. He looks at his hand and forces it to stop shaking again.

MILLER
No, but if I get any worse, you'll have to relieve me.

SARGE
(sighs)
Just what I want to do.

They share a smile.

MILLER
You know Wade was the eleventh of the twelve, you're the last one still alive.

SARGE
I know.

MILLER
Don't let yourself get killed, if you do, they might make me give back the medal and then I won't be able to lip off to colonels anymore.

SARGE
I'll do my best.

They shake their heads at the madness of it all.

MILLER
Hell of a...
(beat)
Ah, forget it.

Miller picks up his Thompson and looks around, re-orienting himself. He's about ninety-five percent there.
 
84.


MILLER
(continuing)
Thanks for drawing that machine
gun off me.

SARGE
You're welcome, John.

MILLER
But, that's my personal brand of stupidity, I feel kind of proprietary about it, if you do it again, you're busted.

Sarge allows himself a slight smile.

SARGE
Yes, sir.

Miller jerks his head for Sarge to follow. They head back to the men.

EXT. CLEARING - DAY

The men are all in their private worlds, thinking of Wade.
No talk. Miller and Sarge walk back into the clearing.
Miller barks at the men.

MILLER
Up. We're moving out.

REIBEN
I thought you said we had an hour, sir?

MILLER
Well now I'm saying we're moving
out.	Get off your ass.

The men get up.	Jackson is a bit slow.

MILLER
(continuing)
What the hell's the matter with
you, Jackson?

JACKSON
Sir, I ain't feeling so chipper on account of Wade.

MILLER
Who's Wade?
 
85.


No one responds.

MILLER
(continuing)
I said, who the hell is Wade?

The men exchange looks.	Jackson speaks for them.

JACKSON
Sir, I understand what you're doin', but I respectfully request permission to grieve in my own manner.

MILLER
You'll grieve the way I tell you to goddamned grieve. There is no Wade, there was one, but he died a long time ago, he's been dead for so long you can hardly remember his name, you understand?

JACKSON
Sir, I understand.	I don't like
it, but I understand.

MILLER
Good, now get your goddamned gear.

The men pick up their equipment and prepare to move out. Sarge and Miller exchange a silent look. Miller shakes his head to himself, amazed that the men still allow this shit to work. He knows they have no choice.

EXT. FRENCH ROAD - DAY

Miller and his men walk along the road. The men are silent, grim.

EXT. FRENCH PATH - DAY

Miller checks his map. figures out where they are. Folds up the map, points the way and they move out.

EXT. FRENCH FIELD - DAY

More progress.	The men are still grim.

REIBEN
You know what the best possible
thing that could happen is?
 
86.


JACKSON
Yep, you step on a rusty nail, get lockjaw, never say another word as long as you live.

Miller laughs.

MILLER
I'll bite, Reiben.

REIBEN
I've given this a lot of thought, sir. The best thing that could happen is, we find Ryan and he's dead.

MILLER
Why's that?

REIBEN
Well, sir, consider the possibilities. A: Ryan is alive. We have to take him back to the beach. Knowing you, you don't let him carry my gear, even though he really should, and we all get killed, trying to keep him alive.

MILLER
Except for the last part, that
one's not bad.

REIBEN
B:	Ryan is dead. He's been blown up by the German equivalent of Wade, whose name I know you don't want me to mention. There's nothing to find. The biggest piece is the size of a pea. We wander around, looking for him until the Germans pick us off, one after another.

MILLER
I don't like that one.

REIBEN
Neither do I, sir. C: And this is the worst one, we find Ryan and he's wounded. Not only does he not carry my gear, we have to carry his gear. And him.
 
87.


MILLER
But we accomplish the mission.

REIBEN
Maybe. But what if he dies on the way back? you see what I'm saying, sir? The best possible situation is, he's dead, we find his body, more or less intact, we grab one of his dog-tags and high-tail it back to the beach, or better yet, we head over to Caen and catch up with division.

MILLER
Has anyone ever told you, you're
officer material?

REIBEN
No, sir.

MILLER
That's a mystery to me.

No one smiles, but they trudge a bit less.

EXT. CROSSROADS - DAY

The SOUND OF HEAVY FIRING. Miller checks a map in the brush near the crossroads. A sign reads: "Ramelle 3 Km." Miller folds up the map.

SARGE
Looks like we're going to beat those Kraut companies to Ramelle.

Suddenly Miller stops dead. He listens, hearing something the others don't hear. He motions for them to freeze, they do. The SOUND grows louder. It's an OMINOUS RUMBLE.

MILLER
I don't think so.

EXT. FRENCH ROAD - DAY

THE RUMBLE turns into the ROAR OF A BIG GERMAN CONVOY. Troop trucks, armored personnel carriers, a regiment of crack Wehrmacht troops. Heavily armed. Imposing. Crossing a bridge.
 
88.


CAMERA PANS DOWN TO REVEAL

Miller and his men crowded into a culvert under the bridge.
Brush and debris partially shield the ends of the culvert.

GERMAN FLANK SQUADS

Hurry along the fields on either side of the road, trying to keep up with the vehicles.

MILLER AND HIS MEN

Catch a glimpse of an approaching German Flank Squad. They flatten themselves into the mucky water. Ready their weapons. Prepare to fire.

THE GERMAN SQUAD

Approaches the bridge.

A PAIR OF GERMAN PRIVATES

See the culvert obscured by brush.	Move to check it out.

MILLER

Is just about to open up on them.

THE GERMAN SERGEANT

Sees his Flank Squad lagging behind and CALLS to them.

THE GERMAN PRIVATES

Obey.	Hurry after the rest of the convoy.

IN THE CULVERT

The Americans breathe again.

UPHAM
I wonder where they're going.

MILLER
Same place we are.

Jackson, at the mouth of the culvert, motions that the coast is clear. They head out.
 
89.


EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF RAMELLE - DAY

A gently-sloped valley with scattered farm cottages and small, cultivated fields, bordered by ancient, moss-covered stone walls. The twos is visible beyond.

Miller and his men crouch-run to the cover of one of the stone walls. Miller pulls out his binoculars.

ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE FIELD

There's a large gathering of German troops and vehicles.

MILLER

Scans the Germans with his binoculars.

REIBEN
Looks like tea time, maybe they're
Brits.

UPHAM
I sure hope so.

SARGE
What do you think they're waiting for, Captain?

Just then they hear an OMINOUS RUMBLE, deeper and more threatening that that of the convoy. The sound gets LOUDER and LOUDER. Miller and his men exchange looks. They know that sound, they don't like it.

FOUR MASSIVE GERMAN TANKS

Appear down the road, heading for the German soldiers who greet them enthusiastically. The tanks are tigers, huge, far bigger than an American Sherman. Each one, sixty-two tons, with a big 88-mm gun, four heavy machine guns and impregnable armor. Each one, an infantryman's nightmare. There are four of them.

MILLER

Puts away the binoculars and jerks his head for his men to follow, low, along the wall. The men are happy to do so, looking back nervously at the German tanks.
 
90.


EXT. TOWN SQUARE - RAMELLE - DAY

The SOUNDS OF SPORADIC SMALL ARMS FIRE. The town square is a deserted battlefield, littered with burning debris, shell casings and bodies, German and American and a few French civilians.

Miller and his men enter the square, weapons ready, leap-frogging from doorway to doorway.

Miller and Sarge crouch-run to the cover of some overhanging debris. They listen, trying to pinpoint the exact source of the firing.

Sarge motions his guess. Miller nods in agreement. He signals for the men to follow him around, not toward, the firing.

They move on, dashing from cover to cover.

EXT. BRIDGE - RAMELLE - DAY

A dozen AMERICAN PARATROOPERS on the bridge exchange SPORADIC FIRE with a few German snipers hidden in the buildings near the bridgehead. The bridge has clearly been the scene of heavy fighting. Craters, burning debris and shell casings are everywhere. The bridge is intact, only slightly damaged. There are dozens of German bodies along the riverbank on both sides of the bridge.

MILLER AND HIS MEN

Crouch-run and take cover as they get within sight of the bridge.

REIBEN
Looks like they've been having a
hell of a party, here, Captain.

MILLER
ON THE BRIDGE!	WE'RE COMING IN.

A YOUNG BUT GRIZZLED VOICE calls back.

VOICE FROM BRIDGE
KISS MY ASS, FRITZ.

MILLER
YOU FIRE AT US AND I'LL DO A HELL
OF A LOT MORE THAN THAT.
 
91.


VOICE FROM BRIDGE
WHO WON THE '38 ARMY-NAVY GAME?
 

Miller turns to his men.
 


They all come up empty.

 

MILLER
I HAVE NO FUCKING IDEA.	HERE WE
COME.
(to his men)
Cover me.

REIBEN
What if our guys open up, sir?

MILLER
You're only allowed to shoot at
Germans, that's one of the rules.

REIBEN
Have it your way, Captain.

Miller takes a breath, then DASHES out into the open, toward the bridge.

THE GERMAN SNIPERS OPEN UP

Bullets SMASH INTO THE GROUND around Miller.

MILLER'S MEN

POUR FIRE at the German positions, SURPRESSING THE GERMAN FIRE.

ON THE BRIDGE

The Paratroopers pour a HEAVY STREAM OF BULLETS at the German positions.

Miller makes it to the bridge and DIVES over a defensive jumble of crates, sandbags and bodies.

He finds himself next to SERGEANT BILL FORREST who was the young but grizzled voice that called out. With Forrest are some very worn-out, young AMERICAN PARATROOPERS. Miller catches his breath.

FORREST
Navy, sir, twenty-one to nineteen. They won on a field goal in overtime.
 
92.


MILLER
I'll keep it in mind.
(calls to Sarge)
OKAY, SARGE, ONE AT A TIME.

Miller and the paratroopers FIRE COVER for Miller's men as they come in. Miller and Forrest alternately take and FIRE.

FORREST
Are we glad to see you, sir, we were supposed to hold this bridge for twenty-four hours, it's been six days.

MILLER
Things are tough all over. We're looking for a Private James Ryan.

FORREST
Ryan?

MILLER
Is he here?

Forrest motions to one of the paratroopers.

FORREST
Go get Ryan.
(to Miller)
What do you want him for, sir?

Miller doesn't answer. Jackson leaps over the barricade and scrambles to them.

MILLER
Jackson, get a hold of command.

Jackson cranks up the five-thirty-five. Miller turns to Forrest.

MILLER
(continuing)
How many men do you have?

They pause to FIRE, covering Sarge, the last of Miller's men to leap over the barricade.

FORREST
Eleven, sir.	We started with
thirty-six.
(more)
 
93.


FORREST (cont'd)
The bridge was easy to take but the Krauts have been coming back at us ever since. They must want it intact or we'd be long gone.

Jackson speaks into the radio handset, repeating Miller's hailing I.D. No response.

JACKSON
Not yet.

MILLER
Keep trying.

FORREST
Sir, what do you want with Ryan?

Miller doesn't answer, he looks past Forrest and sees:

PRIVATE JAMES RYAN

Dashing from cover to cover, making his way toward them. Ryan is an American classic, nineteen years old, earthy, handsome, sharp, cocky. Though he's exhausted, unshaven, and smeared with dirt and blood, he's very alive. His eyes shine, his face has a spark. You can't help but love this kid.

MILLER'S MEN

All watch Ryan run toward them.

JACKSON
So, that's Ryan.

REIBEN
Looks like a flaming asshole to me.

Their eyes remain glued to Ryan as he makes it to the barricade. He salutes Miller.

RYAN
I'm Ryan, sir. You wanted to see me?

Miller looks at Ryan for a moment, amazed that he's finally face-to-face with him. Ryan waits. Miller hesitates, searching for words. Then he speaks gently but clearly.
 
94.


MILLER
Private, I've got some bad news for you. Your brothers have been killed in action.

The life instantly drains from Ryan.	His breath comes hard.
Somehow he remains upright.

RYAN
All three?

MILLER
Yes.

Ryan sways. Miller grabs him and eases him back, leaning him against some sandbags.

THE PARATROOPERS

Are stunned at the news. They look at Ryan, there's nothing else they can do.

MILLER'S MEN

Also look at Ryan, but then, one after another, they turn away, adverting their eyes, looking a their own boots, the debris on the bridge, the sky, anything other than Ryan.

MILLER
We've been sent to get you out of here. You're going home.
 

Ryan weakly waves Miller off.
the paratroopers to move away.
little room.
 


Miller motions to his men and They do so, giving Ryan a

 

FORREST
Three brothers, the poor son-of-a-bitch.

MILLER
Sergeant, we're moving out and I'm taking you and your men with me.

FORREST
But, sir, our orders are clear, we're to hold this bridge until we're relieved by forward elements of the Twenty-ninth Division.
 
95.


MILLER
I'm giving you new orders,
Sergeant.

FORREST
Sir, you can't do that, these
orders are from command.

MILLER
I'm not going to leave you and your men here to get killed. Get them together, we're moving out.

A VOICE from behind them speaks simply, clearly, firmly.

RYAN (O.S.)
No, sir.

They all turn and see Ryan standing there. Miller is about to automatically rip Ryan a new asshole for contradicting him, but he quickly calms himself, gently touches Ryan on the arm and speaks softly to him.

MILLER
Come on, Private, you're going
home.

Ryan jerks away from Miller.

RYAN
No, sir.

All eyes are on Miller and Ryan.	Miller remains patient.

MILLER
Private.	I'm sorry about your
brothers but staying here and
getting yourself killed isn't
going to help.

RYAN
Sir, if the Krauts are holding
this bridge when division shows
up, our guys are going to be
sitting ducks.

MILLER
This bridge cannot be held. The Germans have two companies less than three miles from here. They have tanks.
 
96.


That news clearly affects Ryan and the other paratroopers, but Ryan holds his ground.

RYAN
Sir, I'm still not going.

Miller speaks with restrained, but growing, anger.

MILLER
Private, if you want to commit suicide, that's your choice, but you're going to have to wait until after I get you back to the beach. And you're not going to take these men with you.

Ryan stands eye-to-eye with Miller.

RYAN
I'm not leaving, sir.

Miller starts to boil over.

MILLER
The hell you aren't, you're comin' with me if I have to drag you every inch of the way. You hear me, Private?

RYAN
I hear you sir, but I'm not
leaving.

Miller grabs Ryan by the lapels and shakes him. Ryan doesn't resist.

MILLER
Listen you little son-of-a-bitch
you're coming with me or
I'll...I'll...

Ryan speaks softly.

RYAN
What are you going to do, sir,
shoot me?

Miller considers it. Then REIBEN SPEAKS UP from behind Miller.
 
97.


REIBEN
(politely)
Uh, excuse me, Captain.

Miller slowly turns and glares.

REIBEN
(continuing;
continuing)
So, what are a few tanks, sir?

Miller's more amazed than pissed off.	Reiben smiles.

REIBEN
(continuing)
He's right, we can't shoot

him...well, we could but we'd get in an enormous amount of trouble. And he's right about the bridge, it's a hell of a lot more important than he is.

JACKSON STEPS FORWARD.

JACKSON
Cap'n...?

Miller turns his glare on Jackson.

JACKSON
(continuing)
Seems to me, we got us a
opportunity, here, to kill two
birds with one stone.	Command
seems to think keepin' this boy
alive is worth somethin'.	If we
was to do that and hold this
bridge, good chance we'd get us a
bucket full of medals.	I might
even get me one 'a them big, fancy
ones like you got, so's I could
sass any officer in the whole dang
army, you included.

Miller does a slow burn.

UPHAM STEPS FORWARD

UPHAM
I'd like to stay, too, Captain.
 
98.


MILLER
You don't count.

SARGE STEPS UP

SARGE
I do and personally, I'd rather
get the hell out of here, but
somebody's got to stay and take
care of you and these pin-head
privates of yours.

Miller looks at FORREST AND THE PARATROOPERS.

FORREST
We weren't planning on going
anywhere, sir.

Reiben smiles.

REIBEN
See, Captain?	The vote's
unanimous.

Miller's eyes almost pop out of his head.

MILLER
The vote?	What the hell are you
talking about?	We don't vote.
This isn't a democracy.	This is
the army, I give orders, you
follow them. We don't vote!

REIBEN
Yes, sir, of course, sir, I was merely speaking hypothetically. IF this was a voting situation, then the vote would have been unanimous. But of course, it's not a voting situation, you're the Captain, and you give the orders, sir.

MILLER
You're goddamned right, I give the order. Vote! Jesus Christ! Listen to me, you little pissant pieces of shit, I am the ranking officer here and what I say goes, is that clear?

They all quickly nod.
 
99.


JACKSON
Yes, sir.

REIBEN
Of course, sir.

ALL THE OTHERS
Yes, sir.	Yes, sir.

Miller looks from face to face.

MILLER
In that case...
(beat)
I vote we stay.

That's what they wanted to hear. Miller doesn't give them time to enjoy it, he immediately starts barking orders.

MILLER
(continuing)
Reiben, the B.A.R., there.
Jackson, get up on the
bridgekeepers hut with your sniper
rifle.	Sarge, you and Upham move
that machine gun so it can cover
the left flank, it's worthless
where it is.	Forrest, I want a
full inventory of all your
weapons, ammo and ordnance.	Go.

They all hurry off, except for Ryan who locks eyes with Miller for a moment.

RYAN
Thank you, sir.

MILLER
(gruffly gentle)

Yeah, yeah. I want you right next to me, no matter where I go, you understand?

Ryan salutes.

RYAN
Yes, sir.

MILLER
Alright, come with me.
 
100.


Miller shakes his head at himself and strides off to check the defensive perimeter with Ryan at his side.

EXT. BRIDGE - DAY

Miller and Reiben watch as Forrest, Ryan and a couple other paratroopers lay out their weapons and ammo inventory.

FORREST
Two machine guns, twenty-two grenades, two Gammon grenades, six satchel charges, twenty-six M-1's, eight Tommy guns and about sixty rounds per man.

MILLER
That's it?

Reiben looks at the sparse array of weaponry.

REIBEN
Sir, can I change my vote?

Miller sighs, worried.

EXT. BRIDGEKEEPER'S HUT - DAY

Jackson, perched on the bridgekeepers hut, protected by a crescent of sandbags. His eye is at his scope. He FIRES.

A GERMAN SNIPER

Falls from a window on the edge of town, dead.

UPHAM

Sits beside Jackson with a pair of binoculars, searching for another target. The German sniper fire has subsided for now.

EXT. BRIDGE - DAY

Miller watches as Ryan and several other paratroopers dig a series of trenches across the street, leading to the bridge.

Reiben, Jackson and Upham, stone-faced, watch Ryan.

Miller eyes the buildings near the bridge head. He speaks to Sarge who holds several satchel charges.

MILLER
Sarge, see what you can do to make those buildings inhospitable.
 
101.


SARGE
Yes, sir.

Just then they hear the sound of A BIG GUN FIRING IN THE DISTANCE. They all turn at the sound.

UPHAM
Eighty-eights, right?

Miller nods.

UPHAM
(continuing)
I can tell what the gunners had
for dinner.

MILLER
Those guns are close.

FORREST
Just south of town. The Krauts have a two gun emplacement, we saw it on the way in. That's how we knew they wanted the bridge intact, they didn't blow the crap out of us.

MILLER
Let's hope they don't change their mind.

Upham listens to the eighty-eights with particular interest.

INT. BUILDING - DAY

Within sight of the bridge. Sarge carefully plants a wire-triggered satchel charge at the door of the building. He sets the wire, then carefully backs away.

EXT. BRIDGE - EVENING

Reiben and Ryan pile sandbags, finishing a forward machine gun nest. Miller looks around, evaluating, Sarge and Upham at his side.

SARGE
What do you think?
 
102.


MILLER
Well, if we had ten times the men and a lot more ammo, we might stand a chance, but not against those tanks.

SARGE
What are we going to do?

MILLER
We're going to hope like hell the tanks were on their way somewhere else.

REIBEN
Maybe Caen.

MILLER
Let's hope, because we're sure as hell not going to do any damage to them with what we have here.

UPHAM
What about our grenades?

MILLER
Those are Tigers, they have six-inch armor, they don't even notice grenades.

UPHAM
Would they notice and eighty-eight?

MILLER
Sure, you got one?

UPHAM
The Germans do.

Miller is stone-faced, then he smiles.

MILLER
Upham, go find Jackson, he and I
are going hunting.

Upham runs off.	Sarge shakes his head.

SARGE
Uh, oh.

MILLER
Out of the mouth of babes.
 
103.


EXT. BRIDGEHEAD - NIGHT

Dark. Miller, Jackson and Forrest darken their faces with blackening soot. The rest of Miller's men and several paratroopers, including Ryan, look on. Upham is distressed.

UPHAM
It was my idea, sir, you've got to let me go.

MILLER
Upham, you've got to learn the
difference between whining and
griping. You can't just rely on
natural ability, you've got to
study and practice.

UPHAM
But, sir...

MILLER
There you go again, that's
whining, that's not okay.

UPHAM
Goddamn it, sir...

MILLER
That's better, but you've still
got a long way to go.	Talk to
Reiben, he's a natural and works
at it, he'll give you some
pointers.

REIBEN
Leave him to me, Captain, I'll have him pissing and moaning with the best of us.

MILLER
See to it.

RYAN steps up to Miller.

RYAN
I'd like to go, sir.

MILLER
No, Private, I want you to stay
here, keep your head down, don't
do anything brave or stupid.
 
104.


REIBEN
Aren't they the same thing, sir?

Miller smiles.

MILLER
Reiben, I don't know what I'd do
without you.	Sarge, keep Ryan
close to you and alive.

SARGE
Yes, sir.

Miller checks Jackson and Forrest.

MILLER
You ready?

FORREST
Yes, sir.

JACKSON
You betcha, sir.

Miller, Forrest and Jackson prepare to move out.

REIBEN
(southern accent)
Y'all come back.

JACKSON
Reiben, are you makin' fun 'a the way I talk?

REIBEN
(heavy southern
accent)
Hell, no!

Jackson shoots him a glare, then he follows Miller and Forrest into the darkness. Sarge, Ryan and the other watch them go.

EXT. GERMAN EIGHTY-EIGHT EMPLACEMENT - NIGHT

A German eighty-eight FIRES, sending its big shell into the night. It's eight-man crew re-loads.

IN THE DARKNESS

A slight movement. It's Miller. He crawls to the edge of the emplacement and freezes in the shadows.
 
105.


A moment later he's joined by Forrest. A moment after that, Jackson silently crawls up to them.

MILLER

Eyes the emplacement. Looks for a weakness. There is none. He motions to Forrest and Jackson to wait. The three of them settle into the darkness.

EXT. MACHINE GUN NEST - BRIDGE - NIGHT

Sarge, Upham and Reiben sit with Ryan in the darkness. Ryan is lost in thought, far away. One after another, Miller's men eye him.

SARGE
Private, I'm sorry about your
brothers.

Ryan nods. Then, with some difficulty, he makes the trip from Iowa back to France. He turns to Sarge.

RYAN
What was the name of the guy who
got killed coming up here?

SARGE
Wade.

RYAN
Wade.	Huh, he died coming up here
to keep me alive...I never met
him...he didn't know me from Adam,
strange.	What was he like?

SARGE
A good man, kind of cheerful,
Reiben, here, used to call him a
happy idiot.

REIBEN
Like hell, I did.

RYAN
My brothers would be mighty pissed off at me, if they knew I let some guy get killed trying to keep me alive.
 
106.


SARGE
You didn't let anybody get killed, you didn't even know we were coming up here.

RYAN
Sure, I know, but...
(sighs)
Goddamn it all...

The others nod in agreement.	They look closely at Ryan.

EXT. GERMAN EIGHTY-EIGHT EMPLACEMENT - NIGHT

Dark.	No firing.	Two German soldiers on watch.

A SHADOW

It's Miller. Easing through the darkness. Closer to one of the sentries.

Miller sees Jackson easing up behind another sentry. Miller nods to Jackson. They move at the same moment. Behind the sentries. SLIT THEIR THROATS.

BEHIND THE EIGHTY-EIGHT

Forrest removes the wheel-blocks.

A GERMAN SENTRY

Approaches. He sees Forrest. Just as he's about to open up with his sub-machine gun, Miller grabs him from behind, STABS him, eases the body silently to the ground.

MILLER AND JACKSON

Join Forrest at the eighty-eight.

Together they attach the eighty-eight's carriage to the German's truck.

ANOTHER GERMAN SENTRY

Rounds a corner. Sees them. OPENS UP WITH HIS SUB-MACHINE GUN.

Forrest DIVES, FIRES BACK.

OTHER GERMANS

Race over, FIRING.
 
107.


JACKSON

Covering them, OPENS UP.	Kills the advancing Germans.

MILLER frantically attaches the eighty-eight to the truck.

FORREST CUTS DOWN, several more Germans.

JACKSON TAKES A GRAZING SHOT IN THE SHOULDER.

Spins.

Still FIRING.

Giving Miller cover.

MILLER LEAPS into the cab of the truck.

JACKSON AND FORREST LEAP into the back.

JACKSON FIRES into the approaching Germans.

THE WINDSHIELD

Is shattered by bullets.

Glass flies everywhere, cutting Miller on the face and hands.

FORREST

In the back of the truck. Spraying the Germans with his Thompson.

MILLER FLOORS IT.

The truck DRIVES through the Germans.

The Germans FIRE at the truck and trailing eighty-eight.

MILLER, JACKSON AND FORREST

Drive into the night. The Germans FIRING after them.

EXT. ROAD LEADING TO THE BRIDGE - NIGHT

Miller, Jackson and Forrest barrel down the road through a gauntlet of Germans. As they approach the bridge, the other American's FIRE COVER for them. Miller drives the truck onto the bridge.
 
108.


SMASHES INTO THE SANDBAGS

THE OTHER AMERICANS, with Ryan in the lead, leap over the barricade and drag the captured eighty-eight onto the bridge.

MILLER
RYAN!	GET BACK THERE!

Ryan ignores him. They get the eighty-eight safely behind the barricade. Miller grabs Ryan.

RYAN
Sorry, sir.

Miller fumes. He sees Reiben, Sarge and Upham, shrugging, clearly not pissed at Ryan.

MILLER
Don't do that again.

RYAN
I won't need to sir, it's already here, behind the barricade so...

Miller GROWLS.

RYAN
(continuing)
Yes, sir.

Miller glares at Ryan, then strides off.

EXT. FIELD - NIGHT

Miller and Upham carefully dig up a German mine. Very gingerly they place it on a growing pile of other mines.

EXT. ROAD LEADING TO BRIDGE - NIGHT

Miller and Ryan lay a mine into the dirt. They cover it and step back carefully.

Then they proceed with the next. Upham is covering their tracks while Jackson is digging the holes in which they'll place the rest of the mines.

EXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT

Quiet. Dark. Everything is ready. There's nothing to do now but wait.
 
109.


ON THE BRIDGEKEEPERS HUT

Reiben and Jackson sit behind the sandbags. They can see Ryan sitting in the moonlight about twenty yards away, manning the rear machine gun nest with Sarge.

REIBEN
What do you think?

JACKSON
I think I'm we got that eighty-
eight.

REIBEN
I mean, Ryan, what do you think of him?

Jackson shrugs.

JACKSON
He ain't half-bad, I guess.

REIBEN
I guess.

They're quiet for a moment.

WADE
He ain't Wade.

REIBEN
Nope, he ain't Wade.

Their eyes keep coming back to Ryan.

MILLER

Crouch-runs through the shadows and stops at the bridgekeepers hut.

MILLER
Reiben...

Miller points, directing Reiben to the forward machine gun nest.

REIBEN
Yes, sir.

REIBEN jumps down and moves forward.
 
110.


MILLER runs across the bridge and joins Sarge and Ryan in the rear machine gun nest.

MILLER
You set?

Sarge nods.

RYAN
Yes, sir.

Miller and Sarge exchange a look. Then Miller slips off to check the others.

EXT. BRIDGE - DAWN

First light. The Americans are ready for battle. WE SEE them in their positions:

REIBEN AND UPHAM

Manning the forward machine gun nest.

JACKSON

Behind the sandbags, on top of the bridgekeeper's hut.

FORREST AND THE PARATROOPERS

Behind the second of two barricades set up between the forward and the rear machine gun nests.

RYAN AND SARGE

Manning rear machine gun.

MILLER

At the bridgehead, waiting.

A SOUND FROM DOWN THE ROAD

All eyes turn.

A SINGLE GERMAN SOLDIER

Dashes across the street. Exposed only for an instant. Then another. And another.

MILLER

Cocks his Thompson.	Settles down behind some sandbags.
 
111.


MILLER
HERE THEY COME!

A RUSH OF GERMANS ADVANCE, BLASTING AT THE BRIDGE.

THE AMERICANS RETURN FIRE

REIBEN

OPENS UP with the MACHINE GUN.

THE GERMANS

At least fifty of them, advancing on the bridge. Running from cover to cover. A squad pushing a French truck, using it as a shield.

JACKSON

Calmly picking off the attacking Germans.

THE GERMAN INFANTRYMEN

Make their way down the streets. Along the riverbank. Through the houses. There are GERMANS FIRING from all directions.

REIBEN FIRES IN ARCS.

MILLER

Sees Reiben and Upham being cut off. Grabs the B.A.R., stands and fires.

REIBEN AND UPHAM

Running out of ammo. See that there's nothing else they can do.

REIBEN
Time to go.

Reiben rolls out of the nest, carrying the fifty caliber. Upham follows, carrying the ammo boxes. They run as fast as they can.

THE OTHER AMERICANS FIRE COVER

REIBEN takes a glancing slug.	Falls.	Rolls and gets up.
Bleeding from the side, but not mortal.	Upham helps him.

They MAKE IT TO THE SANDBAGS of the first barricade.
 
112.


DIVE OVER.	The Germans are almost on them.

RYAN IS FIRING

With the rear MACHINE GUN.	Drops several Germans.

GERMANS EVERYWHERE

They swarm over the first barricade.

MILLER

FIRES A BURST into a German's belly. HITS another with the stock of his Thompson.

HAND-TO-HAND.

FORREST AND THE OTHER PARATROOPERS

FIRING COVER for Miller, Reiben and Upham, don't see a flanking Germans squad easing along the riverbanks. Two of the Germans LOB POTATO MASHERS among the paratroopers.

THE PARATROOPERS see the grenades.	Too late.

THE POTATO MASHERS EXPLODE

KILLING FORREST AND THE OTHER PARATROOPERS

RYAN SEES FORREST AND THE OTHERS DIE

No time to react.

HAND-TO-HAND FIGHTING

Half a dozen Germans break through.

Miller KILLS TWO MORE WITH A BURST.

RYAN

Is jumped on by one.	Upham FIRES.	KILLS the German.

MILLER

Struggling with a pair of Germans.

JACKSON

FIRES.	Drops one of the Germans on Miller with a head shot.
Cuts open Miller's face with bits of skull.
 
113.


RYAN

Leaps onto the final German attacking Miller. That German raises his rifle on Ryan.

UPHAM AND REIBEN AND JACKSON

All see it.	SIMULTANEOUSLY SHOOT the German.

THE STUNNED GERMAN

About to kill Ryan. Torn apart by bullets from three directions.

UPHAM
I got him.

REIBEN
Like hell you did, I got him.

JACKSON SMILES.

He got him.

MILLER SLAMS in a fresh clip. FIRES an arc. DROPS four Germans. Sees an oncoming RUSH OF GERMANS. BARKS to Reiben and Upham:

MILLER
BACK!	LET'S GO!

They retreat, firing back as best they can, trying to make it to the barricade.

SARGE

Sees them in deep trouble. Leaves Ryan firing the rear machine gun. Grabs the B.A.R. ADVANCES, FIRING COVER. Exposed.

BULLETS EVERYWHERE

MILLER, REIBEN, UPHAM make it to the barricade.	Dive over.

SARGE

Sees they've made it.	FIRES A FINAL BURST.	Races for cover.
A trail of bullets right behind him.

THE OTHER AMERICANS FIRE for all they're worth. Trying to cover Sarge. Too many Germans.
 
114.


SARGE TAKES A SHOT IN THE BACK. FALLS. MILLER AND THE OTHERS continue to fire, horrified.

SARGE STRUGGLES TO HIS FEET

Cradling the B.A.R.	Stumbling toward cover.	Slowing.
Bleeding.

THE AMERICANS

Desperately trying to cover him.

THE GERMANS

Open up with a volley.

SARGE

Is almost there.

ALL THE AMERICANS STAND AND FIRE

As best they can.	Right past Sarge.	It's not enough.

SARGE

Five feet from the sandbags, his back is TORN APART by Germans fire. He looks down, stunned at his chest. Amazed to see GAPING HOLES. An instant of surprise, more than fear.

He looks to Miller. Takes two more stumbling steps. Falls onto the sandbags. Dropping the B.A.R. over the edge. Dies.

THE AMERICANS FIRE MADLY, CONTINUOUSLY

THE GERMANS

Who killed Sarge are killed.	The others back off for now.
REIBEN, UPHAM, JACKSON, RYAN fire at the retreating Germans.

MILLER

Grabs Sarge and pulls him over the barricade. Sees that he's dead.

THE GERMANS RETREAT.

Around the corner.

MILLER

Stunned, lays Sarge down, kneeling next to him.
 
115.


THE OTHERS

Watch, start to gather.

REIBEN
Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...

MILLER
Get back to your positions!

They hesitate.

MILLER
(continuing)
Go!

They follow the order.	All except Ryan, who doesn't move.
He can't take his eyes off Sarge.

MILLER

Doesn't move.	He just stares at Sarge's body.

RYAN

Looks at Miller, sees him growing weak, starting to sway. He gently tries to move Miller aside.

RYAN
I'll take care of Sarge...

Miller looks up at Ryan, then back at Sarge's body. Miller grows cold, making the same startling transformation he made as he kneeled over Wade's body.

MILLER
Sarge?	Who's Sarge?

But this time it doesn't work. He can't make it stick. The hard expression, disappears. He drifts, utterly lost. He's called his own bluff.

EXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT

Dark.	Quiet.	The distant guns are silent for once.

Waiting. Reiben, Upham, Jackson, Ryan and Miller have tightened their perimeter.

Miller is in a trance.	The others glance at him nervously.
 
116.


They eat in silence.	K-rations.	Some bread.	A last supper.

Then, from out of nowhere, Miller speaks:

MILLER
English teacher, Addley,
Pennsylvania.

Slowly, Miller's men turn to him.

UPHAM
What'd you say, Captain?

MILLER
I teach English at Addley High
School in Addley, Pennsylvania.

REIBEN
Well, I'll be goddamned, I knew it.

JACKSON
Like hell, you did.

UPHAM
Captain, what about our deal?

MILLER
I changed my mind.

REIBEN
What deal?

MILLER
I coach the baseball team, too.

JACKSON
No kiddin'?

REIBEN
What deal?

UPHAM
Forget it.

They all sit in silence.

MILLER
You know that cruise ship Wade's
grandfather was on?

They all nod, except Ryan who doesn't know what Miller's talking about.
 
117.


MILLER
(continuing)
I wonder if his cabin is still
available?

REIBEN
That's not where I am.

MILLER
No?	Where are you?

REIBEN
I'm in a dressing room with Mrs. Rachel Troubowitz, our super's wife. She's an easy forty-four, double E, but I've convinced her she's a thirty-eight D and I'm watching her try and squeeze herself into a side-stay, silk-ribboned, three-panel girdle with shelf-lift brassiere.
(smiles)
She's having a devil of a time,
getting into that thing.

They all share Reiben's dream for a moment. Then Jackson smiles.

JACKSON
Me?	I'm walking with my hound,
Lucy, it's about an hour 'fore
sunrise and we're out huntin'
coon.	I got me a flask of pure
Kentucky mash whiskey...

REIBEN
Jackson, how many times I got to
tell you, you're from Tennessee.

JACKSON
I am, but I like imported whiskey. So there I am and I hear the biggest ole' coon you ever did hear, 'a rustlin' right there in front of me. That ole' boy comes right out of the brush, I got a clear shot and he knows he's 'bout to meet his maker.
(more)
 
118.


JACKSON (cont'd)
I aim, I got my finger tight on the trigger and then I just smile and say to that ole' coon, go on, now, you get out 'a here. Then I sit down on a hollow log and take me a right long pull a' that mash whiskey.

Upham smiles.

UPHAM
I don't know, I kind of like
Wade's idea about the cruise ship.
I've never been to Tahiti.

REIBEN
What about you, Captain?

Miller smiles.	He knows exactly where he is.

MILLER
I'm in my backyard, lying in my
hammock, with my arm around my
wife, listening for the sound of
breaking glass.

JACKSON
Say what, Cap'n?

MILLER
You see, I've got the best house in all of Addley. It's not the biggest house, but it's got the best location, right next to the junior high baseball field. The garage windows face left field. The guy who owned the house before me had these heavy screens put over them. The first thing I did when I bought the place was take off those screens. Two-hundred-twenty-two yards from home plate to my garage windows. It takes a hell of a junior high kid to hit a ball that far. I look at my garage windows as a motivator and a way to scout the kids coming up, the ones who are going to give us a shot at the state championship.
(more)
 
119.


MILLER (cont'd)
I lay there in my hammock and
every time I hear the sound of
breaking glass, I know we're one
step closer to winning it all.

JACKSON
Don't that get kind of expensive,
Cap'n?

MILLER
It's worth it.

JACKSON
To each, his own.

They're all silent for a moment.	Then Miller turns to Ryan.

MILLER
How about you, James?

Ryan sighs.

RYAN
I'm home, playing basketball with my brothers, it's evenin' time, we're trying' to get in a few more points before it's too dark to see the ball. That's where I am.

They all nod. Miller tears off a piece of bread and passes it to Ryan who tears off a bit and passes it on. They all eat in silence.

EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF RAMELLE - DAWN

First light. Lovely. Dew shimmers. A ground fog drifts. A SOUND. Louder. And louder. A GERMAN TIGER TANK RUMBLES toward the village.

EXT. BRIDGE - RAMELLE - DAWN

All are awake.	At their positions.	Waiting.

MILLER

Hears the FAINT DISTANT RUMBLE OF THE TANK. Barely has time to react. Sees:
 
120.


THE GERMANS ADVANCING AGAIN

MILLER
Here they come.

REIBEN

FIRES a burst.	Germans drops.

MILLER

FIRES a burst.	More Germans drop.

THE GERMANS KEEP COMING

Lots of them.	Moving from cover to cover.	FIRING.

MILLER

Manning the forward machine gun. Way out front. Sees that he's going to be cut off. He grabs the hot gun. The barrel burns into his flesh. He ignores the pain and RUNS BACK toward the bridge.

HE DIVES over the sandbags. barely makes it. TRAILED BY BULLETS.

THE GERMANS

Take positions near the bridge.	Moving in.	FIRING.
Overwhelming. They're everywhere.

THREE GERMANS

Break through the perimeter.

RYAN SHOOTS one.	GRAPPLES with the other two.

REIBEN

Sees Ryan.	Races over.	SHOOTS one German.	STABS the other.

RYAN FALLS BACK.	Stunned, unhurt.

REIBEN only gives him a quick look.	Gets to the MACHINE GUN.

OPENS UP against the Germans who are still coming. FIRES A LONG BURST. Germans drop.

MILLER

FIRES again.	More Germans drop.
 
121.


THE GERMANS

Take positions in the building near the bridge.

They start working their way to the tops of the nearby buildings.

Making their way along the riverbanks.

REIBEN AND RYAN

Forward.	Reiben FIRING.	Ryan feeding the ammo belt.

REIBEN
MORE AMMO!

UPHAM

Hears that. Doesn't hesitate. He grabs a pair of ammo boxes. RUNS toward Reiben and Ryan.

SEVERAL GERMANS ZERO UPHAM

OPEN UP on him.

BULLETS TRAIL UPHAM.	He's outrunning them.	Almost there.

UPHAM

TAKES HALF-A-DOZEN SLUGS. Torn apart. Stumbles the final few steps to the machine gun nest. Falls on the sandbags, giving Reiben and Ryan the ammo. UPHAM'S DEAD.

RYAN STUNNED.

For just a micro-second. No time. Grabs the ammo. REIBEN FIRING. Ryan clips the new ammo belt onto the tail of the one almost out.

REIBEN

Continues FIRING.	CUTTING DOWN the advancing Germans.

THE GERMANS START TO FALL BACK

MILLER

Knows what that means.	He hears the RUMBLE OF THE TANKS.

MILLER
TIGHTEN IT UP!	HERE THEY COME!
 
122.


RYAN AND REIBEN

Immediately grab the machine gun and ammo and race back to the rear nest.

Then RYAN AND MILLER converge at the eighty-eight.

THE FIRST TANK APPEARS

Huge. Terrifying. Clanking. Trailed by two German infantry platoons.

JACKSON

On the bridgekeeper's hut. Picking off German soldiers who follow the tank.

A GERMAN INFANTRYMAN SPOTS JACKSON. Hollers into the tanks voice-tube.

THE TANK

Stops. Grinds its gears. Turning it's turret towards the bridgekeepers hut.

MILLER
JACKSON!

JACKSON

Knows what's coming but he holds his position, continuing to pick off German soldiers.

THE TANK BLASTS

THE BRIDGEKEEPER'S HUT AND JACKSON

ARE OBLITERATED IN THE EXPLOSION.

MILLER AND RYAN

SEE JACKSON DIE. A bare moment to react. Then, they turn their attention back to the eighty-eight. Frantically turning the aiming cranks. Lowering the barrel to point blank.

TANK AGAINST EIGHTY-EIGHT.

Which can fire first.
 
123.


MILLER AND RYAN

Win the race.

FIRE THE EIGHTY-EIGHT

BLAST THE LEAD TANK

DESTROY IT IN A SHOWER OF METAL AND FLAMES

MILLER AND RYAN

Quickly reload the eighty-eight.	FIRE AGAIN.

DESTROY THE SECOND TANK.

MILLER

Shoves the FINAL SHELL into the breech of the eighty-eight.
Pats Ryan on the back.	Grabs a SATCHEL CHARGE.

RUNS down the bridge.	Right toward the two advancing tanks.

RYAN

FIRES THE EIGHTY-EIGHT.

DESTROYING THE THIRD TANK.

MILLER

Races through the debris.	Trailed by BULLETS.

REIBEN

With the machine gun. Covers Miller. Keeping most of the German infantry down.

RYAN jumps behind the second machine gun. Opens up. Helping to cover Miller.

THE LAST GERMAN TANK

Turret spins.	Turning toward the fast approaching Miller.
Ready to blow him to bits.

MILLER

Is almost there.	He arms the satchel charge.

THE TIGER'S MACHINE GUNS OPENS UP ON HIM.
 
124.


BLASTS A TRAIL OF BULLETS

MILLER

Throws the satchel charge under the tank. Rolls off the edge of the bridge. Lands on the embankment below.

THE LAST TIGER TANK EXPLODES

MILLER, RYAN, REIBEN continue FIRING.

Almost out of ammo.

MILLER SCRAMBLING UP THE EMBANKMENT, back onto the bridge, ears something over the SOUNDS OF FIRING.

MILLER
HOLD IT!	HOLD IT!

Ryan and Reiben cease firing.	Now they hear it, too.

A RUMBLE, DEEPER AND MORE OMINOUS than any they've heard yet.

MILLER
(continuing)
Goddamn it!

REIBEN
More tanks...

RYAN
Lot's of them.

The fear on their faces turns to resignation. They know that they are dead men. They settle into their positions, and prepare to fire and die.

They wait.	The RUMBLE GETS LOUDER AND LOUDER.

THEN MILLER'S FACE STARTS TO CHANGE...a hint...of a smile...then a real smile...

AN AMERICAN SHERMAN TANK APPEARS from over the rise. Then ANOTHER...AND ANOTHER...AND ANOTHER...

MILLER, REIBEN AND RYAN

Stand there, stunned, watching tank after tank appear, along with scores of heavily-armed American soldiers.
 
125.


They keep coming and coming. American tanks, with wave after wave of U.S. infantrymen, looking for targets. They find a few among the departing Germans.

THE ADVANCING TROOPS

Run onto the bridge and start to secure the position. A SERGEANT and a few of HIS MEN look around, curiously eyeing Miller, Reiben and Ryan, battered and bloody, standing among the bodies.

A MAJOR strides up.

MAJOR
Report, Captain.

MILLER
Miller, Company B, Second Rangers, that's Private Richard Reiben and that's Private James Ryan, Hundred-and-First Airborne.

The Sergeant and several other soldiers overhear.

SERGEANT
Ryan?

One of the soldiers speaks quietly to another.

SOLDIER
That's him, that's Ryan.

The Major puts his hand on Ryan's shoulder.

MAJOR
Command is looking for you, son.
You're going home.

Ryan looks up, tired.	He nods.

EXT. RAMELLE BRIDGE HEAD - DAY

American tanks and hundreds of fresh troops stream down the road and over the bridge.

MILLER, RYAN AND REIBEN

Watch. In a small area, cleared of the debris, the bodies of Jackson, Upham, Sarge, Forrest and the other paratroopers are laid out, neatly, respectfully, covered.
 
126.


Miller and Reiben stay protectively close to Ryan, as if they don't want to risk him being bumped into or run over by any of the advancing troops or vehicles.

MILLER

Walks to the bodies. He kneels down next to Sarge and looks at him for a long moment. Then, with a steady hand, he takes one of Sarge's two dog-tags. Then he does the same to Jackson and Upham.

REIBEN AND RYAN watch silently.

MILLER

Stands and walks back to Reiben and Ryan. He hands the dog-tags to Ryan who grips them tightly and nods in thanks.

Miller takes a last look at the bridge and the bodies, then he shoulders his gear.

MILLER
Let's move out.

Reiben and Ryan gather up their gear. They walk with Miller down the road, away from the bridge.

CAMERA CRANES UP

The three dirty, bloodied, tired men walk down the road, ignored by the fresh troops marching in the opposite direction.

RYAN
Captain?

MILLER
Yes, Private.

RYAN
Upham and Jackson, what were they like?

MILLER
Upham?	Good kid, smart, he was
writing a book.

RYAN
Yeah?
 
127.


REIBEN
Yeah, and he was fast, too, ran
the 220 in twenty-four-five.

RYAN
No kidding.

MILLER
Jackson was from West Fork,
Tennessee, he was going to be a
preacher, his father and uncles
have a traveling ministry out of
the back of a stretch Hudson.

RYAN
And Sarge?

MILLER
Sarge?
(beat)
He was the best friend I ever had.
(smiles)
Lemme tell you about Sarge...

They walk on, disappearing in the distance among the hundreds and hundreds of American soldiers who are marching down the road and over the bridge.
