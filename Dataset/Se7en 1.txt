INT. OLD HOUSE - DAY
Sunlight comes through the soot on the windows, more brown than bright. SOMERSET, 45, stands in one corner of this small, second-story room. He looks over the ceiling, looks down at the worn wooden floors, looks at the peeling wallpaper.
He walks to the center of the room, continues his study, taking his time. He halts, turns to one wall where the current wallpaper is torn away to reveal flowery wallpaper underneath.
Somerset goes to this wall and runs his finger across one of the pale, red roses which decorates the older paper. He pushes the grime away, brings the rose out more clearly.
He reaches into his suit pocket and takes out a switchblade. He flips the thin, lethal blade free. Working deliberately, delicately, Somerset cuts a square around the rose, then peels the square of dry wallpaper away from the wall. He studies it in his hand.
EXT. OLD HOUSE - DAY
Somerset stands in front of the old home. He looks out at the surrounding farms and forests. He ponders something. Birds sing.
MAN (O.S.)
Is something wrong?
Somerset does not respond, just stares off. The MAN, 34, wears a real-estate broker's jacket and stands beside a FOR SALE sign in the muddy lawn.
MAN
Is there something the matter?
Somerset turns to face the man, then looks back at the house.
SOMERSET
No. No...  it's just that everything
here seems...  so strange.
MAN
Strange? There's nothing strange
about this place. The house'll need
a little fixing up, that's for sure... 
SOMERSET
No. I like the house, and this place.
MAN
I was about to say. Cause this place
is about as normal as places get.
Somerset nods, taking a deep breath. He smiles.
SOMERSET
That's what I mean. Strange.
Somerset looks back to the beautiful landscape. The man does not understand.
INT. AMTRACK TRAIN - LATER DAY
Somerset is in the window seat, looking out the window of the speeding train, smoking a cigarette. He is near the back of the car, away from the few other passengers.
Outside, farms, fields, small homes and lawns rush by. The panorama is dappled by the rays of the soon to be setting sun.
INT. AMTRACK TRAIN - LATER DAY
The train is almost full, moving slower. Somerset has his suitcase on the aisle seat beside him. He holds a hardcover book unopened on his lap. He still stares out the window, but his face is tense. The train is passing an ugly, swampy field. The sun has gone under.
Though it seems impossible it ever could have gotten there, a car's burnt-out skeleton sits rusting in the bracken.
Ahead, the city waits. The sky is full of smokestacks and huge industrial cranes.
INT. AMTRACK TRAIN - LATER DAY
The train is passing urban streets below. Slums and smashed cars. People stand in groups in the corners. Bleak.
Somerset's suitcase is now on the window seat. Somerset has moved to the aisle. He is reading his book. He looks up from the book and rubs his eyes, then looks back to continue reading, not once looking out the window.
EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT
Somerset carries his suitcase outside the train station.
The city demands attention: cars screeching, people yelling, sirens blaring.
Somerset passes a family of bewildered tourists. A WEIRD MAN has a hand on the tourist-father's suitcase.
It has become a tugging match with the Weird Man shouting, "I'll take you to a taxi...  I'll take you." Ahead, a group
is gathered on the sidewalk near two ambulances. People clamor to get a look at a BLOODY BODY which lies on the street.
Policeman try to hold the crowd off. Ambulance attendants administer aid to the victim, who convulses. Somerset moves by, ignoring it all. He motions for a cab. One pulls up from the street's stream of vehicles.
INT. CAB - NIGHT
Somerset throws his suitcase in and shuts the door behind him.
CAB DRIVER
(about the crowd)
What's the big fuss?
Somerset looks out at the crowd, looks at the driver.
SOMERSET
Why do you care?
CAB DRIVER
(under his breath)
Well, excuse me all to hell.
The driver leans forward, checking it out. The circle of spectators shifts suddenly. A man has shoved another man and they're really going at it now. The swing at each other and tear at each other's clothing. One man's flailing fist connects and the other man's face is instantly bloodied. The fight grows even more spastic. Policemen try to stop it.
CAB DRIVER
Crazy fucks.
The driver pulls away and the cab rages down the street.
Somerset watches the parade of neon passing on the avenue.
He slumps back in the seat and closes his eyes.
CAB DRIVER
Where you headed?
Somerset opens his eyes.
SOMERSET
Far away from here.
INT. SOMERSET'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
The curtains are closed. The SOUNDS of the CITY are here as they will be everywhere in this story. A CAR ALARM is SOUNDING, shrill and clear. Somerset's life is packed into moving boxes, except for some clothing in a closet and hundreds and hundreds of books on the shelves of one wall. Somerset is lying on the bed, dressed only in his underwear.
He reaches to the nightstand, to a wooden, pyramidical
metronome. He frees the metronome's weighted swingarm so it moves back and forth. Swings to the left -- TICK, swings to the right -- TICK. Tick...  tick...  tick...  measured and steady.
Somerset situates on the bed, closes his eyes. Tick...  tick... 
tick. The metronome's sound competes with the sound of the car alarm. Somerset's face tightens as he concentrates on the metronome. His eyes close tighter. Tick...  tick...  tick. The swingarm moves evenly. Somerset's breathing deepens.
Tick...  tick...  tick. The car alarm seems quieter.
Tick...  tick...  tick. Somerset continues his concentration.
The metronome's sound seems louder.
Tick...  tick...  tick. The sound of the car alarm fades, and is GONE. The metronome is the only sound.
Somerset's face relaxes as he begins to fall asleep. Tick... 
tick...  tick...

SUNDAY
INT. SOMERSET'S APARTMENT - MORNING
Somerset picks items off a moving box: his keys, wallet, switchblade, gold homicide badge. Finally, he opens the hardcover book he had with him on the train. From the pages, he takes the pale, paper rose.
INT. TENEMENT APARTMENT - DAY
Somerset stands before a wall which is stained by a star-burst of blood. A body lies on the floor under a sheet. A sawed-off shotgun lies not far from the body. The apartment is gloomy.
DETECTIVE TAYLOR, 52, stands on the other side of the room, looks through a notepad.
TAYLOR
Neighbors heard them screaming at
each other for like two hours. It
was nothing new. But, then they heard
the gun go off. Both barrels.
SOMERSET
Did the wife confess?
TAYLOR
When the patrolman came she was trying
put his head back together. She was
crying too hard to say anything.
Somerset beings walking around the apartment.
SOMERSET
Why always like this? Only after the
fact...  this sudden realization,
that if you shoot someone, or stick
a knife in them, that person will
cease to exist.
TAYLOR
Crime of passion.
SOMERSET
Yes. Look at all the passion
splattered up on the wall here.
TAYLOR
This is a done deal. All but the
paperwork.
Taylor shifts his weight, impatient. Somerset looks at a coloring book open on the coffee table. There are crayons beside it. Somerset picks the book up, flips through the pages.
SOMERSET
Did their son see it happen?
TAYLOR
I don't know.
Taylor closes his notebook, perturbed. Somerset looks at the pictures of cute, crudely colored animals.
TAYLOR
What kind of fucking question is
that anyway?
Taylor walks over and grabs the coloring book to get his attention.
TAYLOR
You know, we're all real glad we're
getting rid of you, Somerset. You
know that? I mean, it's always these
questions with you...  "Did the kid
see it?" Well, who gives a fuck?
Huh?
(points)
He's dead. His wife killed him.
Taylor throws the coloring book back to Somerset and walks.
TAYLOR
Anything else has nothing to do with
us.
Taylor leaves, pushing past DETECTIVE DAVID MILLS, 31, who is just entering. Mills is muscular and handsome. He looks back at Taylor, then around the apartment, a bit disoriented.
Somerset puts down the coloring book. He stares at the floor, showing no reaction to Taylor's tantrum.
MILLS
Uh, Lieutenant Somerset?
Somerset turns to see Mills.
EXT. CITY STREET - DAY
A body bag is carried through a crowd of people outside the tenement building.
Somerset follows the body bag out and Mills follows Somerset.
They walk towards the end of the filthy block, past a man urinating on a car.
MILLS
I'm a little thrown. I just got in
town like twenty minutes ago and
they dumped me here.
SOMERSET
Since we're just starting out, I
thought we could go to a bar...  sit
and talk for awhile. After that,
we'll... 
MILLS
(interrupting)
Actually, if it's all the same, I'd
like to get to the precinct house
a.s.a.p. Seeing how we don't have
much time for this whole transition
thing.
Somerset keeps walking, says nothing.
MILLS
I need to start getting the feel of
it all, right? Meet the people.
SOMERSET
I meant to ask you something, Mills,
when we spoke on the phone. I can't
help wondering...  why here?
MILLS
I...  I don't follow.
SOMERSET
All this effort you've made to get
transferred, it's the first question
that pops into my head.
MILLS
I'm here for the same reasons as
you, I guess. Or, at least, the same
reasons you used to have for being
here before...  before you decided
to...  quit.
Somerset stops and faces Mills.
SOMERSET
You just met me.
MILLS
Maybe I'm not understanding the
question.
SOMERSET
It's very simple. You worked a nice,
quiet town, but you fought to get
here as if your life depended on it.
I've just never seen it done that
way before, Detective.
MILLS
Maybe I thought I could do more good
here than there. I don't know. Look,
it'd be great by me if we didn't
start right off kicking each other
in the balls. But, you're calling
the shots, Lieutenant, so...  however
you want it to go.
SOMERSET
Let me tell you how I want this to
go. I want you to look, and I want
you to listen.
MILLS
I wasn't standing around guarding
the local Taco Bell. I've worked
homicide for five and a half years.
SOMERSET
Not here.
MILLS
I realize that.
SOMERSET
Well, over the next seven days, do
me the favor of remembering it.
Somerset turns and walks away. Mills stands a moment, pissed.
He follows after Somerset.
INSERT -- TITLE CARD
MONDAY
INT. SOMERSET'S APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING
Somerset lies asleep in bed. It is still dark outside. The PHONE beside the inactive metronome RINGS. Somerset awakens suddenly, startled. He looks towards the phone.
INT. MILLS' APARTMENT, BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING
It is just barely becoming light outside. Mills is wide awake in bed beside the sleeping form of his wife, TRACY, 30. Mills looks tired. He listens to passing traffic. He covers his eyes with his forearm.
He takes his arm away and sits up, frustrated, sits on the edge of the bed. The room is a shambles, filled with moving boxes.
Light coming through the window glows upon a football trophy sticking from one box.
Large and noble, a golden player stands in frozen motion at the trophy's pinnacle.
Mills looks at the trophy and a fond smile forms on his face.
The PHONE RINGS. Mills looks towards it. Tracy awakens. She looks up with half-opened eyes, a beautiful woman.
TRACY
What is it?
Phone rings. Mills reaches to touch Tracy's shoulder.
MILLS
It's okay.
Mills leans to get the phone. Tracy seems frightened.
TRACY
Honey...  where are we?
EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING, ALLEYWAY - EARLY MORNING
Somerset and Mills, both wearing badges, walk with OFFICER DAVIS, a beefy, uniformed cop. They pass police cars and head into a trash strewn alleyway. Davis hands Somerset two flashlights.
DAVIS
Everything's like I found it. I didn't
touch anything.
SOMERSET
What time did you confirm the death?
DAVIS
Like I said, I didn't touch him, but
he's had his face in a plate of
spaghetti for about forty-five minutes
now.
They reach a rusty, side door, which Davis pulls open.
INT. APARTMENT BUILDING, STAIRWELL - EARLY MORNING
They enter a dark, ugly stairwell.
MILLS
(to Davis)
Hold on...  you mean you didn't check
for vital signs?
DAVIS
Did I stutter? Believe me, he ain't
breathing, unless he's started
breathing spaghetti sauce.
MILLS
The point is, whenever you find... 
DAVIS
Begging your pardon, but the guy's
sitting in pile of his own shit and
piss. If he ain't dead, he would've
stood up by now.
Mills is angry, about to speak, but Somerset heads him off.
SOMERSET
(to Davis)
Thank you, officer. We'll need to
talk to you again, after we've looked
around.
DAVIS
Yes, sir.
Davis walks out, eyeing Mills. Mills watches him go. The rusty door slams shut behind Davis. It's very dark. Somerset turns on his flashlight, hands the other to Mills and starts upstairs.
SOMERSET
I wonder what exactly was the point
of the conversation you were about
to get into?
MILLS
And I wonder how many times Officer
Davis there has found a dead man who
wasn't really dead until Davis was
in the car calling it in and eating
a donut.
SOMERSET
Drop it.
MILLS
For now.
INT. APARTMENT BUILDING, HALLWAY - EARLY MORNING
Somerset comes from the stairwell, looking down the dark hall. At the end of the hall, a door is open. The light of a CAMERA FLASH spills out from that room every few seconds.
Mills and Somerset move on. Somerset takes out rubber gloves and slips them on, looking at something on the floor ahead.
A yellow RECYCLING BIN sits just outside the door. It contains many neat, string-bound stacks of issues of READER'S DIGEST.
INT. APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - EARLY MORNING
There are lights on in this room. Lamps with dusty shades. A few porn mags on a table. Somerset and Mills cross. A couch against one wall is piled with yellowed, once white pillows. It faces two small televisions, both on with no sound.
INT. APARTMENT, KITCHEN - EARLY MORNING
Somerset and Mills enter, using their flashlights in the dark. Mills takes out a handkerchief, covering his nose.
ERIC is crouched on the floor, putting camera equipment away.
He's wearing a medical mask over his face. He hoists his bag and moves past the detectives.
ERIC
Enjoy.
Eric leaves. Somerset sweeps the room with his flashlight... 
At the stove, each burner has a used pot or pan on it. Food has been slopped there and on the adjoining counter-top and sink.
Used utensils are everywhere, along with empty tin cans and jars.
Cockroaches swarm.
The flashlight beam follows a trail of dripped sauces, soups and crumbs of food across the floor from the stove to a kitchen table. The kitchen table is covered in soiled paper plates which hold bits of half-eaten sandwiches, potatoes, beef stew, donuts and many other junk foods.
The kitchen is tiny; barely enough room for three people. The kitchen table is at the center of the room. An OBESE MAN is slumped forward in a kitchen chair. He is face down dead in a plate of spaghetti.
MILLS
Christ...  somebody phone Guinness. I
think we've got a World's Record
here.
Mills walks to the dead man, leaning to study, without touching.
MILLS
Who said this was murder?
SOMERSET
No one yet.
MILLS
Then, why are we wasting our time?
This guy's heart's got to be roughly
the size of a canned ham. If this
isn't a coronary, I don't know what
is.
Somerset moves his flashlight beam down the obese corpse, stops at the man's feet. Somerset kneels.
At the obese man's pants cuff, there's a tiny bit of rope sticking out. Somerset uses a pen to lift the pants leg. Rope is tied around the swollen, purple ankle.
MILLS
Or not.
Somerset stands and steps back. Mills bends to take his place, looking under the table and shining his flashlight into the corpse's lap. The obese man's bloated hands are folded there, bound tightly with rope.
MILLS
Still...  he could have tied himself
up, to make it look like murder. I
saw a guy once...  committed suicide,
but wanted to make sure his family
could collect the life insurance,
right?
Somerset does not listen. He is focused on the corpse, studies the back of the man's head and neck. He runs his pen against the back of the corpse's neck, combing the hair upwards.
There are small circular and semi-circular BRUISES on the back of the obese man's head and neck, some hidden under the hair.
MILLS
When we found him, he was lying there
with a knife in his back, so what
else could it be but homicide? Except,
I finally figured out...  he held the
knife behind him...  put the tip of
it in his own back and got real close
to the wall...  then he shoved his
body backwards... 
SOMERSET
(irritated)
Please be quiet for a while, would
you?
Mills looks up at Somerset from below. Somerset remains focused on the bruises.
MILLS
(sarcastic)
Oh, yes, sir. Forgive me.
Mills stands and walks around to the other side of the table, where he gets down again.
MILLS
There's a bucket here.
SOMERSET
What?
MILLS
There's a bucket. Under the table.
Somerset crouches, pulls up the cheap tablecloth on his side of the table. A METAL BUCKET sits under the table.
SOMERSET
What is it?
Mills slides under with his flashlight, angling in the confined space to look. He is repulsed and pulls back.
MILLS
It's vomit.
Mills stands and backs away, near the refrigerator, not wanting to be anywhere near that bucket.
MILLS
It's a bucket of vomit.
SOMERSET
Is there any blood in it?
MILLS
I don't know. Feel free to look for
yourself, okay?
Somerset stands, stares at the obese man. He shakes his head, perplexed. There is a KNOCK at the door. The detectives look to see DOCTOR THOMAS O'NEILL, 52, the medical examiner, in the doorway. O'Neill is looking at the ceiling. He flicks the lights switch. No light, so he flicks the switch up and down.
O'NEILL
Wonderful.
O'Neill seems a bit gone. He drops his black bag onto the floor beside the corpse. He begins to sort through the bag, surgical tools clinking together.
Mills turns to open the refrigerator. It's nearly empty.
MILLS
(to Somerset)
You think it was poison?
SOMERSET
Guessing at this point is useless.
The trash can beside the refrigerator is filled to the brim with empty food containers. Mills begins to poke around with a pen.
O'NEILL
You girls have got forensics waiting
outside. I don't know if we'll all
fit though.
MILLS
There's room. Light's the problem.
Somerset looks at Mills, then at the space limitations.
SOMERSET
Still...  two is company here. And,
three is certainly a crowd.
(pause)
Detective Mills, go help the officers
question the neighbors.
Mills looks up, not pleased.
MILLS
I'd rather stay on this.
Somerset is looking at the corpse.
SOMERSET
Send one of the forensics in on your
way out.
Mills does not move. He lifts his flashlight to shine the light on the side of Somerset's face. A moment. Somerset looks at Mills, the light shining directly in Somerset's eyes. A longer moment. Mills switches off the light and leaves.
O'Neill places both hands on the dead man's head and lifts the swollen visage from the spaghetti.
O'NEILL
He is dead.
SOMERSET
Thank you, Doctor.
INT. SOMERSET'S CAR - DAY
Somerset drives with Mills as the passenger. Heavy city
traffic.
Both stare ahead in silence. Mills is a bundle of nerves.
MILLS
You've seen my files, right? Seen
the things I've done?
SOMERSET
No.
MILLS
(looking out window)
Anyway...  I did my time on door-to-
doors, and walking a beat. I did all
that shit for a long time.
SOMERSET
Good.
MILLS
The badge in my pocket says
"detective," same as yours.
SOMERSET
I made a decision, because I have to
consider the integrity of the scene.
I can't worry whether you think you're
getting enough time on the playing
field.
MILLS
Yeah, well, all I want is... 
(pause)
Just, just don't be jerking me off.
That's all I ask. Don't jerk me off.
Mills looks at Somerset. Somerset keeps his eyes on the road, but nods slightly. That said, Mills slumps low into his seat.
SOMERSET
We'll be spending every waking hour
together till I leave. I'll show you
who your friends are, and your
enemies. I'll help you cut through
the red tape and I will help you
"integrate," as the captain puts it.
However... 
(pauses, clears throat)
No matter how much you beg or plead... 
jerking off is something you'll have
to do for yourself.
This throws Mills. Somerset has a sense of humour?
SOMERSET
Is that clear?
MILLS
Okay...  sure...  It's just that, with
my old partner, you know... 
SOMERSET
I just don't think we should have
that sort of relationship. We'd start
quarreling over insignificant things.
Mills lets out a nervous laugh, feels a bit of weight off his shoulders.
MILLS
Whatever you say, Detective.
Beautiful.
INT. AUTOPSY ROOM - DAY
The room is large, cold and clean. Stainless steel and white tile. Many pathologists work at slabs. A bone saw screams.
Mills and Somerset are with DOCTOR SANTIAGO, who stands over the obese corpse which is pretty well dissected already.
SANTIAGO
He's been dead for a long time, and
I can tell you it was not a poison.
Santiago moves to make room for Mills to stand beside him.
Mills moves up a little, but not much, looking on in disgust.
Santiago reaches into the man's belly. We do not see.
MILLS
Ah, man...  how does somebody let
himself go like that? Look at the
blubber.
Santiago moves something and there is a squashy sound.
SANTIAGO
It took four orderlies and me all
together just to put this body on
the table.
MILLS
How did the fat fuck ever fit out
the door of his apartment?
SOMERSET
Yes, it's obvious he was a shut-in.
Not an enviable life, but, maybe he
still deserves a modicum of respect
in spite of that.
SANTIAGO
Are you looking here? First...  see
how big this stomach is. And, see
the strange thing. Stretches. And,
here it is distended. Look at the
size of that, because of all the
foods.
MILLS
I can see what you're pointing at,
but... 
SANTIAGO
Lines of distention across the
stomach, and parts have ripped open.
SOMERSET
(disbelief)
Doctor, are you saying...  this man
ate till he burst?
SANTIAGO
Well, he didn't really burst. Not
all the way. But, he was bleeding
inside himself, and there is a
hematoma on the outside, on the belly.
Very large.
MILLS
He died by eating?
SANTIAGO
Yes. And, there's something else
here you have to look at and see.
Santiago goes to root through many jars on a table. Somerset walks around the slab, looking down at the obese man's propped up, partially shaved head.
SOMERSET
These bruises on the victim's head... 
More round and semi-circular bruises have been revealed, all about the same diameter as a dime.
SANTIAGO
I don't know what they are yet.
They... 
SOMERSET
They could have been caused by a
gun. The barrel of a gun...  pressed
against the back of his head.
Santiago picks up the jar he was looking for, comes to lean and look at the obese man's head, nodding again.
SANTIAGO
If it was jammed against him hard
enough, sure. It's possible. Here... 
Santiago gives the jar to Somerset.
SANTIAGO
Most of the stomach's food contents
are in the lab now...  but, these... 
I found these in his stomach too.
Somerset holds the jar up. Inside are many little pieces of blue plastic. They are curled slightly, as if they are scrapings.
Somerset hands the jar to Mills. Mills shakes it, studying.
MILLS
Plastic?
SANTIAGO
Why these are in a fat man's stomach,
I don't know.
INT. APARTMENT, KITCHEN - DAY
The room where the obese corpse was found is now lit by fluorescent light. Two forensics, a MALE and FEMALE, are dusting for prints. Somerset and Mills are on their hands and knees.
Somerset holds the jar and touches the linoleum floor.
SOMERSET
Same color and texture.
MILLS
(to forensics)
Have you found any plastic scrapings
near the stove or sink? Near the
food?
MALE FORENSIC
What do you mean?
Mills and Somerset continue looking around the floor.
MILLS
(to Somerset)
This doesn't make any sense.
SOMERSET
You always have to find one singular
thing to focus on. There's always
one thing, and it may be as small as
a speck of dust, but you find it and
focus...  till it's an exhausted
possibility.
The forensics watch, curious. Somerset is near the refrigerator.
MILLS
It could be nothing.
SOMERSET
But, why would there be so many pieces
in his stomach if it were nothing?
It must have been intentional.
Somerset stops. There are deep scratches here in the linoleum.
He fingers the grooves, then takes a piece of the plastic from the jar. He holds the piece to the floor, fiddles...  fits it into one of the scratches.
Somerset gets off the floor and looks down. These scratches are in front of the refrigerator. It looks like they were caused by the refrigerator having been pulled away from the wall and pushed back into place at some time.
SOMERSET
(to Mills)
Come here.
INT. APARTMENT, KITCHEN - LATER DAY
Mills and Somerset pull the refrigerator, rocking it back and forth away from the wall to get a clear view behind it. They strain, pull it a few more feet, and release.
Mills leans to look at the wall behind. Shock.
MILLS
Holy shit.
Somerset comes to look. Behind the refrigerator, there is a space on the wall where the dust has been wiped away. In that space, the words: ONE IS GLUTTONY. The letters have been smeared on in grease. A NOTE is pinned beside them.
INT. PRECINCT HOUSE, CAPTAIN'S OFFICE - EARLY EVENING
The captain's office is filled with pictures, books and mugsheets. Piles of paperwork abound, yet the office is meticulously well kept. The CAPTAIN, 50, sits at his tidy desk.
He wears a white shirt and conservative tie.
He's a calm man, but whenever he is not speaking, without fail, he clenches his jaw over and over, causing the muscles in his neck and jaw to pulse. Somerset and Mills sit before him.
SOMERSET
The bruises were caused by the muzzle
of a forty-five. So, there was a gun
against his head and he was given a
choice. Eat, or get your brains blown
out.
Somerset gets up to pace.
SOMERSET
He ate his fill, and was forced to
continue eating...  till his body
rejected the food. The killer held a
bucket under him, and then kept
serving. He took his time. The coroner
says this might have gone on for
more than twelve hours. The victim's
throat was swollen from the effort,
and there was probably a point where
he passed out. That's when killer
kicked him in the stomach. Popped
him.
MILLS
This was one sadistic motherfucker.
CAPTAIN
That seems obvious.
Somerset picks up a photocopy of the NOTE from behind the fridge.
SOMERSET
(reads)
"Dear Detectives, Long is the way,
and hard, that out of hell leads up
to light." It's the murderer's way
of announcing himself.
CAPTAIN
Announcing what?
SOMERSET
There are seven deadly sins. Gluttony,
wrath, greed... 
CAPTAIN
So what? This victim... 
SOMERSET
... envy, sloth, pride and lust. Seven.
CAPTAIN
Hey, so gluttony is one of the seven
deadly sins. But, this was a fat
guy. The killer may have felt this
was the just best way to torture
him. And, writing on the walls happens
all the time. It's like the
fashionable thing to do.
SOMERSET
One is gluttony.
The captain is disgruntled, clenching his jaw, looks at Mills.
MILLS
This is his stuff. I've been out in
the cold all day.
SOMERSET
This is a premeditated puzzle, and
it's only the beginning.
CAPTAIN
Always working up there, huh,
Somerset? Big brain's always cooking.
Somerset sits.
SOMERSET
I'm declining this case. I want us
reassigned.
MILLS
Whoa, whoa...  what?!
CAPTAIN
What's this: "I'm declining this
case?" It don't work that way.
SOMERSET
This can't be my last duty here. It
will go on and on.
CAPTAIN
I know what you're thinking, okay?
You don't want to get in bed with
this every night, but it's different
now. You're retiring. In six days
you're all the way gone.
Somerset shakes his head.
CAPTAIN
You've left unfinished business
before.
SOMERSET
Everything else was taken as close
to conclusion as humanly possible.
Also...  this shouldn't be his first
assignment.
MILLS
This isn't my first assignment,
dickhead. What the hell?
Mills stands, furious.
CAPTAIN
I don't have anyone else to give
this to, Somerset, you know that.
And nobody's going to swap with you.
MILLS
Give it to me.
CAPTAIN
How's that?
MILLS
There's nothing that says I have to
work with him. If Somerset wants
out, "goodbye." Give it to me.
The captain considers this.
SOMERSET
It's too soon for him.
MILLS
(to the captain)
Can we talk about this in private?
The captain looks at Somerset, then at Mills.
CAPTAIN
That's not necessary. You're in.
MILLS
Thank you.
CAPTAIN
Go start picking up the pieces. We'll
shuffle some paper and try to get
you a new partner.
Mills looks at Somerset, then leaves, closing the door. Somerset seems deflated, staring at the floor. He looks at the captain.
CAPTAIN
You win, Somerset. You're out.
INSERT -- TITLE CARD
TUESDAY
EXT. CITY STREET - DAY
A newspaper vendor lays out a pile of tabloid newspapers at the front of his busy newsstand.
The papers' headline is: BIZARRE MURDER!, in huge, black print.
The vendor lays out another tabloid pile. Headline: "EAT OR DIE" SAYS GLUTTONY KILLER!!, in big, red letters.
The vendor throws down a third tabloid stack. SICKENING MURDER -- EXCLUSIVE DETAILS INSIDE!, it reads.
INT. PRECINCT HOUSE, SOMERSET'S OFFICE - DAY
The office is old, with a single window which faces a billboard.
TRAFFIC is HEARD from outside. There are moving boxes on the floor. Somerset is at his desk with paperwork in two sloppy piles. He uses a manual typewriter, filling in a yellow form.
He types hunt-and-peck, slowly. He finishes the form and pulls it out. There is a knock at the door.
SOMERSET
Come in.
The captain pushes the door and stands in the doorway with a PAINTER/WORKMAN at his side.
CAPTAIN
Excuse us. We have some business to
take care of.
As always, the neatly groomed captain clenches his jaw.
Somerset lines a new form in the typewriter, starts typing.
The captain strolls in. Two boxes sit on the floor with DETECTIVE MILLS written across them. He picks up one of the boxes and sets it on top of the other.
At the open door, the workman takes a razor blade from his kit. He brings it against the writing on the glass of the door: DETECTIVE SOMERSET. The workman pushes the razor to start scraping the name away, and the razor on glass sounds like fingernails on a blackboard.
Somerset looks up.
WORKMAN
Sorry.
Somerset turns back to the typing, hunt-and-peck. The captain watches. The workman continues.
CAPTAIN
Have you heard?
SOMERSET
(not looking up)
No, I haven't heard.
CAPTAIN
There was a second.
Somerset stops, looks at the captain.
SOMERSET
Already.
CAPTAIN
Greed. It was written in blood.
Somerset thinks about this, then turns to type.
SOMERSET
It's none of my business anymore.
CAPTAIN
I thought you might want to be filled
in.
SOMERSET
I'm sure everyone's doing their best.
CAPTAIN
Yeah.
SOMERSET
Good.
Hunt-and-peck. The captain's jowls clamp. He steps up to Somerset's desk, begins to straighten the two piles of forms.
CAPTAIN
Come on. What are you going to do
with yourself out there?
SOMERSET
I'll get a job, maybe on a farm.
I'll work on the house.
CAPTAIN
Can't you feel it yet? Can't you
feel that feeling... ? You're not
going to be a cop anymore.
SOMERSET
What are you talking about?
CAPTAIN
You know.
Somerset reclines, facing the captain.
SOMERSET
Did you read in the paper today,
about the man who was walking his
dog? He was attacked, and his wallet
and his watch were taken. And then,
while he was still lying unconscious,
his attacker stabbed him with a knife
in both eyes. It happened four blocks
from here.
CAPTAIN
I heard.
SOMERSET
I have no understanding of this place
anymore.
CAPTAIN
It's always been like this.
SOMERSET
Really?
Somerset saddles up to the typewriter.
SOMERSET
Maybe you're right.
The captain lays the paperwork down. Both piles are now neat.
CAPTAIN
You do this work. You were made for
it, and I don't think you can deny
that. I certainly can't believe you're
trading it in for a tool belt and a
fishing rod.
(pause, walks to leave)
Maybe I'm wrong.
The captain leaves. Somerset looks up. He grabs the paperwork piles and ruffles them back to their disheveled state. He looks up at the workman.
The workman is looking at Somerset, has a rag in his hand to remove the last remnants of Somerset's name.
SOMERSET
(angrily)
Try putting a little elbow grease
into it.
The workman is startled, continues his work.
INT. SOMERSET'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - LATE NIGHT
There is a dart board on one wall. THWACK -- Somerset's switchblade hits the board and embeds.
Somerset crosses the nearly empty living room and takes the blade from the dart board. He walks back to stand in front of the only chair in the room. He throws the switchblade.
It embeds in the dart board. Somerset sits.
He picks a book off the floor and holds it in his lap. KIDS can be HEARD CURSING and playing LOUD MUSIC from outside the shuttered window. Somerset stares at the ceiling. He opens the book and looks at the pages...  stares at the pages... 
He puts the book back down on the floor.
EXT. CITY STREET - LATE NIGHT
Somerset gets out of his car. He walks down the sidewalk with a notebook in hand. THUNDER is HEARD. He takes a cigarette out of a full pack and lights it.
He walks along the avenue. Cars race by in the street. People
walk briskly past. At a public phone, a man shouts curses angrily into the phone, then starts pounding the phone box with the receiver. A fire engine passes in the street, sirens, horn and lights going full blast.
Somerset starts up a flight of massive stone stairs, past several sleeping vagrants. One VAGRANT sits up and looks to Somerset.
VAGRANT
Spare me a cigarette? Spare a
cigarette?
SOMERSET
Sorry, last one.
Ahead of Somerset, the library looms, a solid, powerful structure.
INT. PUBLIC LIBRARY, MAIN LIBRARY - LATE NIGHT
Somerset and GEORGE, 62, the night guard, enter the vast space of the deserted main library.
The lamps hanging from the ceiling give off a warm, pleasant glow over mahogany tables and chairs. To each side of this center area are tall bookshelves. Balconies surround the room on all four sides; three levels which overlook the center.
Somerset is happy. This is his element, this peaceful, elegant place. George motions to the long, empty tables.
GEORGE
Sit where you'd like.
SOMERSET
Thanks, George.
MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
Hey there, Smilely.
Somerset looks up to the top balcony where TWO OTHER SECURITY GUARDS and one JANITOR look over the banister.
SOMERSET
Evening, gentlemen.
They all say their hellos.
FIRST GUARD
Come on, George. Cards are getting
cold.
GEORGE
(to Somerset)
Duty calls.
George pumps Somerset's hand, then moves to a stairwell
leading to the balconies. Somerset walks down the main aisle, looks around at the shelves and shelves of books.
George reaches the top balcony and the others sit at a card table where a poker game is in progress.
Somerset puts his notebook down on one table and switches on a green banker's lamp. THUNDER SOUNDS. Somerset looks up.
Rain is beginning to fall on the windows of the high ceiling.
SOMERSET
(shouts up)
All these books, gentlemen...  a world
of knowledge at your disposal, and
you play poker all night.
UP ON THE BALCONY
George has taken a huge BOOM-BOX from a broom closet.
JANITOR
We got culture.
SECOND GUARD
(dealing cards)
Yeah, we got culture coming out our
asses.
They laugh. George sets the boom-box against the railing of the balcony so the speakers face towards Somerset.
DOWN ON THE MAIN FLOOR
Somerset has gone into one bookshelf aisle. Poker table conversation echoes from above. Somerset searches books, reading spines. He finds one book and pulls it, continues searching.
UP ON THE BALCONY
George hits play on the boom-box and turns the volume way up.
GEORGE
How's this for culture?
DOWN ON THE MAIN FLOOR
Somerset keeps looking for books. From far away come the strains of MOZART MUSIC filling the air. High, drifting music, such as AIR (On the G string.) Somerset stops, listens.
He closes his eyes and soaks it in.
UP ON THE BALCONY
George sits at the card table, takes out a cigar and lights up. He looks to the ground floor.
GEORGE
Where'd you get to, Smilely?
Below, Somerset comes out from the aisle.
DOWN ON THE MAIN FLOOR
Somerset looks up at George.
SOMERSET
Thank you.
INT. PUBLIC LIBRARY, MAIN LIBRARY - LATER NIGHT
MUSIC CONTINUES, spinning through the air like a slow, cool breeze.
Somerset walks, surrounded by books, carrying several. He pulls another off a shelf and adds it to his pile.
UP ON THE BALCONY
George lays down a winning hand. The others toss in their cards in disgust. George laughs, spouting cigar smoke.
Cigar smoke floats up in the air, thinning gracefully. Above, rain continues dancing on the ceiling windows.
DOWN ON THE MAIN FLOOR
Somerset sits, opens a book on the table and reads.
INT. MILLS' APARTMENT, BEDROOM/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
MUSIC CONTINUES, uninterrupted over this scene. Music so pretty it is almost sad. Tracy, in a nightgown, sits up in bed, tense, She throws off the covers and goes to the door.
She stands looking into the living room where Mills is at a desk.
Mills sorts through paperwork and photos with his back to Tracy.
A basketball game is on the television, but he pays it no mind.
He sits forward, obviously frustrated, drinks coffee. He does not know Tracy is there.
Tracy watches her husband, concerned.
INT. PUBLIC LIBRARY, MAIN LIBRARY - NIGHT
MUSIC CONTINUES. Somerset has two books open. He opens his notebook and brings a pen to bear. Writes:
SEVEN DEADLY SINS
GLUTTONY
GREED
WRATH
LUST
PRIDE
ENVY
SLOTH
