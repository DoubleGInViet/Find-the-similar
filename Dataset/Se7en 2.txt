George and the guys finish another hand. George looks down at Somerset, who is writing in the notebook. George takes up the cards and starts shuffling.
GEORGE
(down to Somerset)
You know, Smilely...  you're really
going to miss us.
George shuffles again, but they flip wrong and a few go off the table, over the balcony.
DOWN ON THE MAIN FLOOR
Somerset looks up at George, then looks around.
SOMERSET
I just might.
ABOVE
The cards George dropped are fluttering, flipping downwards.
INT. PRECINCT HOUSE, SOMERSET'S OFFICE - EARLY EVENING
The office is dark. Somerset is at his desk, writing:
DETECTIVE MILLS, YOU MAY WANT TO LOOK AT THE FOLLOWING BOOKS, RELATING TO THE SEVEN DEADLY SINS:
DANTE'S PURGATORY
THE CANTERBURY TALES -- THE PARSON'S TALE
DICTIONARY OF CATHOLICISM
INT. PRECINCT HOUSE, SOMERSET'S OFFICE - LATER EVENING
Somerset lays an envelope on top of the two boxes which have Detective Mills' name on them. The envelope reads: MILLS.
INSERT -- TITLE CARD
WEDNESDAY
INT. PRECINCT HOUSE, SOMERSET'S OFFICE - MORNING
Somerset pushes the door open and notices "DETECTIVE MILLS" painted on the glass. Rain falls outside. Somerset goes to his desk, but stops. All his belongings have been moved to a small, temporary desk in the corner.
Somerset moves to open the top left drawer of the big desk.
Empty. He goes to the temporary desk and urgently searches through the boxes of papers and files...  finds what he was looking for. He holds a small frame which fits in his palm.
Inside the frame is a PHOTO of an attractive WOMAN. Somerset pops the frame open, looks at the picture, then puts the picture in his wallet.
Somerset sits at the temporary desk. He begins to sort through his papers. After a moment, he glances over his shoulder. The envelope he left for Mills is gone.
EXT. UPSCALE CITY BLOCK - MORNING
It's raining. At one high-rent office building, many business men and women are coming and going in a lunch-hour hurry. Just to one side of the building, the CORONER'S WAGON drives out from the mouth of the parking garage into the rain. People on the sidewalk have to stop to let it cross to the street.
At the same time, a large Lincoln Towncar turns off the street, heads into the bowels of the garage.
EXT. UPSCALE BUILDING, UNDERGROUND GARAGE - MORNING
Many police cars and news vans here, and police men and reporters and photographers everywhere. Mills, looking haggard, finishes a conversation with a TALL COP by the
service elevator.
MILLS
... good. Do it. I'm going back up.
Tall Cop hurries away as Mills pushes repeatedly on the service elevator button. The elevator doors open and Mills steps in. As the door are shutting, a COMMOTION is HEARD. Mills stops the door and looks out.
Across the garage, the Towncar is pulling to a stop and reporters are rushing to it. FLASHBULBS are FLASHING.
MARTIN TALBOT, 47, impressive and well dressed, steps out of the car and faces the reporters as they start shouting questions.
In the service elevator, Mills lets the doors slide shut.
INT. UPSCALE BUILDING, SERVICE AREA - MORNING
The service elevator opens to a dark physical plant room. Mills exits the elevator and crosses past humming air-conditioning vents, dripping pipes and janitor's lockers. To a door... 
INT. UPSCALE BUILDING, OFFICE CORRIDOR - MORNING
Mills comes out the service area door into a bright, ritzy hallway. This hall and the doors along it reek of money. A few cops are standing around. Ahead there's a police line, which Mills ducks under on his way to stately mahogany doors.
INT. LAW OFFICE - MORNING
A huge law office. A television is on in one corner, showing the news. Windows overlook the rain wet city. Two FORENSICS dust for prints, whispering to each other when Mills enters.
FORENSIC ONE
(to other forensic)
... going to screw it up. I swear... 
I've seen... 
The other forensic clears his throat, getting back to work.
Forensic One shuts up. Mills notices this, weary.
MILLS
How's it coming?
FORENSIC ONE
Nothing yet.
Mills watches them a moment, then turns his attention to another part of the office. A leather chair sits in an open area.
The chair and the carpet under it are covered in a goodly
portion of brown, dried blood.
There is a trail of dripped blood from the chair to a large desk.
On a cleared off section of the desk, a two-armed, counter balance SCALE sits, also blood stained. The desk has been dusted. Behind the desk, GREED is written on the wall in blood, near a modern art painting.
Mills stands staring at this area. The TELEVISION is HEARD:
ANCHOR (V.O.)
(from television)
... going cut in live downtown right
now, where Defense Attorney Eli Gould
was found murdered in his office
late last night. District Attorney
Martin Talbot is taking questions
from reporters... 
ON T.V., Talbot comes on screen, a powerful presence, with a gold tooth in the front of his mouth. It's from down in the garage.
A REPORTER (V.O.)
(from television)
... a small conflict of interest here?
I mean, your prosecutors have lost
more than a few very high profile
cases to Mister Gould and his defense
team... 
TALBOT (V.O.)
(from television)
Now, that's ridiculous to the point
of almost being offensive. There's
no conflict of interest whatsoever,
and any claim that there would be,
or could be, is irresponsible.
Other reporters begin to shout questions, but Talbot's not done.
TALBOT (V.O.)
Now, hold on...  I want to address
that. I've just come from a meeting
with law enforcement officials, and
they've assured me they put their
best people on this thing.
Mills turns to looks at Talbot on the screen.
TALBOT (V.O.)
You just wait and see how quickly we
get a handle on it. This will be the
very definition of swift justice.
Mills walks to turn the t.v. off.
MILLS
(quietly to t.v.)
Shut the fuck up.
He turns and looks to see the forensics looking at him. The forensics look away.
Mills walks away from the t.v., to a picture frame on the floor.
The frame has been placed specifically in the center of the room, facing the doors.
It is a photo if a falsely pretty, middle-aged woman, smiling and wearing pearls. On the glass of the frame, two circles have been drawn with blood around the woman's eyes.
Mills sits on the floor, stares at the photo.
INT. MILLS' CAR - MORNING
Mills gets in and slams the door. He is alone with the sound of the rain. He wipes water from his face and looks at his tired eyes in the rear view mirror. He leans over to the glove compartment and takes out two newly purchased paperbacks: The Canterbury Tales and Dante's Purgatory.
Mills makes a face and opens Dante's Purgatory to a bookmark.
He rests the book on the steering wheel. He reads.
He bites his lip, leaning close to the words.
He is really concentrating, mouths some of the words to himself. He finally shakes his head and closes the book, not understanding a word of it. Pause. He starts pounding the book against the steering wheel with all his might.
MILLS
Fucking, Dante, goddamn, poetry-
writing, faggot motherfucker... 
Mills throws the book against the windshield, then puts his head back and closes his eyes, trying to calm. A long moment. Quiet.
BANG, BANG, BANG -- there's a loud BANGING on the window and Mills looks up, startled... 
Tall Cop is at the window in rain gear. Mills rolls it down.
Tall Cop hands a wet paper bag through.
MILLS
Good work, Officer. Good work.
Mills rolls the window up, rips the bag open. Inside: Cliff Notes for Dante's Purgatory and for The Canterbury Tales.
MILLS
Thank God.
INT. PRECINCT HOUSE, SOMERSET'S OFFICE - DAY
It still rains outside. Somerset sits at the big desk which is now Mills'. He fills out form by hand as Mills enters with a ton of his own paperwork. Somerset looks up.
SOMERSET
(gathers his things)
Let me get out of your way.
Mills sets his paperwork on the desk. He is beat. Somerset moves to the temporary desk. They both sit and settle in, organizing, not looking at each other.
Both attend to their work. Here are two men, about five feet apart, each trying not to acknowledge the other's presence.
Mills takes his Cliff Notes out, looks to see Somerset is occupied, and hides them in a desk drawer.
Somerset finishes one form, flips it and looks at Mills. Mills sorts through photos from the greed murder. Somerset continues writing. PHONE RINGS. Both men look at it. Phone rings again.
SOMERSET
It's a package deal. You get the
phone with the office.
MILLS
(picks up, into phone)
Detective Mills here.
(listens, lowers voice)
Honey...  I asked you not to call me
here. I'll call you back... 
(listens)
What? Why?
Mills is very confused.
MILLS
(into phone)
Why? Okay...  okay, hold on.
Mills clears his throat and holds out the phone to Somerset.
MILLS
It's my wife.
SOMERSET
What?
Mills shrugs. Somerset stands, takes the phone.
SOMERSET
(into phone)
Hello?
(listens)
Yes, well...  it's nice to speak to
you.
(listens)
Well, I appreciate the thought... 
but... 
(listens)
Then, I guess I'd be delighted.
Thank you very much. Yes...  goodbye.
Somerset hangs up, shakes his head.
MILLS
Well?
SOMERSET
I'm invited to have a late supper at
your house. And, I accept.
MILLS
How's that?
SOMERSET
Tonight.
Mills is lost. Somerset goes to sit back down.
MILLS
I don't even know if I'm having dinner
there tonight.
INT. MILLS' APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM/KITCHENETTE - NIGHT
Food is cooking on the stove. Tracy is in the living room area carefully setting the table with good silver and china.
The door to the apartment is HEARD OPENING and CLOSING. Mills and Somerset come down a short hallway. Mills carries a brand new briefcase.
TRACY
Hello, men. You made it.
MILLS
Hi, honey.
Mills gives Tracy a kiss, then presents Somerset.
MILLS
I'd like you to meet Somerset.
SOMERSET
Hello.
Somerset shakes Tracy's hand lightly.
TRACY
It's nice to meet you. My husband
has told me a lot about you...  except
your first name.
SOMERSET
Oh...  um, William.
TRACY
It's a nice name. William, I'd like
you to meet David.
(to Mills)
David...  William.
Mills smiles and nods this off, heading across the room.
MILLS
Great...  I'm, uh, just going to put
these things away.
Mills moves to the adjoining bedroom. Somerset stands with his hands folded in front of him.
SOMERSET
It smells good.
TRACY
What? Oh, yes. I mean, thank you.
(motions to the table)
Please, sit down.
Somerset takes off his jacket. Tracy goes to check on the food.
TRACY
You can put that over on the couch.
You'll have to excuse all the mess.
We're still unpacking.
Somerset notices something on Mills' desk. It's a medal, in a small, clear case amongst the papers and pens.
SOMERSET
I hear you and Mills were high school
sweethearts.
TRACY
High school and college, yes. Pretty
hokey, huh? I knew on our first date
this was the man I was going to marry.
God...  he was the funniest man I'd
ever met.
SOMERSET
Really?
Somerset has to think about that one for a second. He picks the medal up: a medal for valor from the Police Department.
SOMERSET
Well, it's rare these days...  that
kind of commitment.
He puts the medal down. Tracy is looking at the gun strapped under Somerset's arm as Somerset starts to unstrap it.
SOMERSET
(about the gun)
Don't worry. I don't wear it at the
dinner table.
TRACY
No matter how often I see guns, I
still can't get used to them.
Somerset lays the gun with his jacket.
SOMERSET
Same here.
Tracy smiles. Somerset goes to the table and transfers a small notebook from his breast pocket to his pants pocket. A piece of paper falls to the floor, closer to Tracy.
TRACY
Anyway...  what girl wouldn't want
the captain of the football team as
their lifetime mate? Here...  you
dropped something... 
Tracy picks it up. It is the pale, paper rose. She looks at it as she hands it back to Somerset, who is self-conscious.
TRACY
What is that?
Somerset looks at the rose, then puts it away.
SOMERSET
My future.
Tracy tilts her head, looking at Somerset.
TRACY
You have a strange way about you... 
I mean interesting. I'm sorry. It's
really none of my business. It's
just nice to meet a man who talks
like that.
(goes back to stove)
If David saw that paper, he'd say
you're a fag. That's how he is.
SOMERSET
(smiles)
I guess I won't be showing it to him
then.
INT. MILLS' APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - LATER NIGHT
A record player on a moving box PLAYS QUIET MUSIC. Tracy, Mills and Somerset are eating. Mills has a beeper beside his plate and occasionally fingers it absently.
TRACY
Why aren't you married, William?
MILLS
Tracy...  what the hell?
Somerset pokes at the napkin, thinking.
SOMERSET
I was close once. It just didn't
happen.
TRACY
It surprises me. It really does.
SOMERSET
Any person who spends a significant
amount of time with me finds me... 
disagreeable. Just ask your husband.
MILLS
Very true.
Mills grins, but he means it.
TRACY
(to Somerset)
How long have you lived here?
SOMERSET
Too long.
(drinks)
What do you think so far?
Tracy glances immediately to Mills.
MILLS
It takes time to settle in.
Somerset can see it is a sore subject.
SOMERSET
Well, you can get numb to it pretty
quickly. There are things in any
city... 
A LOW RUMBLING is HEARD. Plates on the table begin to clatter.
MILLS
Subway train.
The dishes clatter more. Coffee cups clink against their saucers. Tracy holds her coffee cup to stop it and smiles at Somerset to act like it's nothing, but she is clearly bothered.
TRACY
It'll go away in a minute.
They wait. The rumbling grows louder, knocks something over in the sink. Somerset continues eating, fiddles with his food. The record player skips, then plays on. The clattering dies down.
Mills seems uncomfortable.
MILLS
This real estate guy...  this miserable
fuck, he brought us to see this place
a few times. And, first I'm thinking
he's good, really efficient. But
then, I started wondering, why does
he keep hurrying us along? Why will
he only show us this place for like
five minutes at a time?
Mills laughs lamely.
TRACY
We found out the first night.
Somerset tries to stay straight, but he can't help laughing.
SOMERSET
The soothing, relaxing, vibrating
home. Sorry... 
He laughs harder, covering his mouth. Tracy and Mills laugh.
MILLS
Oh, fuck.
INT. MILLS' APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - LATER NIGHT
The record player plays another album. Tracy brings over a pot of coffee and pours. Mills and Somerset have beers.
TRACY
I don't think I've ever met anyone
who doesn't have a television before.
That's...  weird.
MILLS
It's un-American is what it is.
SOMERSET
All television does is teach children
that it's really cool to be stupid
and eat candy bars all day.
MILLS
What about sports?
SOMERSET
What about them?
Tracy brings over a plate of cookies and puts it on the table.
MILLS
You go to movies at least?
SOMERSET
I read. Remember reading?
MILLS
I just have to say, I can't respect
any man who's never seen "Green
Acres."
Somerset gives a blank stare. Tracy walks across the room.
MILLS
You've never seen "The Odd Couple?"
This is sick. "The Honeymooners?!"
SOMERSET
I vaguely recall a large, angry man,
and someone called Norton.
Tracy turns the record player down further, then goes into the bedroom and shuts the door behind her.
Somerset and Mills look a the closed door. A long moment. They look at each other, then sit for a time. Somerset puts down his beer, sighs. He looks around.
INT. MILLS' APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM
The only sounds are from the city outside. The living room table has been cleared and its surface is now covered with various forms, reports and 8" by 10" photographs. Mills and Somerset are both standing. Mills guides Somerset through the photos.
MILLS
Our guy got into office, probably
before the building closed and
security tightened up. Gould must
have been working late.
SOMERSET
I'm certain. He was the biggest
defense lawyer around. Infamous,
actually.
MILLS
Well, his body was found Monday night,
okay? But, get this...  the office
was closed all day Monday. Which
means, as long as the gluttony killing
was done before the weekend, our
killer could've gotten in here on
Friday. He could've spent all day
Saturday with Gould, and all day
Sunday.
Mills picks up one photo and shows it to Somerset. Long shot: it shows the greed murder scene. Gould sits dead in the leather chair, near the desk where the counter-balance scale sits.
MILLS
Gould was tied down, nude. The killer
left his arms free and handed him a
big, sharp butcher's knife. See... 
the scale here.
Mills pulls another photo. Close up: the two-armed scale. In one suspended plate is a one pound weight. In the other is a hunk of flesh.
SOMERSET
A pound of flesh.
Mills digs, comes up with a photocopy of a hand-scrawled note.
SOMERSET
(reading note)
"One pound of flesh, no more no less.
No cartilage, no bone, but only flesh.
This task done...  and he would go
free."
Mills takes out one photo showing the note pinned to the wall beside where "greed" is written in blood.
MILLS
The leather chair was soaked through
with sweat.
SOMERSET
(nods, grim)
All day Saturday, and all day Sunday.
(pause)
The murderer would want Gould to
take his time. To have to sit there
and decide. Where do you make the
first cut? There's a gun in your
face...  but, what part of your body
is expendable?
MILLS
He cut along the side of his stomach.
The love handle.
Somerset's still studying the photos.
SOMERSET
He must have left another puzzle
piece.
MILLS
Look, I appreciate being able to
talk this out, but, uh... 
SOMERSET
This is just to satisfy my curiosity.
I'm still leaving town Saturday.
Mills is very tired. He rubs his eyes, then walks to take one more photo from his briefcase. It is the photo of the framed picture of the falsely pretty woman with her eyes circled in blood.
MILLS
Gould's wife. She was away on
business. If this means she saw
anything, I don't know what. We've
questioned her at least five times.
SOMERSET
And, if it's a threat.
MILLS
We put her in a safe house.
Somerset nods. He puts down the photos he's holding. He begins spreading all the pictures out.
SOMERSET
Look at these with fresh eyes. Don't
see what the killer wants you to.
Don't let him guide you... 
While he speaks, Somerset keeps shifting the photos, for example: covering the corpse in one with the edge of another.
SOMERSET
Even if the corpse is right there... 
it's almost like looking through it.
Editing out the initial shock. Look
at the room.
In the photos, there's the scale. The note on the wall.
Shelves of books. The Modern Art painting.
GREED written in blood.
SOMERSET
He's preaching.
MILLS
Punishing.
SOMERSET
The sins were used in medieval
sermons. There were seven cardinal
virtues, and then seven deadly sins,
created as a learning tool, because
they distract from true worship.
MILLS
Like in the Parson's Tale, and Dante.
SOMERSET
Did you read them?
MILLS
Yeah. Parts of them. Anyway, in
Purgatory, Dante and his buddy are
climbing up that big mountain... 
seeing all these other guys who
sinned... 
SOMERSET
Seven Terraces of Purgation.
MILLS
Right. But there, pride comes first,
not gluttony. The sins are in a
different order.
SOMERSET
For now, let's just consider the
books as the murderer's inspiration.
The books and sermons are about
atonement for sin. And, these murders
have been like forced attrition.
MILLS
Forced what?
SOMERSET
Attrition. When you regret your sins,
but not because you love God.
MILLS
Like, because someone's holding a
gun on you.
Mills runs his hands across his face, walks to the fridge to get beer. Somerset keeps looking at photos and papers.
SOMERSET
No fingerprints?
MILLS
Nothing.
SOMERSET
Totally unrelated victims.
Mills nods, drinking from a beer.
SOMERSET
No witnesses of any kind?
MILLS
None. Which I don't understand. He
had to get back out.
Somerset sits in a chair, picks up the photo of the wife.
Runs his fingers over the eyes circled in blood.
SOMERSET
In any major city, minding your own
business is a perfected science.
There's a public crime prevention
course offered at the precinct house
once a month. The first thing they
teach is that you should never cry
"help." Always scream "fire," because
people don't want to get caught up
in anything. But a fire...  that's an
evening's entertainment. They come
running.
Looking at the wife's photo.
SOMERSET
This is the one thing.
MILLS
I know.
SOMERSET
(holds photo up)
What if it's not that she's seen
something? What if she's supposed to
see something, but she just hasn't
been given a chance to see it yet?
MILLS
Okay. But, what?
INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT
The room is like a hotel room. Mills stands beside the woman from the picture, MRS. GOULD. Mills shows her photos from the murder scene. The photos have been covered in sections
to hide the Mr. Gould's corpse. Mrs. Gould is crying. Somerset is on the other side of the room, holding more photos.
MILLS
I'm sorry about this, Mrs. Gould. I
really am.
MRS GOULD
I...  I don't understand.
Mills helps her flip through the photos. He isn't too keen to put her through this.
MILLS
I need you to look at each one
carefully...  very carefully. Look
for anything that seems strange or
out of place. Anything at all.
MRS GOULD
I don't know why...  why now?
MILLS
Please, I need you to help me if
we're going to get who did this.
Mrs. Gould sobs quietly, wipes her tears.
MILLS
Anything...  anything missing or
different.
MRS GOULD
I don't see anything.
MILLS
Are you absolutely certain?
MRS GOULD
I can't do this now...  please.
Mills looks to Somerset, looks at the photos Somerset holds.
MILLS
Maybe we better wait.
Somerset looks at the photos in his hand. These show Mr.
Gould's corpse in the chair, not covered in any way.
SOMERSET
It should be now. There may be
something we're not seeing.
MRS GOULD
Wait. Here... 
MILLS
What is it?
Mrs. Gould points at the modern art painting on the wall in one photo. The painting is just splattered paint, abstract.
MRS GOULD
This painting... 
MILLS
What?
MRS GOULD
Why is this painting hanging upside-
down?
Mills turns to look at Somerset.
INT. LAW OFFICE - NIGHT
Where the greed murder took place. Somerset, wearing gloves,
reaches to take the modern art painting off the wall. Mills near, watching.
SOMERSET
You're sure your men didn't move
this?
MILLS
Even if they did, those photos were
taken before forensics.
Nothing on the wall behind the painting. Blank space.
MILLS
Nothing.
SOMERSET
It's got to be.
Somerset puts the painting down, resting it on its bottom edge.
The painting is backed by a thick sheet of brown papers stapled into the wooden frame. Somerset points to where the wire's eye screws used to be screwed into the frame, and to where it has been re-screwed.
SOMERSET
He changed the wire to rehang it.
Somerset takes out his switchblade. Mills is surprised.
MILLS
What the fuck is that?
SOMERSET
A switchblade.
Somerset cuts along the edge of the brown paper to get to the hollow space between it and the back of the canvas. He cuts out the entire sheet. Mills helps pull it away. Nothing. Empty.
Mills looks at both sides of the paper, then tosses it away.
MILLS
Nothing. Damn it!
Somerset lays the painting face up on the floor. He pokes his finger on the painted surface. He brings the flat of his blade against the painting, tries to peel some of the paint.
MILLS
The killer didn't paint the fucking
thing. Give it up.
Somerset pushes the painting away, frustrated.
SOMERSET
There must be something.
MILLS
We're screwed. He's fucking with us.
Somerset backs away from the wall, staring at the space where the painting hung. There is only a nail. He turns, looking around the office, then crosses.
Mills puts his hands to his temple, furious, picks up a lamp and throws it to the floor, venting.
MILLS
Motherfucker!
Across the room, Somerset falls to his knees and pulls open a forensics kit. He takes out a fingerprint brush, examining the bristles. Mills sees this.
MILLS
What?
SOMERSET
Bear with me.
Somerset goes back to the wall where the painting was. He pulls over a chair, gets on it and starts brushing near the nail.
MILLS
Oh, yeah, sure.	You got to be
kidding?!
SOMERSET
Just wait!
Somerset brushes with a few wider strokes. He leans close, studies the powder residue. Leans closer still. Pause.
SOMERSET
Call the print lab.
INT. MILLS' APARTMENT, BEDROOM - NIGHT
Tracy is asleep, dressed, with the lights still on. She stirs, then awakens and sits up slowly. She squints from the light, sweaty and uncomfortable. She looks around and listens. All she hears is traffic.
EXT. MILLS' APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
FROM OUTSIDE, looking into the apartment, we see Tracy come in from the bedroom. She sees Mills and Somerset are gone. She comes to open a window, then goes to the kitchen area.
We're still LOOKING IN	at	her	as she	starts the dishes in
the	sink. The RUMBLING	of	the	SUBWAY	TRAIN is HEARD starting.
The	room begins to rattle, as	before.
Tracy looks out into the living room, ill at ease.
INT. LAW OFFICE - NIGHT
The male forensic from the gluttony murder scene is here. He has a magnifying glass which he's using to study a very clear fingerprint in black powder on the wall.
MALE FORENSIC
Oh, man... 
MILLS (O.S.)
Talk to me.
The male forensic bites his lip, still studying.
Mills and Somerset are watching the forensic who works O.S.
MILLS
(to Somerset)
Just, honestly...  have you ever seen
anything like this...  been involved
in anything like this?
SOMERSET
No.
MALE FORENSIC (O.S.)
Well, I can tell you, boys... 
The forensic steps down from a stool. Behind him, where the painting once was, are fingerprints, clear and distinct. The prints have been left, one after the other, to form letters which form words: HELP ME.
MALE FORENSIC
... just by looking at the shape of
the underloop on these, they are not
the victim's fingerprints.
INT. PRECINCT HOUSE, PRINT LAB - NIGHT
Dark. A TECHNICIAN sits before an old computer. The computer's green screen shows enlarged fingerprint patterns being aligned, compares, and then rejected: whir - click - whir - click - whir - click. Mills and Somerset watch, bathed in a green glow.
MILLS
He just may be nuts enough.
SOMERSET
It doesn't fit. He doesn't want us
to help him stop.
MILLS
Who the hell knows? There's plenty
of freaks out there doing dirty deeds
they don't want to do. You know... 
little voices tell them bad things.
Somerset doesn't buy it. The technician adjusts a knob, then turns to the detectives.
TECHNICIAN
I've seen this baby take as long as
three days to make a match, so you
guys can go cross your fingers
somewhere else.
INT. PRECINCT HOUSE, HALLWAY - NIGHT
Somerset and Mills come out from the Print Lab. A janitor is mopping the hall. The computer is HEARD WHIRing AND CLICKing onwards. Somerset sits with a groan on a couch outside the lab door. Mills flops beside him.
SOMERSET
You meant what you said to Mrs. Gould,
didn't you? About catching this guy.
You really want to believe that,
don't you?
MILLS
And you don't?
SOMERSET
(laughs, very tired)
I wish I still thought like you.
MILLS
Then, you tell me what you think
we're doing.
SOMERSET
All we do is pick up the pieces. We
take all the evidence, and all the
pictures and samples. We write
everything down and note what time
things happened... 
MILLS
Oh, that's all.
SOMERSET
We put it in a nice neat pile and
file it away, on the slim chance
it's ever needed in a courtroom.
(pause)
It's like collecting diamonds on a
desert island. You keep them just in
case you ever get rescued, but it's
a pretty big ocean out there.
MILLS
Bullshit.
SOMERSET
I'm, sorry, but even the most
promising clues usually lead only to
other clues. I've seen so many corpses
rolled away...  unrevenged.
MILLS
I've seen the same. I'm not the
country hick you seem to think I am.
SOMERSET
In this city, if all the skeletons
came out of all the closets...  if
ever hidden body were to suddenly
rise again, there'd be no more room
for the living.
Somerset slumps back, takes out a cigarette and lights it.
MILLS
Don't tell me you didn't get that
rush tonight...  that adrenalin, like
we were getting somewhere.
Mills sits back on the couch, closes his eyes.
MILLS
And, don't try to tell me it was
because you found something that
would play well in a courtroom.
Somerset looks at Mills, who crosses his arms to sleep.
Somerset puffs the cigarette.
The computer is heard: whir - click - whir - click... 
INSERT -- TITLE CARD
THURSDAY
INT. PRECINCT HOUSE, HALLWAY - EARLY MORNING
Mills and Somerset are fast asleep on the couch, leaning against each other. People pass and look at them strangely.
A man steps in front of the couch. He reaches with both hands to slap their faces simultaneously.
It's the captain leaning over them.
CAPTAIN
Wake up, Glimmer Twins. We have a
winner.
INT. PRECINCT HOUSE, READY ROOM - EARLY MORNING
A windowless classroom. The captain stands at a podium in front with a white screen at his side. A mug-shot of a man, VICTOR, 25, is projected onto the screen from a slide projector.
CAPTAIN
He goes by the name Victor, as many
of you know, and his prints were
found on scene by Detectives Mills
and Somerset.
FIVE	hardened	POLICE	OFFICERS, four men and one	woman, sit
in chairs facing the	captain. The all wear bullet-proof vests
with	the word	POLICE	spray-painted across them.
Somerset and Mills sit in back, drinking coffee, still asleep.
CAPTAIN
Now, this guy's a real beauty. He
has a long, long history of serious
mental illness. According the head-
shrinkers, it seems his parents gave
him a very strict, Southern Baptist
upbringing, but somewhere along the
line he dropped his marbles.
Two of the cops in the front row are talking.
CAPTAIN
Hey, you two can shut-up now!
The two cops separate like huge, embarassed school children.
CAPTAIN
Thank you, fuckheads. Now, Victor
spent a couple of months in prison
for the attempted rape of an eight
year old boy, but his lawyer made
sure he didn't stay long. Before
that, he dabbled in drugs, armed
robbery and assault. We've been doing
our best to keep an eye on him, but
he's been out of circulation for a
while.
FEMALE COP
If he disappeared, what do you want
from us?
CAPTAIN
His last place of residence is still
in his name. A search warrant is
being pushed through the courts as
we speak.
A red-headed cop, CALIFORNIA, raises his hand.
CALIFORNIA
So, have the housing cops walk up
and ring the doorbell.
The cops laugh. The captain is clenching his jaw, angry.
CAPTAIN
Listen, California. When you go in,
if Victor isn't home, one of his
buddies might be house-sitting, so
you go in guns first. Besides using,
Victor deals, and we know what kind
of crowd he runs with.
There is some chatter amongst the cops.
CAPTAIN
This is what the D.A. has a hard-on
for right now, Ladies and Germs, so
we do not question why.
Mills leans to Somerset while the captain continues the briefing.
They whisper.
MILLS
Does this make it with you?
SOMERSET
Doesn't seem like our man, does it?
MILLS
You tell me. I'm new in town.
SOMERSET
He doesn't have the desire somehow.
Our killer seems to have more purpose.
More purpose than Victor could ever
conceive of.
MILLS
The fingerprints.
SOMERSET
Yes. They were there...  so, it must
be.
MILLS
We'll tag along.
Somerset wants no part of that.
SOMERSET
Why would we?
MILLS
(smiles)
Satisfy our curiosity?
INT. MILLS' CAR - MORNING
Mills drives, follows a police van. Somerset rides shotgun.
Mills seems pumped and ready. Somerset takes two Rolaids off a fresh roll and chews them.
MILLS
You ever take one?
Somerset takes out his gun, opens it to check the load.
SOMERSET
Never in my twenty-four years, knock
on wood. I've only ever taken my gun
out five times with the actual
intention of using it. Never fired
it though. Not once.
(closes his gun)
You?
MILLS
Never took a bullet. I pulled my gun
once. Fired it once.
SOMERSET
And?
MILLS
It was my first one of these. We
were a secondary unit, and I was
pretty shaky going in. I was still
considered a rookie.
Mills takes a corner, tires screeching.
MILLS
We busted the door, looking for this
junkie, right? The geek just opened
fire. Another cop was hit in the arm
and he went flying...  like in slow
motion.
(pause)
I remember riding in the ambulance.
His arm was like Jello. A piece of
meat. He bled to death right there.
A pause.
SOMERSET
How did the fire fight end?
MILLS
I	got him. I got the son-of-a-bitch. See, I was doing really good up till then. Lots of street busts. I've always had this weird luck... 
everything always went my way, but this was wild.
(pause)
I got him with one shot...  right between the eyes. Next thing I know, the mayor's pinning a medal on me. Picture in the paper, whole nine yards.
Somerset unrolls the window, feels the air across his face.
SOMERSET
How was it?
MILLS
I expected it to be bad, you know. I
took a human life...  but I slept
like a baby that night. I never gave
it a second thought.
SOMERSET
I	think Hemingway wrote somewhere... 
I can't remember where, but he wrote that in order to live in a place like this, you have to have the ability to kill. I think he meant you truly must be able to do it, not just faking it, too survive.
MILLS
Sounds like he knew what he was
talking about.
INT. SLUM BUILDING, STAIRWELL - MORNING
The five cops from the briefing, fully geared up and ready, rifles and handguns out, move quickly up the stairs in single file. Somerset and Mills follow, guns out. Somerset is sweating bullets. Mills is wild eyed, juiced.
Crack viles and hypodermic needles on the stairs crunch under the cops' heavy boots.
INT. SLUM HALLWAY - MORNING
The cops enter the dank hall. The move cautiously. A man is lying on the floor, looking up, helpless, with dead eyes.
A door opens and a woman peeks out. The female cop points her gun and the door slams. California, leading the group, steps up to apartment 303. He has a search warrant scotch-taped to the front of his bullet-proof vest.
CALIFORNIA
(to black cop)
This is it. Give it up.
The black cop hoists a heavy battering ram to California. The other cops get on both sides of the door. Somerset and Mills hang back a few feet, watching their backs.
BLACK COP
(points to Mills)
Cops go before Dicks.
Many people are sticking their heads out of doors in the hall.
