CALIFORNIA
Police! Open the door!!
California brings the ram forward with a splintering THUD -- once -- twice -- the door flies open. The cops storm in.
INT. SLUM APARTMENT, MAIN ROOM - MORNING
The apartment is incredibly dusty. The cops charge down the short hall into this room where a bed sits against the far wall.
California moves up to the bed. Someone lies under the sheets.
Three other cops move, all training their weapon on the bed.
CALIFORNIA
Good morning, sweetheart!
A blond cop goes into another room. California moves closer to the bed, gun up.
CALIFORNIA
Get up, now, motherfucker! NOW!
INT. SLUM APARTMENT, ADJOINING ROOM - MORNING
The blond cop enters, gun trained, looks around in confusion.
The room's tables, chairs and floor are covered with hundreds of colorful, plastic air fresheners.
INT. SLUM APARTMENT, MAIN ROOM - MORNING
Mills and Somerset enter. Somerset looks at the cops around the bed, then looks at a nearby wall. His mouth drops in horror. On the wall, written in excrement: SLOTH.
SOMERSET
Jesus... 
California kicks the bed, enraged.
CALIFORNIA
I said get up, Sleepyhead!
He pulls the sheets off the bed and reveals the shriveled, sore-covered form of a man who is blindfolded and tied to the bed with a thin wire which has been wrapped time and time again around the mattress and bed frame. Tubes runs out from a stained loincloth around the man's waist and snake under the bed.
CALIFORNIA
Fuck me!
Mills pushes past the other cops.
MILLS
Holy shit.
The cops recoil from the stench. Somerset steps up, putting his gun away.
SOMERSET
Victor?
BLACK COP
What the hell... ?
CALIFORNIA
(to Somerset)
Check this out, Dick... 
California points with his gun to the end of the man's right arm.
The hand is gone, severed at the wrist long ago.
MILLS
It is Victor.
SOMERSET
(points to a cop)
Call an ambulance.
The blond cop enters from the other room.
BLOND COP
What the fuck is this?
CALIFORNIA
Somebody call a hearse, more like.
The female cop has gone to one wall where a sheet is pinned up. She pulls the sheet down. Pinned behind the sheet are fifty-two Polaroid pictures; all pictures of Victor tied to the bed, with a date written at the bottom of each picture. It is a visual history of Victor's physical decay.
BLOND COP
What is going on?
Mills sees the female cop looking at the pictures.
MILLS
Hey, California, get your people
out.
Somerset takes out rubber gloves and puts them on.
CALIFORNIA
You heard him. Hit the hall, and
don't touch anything.
Somerset replaces the sheet over Victor, but not over his head.
The cops file out and Mills goes to examine the pictures.
California stays by the bed with Somerset.
CALIFORNIA
It looks like he's some kind of
friggin' sculpture or something.
Somerset places his finger along Victor's throat.
MILLS
Somerset, you...  you better look
here.
Mills looks at the photos in awe. Somerset joins him.
MILLS
All pictures of Victor tied to the
bed.
(crouches, points)
The last one is dated three days
ago.
Somerset looks at the first photo. In it, Victor is bound and gagged, but he is healthy.
SOMERSET
The first one...  it's dated one year
ago. To the day.
Somerset wipes his pale face.
Californian stands by the corpse, behind Somerset and Mills.
He lifts the sheet on the bed to look under it.
CALIFORNIA
Mother... 
Mills kneels and lifts the sheet which had covered the pictures off the floor. There is an open shoebox underneath.
MILLS
What... ?
On the side of the box: TO THE DETECTIVES, FROM ME.
California leans close to Victor's gaunt, blindfolded face, examining with morbid curiosity.
CALIFORNIA
You got what you deserved, Victor.
Somerset leans down beside Mills. Mills looks through the shoebox. Inside are plastic, zip-lock bags.
One contains small clumps of hair. One contains a yellow liquid... 
MILLS
(looking at bags)
A urine sample, hair sample...  stool
sample. Finger nails... 
(looks to Somerset)
He laughing at us.
California is still close to Victor's face, when suddenly Victor's lips twist open and Victor lets out a loud, guttural bark.
California jerks back, shouting in fear, falling over a chair to to the floor.
Mills and Somerset reel. They see California on the ground, scared out of his mind, pointing.
CALIFORNIA
He's alive!
Somerset and Mills look towards the bed.
Victor's lips move feebly as he lets out a sick, gurgling moan.
CALIFORNIA
He's still alive!!
EXT. SLUM APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING
A crowd has gathered at the entrance. Mills' car, the police van and two ambulances are parked on the sidewalk.
INT. SLUM HALLWAY - MORNING
The cops are in the hall holding neighbors at bay.
INT. SLUM APARTMENT, MAIN ROOM - MORNING
Three ambulance attendants are at the bed, working on Victor.
One attendant uses wire cutters to clip Victor's bonds.
INT. SLUM STAIRWELL - MORNING
Mills and Somerset are standing in the middle of one flight of stairs. Both are highly agitated.
SOMERSET
The way this has gone till now, I
wouldn't have thought it was possible,
but we may have underestimated this
guy.
MILLS
I want him bad. I don't just want to
catch him anymore. I want to hurt
him.
SOMERSET
Listen to me. He's all about playing
games.
MILLS
No kidding! No fucking kidding!
SOMERSET
We have to divorce ourselves from
emotions here. No matter how hard it
is, we have to stay focused on the
details.
MILLS
I don't know about you, but I feed
off my emotions.
SOMERSET
He'll string us along all the way if
we're not careful.
Mills is looking at the floor, still burning. Somerset grabs him by the jacket.
SOMERSET
Are you listening to me?
Mills pushes Somerset's hand off.
MILLS
I hear you.
There is a sudden, brilliant FLASH OF LIGHT and the SOUND of a CAMERA ADVANCING. Mills and Somerset look.
Down the stairs, a REPORTER has his camera up, pointed at them.
REPORTER
Say cheese.
He take another picture, flashbulb flashing.
Mills goes down the stairs, grabs the reporter, a balding, almost silly looking man with thick glasses and wrinkled clothing.
MILLS
What the fuck are you doing here?
The reporter squirms, holds up a laminated press pass on a cord around his neck.
REPORTER
I have a right, Officer. I... 
Mills shoves him, and the reporter stumbles a few steps, then falls to the landing below with a thud.
MILLS
That doesn't mean anything! This is
a closed crime scene!
Somerset comes to pull Mills back. The shaken reporter stands uneasily.
REPORTER
You can't do this! You can't... 
MILLS
Get the fuck out of here!
The reporter scrambles down the nest flight, out of sight.
REPORTER (O.S.)
The public has a right to know!
Somerset yanks Mills back harder, till Mills sits on the stairs.
MILLS
How do those cockroaches get here so
quick?
SOMERSET
They pay cops for the inside scoop,
and they pay well.
MILLS
(calming)
Sorry about that...  I just... 
SOMERSET
(sarcastic)
Oh, it's alright.
Somerset starts back up the stairs.
SOMERSET
It's always impressive to see a man
feeding off his emotions.
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
Somerset and Mills are with DOCTOR BEARDSLEY. Victor lies inside an oxygen tent with tubes running into him. The room is dim.
DOCTOR
A year of immobility seems about
right, judging by the deterioration
of the muscles and the spine. Blood
tests show a whole smorgasbord of
drugs in his systems; from crack to
heroin...  even an antibiotic which
must have been administered to keep
the bed sores from infecting.
Mills looks into the oxygen tent.
MILLS
He hasn't said anything, or tried to
express himself in any way?
DOCTOR
Even if his brain were not mush,
which it is...  he chewed off his own
tongue long ago.
Mills winces, moves away from the bed.
SOMERSET
There's no way he'll survive?
DOCTOR
Detective, he'd die right how of
shock if you were to shine a
flashlight in his eyes.
Silence for a moment, then the doctor lets out a chuckle.
DOCTOR
It's funny to think...  he's
experienced about as much pain and
suffering as anyone I've
encountered...  give or take...  and
he still has hell to look forward
to.
He chuckles again, engrossed in some information on a clipboard.
Mills looks to Somerset like, "this guy's nuts."
INT. PRECINCT HOUSE, SOMERSET'S OFFICE - DAY
A blackboard is nailed to the wall. Written in chalk:
1	gluttony (x)	5	wrath
2	greed (x)	6	pride
3	sloth (x)	7	lust
4	envy
Somerset and Mills are at their paperwork covered desks.
SOMERSET
(reading one sheet)
Victor's landlord says an envelope
of cash was in the office mailbox
each month. He says, quote, "I never
heard a single complaint from the
tenant in apartment three-o-one, and
nobody ever complained about him.
He's the best tenant I've ever had.
MILLS
A landlord's dream tenant: a paralyzed
man with no tongue.
SOMERSET
Who pays the rent on time.
Somerset turns to the typewriter, types. Mills fills out a form by hand. He make an error and tries to erase, but the paper rips. He curses, crumples the paper and throws it.
MILLS
I'm sick of sitting around, waiting
for him to kill again.
SOMERSET
This is the job. It's not an Easter
egg hunt.
MILLS
There must be something in this pile
of garbage we can follow. I mean,
Christ...  do we have to let this
lunatic make all the moves.
SOMERSET
It's too dismissive to call him a
lunatic. We can't make that mistake.
MILLS
Oh, blah, blah, blah. The guy's
insane.
SOMERSET
It's a fine line between insane and
inspired.
MILLS
Hey, Freud, what brand of bullshit
are you shoveling, huh? Right now
he's probably dancing around his
room in a pair of his mommy's panties,
singing show tunes and rubbing himself
with peanut butter... 
SOMERSET
No.
MILLS
Sooner or later his luck's going to
run out.
SOMERSET
No. He's not depending on luck. You've
seen that. We walked into that
apartment exactly one year after he
first tied Victor to the bed, to the
day. To the day! Because he wanted
us to.
MILLS
We don't know for sure... 
SOMERSET
Yes we do. Here... 
Somerset picks up the photocopy of the first note.
SOMERSET
This quote...  his first words to us.
I looked it up. It's from Milton's
Paradise Lost. "Long is the way, and
hard, that out of hell leads up to
light...  "
MILLS
And so what?
SOMERSET
Well, he's been right so far, hasn't
he?
MILLS
Just because the bastard has a library
card, it doesn't make him Einstein.
SOMERSET
Just, realize...  this is not some
common lunatic. The type of intestinal
fortitude it must take...  to keep a
man bound for a full year. To connect
tubes to his genitals. To sever his
hand and use it to plant fingerprints.
He's methodical and exacting, and
worst of all, he's patient.
MILLS
What does all that matter anyway?
It's not our job to figure him out,
is it? All we have to do is catching
him.
Something clicks for Somerset. He looks away, thinking.
Mills watches him.
MILLS
What?
Somerset sits. Ponders, staring off into space.
MILLS
What is it?
Somerset stands back up, takes money out of his pockets.
SOMERSET
How much money do you have?
MILLS
I don't know...  like fifty.
Somerset picks up the phone and dials, still sifting through his own money. Mills doesn't know what's going on.
SOMERSET
(to Mills)
I propose a field trip.
INT. PUBLIC LIBRARY - DAY
Somerset walks through the busy main library, goes to a group of computer terminals. Mills follows, wound up. Somerset sits at one computer and works the keyboard, hunt-and-peck.
MILLS
Somerset...  what the fuck?
Several people turn to shush him. Somerset takes out a notepad.
SOMERSET
At the top of the list, we'll put
Purgatory, Canterbury Tales... 
anything relating to the seven deadly
sins. Now, what the killer might
research. What would he need to study
to do the things he's done? What are
his other interests? For example... 
INSERT -- COMPUTER SCREEN
Somerset types. On the screen:
SEARCH: JACK THE RIPPER.
EXT. HOT DOG WORLD - DAY
The restaurant's sign reads: HOT DOG WORLD, HOME OF THE WORLD'S BIGGEST DOGS. A MAN is trying to give out paper advertisements.
People walk out of their way to avoid him.
MAN
(to people)
Take one, you stupid fucks! Here... 
take one! It's a fucking coupon!
Take it!
INT. HOT DOG WORLD - DAY
Mills and Somerset are in a booth, both on the same seat on the same side of the table. They look over their list of books.
Mills goes to eat a hot dog, but Somerset stops him.
SOMERSET
They had about fifty health violations
during the last inspection.
Mills throws the dog down, looks at his watch.
MILLS
Could you at least sit across from
me? I don't want people to thing
we're dating.
Somerset watches a GREASY MAN, wearing a black suit, enter.
The man's hair is slicked back.
SOMERSET
Give me your money.
Mills hands his money to Somerset.
MILLS
I'm handing you this, and for some
strange reason, I have the idea I
should know what the fuck we're doing.
Somerset folds the money with his own into the list of books. He holds the list in his lap, under the table. Greasy Man comes to sit at the table.
GREASY MAN
Hey, Somerset. How are you? I didn't
know this was going to be a menage-a-
trois.
SOMERSET
It's not a problem.
GREASY MAN
Only for you do I do this. Big risk
here...  so I figure we'll be even-
up. All fair and square.
Greasy Man has his hands under the table. He gets up to leave with his hand in his pocket. He picks up Mills' dog.
GREASY MAN
About an hour.
Greasy Man leaves, eating the hot dog.
MILLS
Well, that was money well spent.
SOMERSET
Let's go.
INT. PIZZA PARLOR - DAY
Mills and Somerset sit with a pizza before them.
SOMERSET
By telling you this, I'm trusting
you more than I trust most people.
MILLS
It be best if you got to the point,
cause I'm about ready to punch you
in the face.
Somerset leans closer to Mills, speaks quietly.
SOMERSET
It's probably nothing, but even if
it is, it's no skin off our teeth.
The man at Hot Dog World is a friend,
in the Bureau.
MILLS
Him?
SOMERSET
For a long time, the F.B.I.'s been
hooked into the library system,
keeping accuate records.
MILLS
What? Assessing fines?
SOMERSET
They monitor reading habits. Not
every book, but certain ones are
flagged. Books about...  let's say,
how to build a nuclear bomb, or maybe
Mein Kampf. Whoever takes out a
flagged book has their library records
fed to the F.B.I. from then on.
MILLS
You got to be kidding.
SOMERSET
Flagged books cover every topic the
Bureau deems questionable...  communism
to violent crime.
MILLS
How is this legal?
SOMERSET
Legal...  illegal. These terms don't
apply. I don't applaud it.
Somerset takes a bite of pizza.
SOMERSET
They can't use the information
directly, but it's a useful guide.
It might sound silly, but you can't
get a library card without i.d. and
a current phone bill.
Mills is starting to warm to it.
MILLS
So they ran our list.
SOMERSET
If you want to know who's been reading
Paradise Lost, Purgatory, and say... 
The Life and Time of Charlie Manson,
the Bureau's computer will tell you.
It might give us a name.
MILLS
Yeah. Some college student who's
taking English 101 and just happens
to be writing a paper on Twentieth
Century Crime.
SOMERSET
Yeah, well...  at least we're out of
the office. We've got pizza.
MILLS
How do you know all about this?
SOMERSET
I don't. Neither do you.
Somerset looks up. Greasy Man is entering the pizza parlor.
INT. SOMERSET'S CAR - DAY
The car is parked with Somerset at the wheel and Mills beside.
They're looking through pages of connected computer paper.
MILLS
This is a waste of time.
SOMERSET
We're focusing.
MILLS
I know, I know...  focusing on one
little thing.
SOMERSET
(reading aloud)
The Divine Comedy. A History of
Catholicism. A book called Murderers
and Madmen.
He hands the sheets to Mills. Mills looks them over.
MILLS
(reading)
Modern Homicide Investigation. In
Cold Blood. Of Human Bondage. Human
Bondage?
SOMERSET
It's not what you think it is.
MILLS
(reads)
The Marquis de Sade and Origins of
Sadism.
SOMERSET
That is.
MILLS
(reads)
The Writings of Saint Thomas Aqu... 
Aquin... 
SOMERSET
Saint Thomas Aquinas.
(starts the car)
He wrote about the seven deadly sins.
INT. TENEMENT BUILDING, STAIRWELL/HALLWAY -- DAY
Somerset and Mills walk up the stairs and turn a corner into this long hall. Somerset is looking at the computer sheets.
MILLS
You're sure you're reading that right?
John Doe?
SOMERSET
That's what it says. Jonathan Doe.
MILLS
This is stupid. It'd be just too
easy.
SOMERSET
We'll take a look at him. Talk to
him.
MILLS
Sure. Uh, excuse me...  are you by
any chance a serial killer? Oh, you
are? Well, come with us then, if
it's okay.
They reach a door, apartment 6A. Somerset knocks.
MILLS
What are you going to say?
SOMERSET
You do the talking. Put that old
silver tongue of yours to work.
MILLS
Who told you about my silver tongue?
You been talking to my wife?
Mills knocks on the door, hard.
MILLS
This is really lame.
A CREAK is HEARD O.S. Somerset turns to look towards it... 
A male figure, JOHN DOE, is standing at the stairwell, wearing a hat and standing in shadow, looking towards them. Stark still.
Somerset furrows his brow.
The John Doe reaches into his coat, lifts his arm, pointing... 
SOMERSET
Mills... !
BLAM -- GUNFIRE SOUNDS, deafening, as a bullet slams into door 6A, just missing Somerset as he and Mills hit the floor.
John Doe fires again... 
The bullet blows a huge hole in the wall, throwing plaster. A third bullet follows, just above Mills and Somerset, and John Doe is heard running back down the stairs.
The gunfire's still echoing, ringing, as Mills gets up and unholsters his gun.
MILLS
Jesus Christ... 
Mills scrambles down the stairwell... 
IN THE STARWELL
Mills bounds down stairs, turns a corner and leaps down another flight. He halts on the landing, listening. John Doe can be HEARD still RUNNING, below.
IN THE HALL ABOVE
Somerset rolls and takes out his gun. He stands, dazed.
MILLS (O.S.)
(from in stairwell)
What kind of gun was it?
IN THE STAIRWELL
Somerset comes into the stairwell.
MILLS (O.S.)
(from below)
Damn it, Somerset...  what kind of
gun?! How many bullets?
BELOW, IN THE STAIRWELL
Mills hurries down more stairs.
SOMERSET (O.S.)
(from above)
I don't know. Might've been a
revolver.
Voices echo. Mills loses his footing, falls... 
Mills hits the next landing hard, dropping his gun.
MILLS
Fuck!
Mills gets back up and picks up his gun and keeps going.
ABOVE IN THE STAIRWELL
the stairs, breathing hard.
MILLS (O.S.)
(from below)
What's he look like?
SOMERSET
Brown hat. Tan raincoat...  like a... 
like a trench coat.
BELOW IN THE STAIRWELL
ready, moves to peer over the railing, down into stairwell's center...  in shadow, aiming his gun straight up...  a SHOT is FIRED from below and the bullet is
ABOVE
Somerset splinters into a million pieces, sends Somerset ducking for cover.
Far below -- the bullet is HEARD RICOCHETING
BELOW
waiting as the gunshot echoes.
MILLS
(to himself)
Five...  that's five... 
Continues down the stairs... 
INT. TENEMENT BUILDING, LOWER HALLWAY - DAY
And into a hallway, falling to one knee, his gun one direction -- empty hallway. Other direction, gun hand shaking, catches a glimpse of John Doe just as he disappears around a corner.
Mills gets up, looking back to the number 2, shouting back towards the stairwell... 
MILLS
Second floor! Second floor!
FOLLOW him, tearing ass...  run, full speed ahead, bringing his gun up... 
John Doe's running... 
Mills takes aim... 
Ahead, between John Doe and Mills, a tenant in t-shirt and underwear comes out an apartment, looking towards John Doe, blocking the line of fire... 
MILLS
Get down! Move... !
The tenant turns to Mills, confused. Mills pushes angrily past... 
Ahead, John Doe makes an abrupt halt. A woman tenant is looking out her door and John Doe grabs her and throws her into the hall.
She falls as John Doe shoves his way into her apartment.
BACK AT THE STAIRWELL
Somerset comes down the stairs, tired. He runs.
AROUND THE CORNER, IN THE OTHER HALLWAY SECTION
Mills reaches the apartment Doe entered, bursting in... 
INT. TENEMENT APARTMENT - DAY
Mills enters, gun up. It's a railroad apartment, with all
the rooms adjoining in a row. At the far end of the apartment, John Doe can be seen moving out one room's window onto a fire escape just as that room's door is swinging shut.
Mills charges through the apartment, full on... 
He bashes through the closed door... 
EXT. TENEMENT BUILDING, FIRE ESCAPE - DAY
Mills leans out the window over an alleyway. BLAM -- GUNSHOT.
The window above Mills' shatters and Mills pulls back.
Mills leans back out, fanning with his gun, searching.
Below, John Doe runs out the alleyway's mouth and rounds a corner, gone.
Mills curses, scrambling out onto the fire escape, running a few steps and then vaulting the rail...  crashes down on the roof of a car parked below. The windshield cracks. Mills jumps off and continues the pursuit... 
MILLS
(to himself)
That's six... 
EXT. CITY STREET - DAY
Mills rounds the alleyway corner into people packed streets.
Several people are running, heading several different directions.
Mills comes to a halt, his focus confused, searching desperately. Others run upon seeing his gun. Woman scream and grab up their children. Mills can't see far down the sidewalk because of all the people. He moves forward... 
He jumps atop a fire hydrant, gripping a street sign for balance, trying to see further down the street.
MILLS' P.O.V. -- There he is! John Doe can be seen, far off, moving across the street, through traffic, to the opposite sidewalk.
ON THE STREET, Mills runs, into traffic, avoiding cars, down the center line. Angry drivers scream at him.
Ahead, John Doe glances back, ducking into an alley.
Mills gets to the other sidewalk, yelling for people to get out of the way... 
EXT. CITY ALLEYWAY - DAY
Mills comes to this tight alleyway. It's dark, with a long, tall, vertical sliver of daylight far ahead. Mills runs... 
Charging hard onwards... 
A two-by-four swings out from a hidden nook along the side
of the alleyway -- slamming Mills in the face with a THWACK!!
Mills' gun hits the alley wall and clatters into a puddle.
Mills hits the dirt, on his back, nose broken and split, face bloodied. He cries out, rolling to his side, clutching his face.
The two-by-four is dropped. John Doe's feet cross a short distance. Doe's hand reaches to pick up Mills' gun. (We never see John Doe's face.)
Mills still lies on his side, stunned, spitting blood and cursing, when he feels the barrel of his gun against the side of his face. Mills freezes.
John Doe moves the gun slowly across Mills' face, till the barrel reaches Mills' mouth. The barrel is inserted between his lips.
The gun's hammer is pulled back.
Mills quakes, tries to open his eyes, but he's blinded by the blood from his broken nose. For an instant, there is a sudden, BRIGHT FLASH of LIGHT.
After a long moment, the gun withdrawals. From O.S., the bullets fall out of Mills gun onto his chest.
The gun is dropped. John Doe runs towards the sliver of light.
He's gone.
Mills lies for a long moment, gasping. At the alleyway's entrance, Somerset appears.
SOMERSET
Mills... 
Mills rolls, shaken, feeling to pick up the bullets and trying to rub the blood out of his eyes with his shirt sleeve. Somerset arrives.
SOMERSET
Are you alright?
MILLS
I'm fine.
SOMERSET
What happened?
Mills gets up, collects his gun and pockets it, then walks past Somerset, heading back.
SOMERSET
Mills...  ?
Mills starts running. Somerset runs to follow.
INT. TENEMENT BUILDING, STAIRWELL/HALLWAY - DAY
Mills moves from the stairwell, driven, his nose still bleeding, heading for apartment 6A. Somerset takes Mills arm, but Mills pulls away and keeps going.
SOMERSET
Wait...  just wait.
MILLS
It was him.
SOMERSET
You can't go in there.
Somerset grabs Mills again and Mills shoves him off.
MILLS
The hell I can't! We get in there
and we can stop him.
SOMERSET
We need a warrant.
MILLS
We have probable cause now.
Somerset grabs Mills and shoves him against the wall.
SOMERSET
Think about it... 
MILLS
What the fuck is wrong with you?
SOMERSET
Think about how we got here!
Somerset holds the computer paper, now crumpled in his hand.
He waves it in Mills' face as Mills struggles.
SOMERSET
We can't tell anyone about this. We
can't tell them about the Bureau, so
we have no reason for being here.
Mills stops struggling, breathing hard, seething, trembling.
MILLS
By the time we clear a warrant someone
else is going to be dead.
SOMERSET
Think it through. If we leave a hole
like this, we'll never prosecute.
He'll walk.
(pause)
We have to come up with some excuse
for knocking on this door.
MILLS
Okay...  okay...  get off.
Somerset releases Mills. Mills looks around the hall, then goes right to door 6A and KICKS IT IN -- the door jam splinters and the door swings open to darkness for a moment before swinging back, half-shut.
SOMERSET
You stupid son of a... 
MILLS
No point in arguing anymore... 
Mills strides down the short end of the hall, towards a window.
MILLS
(pointing back)
Unless you can fix that.
Mills stops, looking out the window. It overlooks a weedy, overgrown courtyard where a THIN VAGRANT lies asleep on the concrete. Mills turns, looking back to Somerset.
MILLS
How much money do we have left?
INT. TENEMENT BUILDING, STAIRWELL - EARLY EVENING
On a stairwell landing, Somerset watches the thin vagrant from the courtyard talk to a uniformed POLICEMAN who writes on a clipboard, taking the statement.
THIN VAGRANT
So, I...  I noticed this guy going
out...  going out a lot when those
murders were happening. So...  so
I... 
The vagrant's clinging to the rail, drunk and out of it. Mills is down further on the stairs, high strung, chomping at the bit to get this over with.
MILLS
So, you called Detective Somerset,
right?
THIN VAGRANT
Yeah, I...  I called the detective.
Because, because this guy seemed... 
creepy. And...  and... 
MILLS
(urging him on)
And... 
THIN VAGRANT
And, one of the murders was over
there...  over...  nearby here. I...  I
called the cops... 
The vagrant wipes drool from his lips. Mills comes to grip him so he doesn't fall, searching the policemen's face for suspicion.
MILLS
I told you the rest. You got it?
POLICEMAN
(still writing)
Yeah, whatever.
SOMERSET
Have him sign it.
The policeman holds the clipboard and pen out to the vagrant.
Mills takes the pen and guides the vagrant's hand, almost signing it for him.
MILLS
Great. Is that it?
The policeman nods. Mills grips the vagrant and leads him down the stairs in a hurry, around a bend. Mills looks up to be sure they're out of the policeman's sight, takes out a wad of cash and shoves it in the vagrant's pocket.
MILLS
Go drink yourself happy.
Mills quickly guides the vagrant on his way, then turns and rushes up the stairs, taking them two at a time.
INT. JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT, MAIN ROOM - EARLY EVENING
Mills pushes door 6A open, putting on rubber gloves. He steps in with Somerset behind. Somerset turns back to the policeman.
SOMERSET
(to policeman)
Wait outside.
Somerset closes the door most of the way. Mills hits a switch on the wall and a lamp illuminates a desk. The desk is in the center of the room, facing them. The room is bizarre, with some areas cluttered and others barren. All the walls are painted black. All the large, curtainless windows are painted over.
Somerset puts on his gloves. Mills walks to the desk.
The desktop is rather tidy. The only blatantly strange thing is a set of notches carved into the wooden surface: three notches. A candle has been allowed to burn down at one corner of the desk and the wax trail goes all the way to the floor. Mills opens the middle desk drawer. It's empty except for The Holy Bible.
Somerset moves along shelves of books, looking at the spines.
Lots of thick, oversized art volumes. A HISTORY OF THEOLOGY.
HANDBOOK OF FIREARMS. HISTORY OF THE WORLD. SUMMA THEOLOGICA.
UNITED STATES CRIMINAL LAW REVIEW.
At the desk, Mills opens another drawer. It's filled with at least forty empty aspirin bottles. He opens the next drawer and finds a rosary and several boxes of bullets.
Somerset comes to look at John Doe's "bed." No mattress.
It's only a metal frame and springs with a sheet spread across it. The sheet is sweat stained and dotted by stains of rust
at many points where springs have worn through.
Somerset walks around the bed to a narrow table not far away against the wall. The table contains a strange tableau, like
a	mini stage, hand-made of cardboard and pasted Communion wafers. A human hand immersed in a jar of liquid is the centerpiece.
SOMERSET
(quiet, to himself)
Victor.
Above this, on the wall, there's a clutter of pinned up articles about the seven deadly sins, pages from art books, pencil drawings of Christ, all tight together and overlapping.
Mills picks up a small piece of paper from a letter holder.
It's a pink receipt from WILD BILL'S LEATHER SHOP.
Written: CUSTOM JOB. $502.64. PAID IN FULL. Mills puts the receipt back down on the desk.
Somerset walks to a black door. Opens it.
INT. JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT, ROOM TWO - EARLY EVENING
Somerset enters. A ceiling light is on. Bare bulb. There are bookshelves on three walls, filled with notebooks. Thousands and thousands of notebooks.
Somerset takes one notebook down. It is a thick composition book with an unlabeled cover. Inside, the pages are filled with small handwritten sentences, thumb-nail sketches and blurry, glued in photographs; small photos, seemingly cut from contact sheets. The sketches, pictures and writings takes up ever single inch.
Somerset takes down another notebook and flips through the pages. Same as the first, filled to the brim.
Somerset crosses to another shelf and pulls another notebook.
Same deal. Somerset looks around.
SOMERSET
Jesus.
INT. JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT, MAIN ROOM - EARLY EVENING
Mills moves from the desk to a hall. He tries a light switch, but it does nothing. He walks... 
It's dark. A rather long hall. The only light is a red glow seeping from under the bottom of the closed door ahead.
INT. JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT, ROOM TWO - EARLY EVENING
Somerset walks to a 16mm film projector. It sits facing a battered white screen. Somerset turns the projector on, backing away to switch off the bare bulb above.
INT. JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT, HALL - EARLY EVENING
Mills reaches the door at the end of the hall. He turns the knob and pushes the door open. He's bathed in red light.
INT. JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT, BATHROOM - EARLY EVENING
Mills enters. He looks around, slowly. Stunned.
INT. JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT, ROOM TWO - EARLY EVENING
The projector is clattering in the dark, running a piece of film through. The film is spliced to run as a non-stop loop.
Somerset watches the screen, light strobing across him.
The screen shows a bright image of clouds drifting, with strange superimposed angels in flowing robes floating jerkily. It's like a weird, old Hollywood version of Heaven.
The images switch abruptly to fire and tormented souls laboring around a pit of molten goo, where more tormented humans squirm. Like Heaven, it's a scratched piece of film from Hollywood's early days.
MILLS (O.S.)
Somerset!
Somerset is engrossed in the images.
MILLS (O.S.)
Somerset...  come here!
Somerset hears him.
INT. JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT, HALL/BATHROOM - EARLY EVENING
Somerset comes down the hall.
MILLS (O.S.)
We had him, damn it.
Somerset reaches the bathroom where Mills stands looking up at the wall. The room has been converted into a dark room lit by red bulbs, with strips of film hanging from the ceiling.
SOMERSET
What are you talking about?
MILLS
We had him.
There are hundreds of prints on the walls and hanging from drying wires. Somerset looks around, trying to understand... 
Pictures of John Doe's victims, alive and dead. Grotesque photos, of their pleading faces, and their dead bodies. Close
shots of eyes, fingers and mouths.
Mills sits on the closed toilet, throwing something into the nearby sink and resting his head in his hands.
MILLS
The pass was a fake.
In the sink -- it's a laminated press pass on a neck cord.
On the walls, more pictures: of the crime scenes, but from the outside looking in. Long shots. Police cars. Ambulances.
Uniformed officers putting up police barrier ribbons outside buildings. The coroner's wagon.
Somerset stares at them, taking them in, realizing... 
MILLS
We had him and we let him go.
In the backgrounds of the pictures: Somerset and Mills. In another: Mills crossing the street. In another: Somerset and Mills getting out of Somerset's car.
One photo, close shot, shows Mills and Somerset on the stairwell of the building where Victor's body was found. It is the picture taken by the balding, almost silly looking reporter.
INT. JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT, MAIN ROOM -- NIGHT
A male forensic uses tongs to remove Victor's hand from the jar of liquid. He places the hand in a clear plastic evidence bag.
The forensic walks away with the hand, past a FEMALE SKETCH ARTIST who puts the finishing touches on an accurate drawing of the balding, almost silly looking reporter who wears thick glasses, now known as John Doe.
SKETCH ARTIST
You're sure this is him?
Mills stands over the sketch artist. Two deputy detectives, SARA and BILLY, are at work along with two other forensics searching, photographing and dusting.
MILLS
Just put it in circulation.
SKETCH ARTIST
You got it. Tomorrow morning, this
city's good citizens will be on the
lookout for Elmer Fudd.
SARA
(coming to Mills)
We can't find anything to hang on
to. No paystubs, no appointment books
or calendars. Not even an address
book. And, you're not going to believe
this... 
MILLS
Keep looking.
SARA
It's just...  we haven't found any
fingerprints yet. Not a single one.
MILLS
You know, you're right, I don't
believe you. Keep looking.
Mills walks away.
INT. JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT, ROOM TWO - NIGHT
Somerset and three uniformed officers are looking through
the notebooks on the shelves. Somerset squints at the notebook in his hand, shaking his head as he reads. Mills enters.
Somerset looks up and closes the notebook.
SOMERSET
We could use about fifty more men
here.
MILLS
I'm trying, alright? Just tell me
what we've got.
Somerset pauses briefly at Mills' abruptness.
SOMERSET
Well, there are at least five thousand
notebooks in this room, and near as
I can tell, each notebook contains
two hundred and fifty pages.
MILLS
Then, he must write about these
murders.
SOMERSET
(opens notebook, reads)
"What sick, ridiculous, puppets we
are, and what a gross, little stage
we dance on. What fun we have, dancing
and fucking, not a care in the world.
Not knowing that we are nothing. We
are not what was intended."
Somerset turns a few pages.
SOMERSET
(reads)
"On the subway today, a man came to
me to start a conversation. He made
small talk, this lonely man, talking
about the weather and other things.
I tried to be pleasant and
accommodating, but my head began to
hurt from his banality. I almost
didn't notice it had happened, but I
suddenly threw up all over him. He
was not pleased, and I couldn't help
laughing."
