Somerset closes the notebook.
SOMERSET
No dates indicated, placed on the
shelves in no discernible order.
It's just his mind poured out on
paper. I don't think it's going to
give us any specifics.
MILLS
Looking around...  I've got a bad
feeling these murders are his life's
work.
A PHONE is HEARD RINGING in another room. Mills looks.
INT. JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT, MAIN ROOM - NIGHT
Everyone's looking around, and at each other, trying to find the source of the RINGING. Mills and Somerset enter, baffled. Mills looks to Sara. She shrugs and shakes her head.
Everyone searches. PHONE RINGS.
Mills gets on his hands and knees.
MILLS
Here... 
Mills crawls under John Doe's "bed." He comes back out with
a rotary phone. Someone throws him a micro-cassette recorder.
Mills turns the recorder on, makes sure it's running, then picks up the phone with the recorder to the earpiece.
MILLS
(into phone)
Hello.
JOHN DOE (V.O.)
(from phone)
I admire you. I don't know how you
found me, but imagine my surprise. I
respect you detectives more every
day.
MILLS
(into phone)
Okay, John, let's... 
JOHN DOE (V.O.)
(from phone)
No, no, no! You listen. I'll be back
on schedule tomorrow, even with this
setback. I just had to call and
express my admiration. I'm sorry I
had to hurt you today, but I didn't
have a choice. You will accept my
apology, won't you?
Mills says nothing, containing his anger.
JOHN DOE (V.O.)
I feel like saying more...  but I
don't want to ruin the surprise.
John Doe hangs up. Mills puts down the phone.
INT. JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT, ROOM TWO - LATER NIGHT
Mills and Somerset stand in the dark, watching the continuous loop projector's strange images of Heaven and Hell.
MILLS
You were right.
Somerset looks at Mills.
MILLS
He's preaching.
SOMERSET
(nods)
These murders are his masterwork.
His sermon to all of us. To all us
sinners.
The door opens and light bursts in. The captain stands there, looking them over.
CAPTAIN
It's been a long day, kids. Go home.
Just make sure you sleep with the
phone between your legs.
INT. SOMERSET'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM -- NIGHT
Somerset winds his metronome. PHONE RINGS. Somerset does not want to answer it, but does.
SOMERSET
(into phone)
Hello.
TRACY (V.O.)
(from phone)
Hello, William? It's Tracy.
SOMERSET
(into phone)
Tracy, is everything alright?
TRACY (V.O.)
Yes, yes, everything's fine.
SOMERSET
Where's David?
TRACY (V.O.)
He's in the shower, in the other
room. I'm sorry to call like this.
SOMERSET
It's alright, I guess.
TRACY (V.O.)
I, um...  I need to talk to you. I
need to talk to someone. Can you
meet me somewhere...  maybe tomorrow
morning?
SOMERSET
I really don't understand.
TRACY (V.O.)
I feel stupid, but you're the only
person I know here. There's no one
else... 
SOMERSET
I just... 
TRACY (V.O.)
Can't you get away, for a little
while?
SOMERSET
I don't know, with this case.
TRACY
If you can, please call me. Please.
I have to go now...  goodnight.
Tracy hangs up. Somerset looks at the phone, wondering.
INSERT -- TITLE CARD
FRIDAY
INT. COFFEE CAFE - MORNING
Somerset sits in the window booth with Tracy. The cafe is noisy.
Tracy stares into her coffee while she stirs it.
TRACY
I mean, you known this city. You've
been here for so long.
SOMERSET
It's a hard place.
TRACY
I don't sleep very well.
Somerset is trying to be understanding, but sneaks a look at his watch.
SOMERSET
I feel strange being here with you... 
without David knowing.
TRACY
I'm sorry, I only... 
Two young punks step up to the window outside and look in at Tracy. One flicks his tongue rapidly. Tracy looks away.
Somerset takes out his badge and holds it against the window.
One punk gives the finger and the other spits on the window.
They leave, laughing. Tracy tries to smile.
TRACY
Perfect example.
SOMERSET
You have to put blinders on sometimes.
Most times.
TRACY
I don't know why I asked you to come.
SOMERSET
Talk to him about it. He'll understand
if you tell him how you feel.
TRACY
I can't be a burden, especially now.
I know I'll get used to things. I
guess I wanted to know what someone
who's lived here thinks. Upstate, it
was a completely different
environment.
(pause)
I don't know if David told you, but
I teach fifth grade, or did.
SOMERSET
He mentioned it.
Tracy seems very upset, near tears.
TRACY
I've been going to some of the
schools, looking for work, but the
conditions here are...  horrible.
SOMERSET
You should look into private schools.
TRACY
I don't know... 
Tracy looks up, wipes at her eyes.
SOMERSET
What's really bothering you?
Tracy bites her lip.
TRACY
David and I are...  going to have a
baby.
Somerset sits back, the expression of soothing concern on his face disappearing.
SOMERSET
Oh, Tracy...  I have to tell you, I'm
not the one to talk to about this.
TRACY
I hate this city.
Somerset sighs. He takes out a cigarette, but thinks better of it and puts it back. He looks out the window.
SOMERSET
If you're thinking... 
(pause)
I had a relationship once, very much
like a marriage. And, she was going
to have our child.	This is a long
time ago. She and I had decided we
were going to make the choice
together...  whether to keep the baby.
Tracy looks at Somerset.
SOMERSET
Well, I got up one morning and went
to work...  just like any other day,
except it was my first since hearing
about the baby. And, I...  I felt
this fear and anxiety washing over
me. I looked around, and I thought,
how can we raise a child surrounded
by all this? How can a child grow up
here?
(pause)
So, that night, I told her I didn't
want us to have it, and over the
next few weeks, I convinced her it
was wrong. I mean...  I wore her down,
slowly.
TRACY
I want to have children. It's just... 
SOMERSET
I can tell you now, I know...  I'm
positive I made the right decision.
I'm positive. But, there's never a
day that passes that I don't wish I
had decided differently.
Somerset reaches and takes Tracy's hand.
SOMERSET
If you...  don't keep the baby, if
that's what you decide, then, never
tell him you were pregnant. I mean
that. Never.
(pause)
The relationship will whither and
die.
Tracy nods, tears welling up again. Somerset smiles a bit.
SOMERSET
But, if you do decide to have the
baby, then, at that very moment,
when you're absolutely sure, tell
David. Tell him at that exact second,
and then spoil that kid every chance
you get.
There are tears in Somerset's eyes.
SOMERSET
That's all the advice I can give
you, Tracy. I don't even know you.
He smiles again, wipes his own tears.
TRACY
William... 
Somerset's beeper begins BEEPING. He takes it out and stands, wanting to leave. Tracy gets up and kisses him on the cheek.
TRACY
Thank you.
Somerset starts to back away.
TRACY
Keep in touch after you're gone,
William. Please.
Somerset nods, raises a hand to say goodbye as he leaves.
INT. WILD BILL'S LEATHER SHOP - DAY
Mills and Somerset are on one side of the counter and WILD BILL is on the other. Wild Bill is shirtless and covered in tattoos.
He has a thick scar running down the center of his forehead and down his cheek. Leather belts, whips and jackets hang on the walls and from the ceiling.
WILD BILL
Yeah, he picked it up last night.
Wild Bill holds the pink receipt from John Doe's apartment.
MILLS
This was definitely him?
Mills points to the rendering of John Doe he holds.
WILD BILL
Yeah, John Doe.	Easy name to
remember.
SOMERSET
What was this job you did for him?
WILD BILL
I got a picture of it here. It's a
real sweet piece... 
Wild Bill pulls a box from behind the counter, digs in it.
WILD BILL
I figured he must be one of those
performance artists. That's what I
figured. Like one of those guys who
pisses in a cup on stage and drinks
it. Performance art.
Wild Bill hands a Polaroid picture to Mills. We do not see the picture yet.
MILLS
Oh...  give me a break.
WILD BILL
I think I undercharged him.
SOMERSET
(looks at photo)
You built this for him? You build
this?
WILD BILL
I've built weirder shit than that.
So what?
A POLICEMAN enters the store.
POLICEMAN
Detectives...  we have a situation.
Mills and Somerset follow the cop out.
WILD BILL
Hey, my picture... !
Wild Bill watches them go, scratches his thick scar.
WILD BILL
Fucking pigs.
EXT. THE HOT HOUSE MASSAGE PARLOUR - DAY
It's a madhouse outside The Hot House, a bright red storefront bordered on both sides by porno theater after porno theater. A crowd is gathered around a police action in progress.
Cops have formed a barrier, holding back the crowd and creating an aisle from the entrance of The Hot House to the back of a jail-van. Cops and detectives are escorting various men, women and transvestites into the large vehicle. The crowd, consisting of the dregs of society, is shouting. Some people are spitting and throwing trash at the cops.
INT. THE HOT HOUSE, RECEPTION AREA - DAY
TWO COPS are in front of a glass and steel cage. Inside the cage is a fat, BALD MAN with a wall of sex toys behind him.
BALD MAN
Just wait! Just wait!
One cop pounds his nightstick against the glass.
COP
Get out of the fucking booth!
BALD MAN
Just wait! I'll come out, just wait!
INT. THE HOT HOUSE, CORRIDORS - DAY
All the lights are red and the walls are painted red. Mills and Somerset follow a THIRD COP through the twisting corridors.
POLICEMEN can be HEARD SHOUTING and MAKING ARRESTS. ROCK MUSIC PLAYS, throbbing. They come to a door.
THIRD COP
I don't want to go in there again.
INT. RED ROOM - DAY
Mills and Somerset enter. ROCK MUSIC CONTINUES, LOUD. A strobe light flashes from the ceiling. TWO AMBULANCE ATTENDANTS are in the room. The first attendant is placing a sheet over a bed, hiding the corpse of a blonde woman. The second attendant is trying to examine the pupils of a CRAZED MAN, 55, who is naked and wrapped in a sheet. A SWEATING COP holds crazed man down.
CRAZED MAN
He...  he...  he made me do it!
SECOND ATTENDANT
I have to look at you. I have to
look at you!
LUST is scratched into the red paint on the wall in big letters.
Mills and Somerset move towards the covered body.
FIRST ATTENDANT
(to Mills and Somerset)
You're not going to want to see this
more than once.
CRAZED MAN
He had a gun! He made me do it!
The sheet is lifted for the detectives. They grimace at what they see. We do not see. Somerset closes his eyes and turns away. The first attendant replaces the sheet.
Mills steps back, takes out his handkerchief and sucks on it. He looks at the crazed man. The crazed man jerks around while the second attendant preps a needle.
SECOND ATTENDANT
He's in shock, man. He's gone.
CRAZED MAN
Take this thing off me...  take it
off! Please, take this thing off me!
The sweating cop keeps his controlling grip on the crazed man.
CRAZED MAN
Get it off...  oh, God!
SWEATING COP
(to Mills and Somerset)
You're the detectives, right? Right?
Well, you'd better see this!
Somerset's facing the wall. Crazed man's still yelling.
SWEATING COP
Hey...  you better see what's strapped
onto this guy!
Mills turns to the cop.
MILLS
We've already seen it!
INT. SANATORIUM, WHITE ROOM - DAY
A Polaroid photograph on a white table. It is the photo Wild Bill gave to Mills. It's a picture of a belt, made with extra leather straps so it can be worn securely around the groin.
It is a strap-on phallus, except there is no plastic protuberance.
Instead, there is a metal knife -- it's a strap-on butcher's knife.
CRAZED MAN
And...  and...  and he said...  he asked
me if I was married. And, I could
see he had a gun in his hand.
SOMERSET
Where was the girl?
CRAZED MAN
What? What?
SOMERSET
Where was the prostitute? Where was
she?
The crazed man leans forward in his chair.
CRAZED MAN
She was...  she was on the bed. She
was just sitting on the bed.
SOMERSET
Who tied her down? You or him?
CRAZED MAN
He had a gun. He had a gun...  and he
made it happen. He made me do it!
(sobbing)
He made me put that...  that thing
on. Oh, Christ! He made me wear it... 
and...  and he told me to fuck her.
He had the gun in my mouth.
The man slides to the floor and hides his face in his hands.
CRAZED MAN
The gun was in my throat!
Somerset looks up at the mirror in his room. He stands and picks up the Polaroids as two men in institutional uniforms enter to collect the crazed man from the floor.
INT. PRECINCT HOUSE, INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY
Mills stands in this dirty room with the dirty, bald man from The Hot House's reception area booth.
MILLS
You didn't hear any screams? Nothing?
You didn't notice when this man walked
in with a package under his arm?!
BALD MAN
No, I didn't.
MILLS
You didn't notice anything wrong?
Nothing seemed strange to you?
BALD MAN
Everybody who goes in there has a
package under his arm. Some guys are
carrying suitcases full of stuff.
And, screams? There're screams coming
out of there everyday. It goes with
the territory, little boy!
MILLS
You like what you do for a living?
You like the things you see?
The bald man smiles strangely.
BALD MAN
No. No, I don't. But, that's life.
INT. PRECINCT HOUSE, SOMERSET'S OFFICE - EARLY EVENING
THE BLACKBOARD:
1	gluttony (x)	5	wrath
2	greed (x)	6	pride
3	sloth (x)	7	lust (x)
4	envy
Somerset and Mills are shell-shocked, silent, seated at their desks. Somerset is looking at the blackboard. Mills is looking at the billboard out the window.
INT. SPORTS BAR - NIGHT
Somerset and Mills sit with a full pitcher of beer. The jukebox plays for the other customers. The walls of the bar are covered with trophies, plaques and other victory symbols.
SOMERSET
The irony is, after a day of the
type of work he did, he'd come home
and read me these morbid crime
stories. Murders in the Rue Morgue.
Le Fanu's Green Tea. My mother would
give him hell because he was keeping
me up till all hours.
MILLS
Sounds like a father who wanted his
son to follow in his footsteps.
SOMERSET
One birthday he gave me this brand
new hardcover book, "The Century of
the Detective," by Jurgen Thorwald.
It traced the history of deduction
as a science, and it sealed my fate,
because it was real, not fiction.
And, that a drop of blood or a piece
of hair could solve a crime...  it
was incredible to me.
Somerset drinks, then pours more beer.
SOMERSET
You know...  there's not going to be
a happy ending to this. It's not
possible anymore.
MILLS
If we get him, I'll be happy enough.
SOMERSET
No. Face it now. Stop thinking it's
good guys against bad guys.
MILLS
How can you say that? Especially
after today?
SOMERSET
Don't try to focus on things as black
and white, because you'll go blind.
There's no winning and losing here.
MILLS
You're the oldest man I know,
Somerset.
SOMERSET
You tell me, then...  you walk into
an apartment, and a man has beaten
his wife to death, or the wife
murdered the husband, and you have
to wash the blood off their children.
You put the killer in jail. Who won?
MILLS
You do your job... 
SOMERSET
Where's the victory?
MILLS
You follow the law and do the best
you can. It's all there.
SOMERSET
Just know that in this case there's
not going to be any satisfaction. If
we caught John Doe and he were the
devil himself, if it turned out he
were actually Satan, then, that might
live up to our expectations. No human
being could do these things, right?
But, this is not the devil. It's
just a man.
MILLS
Why don't you shut the fuck up for a
while? You bitch and complain...  if
I thought like you, I would have
slit my wrist already.
Somerset sits back, looking at Mills.
MILLS
You think you're preparing me for
the hard times ahead? You think you're
toughening me up? Well, you're not!
You're quitting, fine...  but I'm
staying.
SOMERSET
People don't want a champion. They
just want to keep playing the lottery
and eating hamburgers.
MILLS
What the fuck is wrong with you?
What burnt you out?
SOMERSET
It wasn't one thing, if that's what
you mean. I just...  I can't live
here anymore. I can't live where
stupidity is embraced and nurtured
as if it were a virtue.
MILLS
Oh, you're so much better than
everyone, right? No one's worthy of
you.
SOMERSET
Wrong! I sympathize completely,
because if you can't win...  then, if
you don't ignore everything and
everyone around you, you...  you become
like John Doe. It's easier to beat a
child than it is to raise it, because
it takes so much work to love. You
just have to make sure you don't
stop to think about the abuse, and
the damage, because you'll risk being
sad. Keep ignoring.
MILLS
You're talking about people who are
mentally ill. You're... 
SOMERSET
No I'm not! I'm talking about common,
everyday life here. If you let
yourself worry about one thing, you'll
worry about the next, and the next,
and it never ends. In this place,
ignorance isn't just bliss, it's a
matter of survival.
MILLS
Listen to yourself. You say, "the
problem with people is they don't
care, so I don't care about people."
But, you're already here. You've
been here a long time. So, there's a
part of you that knows, even if
everything you say is true, none of
it matters.
SOMERSET
That part of me is dead.
Mills stands.
MILLS
You want me to agree with you: "Yeah,
you're right, Somerset. This is a
fucked place. Let's go live in a
fucking log cabin." Well, I don't
agree with you. You're giving up,
and it makes me sick, because you're
the best I've ever seen.
Mills throws some money on the table.
MILLS
Thanks for the beer.
Mills leaves, other patrons watching him.
Somerset takes out a cigarette and goes to light it. The lighter will not light, and when it does, Somerset's hand is trembling.
INT. MILLS' APARTMENT, BEDROOM - NIGHT
Mills comes quietly into the dark bedroom. Tracy is asleep on the bed. Mills takes off his suit jacket, puts it down. He sits on a chair and unties one shoe, takes it off, then
looks at Tracy. Looks at her a long moment.
He puts the shoe on the floor and goes to get on the bed. He kisses his wife's forehead, kisses her cheek, then wraps his arms under and around her. He holds her tight, kisses her again. Tracy stirs.
TRACY
Honey?
Mills runs his fingers along her face.
MILLS
I love you.
Mills holds her tighter. She wraps her arms around him. They lie together, clinging, holding tighter still.
INT. MILLS' APARTMENT BUILDING/STREET - NIGHT
Through the window of the apartment, we can see Tracy and Mills on the bed. CAMERA MOVES from this window, to the street.
CAMERA CONTINUES down the night street, to a car far from Mills' building. Inside the car, John Doe sits, looking up at Mills' window. Doe looks as plain as white bread. He adjusts his thick glasses, sips from a coffee cup.
INT. SOMERSET'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - NIGHT
Somerset is in bed. The metronome is sounding; tick...  tick... 
tick...  The SOUNDS of the CITY are LOUD.
Somerset closes his eyes, concentrating on the metronome.
Tick...  tick...  tick...  TWO MEN are HEARD from outside, YELLING at each other. Somerset rolls over, restless. Tick...  tick...  tick... 
GLASS is HEARD SHATTERING. Somerset opens his eyes. MORE GLASS, bottles being smashed. Somerset sits up. He reaches over, grabs the metronome and throws it against the wall.
INT. SOMERSET'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - LATER NIGHT
THWACK. Somerset's switchblade hits the dartboard on the wall and the blade embeds.
Somerset crosses the room, still dressed for bed. He is tense. He takes the switchblade from the dartboard, paces back across the room, turns, holds the blade, then throws. The blade sticks.
Somerset paces back to the dartboard, pulls the blade, paces back, throws the knife. THWACK. He goes to the board, gets the blade, paces, turns, throws. THWACK.
INSERT -- TITLE CARD
SATURDAY
INT. JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT, MAIN ROOM - DAY
A clock on the wall says 12:30.
INT. JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT, ROOM TWO - DAY
Three deputy detectives are reading John Doe's notebooks.
PHONE RINGS from the other room.
INT. JOHN DOE'S APARMENT, MAIN ROOM - DAY
One deputy enters. He goes to the phone near the bed. The phone's been hooked into recording device with a speaker and tracing equipment. The deputy turns everything on, answers.
JOHN DOE (V.O.)
(through speaker)
I've gone and done it again.
INT. LUXURY APARTMENT, BATHROOM - DAY
Somerset is looking around this femininely decorated bathroom with a forensic, GIL. Both wear rubber gloves.
At the sink, objects covered in blood: a pair of scissors, a hypodermic needle, first-aid tape and gauze bandages, a bottle of anesthetic, a straight razor and a tube of super glue.
GIL
He really did a number on her, didn't
he?
Gil opens the plastic shower curtain and looks into the tub. The tub and shower wall are splattered with blood. The tub has a few inches of water in it. The water is cloudy red. A few bits of tape and gauze float in it. Gil jiggles the drain's knob. Some bubbles pop up from the clogged drain.
INT. LUXURY APARTMENT, BEDROOM - DAY
PRIDE is written in lipstick on a full length mirror. Below that: I DID NOT KILL HER. SHE WAS GIVEN A CHOICE.
Mills and Dr. O'Neill are in the room. O'Neill goes through his black bag. They're by a bed where a WOMAN lies dead under a blanket. The woman's head is sloppily bandaged with heavy white gauze and tape. The gauze is stained by spots of blood. Only the eyes and mouth have been left uncovered. A zoo's worth of stuffed animals have been placed across the bed. The woman holds a stuffed unicorn.
Somerset enters from the bathroom as Mills reaches to take the unicorn from the woman's grasp. There is a cordless phone in her left hand, and her and clings to it.
Her right hand holds a bottle of prescription pills. Mills
tries to open the fingers of this hand with a tongue depressor, but they are super-glued to the bottle. Mills turns the woman's hand slightly so two red pills roll out onto the blanket.
SOMERSET
Sleeping pills.
Mills examines the left hand. The phone is glued into it.
O'Neill steps up, holding a thin pair of silver scissors. He leans to slide the scissors under the woman's bandage mask, starts cutting.
Somerset goes to a dresser where the woman's purse sits open.
He takes out the driver's license and looks at the photo.
The woman in the picture is stunningly beautiful.
SOMERSET
You see what he did?
Mills is watching the doctor work.
MILLS
He cut her up and dressed the wounds.
SOMERSET
(holds up his left
hand)
Call for help, and you'll live.
But, you'll be disfigured.
(raises right hand)
Or, put yourself out of your misery.
O'Neill removes the bandages. Mills looks away. We do not see.
O'Neill looks to the detectives.
O'NEILL
He cut off her nose to spite her
face, and he did it very recently.
EXT. CITY STREET - DAY
Mills' car pulls up in front of the precinct house. Mills and Somerset get out. They wade through cars towards the old precinct house building.
SOMERSET
I've decided to stay on this, till
it's over. Till it's either done or
we can both see it's never going to
finish.
Mills remains impassive.
MILLS
Oh, you want to stay now?
SOMERSET
One of two things will happen. We're
either going to get John Doe, or
he'll finish his series of seven,
and this case will go on for years.
MILLS
You think you're doing me a big favor
by staying?
SOMERSET
I'm requesting you keep me on as
your partner a few more days. You'd
be doing me the favor.
Mills walks on.
MILLS
You knew I'd say yes.
SOMERSET
No, actually, I wasn't sure at all.
Somerset and Mills climb the steps of the precinct house.
Behind them, in the street, John Doe's car pulls up and parks.
Cars behind begin BEEPING. People behind begin cursing and screaming for him to move.
John Doe steps out, his brown work boots, pants and shirttails are splattered with blood.
He walks towards the precinct house, hands in his pockets, like he's out for a stroll. People on the sidewalk stop on seeing him, avoid him.
INT. PRECINCT HOUSE, RECEIVING LOBBY - DAY
Mills and Somerset walk past booking cubicles and benches of handcuffed low-lifes. Junkies are being led through by uniformed cops. The place is swimming with activity. The two detectives head to the wide duty desk at the end of the room.
SOMERSET
As soon as this is over, I'm gone.
MILLS
Big surprise.
They pass through a gate and Somerset goes towards a staircase leading upstairs. Mills stops at the duty desk. Other cops are vying for the DUTY SERGEANT'S attention.
MILLS
Mills and Somerset are on the
premises.
SERGEANT
Wonder-fucking-ful.
Another PLAIN CLOTHES COP behind the duty desk leans over to hold out a few phone-message note to Mills.
PLAIN CLOTHES COP
Your wife called this morning. Do us
a favor and get yourself an answering
machine, how bout it?
Mills nods and wave dismissively, pocketing the messages without looking at them and walking to follow Somerset.
JOHN DOE (O.S.)
Detective.
Mills heads toward the stairs.
JOHN DOE (O.S.)
Detective!
Mills looks back...  stops.
John Doe stands inside the precinct house doors. He gives a very slight smile.
JOHN DOE
I know you.
Somerset stops, looks back down the stairs.
Mills is staring at Doe, not comprehending.
Doe holds up his arms as if to say, "Presto, here I am." All eyes go to the blood-soaked figure of John Doe. There comes a sudden, near-silence in the room.
One UNIFORMED COP takes out his gun, points it at John Doe.
UNIFORMED COP
It's him!
Several other cops drop what they're doing and draw weapons.
Mills, still off balance, takes out his own gun, walking back through the gate. He points the gun at John Doe.
MILLS
Get down. Get down on the floor.
Cops move slowly in on Doe from all sides.
ANOTHER COP
You heard him, fuckface. Get down!
Somerset comes back through the gate.
SOMERSET
Be careful!
John Doe gets down on his knees, hands in the air. Mills, pulse pounding, steps up, gun in both hands. Not too close.
MILLS
Down! Face on the floor!
ONE COP comes from behind and nudges Doe with his foot.
ONE COP
Spread your legs and get your hands
out in front of you!
John Doe lies on his stomach, obeying. Mills comes up and puts his gun right against Doe's head.
MILLS
Don't move. Don't move an inch.
One cop begins frisking Doe. Another comes to put on cuffs.
Somerset comes to Mills' side.
SOMERSET
I don't believe it.
JOHN DOE
(to Somerset)
Hello.
The cop putting on the handcuffs looks up at Somerset and Mills.
COP
What the fuck is this... ?
The cop holds up Doe's cuffed hands. Doe winces. Every single one of Doe's fingers has a bandage wrapped around it.
John Doe tries to muster a smile, his face pressed against the floor, glasses askew, gun at his temple.
JOHN DOE
(to Mills)
I want to speak to my lawyer.
INT. PRECINCT HOUSE, OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY
Mills holds a fingerprint card. The black ink prints are just useless blobs, smeared with blood.
Mills, Somerset and the Captain stand in darkness. Mills looks up from the print card through a two-way mirror into an interrogation room.
In the interrogation room, John Doe sits, handcuffed to the wall.
This is not some superhuman serial killer.
He looks more like an eccentric college professor, not seething with anger, but looking around with calm, almost lazy eyes. The lawyer, MARK SWARR, sits taking notes and talking with Doe.
CAPTAIN
He cuts off the skin if his
fingertips. That's why we can't find
a single usable print in the
apartment. He's been doing it for
quite a while. Keeps cutting before
the papillary line can grow back.
MILLS
What about the trace on his bank
account and the guns? There must be
something to connect him with a past.
CAPTAIN
So far it's all dead ends. No credit
history. No employment history. His
bank account's only five years old
and it started as cash. We're even
trying to trace his furniture, but
for now all we know is he's
independently wealth, well educated
and totally insane. We may never
know how he got that way.
SOMERSET
Because he is John Doe, by choice.
MILLS
When do we get to question him?
CAPTAIN
You don't. It goes to court now.
MILLS
He wouldn't just turn himself in.
It doesn't make any sense.
Somerset moves from the window, crossing the room to sit.
CAPTAIN
Well, there he sits. It's not supposed
to make sense.
SOMERSET
He's not finished.
MILLS
He's pissing in our faces again and
we're just taking it.
CAPTAIN
You're wound too tight, Mills. Let
it go.
The captain walks. Mills is furious. He presses his fingers against the two-way-mirror, pushes to crack his knuckles loudly.
MILLS
(to Somerset)
You know he's fucking us.
SOMERSET
You and I are, probably for the first
time ever, in total agreement. He
wouldn't just stop.
MILLS
Well...  what the fuck, man?
SOMERSET
He's only two murders away from
finishing his masterpiece, right?
Can you even conceive of what's going
to happen next? I mean, can you even
imagine how he'll try to finish it?
Mills looks in at John Doe. Somerset comes to stand beside.
MILLS
No.
SOMERSET
I can tell you this. I recognize his
lawyer. His name's Mark Swarr.
Mills looks at Somerset.
SOMERSET
He's the one who got Victor out.
(pause)
We'll wait for John Doe's plea.
INT. PRECINCT HOUSE, SOMERSET'S OFFICE - DAY
Mills is at the desk, feet up.	He stares at the blackboard.
1	gluttony (x)	5	wrath
2	greed (x)	6	pride (x)
3	sloth (x)	7	lust (x)
4	envy
Clock on the wall says 4:45. Somerset is packing books into boxes, preparing for his eventual departure.
The captain steps into the office and clears his throat, looking like there is something making him very unhappy.
INT. PRECINCT HOUSE, CAPTAIN'S OFFICE - DAY
Mills and Somerset stand together. The captain is behind his
desk with Martin Talbot, the D.A., seated in front of him. Mark Swarr is addressing them all, seems nervous but in control.
SWARR
My client says there are two more
bodies...  two more victims, hidden
away. He will take Detectives Mills
and Somerset to these bodies, but
only Detectives Mills and Somerset.
Only at six o'clock today.
Talbot wipes his moist brow with a handkerchief.
TALBOT
Oh, Christ.
MILLS
Why us?
SWARR
He says he admires you.
SOMERSET
(to captain)
This is all part of his game plan.
SWARR
My client claims that if the
detectives do not accept this offer,
these two bodies will never be found.
CAPTAIN
Frankly, counselor, I'm inclined to
let them rot.
TALBOT
We don't make deals, Mr. Swarr.
Mills gets in Swarr's face.
MILLS
How is it working for a scumbag like
this? You proud of yourself?
CAPTAIN
Ease back, Mills.
SWARR
I'm required by law to serve my
clients to the best of my ability,
and to serve their best interests.
Mills back off.
CAPTAIN
Well, we're going to have to pass.
SWARR
My client...  he also wishes to inform
you, if you do not accept, he will
plead insanity, across the board.
TALBOT
(to no one in
particular)
Let him try! I'd like to see him
try!
SWARR
Come now, Martin. We all know, with
the extreme nature of these crimes,
I could get him off with such a plea.
Talbot considers this, wringing the handkerchief in his hands.
Mills looks at Somerset. Somerset looks at him.
TALBOT
I'm not letting this conviction slide,
I can tell you that right here and
right now!
SWARR
He says, if you accept, under his
specific conditions, he will sign a
full confession and plead guilty... 
right here, right now.
Talbot glares at Swarr.
CAPTAIN
(to Mills)
What do you think?
MILLS
I'm in.
SWARR
It has to be both of you.
SOMERSET
If he were to claim insanity, this
conversation is admissible. The fact
that he's blackmailing us with his
plea... 
SWARR
And, my client reminds you, two more
are dead. The press would have a
field day if they found out the police
didn't seem too concerned about
finding them...  giving them a proper
burial.
SOMERSET
If there really are two more dead.
The captain picks up a sheet from his desk.
CAPTAIN
The lab report came up from downtown,
They did a quickie on Doe's clothing
and fingernails. They found blood
from Doe, from him cutting his own
fingers...  there was blood from the
woman whose face he cut off, and
blood from a third party. As yet
unidentified.
TALBOT
(to Somerset)
You would be escorting an unarmed
man.
Somerset thinks it over. He looks to Mills.
MILLS
Let's finish it.
Somerset looks at the floor, then at Swarr.
SOMERSET
(to the captain)
Well...  get the fucking lawyer out
of the room and we can talk about
how this whole thing's going to go
down.
INT. PRECINCT HOUSE, BATHROOM/LOCKER ROOM - DAY
Somerset's hand reaches to the sink to pick up a razor.
Somerset and	Mills are	at the	sinks, looking at themselves
in mirrors,	shirtless.	They	have shaving cream	spread across
their chests. Somerset	flicks	his	cigarette in	the	sink,
then brings	the	razor up to	start	shaving the hair	off his
chest. Mills	is	already doing	the	same.
SOMERSET
If John Doe's head splits open and a
U.F.O. flies out, I want you to have
expected it.
MILLS
I will.
They continue shaving.
MILLS
If I were to accidentally cut off
one of my nipple, would that be
covered by workman's compensation?
Somerset smiles just slightly.
SOMERSET
I suppose so.
(pause)
If you were man enough to actually
file the claim, I'd buy you a new
one out of my own pocket.
Mills finishes shaving, washes and wipes his chest off with a towel. He turns dead serious.
MILLS
Listen, Somerset...  I uh... 
Mills pauses, sighs. Somerset stops shaving and looks at him.
SOMERSET
What is it?
MILLS
Well, I have to tell you... 
(pause)
I think I've fallen in love with
you.
SOMERSET
(shakes his head)
Slut.
MILLS
(laughs, walking out)
Kiss me on the lips.
SOMERSET
(still shaving)
Give me a break.
INT. PRECINCT HOUSE, READY ROOM - DAY
Somerset and Mills have their shirts open. A female technician tapes a small radio transmitter and microphone to Mills' chest.
Somerset is already wired up, pressing the adhesive to make sure it'll hold.
The technician finishes prepping Mills. Somerset buttons up
his shirt. The technician packs up her kit, leaving. The
room is quiet. Somerset picks up his bullet-proof vest, slides
into it.
Mills looks at his watch. He puts on his own vest, fastening it tight. He looks at Somerset.
Somerset takes out a roll of antacids and pops a few.
Mills holds out his hand and waits for an antacid. Somerset looks at him, flicks a few into Mills' palm. Mills chews them.
SOMERSET
Stay as cold as ice.
Somerset picks up his gun off a chair. Mills picks up his gun.
They both check them out and close them up. They lay the guns in holsters at the small of their backs.
They look at each other. Somerset holds out his hand. Mills shakes it.
INT. CITY STREET, PRECINCT HOUSE FRONT - DAY
The street is full of shadows as the sun is falling low. At the front of the precinct house, a throng of reporters shifts anxiously. A line of policemen holds them back.
Martin Talbot steps out of the precinct house, cops on either side of him. The press swarm lurches forward, flashbulbs exploding. Talbot holds out his hands, preparing to speak.
EXT. CITY STREET, PRECINCT HOUSE REAR - DAY
At the rear of the precinct house, Somerset's car pulls out of the fenced in parking lot. The car speeds up on the street and turns a corner, heading into the grim city.
EXT. SKYSCRAPER ROOFTOP - DAY
California is dressed in full battle gear, looking through binoculars to the city below. The wind blows hard.
A PILOT, holding two helmets, comes up behind California. A sleek police helicopter sits on the roof's helipad.
CALIFORNIA
Is this wind going to hurt us?
PILOT
Just makes the ride more fun.
The cocky pilot grins.
INT. SOMERSET'S CAR - DAY
Somerset is at the wheel. Mills is in the passenger's seat, looking back at John Doe through protective wire mesh. Doe's in the back seat. His handcuffs are attached to ankle cuffs by a length of chain. He is dressed in gray pants and a gray shirt, looking out the window, sweaty but placid.
SOMERSET
Who are you, John? Who are you really?
John Doe looks to Somerset's eyes in the rearview mirror.
JOHN DOE
What do you mean?
SOMERSET
I mean, at this point, what would it
hurt if you told us a little about
yourself?
JOHN DOE
(pause)
It doesn't matter who I am. Who I am
means absolutely nothing.
(looking out, to
Somerset)
You need to turn left here...  at the
traffic light.
MILLS
Where we headed?
JOHN DOE
You'll see.
Mills looks at Doe for a long time in silence.
MILLS
We're not just going to pick up two
more bodies, are we, Johnny? That
wouldn't be...  shocking enough.
Wouldn't keep you on the front page
of the newspapers.
JOHN DOE
Wanting people to pay attention, you
can't just tap them on the shoulder.
You have to hit them in the head
with a sledgehammer. Then, you have
their strict attention.
MILLS
What makes you so special that people
should pay attention?
JOHN DOE
Not me. I'm not special. I'm not
exceptional.
(pause)
This is, though. What I'm doing.
MILLS
I hate to burst your bubble, but
other than the fact that you're
especially sadistic, there's nothing
unusual about these precious murders
of yours.
JOHN DOE
You know that's not true.
MILLS
In two months, no one's going to
even remember this happened.
Doe looks down for a moment, then looks up, almost shyly.
JOHN DOE
You can't see the whole...  the whole
complete act yet. Not yet. But, when
this is done, it's going to be... 
so...  so... 
MILLS
Spit it out.
JOHN DOE
It's going to be flawless. People
will barely be able to comprehend
it. It will seem almost surreal... 
but it will have a tangible reality,
so they won't be able to deny it.
Doe looks down, licking his lips. He clenches his hands into fists, digging his bandaged fingertips into his sweaty palms.
JOHN DOE
I can't wait for you to see. I can't
wait... 
(pause, looks to Mills)
It's really going to be something.
MILLS
Well, I'll be standing beside you
the whole time, so you be sure to
let me know when this whole, complete
reality thing is done. Wouldn't want
to miss it.
JOHN DOE
Oh, don't worry. You won't... 
INT. POLICE HELICOPTER - DAY
The helicopter is in flight above the city. California is strapped in, hanging out the door. He holds a high powered automatic rifle, wears goggles and a helmet/headset.
JOHN DOE (V.O.)
(through headset)
... you won't miss a thing.
Two other armed cops sit in the belly of the chopper.
California leans in and looks up towards the pilot.
CALIFORNIA
(into helmet microphone)
Head over the bridge and keep them
in sight. Just keep your distance.
The pilot looks back and nods.
EXT. CITY SKY - DAY
The chopper dips, flying like a bullet over the polluted city, heading towards the setting sun.
EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY
Somerset's car moves along a highway at river's edge. Heading for a huge suspension bridge filled with speeding traffic ahead.
INT. SOMERSET'S CAR - DAY
John Doe has his head against the window, looking up at the bridge, excited. He sits back, glances out the back window, then faces front, bites his lip, fidgety, like a kid on Christmas Eve.
Somerset's watching him through the rearview mirror.
SOMERSET
What's so exciting?
JOHN DOE
It's not too far away now.
JOHN DOE
(long pause)
I...  I doubt I enjoyed it any more
than...  Detective Mills would enjoy
some time alone with me in a room
without windows.
(looks to Mills)
Isn't that true? How happy would it
make you to hurt me, with impunity?
MILLS
(coy mocking)
Now...  I wouldn't do something like
that, Johnny. I like you. I like you
a lot.
JOHN DOE
You wouldn't because you know there
are consequences. It's in those eyes
of yours, though...  nothing wrong
with a man taking pleasure in his
work.
(pause, shakes his
head)
I won't deny my own personal desire
to turn each sin against the sinner.
I only took their sins to logical
conclusions.
MILLS
You only killed a bunch of innocent
people so you could get your rocks
off. That's all.
JOHN DOE
Innocent? Is that supposed to be
funny? Look at the people I killed.
An obese man, a disgusting man who
could barely stand up...  who if you
saw him on the street, you'd point
so your friends could mock him along
with you. Who if you saw him while
you were eating, you wouldn't be
able to finish	your meal. After him
I picked the lawyer. And, you both
must have been secretly thanking me
for that one. This was a man who
dedicated his life to making money
by lying with every breath he could
muster...  to keeping rapists and
murderers on the streets.
MILLS
Murderers?
JOHN DOE
(ignoring)
A woman... 
MILLS
Murderers like you?
JOHN DOE
(ignoring, louder)
A woman...  so ugly on the inside
that she couldn't bare to go on living
if she couldn't be beautiful on the
outside. A drug dealer...  a drug
dealing pederast, actually.
(laughs at that one)
And, don't forget the disease
spreading whore. Only in a world
this shitty could you even try to
say these were innocent people and
keep a straight face.
(getting worked up)
That's the point. You see a deadly
sin on almost every street corner,
and in every home, literally. And we
tolerate it. Because it's common, it
seems trivial, and we tolerate, all
day long, morning, noon and night.
Not anymore. I'm setting the example,
and it's going to be puzzled over
and studied and followed, from now
on.
MILLS
Delusions of grandeur.
JOHN DOE
You should be thanking me.
MILLS
And, why is that?
JOHN DOE
You're going to be remembered, and
it's all because of me. And, the
only reason I'm here right now is
because I wanted to be.
MILLS
We would have gotten you eventually.
JOHN DOE
Really? Just biding your time, then?
Toying with me. Is that it? Letting
five people die until you finally
felt like going out and hauling me
in?
Doe sits forward, slowly getting to Mills.
JOHN DOE
(angrily)
Tell me what it was that gave me
away. What was the piece of evidence
you were going to use against me
right before I walked up to YOU and
put my hands in the air.
MILLS
I seem to remember knocking on your
door.
JOHN DOE
And, I remember breaking your nose.
(leans further forward)
You're only alive because I didn't
kill you.
MILLS
Sit back.
John Doe doesn't sit back, staying very close to the wire mesh.
JOHN DOE
I spared you, and you're going to
have to remember that every time you
look in the mirror at that nose on
your face for the rest of your life.
Or, I should say, for the rest of
what life I've allowed you to have.
Mills slams his fist against the mesh, fed up, furious.
MILLS
I said, sit back, freak. Sit back
and shut your fucking mouth!
Doe sits back, taking a deep breath and letting it out.
In the front seat, Somerset shoots a concerned glance at Mills, then looks up into the rearview mirror.
IN THE MIRROR: Doe, calm, gives Somerset a smile.
Doe then turns his attention back out the passenger window, watching the world pass by, his face pressed to the glass.
Mills sits forward in his seat, letting his anger come down.
Doe keeps staring out the window. A long pause.
JOHN	DOE
Don't ask	me	to	pity the people I
killed. I	don't	mourn them	anymore
than I mourn	the	thousands	who died
in Sodom and	Gomorrah.
Mills almost lets this pass, but can't. Blunted anger:
MILLS
You fuck. You really think what you
did was God's good work?
Pause. John Doe is pressing his forefinger into the tip of his thumb, causing blood to drip from under the bandage.
JOHN DOE
The Lord works in mysterious ways.
EXT. SKY - EARLY EVENING
The helicopter flies over huge, blackened industrial parks, past smokestacks spewing soot. The sky is turning crimson.
INT. POLICE HELICOPTER - EARLY EVENING
California leans way out looking back at the city.
EXT. INDUSTRIAL ROAD - EARLY EVENING
Somerset's car comes down this rocky, deserted strip, towards the industrial parks. The car tosses dirt into the air where it is captured on the wind.
EXT. SKY - EARLY EVENING
The chopper roars, low, close to the stretch of industrial road.
This is the only road through vast swampy fields. The industrial parks are far behind.
INT. POLICE HELICOPTER - EARLY EVENING
California still leans out, gun poised, looks over the fields.
CALIFORNIA
There ain't no ambush out here. There
ain't no fucking nothing out here.
PILOT (V.O.)
(through headset)
We got about two minutes before they
come up behind us.
CALIFORNIA
Go high. Way up. In sixty seconds,
cut to the west.
EXT. SKY - EARLY EVENING
The chopper climbs, really moving.
EXT. INDUSTRIAL ROAD - EARLY EVENING
Somerset's car comes down the road, surrounded by marshlands.
The car slows, then stops. Mills gets out and goes to extract Doe. Somerset gets out, looking east to the industrial parks and city beyond. The sky is darkening.
Somerset walks and looks to the west. The sky is red. Very far away, a passenger train moves towards the hidden sun.
Somerset watches the train, walking to the edge of the roadway. He looks down and steps back from what he sees.
A dead dog lies in the weeds, old and moldering.
Somerset turns to the car, where John Doe stands with Mills.
Doe points with his cuffed hands to the dog, grins.
JOHN DOE
I didn't do that.
EXT. MARSHLANDS - EARLY EVENING
The wind howls, pounding on John Doe as he walks through the
swampy field. He walks slowly, encumbered by the deep muck
and by the short chain between his ankles. Mills is with
Doe, disgusted by the ooze covering his shoes and pants cuffs.
He looks ahead, cautious. Somerset walks behind them.
Doe keeps looking back towards the car on the industrial road.
MILLS
What are you looking for?
Doe looks forward.
JOHN DOE
What time is it?
SOMERSET
Why?
Somerset looks at his watch. It's one minute after seven.
JOHN DOE
I want to know.
Mills gives Doe a shove.
Somerset looks back towards the industrial road, worried.
MILLS
Just keep leading the way.
JOHN DOE
It's close.
SOMERSET
Mills!
Mills and Doe look back at Somerset. Somerset is facing the industrial road, pointing. A van is coming, dust flying.
Somerset looks at Mills. Mills looks at Somerset. They take out their guns. Somerset starts towards the road.
SOMERSET
Stay with him.
MILLS
Wait!
SOMERSET
There's no time to discuss it!
Somerset runs to head off the van.
John Doe begins walking to follow Somerset.
JOHN DOE
There he goes.
Mills levels his gun at John Doe's head.
EXT. MARSHLANDS, NEAR INDUSTRIAL ROAD - EARLY EVENING
Somerset runs, breathing hard, opening the top of his bullet-proof vest to speak into his hidden microphone.
SOMERSET
There's a van...  coming down the
industrial road. Coming from the
east.
INT. POLICE HELICOPTER - EARLY EVENING
The chopper is circling in the air, far from the marshlands with the sun behind it. Another cop is in the hatchway beside California, looking through binoculars.
SOMERSET (V.O.)
(from headset)
The van is coming from the east. I
don't know what it is. Come around.
Come around.
EXT. MARSHLANDS, NEAR INDUSTRIAL ROAD - EARLY EVENING
Somerset continues, charging through the mire.
SOMERSET
Just get ready for anything and wait
for my signal. Wait for me.
EXT. MARSHLANDS - EARLY EVENING
Mills keeps the gun on John Doe, watches Somerset far off.
JOHN DOE
It's good we have some time to talk.
Doe starts walking again.
MILLS
Get down. Get down on your knees!
Mills grabs Doe and pushes Doe's knees out with his foot, making Doe kneel in the brown water.
Mills positions himself behind Doe so that Doe is between him and the road. Now, Mills can keep the gun on Mills and still watch Somerset.
EXT. MARSHLANDS, INDUSTRIAL ROAD - EARLY EVENING
Somerset comes up on the road, near his car. He signals for the van to stop, then fires a warning shot in the air. The van is about one hundred yards away, still coming.
Somerset walks towards it, breathless, pointing his gun.
SOMERSET
Stop the van! Stop!
The van brakes, wheels sliding on the loose roadway. Stops.
Somerset moves up to it, staying about ten feet away.
SOMERSET
Get out! Get out with your hands on
your head! Do it now!
The driver of the van, a DELIVERYMAN, pushes the door open and slides out, slow, takes off his sunglasses.
DELIVERYMAN
Jesus Christ, man, don't shoot me!
SOMERSET
Turn around. Hands on your head!
DELIVERYMAN
What the hell's going on?
SOMERSET
Who are you? What are you doing out
here?
DELIVERYMAN
I'm...  I'm just delivering a package.
INT. POLICE HELICOPTER - EARLY EVENING
California listens as the chopper spins over industrial parks.
DELIVERYMAN (V.O.)
(through headset)
It's just a package for this guy... 
David. Detective David Mills.
CALIFORNIA
Motherfucker.
The pilot looks back at California.
PILOT
Let's do it.
CALIFORNIA
No! Wait for Somerset!
EXT. MARSHLANDS - EARLY EVENING
Mills and Doe can see Somerset keeping his distance from the deliveryman. The deliveryman moves to the back of the van and opens the van's rear door.
JOHN DOE
When I said I admired you...  I meant
what I said. I do admire you.
Mills keeps his eyes on the van, but steps up to place his gun at the back of Doe's head. Pulls the hammer back.
MILLS
Shut up.
EXT. MARSHLANDS, INDUSTRIAL ROAD - EARLY EVENING
The deliveryman takes a brown package, about a foot square, from the van.
DELIVERYMAN
This guy paid me five hundred bucks
to bring it out here. He wanted it
here at exactly seven o'clock.
SOMERSET
Put it down. Put it on the ground.
DELIVERYMAN
Okay... 
He puts it on the road and backs away, holding up his hands.
Somerset glances into the field to see Doe on his knees with Mills behind him. Somerset looks at the package. Written on top: DETECTIVE DAVID MILLS -- HANDLE WITH CARE.
SOMERSET
(to deliveryman)
Go. Get out of here!
The deliveryman backs off, then scrambles into the van. Somerset pulls back his bullet-proof vest and speaks into the mic.
SOMERSET
There's a package here. It's from
John Doe.
The van tears away. Somerset doesn't know what to do. He walks around the package, reholsters his gun.
SOMERSET
I	don't know...  I don't know... 
He looks out towards Doe and Mills.
INT. HELICOPTER - EARLY EVENING
California waits, listening, looking into the blood-red sky.
SOMERSET (.O.)
(through headset)
I'm going to have to open it.
EXT. MARSHLANDS - EARLY EVENING
Mills watches Somerset kneel beside the package on the road.
JOHN DOE
I wish I could have been a normal
man like you. I wish I could have a
simple life.
MILLS
What the fuck is going on here?!
EXT. MARSHLANDS, INDUSTRIAL ROAD - EARLY EVENING
Somerset pulls his switchblade, clicks it open.
He cuts across the top of the box, hands shaking, cuts quickly.
He pulls the box open, pulls at some bubble-wrap inside.
INT. POLICE HELICOPTER - EARLY EVENING
The pilot grits his teeth.
PILOT
(into helmet mic)
Let's go!
CALIFORNIA
We are going to wait!
California listens.
SOMERSET (V.O.)
(through headset)
Oh, Christ...  oh Christ... 
EXT. MARSHLANDS, INDUSTRIAL ROAD - EARLY EVENING
Somerset stumbles backwards, away from the open box. He is white as a sheet, eyes filled with numb fear. He leans against his car for support, wretches, sick, holds the back of his hand to his mouth.
SOMERSET
No... 
EXT. MARSHLANDS - EARLY EVENING
Mills is watching Somerset, grabs John Doe by the shirt.
MILLS
Get up. Stand up! Let's go!
Doe stands, tries to walk. Mills is walking quickly, towards Somerset. Doe can't keep up.
JOHN DOE
You've made a good life for
yourself... 
MILLS
Shut up!
Doe falls and Mills starts dragging him through the reeds.
EXT. MARSHLANDS, INDUSTRIAL ROAD - EARLY EVENING
Somerset wipes saliva from his lips and tears from his eyes.
He takes a deep breath, looks to see Mills dragging Doe.
SOMERSET
Oh, fuck, no... 
Somerset straightens, tries to pull himself together. He swallows, draws his gun.
SOMERSET
(into hidden mic)
Listen...  listen to me. Whatever you
do...  don't come in here. Stay away.
No matter what you hear, do not move
in!
(starts towards Mills)
John Doe has the upper hand.
Somerset picks up his switchblade and flips the blade back in.
He enters the marsh.
EXT. MARSHLANDS - EARLY EVENING
Mills sees Somerset coming and pulls Doe so that Doe stands.
JOHN DOE
(quietly, watching)
Here he comes.
MILLS
(shouts to Somerset)
What the fuck is going on?
JOHN DOE
(to Mills)
I want you to know, I wish I could
have lived like you do.
Somerset starts running towards Mills, mud splattering.
SOMERSET
Mills...  put down your gun! Throw it
away!
Mills leaves Doe behind, walks towards Somerset, gun down.
MILLS
What?
Somerset is fifty yards away and closing.
SOMERSET
Throw your gun down now!
MILLS
What are you talking about? What
happened?
JOHN DOE
Are you listening to me, Detective
Mills? I'm trying to tell you how
much I admire you...  and your pretty
wife Tracy.
Mills freezes, turns to Doe. Doe smiles. Somerset is close.
SOMERSET
Throw your weapon, detective! Now!
MILLS
(to John Doe)
What did you say?
JOHN DOE
It's surprising how easily a member
of the press can purchase information
from the men in your precinct.
SOMERSET
David...  please... 
JOHN DOE
I visited your home this morning,
after you left.
Mills is filled with an aching terror.
JOHN DOE
I tried to play husband...  tried to
taste the life of a simple man, but
it didn't work out. So, I took a
souvenir.
Mills turns to look at Somerset with pleading eyes. Somerset holds out his hand.
SOMERSET
Give me the gun.
JOHN DOE
Her pretty head.
MILLS
Somerset... 
JOHN DOE
Because I envy your normal life.
Envy is my sin.
Somerset can't hold back tears.
Fury rises in Mills and he turns to level his gun at John Doe.
Somerset raises his gun and points it at Mills.
SOMERSET
No!
Mills sees Somerset's gun, raises his gun to Somerset.
MILLS
Tell me it's not true.
SOMERSET
I can't let you do this... 
Mills steps forward, enraged.
MILLS
Put your gun down!!
SOMERSET
Don't do this...  please... 
MILLS
Put the gun down, Somerset!
A pause. Somerset's gun hand is trembling. The wind whips across them. The HELICOPTER can be HEARD distantly. Somerset throws his gun down.
SOMERSET
David, listen to me... 
Mills goes to grab John Doe by the throat and puts the gun to Doe's forehead, blind with rage.
Somerset holds his hand behind his back, opens his switchblade.
SOMERSET
He wants this! He wants you to do
it!
Doe is staring into Mills' eyes with wild expectation.
JOHN DOE
Kill me.
Doe lowers his head, waiting for execution.
Mills holds the gun at Doe's head, undecided, furious.
Somerset edges towards them.
MILLS
(looks to Somerset)
Stop it! You stay away!
Somerset moves the switchblade so he's holding it by the blade, ready to throw, keeping it hidden.
SOMERSET
I can't let you do this!
Mills kicks Doe and throws him backwards on the ground. The HELICOPTER is CLOSER.
Mills stands over Doe and points the gun.
JOHN DOE
She begged for her life, and for the
life of your baby inside her.
Mills' face fills with confusion -- then a wave of horror.
Doe's eyes register shock.
JOHN DOE
You didn't know.
SOMERSET
NO!
Somerset brings his hand out to throw the blade, but Mills reacts to the movement, turns on Somerset and fires -- BLAM!
Somerset flies backwards in the air, bullet exploding into his shoulder, just above the bullet-proof vest's opening.
Somerset hits the ground, crying out, bloody, writhing.
Mills turns the gun on John Doe.
INT. POLICE HELICOPTER - EARLY EVENING
The chopper is over the marshland. California is leaning out with his rifle. He cringes from the sounds as FROM HIS HEADSET is HEARD: BLAM -- BLAM -- BLAM -- BLAM -- BLAM.
INSERT -- TITLE CARD
TWO WEEKS LATER
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
Somerset sits in a wheelchair. He is dressed in a hospital gown.
His upper chest and shoulder are wrapped in bandages. He stares out the window at the city's buildings.
CAPTAIN (O.S.)
Hey there, Somerset.
Somerset turns to see the captain. Somerset looks weak, older.
SOMERSET
Hello.
The captain walks in, carrying something behind his back.
CAPTAIN
How you feeling?
SOMERSET
I can breathe without pain now, so I
guess I feel great.
Somerset musters a lame smile. The captain sits on the bed.
CAPTAIN
The guys at the precinct heard you're
getting out today. Anyway, we all
chipped in... 
The captain takes a big tool belt full of tools from behind his back. He hands it over. Somerset looks at it and lays it on his lap. He smiles for real.
SOMERSET
Thank you. Tell them, thank you.
CAPTAIN
We figure you need all the tools you
can get to fix up that piece of shit
you call a house.
SOMERSET
Yeah, that's true.
Somerset continues examining the tools.
CAPTAIN
They're hoping you stop and say
goodbye before you go, but I told
them not to expect it.
SOMERSET
(not looking up)
It would be too hard.
The captain stands.
CAPTAIN
I have to get going, but...  there is
one more thing.
Somerset looks up. The captain takes a letter from his pocket.
CAPTAIN
I don't know if you're going to want
it. It was down front. It's from
Mills.
Somerset pauses, then puts out his hand to take it.
CAPTAIN
He's being arraigned tomorrow.
SOMERSET
I read about it in the paper.
Somerset just looks at the letter.
CAPTAIN
I guess...  decide for yourself. I
don't know what it says. I'm going
to go.
SOMERSET
I'll see you.
The captain nods and walks into the hall.
Somerset wheels back to the window. He looks at the letter.
Pause. He opens it. Unfolds the paper inside.
The note reads: YOU WERE RIGHT. YOU WERE RIGHT ABOUT EVERYTHING.
Somerset closes the note, upset.
INT. HOSPITAL, MAIN NURSES' STATION - DAY
Somerset is in street clothes. He signs a form at the busy front desk. A NURSE takes the form and hands Somerset a large manila envelope.
NURSE
There you go, Mister Somerset.
"Mister" causes Somerset to look strangely at the nurse.
NURSE
Yes?
SOMERSET
Nothing.
EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY
Somerset comes down the stairs, slowly, tired. He holds the manila envelope and a small suitcase. The streets are busy with pedestrians and traffic.
He walks down the sidewalk.
He puts down the suitcase and opens the manila envelope to look inside. He sorts through the contents, takes out his keys and puts them in his pocket.
He reaches in the envelope again, and takes out the square of wallpaper with the pale, red rose on it. There is some dried blood on the paper. Somerset lays the envelope on the ground beside the suitcase.
He looks at the rose, tries to scratch off the blood.
He looks up, squinting from the sun, at the city bustling around him. At the tight canyon formed by the buildings.
At the cars, buses and taxis racing in the streets.
At a man, talking to himself, who lies on the sidewalk, surrounded by garbage.
At the people, miserable people, walking past him.
Somerset takes out the note from Mills: YOU WERE RIGHT. YOU WERE RIGHT ABOUT EVERYTHING.
A father passes by, holding his young son's hand. Somerset turns to watch them pass. The father reaches to pick the son up and carry him in his arms. The boy laughs and holds tight.
The father hugs his son to him, kisses him on the cheek. The boy returns the kiss with great affection.
Somerset watches them disappear in the mass of humanity. He looks back at the two papers in his hands. He lets out a sigh.
SOMERSET
(to himself)
Oh...  man... 
He sighs again, drained.
He puts the pale paper rose inside the note from Mills. He folds them together.
He tears them both up, into little pieces.
EXT. PRECINCT HOUSE - DAY
Cars roll by in the street. Cops come and go.
Somerset walks up the stairs, into the precinct house. The doors shut behind him.
THE END
