OPEN ON:

A MAN, standing waist-deep in the surf. White shirt, neck tie, hair perfectly parted. Wire framed glasses rest on the bridge of his nose. His name is ALEJANDRO.

He rises his face to the sun.

ALEJANDRO(V.O.)
I think about the price. The price of appetite. The cost of forgetting who we are. Pretending we are... who we will never be...

He looks young for 35, but his eyes -- seems they lived for decades before him. He closes them, bathing his face in sunshine.

ALEJANDRO (V.O.)
So easy to pretend we are not to
blame. That a demon enters us.
No... The demon is inside. We just

make potions that release it.

The muscles of his neck tense.

ALEJANDRO (V.O.)
There’s no revenge for all they
have taken. No justice. It simply

is...


His lip curls. His eyes open. He looks down.

ALEJANDRO (V.O.)
And still. They must be forced to look at all they have destroyed. By having the same done to them. Or they will forget... Forget they are human. Believe they are as different as they feel... Then they are the lion, and everything we loved and lost, simply its meal.

We hear SPLASHING and the panicked gasps of a man trying not to drown.

Only now do WE SEE: Alejandro is holding someone under the water.

He lets the drowning man catch a breath, barely. Pushes him back under. Looks out. Lost in thought.
 
2.


We watch from the beach as Alejandro stands in the ocean to his belly, the sun high overhead.

CUT TO:


YESTERDAY.

-- FRAME IS FILLED WITH A BLUE EYE, AS BLUE AS THE OCEAN --

The eye blinks, and we can almost feel a breeze -- we are that close.

WOMAN’S VOICE
(Whispered) Our Father, who art in
Heaven, hallowed be Thy Name. Thy

Kingdom come...

A VERTICAL LINE OF WHITE LIGHT invades us, then grows. The eye disappears in it’s wake.

WOMAN’S VOICE (CONT’D) Thy will be done, on Earth as it is in Heaven.

TWO DOORS swing open. We see the silhouettes of TWELVE PEOPLE DRESSED FOR BATTLE, rifles at the ready, barrels pointing up. CAMERA is so close to the woman’s face, it almost touches her. Her lips are moving, silently reciting...

We are in a SWAT ASSAULT VEHICLE. It is MOVING BACKWARDS fast and slams through a faded picket fence. Stops in the yard of a crumbling house.

They all rise and leap from the vehicle.

EXT. TRACT HOUSE -- PHOENIX -- DAY.

WE ARE RIGHT BEHIND THE WOMAN, who mumbles the prayer as she runs. The back of her vest reads: FBI. Her name is KATE MACY.

MACY
Give us this day... our daily

bread...

They reach the door, a shotgun BLASTS THE HINGES. It falls like a drawbridge.

MACY (CONT’D)
And forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us.
 
3.


She speaks the prayer faster, desperate to finish before she has to kill anyone, or be killed herself.

MACY (CONT’D)
And lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil...

SWAT officers rush in, screaming.

Macy’s turn: She runs through the busted door-

INT. TRACT HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS.

In the hallway now. The chaos is closer. She hurries the words. So close now...

MACY (CONT’D)
For Thine is the Kingdom the power and glory forever and ever amen DOWN MOTHER FUCKER!! DOWN DOWN
DOWN!!!

Two LATINO MEN, 20’S, are slammed to the ground. Another LATINO comes from nowhere, throwing himself on an AFRICAN AMERICAN MAN wearing an FBI vest. A taser is pressed to his neck and he falls, paralyzed, backward.

Macy takes in the chaos, then pushes farther into the house, running past a bedroom with an open door.

From the corner of her eye she sees:

A MAN POINTING A SHOTGUN AT HER.

She ducks as a SHOTGUN BLAST rips 10 inches of dry wall above her.

She turns, pressing the CAMERA against the wall. We watch over her shoulder as she returns fire.

A rooster tail of shell casings are thrown over us, invading our view. Bullet after bullet pound him. The man’s knees give. He’s falling...

A round hits him in the face and he is thrown back -- blood, brain, and skull fragments explode like shrapnel on the wall behind him.

Adrenaline hits her like a fever. She gets dizzy, sits against the wall, gasping for breath. A SWAT officer rushes to her.

SWAT OFFICER
YOU HIT??
 
4.


MACY
I’m good. I’m good.

The SWAT officer looks at the hole in the drywall. Leans forward. Looks closer... What the fuck IS that??

His face now inches from the hole then jumps back like he was bitten by a snake.

SWAT OFFICER
WHAT THE FUCK??

WE SEE WHAT HE SEES:

The SKULL OF A MAN. Dry skin sunken into bones like cellophane.

Macy stands up and turns around. Looks at it. Trying to process what she’s seeing. She walks up and starts pulling at the drywall. Other officers join her. They yank and tear a six foot hole in the wall, then stand back, speechless.


Bodies are standing side by side. A lime-green dust has spilled out on the floor.

The entire house is a tomb.

CUT TO:


EXT. TRACT HOUSE -- LATER.

Macy sits on the porch. Swallows water from a bottle. Holds it down maybe ten seconds. Vomits... We see another SWAT OFFICER doing the same.

FBI AGENT REGGIE WAYNE, 30, African American, walks from the house, fighting the same urge. Sits beside her.

MACY
Can’t shake the smell. Just sits in you.

REGGIE
Yeah... Sorry I wasn’t on your six.

Got wrapped up in the front room.

Macy nods.

MACY
I saw.
 
5.


She looks out over the sea of POLICE VEHICLES on the street and spots PHOENIX HOMICIDE DETECTIVE LANCE ALVAREZ, 45, heading right for them.

LANCE
Loan you SWAT and you hand us three dozen homicides. I oughta fucking pepper spray you.

MACY
Couldn’t smell any worse.

LANCE
Ha ha. You’re not the one gotta

clean this shit up.

MACY
Yeah. Thirty families without a father’s real funny, but you keep worrying about what it does to your weekend, Lance.

LANCE
Listen you fucking	--

Reggie is on his feet in an instant and inches from Lance’s face.

REGGIE
I didn’t hear you, you say

something?

Lance swallows his anger and his pride, walks toward the house.

LANCE
Clear your people out, it’s our

crime scene now.

MACY
It’s your crime scene when I GIVE

IT TO YOU!!!

REGGIE
What are the chances they’ll put

together a case.

MACY
... None.

REGGIE
Look.
 
6.


She turns and sees: FBI REGIONAL DIRECTOR DAVE JENNINGS, 50, leather skin stretched over a square jaw that rests on broad shoulders. Beside him is DEPUTY DIRECTOR PHIL COOPER, 40, balding and thin, exactly the man you want analyzing data.

REGGIE (CONT’D)
Ever seen him at a crime scene?

MACY
No.

Jennings and Phil reach her.

JENNINGS
You okay?

MACY
I’m fine.

MACY (CONT’D)
Wanna give me the tour?

She doesn’t but she will.

INT. TRACT HOUSE -- LIVING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS.

No dry wall anywhere now: the walls have been stripped to the frame, exposing another DOZEN BODIES. CORONERS in protective suits remove them as DETECTIVES photograph the scene. The smell is atrocious.

PHIL
Looks like Sinaloa...

Jennings nods and sighs.

JENNINGS
Yeah. (To a coroner) How many

total?

CORONER
Between here and the hall we have thirty, but there’s more in the back bedroom and we haven’t looked in the attic or under the crawl space.

JENNINGS
(To Phil) Call DOJ in Washington,

let em know what we have.

Phil nods, pulls his cell and steps away.
 
7.


JENNINGS (CONT’D)
This one of the houses owned by

Manuel Diaz?

MACY
No way to connect him, but he owns it.

The smell is getting to Reggie. Doesn’t look like he’s going to make it...

MACY (CONT’D)
Go ahead and step out, it’s okay.

Don’t have to tell him twice.

Jennings walks to the wall. Studies the faces -- one in particular, tinted an ashy green from lye and months of decay

--	his mouth open wide and eyes shut so tight that his brow is a tangle of wrinkles, as though he is suffering his death for eternity.

CUT TO:

EXT. TRACT HOUSE -- BACKYARD -- CONT.

We see a GARAGE, and to it’s left A STORAGE SHED. AN OFFICER yanks boxes and garbage from it, tossing it on the driveway. He reaches the floor, which is covered with rubber matts. He pulls one up and discovers a 3’ X 3’ piece of plywood hinged to the floor and locked.

OFFICER
I NEED BOLT CUTTERS.

They are brought over and the lock is cut. The officer kneels down. Lifts the hatch a little. Looks under, flashlight in hand...

-- WE ARE UNDERNEATH THE PLYWOOD, FLASHLIGHT IN OUR EYES --

As the hatch is lifted -- TWO HOOKS with wires are visible to our left and right. As the hatch is lifted, the wires pull tighter... We see where they lead: TWO GRENADES.

INT. TRACT HOUSE -- HALLWAY -- CONT.

Jennings and Macy walk down the hall. Jennings stops at the body of the man Macy killed, then notices --

Through a screen door at the end of the hall -- officers rushing toward the shed.
 
8.


JENNINGS
PD found something.

Macy and Jennings walk outside. As the sunlight hits them, the officer open the hatch, the wires pull tight and we hear a ‘clink’.

-- THE GRENADES EXPLODE. TWO OFFICERS BLOWN TO OBLIVION --

Dust, debris, smoke, and pieces of them roll toward Jennings and Macy like a wave, swallowing them.

Our entire world is filled with a brown cloud and screams...

CUT TO:


INT. MANUEL DIAZ’S HOUSE -- DAY.

We see children splashing and playing in a large pool through enormous windows in MANUEL DIAZ’S living room. As we pull back, we hear the sounds of a NEWS REPORT.

NEWS REPORTER (V.O.)
Phoenix police have released no
details, but there HAS BEEN an
explosion at a house in South

Phoenix.

CAMERA PIVOTS and we are looking at a TV across a flawlessly decorated living room. Aerial footage of the tract house and obliterated storage plays.

NEWS REPORTER (V.O.) You can clearly see two bodies covered in tarps but Phoenix Police will not release names or even confirm the deaths. Witnesses on the scene state that a warrant was served at the house an hour BEFORE the explosion, so the speculation is the deceased are Phoenix police officers --

A MAN leans into frame. His head slowly shakes as he watches and listens. A cell phone rings. He answers it, mutes the TV, and retreats out of frame, leaving us to watch the news in silence, as the sounds of children splashing and laughing wafts in through an open window.

CUT TO:
 
9.


INT. MACY’S APARTMENT -- BATHROOM -- NIGHT.

We stare at the spout. Water washes over us. We look at the drain. Dirt, blood, and small fragments of pink, white, and navy blue circle the drain as gravity carries them to the sewers of Phoenix.

Dark brown hair is vigorously scrubbed. Macy does not relax in this shower-- that is not its purpose. The purpose is to decontaminate.

INT. BATHROOM -- MOMENTS LATER.

Macy stands in front of the mirror, brushing her hair. There are abrasions on her cheek and a deep cut that runs down from the corner of her eye-- like she cried a scar.

The hair brush catches. Pulls her head back.

MACY
OW.

She extracts the brush. Feels around on her scalp and retrieves a piece of bone. Looks at it...

She wraps it in toilet paper, sets it on the counter, and gets back in the shower. Turns it on. Gonna try this again...

INT. MACY’S LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT.

The decor is Spare. Functional and nothing more. Doesn’t even tease herself with pictures on the wall.

Macy walks in wearing a large men’s t shirt, nothing else.
Her COMPUTER CHIRPS. ROSALYN4620 is asking that she chat.

Macy looks at the screen.

MACY (CONT’D)
Not tonight mom.

Keeps walking. Her cell phone rings. Call display: MOM.

MACY (CONT’D)
Uhh... (Answers it) Mom, it was a

really tough--

ROSALYN (V.O.)
Everyone sure missed you today.

Macy’s body tenses and deflates at the same time.

MACY
Me too. You get my card?
 
10.


MOM (V.O.)
Get on the computer. I want to see you--

MACY
Mom, I just got --

MOM (V.O.)
It’s my birthday goddammit-

MACY
I’m signing on.

She hits a button on her computer and ROSALYN MACY, 60 today, appears. She leans back and forth in front of the lens, still unsure about this technology that beams her image through space.

MOM
Can you see me?

MACY
Stay in one place, Mom. Happy

birthday. Sorry I didn’t call-

MOM
Can you see me? I don’t see you.
Lean forward -- there you are...

What happened to your face?

Rosalyn’s happy mood is gone.

MACY
Nothing. It’s something on your

lens.

MOM
Kate. I can see it.

MACY
Like I said, rough day.

Silence.

MOM
What a waste of a law degree, Kate.

Macy holds her tongue, but it takes effort.

MACY
Who came to the party?
 
11.


MOM
Evan sent me a card. I thought that was very sweet. Have you two spoken?

Macy sighs.

MACY
No.

MOM
Well... I hope you two will become friends.

MACY
I’m sure we’ll be great friends,
Mother. Nothing like a divorce to

bring people closer.

Beat.

MOM
You look tired.

MACY
I am... (forces a smile) Happy
birthday. How does it feel to be

60?

MOM
It would feel a lot better with a grandchild, and I don’t think it’s unreas--

Macy slams the laptop closed. She rubs her eyes... So tired. Her cell phone rings. She flips it open, angry --

MACY
I DON’T WANT TO TALK ABOUT GRANDCHILDREN. (It isn’t mom) Yeah, umm... I can, I can be there in, say thirty minutes? Yes sir.

Hangs up. Day’s not over.

CUT TO:

INT. HOMELAND SECURITY COMMAND CENTER -- PHOENIX -- NIGHT.

Macy and Reggie sit in chairs against a glass wall. NEWS FOOTAGE of the blast plays on monitors along the wall of a command center filled with activity.
 
12.


In the glass office behind them, a dozen men in suits. Jennings, in the same shape as Macy, has deflated into a chair, Phil sitting beside him.

Macy turns and looks through the wall at the men.

REGGIE
Know what’s going on?

MACY
No idea.

Jennings makes eye contact with Macy through the glass. For the first time, he seems old to her.

All these men look important, except one: MATT GRAVES, 40, golf shirt, bit of a belly, red, shaggy hair -- looks like a tourist. His demeanor is easy, you almost get the sense he’s having fun. Macy turns around and rests her head against the glass.

MACY (CONT’D)
I need coffee.


REGGIE
We did this by the book, right?

MACY
Come on ... Of course.

Macy lets out a heavy breath, looks back through the glass to find: every man in the room is STARING RIGHT AT HER.

MACY (CONT’D)
Jesus.

REGGIE
What?(Turns around) Oh shit.

Phil walks toward them, pushes open the door.

PHIL
Would you step in here, Kate?

She rises and shares a look with Reggie. The door closes behind her.

INT. GLASS OFFICE -- CONT.

Matt smiles, friendly. A man in his 40’s, military haircut, BURNETT, looks her over.
 
13.


BURNETT
Quite a find today ... The loss of two officers not withstanding.

She says nothing.

BURNETT (CONT’D)
How familiar are you with Manuel

Diaz’s operation?

MACY
His company, Sun Valley, owns
eighty or so foreclosure

properties, another --

MATT
What do you know about his brother?

She looks at Matt.

MACY
Um ... Wasn’t aware he had one.

MATT
Guillermo... Mexican police are holding him in Juarez. What do you know about his cousin?

Beat.

MACY
Didn’t know he had one of those

either.

BURNETT
His cousin is Fausto Alarcon.

Beat.

MACY
I don’t know who that is.

MATT
Number three in the Sinaloa Cartel.

BURNETT
Manuel Diaz is likely their most senior member in the United States.

Macy feels woefully unprepared for an inquisition.

MACY
None of this is in his file.
 
14.


BURNETT
With good reason.

MATT
Loose lips sink ships, Kate.

MACY
I’m not --

JENNINGS
Agent Macy doesn’t work narcotics, she runs a kidnapping response team.

MATT
You married?

MACY
I’m sorry?

MATT
Husband?

Who the fuck is this clown in the golf shirt?

MACY
Divorced.

MATT
Kids?

MACY
No. He works for Border Patrol and got to keep the condo and my Bronco, anything else?

Matt smiles. Phil stands up.

PHIL
Thank you Kate, if you could wait

outside, please.

She stands there for a beat, utterly confused, then leaves.

She sits back down next to Reggie.

REGGIE
... Well?

MACY
I have no clue.
 
15.


We watch the men speaking through the glass, then they all file out of the office except Jennings and Matt. Phil stands at the door.

PHIL
Will you come in, Kate?

She walks in and stands across from Jennings.


JENNINGS
DOJ wants advisors that focus on cartels involved in pursuing Mr. Diaz. This is Matt Graves. He’ll be leading --

MACY
He’ll be leading who? This is

Phoenix Homicide now.

MATT
We’re expanding the scope of the

investigation.

PHIL
You’ll act as a liaison.

MACY
What does that mean?

PHIL
State Department is pulling an
agent from the field that
specializes in responding to
escalated cartel activity. You’ll
meet up with them...(To Matt) at
Luke, Tomorrow?

MATT
Day after. Early.

MACY
Luke ... Air Force base?

MATT
Gonna go see Guillermo.

MACY
His brother.

MATT
That’s the one.

Matt smiles, like they’re discussing renovating a kitchen.
 
16.


MACY
Okay... If I, umm... What’s our

objective?

MATT
Our objective is to dramatically

overreact.

Beat.

MACY
Why isn’t Reggie in here?

MATT
He’s a little green. You’ve been

kicking doors longer.

She looks back at Reggie.

MATT (CONT’D)
Makes you feel better to have him
around, he can tag along after we

get back from El Paso.

He smiles. She takes this in.

JENNINGS
Kate. You must volunteer for an
interagency task force... Think
very hard before you respond ...

You want to be a part of this?

Jennings’ eyes beg her to say no. But the hunter in her is awake. She looks back at Reggie -- his eyes are full of concern...

MACY
We get an opportunity at the men

responsible for today?

MATT
The men who are REALLY responsible.

MACY
Then yeah, sure. I’ll volunteer.

Jennings looks at her. Nods. She is theirs now...
 


CUT TO:
 
17.


INT. TINY HOUSE -- NOGALES, MEXICO -- DAY.

Morning sun hits closed eyes. Dark, fat face. Beads of sweat on his brow and cheeks. Thick mustache. His name is SILVIO.

A SHADOW falls over him. He feels it. Eyes pop open, tense.

BOY’S VOICE
Papa?

A smile crosses Silvio’s face.

BOY’S VOICE (CONT’D)
Despirtate.

SILVIO
No.

Silvio closes his eyes. The little boy taps him on the chest.

BOY’S VOICE
Si.

Silvio’s smile grows. It is a game.

SILVIO
No.

We see the boy now. He is eight. Bright brown eyes. His name is ELISEO.

SILVIO (CONT’D)
SI!! Tengo un juego de futbol!

Silvio acts surprised.

SILVIO (CONT’D)
Nooooo...

The boy laughs and grabs his father’s hand, tugging.

ELISEO
Si Papa! Tenemos que ir!

The boy pulls with all his might. Silvio makes a show of resisting, then climbs out of bed. Eliseo keeps a tight hold of his hand, and walks him down a hall to a small kitchen with adobe walls and a dirt floor. An opening leads to a small patio that now serves mostly as a chicken coop. Two chickens are in the kitchen.

A woman stands over a stove, cooking.
 
18.


ELISEO (CONT’D)
Papa necessita cafe y juevos!

Tenemos priso mama!

She turns and smiles at her son, the bright star in her black life. Her eyes pass over Silvio. She stopped loving him years ago, but he adores their little boy... At least they have that.

He sits down. She scoops eggs onto a plate with tortillas, drops it in front of him. Hands him a coffee. He sniffs it, hands it back. Without a word she pours in two fingers of tequila.

The boy stares at his father with endless joy. No idea how unlucky he is.

Silvio stares back, winks. The boy smiles.

EXT. SILVIO’S HOUSE -- DAY.

Silvio and Eliseo exit the house. Silvio wears a State Police uniform, dressed to intimidate. The boy wears his uniform, dressed to play soccer. They walk past cinder-block houses, one after the other, cracked and faded from the sun.

Tejano music, car horns, and distant yelling penetrate the morning.

Two ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIERS drive past.

Silvio and Eliseo wander away, Eliseo’s tiny hand clinging to Silvio’s police belt. Eliseo has his father for the whole day and he isn’t letting go.

They turn and disappear around the corner. Only thing on the street is a stray dog burying itself in an overturned trash can... The mascot of this dying city.

CUT TO:



EXT. BEACH -- SOUTH OF CARTAGENA -- DAY.

We are back with Alejandro, holding a man under water. Face to the sun, somehow able to focus fully on the task at hand while escaping to someplace else.

He lets the man up. Coughing, heaving up salt water, and sobbing. He looks at Alejandro with the pleading eyes of a man whose will has been broken.
 
19.


MAN
Colonel Guteman. Yes...

ALEJANDRO
And you too...

He nods.

ALEJANDRO (CONT’D)
Say it.

MAN
Of course me too! If the Americans would leave, you would see... no one is pure.

Alejandro lets the man up and pushes him toward the shore. We now see the man wears a MILITARY UNIFORM. He walks ahead of Alejandro, looking back.

The man makes a half hearted attempt at attacking Alejandro, who pushes and spins him like a defiant child.

They walk a few steps and the man tries it again. Alejandro’s appears only half committed to the sloppy assault. Alejandro slaps the man across the face, then pushes him forward, slapping the back of his head as he does.

They reach a stump where Alejandro’s linen coat rests.

ALEJANDRO
Sit down.

MAN
Why?

ALEJANDRO
Can’t walk back like this. We need to dry.

They sit back and bathe in the sun. The man is uncomfortable-kidnapper and captive, lounging on the shore. He considers running. Considers fighting him again, but settles on resting his tired back against the stump.

MAN
What will you do with me?

ALEJANDRO
Nothing.

Beat.
 
20.


MAN
Will I be arrested?

ALEJANDRO
No.

MAN
What will you do with the Colonel?

ALEJANDRO
Nothing. (Alejandro turns his face to the sun) I just wanted to know.

CUT TO:


EXT. JUNGLE PATH -- COLOMBIA -- DAY.

Alejandro and the man walk along a two track road through a field of sugar cane.

MAN
If you tell. They will kill me...

my family.

ALEJANDRO
Don’t give me a reason.

Beat.

MAN
How do I avoid that?

ALEJANDRO
By telling me the truth without

having to drown you.

They come around a bend and we see:

A COLOMBIAN MILITARY BASE.

Structures built in simple but orderly rows. Humvees, one after the other, parked neatly in front. Soldiers move about. Colombia may be corrupt, but they are orderly about it. None of the filth and chaos of northern Mexico. They have been at it much longer, with battle lines very clearly drawn.

The man turns to Alejandro.

MAN
So... that’s it then?

Alejandro nods.
 
21.


MAN (CONT’D)
You act like the Narcos. You do

things that I don’t understand.

Alejandro offers him a polite smile.

ALEJANDRO
If you are very lucky you never

will.

The man walks away, turning back occasionally to see if he is truly free.

Alejandro turns in another direction, spots THREE US MARINE HUMVEES, EIGHT MARINES BESIDE THEM. Matt stands in front. They walk toward each other.

ALEJANDRO (CONT’D)
It is the Colonel.

MATT
We’ll get to that...

Alejandro looks over the Marines.

ALEJANDRO
Why so many?

MATT
Don’t want anything to happen to

you on the way to the airport.

ALEJANDRO
Where are we going?

MATT
To keep my promise.

Alejandro’s kind, hollow eyes almost show emotion.

ALEJANDRO
What did they do?

MATT
Doesn’t matter. It leads to Fausto.

And I’m going to turn you loose.

Alejandro stands for a moment. The tiniest hint of a smile curls his lips.

ALEJANDRO
Thank you.

CUT TO:
 
22.


INT. CHEVY TAHOE -- DAY.

Reggie drives, Macy riding shotgun. Through the windshield, we see the entrance to LUKE AIR FORCE BASE approaching.

REGGIE
You’re back tonight?

MACY
Yeah. I’ll call you, let you know

what time.

REGGIE
I don’t understand why they don’t

want me there...

She deflects.

MACY
It’s El Paso... Don’t think you’re missing much.

REGGIE
Well... you keep your eye on that

doughy prick in the golf shirt...

She smiles.

MACY
I’m supposed to worry about you.

REGGIE
This isn’t what we do, Kate.

MACY
We do what we need to do.


EXT. LUKE AIR FORCE BASE -- PHOENIX --	DAY.

Reggie pulls to the guard post, hands over their ID’s. An AIR FORCE MP takes them, compares ID’s to a list.

AIRPORT MP
(To Reggie) You’re not on here.

REGGIE
I know. What’s she supposed to do?

AIRPORT MP
Walk.

Macy opens the door and steps out.
 
23.


MACY
I’ll call you when we’re heading

back.

She walks around the front of the Tahoe and disappears with the MP into the guard house.

EXT. LUKE AIR FORCE BASE -- PHOENIX -- DAY.

Macy walks toward the runways, looking around, unsure where to go.

MATT (O.S.)
Kate.

She turns, sees Matt.

MATT (CONT’D)
This way.

MACY
Am I late?

MATT
No. We just landed.

She walks to him and they head off. Alejandro sits on a bench, patiently. They walk to him.

MATT (CONT’D)
This is my bird dog, his name’s

Alejandro.

He stands.

ALEJANDRO
Hello.

MACY
Kate Macy.

Alejandro studies her.

ALEJANDRO
Have you been to Juarez before?

MACY
No... Wait, we’re going to El Paso, right?

MATT
Yeah, we’ll talk about it on the

plane.
 
24.


He walks off, they follow. He leads them to a GULFSTREAM G650.

MACY
We’re taking this?

MATT
Yeah.

MACY
Really... Okay...

They climb in.

INT GULFSTREAM G650

They strap themselves in as the pilot speaks with the tower. Macy sits beside Alejandro. Studies him. He looks like a doctor or accountant, but there is an absent manner to his actions, as though nothing warrants his full attention but the weight of his thoughts. He catches her looking at him.

ALEJANDRO
What is your experience with

operations like these?

MACY
None... What IS the operation?

He gives her a polite smile.

ALEJANDRO
Sleep if you can. Juarez will

demand all of your focus.

He lays his head back and closes his eyes. Macy looks at Matt.

MACY
Are we going into Juarez?

Shakes his head. Could be interpreted as a ‘no’.

MACY (CONT’D)
DOD flies around in Gulfstreams

now?

MATT
You guys don’t have one?

She laughs.

MACY
Right... Food on this flight?
 
25.


MATT
They got some bitchin peanuts in the back. Kind of a self-serve deal though.

He puts his head back, closes his eyes. She looks over at Alejandro who is already asleep. Macy’s wired. No chance of sleep. Pulls a magazine from the seat back as the plane begins to taxi...

CUT TO:


-- FLASH BACK --

WE SEE: Alejandro’s face in profile. Sunlight spilling over him through a small window. He looks different. Softer... Happy...

DARK BROWN HAIR lowers into frame toward him. He pushes it back, revealing a young woman. She smiles and kisses him. He lets her hair fall as the kiss grows. Dark hair fills the frame...

It gets very still. Darker now. Sunlight is gone. We PULL BACK. Farther. Farther still. See the woman’s body. She lays face down in a hallway, naked. Blood pooled beneath her.

We hear a HEART BEAT. We move down a hall. Heart beating FASTER. Past a MEXICAN POLICE OFFICER, who somberly watches us... At the end of the hall we hear something rubbing, swaying. We move faster. Heart beats faster. Racing now.

Come to the end of the hall, the SWAYING IS LOUDER. We turn left, push open a door. Look up -- The swaying sound is a ROPE. It swings in and out of frame. We follow it down -- the LIFELESS BODY OF A YOUNG GIRL at the end of it.

BACK TO PRESENT--

Alejandro jolts awake, slamming his hands into the seat in front of him -- scaring the living shit out of Macy.

MACY
JESUS!!

Alejandro looks straight ahead.

MACY (CONT’D)
You okay?

Doesn’t look at her. Sweat rolls down his face.
 
26.


ALEJANDRO
Yes.

She keeps looking at him. He turns to her.

ALEJANDRO (CONT’D)
I’m fine.

We hear the pilot announce their initial descent into El Paso’s FORT BLISS. Alejandro leans back in his seat.

MACY
So... This is your specialty.

ALEJANDRO
Hmm?

MACY
He said the cartels in Mexico are

your specialty.

ALEJANDRO
Yes.

MACY
Anything I should know?

ALEJANDRO
You are asking how a watch works. For now, only focus on knowing the time.

Alejandro lays his head back. Closes his eyes. Macy mumbles to herself.

MACY
Okay... Yoda.


EXT. FORT BLISS AIR STRIP -- EL PASO -- DAY.

Alejandro, Macy, and Matt walk off the plane, blinded by the desert sun.

A man in his late 30’s, mustache, DEA AGENT STEVE FERSING, waves from inside a BLACK CHEVY TAHOE. They walk over and climb in.

INT. CHEVY TAHOE -- CONTINUOUS.

STEVE
How you been?
 
27.


MATT
Good. Trying to get DOD to let me
look into this conspiracy to sink

Figi.

Steve chuckles.

STEVE
It’s the damn terrorists. They’re

sinking all the tropical islands.

MATT
I figure a month or two there, I

could get it worked out.

STEVE
Hear there’s a real drug problem at the Four Seasons there. You need any help looking into it...

MATT
Yeah, I’ll keep you posted... who’s going over today?

STEVE
Marshals, DEA. Pulled a team for

you.

MATT
I get all warm and fuzzy when you

say ‘team’.

STEVE
It’s a crack bunch too. Just

rotated back from Afghanistan.

MATT
Where’s everybody linking up?

STEVE
Army Intelligence Center.

Macy listens intently, trying to figure out what the hell they’re talking about. Alejandro looks out across the border. Alejandro seems different. He is somewhere else. Somewhere bad.

EXT. ARMY INTELLIGENCE CENTER -- EL PASO -- DAY.

TWENTY FOOT WALLS surround the center. A GUARD POST in front of an enormous closed gate.

The Tahoe pulls up... A guard, dressed like he is on mission in Afghanistan, steps forward.
 
28.


GUARD
ID’s all around. Hey Steve.

Even Steve hands his ID. The guard returns to the guard house with the IDs. Matt turns around and faces Macy.

MATT
Thought you were in the big time in

Phoenix... welcome to Baghdad.

The guard returns with their IDs.

GUARD
Be safe.

The gate opens and they pull in.

There must be fifty vehicles, most are unmarked SUVs, but a dozen Humvees and six ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIERS, complete with 20mm cannons. The area is alive with activity. Agents, deputies, and special forces operators are moving about.

The Tahoe parks and our team gets out. They follow Steve toward the entrance to:



INT. ARMY INTELLIGENCE BRIEFING ROOM -- CONT.

A US MARSHAL stands in front of a video screen showing the route into and out of Juarez. Twenty men seated in chairs. None wear uniforms, but all wear tactical vests, drop-leg holsters, assault rifles by there side. It sounds and looks like a military operation.

They take a seat in the back. Macy the men seated around her.

ALEJANDRO
Pay attention.

She is surprised by the directive, turns her focus to the speaker.

MARSHAL
Mexican Federal Police will meet you at the border and proceed with you to the courthouse located (Pointing on map) here. This is a high level target. The most likely spot for an attempt will be at the exchange and the border. The Marshals will enter -- Kevin, Keith, wanna stand up?
 
29.


Two men in their 50’s stand up. They look like they were teleported from another time -- starched white shirts under bullet proof vests, starched Wranglers, bone colored cowboy hats, and faces tough as boot leather. They turn to the room without smiling.

MATT
(Smiling) Man, I love Texans.

Alejandro whispers to her.

ALEJANDRO
Memorize the faces of everyone

here. Know who is with you.

MARSHAL
Marshals’ response team is in
Laredo so, our friends from Delta
have volunteered to come along and
will escort the Marshals at the

exchange.

The Marshal speaking notices Matt in the back.

MARSHAL (CONT’D)
Here’s the man of the hour. You

coming or waiting here?

MATT
Sure, we’ll take the tour. Loan me a couple of pop guns?

MARSHAL
This is turning into an All-Star
affair. Wanna another hand at the

exchange, Keith?

KEITH
(To Matt) You sober?

Matt laughs.

MATT
I will be by the time we get there.

KEITH
I got a bottle in the truck in case yer hands git to shakin.

MATT
I miss your hospitality, Keith.

Turns to Macy.
 
30.


MATT (CONT’D)
Guess we’re going sightseeing.

Macy looks very uncomfortable.

MARSHAL
Alright. So, and we’ll gear you up when we’re done, Matt -- you can be the tip of the spear and we don’t have to rob a guy from Delta... Be careful on the turn-around -- if a Federale is a shooter it will be on the turn around. Ray, your Team 1 is lead vehicle and we can divide team 2 into the carry car and the trail vehicles, that okay?

A man with a short beard and very broad shoulders nods.

MARSHAL (CONT’D)
Ray, If Delta could stand up so
everyone can see who to stand

behind if the shit hits the fan...

Everyone laughs. The Delta operators rise. Though this is a room of professionals, these men truly look like the ones you want to stand behind.

MARSHAL (CONT’D)
Most likely spot for a hit is at the border crossing on the return. State Police has agree to hold a lane for you. Heads up if they don’t... Anywhere along the way, anyone not in this room is a potential shooter. This op isn’t over until we are back here, okay? Be aware, be vigilant, and stay alert. Let’s go.

Men begin rising and readying their gear. The mood is relaxed. Matt walks to the Marshal -- they shake hands and disappear in the back.

MACY
Ever been over there?

He looks at her and offers a smile.

ALEJANDRO
I worked in Juarez.

MACY
For the DEA?
 
31.


ALEJANDRO
No.

He offers nothing further.

MACY
For who?

ALEJANDRO
Mexico. As a federal prosecutor.

MACY
You’re not American?

ALEJANDRO
No.

She tries to make sense of that.

MACY
Who do you work for now?

Alejandro smiles.

ALEJANDRO
I go where I’m sent.

MACY
Where were you sent FROM?

ALEJANDRO
Cartagena.

MACY
... Colombia?

Alejandro nods.

Matt emerges from the other room carrying two M4 carbines and a Kevlar vest. Macy sees him and marches to him.

MATT
(Handing her the vest) See if this fits.

MACY
(Pointing toward Alejandro) Is he

CIA? Are you?

MATT
Try it on.

MACY
Well?
 
32.


MATT
He’s a DOD advisor, just like me.

She doesn’t budge, holds his gaze.

MATT (CONT’D)
Pay attention to Alejandro -- he

says do something, do it.

She takes that as a ‘yes’.

MACY
I’m not authorized to --

MATT
Fine. Stay here.

She shifts her weight. Hesitates...

MATT (CONT’D)
But you don’t want to, do you?

MACY
I just wanna know what I’m getting into --

MATT
You asked to get on this train. Because you KNOW you’re not stopping anything in Phoenix. You’re just sweeping up the mess. In six months, every house you raid will be rigged with explosives... You want to find the men
responsible? This is where we
start.
