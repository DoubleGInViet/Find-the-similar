He walks off.

After a moment, she follows.

EXT. CESAR CHAVEZ BORDER HIGHWAY -- EL PASO -- DAY.

FIVE CHEVY TAHOES, sirens on the dashboard move through El Paso.

We watch from above as they cut their way through traffic...

INT. CHEVY TAHOE -- CONT.

Macy sits in the back beside Alejandro. He holds a rifle between his legs, barrel pointed down. Macy notices his right hand -- his finger rests on the button that rolls down the window.
 
33.


MACY
So how nervous should I be?

The DEA Agent riding shotgun turns back to her.

AGENT
Are you kidding?

He points out the window.

AGENT (CONT’D)
Over there? That’s the beast.

He turns back, facing front.

She looks out the window to Juarez. It is so close, you could throw a frisbee into it.



EXT. BORDER HIGHWAY -- CONTINUOUS.

THE CONVOY turns onto the BRIDGE OF THE AMERICAS. Border Agents have closed the left lane to traffic, in preparation for the convoy’s arrival.

From above, we see MEXICO. Some THIRTY FEDERAL POLICE TRUCKS, SOLDIERS FILLING THE BEDS are waiting for them.

The convoy drives straight through -- the Mexican Police trucks roll forward as our convoy catches up to them.

**THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF SCENE, WE WILL INTERCUT IN AND OUT OF THE VEHICLES**

The city of Juarez is itself a crime. Filthy and crumbling, hookers and criminals fill every possible space of sidewalk. They are as plentiful as the unfortunate masses that are condemned to live and work here.

SIRENS BLARE. POLICE YELL OVER LOUD SPEAKERS AND THROUGH MEGAPHONES FOR VEHICLES TO PULL OVER AND LET THE CONVOY PASS.

SWEAT rolls down Macy’s face. She can feel her heart
beating... Loud enough she actually wonders if others hear it too.

At every turn, it seems there are soldiers and police. A large group of police can be seen on a side-street, standing around a car -- a DEAD BODY on the street beside it.

Macy sees a woman in her 20’s SPRINTING down the street, SCREAMING, though there is no one chasing her.
 
34.


Alejandro taps her on the shoulder, motions her to scoot toward him.

ALEJANDRO
Want to see Juarez?

He points to A BRIDGE WHERE THE BODY OF A MAN HANGS, a dozen soldiers looking down at it.

As we look closer, we see he has been decapitated -- his head replaced with that of a pig, crudely sewn to his body with fishing line.

The body is naked from the waist down -- a state police shirt on his torso.

As the convoy races up the street, the bridge and it’s swinging corpse come closer.

ALEJANDRO (CONT’D)
Hard to believe, yes?

MACY
(Breathless) Yes.

ALEJANDRO
He wears the state police shirt. The pig -- Not what you think it means. All state police work for the cartels. ALL of them. That man... He tried to work for two... he got greedy.

They continue past. Into an even worse part of Juarez, if that’s possible. The vehicles come to a stop. POPPING SOUNDS can be heard. Like fireworks.

AGENT
Hear that?

He cracks his window. The sound floods in. GUNFIRE. Not ten shots, not fifty. Hundreds. It is a battle. Over the radio we hear:

VOICE
Everybody hold on. Mexicans are
adjusting our route. There’s
activity ahead we need to go

around.

We sit here, listening to the gunfight as it builds in intensity. We hear a series of explosions.
 
35.


Both agents in the front seats reposition their rifles.
Ready.

The convoy rolls again. Makes a left, drives away from the battle as though they were avoiding road construction. A few blocks and they all snake right. Macy is trying hard not to be terrified.

Suddenly, the convoy picks up speed. Moving 70mph over a road that barely qualifies as two lanes.

They race past a park. A large building can be seen on the right. The Mexican flag flies in front. Numerous Federal Police vehicles in front.

The convoy stops in front and the Delta operators are out of their vehicles, setting a perimeter. The Marshals and Matt emerge and move straight to the building, two Deltas follow.

Macy stays glued to the front door of the building. Waiting.
Alejandro shifts in his seat toward Macy.

ALEJANDRO
Nothing will happen here. If they try anything, it will be at the border. If no lane is cleared for us when we return... Be ready. Watch the cars. Look for old cars. Throw aways. Not gangster cars... Those are for the whores on
Saturday night. Did you watch the
cars we passed driving in?

She shakes her head ‘no’

ALEJANDRO (CONT’D) Watch for state police. They are all bad. We will lose the escort at the loop. You will see. That is when you worry.

Matt and the Marshals come out with a man covered in a blanket. He is placed in the backseat.

The federal Police begin turning their vehicles.

AGENT
NOW.

Suddenly, the Tahoe lurches forward -- moving between the vehicle with Matt and the Marshals -- acting as a shield. Macy looks out the window at the Federal Police trucks. She notices the agent riding shotgun has his rifle at the ready in the direction of the Federal Police.
 
36.


ALEJANDRO (O.S.)
Lean back, Kate.

She turns to find him pointing his rifle almost at her head. She leans back, and moves her hands toward her ears, ready to cover them.

MACY
Jesus.

AGENT
Okay. Go.

The Tahoe begins moving and performs a lighting fast three point turn, and just like that we are headed north.

Macy lets out an endless sigh of relief. We are driving very fast now.

Macy looks out the windshield, the hills of El Paso loom in the distance.

ALEJANDRO
On the left.

Two streets over, as buildings whip by, we see a STATE POLICE VEHICLE even with us.

It disappears as buildings fill our view, then at the next block we see it again. We hear over the radio --

VOICE
We have a spotter on the left everyone. Keep your eyes out for a strike vehicle.

The driver speaks into his radio.

DRIVER
Mexico holding a lane for us at the border?

VOICE
That’s my understanding. We’re

trying to confirm...

As we race to the border, the state police vehicle has DISAPPEARED.

We come to the loop, the last exit before being fed into the twelve lanes leading only to the border crossing...

WITH NO WAY OUT.
 
37.


At the loop, the Mexican Federal Police vehicles peel off, leaving the convoy alone. At the border, US HOMELAND SECURITY OFFICERS can be seen standing with rifles, making a very public show of force.

There is no lane cleared for them, and just like that -- they are trapped in traffic.

VOICE (CONT’D)
Everyone stay in this lane. Our
agents at the border are going to
wave everyone through and get us

over as quick as they can.

The agents at the border aren’t even checking passports, just moving cars through in the lane where the convoy is trapped, but there are fifty cars ahead of them...

Alejandro looks out his window and sees, two lanes over:

FOUR MEN in an old Buick LeSabre. They are staring straight ahead. All drenched in sweat.

Alejandro taps Macy, she scoots closer.

ALEJANDRO
You have a service weapon?

MACY
Yes.

ALEJANDRO
Get it out.

She unholsters her pistol.

ALEJANDRO (CONT’D)
Silver LeSabre. Two lanes over my

3.

AGENT
Yep.

He takes the radio.

AGENT (CONT’D)
Silver LeSabre, two lanes right, 3 o’clock.

VOICE
One lane over right, 5 o’clock.

Burgundy Expedition.
 
38.


VOICE2
Three lanes over right, 1 o’clock, green honda civic.

Macy grips her pistol.

MACY
Okay... okay...

Then Alejandro spots it.

ALEJANDRO
Gun. Buick LeSabre, 3 o’clock, gun.

The flash suppressor of an AK 47 is peeking out in the back seat. A sweaty, young gunman holds the rifle between his legs.

VOICE2
What are the rules here?

VOICE
We must be engaged to engage.

VOICE2
Can we get out of this vehicle and set a perimeter?

VOICE
Stay in your vehicle. You can do
what they do. If they get out you

can get out.

ALEJANDRO
(To Macy) watch the door handles.

The cars are beginning to move in the convoy’s lane. Another fifteen seconds and they can leave this hell behind.

VOICE
Get ready. They can see our lane
clearing. If it’s coming, it’s

coming now.

Only a few more cars and the convoy is clear. But that would mean luck is on their side and luck doesn’t live on this side of the border.

The doors to the Expedition swing open. By the time the assassins put a foot to the ground, the Delta operators are out of their cars and halfway to them, rifles raised.

Before Macy can react, she is ALONE in the Tahoe.
 
39.


Even the driver has exited... she is starting to panic.

MACY
Think... think...

She looks at her pistol, grips it tight. And goes nowhere.

MACY (CONT’D)
Okay...

The assassins are frozen, guns by their sides. A dozen Americans have weapons trained on them.

The Agent riding shotgun stands in front of the Buick, rifle pointed at the windshield. Other operators are at the flank of the Civic before their doors are even open.

But at the Expedition, men are already out, weapons in their hands.

The delta operators and Alejandro are yelling at the men in Spanish. One retreats to the safety of the back seat, but the others know the consequences of a failed hit and they aren’t in checkmate like those in the other cars...

The assassins, none over twenty years old, yell and cuss and threaten as the operators surround them in a semicircle.

The assassin that exited the drivers seat -- 2 carat diamond earrings and no shirt on his skinny chest -- screams in hateful defiance at the operators surrounding him.

He raises his weapon and ALEJANDRO AND THE OPERATORS FIRE -- He is obliterated -- They continue firing, surgically killing all the Expedition’s crew. Bullets ping through the windshield. Bullets tear the Expedition to shreds. The assassins never fire a shot.

The innocent masses stuck in the crossfire duck out of view in their vehicles. The streets are instantly empty.

The noise of the shooting echoes off the asphalt with the force of thunder.

Macy watches through the back window.

MACY (CONT’D)
WHAT THE FUCK ARE WE DOING??!!

The men watching the other vehicles hold targets in their sights. The rest will take their chances with the boss. Don’t even look in the direction of the Americans -- just stare straight ahead, sweating...
 
40.


The operators and Alejandro work their way back to the vehicle. Everyone retreats to their cars.

The kid with the AK 47 in the back of the Buick makes a move for his door handle. Alejandro clocks it, puts 10 rounds through the window, killing him and the man beside him before the door is opened.

Macy turns away in shock to find:

A MEXICAN STATE POLICE OFFICER 5 FEET FROM HER WINDOW!!!

He raises an AK 47 to his shoulder -- pointed right at her. Before she can think, her gun is raised and firing through the tinted window.

The sound is deafening. As the man falls out of view, all we can hear is the RINGING IN HER EARS.

Alejandro and the agent riding shotgun jump in and roll their windows down and sit out of them like turrets as the vehicles start up and race to the border.

They pass the guard house without stopping, Border Agents waving them onward through the finish line. More agents point weapons and scream at the Mexican State police officers who have emerged from their offices.

It is absolute madness...

Alejandro and the agent sit back in the vehicles and roll up the windows... They are back in America.

Macy struggles to get her breath. No one speaks. After a long beat...

MACY (CONT’D)
This is going to be on the front page of every newspaper in America.

AGENT
No it won’t. It won’t even make the paper in El Paso...

The convoy is safe. It races past traffic, red sirens lighting the dashboards...

EXT. ARMY INTELLIGENCE CENTER -- DAY.

The vehicles pull in and park. Agents and operators exit the vehicles and amble toward the entrance.

Macy gets out, her head spinning.
 
41.


Matt walks up to her. She holds out a hand, begging him away.

MACY
JUST... Give me a minute.

MATT
Yeah. That got a little nutty, huh?

MACY
No. No. Don’t... NO. This isn’t ...
This was a SPECIAL OP. You’re a
fucking spook. And HIM!! Who the

fuck is that??

She points at Alejandro.

He lets her vent. Burning the unused adrenaline.

MATT
Hey. I told you to stay here...

MACY
I’m not qualified for this. I’m
good at what I do, but I’m not a

soldier.

MATT
Don’t sell yourself short. Reason Reggie’s home is I know he’s not ready for this, but he’s gonna have to get ready real quick, because this is the future. Juarez is what happens when they dig in...

MACY
Don’t put me in a situation where I have to break the law to stay alive. Don’t do that to me.

Steve walks up to Matt.

STEVE
You wanna get cracking?

MATT
On that note, I think you better

stay out here.

Matt winks and walks in the building, leaving Macy alone in the motor pool.

INT INTERROGATION ROOM	DAY
 
42.


A door opens and we find GUILLERMO, 45, fat, three day stubble, and very unhappy to be here. His hands are cuffed behind his back. A DEA AGENT holds a bottle of water that Guillermo sucks like an infant.

Matt walks in.

MATT (CONT’D)
Giving him a belly full of water...

you devil.

Matt smiles, the agent smiles back.

Matt sits in the only other chair in the room.

MATT (CONT’D)
Didn’t think we’d get you here, did you?

GUILLERMO
No hablo-

MATT
I love it when they don’t hablo. Brought an old buddy of yours. Bet you ‘hablo’ to him.

The door opens and Alejandro walks in, carrying two five gallon jugs of water. It takes Guillermo a minute, then horror washes over his face.

GUILLERMO
El Medellin.

MATT
Alejandro, he remembers you.

No expression on Alejandro’s face.

The DEA Agent moves to the door.

DEA AGENT
I’m gonna step out.

He closes the door behind him. The red ‘record’ button on the camera mounted in the corner goes out. We notice a DRAIN IN THE FLOOR.

Alejandro walks toward Guillermo, stands across from him. Places a foot on his chest. Pushes... Hard... Guillermo sways back, like a chopped tree. He moves through frame in slow motion, falling out of frame.

EXT. ARMY INTELLIGENCE CENTER -- DUSK.
 
43.


Macy leans against a car. Spots a guy with a cigarette.

MACY
Hey. Got another one of those?

He gives her one. Lights it. She draws in, coughs.

MACY (CONT’D)
Been a while. Thanks.

DELTA (O.S.)
Like fireworks?

She turns and sees a Delta operator. Holding a pair of BINOLULARS.

DELTA (CONT’D)
Come here.

She follows him. They walk to the back of the motor pool to a stairway that leads to the roof of the building. He goes up. She hesitates.

DELTA (CONT’D)
Up to you.

She takes the bait. Climbs up.

They sit on the edge of the roof, facing Juarez. He begins glassing the area.

MACY
Fireworks is code for something, I assume.

DELTA
Sort of.

He glasses. She smokes, waiting for the other shoe to drop.

DELTA (CONT’D)
Here we go.

He hands her the binoculars.

DELTA (CONT’D)
Look right there.

--THROUGH THE BINOCULARS WE LOOK OVER JUAREZ--

She sees it. Muzzle flashes. Right on the street. Rifle fire glowing white against the muddy gray of Juarez at dusk. Gone as fast as it came. She looks at Delta.
 
44.


DELTA (CONT’D)
Keep looking.

She begins scanning the city. Sirens. Everywhere. She sees another muzzle flash. She looks up.

MACY
I don’t hear anything.

DELTA
Can’t. Too far away. Keep looking.

They’re everywhere.

She scans the city slowly. Sirens. More sirens. The city is lit in a throbbing red and blue.

MACY
Unbelievable.

DELTA
Madness, huh.

He bums a drag from her cigarette. They sit in silence and watch the city go to war.

CUT TO:

EXT. LUKE AIR FORCE BASE -- NIGHT.

Macy, Matt, and Alejandro walk through the parking lot. Macy is exhausted. Matt’s on his cell phone.

MATT
Can they get them all in one place? No... I’m on a clock now, I can’t wait... No, contact Bob Fiske. Have him hold all of them at the staging center.( Turns to Macy) How far is Tuscon?

MACY
From here? Little over two hours.

MATT
We’ll be there a little after 2.

Not what Macy wanted to hear.

MACY
We’re going to Tucson?

MATT
You gotta learn how to sleep on a

plane.
 
45.


Reggie leans against the Tahoe. Not very happy.

REGGIE
They let me on the base when this
peckerwood needs a ride, don’t

they?

MACY
Reggie-

MATT
(Pleasant as can be) Has nothing to do with your race. I just don’t believe you’re good enough at your job yet to be of any use. Kate’s sure fond of you, though.

REGGIE
Thanks, man. I feel much better

now.

Reggie spots Alejandro.

REGGIE (CONT’D)
Who’s that.

Macy shakes her head, doesn’t have the strength to go into it.

MACY
We’re going to Tucson.

Matt and Alejandro get in the back seat of the Tahoe. We push in on Alejandro’s emotionless face.

REGGIE (O.S.)
Now?

She nods and yawns at the same time. Reggie takes her in.

REGGIE (CONT’D)
Hey... How was it?

MACY
Bad.

REGGIE
What happened?

She moves toward the front of the car.

MACY
Now’s not the time.
 
46.


They climb in. Reggie looks over at Macy staring out the window, resting her heavy head on her fist. He looks back at Matt and Alejandro, both already asleep.

CUT TO:

EXT. ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT PROCESSING CENTER -- TUSCON -- NIGHT.

The team walks from their parked car toward an irate BOB FISKE, 40’S, walking toward them.

BOB
What’s the deal, Matt? Why you

holding up my transports?

MATT
We’ll be quick.

BOB
I have to feed these bastards when we hold em. Know how an internal auditor responds to an eight thousand dollar check to fucking Domino’s Pizza?

MATT
You’re so dramatic, Bob. This is Kate Macy with the FBI, and her partner ‘what’s his name’... It was her call.

Doesn’t introduce Alejandro and Bob doesn’t ask- Kate notices.

MACY
I don’t even know what we’re doing here. (Pointing to his cigarette) Got another one of those?

BOB
Finish it before we get inside.

He gives her one, lights her as they walk. The giant, domed warehouse growing closer. The dull murmur of four hundred people talking and sitting and moving and complaining is wafting out like an odor.

Macy tries to suck the entire cigarette in one drag. Reggie leans into her.

REGGIE
What happened in El Paso? Talk to

me.
 
47.


MACY
We weren’t in El Paso.

REGGIE
... Where were you?

MACY
We were in Mexico.

Reggie stops. Macy doesn’t. She reaches the door and flicks the smoke on the ground.

INT. IMMIGRATION WAREHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS.

The illegals have been separated by sex and criminal record.

Women on the left... The worker bees -- the busboys and landscapers and construction workers -- are in the center, and in the back, lined up against the wall, the felons...

Three dozen HOMELAND SECURITY AGENTS stand over them with M4s.

BOB
There you go. I’m starting the
buses. When you’re done with em,

send em out.

ALEJANDRO
All the women can go.

BOB
Coulda told me that on the phone,

Matt.

MATT
First I’ve heard it.


They head toward the group of felons and the like as the women are moved out to the buses.

ALEJANDRO
Watch these men close. Look for the ones like the men you saw in Juarez.

Macy looks at him. His kind, sad demeanor seems to settle her. She knows he is offering her something, just doesn’t know why. She turns to the men against the wall. They have their hands behind their backs, zip tied.

ALEJANDRO (CONT’D)
Do you see?
 
48.


She scans their faces. Many have tattoos, shaved heads. A boy, maybe 18, haircut like a pop star from the 90’s. Diamond earrings, stares hard at her.

MACY
Him.

Alejandro nods.

ALEJANDRO
Yes. Keep looking.

She studies more faces. The ones that look like American gangsters- they look down, away, no eye contact. But the ones with mustaches no longer in style, hair parted down the middle, the lanky teens with Polo shirts, they stare defiantly. No fear of consequence from American officers. As subtle as the differences are- how they wear their pants, how they lean against the wall... she understands now.

MACY
Yeah. I see it.

She turns to Alejandro, but he is gone. She turns around and he stands thirty feet back beside Matt, looking over the migrants.

Macy walks back to them.

MACY (CONT’D)
What are we looking for?

MATT
Two ways to find drug routes. You
can play cat and mouse with those
clowns, or ask these guys what

trails they avoid.

They walk toward the largest group, the simple migrants. The ones that are filthy, tired. Eager to either be sent back to Mexico or go to work.

ALEJANDRO
They see it all, and must avoid the traps set everywhere for them. We look for one who is older... one who has had enough.

Bob walks up.

BOB
You done with these behind you?
 
49.


MATT
All yours.

The Agents begin yelling and marching the smuggler group out.
Alejandro turns to Bob.

ALEJANDRO
Break them into groups of four, Let them spread out, each group as far from the other as possible.

Bob huddles his agents and begins explaining as Matt and Alejandro walk off.

We see Reggie, observing from the entrance. He’s had enough ‘not knowing’, walks to Macy.

REGGIE
What are we doing here?(Looks her
over) What were you doing in

Mexico??

MACY
I’m with you, alright. I don’t have answers.

REGGIE
Well, let’s get some then.

She looks at him.

MACY
You think I haven’t asked these questions. Think you can do better? MATT. Can we talk to you for a minute?

He starts walking toward them. They head for the open warehouse door.

EXT IMMIGRATION WAREHOUSE	CONT.

Macy and Reggie stop in the center of the parking lot. Matt catches up to them.

MATT
This feels very serious.

REGGIE
What are we looking for? There’s in the dark and then there’s the way you’re treating us. I want to know the objective, or I walk. Period.
 
50.


MATT
Then go. I didn’t ask you to be a

part of this. She did.

MACY
I walk too.

Reggie stares at Matt, who casually smiles, pacifying the children.

MATT
What would you like to know?

REGGIE
Everything.

MATT
Guillermo told us about a tunnel
east of Nogales, near Sasabe. So
now, we’re trying to find what
areas near there migrants avoid.
Because that’s where the tunnel
will be. Better?

REGGIE
Guillermo is...?

Matt laughs.

MATT
I’m going back in.

He turns.

MACY
He TOLD you where a drug tunnel

is... Just... Told you.

MATT
Guillermo didn’t have any other options. We send him back across the border and he’s a dead man. Had to give us something.

He just smiles...

MACY
Bullshit.

REGGIE
Look man, we have a boss, and you
ain’t him. Be straight. What are

you doing?
 
51.


MATT
We’re going to make enough noise that Manuel Diaz is called back to Mexico to see HIS boss.

REGGIE
And then?

MATT
And then we know where his boss is.

ALEJANDRO (O.S.)
Fausto Alarcon, Manuel’s cousin...
Manuel’s boss... He is an

executioner...

Alejandro stands beside them, but looks out over the black desert.

ALEJANDRO (CONT’D)
When people die in my country, it
is with his hand or his blessing.

To find him would be like... discovering a vaccine. Manuel will lead us to him.

His kind, hollow eyes meet Reggie’s. Alejandro manufactures a smile.

ALEJANDRO (CONT’D) Certainly, you understand the value of that.

REGGIE
Alright... We’re good. Just don’t

keep us in the dark.

ALEJANDRO
There is only dark, my friend.

Reggie studies this strange, sad man. Looks at him with something between fear and mistrust. Macy just looks tired and mad. Matt takes them both in.

MACY
What happens when you find him?

But Alejandro is already walking back to the warehouse.

MATT
It’s been a humdinger of a day. Go home. Get some rest. We’ll find a ride. See you tomorrow.
 
52.


Matt turns and walks back.

REGGIE
I just drove a hundred fucking

miles...

MACY
This is a blessing, trust me. I
want to stop and get some

cigarettes.

REGGIE
Got you smoking again... it was

that bad?

She moves to the car.

MACY
Worse.

Reggie watches Matt walk back in the warehouse, trying desperately to play catch up. Wondering why no one, his partner included, will tell him anything...

CUT TO:


INT. CHEVY TAHOE -- NIGHT.

Reggie drives down an empty interstate 19. Up ahead, he spots a TRUCK STOP.

REGGIE
Not that I think you should, but if you want cigarettes --

He looks over -- she is sound asleep. He drives past the truck stop, tail lights fading into the desert...

CUT TO:

INT. MACY’S APARTMENT -- DAY.

Macy lays in bed watching the blades of her ceiling fan in their endless revolution. She rises -- dressed in pajamas at last -- and heads to the kitchen.

She pours a cup of coffee, heads to her computer. Pulls up the CNN website, scrolls the news, nothing about a shoot-out on the border.

Goes to the El Paso newspaper website. Nothing there either.
She googles SHOOT OUT, JUAREZ... is bombarded with images.
 
53.


Her screen is flooded with photos: women naked, tortured, beaten. Breasts cut off, pinkish flesh exposed.

Bodies of men in ditches, dead in chairs, dead in cars... dead everywhere. But nothing of yesterday. The images invade her. Can’t look anymore...

She digs up a cigarette, goes to her screen door, opens it and steps out, lights her smoke.

She sees Reggie pull up and park. She yells down to him.

MACY
What’s up?

REGGIE
You’re phone’s off.

MACY
Yep.

REGGIE
We gotta go. Those spooks been

calling me all morning.

MACY
Want some coffee?

REGGIE
We gotta go.

MACY
I have to get dressed. Come up.



INT MACY’S APARTMENT	DAY

Reggie leans against the dining room table, cup of coffee in hand. Macy moves from her bathroom, slacks on and only an old, off white bra. He notices. Doesn’t hide it.

REGGIE
Gotta get you a new bra, woman.

MACY
List of things I need is almost

infinite.

REGGIE
Just saying. You gotta... some nice lacy something.

She walks in the room, buttoning the last of her shirt.
 
54.


MACY
Been so long since anyone’s seen me in a bra, except you... don’t look at me like that. No pity, thank you.

REGGIE
How was seeing Evan the other day?

MACY
...I don’t know.

REGGIE
Miss him?

MACY
Guy works eighty hours a week and

thinks I’m too focused on my job.

REGGIE
Mmhmm. And what does that tell you?

Beat.

MACY
Ask me something else.

Beat.

REGGIE
What was it like? On the border.

She turns to him. How do you describe it...

MACY
It’s broken ... The whole place.

Just ... Lost.

He absorbs that.

REGGIE
Wish you hadn’t volunteered for

this.

MACY
Me too. But... I have to know.

REGGIE
Know what?

MACY
Could it get that bad here?
 
55.


REGGIE
Well, you sure picked the mother

fuckers to show us.

MACY
Yeah...

EXT SCOTTDALE BEST WESTERN	DAY

Reggie and Macy knock on the door. It opens. Matt, dressed for golf, stands there with a slurpee.

MATT
Come on in.

They walk into the ‘suite’, the best a motel room can be. The walls are covered with TOPO MAPS of Arizona, ROAD MAPS, and GEOLOGICAL MAPS... Alejandro sits at a table with FOUR MIGRANTS from the warehouse. Worker bees.

Alejandro points to a spot on the map with a chopstick from their take out.

MIGRANT 1 (SUBTITLE)
You can’t cross there.

Points somewhere else.

MIGRANT 1 (CONT’D)
There is okay.

MIGRANT 2 (SUBTITLE) But the coyotes there are crooked. No women can cross there...

Alejandro looks at Matt.

ALEJANDRO
We should watch here.

Alejandro points to another spot, just across the border from Sasabe, Mexico.

All the migrants say ‘No!’ In unison, even laughing at the notion.

MIGRANT 1 (SUBTITLE) That is drug land. The only people that cross there are forced to. To keep the Border patrol busy.
 
56.


MIGRANT 2 (SUBTITLE) You try to cross there, they will kill you. And for a woman... a rape tree for her.

MIGRANT 1 (SUBTITLE)
That is for their tunnels. Never

cross where there is tunnels.

ALEJANDRO (SUBTITLE) You know this land? A tunnel where cars can pass?

MIGRANT 1
Oh yeah. For years, the best place to cross... right here.

He points to a depression on the TOPO MAP.

MIGRANT 1 (SUBTITLE) (CONT’D)
This arroyo? You can walk it all
the way to highway 86. There is
shade and a spring -- here. But a
tunnel is there now. Don’t go

there...

Reggie’s jaw is on the floor.

MACY
Are you getting this?

REGGIE
Yeah. I don’t believe it, but I

understand what they’re saying.

ALEJANDRO (SUBTITLE)
Can you mark the tunnel on here?

Hands him a pen.

MIGRANT 1 (SUBTITLE) Sure. It’s been a while. Three years. They made me dig for a month to cross. I snuck out one night and ran... They hide the entrance behind an old car.

MATT
Guillermo was telling the truth.

Alejandro looks at Matt.
 
57.


ALEJANDRO
This is our way across. Right
here.(Back to the migrants) Where

do you live?

MIGRANT 1 (SUBTITLE)
East of the airport.

Matt spoons the last of his slurpee. Turns to Macy.

MATT
How good is your Spanish?

MACY
Not great.

REGGIE
Mine is. How did you get all this?

Matt smiles, spooning himself slurpee.

MATT
Power of persuasion.

ALEJANDRO (SUBTITLE)
Know a Wells Fargo on Baseline?

MIGRANT 1 (SUBTITLE) No cabron. We drive to Cave Creek for the bank. There is a Wells Fargo on Baseline, but it is a narco bank. The narcos hit you as you walk to it... Only the Salvadorans use it, cuz they don’t know... the soldiers deposit narco money there. They will rob you cabron, to make up for what they skimmed. No, you have to bank up by the white cowboys, that is safest.

ALEJANDRO
(Looks at Matt) Guillermo told the truth about everything.

MATT
We’re gonna have a good day.(Points to the migrants) Let’s send these guys home.

MACY
Border patrol’s not down there.
 
58.


MATT
Think they’d tell us all this and then go back to Mexico? You get one night’s sleep and forget everything?

ALEJANDRO (SUBTITLE)
Thank you ... don’t cross again.

Not for a long time.

The migrant looks down at a small card in his hand. The others have them as well.

MIGRANT 1 (SUBTITLE)
These green cards are good?

ALEJANDRO (SUBTITLE)
Better than good, my friend.

The men get up casually and walk out, sipping their soft drinks. Matt looks at Macy.

MATT
Have friends at Phoenix SWAT?

MACY
Yeah, we use them for breeches when

HRT is busy.

MATT
They any good?

MACY
Yeah... they get a lot of practice.

He nods.

MATT
Got a new frame of reference for practice now, don’t you. Let’s give Phoenix SWAT a call, shall we?

MACY
(To Alejandro) What did you find

out?

He lays a hand on her shoulder. The intimacy of the gesture surprises her.

ALEJANDRO
We are close.

CUT TO:
 
59.


WE ARE LOOKING THROUGH A TELEPHOTO LENS.

We watch a MAN, 20’S, BAGGY JEANS, WHITE T-SHIRT, sitting on the curb, fiddling with an IPhone.

VOICE
We taking him when he makes the

grab?

MATT (O.S.)
When he comes out of the bank. We need the deposit receipt to seize the account. Let him do the assault... we hit him when he comes out.

Through the lens we see A WOMAN, 50’s, waddling up. The young man approaches her. He’s talking to her. She shakes her head. He discreetly punches her in the kidney.

She reacts, then reaches into her purse. She hands him cash, then kneels down and begins writing something on a piece a paper.

MACY (O.S.)
What is she doing?

MATT (O.S.)
Endorsing over her paycheck.

She stands and walks the other way, holding her side. The young man walks in the bank.

PULL BACK and reveal, we are:

INT. CARGO VAN -- DAY.

Matt, Reggie, Macy, Alejandro, and CORY, 35, SWAT SERGEANT.
Two other SWAT officers, and a MAN IN A SUIT.

CORY
Can we get in position?

MATT
When he walks out of the bank, we

pull beside and you take him.

The young man walks out of the bank and is moving down the street. We are moving now.

MATT (CONT’D)
Now.
 
60.


CORY
(Into a radio) Take him.

We see TWO PHOENIX PD VEHICLES round the corner. The van doors are thrown open and Cory and his guys are on the run. The young man turns but by the time he does, Cory has tackled him.

The man in the suit, Reggie, and Macy get out. Alejandro and Matt stay in the van.

CORY (CONT’D)
You have any weapons?

He’s frisking him. Finds a small bag of meth, the cell phone, and the bank receipt.

CORY (CONT’D)
Where’s uh... what’s his name.

MAN IN SUIT
Here.

He hands him the bank receipt and the man disappears inside...

Cory continues digging and finds five thousand in cash on the young man.

CORY
Little walking money, sport?

Macy takes this all in. A crime she didn’t even know existed.
She walks back to the van.

MACY
You guys coming?

Matt shakes his head ‘no’.

ALEJANDRO
Don’t go in the bank, Kate.

MACY
This is something I can actually

build a case on.

MATT
Kate --


She turns and walks in.

INT .WELLS FARGO BANK -- MOMENT LATER.
 
61.


We hold on a PRINTOUT OF ACCOUNT ACTIVITY.

Deposit. Deposit. Deposit. Deposit. Every day. The account balance around two million dollars.

MACY
These are all Manuel Diaz’s

accounts?

MAN IN SUIT
Yeah. Look here.

Macy and Reggie are leaning over him.

MAN IN SUIT (CONT’D) Cash Deposits coming in daily, the balance transferred to a money market account in 9000 dollar increments. All cash transactions 10,000 and over must be reported to Treasury --

MACY
And you can seize that.

MAN IN SUIT
Already have. I’ll go through these wire transfer numbers and freeze all these accounts as well... this is a really big bust. I don’t know why we’ve never tried this before. Who knew they just stood outside banks and robbed people, then deposited the money...

Macy and Reggie ask themselves the same question.

A WELLS FARGO MANAGER walks over some more paperwork. The man in the suit looks it over.

MAN IN SUIT (CONT’D)
Wow.

MACY
What?

MAN IN SUIT
Know what this is?

He shows her a printout.

MACY
No.
 
62.


MAN IN SUIT
It’s a bank line of credit. You make payments over what you owe and it doesn’t show as cash it shows as a negative loan balance... See that?

He points to the loan amount.

-17,453,229.26

MACY
Oh my god.

Macy walks out of the bank and straight to the van, Reggie right behind.

She looks bewildered and scared. She climbs in next to them.
