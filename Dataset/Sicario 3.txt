MACY (CONT’D)
They just seized seventeen million dollars... I need that explained to me. Guillermo Diaz told you all that in an HOUR?

MATT
We knew where his accounts were, we just didn’t know they were shaking people down in front of the fucking branch. It’s a bogus bust, though. Can’t prosecute it. No one controls who deposits money in an account. An attorney will have that money
back in a few months... but a lot
of heads will roll before then...

MACY
We can arrest Manuel for now. At

least get him off the street.

Heads off.

MATT
Don’t you dare.

She turns back to them.

ALEJANDRO
We need him to get called back to

Mexico. That’s the objective, Kate.
 
63.


MACY
That makes NO sense... We can get him off the street! RIGHT NOW. If I can tie any of these payments to--

MATT
You can’t arrest him.

Beat.

MACY
Watch me.

She marches back toward the bank.



CUT TO:


INT. FEDERAL BUILDING -- DIRECTOR JENNING’S OFFICE -- DAY.

Macy and Reggie sit across from Jennings and Phil. Bob Fiske is there as well.

JENNINGS
US Attorney won’t issue the

warrant. I can’t override--

MACY
This is ridiculous. His guys are
robbing people IN FRONT OF THE
BANK... So we find out where his
boss lives in Mexico. Big deal.
I’ve seen the Mexican police in
action and believe me --


JENNINGS
Kate... what do you want? What

would you like done here?

MACY
I would like to follow some semblance of procedure, and build a prosecutable case against --

JENNINGS
We prosecuted more felony drug cases in this region last year than in the two previous years combined. Are you feeling that on the street? You getting the ‘vibe’ that we”re winning?
 
64.


Beat.

MACY
No.

JENNINGS
Do you?

REGGIE
No... I don’t.

PHIL
Advisors like Matt come in, stir the pot, cause these criminals to react and make mistakes. That’s how we build cases against the individuals that actually make a difference in this fight. When they’re nervous, when they stop trusting their crews, when they move their money... these are all opportunities to strike... that’s the purpose of contractors like Matt.

JENNINGS
This isn’t something I dreamed up myself, Kate. I don’t have the authority to hire advisors or authorize joint agency missions. Or fly agents from air force bases, are you understanding me? These decisions are made far from here. By officials elected to office, not appointed to them... so if your fear is operating out of bounds I am telling you, you’re not. The boundary has been moved. Got it?

She does. But that doesn’t mean she likes it...

CUT TO:


INT MACY’S VEHICLE	LATE AFTERNOON

Macy and Reggie drive in silence. Nowhere in particular...
Just driving.

MACY
Where’d that guy say the safe banks were, Cave Creek?
 
65.


REGGIE
Yeah?

MACY
Ever been there?

REGGIE
Don’t even know where it is...

MACY
North of Scottsdale. Horse

country...

REGGIE
Yeah?

MACY
Big saloon there called the Buffalo Chip... Feel like a beer somewhere far away?

REGGIE
Why? There an angle here?

MACY
Yeah. Angle is me getting drunk and forgetting about today.

REGGIE
At the Buffalo Chip? Yeah... I’ll go to the Buffalo Chip. Get my two step on... Drive your drunk ass home later...

For the first time, we see her laugh.

MACY
Alright. To the Chip.

They drive North, in search of a moment’s escape.

EXT. BUFFALO CHIP SALOON -- NIGHT.

Behind the saloon is a small arena, a corral to it’s right. In the corral, a half dozen bulls. In the arena -- a young cowboy on a bull, hanging on for dear life. Country music blares through speakers from the beer garden just beyond...

About twenty people sit on bleachers watching the bull riders, Macy and Reggie among them, drinking beer from giant cups.

REGGIE
That fool’s crazy.
 
66.


MACY
These guys are pros, this is where they practice.

REGGIE
This what you do? Come here

trolling for rednecks...

Macy laughs. Reggie takes in the crowd -- lots of young blonde girls in hats and jeans two sizes too small.

REGGIE (CONT’D)
Peckerwoods got some fine-ass women

though.

MACY
Bet I start seeing you here weekly.

The next bull erupts from the chute, sending a cowboy ass over elbow...

REGGIE
I’ll say this... these folks got it figured. Music’s all..(He stamps his foot and claps) bout life just... beating em, but still happy. Can’t take that away from em.

MACY
Let’s go inside. I wanna dance.

REGGIE
Lit’s git in thar an’ boot scoot.

CUT TO:










INT. BUFFALO CHIP -- DANCE FLOOR -- NIGHT.

Macy and Reggie have infiltrated a line dance. Reggie’s interpretation is mockery, but his gun is visible, so no one’s saying shit...

Macy laughs, spins. Doesn’t know how to line dance... feels good to move anyway. She sways, clicks her heels, and acts like a woman, for just a moment...
 
67.


INT. BUFFALO CHIP -- BAR -- LATER.

Macy and Reggie sit at a long table, many beers in. They are easy together... Would be easy to make a mistake tonight and fuck up a great partnership, but they’ve walked this line many times before.

REGGIE
I think some of these girl’s are
getting drunk enough to forget

they’re racist.

MACY
Oh for God’s sake, a Black man is president. Racism is dead, and even if it wasn’t when he popped Bin Ladin he won over the hold outs.

A blonde thing is smiling at him.

REGGIE
Yeah, baby.

Reggie notices a HANDSOME COWBOY. Tall, broad shoulders...

REGGIE (CONT’D)
I know him.

MACY
Who?

REGGIE
He’s Phoenix PD.

MACY
(Spots him) Really... Invite him

over.

REGGIE
HEY! TED!

Ted turns to the sound. Seems surprised to see Reggie. Walks over. He carries what looks like a gym bag.

REGGIE (CONT’D)
What do you got there man?

TED
I rode tonight.

REGGIE
A bull? No shit?
 
68.


TED
Yeah. Were you watching?

REGGIE
For a minute, how’d you do?

TED
Tossed right out of the chute.

(Sees Macy) Hi.

She smiles a bit. Shy even...

REGGIE
Sit down, man.

TED
Let me grab you guys some beers,

what is that?

REGGIE
Anything, man.

He walks off.

MACY
Married?

REGGIE
All yours. In my basketball league.

MACY
Good guy?

REGGIE
He’s great. Sergeant in vice.

Divorced, couple kids I think...

Macy watches him as he orders. The girl beside him, much younger and pretty, is chatting him... He’s chatting back. She retreats into her shell, feeling foolish for thinking it would be that easy to meet someone... She clouds. Reggie notices.

REGGIE (CONT’D)
I’ma cock block that little blonde for you... gonna be a sacrifice...

MACY
Yeah... Thanks.

Reggie walks up to Ted and the girl, charms his way between and gabs them both. We see Macy, letting herself be hopeful...
 
69.


INT. BUFFALO CHIP -- LATER.

Reggie, the blonde, Ted, and Macy all sit together. Ted sits beside Macy -- the battle lines are drawn for the night -- she is his. He is showing them the cinch that goes around the bull’s belly.

TED
You wrap this around and then- (he grabs Macy’s arm) I’ll demonstrate.

He wraps the nylon belt around her hand once, twice, three times...

REGGIE
I know where this is going --

MACY
Don’t discourage him. Know how long it’s been since someone tied me up?

Ted and Macy share a charged look. She smiles.

TED
Don’t give me any ideas.

MACY
I’m trying very hard to give you

ideas.

The tension of it, the flirt of it, she looks ten years younger... Alive. They hold each other’s eyes, almost like a dare... He’s captivated by her.

TED
(softly) I want to take you

outside.

There it is... Macy surrenders with a smile...

MACY
Okay.

They stand like school kids.

TED
Scuse us. We’re just gonna...

REGGIE
Mmhmm.

MACY
Take a look around back.
 
70.


REGGIE
Yeah.

TED
Watch my bag.

We watch them walk off through the club.

EXT. BUFFALO CHIP SALOON -- NIGHT.

We are looking at the sheet metal outer wall of the saloon. Macy’s head comes hard into frame, Ted’s right after. They devour each other.

She tears at the snaps of his shirt, runs her hand along his chest, grabbing a handful of chest hair and pulling.

He tears frantically at her pants. Gets them unbuttoned and slips his hand inside. Her head flies back in ecstacy.

MACY
What am I -- Uhh.

With one hand she attacks his belt and pulls at the zipper of his jeans. She reaches into his jeans. His turn to moan...

INT. BUFFALO CHIP -- CONT.

Reggie has the cinch and is toying with the blonde girl.

REGGIE
See you can also... let me show

you...

She laughs at his attempt to do the wrap Ted did.

REGGIE (CONT’D)
Fuck it.( He pulls out his

handcuffs) We’ll just use these.

She loses herself in laughter.

GIRL
Okay... (she motions to Ted’s bag)

Anything else fun in there?

REGGIE
Let’s see...

Shows her Ted’s hand cuffs.

GIRL
Did you two plan this??
 
71.


He laughs, then spots something else. At the bottom of the bag, he sees it --

A computer print out of a photo from the Wells Fargo security camera... A PHOTO OF MACY.

Everything about Reggie changes.

REGGIE
Got a cell phone?

GIRL
Yeah... What?

REGGIE
Call 911. Right fucking now, call

911.

Puts his badge on the table.

REGGIE (CONT’D)
Tell them I said so. Read them the badge number.

And Reggie is gone. The girl starts dialing.

EXT. BUFFALO CHIP -- CONT.

MACY’S back is against the Sheet metal, Ted pressed against her. Bare legs wrapped around him. He thrusts deep inside her.

It is rapid, almost angry. She needs this. Release is coming, she moans freely now, she’s so close--

We see something moving toward them in a blur.

Reggie’s fist slams the side of Ted’s face. It knocks him out of frame, exposing Macy completely naked below the waist, legs spread wide against the wall.

She panics, reaching down to pull up her pants and falls over as Reggie jumps on Ted, beating him senseless.

REGGIE (CONT’D)
MOTHER FUCKER!!! MOTHER

FUUUCCCKKKERRRR!!!

Ted is helpless, curled into a fetal position, face broken and bleeding.

MACY
What are you doing???
 
72.


Sirens can be heard. Reggie has Ted cuffed now and is frisking him. Knife in his boot. Pistol in the other boot.

REGGIE
He was sent here. There’s
surveillance photos of you IN HIS
BAG!!! He works for the fucking

cartel.

She leans against the wall, still flushed and breathing heavy, so close to orgasm, now the farthest thing from it.

TED
Reggie... pull up my pants for me?

REGGIE
FUCK YOU.

TED
You got it wrong... nothing was
gonna happen... wasn’t... Didn’t

even know she--

Reggie kicks him quiet. Macy starts to do something she hasn’t done in a decade. She’s fighting it, but sex brought so much emotion with it. And now -- no release. Try though she may, she starts to cry.

Reggie goes to her and hugs her as CAVE CREEK POLICE VEHICLES pull into the parking lot, sirens blazing.

CUT TO:

EXT. BUFFALO CHIP -- NIGHT.

EVERYONE IS HERE NOW. FBI. All of them. Ted is loaded into a car.

Macy rests against a SQUAD CAR, smoking a cigarette, too exhausted to care that she looks like she just got fucked outside a bar.

Director Jennings walks up, leans against the car beside her.

JENNINGS
See what I mean? They try to react and make mistakes... you want a little --

MACY
No.
 
73.


JENNINGS
Then keep shaking the tree. Let’s

see what else falls.


Jennings stands.

JENNINGS (CONT’D)
Finding that photo and luring him

out. That was smart.

His knowing smile says: our little secret.

She nods in appreciation.

MACY
Thank you, Dave.

JENNINGS
Thank you. Unlike most of the perps we see, Phoenix PD officers facing thirty years in prison have plenty to lose. We’ll know whatever he knows very soon.

Jennings walks off. Macy pulls a long drag from the cigarette. She looks at it, and must accept the fact that she is once again a smoker...

Reggie walks up to her. He hands her a new pack. They look at each other. Try not to, but can’t help it. They laugh... But when Macy’s laughter risks turning to tears, she stops.

REGGIE
Thought all you white girls shaved.

She starts laughing again.

MACY
You saved my life.

REGGIE
Nah. Think he was meant to scare

you, or test you, maybe...

MACY
Are they following us?

REGGIE
Don’t know. They’re gonna take your vehicle, look for a transmitter. Which would mean there’s someone in our house involved too.

(MORE)
 
74.

REGGIE (CONT'D)
Maybe someone tailed us from the

bank... I don’t know.

The not knowing scares her.

MACY
Thank you. I mean it.

He accepts it with a nod.

MACY (CONT’D)
Where is he now?

REGGIE
Backseat of your car. With our

shadows.

Takes that in.

MACY
I hope they kill him.

REGGIE
You don’t mean that.

MACY
... No.

They lean against the car in silence.

INT. MACY’S VEHICLE -- CONT.

Ted sits in the backseat, face destroyed. The reality of his situation now fully in front of him. Matt sits in the front seat, Alejandro beside him.

TED
Okay. Okay. Okay...

MATT
You said that Ted.

TED
Look... I. I. I was asked what her case involved-

As quick as a cat, Alejandro stabs his thumb into Ted’s eye.
Ted pitches forward.

MATT
The beauty of you being so beat to shit... No one’s gonna notice a couple more scratches... this is a new game, Ted.
(MORE)
 
75.

MATT (CONT'D)
I’m the guy who will decide if your daughters get Federal protection or whether we post your ex wife’s address on the internet. I decide whether you go to prison at a work camp in Missouri or a kill house like Corcoran. This is where you negotiate how to survive...

TED
I’m in really fucking deep here.

ALEJANDRO
How many officers do they have on

the force?

TED
I don’t know... How do I guarantee my family’s safe?

ALEJANDRO
You want the truth?

TED
Please.

ALEJANDRO
Give the names, give the houses,
phone numbers ... Give me all of

you.

We watch from a distance as Matt and Alejandro listen. Matt stands and waves over the Director and other agents. They lean over and listen to Ted spilling.

Ted is then removed and marched toward another vehicle.
Alejandro and Matt walk toward Macy.

MATT
Good job.

She laughs at the conviction this lie is given by everyone.

MACY
I love how we’re all going to

pretend I planned this.

MATT
You write it that way in the

report. (Looking at Reggie) Yes?

REGGIE
Well ... she found the picture and led him outside.
 
76.


MATT
Real quick thinking, Kate.

MACY
Yeah ... So, can I go home tonight or ...

MATT
Sure ... This is good news. They’re going to call Manuel back. Soon.

MACY
Whoopee. Then we can call the Mexican police to go arrest their employer. Why do I think that won’t happen?

MATT
(Matt really likes this girl) Gotta have a little faith.


Matt walks off.

REGGIE
You can come stay with me.

MACY
I’ll be fine... They have your

picture too, you know.

REGGIE
Yeah. Thought crossed my mind.

Phil waves Reggie over. Macy is alone. She looks left, and Alejandro is beside her.

MACY
(Dry) I understand now, okay? They’re everywhere and I’ll never know who to trust, as evidenced by me fucking my hit man behind a bar.

ALEJANDRO
He wasn’t an assassin. He was just supposed to be your friend and hopefully find out who is showing you how to hurt them. They are looking for us, not you.

MACY
That doesn’t scare you?
 
77.


ALEJANDRO
I’ve been doing this for a long

time.


He looks out over the cactus.

ALEJANDRO (CONT’D) In Mexico, police do not investigate crimes for the government. Attorneys do. That’s what I did. I was very close to arresting someone who ... someone I shouldn’t have tried to arrest.

His mind wanders back. He remembers...

ALEJANDRO (CONT’D)
The brilliance of what they do when they mutilate a body is make people think -- Oh, that person must have done something to receive such a death. They must have been involved.

He looks at her.

ALEJANDRO (CONT’D)
They must have deserved it ... And for the family ... It soils every memory you have of that person.
They make it impossible to imagine the face you loved without seeing the initials carved into her forehead. Imagine her body without seeing her chest with -- remember her before...

He draws in a deep breath. Swallows the emotion.

ALEJANDRO (CONT’D)
Her breasts were cut off ...

Remember your child without ...

He looks off. Can’t even say it ... Won’t say it.

ALEJANDRO (CONT’D)
They kill the body, the memory,

everything.


She shivers as she digests his words. Alejandro looks up to the stars. Studies them.
 
78.


ALEJANDRO (CONT’D)
You remind me of my wife. I find it very difficult to look at you.

He steps away.

ALEJANDRO (CONT’D) Get some rest tonight. Tomorrow they will call Manuel back, and we will cut a leg from them.

He walks back toward Matt, leaving Macy staring out across the desert.

CUT TO:


INT. SILVIO’S HOUSE -- BEDROOM -- DAY.

Silvio sleeps. A shadow crosses his face. He opens an eye. Eliseo stands there holding coffee and a plate of eggs and tortillas.

SILVIO
Juevos?

ELISEO
Si papa.

SILVIO
Con jalapenos?

ELISEO
Si.

Silvio sits up. Takes the coffee, drinks. No booze in it. Thinks about sending it back, but the look on Eliseo’s face makes him reconsider. He’ll get drunk soon enough. He takes the plate and feeds.

Eliseo sits on the bed.

ELISEO (CONT’D)
Trabajando hoy?

SILVIO
En la noche.

ELISEO
Quere jugar baseball? En el parque?

The man chews. Thinks. Exaggerates his expressions.
 
79.


SILVIO
Hmmmm ... baseball.

The boy laughs.

ELISEO
BASEBALL!!! Si.

SILVIO
Okay.

The boy shoots off like a rocket. Silvio laughs. As he eats, we see the AK 47 by the bed. A bag of coke and a thousand or so dollars on the night stand.

CUT TO:


EXT. BEST WESTERN -- SCOTTSDALE -- DAY.

Macy and Reggie pull in and park next to five US GOVERNMENT SUBURBANS. They get out and walk past them.

They get to the room and knock.

INT. BEST WESTERN SUITE -- CONT.

Matt lets them in. He wears desert camo fatigues, as do most of the people in the room. There are computers linked to monitors. One displays footage of MANUEL DIAZ’S HOUSE and OFFICE. Another is footage of the DESERT. But that footage is MOVING.

MATT
We may have the tunnel, right here.


We look at the footage. Cactus and desert grass in the foreground. In the background, a ravine.

MATT (CONT’D)
We’ll know soon enough.

EXT. DESERT -- CONTINUOUS.

We look at cactus and brush along a ridge. Slowly, caterpillar slow, the brush begins moving. We can just make out an enormous telephoto lens wrapped in camouflage tape.

INT. BEST WESTERN SUITE -- CONT.

Matt points to coolers filled with Gatorade and Red Bull.
 
80.


MATT (CONT’D)
Tasty beverage?

This guy ...

MACY
What’s the plan?

MATT
(Easy smile) Going hunting.

There is a DOD AGENT wearing headphones and sitting in front of what looks like a sound board linked to a computer.

From the other room, DELTA and one of his team members walk through. Moving toward the TOPO MAP on the wall.

DELTA
Alright. Listen up. We’re waiting for visual confirmation to move, so let’s clarify the op. We will drive to this location. Proceed on foot to this ridge.

He moves to a diagram of a tunnel.

DELTA (CONT’D)
This diagram is based on other tunnels that have been mapped. This is NOT accurate, it is for reference only. We expect a small exit corridor on our side of the border. They mark the international border in the tunnel with red paint so Border Patrol doesn’t pursue past that point. Once on the Mexican side, there will be a small staging area, then another shaft will lead to the main warehouse and the road that returns to Mexico. Once we clear the mules, we don’t expect more than a dozen bandits.

DELTA looks at Matt.

DELTA (CONT’D)
Wanna discuss ROE?

MATT
We’ll save that for later.

DELTA
This is an in and out. We are
clearing and placing an agent.

(MORE)
 
81.

DELTA (CONT'D)
Once we’ve cleared the tunnel and
dropped the agent, DEA	will take

over the scene. Alright?

An operator watching a monitor speaks.

OPERATOR
This looks like confirmation.

We look at the monitor and see a large amount of brush, and behind it, an old wrecked car entangled in it.

DELTA
That looks like it. Okay, let’s gear up. Got a good drive ahead of us.

They begin breaking down gear, pulling maps from the walls.
Matt turns to an agent.

MATT
First thing, get that surveillance van operational.

OPERATOR
I need to fit your guy with a

locator.

MATT
Do it.

The agent takes off.

Macy and Reggie’s heads are spinning.

REGGIE
Those guys are Special Ops. (To

Matt) Are we going on this?

Matt turns to them.

MATT
You aren’t really dressed for it.

REGGIE
Well, you didn’t fucking tell us.

MATT
You went crying to daddy yesterday. We don’t want daddy to know everything. Loose lips sink ships, haven’t you learned that yet? Don’t worry, we got extra--
 
82.


MACY
We have tac gear in our car.

Alejandro steps into the room. Dressed in head to toe black.
Face painted as well.

MACY (CONT’D)
Jesus.

She notices Alejandro’s gear. Ear piece. Silenced HK Mark 23, tactical vest. Night vision goggles. No one else is dressed like him. The operator straps what looks to be a wrist watch on Alejandro’s arm.

REGGIE
What the fuck is he dressed for?

MATT
Relax. You guys will hang back when we get there, k?

REGGIE
Then why are we going?

MACY
Because CIA can’t operate within US borders without a domestic agency attached. Right?

At last. She gets it. He smiles.

MATT
Hey. All the drugs we find, you guys get to confiscate. Gonna be a big day.

He walks off.

MACY
That’s why we’re here. That’s the

only reason.

Reggie shakes his head.

REGGIE
Great.

He walks out.

EXT. ARIZONA DESERT -- HIGHWAY 86 -- DAY.

Five suburbans and a large cargo van drive down the desolate highway as the sun begins to set.
 
83.


INT. SILVIO’S HOUSE -- NOGALES, MEXICO -- DAY.

Silvio sits in his little courtyard, watching the chickens. He tosses a handful of feed and they scamper after it. He drinks a beer. Three empties beside him. He looks at his watch. It’s time. He gets up.

EXT. STASH HOUSE -- NOGALES -- DAY.

Three state Police Vehicles. One being loaded full of bricks of marijuana. Silvio stands beside the car, smoking.

INT. US GOVERNMENT SUBURBAN -- DAY.

Matt sits in the front seat. A Delta operator driving. Macy, Reggie, Alejandro and three Delta operators sit in the back.

Matt is on his cell.

MATT
What. What. What’s he saying?

VOICE
Um. Hold on... They called him

back. He’s on the road now.

MATT
Where.

VOICE
Turning left on Scottsdale. You got about three hours and he’ll be across.

Matt turns back to the Delta operators.

MATT
We’re gonna have to hit the tunnel the minute we get on the ground.

Matt looks at Macy and Reggie.

MATT (CONT’D)
Pretty exciting, huh?

They don’t share his enthusiasm. They just want this to be over.

INT. RANGE ROVER -- DAY.

Manuel is sweating, even though the AC blasts in his face. On the seat beside him is an overnight bag.

EXT. INTERSTATE 10 -- PHOENIX -- DAY.
 
84.


We watch Manuel’s Range Rover get on the interstate.

VOICE
He’s on I 10, travelling

southeast...

EXT. MEXICAN ROAD -- LATE AFTERNOON.

A MEXICAN STATE POLICE VEHICLE ambleS down the road, heading toward the tunnel...


INT. POLICE VEHICLE -- MEXICAN ROAD -- CONTINUOUS.

Silvio drives, marijuana bundles fill the backseat. He smokes a cigarette, he slows down, pulls off the pavement.


EXT. MEXICAN ROAD -- CONTINUOUS.

We watch from a distance as Silvio’s vehicle bounces down a dirt road, disappearing into the desert as the sun hides behind the horizon.

INT. US GOVERNMENT SUBURBAN -- NIGHT.

We pull off the highway and stop. A man in a ghillie suit stands up, walks toward them carrying a camera with an 800mm lens. Matt turns toward us.

MATT
On foot from here.

EXT. TRANSPORT VEHICLE -- CONT.

Macy steps out and sees another vehicle parked. Another half dozen men in full camo. From the back of the Suburban, six duffel bags are opened. Operators reach in and grab weapons, magazines, grenades. Generation 4 night vision goggles are passed to everyone. DELTA walks up to Reggie and Macy.

DELTA
Keep your fucking safeties on and the barrels pointed down. Stay in the back and don’t shoot anyone on my fucking team, got it?

Doesn’t wait for a reply.

REGGIE
We HAVE done this before.
 
85.


MACY
I don’t think we’ve done THIS.


They move out. We watch the world through NIGHT VISION GOGGLES.

We run a bit then kneel down. We are flagged forward. Kneel down. We leap frog this way forever.

Macy looks out over the desert. TWO COYOTES(the animals), are stopped, staring right at us. Macy makes eye contact. They begin trotting off, never breaking eye contact with Macy, as though they are begging her to follow. While she still can...

We come to a rise. Everyone lays down. DELTA whispers to Alejandro.

DELTA
Rules of engagement on this deal?

ALEJANDRO
I don’t use those. Ask Matt.

DELTA turns the other way.

DELTA
Rules of engagement?

MATT
Weapons free, my friend.

He whispers it down the line.

Reggie’s eyes scream ‘what the fuck’.

We drop into a ravine and follow it. Up ahead we see the brush and the old car that is hood first in the ground, like it was dropped from the sky. The team lines up across from it.

MATT (CONT’D)
(Into mouthpiece) Where is the

target?

VOICE
Bout twenty minutes to the border.

MATT
(To Delta)We need to boogie. And we need to do it quiet till we find the center.

Delta pulls his knife. Alejandro comes up to the front.
 
86.


MATT (CONT’D)
Good luck.

Alejandro nods. He and the Delta operators move ahead, silently. Disappear behind the old car. After a moment we follow.

We enter the tunnel. Moving fast.


INT. TUNNEL -- CONT.

We pass the body of a SMUGGLER, throat slit. We continue. A shaft banks left, we follow...

Another body lies on the ground, throat slit, though eyes wide open, bleeding out and staring up at us as we pass.

We see the operators ahead. DELTA backtracks to Matt.

DELTA
(whispers) So we’re clear, I don’t need to announce. Weapons free.

MATT
They don’t get freer buddy.

The operator moves forward, whispers to his group. They all pull out their 1911 pistols and attach silencers.

ALEJANDRO
Take the left shaft ... Make noise.

DELTA returns his pistol to it’s holster, raises his rifle.
His men follow suit.

DELTA
Don’t want us with you?

ALEJANDRO
No. Draw them to you. The one I am looking for will try and run.

The operators move into the left chamber, Alejandro moves off to the right. Matt holds Macy and Reggie up. Points to the ceiling: RED PAINT ALL THE WAY AROUND.

MATT
Cross this and it’s new rules.

She takes the dare.

MACY
Fair enough.
 
87.


Matt moves down the left shaft.

REGGIE
Fuck are we doing in here? Let’s go back.

Machine gun fire erupts. The fight has begun.

REGGIE (CONT’D)
We’re in fucking Mexico!!

MACY
THEN GO BACK.

He’ll never leave her. As he moves up the tunnel, Macy looks right, toward the shaft Alejandro took. Can’t resist.

MACY (CONT’D)
REGGIE!

He’s too far ahead to hear. She heads down Alejandro’s path anyway.

GUNFIRE ECHOES FROM EVERYWHERE.

INT. TUNNEL WAREHOUSE -- CONT.

We find SILVIO, and he is panicking, throwing the marijuana from his car to the ground. Another man runs up and helps.

SILVIO
RAPIDO RAPIDO!!!

They hear more gunfire. Screw it. Silvio’s not waiting around any longer. He gets in the driver’s seat.

BANDIT
Traiga me contigo!!!

SILVIO
No cabron!

The man opens the passenger door as Silvio starts the squad car. A bullet penetrates the bandit’s face, just under the eye. He drops as if he’s been unplugged.

Silvio ducks down, throwing the car in reverse, but a hand reaches in the window, and turns the car off. Silvio looks up and sees --

Alejandro.

HE pulls Silvio from the car. Spins him around. Pulls the pistol from Silvio’s belt. Tosses it on the ground.
 
88.


Silvio stares at Alejandro in absolute terror.

SILVIO (CONT’D)
El Medellin.

Alejandro places his pistol to Silvio’s face.

SILVIO (CONT’D)
No me mata!!

Alejandro jams his thumb in Silvio’s larynx. Silvio gasps for air. Alejandro grabs his hair, pistol to his head.

ALEJANDRO (SUBTITLE) What you do now is for your family. Whether they see tomorrow rests with you.

Tears roll down Silvio’s cheek.

ALEJANDRO (CONT’D)
You will drive me.

MACY (O.S.)
WHAT ARE YOU DOING??

Alejandro turns and sees Macy, her rifle trained on him.

ALEJANDRO
Put that down.

MACY
STEP AWAY. I mean it. Move away

from him.

He looks at her.

The automatic fire from different tunnel shafts rushes in and out like blasts of hot air.

ALEJANDRO
We are in Mexico now. You have no

jurisdiction.

MACY
We can’t be here--

Alejandro raises his pistol and fires six rounds into Macy’s chest.

She collapses to the ground, sucking for air. Alejandro walks over and grabs her rifle. Tosses it in the back of the Police car.
 
89.


ALEJANDRO
Don’t ever point a weapon at me again. Get your breath and go back to the surface.

She gasps, clasping at the Kevlar vest that saved her life. She rolls onto her stomach and struggles to stand. Reaches for her pistol. Alejandro slams her face into his knee. Tosses her pistol across the room.

ALEJANDRO (CONT’D)
Stop it Kate. Just stop. This is

what we were sent here to do.

He pulls her to her feet. Points his pistol at her.

ALEJANDRO (CONT’D)
I don’t have time. Go to the

surface. Now.

Blood pours from her shattered nose. She has lost and she knows it.

MACY
You lured Manuel to Mexico so you
could kill him. This is your cab

driver.

ALEJANDRO
I am here to kill the man with the power to summon Manuel Diaz. I am here for Fausto. But I will kill Manuel too. It’s what I do, Kate. Go. Or I will do it to you.

She stumbles back, turns around and runs.

ALEJANDRO (CONT’D) (Turning the gun on Sylvio) Get in.

Alejandro gets in the back seat of the police car.

ALEJANDRO (CONT’D)
Drive back to Mexico.

The car backs up, spins and drives the tunnel road until we are:

EXT. MEXICAN ROAD -- NIGHT.

We are in the backseat, looking through the windshield.
 
90.


ALEJANDRO (CONT’D) (Into mouthpiece) I am through, do you have my location?

VOICE
Copy. We have you. Target is east and north of you. Looks like highway 56 to 17 will intercept him if he stays on 17. Will advise. Go east on 56 off highway 2.

ALEJANDRO
(To Silvio)

Este a calle cinquinta y seis.

SYLVIO
I have a son... I... have a son.

ALEJANDRO
Having family... does that save the lives of the men you are hired to kill? Hmm?

Sylvio stares in the rearview mirror at the phantom ducked low behind him.

EXT. TUNNEL ENTRANCE -- NIGHT.

Reggie looks around, doesn’t see Macy anywhere. Spots Matt among the Delta team.

MATT
(Into mouthpiece) Is he through?

VOICE
Copy. GPS is transmitting. Audio is transmitting. Should intercept in 20.

Matt pats DELTA on the back.

MATT
This was a clean, clean fucking op my friend.

Delta points back toward the approaching Reggie.

DELTA
Except for these assholes. Like it better overseas where we don’t have baby sitters.

Reggie reaches them.
 
91.


REGGIE
You see Kate?

MATT
She’s not with you?

Beat.

REGGIE
We gotta go back.

Matt sighs.

MATT
Okay, let’s go.(Yells to the team)

We’re missing one.

Delta rolls his eyes. They approach the tunnel entrance when Macy walks out. She spots Matt and punches him for all she’s worth. He deflects it, sweeps her leg and she hits the ground. Hard.

Reggie rushes him.

REGGIE
Hey man, what the --

He is grabbed and flung to the ground by DELTA. He holds Reggie’s face to the ground with his boot. Rifle pointed at him.

DELTA
Just lay back, baby. Let it happen.

Reggie struggles for even a breath much less a response. Matt grabs Macy and pulls her back into the tunnel.

MACY
He’s an assassin. A government

assassin--

MATT
Our government doesn’t have

assassins. We farm that out.

MACY
Who is Medellin?? What is that?


MATT
Refers to a time when one group controlled every aspect of the drug trade. Providing a measure of order. That we can control.
(MORE)
 
92.

MATT (CONT'D)
And until someone figures out how
to convince 20 percent of the US
population to stop smoking and
snorting this shit, order is the
best we can hope for... Alejandro
is working to return that order.

MACY
He works for the cartels in
Colombia... He works for the

fucking competition.

MATT
He works for whoever points him
toward the people that made him,
Kate. Us, them, anyone that will

turn him loose.

He stands close to her.

MACY
Get away from me.

MATT
Take a breath and --

She pushes him hard.

MACY
Fucking kill me or get out of my

way.

He looks at her. Takes a step back.

MATT
Long walk back to Phoenix.

MACY
I’ll manage.

She walks out of the tunnel toward Reggie. DELTA removes his boot and walks away.

MACY (CONT’D)
Let’s go.

Helicopters can be heard. In the distance, sirens are approaching.

Macy and Reggie walk away from the scene.

REGGIE
What just happened?
 
93.


MACY
They woke me up. Showed me the

whole thing.

REGGIE
And?

MACY
And I quit.

They continue to walk, sirens racing toward them.

CUT TO:


INT. SILVIO’S SQUAD CAR NIGHT

Far ahead, we see TAIL LIGHTS. Silvio’s labored breathing gives rhythm to the racing vehicle. Alejandro stays low in the back seat.

ALEJANDRO
(Into mouthpiece) This is the

target ahead? Confirm.

VOICE
Copy. Black Range Rover, 60 meters ahead.

ALEJANDRO
Put on your lights. Pull the car

over.

He flips on his siren.

INT. MANUEL’S RANGE ROVER -- CONT.

He sees the siren.

MANUEL
What the fuck. Want to bribe me,

eh.

He reaches for his pistol, puts it in his lap.

INT. SILVIO’S SQUAD CAR -- CONT.

The range Rover pulls over. Us right behind it. Silvio is breathing even heavier, if that’s possible. So many ways this can go wrong...

ALEJANDRO
Use the speaker. Tell him to get

out of the car.
 
94.


Silvio grabs the radio handset, flips the switch, and his voice comes through the speaker on the roof of the car.

SILVIO
Afuera del carro!!

INT. RANGE ROVER -- CONT.

MANUEL
This mother fucker...

He sticks the pistol in his waistband. Opens the car door.
Steps out.

INT. SILVIO’S SQUAD CAR -- CONT.

We watch Manuel through the windshield. He is standing in the road.

ALEJANDRO
Tell him to raise his shirt and

turn around.

SILVIO
Levanta su camisa.

MANUEL
You know who I am? HUH??

ALEJANDRO
Tell him to do it or you will shoot him where he stands.

SILVIO
Voy a matarse cabron. Levanta tu

camisa.

Manuel does it. We see the pistol.

SILVIO (CONT’D)
Tira la pistola en la tierra.

Manuel throws his pistol in the dirt.

ALEJANDRO
Look how good you are at pretending to be a police officer. Out of the car. Now.

EXT. MEXICAN ROAD -- CONT.

Headlights blind Manuel, but he can see the car door has opened, and an image is moving toward him. He waits, for the fool who is robbing the wrong mother fucker.
 
95.


As the image reaches Manuel, something moves from behind it. Fast. An arm reaches around Manuel and two shots are fired from a silenced pistol. Now the pistol is held to the back of Manuel’s head.

ALEJANDRO (O.S.) (CONT’D)
Walk back to your car.

MANUEL
Who was he?

ALEJANDRO
A mule. Like you.

Alejandro fires a round into Manuel’s calf. He wails in pain. He fires another round into his right hand as it hits the asphalt. He screams louder.

ALEJANDRO (CONT’D)
In the leg so you don’t run. In the hand so you don’t try to fight and make me have to kill you yet.

MANUEL
You know... who .. The.. I AM A

JEFE!!!

ALEJANDRO
I know who you are, Manuel. You are no jefe, but you will drive me to one...

Alejandro kneels down, and for the first time, Manuel can see his face.

ALEJANDRO (CONT’D)
If you try anything, if you betray me, your daughters will burp the semen of twenty men with their last breath. Do you understand me?

Manuel’s eyes go wide. He nods.

ALEJANDRO (CONT’D)
Get in.

Alejandro opens the back door before letting Manuel get in the front. In an instant, Manuel is in the driver’s seat and Alejandro seated behind. The doors are closed and the Range Rover disappears down the road. We are left with Silvio, gasping, struggling, like a fish tossed thoughtlessly on the beach, as he flops helplessly on the empty road.

CUT TO:
 
96.


EXT. FAUSTO ALARCON ESTATE -- NIGHT.

We near an isolated estate. We turn off the main road to a private road that leads a mile or so onto Fausto’s hacienda.

As the large house comes into view. VEHICLES can be seen parked in front. We approach a car along the road, a man sitting on the hood.

Manuel rolls his window down.

MANUEL
Soy Manuel Diaz.

GUARD
Si, te conosco. El Jefe esta

esperando.

The rear window rolls down. A pistol comes out. A silenced round is fired into the face of the man. He falls back on the hood.

ALEJANDRO
Drive.

MANUEL
What happens when we get to the

house?

ALEJANDRO
You get out and walk toward them.

MANUEL
What will happen to me?

ALEJANDRO
What you do now is for your family.

There is no you.

MANUEL
You think you are so different?

ALEJANDRO
No. Not anymore. Now I am the same. Turn the car a bit more to the left.

The car stops. THREE MEN stand in the driveway with automatic rifles. The Range Rover is parked so the right headlight is pointed directly toward them.

Manuel opens the door and we are--

EXT. FUASTO ESTATE -- CONT.
 
97.


Manuel walks toward the men -- looking for a way out of this.

GUARD 2
Senor, buenos noches.

MANUEL
Cuidado hombres--

Alejandro takes his pistol and presses the silenced barrel to the top of manuel’s head, pulling the trigger and driving Manuel into the ground like a nail. As Manuel’s body drops, Alejandro fires on all three men -- hitting them all in the head, killing them instantly.

He walks to the front door, opens it...

INT. FAUSTO ESTATE -- CONT.

A man rounds the corner into the main foyer and without slowing down, Alejandro touches the barrel to his forehead and fires.

We can hear the sound of talking in another room. Alejandro moves to it.

INT FAUSTO’S KITCHEN/ DINING ROOM

FAUSTO, 50’s, graying hair. Big belly. Sits at the head of the table. JACINTA, 30’s trophy wife, sits beside him gulping wine. They have three CHILDREN, two girls and a boy. A woman in her 60’s cooks in the kitchen.

JACINTA
RAPIDO, MAMA!, tengo hambre!

Alejandro walks into the room, presses his foot against Jacinta’s side, and launches her out of frame, then sits next to Fausto, presses the gun to his shoulder and fires. The children scream. Mama turns, Alejandro points the gun at her.

ALEJANDRO
SIENTATE! AQUI!!

She comes around and sits as ordered.

Jacinta stands up.

FAUSTO (SUBTITLE)
He’ll kill you. Stay still.

ALEJANDRO (SUBTITLE)
Your children speak English?
 
98.


FAUSTO
No.

ALEJANDRO
Then we will spare them. I
interrupted dinner. Please...

Continue.

Fausto stares at him.

ALEJANDRO (CONT’D)
Every night, you have families
killed, and yet you dine. Tonight

should be no different.

Points the pistol at him.

ALEJANDRO (CONT’D)
Eat.

He slowly fills a fork, puts it in his mouth. Tells his children to do the same. They chew their meal and cry. Alejandro turns to the old woman.

ALEJANDRO (CONT’D)
Take the children away from here.

She rises and hurries the children out of the dining area.

ALEJANDRO (CONT’D)
(Points the gun at Jacinta) You.

Whore. Sit over there.

She sits. Alejandro turns to Fausto, notices he has stopped eating. Picks up a fork and stabs it into Fausto’s hand. Fausto screams.

ALEJANDRO (CONT’D)
You’re not finished. Eat...

Fausto forces down another bite, rests his trembling hand on the table.

ALEJANDRO (CONT’D)
I will give you a choice, Fausto, one I was not given... You may choose to die tonight or live with the shame of having the mother of your children take your place...

He looks at Fausto. Fausto stops chewing. Processes what was just said.
 
99.


ALEJANDRO (CONT’D)
Yes ... Choose.

Fausto looks at Jacinta. Her eyes say, ”Goodbye my brave love”... Never dawns on her what he’s thinking.

FAUSTO
I take shame.

She’s stunned. Tears run her heavy make up. She looks to Alejandro. No mercy there. Back to her husband.

FAUSTO (CONT’D)
I love me more. I’m sorry.

He isn’t. It wasn’t a hard decision. She turns to Alejandro.
Holds her chin high in defiance.

JACINTA
Do it. You fuck. Chinga tu madre

PUNTA CABRON ANDALE PUES!!!

Alejandro looks at Fausto.

ALEJANDRO
See why you married her. Spunk.

Alejandro looks into Fausto’s uncaring eyes.

Alejandro fires into Fausto’s belly. Touches the barrel to his arm, fires again. Fausto screams. Alejandro presses the barrel to Fausto’s throat, fires again. Fausto falls to the floor, gargling.

ALEJANDRO (CONT’D)
Watch death come for you. Watch.
The devil is near, Fausto. He is

waiting for you.

Fausto’s terrified eyes stare back at Alejandro as he gasps for air. Drowning in his own blood. There is no specific moment when death comes. He simply fades. Alejandro sits back down.

ALEJANDRO (CONT’D)
This is what they think of you. You see?

She stares at him, shaking so profusely you might think she is freezing to death.
 
100.


ALEJANDRO (CONT’D) Maybe you have enough pride that you don’t marry another one of these. Maybe you take his money and go hide and raise your children far from here. Maybe your son grows up to be a doctor. And I don’t have to come back and kill him some day.

Alejandro walks out, leaving Jacinta shivering alone at the dinner table.

CUT TO:


INT. SILVIO’S HOUSE -- BEDROOM -- DAY.

A shadow falls over an empty bed. Eliseo stands there... this has never happened before. He walks down the hall to the kitchen. His mother is in the same place, cooking. But the look in her eyes is anger. She knows he is dead. And may God damn him for making her be the one to tell their son.

He stands there. Staring at his mother.

ELISEO
Mama?

CUT TO:

EXT. MACY’S APARTMENT -- BALCONY -- DAY.

Dressed in jeans and a t-shirt, she sits on the balcony, takes a drag of her cigarette. Looks at it.

MACY
Three days ago I hadn’t had you in ten years... fucker.

She leans back and looks out over Phoenix as the sun sets.
She exhales ... looks at the cigarette.

MACY (CONT’D)
(Half joking) You’re the only one

who understands me.

ALEJANDRO (O.S.)
I think maybe, it will be the thing that kills us all ... as a people, you know?

Macy leaps up as if she’s on fire, falls over her chair, comes up with her pistol. He moves so fast there is no time to react.
 
101.


In an instant, he has the gun and removes the magazine, disassembles the slide, and tosses the pieces on the table. She screams and rushes him. He spins her and pushes her back.

ALEJANDRO (CONT’D)
Stop it.

He moves to her and gently touches her face, looking at the gash on her nose. She is frozen in fear.

ALEJANDRO (CONT’D)
That will scar. I’m sorry.

She breathes heavy, trying to remain calm.

He begins lifting her shirt. She struggles and he grabs her throat. She looks into his eyes and it is a killer looking back.

MACY
Please.

ALEJANDRO
Let me look ... Move your hand.

She surrenders, turns her head to the side. He lifts her shirt above her bare breasts. Six large, red welts...

ALEJANDRO (CONT’D)
These ribs are bruised, but not

broken, yes?

She nods as her lip quivers. Clinging desperately to her dignity. She has never felt so powerless, and that is his point.

He drops her shirt and steps back. She crosses her arms, feeling very weak.


Alejandro sits across from her.

ALEJANDRO (CONT’D)
I would recommend not standing on

balconies for a little while.

She doesn’t move.

MACY
You’re an assassin.

Beat.
 
102.


ALEJANDRO
In Mexico, the killers are called Sicarios... The word comes from the zealots of Jerusalem. Killers who hunted the Romans that invaded their homeland... They don’t deserve the term.

MACY
You are a Sicario.

ALEJANDRO
Policing them does nothing. They must be killed. Wherever they are found. They will make every place they touch Juarez. Now ... Now you understand how far we have fallen.

He studies her-- arms crossed, legs close together.

ALEJANDRO (CONT’D) You look like a girl when you’re scared. Such beauty in you when you let yourself be frail. Like the daughter they took from me ... This is not the work for you. Look at yourself, Kate. What it has done to you in just three days ... Find a little town far from the border. A place where the rule of law still exists. You will spot predators there very easy now... Make a difference you can see everyday. Because you will not survive here. You are not a wolf. This is the land of wolves now.

He looks at her. Smiles sadly and leaves.

She waits. Starts to cry, fights it back. Begins frantically reassembling the pistol. Rams the magazine in and racks a round. Comes around the corner. Enters the house. Looks around. Checks every room, panting, shaking. He is gone. She stands there and sobs...

CUT TO:


EXT. NOGALES STREET -- DAY.

The mother walks with Eliseo, dressed for soccer. Down the empty street. Sirens in the distance.
 
103.


ALEJANDRO (V.O.)
We like to think if we cut the head from the snake, the serpent will die...

They round the corner. We follow them to a park. Weeds cut short to look like grass. Little boys dressed in uniforms, parents sitting in lawn chairs. A referee. Just people, desperately trying to enjoy the life they have been given.

ALEJANDRO (V.O.)
But there is no snake. They are worms. When you cut the head, a new one grows. From both segments ... We cannot question if the end
justifies the means because there
is no end to consider...

Eliseo runs to join his team. Whatever his mother told him, it wasn’t the truth.

ALEJANDRO (V.O.)
This is the price of our self
indulgence. Our weakness ... Our
appetite. They are our demons, our

creation.

The mother sits on the ground, watching the boys. Running. Playing. Being children. The referee blows a whistle. The boys assume their positions on the field. The forwards line up, facing each other. Eliseo is dead center, the team’s star. The referee sets the ball in place...

-- GUNFIRE RIPS THROUGH THE MORNING.

Everyone stops and stares in the direction of the gunfire. It is very still. People frozen like deer in a field -- weighing the risk. No more shooting. The morning is quiet again.

ALEJANDRO
There is a moment in each person’s life. A choice. Do what feels good... Do what is good. Make the wrong choice enough, and it is not presented again... then all choices are bad. And the consequences worse. There is no war on drugs. Only war. The enemy we fight? Ourselves ...


The referee blows the whistle and sets the ball down. The game begins.
 
104.


Eliseo swipes it and kicks it out of frame, the other boys chasing him...



THE END.
