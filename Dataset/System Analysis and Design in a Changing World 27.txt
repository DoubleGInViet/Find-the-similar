stakeholders, executive stakeholders, or both; nor is it known exactly how those 
stakeholders will interact with the system. Ensuring adequate input from this 
new group of stakeholders begins with defining precisely who they are.
RMO is a privately held company; John and Liz Blankens are the owners, 
and they hold two senior management positions. This is significant because the 
key operational systems of any publicly traded company “inherit” many external stakeholders due to the flow of information from those systems to the organization’s financial reports. RMO is audited by an external accounting firm, 
primarily to ensure access to bank loans and other private financing.
As owners and senior managers, John and Liz are the primary clients, but so 
are other senior executives who form a collaborative decision-making body. In 
addition, existing technical and support staff are key stakeholders. Figure 2-5 summarizes the internal managerial stakeholders in the form of an organization chart.

50 PART 2 ■ Systems Analysis Activities
■ Information-Gathering Techniques
There are many ways that information about the system requirements can be 
collected. RMO often uses these standard information-gathering techniques:
■ Interviewing users and other stakeholders
■ Distributing and collecting questionnaires
■ Reviewing inputs, outputs, and documentation
■ Observing and documenting business procedures
■ Researching vendor solutions
■ Collecting active user comments and suggestions
All these methods have proven to be effective, although some are more efficient than others. In most cases, analysts combine methods to increase their effectiveness and efficiency and to provide a comprehensive fact-finding approach.
■ Interview Users and Other Stakeholders
Interviewing users and other stakeholders is an effective way to understand 
business functions and business rules. Unfortunately, it is also the most timeconsuming and resource-expensive option. In this method, systems analysts do 
the following:
■ Prepare detailed questions
■ Meet with individuals or groups of users
■ Obtain and discuss answers to the questions
■ Document the answers
■ Follow up as needed in future meetings or interviews
Obviously, this process may take some time, so it usually requires multiple 
sessions with each of the users or user groups.
❚ Question Themes
Whether in informal meetings, formal interviews, or as part of a questionnaire 
or survey, analysts ask questions. But which questions should analysts ask? 
Figure 2-6 shows three major themes that guide the analysts when they are asking questions to define system requirements; it also shows sample questions that 
arise from those themes.
What Are the Business Processes? The analyst must obtain a comprehensive list 
of all the business processes. In most cases, the users provide answers in terms 
of the current system, so the analyst must carefully discern which of those functions are fundamental and which may possibly be eliminated with an improved 
system. For example, salesclerks might indicate that the first task they perform 
when a customer places an order is to check the customer’s credit history. In the 
new system, salesclerks might never need to perform that function; the system 
might perform the check automatically. The function remains a system requirement, but the method of carrying out the function and its timing is changed.
Theme Questions to users 
What are the business operations and processes? What do you do?
What information is needed to perform those
operations?
How should those operations be performed? How do you do it?
What steps do you follow?
How could they be done differently?
What information do you use?
What inputs do you use?
What outputs do you produce?

CHAPTER 2 ■ Investigating System Requirements 51
How Are the Business Processes Performed? Determining how business processes are performed begins with the current system but gradually moves to the 
new system. The goal is to define how the new system should support the function rather than how it supports it now. The analyst must be able to help the 
user visualize new and more efficient approaches to performing the business 
processes made possible by new technology or processes.
What Information Is Required? Some information inputs are formal; others are 
informal. When questioning the user, the analyst should specifically ask about 
exceptions or unusual situations in order to identify additional (nonroutine) information requirements. In this theme and the previous one, detail is the watchword. An analyst must understand the nitty-gritty detail to develop a correct 
solution.
❚ Question Types
Questions can be roughly divided into two types:
■ open-ended questions—such as “How do you do this function?”—
encourage discussion and explanation.
■ closed-ended questions—such as “How many forms a day do you 
process?”—are used to get specific facts.
Generally, open-ended questions help to start a discussion and enable a large 
number of requirements to be uncovered fairly quickly. Note that all the questions in the previous section are open ended. A discussion that starts with openended questions usually shifts gradually to closed-ended questions that elicit or 
confirm specific details of a business process.
❚ Focus of Questions—Current System or New?
A significant question that faces all analysts is how much effort to expend studying and documenting the existing system (if one exists). Excess attention to an 
existing system can consume considerable time and can result in simply updating that system with newer technology. As a result, no matter how inefficient 
the current system is, system developers simply reimplement the procedures that 
are already in place. On the other hand, if a new system inherits many or all of 
the requirements of an existing system, then an analyst risks missing important 
requirements through insufficient study of the existing system.
To minimize both risks, analysts must balance the review of current business functions with discovery of new system requirements. It is still critical to 
have a complete, correct set of system requirements, but in today’s fast-paced 
world, there is no time or money to review all the old systems and document all 
the inefficient procedures. In fact, in today’s development environment, one of 
the most valuable capabilities that a good system developer can bring is a new 
perspective to the problem.
❚ Interview Preparation, Conduct, and Follow-Up
Figure 2-7 is a sample checklist that summarizes the major points to be covered; 
it is useful in preparing for, conducting, and following up an interview.
Preparing for the Interview Every successful interview requires preparation. 
The first and most important step in preparing for an interview is to establish 
its objective. In other words, you must determine what you want to accomplish 
with this interview. Write down the objective so it is firmly established in your 
mind. The second step is to determine which stakeholders should be interviewed. 
A small number of interviewees is generally best when the objective is narrow or 
of a fact-finding nature. Larger groups are better if the objective is more open 
ended, such as when generating and evaluating new ideas. However, it can be 
open-ended questions questions that 
encourage discussion or explanation
closed-ended questions questions that 
elicit specific facts

52 PART 2 ■ Systems Analysis Activities
difficult to manage a large group meeting well enough to ensure high-quality input from all participants. If possible, have at least two analysts involved in every 
interview, and have them compare notes afterward to ensure accuracy.
The next step is to prepare detailed questions to be used in the interview. 
Write down a list of specific questions, and prepare notes based on the forms or 
reports received earlier. Usually, you should prepare a list of questions that are 
consistent with the objective of the interview. Open-ended questions and closedended questions are both appropriate. Generally, open-ended questions help get 
the discussion started and encourage the user to explain all the details of the 
business process and the rules.
The last step is to make the final interview arrangements and then communicate those arrangements to all participants. A specific time and location 
should be established. If possible, a quiet location should be chosen to avoid 
interruptions. Each participant should know the objective of the meeting and, 
when appropriate, should have a chance to preview the questions or materials to 
be used. Interviews consume a substantial amount of time, and they can be made 
more efficient if each participant knows beforehand what is to be accomplished.
Conducting the Interview The usual rules of workplace meetings apply during stakeholder interviews: Plan ahead, arrive early, and ensure that the room 
is prepared and that needed resources are available. Limit the time of the interview for the benefit of the analyst(s) and stakeholder(s); stakeholders have 
other responsibilities, and the analysts can absorb only so much information at 
one time. It is better to have several shorter interviews than one long interview. 
A series of interviews provides an opportunity to absorb the material and then 
return for clarification later if needed.
Look for exception and error conditions. Look for opportunities to ask 
“what if” questions. “What if it doesn’t arrive? What if the signature is missing? What if the balance is incorrect? What if two orders are exactly the same?” 
The essence of good systems analysis is understanding all the “what ifs.” Make 
a conscious effort to identify all the exception conditions and then ask about 
them. More than any other skill, the ability to think of the exceptions will 
help you discover the detailed business rules. It is a hard skill to teach from a

textbook; experience will hone this skill. You will teach yourself this skill by 
conscientiously practicing it.
Probe for details. In addition to looking for exception conditions, the analyst must probe to ensure a complete understanding of all procedures and rules. 
One of the most difficult skills to learn as a new systems analyst is how to get 
enough details. Frequently, it is easy to get a general overview of how a process works; but do not be afraid to ask detailed questions until you thoroughly 
understand how the process works and what information is used. You cannot do 
effective systems analysis by glossing over the details.
Take careful notes. It is a good idea to take handwritten notes. Usually, 
tape recorders make users nervous. However, taking notes signals that you think 
the information you are obtaining is important, and the user is complimented. 
If two analysts conduct each interview, they can compare notes later. Identify 
and document in your notes any unanswered questions or outstanding issues 
that were not resolved. A good set of notes provides the basis for building the 
analysis models and for establishing a basis for the next interview session.
Figure 2-8 is a sample agenda for an interview session. Obviously, you do 
not need to conform exactly to a particular agenda. However, as with the interview checklist shown in Figure 2-7, this figure will help prod your memory on 
issues and items that should be discussed in an interview. Make a copy and use 
it. As you develop your own style, you can modify the checklist to the way you 
like to work.

54 PART 2 ■ Systems Analysis Activities
Following up the Interview Follow-up is an important part of each interview. 
The first task is to absorb, understand, and document the information that was 
obtained. Generally, analysts document the details of the interview by constructing models of the business processes and writing textual descriptions of 
nonfunctional requirements. These tasks should be completed as soon after the 
interview as possible and the results distributed to the interview participants for 
validation. If the modeling methods are complex or unfamiliar to the users, the 
analyst should schedule follow-up meetings to explain and verify the models, as 
described in the last section of this chapter.
During the interview, you probably asked some “what if” questions that 
the users could not answer. They are usually policy questions raised by the new 
system that management has not considered before. It is extremely important 
that these questions not get lost or forgotten. Figure 2-9 shows a sample table 
for tracking outstanding or unresolved issues for RMO. The table includes questions posed by users or analysts and responsibilities assigned for resolving the 
issues. If several teams are working, a combined list can be maintained. Other 
columns that might be added to the list are an explanation of the problem’s resolution and the date resolved.
Finally, make a list of new questions based on areas that need further elaboration or that are missing information. This list will prepare you for the next 
interview.
■ Distribute and Collect Questionnaires
Questionnaires enable analysts to collect information from a large number of 
stakeholders. Even if the stakeholders are widely distributed geographically, they 
can still help define requirements through questionnaires. Questionnaires are 
often used to obtain preliminary insight into stakeholder information needs, 
which helps to determine areas that need further research using other methods.
Figure 2-10 is a sample questionnaire showing three types of questions. 
The first part has closed-ended questions to determine quantitative information. 
The second part consists of opinion questions in which respondents are asked 
whether they agree or disagree with the statement. Both types of questions are 
useful for tabulating and determining quantitative averages. The third part 
requests an explanation of a procedure or problem. Questions such as these are 
good as a preliminary investigation to help direct further fact-finding activities.
Questionnaires are not well suited to helping you learn about processes, 
workflows, or techniques. Open-ended questions such as “How do you do 
this process?” are best answered by using interviews or observation. Although 
a questionnaire can contain a very limited number of open-ended questions, 
stakeholders frequently do not return questionnaires that contain many openended questions.

CHAPTER 2 ■ Investigating System Requirements 55
■ Review Inputs, Outputs, and Procedures
There are two sources of information about inputs, outputs, and procedures. 
One source is external to the organization—industry-wide professional organizations and other companies. It may not be easy to obtain information from 
other companies, but they are a potential source of important information. 
Sometimes, industry journals and magazines report the findings of “best practices” studies. The project team would be negligent in its duties if its members 
were not familiar with best practice information.
The second source of inputs, outputs, and procedures includes existing business documents and procedure descriptions within the organization. Reviewing 
RMO Questionnaire
This questionnaire is being sent to all telephone-order sales personnel. As you know, RMO is developing a new
customer support system for order taking and customer service.
The purpose of this questionnaire is to obtain preliminary information to assist in defining the requirements for
the new system. Follow-up discussions will be held to permit everybody to elaborate on the system requirements.
Part I. Answer these questions based on a typical four-hour shift.
1. How many phone calls do you receive?_______________________________________________________
2. How many phone calls are necessary to place an order for a product?_______________________________
3. How many phone calls are for information about RMO products, that is, questions only?_________________
4. Estimate how many times during a shift customers request items that are out of stock.__________________
5. Of those out-of-stock requests, what percentage of the time does the customer desire to put the item
 on back order?______________%
6. How many times does a customer try to order from an expired catalog?______________________________
7. How many times does a customer cancel an order in the middle of the conversation?___________________
8. How many times does an order get denied due to bad credit?______________________________________
Part II. Circle the appropriate number on the scale from 1 to 7 based on how strongly you
agree or disagree with the statement.
Question Strongly Agree Strongly Disagree

56 PART 2 ■ Systems Analysis Activities
internal documents and procedures serves two purposes. First, it is a good way 
to get a preliminary understanding of the processes. Second, existing inputs, 
outputs, and documents can serve as visual aids for the interview and as the 
working documents for discussion (see Figure 2-11). Discussion can focus on a 
specific input or output, its objective, its distribution, and its information content. The discussion should also include specific business events that initiate 
the use of an input or generation of an output. Several different business events 
might require the same form, and specific information about the event and the 
business process is critical. It is always helpful to have screens and forms that 
have been filled out with real information to ensure that the analyst obtains a 
correct understanding of the data content.
Reviewing the documentation of existing procedures helps identify business rules that may not come up in the interviews. Analyzing formal procedure 
documentation also helps reveal discrepancies and redundancies in the business 
processes. However, procedure documents frequently are not kept up to date, 
and they commonly include errors. To ensure that the assumptions and business 
rules that derive from the existing documentation are correct, analysts should 
review them with the users.
■ Observe and Document Business Processes
Firsthand experience is invaluable to understand exactly what occurs within 
business processes. More than any other activity, observing a business process in 
action will help you understand the business functions. However, while observing existing processes, you must also be able to visualize the new system’s associated business processes. That is, as you observe the current business processes 
to understand the fundamental business needs, you should never forget that the 
processes could and often should change to be made more efficient. Do not get 
locked into believing there is only one way of performing the process.

CHAPTER 2 ■ Investigating System Requirements 57
You can observe a business process in many ways, ranging from a quick 
walk-through of an office or plant to doing the work yourself. A quick walkthrough gives a general understanding of the layout of the office, the need 
for and use of computer equipment, and the general workflow. Spending several hours observing users at their jobs helps you understand the details of 
using the computer system and carrying out business functions. Being trained 
as a user and actually doing the job enables you to discover the difficulties of 
learning new procedures, the importance of a system that is easy to use, and 
the stumbling blocks and bottlenecks of existing procedures and information 
sources.
It is not necessary to observe all processes at the same level of detail. A quick 
walk-through may be sufficient for one process, whereas a process that is critical 
or more difficult to understand might require an extended observation period. 
If you remember that the objective is a complete understanding of the business 
processes and rules, you can assess where to spend your time to gain that understanding. As with interviewing, it is usually better if two analysts combine their 
efforts in observing procedures.
Observation often makes the users nervous, so you need to be as unobtrusive 
as possible. You can put users at ease in several ways, such as by working alongside a user or observing several users at once. Common sense and sensitivity to 
the needs and feelings of the users will usually result in a positive experience.
■ Research Vendor Solutions
Many of the problems and opportunities that companies want to address with 
new information systems have already been solved by other companies. In addition, consulting firms often have experience with the same problems, and software firms may have packaged solutions for a particular business need. Taking 
advantage of existing knowledge or solutions can avoid costly mistakes and save 
time and money.
There are three positive contributions and one danger in exploring existing 
solutions. First, researching existing solutions will frequently help users generate 
new ideas for how to better perform their business functions. Seeing how someone else solved a problem and applying that idea to the culture and structure of 
the existing organization will often provide viable alternative solutions for business needs.
Second, some of these solutions are excellent and state of the art. Without 
including this research, the development team may create a system that is obsolete even before it is designed. Companies need solutions that not only solve 
basic business problems, but that are up to date with competitive practices.
Third, it is often cheaper and less risky to buy a solution rather than to build 
it. If the solution meets the needs of the company and can be purchased, then 
that is usually a safer, quicker, and less-expensive route.
The danger in exploring existing solutions is that the users and even the 
systems analysts may want to buy one of the alternatives immediately. But if 
a solution, such as a packaged software system, is purchased too early in the 
process, the company’s needs may not be thoroughly investigated. Too many 
companies have purchased systems only to find out later that they only support 
half the functions that were needed. Do not rush into a purchase decision until 
requirements are fully defined and all viable alternatives have been thoroughly 
investigated.
■ Collect Active User Comments and Suggestions
As discussed in Chapter 1 and earlier in this chapter, system development normally proceeds with analysis, design, and other activities spread across multiple iterations. Portions of the system are constructed and tested during each

58 PART 2 ■ Systems Analysis Activities
iteration. Users and other stakeholders perform the initial testing of system 
functions during the iteration in which those functions are implemented. They 
also test and use those same functions during later iterations.
User feedback from initial and later testing is a valuable source of requirements information. Yet, interviews, discussions, and model reviews are an 
imperfect way of eliciting complete and accurate requirements. The phrase “I’ll 
know it when I see it” applies well to requirements definition. Users often cannot completely or accurately state their requirements until they can interact with 
a live system that implements those requirements. Based on those interactions, 
users can develop concrete suggestions for improvement and identify missing or 
poorly implemented requirements.
■ Models and Modeling
Modeling is an important part of systems analysis and design. You saw many 
different models in Chapter 1 for the Tradeshow System. Analysts build models to describe system requirements and use those models to communicate with 
users and designers. By developing a model and reviewing it with a user, an analyst demonstrates an understanding of the user’s requirements. If the user spots 
errors or omissions, they are incorporated into the model before it becomes the 
basis for subsequent design and implementation activities. Figure 2-12 summarizes the key reasons for building and using models.
Designers construct high-level and detailed models to describe system 
components and their interactions. Design models serve as a scratch pad for 
evaluating design alternatives and as a way to communicate the final design to 
programmers, vendors, and others who will build, acquire, and assemble components to create the final system. In general, models built during one SDLC 
activity are “consumed” during other activities.
A model is a representation or abstraction of some aspect of the system 
being built. There are dozens of different models that an analyst or designer 
might develop and use (see Figure 2-13). Although this book emphasizes models and techniques for creating models, it is important to remember that system 
projects vary in the number of models required and in their formality. Smaller, 
simpler system projects will not need models showing every system detail, particularly when the project team has experience with the type of system being 
built. Sometimes, the key models are created informally in a few hours. Although 
models are often created by using specialized software tools, useful and important models are sometimes drawn quickly over lunch on a paper napkin or in 
an airport waiting room on the back of an envelope! As with any development 
activity, an iterative approach is used for creating models. The first draft of a 
model has some, but not all details worked out. The next iteration might fill in 
more details or correct previous misconceptions.

CHAPTER 2 ■ Investigating System Requirements 59
Analysis and design models can be grouped into three generic types:
■ Textual models. Analysts use such textual models as memos, reports, 
narratives, and lists to describe requirements that are detailed and are difficult to represent in other ways. The event list and use case descriptions (see 
icons shown in Figure 2-13) are two examples of textual models. Narrative 
description is often the best way to initially record information gathered 
verbally from stakeholders, such as during an interview.
■ Graphical models. Graphical models make it easier to understand complex relationships that are difficult to follow when described as a list or 
narrative. Recall the old saying that a picture is worth a thousand words. 
In system development, a carefully constructed graphical model might be 
worth a million words! Some graphical models actually look similar to a 
real-world part of the system, such as a screen design or a report layout 
design. However, the graphical models developed during analysis activities 
typically represent more abstract things, such as external agents, processes, 
data, objects, messages, and connections.
■ Mathematical models. Mathematical models are one or more formulas 
that describe technical aspects of a system. Analysts often use mathematical models to represent functional requirements for scientific and engineering applications and occasionally use them to describe business system 
requirements in areas such as accounting and inventory control. Analysts 
and designers use mathematical models to describe nonfunctional requirements and operational parameters such as network throughput or database 
query response time.
Many graphical models used in system development are drawn according to the notation specified by the Unified Modeling Language (UML). In 
Figure 2-13, the use case diagram, class diagram, activity diagram, sequence 
diagram, communication diagram, and state machine diagram are UML graphical models. UML is the standard set of model constructs and notations defined 
by the Object Management Group (OMG), a standards organization for system development. By using UML, analysts and end users are able to depict and

60 PART 2 ■ Systems Analysis Activities
understand a variety of specific diagrams used in a system development project. 
Prior to UML, there was no standard, so diagrams could be confusing, and they 
varied from company to company (and from book to book).
In later chapters, you will learn how to develop many of these analysis and 
design models. The first UML diagram covered in detail is the activity diagram.
■ Documenting Workflows with Activity Diagrams
As you gather information about business processes, you will need to document 
your results as a workflow. A workflow is the sequence of work steps that complete one business transaction or customer request. Workflows may be simple or 
complex. Complex workflows can be composed of dozens or hundreds of work 
steps and may include participants from different parts of an organization.
One effective way to capture this information is with a UML activity diagram. An activity diagram describes the various user (or system) activities, the 
person or component that completes each activity, and the sequential flow of 
these activities.
Figure 2-14 shows the basic symbols used in an activity diagram. The flattened ovals represent the individual activities in a workflow. The connecting
