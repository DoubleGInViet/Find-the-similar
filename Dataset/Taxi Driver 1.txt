"The whole conviction of my life now rests upon the belief that loneliness, far from being a rare and curious phenomenon, is the central and inevitable fact of human existence."
--Thomas Wolfe, "God's Lonely Man"
TRAVIS BICKLE, age 26, lean, hard, the consummate loner. On the surface he appears good-looking, even handsome; he has a quiet steady look and a disarming smile which flashes from nowhere, lighting up his whole face. But behind that smile, around his dark eyes, in his gaunt cheeks, one can see the ominous stains caused by a life of private fear, emptiness and loneliness. He seems to have wandered in from a land where it is always cold, a country where the inhabitants seldom speak. The head moves, the expression changes, but the eyes remain ever-fixed, unblinking, piercing empty space.
Travis is now drifting in and out of the New York City night life, a dark shadow among darker shadows. Not noticed, no reason to be noticed, Travis is one with his surroundings. He wears rider jeans, cowboy boots, a plaid western shirt and a worn beige Army jacket with a patch reading, "King Kong Company 1968-70".
He has the smell of sex about him: Sick sex, repressed sex, lonely sex, but sex nonetheless. He is a raw male force, driving forward; toward what, one cannot tell. Then one looks closer and sees the evitable. The clock sprig cannot be wound continually tighter. As the earth moves toward the sun, Travis Bickle moves toward violence.
FILM OPENS on EXT. of MANHATTAN CAB GARAGE. Weather-beaten sign above driveway reads, "Taxi Enter Here". Yellow cabs scuttle in and out. It is WINTER, snow is piled on the curbs, the wind is howling.
INSIDE GARAGE are parked row upon row of multi-colored taxis. Echoing SOUNDS of cabs idling, cabbies talking. Steamy breath and exhaust fill the air.
INT. CORRIDOR of cab company offices. Lettering on ajar door reads:
PERSONAL OFFICE
Marvis Cab Company Blue and White
Cab Co. Acme Taxi
Dependable Taxi Services JRB Cab Company Speedo Taxi Service
SOUND of office busywork: shuffling, typing, arguing.
2.
PERSONAL OFFICE is a cluttered disarray. Sheets with heading "Marvis, B&W, Acme" and so forth are tacked to crumbling plaster wall: It is March. Desk is cluttered with forms, reports and an old upright Royal typewriter.
Dishelved middle-aged New Yorker looks up from the desk. We CUT IN to ongoing conversation between the middle-aged PERSONNEL OFFICER and a YOUNG MAN standing in front on his desk.
The young man is TRAVIS BICKLE. He wears his jeans, boots and Army jacket. He takes a drag off his unfiltered cigarette.
The PERSONNEL OFFICER is beat and exhausted: he arrives at work exhausted. TRAVIS is something else again. His intense steely gaze is enough to jar even the PERSONNEL OFFICER out of his workaday boredom.
PERSONNEL OFFICER (O.S.)
No trouble with the Hack Bureau?
TRAVIS (O.S.)
No Sir.
PERSONNEL OFFICER (O.S.)
Got your license?
TRAVIS (O.S.)
Yes.
PERSONNEL OFFICER
So why do you want to be a taxi
driver?
TRAVIS
I can't sleep nights.
PERSONNEL OFFICER
There's porno theatres for that.
TRAVIS
I know. I tried that.
The PERSONNEL OFFICER, though officious, is mildly probing and curious. TRAVIS is a cipher, cold and distant. He speaks as if his mind doesn't know what his mouth is saying.
PERSONNEL OFFICER
So whatja do now?
3.
TRAVIS
I ride around nights mostly.
Subways, buses. See things. Figur'd
I might as well get paid for it.
PERSONNEL OFFICER
We don't need any misfits around
here, son.
A thin smile cracks almost indiscernibly across TRAVIS' lips.
TRAVIS
You kiddin? Who else would hack
through South Bronx or Harlem at
night?
PERSONNEL OFFICER
You want to work uptown nights?
TRAVIS
I'll work anywhere, anytime. I know
I can't be choosy.
PERSONNEL OFFICER
(thinks a moment)
How's your driving record?
TRAVIS
Clean. Real clean.
(pause, thin smile)
As clean as my conscience.
PERSONNEL OFFICER Listen, son, you gonna get smart, you can leave right now.
TRAVIS
(apologetic)
Sorry, sir. I didn't mean that.
PERSONNEL OFFICER
Physical? Criminal?
TRAVIS
Also clean.
PERSONNEL OFFICER
Age?
PERSONNEL OFFICER
Twenty-six.
4.
PERSONNEL OFFICER
Education?
TRAVIS
Some. Here and there.
PERSONNEL OFFICER
Military record?
TRAVIS
Honorable discharge. May 1971.
PERSONNEL OFFICER
You moonlightin?
TRAVIS
No, I want long shifts.
PERSONNEL OFFICER
(casually, almost to
himself)
We hire a lot of moonlighters here.
TRAVIS
So I hear.
PERSONNEL OFFICER
(looks up at Travis) Hell, we ain't that much fussy anyway. There's always opening on one fleet or another.
(rummages through his
drawer, collecting
various pink, yellow and
white forms)
Fill out these forms and give them
to the girl at the desk, and leave
your phone number. You gotta phone?
TRAVIS
No.
PERSONNEL OFFICER
Well then check back tomorrow.
TRAVIS
Yes, Sir.

CREDITS
CREDITS appear over scenes from MANHATTAN NIGHTLIFE. The snow has melted, it is spring.
5.
A rainy, slick, wet miserable night in Manhattan's theatre district.
Cabs and umbrellas are congested everywhere; well-dressed pedestrians are pushing, running, waving down taxis. The high-class theatre patrons crowding out of the midtown shows are shocked to find that the same rain that falls on the poor and common is also falling on them.
The unremitting SOUNDS of HONKING and SHOUTING play against the dull pitter-patter of rain. The glare of yellow, red and green lights reflects off the pavements and autos.
"When it rains, the boss of the city is the taxi driver" - so goes the cabbie's maxim, proven true by this particular night's activity. Only the taxis seem to rise above the situation: They glide effortlessly through the rain and traffic, picking up whom they choose, going where they please.
Further uptown, the crowds are neither so frantic nor so glittering. The rain also falls on the street bums and aged poor. Junkies still stand around on rainy street corners, hookers still prowl rainy sidewalks. And the taxis service them too.
All through the CREDITS the exterior sounds are muted, as if coming from a distant room or storefront around the corner. The listener is at a safe but privileged distance.
After examining various strata of Manhattan nightlife, CAMERA begins to CLOSE IN on one particular taxi, and it is assumed that this taxi is being driven by TRAVIS BICKLE.
END CREDITS
CUT TO:
Travis's yellow taxi pulls in foreground. On left rear door are lettered the words "Dependable Taxi Service".
We are somewhere on the upper fifties on Fifth Ave. The rain has not let up.
An ELDERLY WOMAN climbs in the right rear door, crushing her umbrella. Travis waits a moment, then pulls away from the curb with a start.
Later, we see Travis' taxi speeding down the rain-slicked avenue. The action is periodically accompanied by Travis' narration. He is reading from a haphazard personal diary.
6.
TRAVIS (V.O.)
(monotone)
April 10, 1972. Thank God for the rain which has helped wash the garbage and trash off the sidewalks.
TRAVIS' POV of sleazy midtown side street: Bums, hookers, junkies.
TRAVIS (V.O.)
I'm working a single now, which means stretch-shifts, six to six, sometimes six to eight in the a.m., six days a week.
A MAN IN BUSINESS SUIT hails Travis to the curb.
TRAVIS (V.O.)
It's a hustle, but it keeps me busy. I can take in three to three-fifty a week, more with skims.
MAN IN BUSINESS SUIT, now seated in back seat, speaks up:
MAN IN BUSINESS SUIT
(urgent)
Is Kennedy operating, cabbie? Is it grounded?
On seat next to TRAVIS is half-eaten cheeseburger and order of french fries. He puts his cigarette down and gulps as he answers:
TRAVIS
Why should it be grounded?
MAN IN BUSINESS SUIT Listen - I mean I just saw the needle of the Empire State Building. You can't see it for the fog!
TRAVIS
Then it's a good guess it's
grounded.
MAN IN BUSINESS SUIT The Empire State in fog means something, don't it? Do you know, or don't you? What is your number, cabbie?
7.
TRAVIS
Have you tried the telephone?
MAN IN BUSINESS SUIT
(hostile, impatient)
There isn't time for that. In other words, you don't know.
TRAVIS
No.
MAN IN BUSINESS SUIT Well, you should know, damn it, or who else would know? Pull over right here.
(points out window)
Why don't you stick your goddamn head out of the goddamn window once in a while and find out about the goddamn fog!
TRAVIS pulls to the curb. The BUSINESS MAN stuffs a dollar bill into the pay drawer and jumps out of the cab. He turns to hail another taxi.
MAN IN BUSINESS SUIT
Taxi! Taxi!
Travis writes up his trip card and drives away.
It is LATER THAT NIGHT. The rain has turned to drizzle.
Travis drives trough another section of Manhattan.
TRAVIS (V.O.)
I work the whole city, up, down,
don't make no difference to me -
does to some.
STREETSIDE: TRAVIS' P.O.V. Black PROSTITUTE wearing white vinyl boots, leopard-skin mini-skirt and blond wig hails taxi. On her arm hangs half-drunk seedy EXECUTIVE TYPE.
TRAVIS pulls over.
PROSTITUTE and JOHN climb into back seat. TRAVIS checks out the action in rear view mirror.
TRAVIS (V.O.)(CONTD)
Some won't take spooks - Hell,
don't make no difference tom me.
TRAVIS' taxi drives through Central Park.
8.
GRUNTS, GROANS coming from back seat. HOOKER and JOHN going at it in back seat. He's having a hard time and she's probably trying to get him to come off manually.
JOHN (O.S.)
Oh baby, baby.
PROSTITUTE (O.S.)
(forceful)
Come on.
TRAVIS stares blankly ahead.
CUT TO:
TRAVIS' APARTMENT. CAMERA PANS SILENTLY across INT. room, indicating this is not a new scene.
TRAVIS is sitting at plain table writing. He wears shirt, jeans, boots. An unfiltered cigarette rests in a bent coffee can ash tray.
CLOSE UP of notebook. It is a plain lined dimestore notebook and the words TRAVIS is writing with a stubby pencil are those he is saying. The columns are straight, disciplined. Some of the writing is in pencil, some in ink. The handwriting is jagged.
CAMERA continues to PAN, examining TRAVIS' apartment. It is unusual, to say the least:
A ratty old mattress is thrown against one wall. The floor is littered with old newspapers, worn and unfolded streets maps and pornography. The pornography is of the sort that looks cheap but costs $10 a threw - black and white photos of naked women tied and gagged with black leather straps and clothesline. There is no furniture other than the rickety chair and table. A beat-up portable TV rests on an upright melon crate. The red silk mass in another corner looks like a Vietnamese flag. Indecipherable words, figures, numbers are scribbled on the plain plaster walls. Ragged black wires dangle from the wall where the telephone once hung.
TRAVIS (V.O.)
They're all animals anyway. All the animals come out at night: Whores, skunk pussies, buggers, queens, fairies, dopers, junkies, sick, venal.
(a beat)
Someday a real rain will come and wash all this scum off the streets.
9.
It's EARLY MORNING: 6 a.m. The air is clean and fresh and the streets nearly deserted.
EXT. of TAXI GARAGE.	TRAVIS' taxi pulls into the driveway.
TRAVIS (V.O.)(CONTD) Each night when I return the cab to the garage I have to clean the come off the back seat. Some nights I clean off the blood.
INT. of TAXI GARAGE. TRAVIS pulls his taxi into garage stall. TRAVIS reaches across the cab and extracts a small vial of bennies from the glove compartment.
TRAVIS stands next to the cab, straightens his back, and tucks the bottle of pills into his jacket pocket. He lowers his head, looks into back seat, opens rear door and bends inside.
He shakes a cigarette out of his pack of camels and lights it.
SLIGHT TIMECUT: TRAVIS books it at garage office. Old, rotting slabs of wood are screwed to a grey crumbling concrete wall. Each available space is covered with hand-lettered signs, time schedules, check-out sheets, memos. The signs read:
BE ALERT!!
THE SAFE DRIVER
IS ALWAYS READY
FOR THE UNEXPECTED
SLOW DOWN
AND GAUGE SPEED TO
ROAD CONDITIONS
YOU CAN'T STOP
ON A DIME!
ALL NIGHT DRIVERS
HAVING PERSONAL INJURY
ACCIDENTS
10.
MUST PHONE IN AT ONCE TO
JUDSON 2-3410
AND MUST FILE A REPORT Promptly
AT 9 AM THE FOLLOWING MORNING AT
W. 61st.
A half dozen haggard cabbies hang around the office. Their shirts are wrinkle, their heads dropping, the mouths incessantly chattering. We pick up snatches of cabbie small talk:
CABBIE
...  hadda piss like a bull steer, so I pull over on 10th Ave, yank up the hood and do the engine job. (gestures as if taking a piss into the hood) There I am with my dong in my hand when a guy come up and asks if I need any help. Just checking the battery, I says, and, meanwhile... 
CABBIE (CONT'D)
(takes imaginary piss)
CABBIE
If he thinks I'm going up into The Jungle this time of night, he can shove it.
CABBIE
(talking into pay phone) Fuck that Violets First. Fucking saddle horse. No, no, the OTB. Fuck them. No, it was TKR. TCR and I'da made seven fucking grand. Fuck them too. Alright, what about the second race?
CABBIE
Over at Love, this hooker took on the whole garage. Blew the whole fucking joint and they wouldn't even let her use the drinking fountain.
Travis hands his trip sheet to a CAB OFFICIAL, nods slightly, turns and walks toward the door.
OUTSIDE, TRAVIS walks pleasantly down Broadway, his hands in his jacket pockets. The sidewalks are deserted, except for diligent fruit and vegetable VENDORS setting up their stalls. He takes a deep breath of fresh air, pulls a white pill from his pocket, pops it into his mouth.
11.
Travis turns a corner, keeps walking. Ahead of him is a 24-hour PORNO THEATRE. The theatre, a blaze of cheap day-glow reds and yellows, is an offense to the clear, crisp morning air. The permanent lettering reads, "Adam Theatre, 16mm Sound Features". Underneath, today's feature are hand-lettered: "Six-Day Cruise" and "Beaver Dam".
Travis stops at the box office, purchases a ticket, and walks in.
INT. PORNO THEATRE
Travis stands in the aisle for a moment. He turns around, walking back toward the concession stand.
CONCESSION STAND
A plain dumpy-looking GIRL sits listlessly on a stool behind the shabby concession stand. A plaster-of-Paris Venus de
Milo sits atop a piece of purple velvet cloth on the counter.
The SOUND of the feature drones in the background.
CONCESSION GIRL
Kin I help ya?
Travis rests his elbow on the counter, looking at the Girl. He is obviously trying to be friendly - no easy task for him. God knows he needs a friend.
TRAVIS
What is your name? My name is
Travis.
CONCESSION GIRL
Awh, come off it, Pal.
TRAVIS
No, I'm serious, really... 
CONCESSION GIRL
Ya want me to call da boss? Huh?
That what you want?
CONCESSION GIRL
No, no, it's alright. I'll have a big Coca-Cola - without ice - and a large buttered popcorn, and... 
(pointing)
... 
12.
some of them chocolate covered malted milk balls...  and ju-jukes, a box. They last.
CONCESSION GIRL
We don't have ju-jukes. We don't have Coca-Cola. We only got Royal Crown Cola.
TRAVIS
That's fine.
CONCESSION GIRL
That's a dollar forty-seven.
Travis lays two dollar bills on the counter.
INT. THEATRE AUDITORIUM
Slight TIMECUT to Travis sitting in theatre, drinking his Royal Crown Cola, eating his popcorn and milk balls. His eyes are fixed on the screen. A MALE VOICE emanates from the screen:
MALE MOVIE VOICE (O.S.) Come here, bitch. I'm gonna split you in half.
Male Voice yields to Travis' monotone narration.
TRAVIS (V.O.)
Twelve hours of work and I still cannot sleep. The days dwindle on forever and do not end.
FADE TO:
EXT. CHARLES PALANTINE CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS
The Headquarters of the "New Yorkers for Charles Palantine for President Committee", located at the corner of 50th Street and Broadway, are festooned in traditional red, white and blue banners, ribbons and signs.
One large sign proclaims "Palantine". Another sign reads "Register for New York Primary, July 20.". The smiling middle-aged face of Charles Palantine keeps watch over the bustling pedestrians.
It is LATE AFTERNOON.
13.
INSIDE HEADQUARTERS
A variety of YOUNG WORKERS joke and chatter as they labor through stacks of papers. The room is pierced with the sound of ringing phones.
Seen from a distance - the only way Travis can see them - those are America's chosen youth: Healthy, energetic, well-groomed, attractive, all recruited from the bucolic fields of Massachusetts and Connecticut.
CAMERA FAVORS BETSY, about 25, an extremely attractive woman sitting at the reception desk between two phones and several stacks of papers. Her attractions, however, are more than skin deep. Beneath that Cover Girl facial there is a keen, though highly specialized sensibility: Her eyes scan every man who passes her desk as her mind computes his desirability: Political, intellectual, sexual, emotional, material. Simple pose and status do not impress her; she seeks out the extraordinary qualities in men. She is, in other words, star-fucker of the highest order.
Betsy, putting down the phone, calls TOM, a lanky, amiable and modishly long-haired campaign workder over to her desk:
BETSY
Tom.
Tom is pleasant and good-looking, but lacks those special qualities which interest Betsy. He gets nowhere with Betsy - yet he keeps trying.
Just another of those routine office flirtations which pass the hours and free the fantasies.
BETSY
Tom, come here a moment.
(he walks over)
I think this canvas report is about ready to go out. Check it out with Andy, and if he okays if, have a copy made for the campaign headquarters in every county.
(a beat)
And don't forget to add the new
photo releases.
TOM
The senator's white paper is almost ready, Bets. Should we wait for that?
14.
BETSY
Andy usually just sends those to the national media. The local press doesn't know what to do with a position paper until UPI and AP tell them anyway.
TOM
I think we should try to get maximum coverage for this new mandatory welfare program. Push the issues.
BETSY
(as if instructing a
child)
First push the man, then the issue. Senator Palantine is first of all a dynamic man, an intelligent, interesting, fascinating man.
TOM
You forgot "sexy".
BETSY
No, I didn't forget "sexy".
TOM
Just didn't get around to it, huh?
BETSY
Oh, Tom, please.
TOM
Well, for Christsakes, you sound like you're selling...  I don't know what...  cars...  not issues.
BETSY
Have you ever wondered why CBS News has the highest ratings?
TOM
More people watch it.
BETSY
Alright, forget it if you're not
going to be serious,
TOM
No, c'mon, I'm listening. I was
just... 
15.
BETSY
Just what?
TOM
Kidding around...  you know, fun.
Betsy looks toward the street, then back at Tom.
BETSY
Maybe if you'd try thinking once in a while, you'd get somewhere.
TOM
With who?
BETSY
Alright, now. You want to know why CBS has the highest ratings? You their news is any different from NBC, ABC? It's all the same news. Same stories. Same order usually. What, you thought they had good news for people, right? You thought that's why people watched CBS? I'll tell you why people watch CBS. Cronkite. The man. You got it? Not the news, not the issues, the man. If Walter Cronkite told people to eat soap, they'd do it. We are selling cars, goddamn it.
Betsy's attention is being distracted by something she sees across the street. She puts on her glasses and looks out across the street again.
TOM
Well, if Cronkite's so great, why don't we run him instead?
BETSY
That's the last. The finish. Period. Some pople can learn. Some people can't. And you wonder why we never get serious----
TOM
Sure we could run him. You realize he's already of his block association.
BETSY
(looks across street
again)
16.
Have you been noticing anything
strange?
TOM
No, why?
BETSY
Why's that taxi driver across the street been staring at us?
TOM
What taxi driver?
BETSY
That taxi driver. The one that's
been sitting here.
TOM
How long has he been there?
BETSY
I don't know - but it feels like a long time.
Travis' cold piercingly eyes Stare out from his cab parked across the street from Palantine Headquarters. He is like a lone wolf watching the warm campfires of civilization from a distance. A thin red dot glows from his cigarette.
Tom exchanges Travis' gaze.
TOM
(determined)
Well, I'll go out and ask him.
As Tom walks toward front door Betsy's eyes alternate between him and the position where Travis sits.
EXT. PALANTINE HEADQUARTERS
Tom strides out the front door and walks briskly across the street toward Travis' taxi.
Travis spots Tom walking toward him and quickly stares up his cab, then squeals off in a burst of billowing exhaust.
Tom watches the speeding taxi quizzically.
Travis' taxi continues down Broadway.
CUT TO:
17.
INT. TRAVIS' APARTMENT
He lies on his mattress at the ceiling. He is fully clothed and appears deep in thought.
Near his mattress rest several medications: A large bottle of vitamin pills, two smaller bottles of pills, a bottle of peach-flavored brandy.
TRAVIS (V.O.)
All my life needed was a sense of direction, a sense of someplace to go. I do not believe one should devote his life to morbid self-attention, but should become a person like other people.
ANOTHER DAY - LATE AFTERNOON
Travis' taxi is driving down Broadway with the "Off Duty" sign on.
POV TRACKING SHOT down Broadway. CAMERA stops at Palantine Campaign Headquarters. A few WORKERS remain in the office. Betsy's desk is vacant.
FIFTH AVENUE - THE SAME AFTERNOON
CAMERA TRACKS with crowded mass of MANHATTANITES as they ooze through the sidewalks toward their various destination. Individuals are indiscernible: It is simply a congested mass.
TRAVIS (V.O.)
I first saw her at Palantine Campaign Headquarters at 58th and Broadway. She was wearing a yellow dress, answering the phone at her desk.
Suddenly: Cut of the congested human mass, IN SLOWING MOTION, appears the slender figure of BETSY in a stylish yellow dress. The crowd parts like the Red Sea, and there she is: Walking all alone, untouched by the crowd, suspended in space and time.
TRAVIS (V.O.)(CONTD) She appeared like an angel out of this open sewer. Out of this filthy mass. She is alone: They cannot touch her.
18.
INT. TRAVIS' APARTMENT
He is at the table, writing in his diary.
CLOSEUP - His stubby pencil rests on the word "her".
CUT TO:
It is 3:30 IN THE MORNING in a bacon-shaped all night WEST SIDE REATAURANT. The thick smell hangs in the air - fried grease, smoke, sweat, regurgitated wine.
Whatever doesn't flush away in New York at night turns up in places like this. A burly grease-stained COOK stands over the grill. A JUNKIE shuffles from one side of the door to another. Slouched over the small four-person formica tables are several WELL-DRESSED BLACKS (too well-dressed for this time and place), a cluster of STREET PEOPLE and a lost OLD COOT who hangs onto his cup of coffee as if it were his last possession.
The restaurant, brightly lit, perfectly conveys the image urban plasticity - without the slightest hint of an accompanying cleanliness.
Toward the rear of the restaurant sit three cabbies: WIZARD, a worn man about fifty, DOUGH-BOY, younger family man, CHARLIE T., fourtyish Black.
Wizard is telling Dough-Boy a story. Charlie T., his elbows popped against table top, is not listening. He stares silently down at a plate of cold scrambled eggs and a Racing Forum. His eyes may not be open.
WIZARD
First she did her make-up. You know, I hate it when they do that. I mean she does the whole works, the mascara, the eye-shadow, the lipstick, the rouge... 
DOUGH-BOY
Not rouge. Blush-On, they call it.
WIZARD
The kind with a brush.
Travis appears at the door. He has to push aside the JUNKIES to enter without making physical contact - something Travis would not relish. He may be repulsed with these people and this place, but he is too much a part of this to let his feelings rise to the surface.
Wizard gives Travis a perfunctory wave.
19.
WIZARD
Travis.
TRAVIS
Hey Wizard.
Travis straddles a seat at the table. Dough-Boy gives Travis something between a wink and an eye-twitch saying:
DOUGH-BOY
Yeah, that's Blush-On. My wife uses it,
WIZARD
(ironic)
Ask Travis. He's the ladies man.
Travis shrugs and motions for a cup of coffee.
WIZARD
(continuing)
Well, whatever the fuck it is, she used it. And then the spray perfume. You know, the real sweat kind - and, on top of that, get this, right when we're crossing the Tri- boro bridge - she changes her pantyhose!
DOUGH-BOY
No.
Travis turns his head. He appears not to be interested, but is.
WIZARD
Yeah.
DOUGH-BOY
Could you see anything?
WIZARD
Well, she was trying to keep her skirt down, sort of, you know. But it was pretty obvious what she was doing. I mean, Christ, it was rush hour and the traffic's practically standing still.
DOUGH-BOY
What did you do?
20.
WIZARD
Threw on the emergency, jumped the seat and fucked her brains out - What do you think!
(they laugh)
What do I have to do? Draw you a
picture?
DOUGH-BOY
Yeah.
WIZARD
What was I supposed to do? I was
watching in the rear view. You
know, just checkin' traffic.
(to Travis)
So howsit?
TRAVIS
(w/o inflection)
Some fleet driver for Bell just cut up. Just heard it on the radio.
DOUGH-BOY
Stick up?
A WAITRESS brings Travis' coffee and a glass of water. He asks for a cheeseburger.
WIZARD
Sure. What do you think? She wanted to get out of the cab. I said "Look, you're in the middle of the fucking bridge... "
DOUGH-BOY
You said that?
WIZARD
Well, I said, "Lady, please, we're on a bridge... "
DOUGH-BOY
And what happened?
Travis awaits Wizard's answer.
WIZARD
She stayed in the cab, what's she gonna do? but she stiffed me. A real skunk.
DOUGH-BOY
A real skunk.
21.
Wizard realizes Travis and Dough-Boy may not have met.
WIZARD
(paternal)
Travis, you know Dough-Boy, Charlie
T.?
Charlie T. nods sleepily. Travis indicates he knows Dough-Boy.
DOUGH-BOY
Yeah. We went to Harvard together.
(laughs)
WIZARD
We call him Dough-Boy cause he
likes the dollars. He'll chase a
buck straight into Jersey.
DOUGH-BOY
Look who's talking?
(gestures around table)
Who else would stay up all night to catch the morning rush hour?
Travis sips his coffee. Charlie T.'s eyelids slip shut.
WIZARD
(to Travis)
So howsit?
TRAVIS
(w/o inflection)
Some fleet driver for Bell just got cut up. Just heard it on the radio.
DOUGH-BOY
Stick up?
TRAVIS
No, just some crazy fucker. Cut
have his ear off.
DOUGH-BOY
Where.
TRAVIS
In the jungle. 122nd.
Travis' eyes turn toward the restaurant's other patrons.
22.
POV: THREE STREET PEOPLE sitting at a table. One GUY, stoned, stares straight ahead. A raggedly attractive GIRL rest her head on the shoulder of the other, a heavily bearded YOUNG MAN with a headband. They kiss and tease each other, momentarily lost in their separate world.
Travis watches the hippie couple closely, his feeling sharply divided between cultural contempt and morose jealousy. Why should these people enjoy the love and intimacy that has always eluded him? He must enjoy these schizoid emotions, because his eyes dwell on the couple.
DOUGH-BOY
(changing the subject)
You run all over town, don't you, Travis?
WIZARD
(referring to 122nd St.) Fuckin' Mau Mau land, that's what it is.
Travis turns back to his companions.
TRAVIS
Huh?
DOUGH-BOY
I mean, you handle some pretty
rough traffic, huh?
TRAVIS
(catching on)
I have.
DOUGH-BOY
You carry a piece? You need one?
TRAVIS
Nah.
(a beat)
I suppose not.
Waitress slaps down smudge-marked glass of water, and a cheeseburger plate that looks more like a shrunken head on a serving platter.
DOUGH-BOY
Well, you ever need one, I know a feller that kin getcha a real nice deal. Lotsa shit around.
23.
WIZARD
The cops and company raise hell
they find out.
Travis drops two Alka-Seltzer into his glass of water.
DOUGH-BOY
Truck drivers bring up Harlem Specials that blow up in your hand. But this guy don't deal no shit. Just quality. If you ever need anything, I can put you in touch.
WIZARD
For a fee.
DOUGH-BOY
For a fee.
WIZARD
I never use mine. But it's a good thing to have. Just as a threat.
DOUGH-BOY
(getting up)
well, if there's this many hackies inside, there must be lots of hares outside. And I'm gonna hustle 'em.
WIZARD
What ya gonna do with all that
money, Dough-Boy?
DOUGH-BOY
Support my kids. Can you dig it?
(pause)
nice to meet ya, Travis. So long, Wizard. Say hello to Malcolm X for me.
(nods to Charlie T.)
Charlie T. remains unmoved: He is sleeping.
Dough-Boy exits. Travis smiles perfunctorily, then looks back at Wizard. They really don't have much to talk about, and the Wizard doesn't care to manufacture any more conversations.
Travis scans the greasy spoon: The scene is unchanged.
CUT TO:
24.
EXT. PALANTINE HEADQUARTERS - ANOTHER DAY
Traffic passes.
INT. PALANTINE HEADQUARTERS
Tom and Betsy are talking. She takes out a cigarette. He takes out matches to light it.
BETSY
Try holding the match like this.
TOM
This is gotta be a game, right?
BETSY
(putting on glasses)
This I gotta see.
TOM
(burning fingers)
Ouch!
BETSY
(giggling)
Oh, are you all right?
TOM
I'm great. Always set my fingers on fire. If you want to see another trick. I do this thing with my nose.
BETSY
No. I just wanted to see if you could light it that way. The guy at the newsstand can.
TOM
Ah, yes, the guy at the newsstand,
Mr. Asbestos... 
BETSY
He happens to be missing fingers. I first noticed when -
TOM
Is he Italian?
BETSY
No, why?
TOM
You sure he's not Italian?
25.
BETSY
He's Black, OK?
TOM
Well, If he had been Italian, they could have been shot off. Sometimes the mob does that to teach guys a lesson, If they blow a job or something.
BETSY
As I said, he isn't Italian. Besides, I thought they just killed them.
TOM
Don't be naive. They can't kill everybody. They have different punishments for different things. Like, if they kill a stool pidgeon, they leave a canary on the body. It's symbolic.
BETSY
Why don't they leave a pidgeon
instead of a canary?
TOM
I don't know. Maybe they don't leave a canary. Don't be technical. What I'm saying is if this newsstand guy's Italian and his fingers are gone, maybe he's a thief.
BETSY
First, he's not Italian. Second he's not a thief. I noticed the fingers when he was getting my change - the right change. Two of his fingers are missing. Just stubs. Like they were blown away. I was putting my change in my purse when I saw him get out a cigarette. I couldn't help watching. I was dying to see how he'd light it.
TOM
With the other hand, right?
BETSY
No, stupid. With the stubs. That's the whole point.
26.
TOM
I know that guy. His hand looks like a paw. An old Black guy, the newsstand at -
BETSY
No, this is young - well, I'm never sure how old Black people are - but, anyway, he isn't old. That's for sure.
TOM
Show me how he did that again.
EXT. ACROSS THE STREET FROM HEADQUARTERS
Travis is striding briskly across Broadway toward the Palantine Headquarters.
He s dressed the best we have seen him; his pants (not jeans) are pressed, his boots shined, his hair combed. Under his Army jacket he wears a freshly laundered shirt and ivy league tie. He drops his cigarette, steps on it and walks in.
Watching Travis enter Palantine's Headquarters, we are surprised to realize that Travis is really quite attractive. His deformities are psychological, not physical. He believes he is cursed, and therefore he is.
Travis walks briskly into the office, and heads toward Betsy's desk. Tom walks over to greet him, but Travis ignores him.
TRAVIS
(at Betsy's desk)
I want to volunteer.
As the CAMERA examines Travis' face more closely, one can see the hollowness wrought by lack of sleep and sufficient diet.
TOM
(at Betsy's desk)
If you'll come this way.
Travis elbows Tom off.
TRAVIS
(to Betsy)
No. I want to volunteer to you.
27.
TOM
(under his voice)
Bets.
BETSY waves TOM off with a short gesture, indicating everything is OK. He walks away.
BETSY
(curious)
And why is that?
TRAVIS is on his best behavior.	He smiles slightly:
TRAVIS
Because you are the most beautiful woman I have ever seen.
BETSY is momentarily taken back, but pleased. TRAVIS' presence has a definite sexual charge. He has those star qualities BETSY looks for: She senses there is something special about the young man who stands before her. And then, too, there is that disarming smile. He is, as Betsy would say, "fascinating".
BETSY
(smiling)
Is that so?
(pause)
But what do you think of Charles
Palantine?
TRAVIS
(his mind elsewhere)
Who mam?
BETSY
Charles Palantine. The man you want to volunteer to help elect president.
TRAVIS
Oh, I think he's a wonderful man.
Make a great, great President.
BETSY
You want to canvass?
TRAVIS
Yes, mam.
Betsy is interviewing Travis, but she is also teasing him a little, leading him on in a gentle feminine way:
28.
BETSY
How do you feel about Senator
Palantine's stand on welfare?
This takes TRAVIS back a bit. He obviously doesn't have the slightest idea what Palantine's stand on welfare is, in fact, he doesn't have any idea about politics whatsoever. TRAVIS thinks a moment, then improvises an answer:
TRAVIS
Welfare, mam? I think the Senator's right. People should work for a living. I do. I like to work. Every day. Get those old coots off welfare and make 'em work for a change.
Betsy does a subtle double-take: This isn't exactly Palantine's position on welfare. She remain intrigued by Travis.
BETSY
Well, that's not exactly what the Senator has proposed. You might not want to canvass, but there is plenty more other work we need done: Office work, filing, poster hanging.
TRAVIS
I'm a good worker, Betsy mam, a
real good worker.
BETSY
(gesturing)
if you talk to Tom, he'll assign
you to something.
TRAVIS
If you don't mind, mam, I'd rather work for you.
BETSY
Well, we're all working tonight.
TRAVIS
Well, Betsy mam, I drive a taxi at night.
BETSY
Well, then, what is it you exactly want to do?
29.
TRAVIS
(bolstering courage)
If you don't mind, mam, I'd be mighty pleased if you'd go out and have some coffee and pie with me.
Betsy doesn't quite know what to make of Travis. She is curious, intrigued, tantalized. Like a moth, she draws closer to the flame.
BETSY
Why?
TRAVIS
Well, Betsy mam, I drive by this place here in my taxi many times a day. And I watch you sitting here at this big long desk with these telephones, and I say to myself, that's a lonely girl. She needs a friend. And I'm gonna be her friend.
(smiles)
Travis rarely smiles, but when he does his whole face glows. It is as if he is able to tap an inner reserve of charm unknown even to himself. Betsy is completely disarmed.
BETSY
I don't know... 
TRAVIS
It's just to the corner, mam. In broad daytime. Nothing can happen. I'll be there to protect you.
BETSY
(smiles)
All right.
(relents)
All right. I'm taking a break at four o'clock. If you're here then we'll go to the corner and have some coffee and pie.
TRAVIS
Oh, I appreciate that, Betsy mam. I'll be here at four o'clock exactly.
(pause)
And...  ah...  Betsy... 
30.
BETSY
Yes?
TRAVIS
My name is Travis.
BETSY
Thank you, Travis.
