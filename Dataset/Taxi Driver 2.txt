Travis nods, turns and exits.
Tom, who has been watching this interchange with a pseudo-standoffish (actually jealous) air, steps over to Betsy. His manner demands some sort of explanation of what Betsy was doing.
Betsy simply shrugs (it's really none of his business) and says:
BETSY
I'm just going to find out what the cabbies are thinking.
CUT TO:
Travis is pacing back and forth on Broadway just beyond the Palantine Headquarters. He checks his watch.
TRAVIS (V.O.)
April 26, 1972. Four o'clock p.m. I took Betsy to the Mayfair Coffee Shop on Broadway... 
INT. COFFEE SHOP
Travis and Betsy are sitting in a booth of a small New York Coffee Shop. They both have been served coffee; Travis is nervously turning his cup around in his hands.
As Travis speaks V.O., WAITRESS brings their orders: Apple pie for TRAVIS, fruit compote for BETSY.
TRAVIS (V.O.)
I had black coffee and apple pie with a slice of melted yellow cheese. I think that was a good selection. Betsy had coffee and a fruit salad dish. She could have had anything she wanted.
Betsy's conversation interrupts Travis' V.O.:
31.
BETSY
We've signed up 15.000 Palantine volunteers in New York so far. The organizational problems are becoming just staggering.
TRAVIS
I know what you mean. I've got the same problems. I just can't get things organized. Little things, I mean. Like my room, my possessions. I should get one of those signs that says, "One of these days I'm Gonna Organezizied".
Travis contorts his mouth to match his mispronunciation, than breaks into a big, friendly, infectious grin. The very sight of it makes one's heart proud.
Betsy cannot help but be caught up in Travis' gin. Travis' contagious, quicksilver moods cause:
BETSY
(laughing)
Travis, I never ever met anybody
like you before.
TRAVIS
I can believe that.
BETSY
Where do you live?
TRAVIS
(evasive)
Oh, uptown. You know. Some joint.
It ain't much.
BETSY
So why did you decide to drive a
taxi at night?
TRAVIS
I had a regular job for a while, days. You know, doin' this, doin' that. But I didn't have anything to do at night. I got kinda lonely, you know, just wandering around. So I decided to works nights. It ain't good to be alone, you know.
BETSY
After this job, I'm looking forward to being alone for a while.
32.
TRAVIS
Yeah, well... 
(a beat)
In a cab you get to meet people.
You meet lotsa people. It's good
for you.
BETSY
What kind of people?
TRAVIS
Just people people, you know. Just people.
(a beat)
Had a dead man once.
BETSY
Really?
TRAVIS
He'd been shot. I didn't know that. He just crawled into the back seat, said "West 45th Street" and conked out.
BETSY
What did you do?
TRAVIS
I shot the meter off, for one thing. I knew I wasn't goimg to get paid. Then I dropped him off at the cop shop. They took him.
BETSY
That's really something.
TRAVIS
Oh, you see lots of freaky stuff in a cab. Especially when the moon's out.
BETSY
The moon?
TRAVIS
The full moon. One night I had three or four weirdoes in a row and I looked up and, sure enough, there it was - the full moon.
Betsy laughs. Travis continues:
33.
TRAVIS
Oh, yeah. People will do anything in front of a taxi driver. I mean anything. People too cheap to rent a hotel room, people scoring dope, people shooting up, people who want to embarrass you.
(a bitterness emerges)
It's like you're not even there,
not even a person. Nobody knows
you.
Betsy cuts Travis' bitterness short:
BETSY
Com'on, Travis. It's not that bad.
I take lots of taxis.
TRAVIS
I know. I could have picked you up.
BETSY
Huh?
TRAVIS
Late one night. About three. At the plaza.
BETSY
Three in the morning? I don't think so. I have to go to bed early. I work days. It must have been somebody else.
TRAVIS
No. It was you. You had some manila folders and a pink bag from Saks.
Betsy, realizing Travis remembers her precisely, scrambles for a polite rationale for her behavior:
BETSY
You're right! Now I remember! It was after the Western regional planners were in town and the meeting went late. The next day I was completely bushed. It was unbelievable.
TRAVIS
If it wasn't for a drunk I would have picked you up. He wanted to go to the DMZ.
34.
BETSY
The DMZ?
TRAVIS
South Bronx. The worst. I tried to ditch him, but he was already in the cab, so I had to take him. That's the law. Otherwise I would have picked you up.
BETSY
That would have been quite a
coincidence.
TRAVIS
You'd be surprised how often you see the same people, get the same fare. People have patterns. They do more or less the same things every day. I can tell.
BETSY
Well, I don't go to the Plaza every night.
TRAVIS
I didn't mean you. But just ordinary people. A guy I know - Dough-Boy - met his wife that way. They got to talking. She said she usually caught the bus so he started picking her up at the bus stop, taking her home with the flag up.
BETSY
That's very romantic. Some of your fares must be interesting. See any stars, politicians, deliver any babies yet?
TRAVIS
Well, no...  not really...  had some famous people in the cab.
(remembering)
I got this guy who makes lasers. Not regular lasers, not the big kind. Little lasers, pocket sized, small enough to clip your belt like a transistor radio, like a gun, you know. Like a ray gun. Zap.
35.
BETSY
(laughs)
What hours do you work?
TRAVIS
I work a single, which means there's no replacement - no second man on the cab. Six to six, sometimes eight. Seventy-two hours a week.
BETSY
(amazed)
You mean you work seventy-two hours a week.
TRAVIS
Sometimes 76 or 80. Sometimes I
squeeze a few more hours in the
morning. Eighty miles a day, a
hundred miles a night.
BETSY
You must be rich.
TRAVIS
(big affectionate smile)
it keeps ya busy.
BETSY
You know what you remind me of?
TRAVIS
What?
BETSY
That song by Kris Kristofferson,
where it's said "Like a pusher,
party truth, partly ficition, a
walking contradiction".
(smiles)
TRAVIS
I'm no pusher, Betsy. Honest. I
never have pushed.
TRAVIS
I didn't mean that, Travis. Just the part about the contradiction.
TRAVIS
(more at ease)
Oh. Who was that again?
36.
BETSY
The singer?
TRAVIS
Yeah. Yes. I don't follow music too much.
BETSY
(slowly)
Kris Kristofferson.
Travis looks at Betsy intently and they exchange smiles.
CUT TO:
Travis is walking confusedly around SAM GOODY'S at MIDDAY, obviously unable to locate what he desires.
Travis is lost among the hip, young intellectual type that populate the store. He watches the stylish, attractive female help, unable to come right out and requests what he desires.
A young SALESGIRL sees his plight, walks over and asks if he needs any help. Travis INAUDIBLY says a name to her, although the name is obviously Kris Kristofferson.
The Salesgirl digs out Kristofferson's "Silver-Tongued Devil" album for him.
Travis says something additional to the Salesgirl and she goes off to gift-wrap the album.
Travis emerges from the RECORD STORE, the brightly gift-wrapped album proudly tucked under his arm.
CUT TO:
A lengthy POV SHOT from Travis' vantage point behind the wheel.
We see the city as Travis sees it. The front windshield is a little dirty, the lighted meter just up at the low right screen. The intercom crackles with STATIC and MESSAGES.
The light turns green; we take off with a start. A short first gear - quick shift - a long second gear. The cab eases to the right of the street, checking out prospective fares.
Our eyes scan the long lines of PEDESTRIANS. The regular - bums, junkies, tourists, hookers, homosexuals, hippies - they mean nothing now. They only blend into the sidewalks and lighted storefronts.
37.
Our eyes now concentrate on those that step away from the curb - is that man hailing a cab or scratching his head?
In the next block there are perhaps three, four fares - quick gas-up through this yellow light - brake sharply - check the action. The first: Tourist, nickel tipper - let the next guy pick them up. Let the second go also, the third
-	there's a live fare. Middle-aged LOCAL WOMAN: Short fare to the East Side, good tip.
We pull to the curb, waiting for her to get in. It is a long wait - a Black STREET WALKER crosses in front of the cab. We focus on (as Travis would) a YOUNG COUPLE embracing in the distance.
As we travel, we hear Travis' random thoughts about selecting fares and tips:
TRAVIS (V.O.)
You work at night, you get an instinct. You can smell them. The big tippers, the stiffs, the trouble makers. Quarter is good tip for Manhattan. Queens is better, Brooklyn is best. go for the guys with suitcases. The rich are the worst tippers, hooks are lousy. Spooks are okay, but they don't live at Park Ave after all.
The meter is activated: $.60 registers. Tick, tick, tick. A quick glance shows the woman is now seated. She says softly, "192 East 89". We take off with another jolt. Cross back up Ave, then cut through the park.
We're zooming up 9th Ave - how many green lights can we string together? Somebody steps out to hail the cab, but quickly steps back again. The meter is up $.90. It'll be a $1.40 fare.
Now through the park and we're almost there. Check the numbers - 134 - 140. End of the block. Fare=$1.40.
Check back mirror - she's getting out two bills. Two quarters and a dime change. Tip'll be either.25 or .35.
The tip comes back: 35 cents - good tip. Good lady. We take off again with a jolt.
This is Travis' world: Dark side streets, garish glaring main streets, quick glances, quicker evaluations - a dozen instantaneous decisions a minute. Are these people, are these objects?
38.
EXT. TRAVIS' TAXI speed down darkened street.
Travis lets off a fare and pulls into line at the Plaza.
TRAVIS (V.O.)
I called Betsy again at her office, and she said maybe we could go to a movie together after she gets off work tomorrow. That's my day off. At first she hesitated, but I called her again and she agreed.
(pause)
Betsy. Betsy what? I forgot to ask her last name again. Damn. I've got to remember stuff like that.
Travis' thoughts are with Betsy, as THREE MEN enter Travis' cab. He activates the meter and pulls off.
MAN'S VOICE
St. Regis Hotel.
Travis checks the mirror. Scanning across the back seat, he recognizes the middle passenger. It is CHARLES PALANTINE, candidate for President. He must have left the Hotel shortly after BETSY.
Tom, seated on the jump seat, checks his watch and speaks deferentially to Palantine:
TOM
It's 12:30 now. You'll have fifteen minutes before the actual luncheon begins.
Palantine nods as his assistant picks up the thread of an earlier conversation.
ASSISTANT
I don't think we have to worry
about anybody here committing
themselves until things start
coming in from California.
Travis recognizes his passenger. He puts out his cigarette.
TRAVIS
(interrupting)
Say, aren't you Charles Palantine, the candidate?
PALANTINE
(only mildly irritated)
Yes I am.
39.
TRAVIS
Well, I'm one of your biggest supporters. I tell everybody that comes in this cab that they should vote for you.
PALANTINE
(pleased; glances to
check Travis' license)
Why, thank you Travis.
TRAVIS
I'm sure you'll win, sir. Everybody I know is going to vote for you.
(a beat)
I was going to put one of your stickers on my taxi but the company said it was against their policy.
PALANTINE
(pleasant)
I'll tell you, Travis, I've learned more about this country sitting in taxi cabs than in the board room of General Motors.
TOM
(joking)
And in some other places too... 
Palantine, his Assistant and Tom all laugh. Palantine, quickly reassuming candiorial mien, speaks to Travis:
PALANTINE
Travis, what single thing would you want the next President of this country to do most?
TRAVIS
I don't know, sir. I don't follow political issues much.
PALANTINE
There must be something... 
TRAVIS
(thinks)
Well, he should clean up this city here. It's full of filth and scum. Scum and filth. It's like an open sewer. I can hardly take it.
40.
TRAVIS
Some days I go out and smell it then I get headaches that just stay and never go away. We need a President that would clean up this whole mess. Flush it out.
Palantine is not a Hubert Humphrey-type professional bullshitter, and Travis' intense reply stops him dead in his tracks. He is forced to fall back on a stock answer but tries to give it some meaning.
PALANTINE
(after a pause)
I know what you mean, Travis, and it's not going to be easy. We're going to have to make some radical changes.
TRAVIS
(turning the wheel)
Damn straight.
EXT. BARCLAY HOTEL
TRAVIS' taxi pulls up in front of the Barclay Hotel.
PALANTINE and AIDE get out of the cab. SECOND AIDE stays in back seat a moment to pay TRAVIS.
PALANTINE looks in front window of cab momentarily and nods goodbye to TRAVIS.
PALANTINE
Nice talking to you, Travis.
TRAVIS
(calling back)
Thank you, sir. You're a good man, sir.
Travis' taxi departs.
PALANTINE and AIDES walk up carpet to the St. Regis.
CAMERA CLOSES IN on PALANTINE as he stops, turns back and watches Travis' departing taxi.
PALANTINE turns back and ascends the hotel steps with his
AIDES.
41.
EXT. MANHATTAN STREET - EARLY MORNING
TRAVIS, dressed to the teeth, walks brightly down the sidewalk. His face is frehsly shaved, his hair combed, his tie straightened.
He pauses in a store window to check his appearance.
Under his arm he carries the gift-wrapped Kristofferson record album.
OUTSIDE PALANTINE HEADQUARTERS
BETSY, smartly dressed, waves goodbye to another CAMPAIGN WORKER and walks out the door to greet him.
A SHORT WHILE LATER, TRAVIS and BETSY are walking down Broadway toward Times Square. BETSY does not let their bodies touch as they walk although TRAVIS contemplates edging closer to her.
Betsy has opened the package and is admiring the record - or, rather, Travis' sentiment behind giving it.
Travis looks around himself with pride: This is a moment in his life - one of the few.
BETSY
You didn't have to spend your money - ?
TRAVIS
(interrupting)
He'll, what else can I do with it all?
Betsy notices that the seal on the record has not been broken.
BETSY
Travis, you haven't even played the record?
TRAVIS
(evasive)
Yeah, well my stereo player is broke. But I'm sure the record is OK.
BETSY
Your stereo broke? God, I could hardly stand that. I live on music.
42.
TRAVIS
I don't follow music much. I'd like to though.
(second thought)
Honest.
BETSY
(pointing to album)
So you haven't heard this record
yet?
TRAVIS
No.
(sly smile)
I thought maybe you could play it for me on your player.
Betsy's face backtracks a bit. Maybe she was wrong to go out with this fellow she doesn't know.
She makes a polite laugh.
LATER. Travis and Betsy are in TIMES SQUARE, turning the corner from Broadway to 42nd Street. Travis carries the album under his arm.
They approach the garish marquee of a large midtown porno theatre advertising "The Swedish Marriage Manual". The box office is flanked on both sides by glass cages filled with explicit publicity stills. Offending portions have been blocked out with black tape.
Travis steps over to the window and buys two $5 tickets.
Betsy, befuddled, watches him. She doesn't know what to say.
Travis returns with the tickets.
Betsy still has not fully comprehended what is happening:
BETSY
What are you doing?
TRAVIS
(innocent)
I bought a couple of tickets.
BETSY
But this is a porno movie.
TRAVIS
No, these are the kind that couples go to. They're not like the other movies. All kinds of couples go. Honest. I've seen them.
43.
Travis seems confused. He is so much part of his own world, he fails to comprehend another's world. Compared to the movies he sees, this is respectable. But then there's also something that Travis could not even acknowledge, much less admit: That he really wants to get this pure white girl into that dark porno theatre.
Travis makes an awkward gesture to escort Betsy into the theatre. Betsy looks at the tickets, at the theatre, at Travis. She mentally shakes her head and walks toward the turnstile. She thinks to herself: "What the Hell. What can happen?" She's always been curious about these pictures anyway, and - like all women, no matter how intelligent - she's been raised not to offend her date. A perverse logic which applies even more in offsetting circumstances like these.
INSIDE THE THEATER
Travis escorts Betsy to an empty center row. Travis was right. Couples do go to films like this. There are at least six or seven other MEN with their bewigged "DATES".
Travis settles into his familiar porno theatre slouch. Betsy looks curiously from side to side.
ON SCREEN, a conservatively-dressed middle-aged woman is speaking in Swedish about importance of healthy sex life in a happy marriage. Subtitles translate her words. Then, without warning, there is a direct CUT to a couple copulating on a sterile table-like bed.
Travis watches intently. The color, however, is slowly draining from Betsy's cheeks. One thought fills her mind: "What am I doing here?"
TRAVIS
(to himself)
Damn.
BETSY
What's wrong?
TRAVIS
I forgot to get the Coca-Cola.
That does it. Betsy just looks at him for a moment, then gets up and starts to leave. Travis, confused, hustles after her.
He follows her out of the theatre.
44.
ON THE SIDEWALK
Travis catches up with her.
TRAVIS
Where are you going?
BETSY
I'm leaving.
TRAVIS
What do you mean?
Betsy looks at Travis, trying to understand him:
BETSY
These are not the kind of movies I go to.
TRAVIS
Well, I don't follow movies too
much... 
BETSY
You mean these are the only kind of movies you go to?
The TICKET GIRL watches expressionlessly from the booth.
TRAVIS
This is sort of high class... 
BETSY
I mean porno movies.
TRAVIS
(hesitant)
Well...  mostly... 
BETSY
My God!
TRAVIS
We can go to another movie if you like, I don't care. I got money. There's plenty... 
Travis gestures toward the long row of 42nd Street marquees, but is interrupted by Betsy:
BETSY
If you just wanted to fuck, why didn't you just come right out and say it?
45.
Travis is flabbergasted by Betsy's blunt language. His arm still gestures toward the marquees, his lips continue to move, but words do not come out.
Unable to respond to Betsy's question, Travis picks up where he left off:
TRAVIS
...  there's plenty of movies around here. I haven't seen any of them, but I'm sure they're good.
BETSY
No, Travis. You're a sweet guy and all that, but I think this is it. I'm going home.
TRAVIS
(interrupting)
You mean you don't want to go to a movie?
(a beat)
There's plenty of movies around
here.
BETSY
No, I don't feel so good. We're
just two very different kinds of
people, that's all.
TRAVIS
(puzzled)
Huh?
BETSY
It's very simple. You go your way,
I'll go mine. Thanks anyway,
Travis.
TRAVIS
But...  Betsy... 
BETSY
I'm getting a taxi.
She walks to the curb.
TRAVIS
(following her)
What about the record?
BETSY
Keep it.
46.
TRAVIS
Can I call you?
Betsy looks for a cab.
TRAVIS
(tender)
Please, Betsy, I bought it for you.
Betsy looks at his sad, sweet face and relents a bit.
BETSY
All right, I'll accept the record.
Betsy accepts the record, but quickly turns and hails a taxi.
BETSY
Taxi!
A taxi quickly pulls up.
Travis feebly protests to no one in particular:
TRAVIS
But I got a taxi.
Betsy gives instructions to CAB DRIVER, looks briefly back at Travis, then straight ahead. Taxi speeds off.
Travis looks around helplessly: A cluster of PEDESTRIANS on the crowded street has stopped to watch the argument. Travis looks back at the woman in the porno theatre box office who has also been following the argument.
CUT TO:
INSIDE TRAVIS' APARTMENT
Travis is sitting at the table. There are some new items on the table: His giant econo-sized bottle of vitamins, a giant econo-sized bottle of aspirins, a pint of apricot brandy, a partial loaf of cheap white bread.
On the wall behind the table hang two more items: A gag sign reading "One of These Days I'm Gonna Get Organezizied" and an orange-and-black bumper sticker for Charles Palantine.
TRAVIS (V.O.)
May 8, 1972. My life has taken another turn again. The days move along with regularity... 
47.
C.U. of notebook: Travis is no longer sitting at the desk.
The pencil rests on the open notebook.
LATER THAT DAY: TRAVIS has pulled his straight-backed chair around and is watching his small portable TV, which rests on the upright melon crate.
A cereal bowl partially filled with milk rests in his lap. Travis pours a couple shots of the apricot brandy into the bowl, dips folded chunks of white bread into the mixture, and eats them.
Travis is watching early evening NEWS PROGRAM. TV background SOUND. Charles Palantine is being interviewed somewhere on the campaign trail.
TRAVIS (V.O.)(CONTD)
...  one day indistinguishable from the next, a long continuous chain, then suddenly - there is a change.
Betsy is walking down a midtown street when Travis suddenly appears before her. He has been waiting.
Travis tries to make conversation but she doesn't listen.
She motions for him to go away and keeps on walking.
Travis, protesting, follows.
CUT TO:
INT. BUILDING - DAY
Travis speaks intensely into a wall pay phone.
TRAVIS (V.O.)
I tried to call her several times.
We hear Travis' Voice on the phone.
TRAVIS
(smoking a cigarette)
you feeling better? You said you
didn't feel so good... 
TRAVIS (V.O.)
But after the first call, she would no longer come to the phone.
Travis holds the receiver in his hand. The other party has hung up.
TRACKING SHOT across interior lower wall of TRAVIS' APARTMENT.
48.
Against the stark wall there is a row of wilted and dying floral arrangements. Each one of the four or five bouquets is progressively more wilted than the one closer to the door. They have been returned.
TRAVIS (V.O.)
I also sent flowers with no luck. I should not dwell on such things, but set them behind me. The smell of the flowers only made me sicker. The headaches got worse I think I've got stomach cancer. I should not complain so. "You're only as healthy as you feel."
A drama is acted out at PALANTINE HEADQUARTERS: Travis, groggy and red-eyed from lack of sleep, walks into the campaign headquarters about NOONTIME.
Betsy is standing near the rear of the office; she ducks from sight when she sees Travis enter. Travis' path is cut short by Tom's large-framed body. There is no live sound.
TRAVIS (V.O.)
I realize now how much she is like the others, so cold and distant. Many people are like that. They're like a union.
Travis tries to push his way past Tom but Tom grabs him.
Travis says something sharply to Tom and the two scuffle.
Tom, by far the taller and stronger, quickly overcomes
Travis, wrenching his arm behind his back.
Travis kicks and protests as Tom leads him to the front door.
ON THE SIDEWALK
Travis' efforts quickly subside when Tom motions to a nearby POLICEMAN. Travis quiets down and walks off.
CUT TO:
EXT.
Travis is again making his way through the garish urban night. He stops for a PASSENGER on PARK AVE. A middle-aging professorial executive.
C.U. TRAVIS: His face is expressionless. The MAN makes himself comfortable in the back seat.
49.
PROFESSIONAL PASSENGER
Jackson Heights.
Travis has no intention of driving out to Jackson Heights and coming back with a fare.
TRAVIS
I'm off duty.
PROFESSIONAL PASSENGER You mean you don't want to go out to Jackson Heights?
TRAVIS
No, I'm off duty.
PROFESSIONAL PASSENGER Then how come your "Off Duty" light wasn't on.
TRAVIS switches on the "Off Duty" light.
TRAVIS
It was on.
(gesturing toward top of
taxi)
it just takes a while to warm up.
Like a TV.
TRAVIS doesn't budge. PROFESSIONAL PASSENGER curses to himself and exits cab. Travis takes off.
POV as Travis' eyes dwell on the young HIP COUPLES coming out of a East Side movie house.
LATER THAT NIGHT, TRAVIS pulls over for a young (mid-twenties) MAN wearing a leather sports jacket.
TRAVIS eyes his passenger in rear-view mirror.
YOUNG PASSENGER
Central Park West.
EXT.
TRAVIS' taxi speeds off.
LATER, TRAVIS' taxi slows down as it approaches 400 block of Central Park West.
Travis checks apartment numbers.
50.
YOUNG PASSENGER
Just pull over to the curb a
moment.
TRAVIS turns the wheel.
YOUNG PASSENGER
Yeah, that's fine. Just sit here.
TRAVIS waits impassively. The motor ticks away.
After a long pause, the PASSENGER speaks:
YOUNG PASSENGER
Cabbie, ya see that light up there
on the seventh floor, three windows
from this side of the building?
CAMERA CLOSES IN on 417 Central Park West: TRACKING UP to the seventh floor, it moves three windows to the right.
TRAVIS (V.O.)
Yeah.
A young WOMAN wearing a slip crosses in front of the light.
YOUNG PASSENGER (O.S.)
Ya see that woman there?
TRAVIS (O.S.)
Yeah.
YOUNG PASSENGER (O.S.)
That's my wife.
(a beat)
But it ain't my apartment.
(a beat)
A nigger lives there.
(a beat)
She left me two weeks ago. It took me this long to find out where she went.
(a beat)
I'm gonna kill her.
C.U. TRAVIS' face: it is devoid of expression.
YOUNG PASSENGER
What do you think of that, cabbie?
C.U. YOUNG PASSENGER's face: it is gaunt, drained of blood, full of fear and anger.
Travis does not respond.
51.
YOUNG PASSENGER
Huh?
(a beat)
What do you think of that, huh?
Travis shrugs, gesturing toward meter.
YOUNG PASSENGER
I'm gonna kill her with a .44
Magnum pistol.
CAMERA returns to SEVENTH FLOOR WINDOW. Woman is standing in the light.
YOUNG PASSENGER (O.S.) Did you ever see what a .44 can do to a woman's face, cabbie?
(pause)
Did you ever see what it can do to a woman's pussy, cabbie?
Travis says nothing.
YOUNG PASSENGER (O.S.) I'm going to put it right up to her, cabbie. Right in her, cabbie. You must think I'm real sick, huh? A real pervert. Sitting here and talking about a woman's pussy and a .44, huh?
CAMERA CLOSES IN on Travis' face: He is watching the woman in the seventh floor window with complete and total absorption. It's the same glazed-over stare we saw in his eyes as he watched the porno movie.
FADE TO:
BROOKLYN STREET CORNER - DAY
Travis stands near the corner wearing his boots, jeans, western shirt and army jacket.
He pulls his aspiring bottle out of his pocket, shakes three or four into his palm, pops them into his mouth and chews.
An "Off Duty" taxi pulls up to the curb. Travis gets in.
INSIDE TAXI
Dough-Boy leans back from the wheel
and greets Travis as he enters.
52.
DOUGH-BOY
Hey Travis. This here's Easy Andy.
He's a travelling salesman.
In the back seat, beside Travis, sits ANDY, an attractive young man about 29. He wears a pin-striped suit, white shirt and floral tie. His hair is modishly long.
ANDY
Hello Travis.
Travis nods as the taxi speeds off.
Dough-Boy slows down near an economy hotel. Not a flop house, but not do fancy they care what the guests do in the privacy of their rooms.
ANDY
This is fine, Dough-Boy
(to Travis)
Pay Dough-Boy here.
Travis pulls a twenty out of his pocket and gives it to Dough-Boy.
TRAVIS
bucks?
DOUGH-BOY
(takes bill)
Yeah. Hey thanks. That's real nice, Travis.
Travis and Andy get out of the cab and walk toward the hotel. Dough-Boy pulls away.
As they enter the hotel, they pass a JUNKIE, stoned out and spread-eagled across the hood of a derelict old blue dodge.
INT. HOTEL
Travis follows Andy up the worn carpeted stairs and down the hallway. Andy unlocks the door to one of the rooms.
The HOTEL ROOM is barren and clean; there's no sign anyone is staying in it. The fire escape is appropriately near.
Andy locks the door behind them, steps over to the closet, unlocks it and pulls out two grey Samsonite suitcases - the kind you can drive a truck over.
53.
ANDY
Dough-Boy probably told you I don't
carry any Saturday Night Specials
or crap like that. It's all out of
State, clean, brand new, top-of-
the-line stuff.
Andy places the suitcases on the white bedspread. The suitcases are equipped with special locks, which he quickly opens.
Andy opens the suitcases: Stacked in grey packing foam are rows and rows of brand new hand guns.
TRAVIS
You got a .44 Magnum?
ANDY
That's an expensive gun.
TRAVIS
I got money.
Andy unzips a cowhide leather pouch to reveal a .44 Magnum pistol. He holds it gingerly, as if it were a precious treasure. Andy opens the chambers and cradles the long eight-inch barrel in his palm. The .44 is a huge, oversize inhuman gun.
ANDY
(admiringly)
It's a monster. Can stop a car -- put a bullet right into the block. A premium high resale gun. $350 -- that's only a hundred over list.
Easy Andy is a later version of the fast-talking, good-looking kid in college who was always making money on one scheme or another. In high school he sold lottery tickets, in college he scored dope, and now he's hustling hand guns.
Andy holds the Magnum out for Travis' inspection. There's a worshipful CLOSEUP of the .44 Magnum. It is a monster.
Travis hefts the huge gun. It seems out of place in his hand. It is built on Michelangelo's scale. The Magnum belongs in the hand of a marble god, not a slight taxi driver. Travis hands the gun back to Andy.
ANDY
I could sell this gun in Harlem for $500 today - but I just deal high quality goods to high quality people.
54.
(pause)
Now this may be a little big for practical use, in which case I'd recommend the .38 Smith and Wesson Special. Fine solid gun - nickel plated. Snub-nosed, otherwise the same as the service revolver. Now that'll stop anything that moves and it's handy, flexible.
ANDY
The Magnum, you know, that's only if you want to splatter it against the wall. The movies have driven up the price of the Magnum anyway.
Everybody wants them now. But the Wesson .38 - only $250 - and worth every dime of it.
(he hefts the .38)
Throw in a holster for $10.
Travis hefts the nickel-plated .38, points it out the window.
ANDY
Some of these guns are like toys, but a Smith and Wesson, man, you can hit somebody over the head with it and it will still come back dead on. Nothing beats quality.
(pause)
You interested in an automatic?
TRAVIS
I want a .32.	Revolver. And a
palm gun. That .22 there.
ANDY
That's the Colt .25 - a fine little gun. Don't do a lot of damage, but it's as fast as the Devil. Handy little gun, you can carry it almost anywhere. I'll throw it in for another $125.
Travis holds the .32 Revolver, hefts it, slips it under his belt and pulls his shirt over it. He turns from side to side, to see how it rides in his waist.
TRAVIS
How much for everything.
55.
ANDY
The .32's $150 - and you're really getting a good deal now - and all together it comes to, ah, seven eighty-five for four pieces and a holster. He'll, I'll give you the holster, we'll make it seventy-five and you've got a deal - a good one.
TRAVIS
How much to get a permit to carry?
ANDY
Well, you're talking big money now. I'd say at least five grand, maybe more, and it would take a while to check it out. The way things are going now $5.000 is probably low. You see, I try not to fool with the small-time crap. Too risky, too little bread. Say 6 G's, but if I get the permit it'll be as solid as the Empire State Building.
TRAVIS
Nah, this'll be fine.
ANDY
You can't carry in a cab even with a permit - so why bother?
TRAVIS
Is there a firing range around?
ANDY
Sure, here, take this card, go to this place and give 'em the card. They'll charge you, but there won't be any hassle.
Travis pulls out a roll of crisp one hundred dollar bills and counts off eight.
ANDY
You in Nam? Can't help but notice your jacket?
TRAVIS
(looking up)
Huh?
56.
ANDY
Vietnam? I saw it on your jacket. Where were you? Bet you got to handle a lot of weapons out there.
Travis hands Andy the bills. Andy counts them and gives Travis a twenty and five.
TRAVIS
Yeah. I was all around. One
hospital, then the next.
ANDY
(through counting)
It's he'll out there all right. A real shit-eatin' war. I'll say this, though: It's bringing a lot of fantastic guns. The market's flooded. Colt automatics are all over.
(pockets the money)
TRAVIS
(intensely)
They'd never get me to go back.
They'd have to shoot me first.
(pause)
You got anything to carry these in?
(gestures to pistols)
Travis is like a light switch: For long periods he goes along dark and silent, saying nothing; then suddenly, the current is turned on and the air is filled with the electricity of his personality. Travis' inner intensity sets Andy back a bit, but he quickly recovers.
ANDY
Sure.
Andy pulls a gym bag from under his bed. He wraps the gun in the sheet in the bag and zips it up. An identical gym bag can be partially seen under the bed. He hands Travis the bag.
ANDY
You like ball games?
TRAVIS
Huh?
57.
ANDY
I can get you front and center. What do you like? I can get you Mets, Knicks, Rangers? Hell, I can get you the Mayor's box.
TRAVIS
Nah. I ain't interested.
Andy closes and locks the suitcases.
ANDY
Okay, okay.
Travis turns to leave.
ANDY
Wait a second, Travis. I'll walk
you out.
CUT TO:
SEVERAL WEEKS LATER. The face of TRAVIS' apartment has changed. The long, blank wall behind the table is now covered with tacked-up charts, pictures, newspaper-clippings, maps. CAMERA does not come close enough to discern the exact contents of these clippings.
Travis is in C.U. in the middle of the floor doing push-ups. He is bareback, wearing only his jeans. There is a long scar across his left side.
TRAVIS (V.O.)
May 29, 1972. I must get in shape. Too much sitting has ruined my body. Twenty-five push-ups each morning, one hundred sit-ups, one hundred knee-bends. I have quit smoking.
Travis, still bareback, passes his stiff arm through the flame of a gas burner without flinching a muscle.
TRAVIS (V.O.)
Total organization is necessary.
Every muscle must be tight.
INT. FIRING RANGE
The CRACKING SOUND of rapid-fire pistol shots fills the musty air of the firing range. The walls are heavily soundproofed, and sawdust is spread over the floor.
58.
Travis stands rock solid, firing the .44 Magnum at an arm's length. With each blasting discharge from the Magnum, Travis' body shudders and shakes, his arm as if each recoil from the giant gun was a direct attack on his masculinity.
Travis fires the Magnum as quickly as he can re-set, re-aim and re-fire. The Magnum is empty, he sets it down, picks up the .38 Special and begins firing as soon as he can aim.
After the .38, comes the .25: It is as if he were in a contest to see how quickly he can fire the pistols. After all the guns are discharged, he begins reloading them without a moment's hesitation.
Downrange, the red and white targets have the black outline of a human figure drawn over them. The contour-man convulses under the steady barrage of Travis' rapid-fire shots.
INT. APARTMENT
TRAVIS, now wearing an unfastened green plaid western shirt, sits at the table writing in his diary. The vial of bennies is on the table.
TRAVIS (V.O.)
My body fights me always. It won't work, it won't sleep, it won't shit, it won't eat.
LATER. TRAVIS, his shirt still revealing his bare chest, sits on his straight-backed chair watching the TV. The .44 Magnum rests on his lap.
The TV is Broadcasting ROCK TIME, a late afternoon local teenage dance and rock show. On screen YOUNG TEENYBOPPERS are dancing, and the TV CAMERAMAN, as any devotee of the genre knows, is relentlessly ZOOMING-IN on their firm young breasts, fannies and crotches -- a sensibility which reflects TRAVIS' own. These supper-hour rock dance shows are the most unabashedly voyeuristic form of broadcasting the medium has yet developed.
The HARD ROCK NUMBER ends, and the TV CAMERA CUTS TO the local DISC JOCKEY, a hirsute plastic-looking man about 35. FIVE scrumptious TEENYBOPPERS are literally hanging on his shoulders and arms, their faces turned up to him in droolish awe. Out of his mouth comes an incessant stream of disc jockey blather. He is the complete asshole; I don't know who is currently performing this function in New York, but in Los Angeles his name is Real Don Steele.
TV DISC JOCKEY
Freshingly, fantastic, freaked-out
dance time. Can you dig it? Dig on
it. You got it, flaunt it.
59.
TRAVIS watches the show, his face hard and unmoving. He is, as the Scriptures would say, pondering all these things in his heart. Why is it the assholes get all the beautiful young chicks? He takes a swig of peach brandy.
CUT TO:
EARLY EVENING, about 6:30 p.m. TRAVIS' taxi, with 'Off Duty' light on, sits near the curb somewhere in midtown Manhattan.
TRAVIS runs his hand down the left side of his jacket, attempting to smooth out the bulge underneath.
TRAVIS opens his jacket partially, checking underneath.
There rests the nickel-plated .38 Special in its holster.
P.O.V. down the street where TRAVIS' taxi is parked: Several blocks ahead the red, white and blue campaign headquarters of CHARLES PALANTINE are visible.
TRAVIS' eyes resume their watch.
TRAVIS starts the car and drives toward the PALANTINE HEADQUARTERS.
TRACKING P.O.V. shot of row of storefronts leading up to Palantine Headquarters. P.O.V. passes headquarters: it is half-empty. A few stalwart SUPPORTERS continue to work toward the rear of the office. BETSY'S desk ----
Sign in window reads: "Only 4 More Days Until Arrival of
CHARLES PALANTINE." TRAVIS' "Off Duty" light goes off as he speeds up and heads toward a prospective fare.
LATER THAT NIGHT, about 9:30. UPTOWN -- 128th and Amsterdam. The Jungle. TRAVIS' taxi pulls up to an address, lets off
YOUNG BLACK MAN.
TRAVIS receives fare and tip, takes off.
P.O.V. as TRAVIS works his way through Harlem back down Seventh Ave. Cluster of YOUNG BLACK STREET PUNKS pretend to hail cab -- we ignore them. One throws wine bottle which crashes in our path -- taxi swerves to avoid it.
CAMERA TRACKS through sidewalk CROWDS with the roving, suspicious, antagonistic eye of a taxi-driver.
60.
LATER THAT NIGHT, about 12:30. TRAVIS is on the LOWER EAST SIDE, somewhere on B Street, east of Tompkins Square.
The sidewalks are populated with the remains of what once was the hippie movement: TEENAGE STREET-WALKERS, JUNKIES, THUGS, emaciated LONERS on the prowl.
TRAVIS' taxi pulls over, letting out a fare.
TRAVIS pockets his fare, but the rear right door doesn't slam -- instead there is the SOUND of another person jumping into the cab.
TRAVIS checks the back seat in the rear-view mirror: there sits a pale HIPPIE PROSTITUTE.
The GIRL is, at best, 14 or 15, although she has been made up to look older. She wears floppy, Janis Joplin clothes. Her face is pallid. She wears large blue-tinted sunglasses and multi-colored leg stockings.
Her name, as we shall learn later, is IRIS.
TRAVIS hesitates, looking at her in the mirror.
IRIS
Come on, mister, let's get outta
here -- quick.
TRAVIS moves to activate the meter, when the rear door opens.
IRIS is helped out of the cab by a MAN TRAVIS cannot see.
SPORT
(to IRIS)
Come on, baby, let's go. This is all a real drag.
IRIS lets herself be taken out of the cab. The rear door closes.
Sport leans partially in the front window, throwing something on the front seat. TRAVIS looks: it is a crumpled $20 bill.
SPORT
Just forget all about this, cabbie.
It's nothing.
TRAVIS cannot see the Sport's face lime green completely, but notices he is wearing a jacket. The voice is that of a man in his early twenties.
61.
TRAVIS turns to catch a glimpse of Sport as he walks off with Iris.
TRAVIS shrugs and turns around.
TRAVIS' taxi pulls away.
