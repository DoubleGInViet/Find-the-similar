EARLY MORNING, 6:00 a.m.	Quitting time -- TRAVIS pulls into
TAXI GARAGE.
INT. GARAGE
TRAVIS pulls into his stall.
TRAVIS sits in driver's seat, thinking a moment. He looks to his right: the crumpled $20 bill still lies there, untouched since it was thrown there six hours previously.
TRAVIS reluctantly picks up the $20 bill and stuffs it into his jacket pocket as he gets out of the cab. He gathers up his time report and heads toward book-in table.
A SHORT WHILE LATER, TRAVIS is walking down the sidewalk near the taxi garage. His hands are in his jacket pockets, obscuring the slight bulge on his left side.
TRAVIS turns into the box offfice of PORNO THEATER. He reaches into jacket pocket for money to purchase ticket and pulls out crumpled $20 bill. Seeing the $20 bill, he decides not to use it, and pays for ticket out of his wallet instead.
TRAVIS walks past concession stand en route to the darkened theater auditorium. A YOUNG MAN is now sitting listlessly behind the concessions counter.
INT. PORNO THEATER AUDITORIUM
TRAVIS slouches down into his seat, his face glowing in the reflected light from the screen.
FEMALE MOVIE VOICE (O.S.) Oh, come on, now, down, lick it, come on... 
(a beat)
Mmm, that's good.	Ahh, ahh, more
... 
TRAVIS averts his eyes as the action on screen becomes too graphic.
62.
Placing his stiffened right hand beside his eyes, TRAVIS can, by turning it inward, shut off or open up his field of vision by small degrees.
MOVIE VOICE DIMINISHES, replaced by SOUND of TRAVIS' voice over.
TRAVIS (V.O.)
The idea had been growing in my
brain ... 
CUT TO:
TRACKING SHOT to wall of TRAVIS' APARTMENT. CAMERA MOVES slowly across wall covered with clippings, notes, maps, pictures. We now see their contents clearly:
The wall is covered with CHARLES PALANTINE political paraphernalia; there are pictures of him, newspaper articles, leaflets, bumper stickers. As the CAMERA MOVES along it discovers a sketch of Plaza Hotel, Kennedy Airport and cut- up sections of city maps with notations written in. There is lengthy N.Y. Times clipping detailing the increased Secret Security Protection during the primaries. A section pertaining to PALANTINE is underlined. Further along there is a sheet reading "traveling schedule" and a calendar for June with finely written notations written over the dates.
TRAVIS (V.O.)(CONTD)
...  for some time. True Force. All the king's men cannot put it back together again.
As the CAMERA reaches the end of its track, it finds TRAVIS, standing, his shirt open, but the mattress. He is wearing the empty holster, and the .44 is in his hand.
In the SHOTS that follow TRAVIS gives the audience a lesson in gunmanship:
TRAVIS practices fast-drawing the .38 Special from his holster and firing it.
He hooks the .44 into his pants behind his back and practices withdrawing it. He holds the .44 firmly at an arm's length, tightening his forearm muscles.
He has worked out a system of metal gliders taped to his inner forearm, whereby the Colt .25 can rest hidden behind the upper forearm until a spring near the elbow is activated, sending the .25 flying down the gliders into his palm. He has cut open his shirt to accomodate the gun mechanism and now checks in the mirror to see how well the gun is hidden.
63.
He straps an Army combat knife to his calf and cuts a slit in his jeans where the knife can be pulled out quickly.
He now tries on various combinations of shirts, sweater and jacket in front of the mirror to see how well he can hide all the handguns he wishes to carry. Finally, wearing two western shirts, a sweater and jacket, he manages to obscure the location of all three guns, although he resembles a hunter bundled up against the Arctic winter.
He sits at the table dum-dumming the .44 bullets -- cutting "x's" across the bullet heads.
P.O.V.: he scans the objects of his room through the scope of the .38.
TRAVIS stands in the middle of his apartment, staring at his PALANTINE wall. His eyes are glazed with introspection; he sees nothing but himself.
TRAVIS (V.O.)(CONTD)
Listen you screwheads: Here is a
man ... 
TRAVIS lies on his mattress, all bundled up in his shirts, sweater, jacket and guns. His face is turned toward the ceiling, but his eyes are closed. Although the room is flooded with light, he is finally catching some sleep.
The big furry animal drifts into his own world.
TRAVIS (V.O.)(CONTD) ...  who wouldn't take it any more, a man who stood up against the scum, the cunts, the dogs, the filth. Here is ... 
(voice trails off)
C.U. of diary: entry ends with words "Here is" followed by erratic series of dots.
CUT TO:
NIGHT: the taxis are roaming the slick streets.
Sometimes after 2:00 a.m., TRAVIS pulls his cab to the curb near an all-night delicatessen in Spanish Harlem. The streets are relatively deserted.
TRAVIS waves to STOREKEEPER as he walks past counter:
TRAVIS
Hey 'Melio.
64.
Spanish rhythm and blues blares from a cheap radio.
TRAVIS walks over to dairy counter in rear of store, picks out a pint of chocolate milk, goes over to the open cooler and picks through various chilled prepackaged sandwiches. He overhears a VOICE as he looks at the sandwiches.
When TRAVIS returns to the counter with the chocolate milk and a sandwich in one hand, he sees a YOUNG BLACK MAN holding a gun on 'Melio. The STICK-UP MAN is nervous, hopped-up, or both; he bounces on the balls of his cheap worn black tennis shoes -- a strung-out junkie on a desperation ride. The STICK-UP MAN, a thorough unprofessional, doesn't notice TRAVIS.
'MELIO watches the STICK-UP MAN closely, deciding what to do himself.
STICK-UP MAN
(shaking gun)
Come on, man.	Quick, quick, quick.
Hand over that bread.
It doesn't take TRAVIS long to decide what to do: without hesitation he pulls his .32 from his jacket pocket.
TRAVIS
Hey dude!
The STICK-UP MAN, surprised, turns toward TRAVIS, finding only an exploding .32. The MAN's lower jaw bursts open with blood as he reels and crashes to the floor. There is no emotion on TRAVIS' face.
As the STICK-UP MAN falls, 'MELIO leans over the counter, wielding his battered .38. He is about to fire when he realizes the MAN is already dead.
'MELIO, charged up, turns his gun toward TRAVIS, then, realizing the danger is over, lowers it again.
'MELIO
Thanks, man. Figured I'd get him on the way out.
TRAVIS sets his .32 on the counter.
TRAVIS
You're gonna have to cover me on this one, 'Melio. I can't stay for the cop show.
65.
'MELIO
You can't do that, Travis. You're my witness.
TRAVIS
The hell I can't.	It's no sweat
for you.	What is this for you,
number five?
'MELIO smiles and holds up four fingers:
'MELIO
No, only four.
(shrug)
Alright, Travis, I'll do what I
can.
TRAVIS
Thanks a lot.
TRAVIS exits.	'MELIO picks up the phone and starts dialing.
The bloody BODY lies on the floor unmoving.
TRAVIS, still carrying his pint of chocolate milk and sandwich, walks down the empty sidewalk and enters his cab. The street is deserted.
CUT TO:
DIRECT CUT TO PORNOGRAPHIC MOVIE: this is the first time we have actually seen the porno movie itself.
SEVERAL ACTORS and ACTRESSES are dallying on screen in whatever manner the ratings board deems permissible.
Whatever the action, the movie's decor is strictly Zody's -- ersatz landscape paintings, tufted bedspreads. As in most porno films, the ACTORS look up occasionally toward the CAMERA to receive instructions. Studio grunts, groans and moans of pleasure have been dubbed in.
Action on screen begins to go into SLOW MOTION, the ACTORS and ACTRESSES gradually transforming obscenity into poetry.
CUT TO:
TRAVIS, sitting in his chair in his APARTMENT, watching afternoon soap opera. He is cleaning his .38 and eating from a jar of applesauce. Soap opera audio continues.
He watches the soap opera without expression.
66.
SOUND TRACK of film also SLOWS DOWN, gradually mixing with and then becoming the sound track of a midafternoon TV soap opera.
A YOUNG GIRL and BOY are talking in those familiar soap opera voices and a third party, the GIRL's mother, who had tried to terminate their "relationship."
CUT TO:
TELEVISION: The BOY is visiting the GIRL in her hospital room. Both look as if they've stepped out of the Blue Chip stamp catalogue.
SOAP OPERA BOY
Is it that she just doesn't -- like me?
SOAP OPERA GIRL
(hesitantly)
Well, Jim, it's just that -- I don't know how to say this -- it's that she thinks your parents aren't...  good enough, I guess.
TRAVIS, through cleaning his gun, begins to play a game with the television set.
He places the heel of his boot at the top of the melon crate which supports the TV. Then, slowly rocking his heel back and forth, he sees how far he can tip the melon crate without knocking it over.
The TV, still broadcasting the hospital room melodrama, rocks back and forth.
TRAVIS pushes the TV farther and farther until finally the inevitable happens -- the crate tips backward, sending the portable TV crashing to the floor.
There is a short flash and the TV screen turns white.
TRAVIS, realizing what he has done, bends over, turns the TV upright on the floor, fiddles with the knobs, slaps it, and tries to reactivate the vanished image. TRAVIS' efforts are futile; a tube has broken, and the TV will not come back to life.
TRAVIS
(to himself)
Damn, damn.
67.
TRAVIS bends over in the chair and places his head in his hands, despairing of himself.
FADE TO:
About 1 a.m. TRAVIS pulls his cab behind a line of empty taxis parked outside the Bellmore Cafeteria, a cabbie hangout on Park Avenue South.
He locks his cab and walks past the line of taxis. He sidesteps TWO DRUNKEN FIGHTING BUMS and enters the Bellmore.
A LOUD BUZZER RINGS as TRAVIS steps INTO THE BELLMORE. He pulls a ticket from the dispenser (silencing the buzzer) and walks toward the wall-length counter.
An assortment of CABBIES are seated around a formica-topped table near the rear of the cafeteria. Some are barely awake, some are eating, the rest are swapping stories and smalltalk.
Wizard, Dough-Boy, Charlie T and a FOURTH CABBIE are seated at a long table.
WIZARD
You know Eddie, he's the new hippie kid in our group, long hair... 
Wizard demonstrates length of hair and others nod.
WIZARD
... he called up the Dispatcher last night. Charlie McCall, our dispatcher... 
DOUGH-BOY
One-Ball McCall?
WIZARD
That's the guy. Eddie calls him up and says, "Hey, what do you want me to do. I'm over here at Poly Prep. I got a girl in the back and she doesn't have the fare. She wants me to come in back and collect. What should I do?
The cabbies laugh. Across the cafeteria Travis selects a cup of coffee and some pastries.
CHARLIE T
This is on the two-way with about a hundred and fifty cars listenin in.
68.
WIZARD
McCall says. "How much on the meter?" Eddie comes back and says "Two-fifty." McCall says, "Is she worth it".
More laughter.
DOUGH-BOY
Fuckin One-Ball.
WIZARD
And the kid says, "Yeah.	She's
about 19, good-lookin."	McCall
says, "What can I tell you?"
FOURTH CABBIE
She should have told him to get an OK from the front office.
(laughter)
WIZARD
McCall says, "Well, if you want
some help I'll see if I can send
some units out."
CHARLIE T
Yeah.	About a hundred and fifty.
DOUGH-BOY
I hope he had a checker.
WIZARD
She was just a kid.	Stoned, you
know.
Travis, carrying his coffee and pastries, walks over to their table. Charlie T spots him.
CHARLIE T
Hiya Killer.
Charlie forms his hand into a pistol, cocks and fires, making the SOUND, "Pgghew." TRAVIS nods.
WIZARD
You're getting a rep, Travis.
TRAVIS sits down and the other CABBIES resume their conversation.
CHARLIE T
Got the five you owe me, Killer?
69.
TRAVIS reaches into his pocket and pulls out a roll of small denomination bills. The crumpled $20 bill falls onto the table. TRAVIS stares at it a moment. He unfolds a five, gives it to CHARLIE T, then picks up the crumpled $20 and puts it back into his jacket pocket.
WIZARD (O.S.)
(to Travis)
What's the action around?
TRAVIS
Slow.
CHARLIE T
Shit yes. Night woulda been dead if I hadn't grabbed an outatowner at Kennedy. Took him roun the horn and got a five dollar tip to boot.
WIZARD
(joking)
One of these days we're gonna turn you in, Charlie T. Fleecin the hicks like that.
DOUGH-BOY
Remember the time this cat picks up four dudes from the other side, Pakastanis I think they were, holds up their passports, to the toll booth collector on the bridge and charges em ten bucks each for 'crossing the border?
They all laugh.
CHARLIE T
Hell, I know'd you to do worse.
DOUGH-BOY
Least I'm no airport rat. I work the whole town.
CHARLIE T
(chuckling)
It's a living.
WIZARD gets up to leave.
WIZARD
Well, I'm shovin' on.
WIZARD gets up, nods and walks toward the CASHIER. After a second's thought, TRAVIS calls to him:
70.
TRAVIS
Hey Wiz, just a second.	I wanna
talk to you.
WIZARD waits for TRAVIS as he takes a final gulp of coffee and catches up with him. CHARLIE T calls to TRAVIS as they go:
CHARLIE T
See ya, Killer. Don't forget your pea shooter.
CHARLIE T cocks his imaginary gun again, fires and chuckles.
WIZARD and TRAVIS nod goodbye, pay the CASHIER and exit.
EXT.
TRAVIS follows WIZARD out onto the sidewalk. TRAVIS follows WIZARD as he walks toward his cab. He has something on his mind, something he wants to talk to WIZARD about.
TRAVIS
(walking)
Hey Wiz.
WIZARD leans back against the cab. TRAVIS is about to speak when he spots a GROUP of BLACK and PUERTO RICAN STREET PUNKS, ages 12-15, jiving down the sidewalk toward him. ONE tosses a spray paint can around his back, basketball style. ANOTHER mocks as if he's going to scratch a key along one of the cabs.
WIZARD has no visible reaction. A flash of controlled anger crosses TRAVIS' face. He stares at the BOY with the poised key. It is the same look that crossed his face in the Harlem Deli. We are reminded with a jolt that the killer lies just beneath TRAVIS' surface.
The BLACK PUNK must instinctively realize this too, because he makes a cocky show of putting the key back into his pocket and be-bopping around TRAVIS and WIZARD.
The YOUNG MEAN-STREETERS continue down the street and TRAVIS turns back to WIZARD.
Across the street, in the background, a JUNKIE nestles in a doorway.
TRAVIS
(hesitant)
Wiz?
71.
WIZARD
Yeah?
TRAVIS
Look, ah, we never talked much, you and me... 
WIZARD
Yeah?
TRAVIS
I wanted to ask you something, on account you've been around so long.
WIZARD
Shoot.	They don't call me the
Wizard for nothing.
TRAVIS
Well, I just, you know... 
WIZARD
Things got ya down?
TRAVIS
Real down.
WIZARD
It happens.
TRAVIS
Sometimes it gets so I just don't know what I'm gonna do. I get some real crazy ideas, you know? Just go out and do somethin.
WIZARD
The taxi life, you mean.
TRAVIS
Yeah.
WIZARD
(nods)
I know.
TRAVIS
Like do anything, you know.
WIZARD
Travis, look, I dig it. Let me explain. You choose a certain way of life. You live it. It becomes what you are.
72.
I've been a hack 27 years, the last ten at night. Still don't own my own cab. I guess that's the way I want it. You see, that must be what I am.
A police car stops across the street. TWO PATROLMEN get out and roust the JUNKIE from his doorway.
WIZARD
(continuing)
Look, a person does a certain thing and that's all there is to it. It becomes what he is. Why fight it? What do you know? How long you been a hack, a couple months? You're like a peg and you get dropped into a slot and you got to squirm and wiggle around a while until you fit in.
TRAVIS
(pause)
That's just about the dumbest thing I ever heard, Wizard.
WIZARD
What do you expect, Bertrand Russell? I've been a cabbie all my life, what do I know?
(a beat)
I don't even know what you're
talking about.
TRAVIS
Neither do I, I guess.
WIZARD
You fit in.	It's lonely, it's
rough at first.	But you fit in.
You got no choice.
WIZARD
Yeah.	Sorry, Wizard.
WIZARD
Don't worry, Killer. You'll be all right.
(a beat)
I seen enough to know.
TRAVIS
Thanks.
73.
WIZARD gives TRAVIS a short wave implying, "Chin up, old boy," and walks around to the driver's side of his cab.
WIZARD drives off, leaving the street to its natural inhabitants.
CUT TO:
FADE IN:
EXT. CHARLES PALANTINE RALLY - DAY
A rally platform in a supermarket parking lot somewhere in QUEENS is draped in red, white and blue bunting.
A CROWD of about 500 persons mills about, waiting for the rally to begin. Piped pop-country MUSIC plays over the loudspeaker system.
The CADRE OF SECRET SERVICE MEN, with their distinctive metallic grey suits, sun glasses and football physiques, stands out in the CROWD.
On the PLATFORM are seated an assortment of LOCAL POLITICOS as well as some PALANTINE WORKERS and ADVISERS.
TOM is silently reading something on the podium, and BETSY stands on the platform steps talking with ANOTHER WORKER.
TOM looks up and to his left for a moment, then returns to what he was reading. Then he returns his gaze to the upper left, watching something very closely.
After a moment he walks over to the steps where BETSY is standing.
TOM
Betsy, come over here a moment.
BETSY
What is it?	I'm busy.
TOM
(insistent)
Just follow me.
BETSY excuses herself and walks across the platform with TOM. As they stand to the rear of the platform, TOM secretively makes a gesture with his eyes and says out of the side of his mouth:
TOM
Look there.
(her eyes follow his)
74.
No, over further - get your glasses
-	yes, over there.  Isn't that
little guy the same guy that was bugging you around the office about a month ago?
BETSY, putting on her glasses, looks closely. She tries not to make her stare too obvious.
BETSY
No, I don't think so.
(a beat)
That's someone else.
TOM
Now look more closely. Look around the eyes and chin. See? See there?
CAMERA CLOSES IN on TRAVIS BICKLE standing in the CROWD: he has shaved his head to a short stubble. There he is: brush-cut, wearing a giant grin, and a large "Palantine '72" button.
Although it is a pleasant sunny day, TRAVIS wears a bulky bulged-out Army jacket.
TRAVIS looks warily from side to side and vanishes in the
CROWD.
A SHORT WHILE LATER, TRAVIS walks up to a SECRET SERVICE MAN standing near the fringes of the CROWD. The SECRET SERVICE MAN -- in sun glasses, grey suit, ever-roving eyes -- is immediately identifiable.
Whenever TRAVIS confronts a symbol of authority, he becomes like a young boy. This time is no exception, although one suspects there is a plan hatching beneath that boyish exterior. The SECRET SERVICE MAN, for his part, is about as talkative as the Sphinx.
TRAVIS
Are you a Secret Service Man?
SECRET SERVICE MAN
(indifferently)
Why do you ask?
TRAVIS
I've seen a lot of suspicious-looking people around here today.
SECRET SERVICE MAN glances at TRAVIS momentarily.
75.
SECRET SERVICE MAN
Who?
TRAVIS
Oh, lots. I don't know where they all are now. There used to be one standing over there.
(points)
SECRET SERVICE MAN's gaze follows TRAVIS' finger for a second, then return to TRAVIS.
TRAVIS (CONTD)
Is it hard to get to be a Secret
Service Man?
SECRET SERVICE MAN
Why?
TRAVIS
I kinda thought I might make a good one. I'm very observant.
SECRET SERVICE MAN
Oh?
TRAVIS
I was in the Army too.
(beat)
And I'm good with crowds.
The SECRET SERVICE MAN is starting to get interested in TRAVIS: he definitely ranks as a suspicious character.
SECRET SERVICE MAN
Is that so?
TRAVIS
What kind of guns do you guys use?
.38's?
The SECRET SERVICE MAN decides it's time to get some more information on TRAVIS:
SECRET SERVICE MAN Look, um, if you give me your name and address, we'll send you the information on how to apply.
TRAVIS
You would, huh?
76.
SECRET SERVICE MAN
(taking out notepad)
Sure.
TRAVIS
My name is Henry Krinkle -- that's with a "K." K-R-I-N-K-L-E. I live at 13 1/2 Hopper Avenue, Fair Lawn, New Jersey. Zip code 07410.
(a beat)
Got that?
SECRET SERVICE MAN Sure, Henry. I got it all. We'll send you all the stuff all right.
TRAVIS
Great, hey.	Thanks a lot.
The SECRET SERVICE MAN motions to a SECRET SERVICE PHOTOGRAPHER to catch a picture of TRAVIS. TRAVIS notices this, and quickly slips away into the CROWD.
CUT TO:
TRAVIS sits at his desk in his APARTMENT, writing. He wears jeans, western shirt and empty holster.
TRAVIS (V.O.)
June 11. Eight rallies in six more days. The time is coming.
CUT TO:
NIGHT. TRAVIS' taxi picks up a FARE in the midtown area and heads downtown.
LOWER EAST SIDE. TRAVIS lets off FARE on B Street and cuts across toward Tompkins Square.
TRAVIS turns the corner when SKREETCH! he suddenly hits the brakes, causing the cab to rock back and forth.
He has almost hit a YOUNG GIRL recklessly crossing the street. She thumps her hand on the taxi hood to regain her balance and stares in shock through the front window. C.U. GIRL's face.
TRAVIS recognizes her face: it's IRIS, the GIRL in his taxi a week or so before. IRIS looks at TRAVIS sharply then turns and continues walking.
77.
TRAVIS' eyes follow her and she rejoins a GIRLFRIEND. They are both dressed as hippie hookers: sloppy clothes, boots, jeans, floppy hats. And the old come-hither walk is unmistakable.
TRAVIS follows IRIS and her GIRLFRIEND slowly as they walk down the sidewalk.
TRAVIS' P.O.V. He examines them from bottom to top -- boots, legs, thighs, breasts, faces, hats.
As TRAVIS rolls astride the GIRLS, he notices the familiar FRINGE OF A SUEDE JACKET standing in the shadows. The GIRLS look toward the SHADOWED FIGURE, smile, acknowledge some unheard comment, and continue on.
IRIS looks back uneasily at TRAVIS' taxi and continues on.
On the corner stand TWO well-to-do COLLEGE STUDENTS, somewhat out of place in this environment, but making every attempt to groove on it. They are high on something or another.
The GIRLS spot the COLLEGE STUDENTS and walk over to them. They exchange some small talk and walk off together. There is little subtlety involved: it is obviously a pick-up.
TRAVIS must negotiate a turn around the corner if he is to continue following the GIRLS and their COLLEGIATE JOHNS. This is not so easy, since the traffic is heavy.
As TRAVIS slows down to make the turn, he notices ANOTHER HIPPIE HOOKER who had been watching him watching IRIS and her GIRLFRIEND. She walks over to the taxi, loans in the open left front window and gives TRAVIS the come-on disguised as an innocent question:
C.U. HIPPIE HOOKER.
HIPPIE HOOKER
Hey cabbie!	You comin' or goin'?
TRAVIS quickly turns his face away from her in a combination of shock, embarrassment and revulsion. He is the child caught with his hand in the cookie jar. The very presence of this crassly, openly sexual human being frightens and sickens him.
TRAVIS takes off with a skreetch. His taxi shoots down the block.
CUT TO:
78.
A HOT JUNE DAY. TRAVIS' taxi, the "Off Duty" sign on, is parked against the curb somewhere in HARLEM. WHITE COPS, SECRET SERVICE MEN and REPORTERS, punctuate the otherwise BLACK CROWDS which walk to and fro in the b.g.
CHARLES PALANTINE's voice can be heard coming from a distant loudspeaker system. It is a political rally.
TRAVIS sits behind the wheel, coldly staring at something in the distance. His hair, of course, is still clipped short and he wears mirror-reflecting sunglasses. Even though a drop of sweat is working its way down his cheek, TRAVIS wears his Army jacket with the bulge on the left side -- the .38 Smith and Wesson bulge.
A BLOCK AWAY, PALANTINE stands on a platform outside his uptown campaign headquarters. On the platform sit an array of BLACK DIGNITARIES. Nearby we recognize the SECRET SERVICE MAN TRAVIS spoke to at the earlier rally: he scans the CROWD anxiously.
PALANTINE is speaking animatedly. He is an excellent speaker and captures our attention. He drives hard toward his arguments, crashes down on his points. His strained voice rings with sincerity and anger.
C.U. of PALANTINE as he speaks. He is dressed in rolled-up shirtsleeves and sweat pours down his face.
PALANTINE
The time has come to put an end to the things that divide us: racism, poverty, way -- and to those persons who seek to divide us. Never have I seen such a group of high officials from the President to Senate leaders to Cabinet members... 
CUT TO TRAVIS: no expression. PALANTINE's words are barely distinguishable from a block away:
PALANTINE
(in distance)
...  pit black against white, young against old, sow anger, disunity and suspicion -- and all in the name of the "good of the country." Well, their game is over.
(applause)
All their games are over. Now is the time to stand up against such foolishness, propaganda and demagoguery.
79.
Now is the time for one man to stand up and accept his neighbor, for one man to give in order that all might receive. Is unity and love of common good such a lost thing?
ALL LIVE SOUND CEASES as TRAVIS' narration begins. He is reading from a letter or card he has just written.
As he speaks we see SHOTS of PALANTINE speaking, a seated row of YOUNG BLACK PALANTINE red, white and blue bedecked CHEERLEADERS, SECRET SERVICE AGENTS examining the CROWD and so forth. These SHOTS have no direct relationship to the narration.
TRAVIS (V.O.)
(reading)
Dear Father and Mother, June is the month, I remember, which brings not only your wedding anniversary, but also Father's Day and Mother's birthday. I'm sorry I can't remember the exact dates, but I hope this card will take care of all of them.
I'm sorry I again can not send you my address like I promised to last year, but the sensitive nature of my work for the Army demands utmost secrecy. I know you will understand. I am healthy and well and making lots of money. I have been going with a girl for several months and I know you would be proud if you could see her.
TRAVIS (V.O.; CONT'D) Her name is Betsy, but I can tell you no more than that.
(interrupted)
As TRAVIS reads third paragraph, a POLICEMAN is seen walking from behind TRAVIS' taxi to his window.
The POLICEMAN's voice come during a pause in the narration.
LIVE SOUND RESUMES.
POLICEMAN
(standing near window)
Hey, cabbie, you can't park here.
TRAVIS
(penitent)
Sorry, officer.
80.
POLICEMAN
You waiting for a fare?
POLICEMAN leans his head in window, inspecting the cab. As he does, TRAVIS slides his right hand into the left side of his jacket, ready to draw his revolver.
TRAVIS
No, officer.
POLICEMAN
All right, move it.
TRAVIS starts up his taxi and drives off.
LIVE SOUND again CEASES as TRAVIS resumes reading letter as taxi drives away.
As TRAVIS reads final paragraph, scene CUTS TO INT.
APARTMENT where TRAVIS sits at his table.
TRAVIS (V.O.)
(resuming reading)
I hope this card finds you all well, as it does me. I hope no one has died. Don't worry about me. One day there will be a knock on the door and it will be me.
Love, Travis.
TRAVIS, at his desk, examines the card upon which he has just written this letter.
C.U. cover of card. It is a 25¬¢ Wedding Anniversary card with a four-color embossed cover. The design could only be described as ur-kitsch. A cartoon Mr. and Mrs. All-America stand before an outdoor barbecuing grill, clicking salt and pepper shakers in a toast. Sentiment reads:
HAPPY ANNIVERSARY
To a Couple
Who Have Found the Perfect Combination For Marriage... 
The card opens to read:
LOVE!
Underneath the word "Love!" begins TRAVIS' short message to his parents, a message which extends to the back cover of the card.
CUT TO:
81.
NIGHT on the LOWER EAST SIDE. TRAVIS sits parked in the dark shadows of a side street. The lone wolf waits.
TRAVIS watches the SLUM GODDESSES as they work the section of the street reserved for hippie hookers.
TRAVIS' P.O.V.: some of the YOUNG STREET GIRLS are arrogant, almost aggressive, others are more insecure and inexperienced.
A BLACK MAN charges down the sidewalk across the street from TRAVIS. He walks at a fast, maniacal clip, looking only at the sidewalk in front of him. Out of his mouth comes a continuous stream of invective: "That-cock-sucking-crazy-no-good-asshole-bitch-when-I-get-my-fucking-fingers-on-her-nigger-tits-I'm-gonna-ring-em-and-shit-up-her-ass... " and so on. He is Out of Control. Nobody seems to notice or care.
TRAVIS takes a swig of peach brandy and continues his stake-out.
Finally, TRAVIS spies the object of his search: IRIS walks down the sidewalk with her GIRLFRIEND. Iris wears her large blue sunglasses.
TRAVIS checks to see if his .38 is in place (it is), opens the door and exits from the cab.
Flipping up the collar of his Army jacket, TRAVIS slouches over and walks toward IRIS. He sort of sidles up next to her and walks beside her: TRAVIS always looks most suspicious when he's trying to appear innocent.
TRAVIS
(shy)
Hello.
IRIS
You looking for some action?
TRAVIS
Well... I guess so.
IRIS
(eyeing him)
All right.
(a beat)
You see that guy over there?
(nods)
His name is Sport.	Go talk to him.
I'll wait here.
82.
Travis' eyes follow Iris' nod until they reach Sport, standing in a doorway in his lime green jacket. Travis walks toward him.
Sport, a thirtiesh white greaser, has the affections of a black pimp. His hips are jiving, his fingers softly snapping. He sings to him self, "Going to the chapel, gonna get married... " His complexion is sallow; his eyes cold and venal. He could only seem romantic to a confused underaged runaway.
TRAVIS
You name Sport?
Sport immediately takes Travis for an undercover cop. He extends his crosses wrists as if to be handcuffed.
SPORT
Here, officer, take me in. I'm clean. I didn't do it. Got a ticket once in Jersey. That's all. Honest, officer.
TRAVIS
Your name Sport?
SPORT
Anything you say, officer.
TRAVIS
I'm no cop.
(looks back at Iris)
I want some action.
SPORT
I saw. $20 fifteen minutes. $30 half hour.
TRAVIS
Shit.
SPORT
Take it or leave it.
TRAVIS digs in his pocket for money.
SPORT
No, not me. There'll be an elderly gent to take the bread.
TRAVIS turns to walk away.
SPORT
Catch you later, Copper.
83.
TRAVIS freezes, not saying anything.	He turns back toward
SPORT.
TRAVIS
I'm no cop.
SPORT
Well, if you are, it's entrapment already.
TRAVIS
I'm hip.
SPORT
Funny, you don't look hip.
(laughs)
TRAVIS walks back to IRIS.
IRIS motions for TRAVIS to follow her and he does.
IRIS and TRAVIS turn the corner and walk about a block, saying nothing. IRIS turns into a darkened doorway and TRAVIS follows her.
At the top of the dark stairs IRIS and TRAVIS enter a dimly lit hallway. On either side are doors with apartment numbers. IRIS turns toward the first door, No. 2.
IRIS
This is my room.
At the far end of the darkened corridor sits a huge OLD MAN. His face is obscured by shadow. TRAVIS is about to enter the room when the OLD MAN speaks up:
OLD MAN
Hey cowboy!
TRAVIS turns his head toward the OLD MAN who has stood up and is advancing toward him.
OLD MAN
(motioning to TRAVIS'
jacket)
The rod.
(a beat)
Gimme the rod, cowboy.
TRAVIS hesitates a moment, uncertain what to do. The OLD MAN reaches in TRAVIS' jacket and pulls out the .38 Special.
84.
OLD MAN
This ain't Dodge City, cowboy. You don't need no piece.
(glances at watch)
I'm keepin' time.
TRAVIS enters No. 2 with IRIS.
TRAVIS looks around IRIS' room: although dimly lit, the room is brightly decorated. There is an orange shag carpet, deep brown walls and an old red velvet sofa. On the walls are posters of Mick Jagger, Bob Dylan and Peter Fonda. A Neil Young album is playing on a small phonograph.
This is where IRIS lives: it bears the individual touch of a young girl.
IRIS lights a cigarette, takes a single puff and places it in an ashtray on the bedstand.
TRAVIS
Why you hang around with them
greasers?
IRIS
A girl needs protection.
TRAVIS
Yeah.	From the likes of them.
IRIS
(shrugs)
It's your time mister.	Fifteen
minutes ain't long.
(gestures to cigarette)
That cigarette burns out, your time is up.
IRIS sits on the edge of the bed and removes her hat and coat. She takes off her blue-tinted sunglasses--her last defense. Without the paraphernalia of adulthood, Iris looks like a little girl she is. About 14, 15.
TRAVIS
What's your name?
IRIS
Easy.
TRAVIS
That ain't much of a name.
IRIS
It's easy to remember.	Easy Lay.
85.
TRAVIS
What's your real name?
IRIS
I don't like my real name.
TRAVIS
(insistent)
What's your real name?
IRIS
Iris.
TRAVIS
That's a nice name.
IRIS
That's what you think.
IRIS unbuttons her shirt, revealing her small pathetic breasts -- two young doves hiding from a winter wind. TRAVIS is unnerved by her partial nudity.
TRAVIS
Don't you remember me? Button your shirt.
IRIS buttons only the bottom button of her shirt.
IRIS
(examining him)
Why?	Who are you?
TRAVIS
I drive a taxi. You tried to get away one night. Remember?
IRIS
No.
TRAVIS
You tried to run away in my taxi
but your friend -- Sport --
wouldn't let you.
IRIS
I don't remember.
TRAVIS
It don't matter. I'm gonna get you outta here.
(looks toward door)
86.
IRIS
We better make it, or Sport'll get mad. How do you want to make it?
TRAVIS
(pressured)
I don't want to make it.	I came
here to get you out.
IRIS
You want to make it like this?
(goes for his fly)
TRAVIS pushes her hand away. He sits beside her on the edge of the bed.
TRAVIS
(taking her by the
shoulders)
Can't you listen to me? Don't you want to get out of here?
IRIS
Why should I want to get out of
here?	This is where I live.
TRAVIS
(exasperated)
But you're the one that wanted to get away. You're the one that came into my cab.
IRIS
I musta been stoned.
TRAVIS
Do they drug you?
IRIS
(reproving)
Oh, come off it, man.
IRIS tries to unzip TRAVIS' fly. This only unnerves TRAVIS more: sexual contact is something he's never really confronted.
TRAVIS
Listen... 
IRIS
Don't you want to make it?
(a beat)
Can't you make it?
87.
IRIS works on TRAVIS' crotch OFF CAMERA. He bats her hand away.
TRAVIS
(distraught)
I want to help you.
TRAVIS is getting increasingly panicked, but IRIS only thinks this is part of his particular thing and tries to overcome it.
IRIS
(catching on)
You can't make it, can you?
(a beat)
I can help you.
