IRIS lowers her head to go down on TRAVIS. TRAVIS, seeing this, jumps up in panic.
TRAVIS stands several feet from IRIS. His fly is still open, and the white of his underwear shows through his jeans. He is starting to come apart.
TRAVIS
Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it!
IRIS
(confused)
You can do it in my mouth.
TRAVIS
Don't you understand anything?
IRIS says nothing. After a moment, TRAVIS again sits on the bed beside IRIS. She no longer tries to make him.
There is a moment of silence. IRIS puts her arm around his shoulder.
IRIS
You don't have to make it, mister.
TRAVIS rests a moment, collecting himself. Finally, he says:
TRAVIS
(slowly)
Do you understand why I came here?
88.
IRIS
I think so.	I tried to get into
your cab one night, and now you
want to come and take me away.
TRAVIS
Don't you want to go?
IRIS
I can leave anytime I want.
TRAVIS
But that one night?
IRIS
I was stoned. That's why they stopped me. When I'm not stoned, I got no place else to go. They just protect me from myself.
There is a pause. TRAVIS smiles and shrugs apologetically. TRAVIS looks at Iris' cigarette. It's burning down to the butt.
TRAVIS
Well, I tried.
IRIS
(compassionate)
I understand, mister.	It means
something, really.
TRAVIS
(getting up)
Can I see you again?
IRIS
That's not hard to do.
TRAVIS
No, I mean really. This is nothing for a person to do.
IRIS
Sure.	All right.	We'll have
breakfast.	I get up about one
o'clock.	Tomorrow.
TRAVIS
(thinking)
Well tomorrow noon there's a...  I got a... 
IRIS is interfering with TRAVIS' assassination schedule.
89.
IRIS
Well, you want to or not?
TRAVIS
(deciding)
O.K. It's a date.	I'll see you
here, then.
TRAVIS turns; IRIS smiles.
TOM
Oh, Iris?
IRIS
Yes?
TOM
My name's Travis.
IRIS
Thank you, Travis.
TRAVIS
So long, Iris.
(a beat)
Sweet Iris.
(smiles)
TRAVIS exits.
TRAVIS closes the door to No. 2 and stands in the corridor for a moment.
The OLD MAN slowly walks from the dark end of the hallway with TRAVIS' .38 in his hand. OLD MAN stands near TRAVIS, and checks his watch.
OLD MAN
(holding gun)
I think this is yours, cowboy.
TRAVIS reaches in his jacket pocket and pulls out the familiar crumpled $20 bill. He makes a big show of stuffing the wrinkled bill into the OLD MAN's hand. The OLD MAN doesn't understand the significance of it.
TRAVIS
(restrained anger)
Here's the twenty bucks, old man. You better damn well spend it right.
TRAVIS turns and walks away.
OLD MAN says as TRAVIS walks down stairs:
90.
OLD MAN
Come back anytime you want, cowboy.
But without the rod -- please.
TRAVIS does not respond.
CUT TO:
INT. ST. REGIS SUITE NOON
Palantine, Tom and Palantine's Assistant are seated in garishly decorated suite.
ASSISTANT
Well, at least it wasn't chicken.
PALANTINE
It wasn't? I thought it was. It tasted like chicken.
TOM
C'mon, Senator. That was a class dinner. The St. Regis is a class joint. That was veal.
PALANTINE
Was it?	It sure tasted like
chicken to me.
(a beat)
Lately, everything tastes like
chicken to me.
ASSISTANT
Everything?	Got to watch your gut.
PALANTINE
What about it?	I took 20 off
before we started this thing.
ASSISTANT
And you've put ten of it back on.
PALANTINE
Ten? I don't think so. You really think so? Ten?
TOM
Those TV cameras do. I caught the rally on CBS. You looked a little paunchy.
PALANTINE
I don't think I gained ten pounds.
91.
Palantine gets up and walks over to the window. Its bars form a cross-sight on his head. He thinks to himself:
PALANTINE
(weary)
Jesus Christ.
He looks at the crowded traffic on Fifth Avenue eighteen floors below. It is a mass of yellow.
CUT TO:
EXT. FIFTH AVE NOON
Travis' cab pulls away from the yellow mass and heads downtown.
CUT TO:
EXT. DOWNTONE COFFEE SHOP NOON
Travis' cab is parked near a neighborhood Bickford's.
CUT TO:
TRAVIS and IRIS are having late breakfast at a middle-class EAST SIDE COFFEE SHOP. It is about 1:30 P.M.
IRIS is dressed more sensibly, wearing jeans and a maroon sweater. Her face is freshly washed and her hair combed out.
Seen this way, IRIS looks no different than any young girl in the big city. OTHER PATRONS of the coffee shop most likely assume she is having lunch with her big brother.
They are both having an All-American breakfast: ham and eggs, large glasses of orange juice, coffee.
Outside here environment, Iris seems the more pathetic. She seems unsure, schizy, unable to hold a subject for more than thirty seconds. Her gestures are too broad, her voice too mannered. We sympathize with Travis' paternal respect. This girl is in trouble.
IRIS
...  and after that Sport and I just started hanging out... 
TRAVIS
Where is home?
Iris removes her large blue-tinted sunglasses and fishes through her bag for another pair.
92.
IRIS
I got so many sunglasses.	I
couldn't live without my shades,
man.	I must have twelve pair of
shades.
She finds a pink-tinted pair and puts them on.
TRAVIS
Where?
IRIS
Pittsburgh.
TRAVIS
I ain't ever been there, but it don't seem like such a bad place.
IRIS
(voice rising)
Why do you want me to go back to my parents? They hate me. Why do you think I split? There ain't nothin there.
TRAVIS
But you can't live like this. It's hell. Girls should live at home.
IRIS
(playfully)
Didn't you ever hear of women's
lib?
There is a short, quick silence; TRAVIS' eyes retract. He goes on:
TRAVIS
(ignoring her question)
Young girls are supposed to dress up, go to school, play with boys, you know, that kinda stuff.
Iris places a large gob of jam on her unbuttered toast and folds the bread over like a hotdog.
IRIS
God, you are square.
TRAVIS
(releasing pent-up
tension)
93.
At least I don't walk the streets like a skunk pussy. I don't screw and fuck with killers and junkies.
IRIS motions him to lower his voice.
IRIS
Who's a killer?
TRAVIS
That fella "Sport" looks like a
killer to me.
IRIS
He never killed nobody.	He's a
Libra.
TRAVIS
Huh?
IRIS
I'm a Libra too. That's why we get along so well.
TRAVIS
He looks like a killer.
IRIS
I think Cancer's make the best
lovers.	My whole family are air
signs.
TRAVIS
He shoots dope too.
IRIS
What makes you so high and mighty? Did you ever look at your own eyeballs in a mirror. You don't get eyes like that from... 
TRAVIS
He's worse than an animal. Jail's too good for scum like that.
There is a brief silence. Iris mind continued to whirl at rpms. She seems to have three subjects on her mind at a time. She welcomes this opportunity to unburden herself.
IRIS
Rock music died in 1970, that's what I think. Before that it was fantastic. I can tell you that.
94.
Everybody was crashing, hanging out at the Fillmore. Me and my girlfriend Ann used to go up the fire escape, you know? It was unbelievable. Rock Stars everywhere. That Airplane--that's my group, man. All Libras. But now everybody's split or got sick or busted. I think I'll move to one of those communes in Vermont, you know? That's where all the smart ones went. I stayed here.
TRAVIS
I never been to a commune. I don't know. I saw pictures in a magazine, and it didn't look very clean to me.
IRIS
Why don't you come to a commune
with me?
TRAVIS
Me?	I could never go to a place
like that.
IRIS
Why not?
TRAVIS
(hesitant)
I...  I don't get along with people like that.
IRIS
You a scorpion? That's it. You're a scorpion. I can tell.
TRAVIS
Besides, I've got to stay here.
IRIS
Why?
TRAVIS
I've got something important to do.
I can't leave.
IRIS
What's so important?
95.
TRAVIS
I can't say -- it's top secret. I'm doing something for the Army. The cab thing is just part time.
IRIS
You a narc?
TRAVIS
Do I look like a narc?
IRIS
Yeah.
TRAVIS breaks out in his big infectious grin, and IRIS joins his laughter.
IRIS
God, I don't know who's weirder,
you or me.
TRAVIS
(pause)
What are you going to do about
Sport and that old bastard?
IRIS
Just leave'em. There's plenty of other girls.
TRAVIS
You just gonna leave 'em?
IRIS
(astonished)
What should I do?	Call the cops?
TRAVIS
Cops don't do nothin.
IRIS
Sport never treated me bad, honest.
Never beat me up once.
TRAVIS
You can't leave 'em to do the same to other girls. You should get rid of them.
IRIS
How?
96.
TRAVIS
(shrugs)
I don't know.	Just should, though.
(a beat)
Somebody should kill 'em. Nobody'd miss 'em.
IRIS
(taken back)
God. I know where they should have a commune for you. They should have a commune for you at Bellevue.
TRAVIS
(apologetic/sheepish)
I'm sorry, Iris.	I didn't mean
that.
IRIS
You're not much with girls, are
you?
TRAVIS
(thinks)
Well, Iris, I look at it this way. A lot of girls come into my cab, some of them very beautiful. And I figure all day long men have been after them: trying to touch them, talk to them, ask them out. And they hate it. So I figure the best I can do for them is not bother them at all. So I don't say a thing. I pretend I'm not even there. I figure they'll understand that and appreciate me for it.
It takes IRIS a moment to digest this pure example of negative thinking: I am loved to the extent I do not exist.
IRIS
Do you really think I should go to the commune?
TRAVIS
I think you should go home, but otherwise I think you should go. It would be great for you. You have to get away from here. The city's a sewer, you gotta get out of it.
97.
Mumbling something about her "shades" again, Iris fishes through her bag until she comes up with another 99¬¢ pair of sunglasses and puts them on. She likes these better, she decides.
IRIS
Sure you don't want to come with
me?
TRAVIS
I can't.	Otherwise, I would.
IRIS
I sure hate to go alone... 
TRAVIS
I'll give you the money to go. I don't want you to take any from those guys.
IRIS
You don't have to.
TRAVIS
I want to -- what else can I do
with my money?
(thinks)
You may not see me again--for a
while.
IRIS
What do you mean?
CLOSE on C.U. of TRAVIS:
TRAVIS
My work may take me out of New
York.
CUT TO:
IRIS' ROOM - DAY
Sport stands beside the bed.
SPORT
What's the matter, baby, don't you feel right?
Iris is wearing her blue-tinted shades.
IRIS
It's my stomach.	I got the flu.
98.
Sport puts his hand on her hips. He is slowly, carefully, smoothly manipulating her. It's the stone black hustle.
SPORT
Oh, baby, there ain't no flu. You know that, baby.
IRIS
Honest, Sport.
Sport puts some slow soul music on the stereo.
SPORT
You're just tired, baby. You just need your man. I am your man, you know. You are my woman. I wouldn't be nothing without you.
Sport slowly grinds his hips to hers. Iris starts to move with him. This is what she really wanted. Her man's attention.
SPORT
I know this may not mean anything to you, baby, but sometimes I get so emotional, sometimes I think, I wish every man could have what I have now, that every woman could be loved the way I love you. I go home and I think what it would be without you, and then I thank God for you. I think to myself, man, you are so lucky. You got a woman who loves you, who needs you, a woman who keeps you strong. It's just you and me. I'm nothing without you. I can go like this for ever and ever. We can do it, baby. You and me. Just you and me.
Sport slowly rubs his crotch into her. Iris smiles. She is happy. The music rises.
CUT TO:
FIRING RANGE - DAY
TRAVIS stands at the firing range blasting the .44 Magnum with a rapid-fire vengeance.
He sets down one gun, picks up the next, then the next.
Quickly reloading, he fires again.
99.
The targets spin and dance under his barrage. The piercing sound of GUNSHOTS ring through the air.
CUT TO:
INT. APARTMENT
TRAVIS is again writing at the table. His western shirt is open, exposing his bare chest.
A note of despair and doom has entered into TRAVIS' normally monotone narration voice: this will be the last entry in his diary.
TRAVIS (V.O.)
My whole life has pointed in one direction. I see that now. There never has been any choice for me.
CUT TO:
LENGTHY P.O.V. SHOT from TRAVIS' taxi: we see New York's nightlife as TRAVIS sees it. CAMERA TRACKS down midtown sidewalks in SLIGHTLY SLOW MOTION. There we see:
COUPLES, walking in SLOWING MOTION, young couples, middle-aged couples, old couples, hookers and johns, girlfriends, boyfriends, business friends -- the whole world matched up in pairs, and TRAVIS left wandering alone in the night.
Others would notice the breasts, the asses, the faces, but not TRAVIS: he notices the girl's hand that rubs the hair on her boyfriend's neck, the hand that hangs lightly on his shoulder, the nuzzling kiss in the ear.
TRAVIS (V.O.) (CONTD) Loneliness has followed me all my life. The life of loneliness pursues me wherever I go: in bars, cars, coffee shops, theaters, stores, sidewalks. There is no escape. I am God's lonely man.
MATCHCUT TO P.O.V.: another neighborhood, LATER IN THE NIGHT. Still in SLIGHTLY SLOW MOTION.
The CROWDS are more sparse here, the streets darker. A JUNKIE shudders in a doorway, a WINO pukes into a trash can, a STREET-WALKER meets a prospective CLIENT.
TRAVIS (V.O.) (CONTINUED) I am not a fool. I will no longer fool myself.
100.
I will no longer let myself fall apart, become a joke and object of ridicule. I know there is no longer any hope. I cannot continue this hollow, empty fight. I must sleep. What hope is there for me?
CUT TO:
INT. APARTMENT
TRAVIS, his shirt fastened, stands beside table.
C.U.: He lays a brief hand-written letter on the table. We read it.
Dear Iris, This money should be enough for your trip. By the time you read this I will be dead.
Travis
TRAVIS stacks five crisp hundred dollar bills beside the letter, folds them up with the letter, and puts them into an envelope.
TIMECUT: A SHORT WHILE LATER. TRAVIS has cleaned up his apartment. Everything is neat and orderly.
CAMERA PANS across room. The mattress is bare and flattened out, the floor is spotless, the cans and bottles of food and pills put out of sight. The wall is still covered with Palantine political paraphernalia, but when we reach the desk we see only four items there: an open diary and three loaded revolvers: .44, .38, .25.
TRAVIS, freshly shaved and neatly dressed, stands in the middle of his clean room. The empty holster hangs on his shoulder. Metal .25 gliders can be seen under the slit in his right sleeve. He turns toward table.
CUT TO:
TRAVIS, envelope in hand, closes the door behind him and walks down the corridor.
He passes a ajar door and we are suprised to see the room is empty--and trashed. Travis lives in a decaying, if not condemned building.
EXT.
TRAVIS places the envelope to IRIS in his mail box.
101.
BACK IN APARTMENT. CAMERA CLOSE ON revolvers lying on the table in neat array.
CUT TO:
FADE IN:
SOUND of a political rally: cheering, laughing, a band playing, talking.
AFTERNOON. A CROWD of about 500 PERSONS is assembled before a platform outside a Brooklyn union hall. A DIXIELAND BAND is playing on the platform.
C.U. CHARLES PALANTINE's feet climb out of a limousine.
There is a ROAR from the nearby CROWD.
PALANTINE, a bulky SECRET SERVICE MAN to the right and left of him, pushes his way through the CROWD toward the platform. Still cameras click, and TV cameras purr.
SLIGHT TIMECUT: PALANTINE is speaking on the platform.
CUT TO:
TRAVIS' empty taxi sits parked a few blocks away from rally. At this distance, the rally sounds are almost indistinguishable.
C.U. of TRAVIS' boots walking. They make their way past one person, then two, then a cluster of three or four. SOUNDS of rally increase.
We see a FULL FIGURE SHOT of TRAVIS: he is standing alone in an opening near the fringes of the CROWD.
TRAVIS looks like the most suspicious human being alive. His hair is cropped short, he wears mirror-reflecting glasses. His face is pallid and drained of color, his lips are pursed and drawn tight. He looks from side to side. One can now see the full effect of TRAVIS' lack of sleep and sufficient diet -- he looks sick and frail.
Even though it is a warm June day, TRAVIS is bundled up in a shirt, sweater and Army jacket buttoned from top to bottom. Under his jacket are several large lumps, causing his upper torso to look larger than it should. He is slightly hunched over and his hands shoved into his pockets.
Anyone scanning the crowd would immediately light upon TRAVIS and think, "There is an assassin."
102.
TRAVIS pulls the vial of red pills from his pocket and swallows a couple.
CUT TO:
SECRET SERVICE MAN standing beside the platform, scanning the CROWD. It is the same SECRET SERVICE MAN TRAVIS spoke to at the first rally. TOM, dressed in a conservative suit, stands beside him.
PALANTINE is wrapping up his short speech:
PALANTINE
...  and with your help we will go on to victry at the polls Tuesday.
(applause)
TRAVIS begins moving up into the
crowd.
PALANTINE (CONTD)
On to victory in Miami Beach next month
(building applause)
and on to victory next November!
PALANTINE steps back, smiling and receiving the applause. Then, nodding, at the SECRET SERVICE MAN he descends the stairs and prepares to work his way through the CROWD.
TRAVIS unbuttons the middle two buttons of his jacket, opening access to his holster. With the other hand he checks the .44 hooked behind his back.
PALANTINE smiles and shakes a few of the many hands outstretched toward him.
The SECRET SERVICE MAN, scanning the CROWD, spots something that interests him. He looks closely.
SECRET SERVICE MAN'S P.O.V.: TRAVIS, his face intense, pushes his way through the CROWD.
PALANTINE works his way through crowds and cameras.
SECRET SERVICE MAN motions to SECOND SECRET SERVICE MAN and points in TRAVIS' direction.
TRAVIS slips his hand into his jacket.
The SECOND SECRET SERVICE MAN converges on TRAVIS from the side.
TRAVIS and PALANTINE draw closer to each other.
103.
SECRET SERVICE MAN, walking just behind PALANTINE, grabs the candidate's hand and pulls him backward. PALANTINE looks sharply back at SECRET SERVICE MAN who motions for him to take a slightly altered route.
TRAVIS sees this: his eyes meet the SECRET SERVICE MAN's. He recognizes the situation. To his right he spots the
SECOND SECRET SERVICE MAN.
TRAVIS' eyes meet PALANTINE's: candidate and would-be assassin exchange quick glances.
TRAVIS hastily works his way back through the CROWD. He hears the SECRET SERVICE MAN's voice call out:
SECRET SERVICE MAN
Detain that man!
OVERHEAD SHOT reveals TRAVIS has the jump on his pursuers. He is breaking free of the CROWD while they are still mired in it.
TRAVIS, free of his pursuers, quickly makes his way down the sidewalks. The SECRET SERVICE MEN look futilely about.
TRAVIS jumps in his cab.	Sweat covers his face.
CUT TO:
The film is moving fast now; it pushes hard and straight toward its conclusion. We're moving toward the kill.
LATE AFTERNOON. TRAVIS' taxi skids around a corner and speeds into Manhattan.
TRAVIS checks his mail slot: the letter to IRIS has already been picked up by the MAILMAN.
TRAVIS, stripped to the waist, walks back and forth across his INT. APARTMENT, wiping his torso with a bath towel.
TRAVIS begins dressing:
--	He straps the Army combat knife to his calf.
--	He reflexes the metal gliders and the Colt .25 on his right forearm.
INTERCUT: SPORT stands in his doorway on the LOWER EAST SIDE shot with LONG DISTANCE LENS. It is EARLY EVENING.
INTERCUT: A pudgy middle-aged white PRIVATE COP walks up to SPORT.
104.
The two men laugh, slap each other on the back and exchange a soul shake. They discuss a little private business and the PRIVATE COP walks off in the direction of IRIS' apartment.
--	TRAVIS straps on holster and fits the .38 Special into
it.
INTERCUT: PRIVATE COP walks down block.
--	TRAVIS hooks the huge Magnum into the back of his belt. He puts on his Army jacket and walks out the door.
INTERCUT: PRIVATE COP turns up darkened stairway to IRIS' apartment.
NIGHT has fallen: TRAVIS' taxi careens down 10th Ave. He speeds, honks, accelerates quickly. The glare of speeding yellow and red lights flash through the night.
TRAVIS' P.O.V.: PEDESTRIAN attempts to flag down TRAVIS' taxi, but quickly steps back up on the curb when he sees TRAVIS has no intention of stopping for anything.
INTERCUT: SPORT maintains his post in the dark doorway. He waves to a GIRL who passes, and she waves back.
TRAVIS' taxi screeches to a stop and parks obliquely against the curb.
CUT TO:
TRAVIS walks down the block to the doorway where SPORT stands. CAMERA TRACKS with TRAVIS.
Without slowing, TRAVIS walks up to SPORT and puts his arm on his shoulder in a gesture of friendliness.
TRAVIS
Hey, Sport.	How are things?
SPORT
(shrugs)
O.K., cowboy.
TRAVIS
(needling him)
How are things in the pimp
business, hey Sport?
SPORT
What's going on?
105.
TRAVIS
I'm here to see Iris.
SPORT
Iris?
TRAVIS pushes SPORT back into the dark recesses of the corridor.
SPORT
Wha -- ?
TRAVIS
Yeah, Iris.	You know anybody by
that name?
SPORT
No.
(beat)
Hillbilly, you'd better get your
wise ass outa here and quick, or
you're gonna be in trouble.
TRAVIS is being propelled by an inner force, a force which takes him past the boundaries of reason and self-control.
TRAVIS
(restrained anger)
You carry a gun?
SPORT looks into TRAVIS' eyes, saying nothing: he realizes the seriousness of the situation.
TRAVIS pulls his .38 Special and holds it on SPORT, pushing him even further back against the wall.
TRAVIS
Get it.
SPORT
(submissive)
Hey, mister, I don't know what's going on here. This don't make any sense.
TRAVIS
(demanding)
Show it to me.
SPORT reluctantly pulls a .32 caliber pistol (a "purse gun") from his pocket and holds it limply.
106.
TRAVIS sticks his .38 into SPORT's gut and discharges it. There is a muffled blast, followed by a muted scream of pain.
TRAVIS
Now suck on that.
Agony and shock cross SPORT'S face as he slumps to the floor. TRAVIS turns and walks away before SPORT even hits.
As TRAVIS walks away, SPORT can be seen struggling in the b.g.
TRAVIS, he gun slipped into his jacket, walks quickly up the sidewalk.
AROUND THE CORNER, TRAVIS walks into the darkened stairway leading to IRIS' apartment.
As he walks up the stairs, TRAVIS pulls the .44 Magnum from behind his back and transfers the .38 Special to his left hand. He walks up the steps, a pistol dangling from each hand.
AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS, TRAVIS spots THE OLD MAN sitting at the far end of the dark corridor. THE OLD MAN starts to get up when TRAVIS discharges the mighty .44 at him. BLAAM! The hallway reverberates with shock waves and gun powder.
THE OLD MAN staggers at the end of the corridor: his right hand has been blown off at the forearm.
There is the sharp SOUND of a GUNSHOT behind TRAVIS: his face grimaces in pain. A bullet has ripped through the left side of his neck. Blood flows over his left shoulder.
TRAVIS' .44 flies into the air.
TRAVIS looks down the stairway: there SPORT lies choking in a puddle of his own blood. He has struggled long enough to fire one shot.
Falling, TRAVIS drills another .38 slug into SPORT's back but SPORT is already dead.
TRAVIS slumps to his knees. Down the corridor THE OLD MAN with a bloody stump is struggling toward him. TRAVIS turns his .38 toward THE OLD MAN.
The door to No. 2 opens: IRIS' scream is heard in the b.g. The bulky frame of the PRIVATE COP fills the doorway. His blue shirt is open, in his hand hangs a .38 service revolver.
107.
The PRIVATE COP raises his gun and shoots TRAVIS. TRAVIS, blood gushing from his right shoulder, sinks to the floor. His .38 clangs down the stairs.
THE OLD MAN grows closer. TRAVIS smashes his right arm against the wall, miraculously, the small Colt .25 glides down his forearm into his palm.
TRAVIS fills the PRIVATE COP's face full of bullet holes.
The PRIVATE COP, SCREAMING, crashes back into the room.
THE OLD MAN crashes atop TRAVIS. The .25 falls from TRAVIS' hand.
Both men are bleeding profusely as they thrash into IRIS' room. IRIS hides behind the old red velvet sofa, her face frozen in fright.
TRAVIS, trapped under the heavy OLD MAN, reaches down with his right hand and pulls the combat knife from his right calf.
Just as TRAVIS draws back the knife, THE OLD MAN brings his huge left palm crashing down on TRAVIS: THE OLD MAN's palm is impaled on the knife.
OLD MAN SCREAMS in pain.
Police SIRENS are heard in b.g.
With great effort, TRAVIS turns over, pinning THE OLD MAN to the floor. The bloody knife blade sticks through his upturned hand.
TRAVIS reaches over with his right hand and picks up the revolver of the new dead PRIVATE COP.
TRAVIS hoists himself up and sticks the revolver into the OLD MAN's mouth.
THE OLD MAN's voice is full of pain and ghastly fright:
OLD MAN
Don't kill me!	Don't kill me!
IRIS screams in b.g.	TRAVIS looks up:
IRIS
Don't kill him, Travis! Don't kill him!
TRAVIS fires the revolver, blowing the back of THE OLD MAN's head off the silencing his protests.
108.
The police SIRENS screech to a halt. SOUND of police officers running up the stairs.
TRAVIS struggles up and collapses on the red velvet sofa, his blood-soaked body blending with the velvet.
IRIS retreats in fright against the far wall.
First uniformed POLICE OFFICER rushes in room, drawn gun in hand. Other POLICEMEN can be heard running up the stairs.
TRAVIS looks helplessly up at the OFFICER. He forms his bloody hand into a pistol, raises it to his forehead and, his voice croaking in pain, makes the sound of a pistol discharging.
TRAVIS
Pgghew!	Pgghew!
Out of breath fellow OFFICERS join the first POLICEMAN. They survey the room.
TRAVIS' head slumps against the sofa.
IRIS is huddled in the corner, shaking.
LIVE SOUND CEASES.
OVERHEAD SLOW MOTION TRACKING SHOT surveys the damage:
--	from IRIS shaking against the blood-spattered wall
--	to TRAVIS blood-soaked body lying on the sofa
--	to THE OLD MAN with half a head, a bloody stump for one hand and a knife sticking out the other
--	to POLICE OFFICERS staring in amazement
--	to the PRIVATE COP's bullet-ridden face trapped near the doorway
--	to puddles of blood and a lonely .44 Magnum lying on the hallway carpet.
--	down the blood-specked stairs on which lies a nickle-plated .38 Smith and Wesson Special
--	to the foot of the stairs where SPORT's body is hunched over a pool of blood and a small .32 lies near his hand
--	to CROWDS huddled around the doorway, held back by POLICE OFFICERS
109.
--	past red flashing lights, running POLICEMEN and parked police cars
--	to the ongoing nightlife of the Lower East Side, curious but basically unconcerned, looking then heading its own way.

FADE IN:
EXT. TRAVIS' APARTMENT - DAY
It is EARLY FALL.	The trees are losing their leaves.
CUT TO:
SLOW TRACKING SHOT across INT. APARTMENT. Room appears pretty much the same, although there is a new portable TV and an inexpensive easy chair.
VISUAL: TRACK begins at table and works across the room to the mattress.
We see these items:
--	On the table rests the diary, closed. A desk calendar stands on the table: it is October.
--	Across the wall where the Palantine clippings once hung there are now a series of new newspaper clippings. Right to left, they read:
The first is a full back page from the N.Y. Daily News. Headline reads: "CABBIE BATTLES GANGSTERS." There are large photos of police standing in IRIS' room after the slaughter, and a picture of TRAVIS' cabbie mug shot.
Underneath there is a more discreet clipping without photo from the N.Y. Times. Two-column headline reads: "Cabbie Shootout, Three Dead."
A follow-up story from the News. Two-column photo shows plain middle-aged couple sitting in middle-class living room. Two-column headline reads: "Parents Express Shock, Gratitude."
A two-column Daily News story without photo. Headline reads: "Taxi-Driver Hero to Recover."
A one-column two-paragraph News story stuck on an obscure page. Headline reads: "Cabbie Returns to Job."
--	At the end of the clippings, a letter is tacked to the wall.
110.
It is a simple letter hand-written on plain white paper. The handwriting makes a conscious effort to appear neat and orderly. We recognize that it is the same letter that is being read in voice over.
--	When we finally arrive at the mattress, we find it is
barren. A pillow and blanket (new purchases) are folded at the head of the mattress.
AUDIO: THROUGHOUT THE TRACK, we hear the voice of a middle-aged uneducated man reading in voice over.
It is the voice of IRIS' FATHER and he is reading a letter he sent to TRAVIS, and which TRAVIS has tacked to his wall.
IRIS' FATHER (V.O.)
Dear Mr. Bickle,
I can't say how happy Mrs. Steensma and I were to hear that you are well and recuperating. We tried to visit you at the hospital when we were in New York to pick up Iris, but you were still in a coma.
There is no way we can repay you for returning our Iris to us. We thought we had lost her, but now our lives are full again. Needless to say, you are something of a hero around this household.
I'm sure you want to know about Iris. She is back in school and working hard. The transition has been very hard for her, as you can well imagine, but we have taken steps to see she never has cause to run away again.
In conclusion, Mrs. Steensma and I would like to again thank you from the bottom of our hearts. Unfortunately, we cannot afford to come to New York again to thank you in person, or we surely would. But if you should ever come to Pittsburgh, you would find yourself a most welcome guest in our home.
Our deepest thanks,
Burt and Ivy Steensma
CUT TO:
EXT. PLAZA HOTEL - NIGHT
Four cabs stand in the waiting line in front of the hotel.
Near the entrance, TRAVIS and WIZARD stand in the light talking.
TRAVIS' hair is almost fully grown back to its normal length.
111.
TRAVIS wears the same clothes -- cowboy boots, jeans, western shirt, Army jacket -- but he isn't wearing a gun. There is a thick scar on the left side of his neck.
Wizard is speaking.
WIZARD
A private-owner wanted to swap
wheels.	Now my tires were brand
new. "Give me a couple days," I
says.
CHARLIE T. parks his cab in line and walks toward TRAVIS and
WIZARD.
CHARLIE T
Howdy Wizard, Killer.
CHARLIE T. points his pistol/finger at TRAVIS, fires, says "Pow" and laughs.
CHARLIE T (CONTD)
(casual joking)
Don't mess with the Killer.
TRAVIS
(smiles)
Hey Charlie T.
WIZARD
Howsit, Charlie?
(pause)
Hey Travis, I think you gota fare.
They all turn. P.O.V. of DOORMAN closing rear door of TRAVIS' taxi.
TRAVIS
Shit.
(runs off)
CHARLIE T
Take it slow, Killer.
TRAVIS waves back to CHARLIE T. and WIZARD as he runs around cab and jumps in the driver's seat.
TRAVIS' taxi pulls away.
C.U. TRAVIS at the wheel.	A FEMALE VOICE says:
FEMALE VOICE
East 56th Street.
112.
TRAVIS recognizes the voice. He looks in the rear-view mirror: It is BETSY.
TRAVIS says nothing: he heads toward 56th Street.
After a silence, BETSY speaks:
BETSY
Hello, Travis.
TRAVIS
Hello, Betsy.
There is an uneasy pause.
TRAVIS
I see where Palantine got the
nomination.
BETSY
Yes.	It won't be long now.
Seventeen days.
TRAVIS
Well, I hope he wins.
There is another pause.
BETSY
(concerned)
How are you, Travis? I read about you in the papers.
TRAVIS
Oh, I got over that. It was nothing, really. The papers always blow these things up.
(a beat)
A little stiffness.	That'll go
away.	I just sleep more, that's
all.
EXT.
TRAVIS' taxi pulls up to 34 East 56th Street.
TRAVIS
Here we are.
BETSY digs in her purse.
113.
TRAVIS
(protesting)
No, no, please.	This fare's on me.
Please.
BETSY
Thank you, Travis.
BETSY gets out of the cab and stands by the right front window, which is open.
TRAVIS prepares to drive away.
BETSY
Travis?
TRAVIS
Yeah.
BETSY
Maybe I'll see you again sometime, huh?
TRAVIS
(thin smile)
Sure.
BETSY steps away from the curb and TRAVIS drives off. She watches his taxi.
CAMERA FOLLOWS TRAVIS' taxi as it slowly disappears down
Street.
