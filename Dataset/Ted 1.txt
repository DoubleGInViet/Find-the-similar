EXT. SPACE - X

As the Universal logo completes itself, we begin to slowly push in on the East Coast of the United States. The camera glides down through the atmosphere, through the clouds, closer and closer, until we begin to see large patches of snow covering the upper coastline. It’s winter. We continue to push in, until we arrive at one small suburban neighborhood. Over the push-in, we hear the following narration, delivered by Patrick Stewart.

NARRATOR (V.O.)

It has been said that magic vanished from our world a long time ago. And that humanity can no longer fulfill its desires through the power of wishes.

To those who have lost the wondrous vision of childhood eyes, submitted here is the story of a little boy, and a magical Christmas wish that changed his life forever.


EXT./ESTAB. A SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - MORNING

NARRATOR (V.O.)
It began in 1985, in a town just outside
Boston.

We see a GROUP OF KIDS laughing and tossing snowballs at each other in the street.

NARRATOR (V.O.)

It was Christmas Eve, and all the children were in high spirits. That special time of year when Boston children gather together and beat up the Jewish kids.

Another little kid walks out of his house with a sled, and starts walking up the street. One of the snowball-throwing kids points at the sled kid.

KID #1

Hey, Greenbaum!

GREENBAUM

Uh oh.

KID #1

It’s Jesus’ birthday tomorrow! You know what I’m gonna get him?

GREENBAUM

W...what?


 
2

CONTINUED:

KID #1

My fist in your fuckin’ face!

GREENBAUM

Why would Jesus want that?

KID #2

Get him!

The kids all chase Greenbaum up the street, and tackle him. Another boy, JOHN BENNETT (about 8 years old, shy and innocent-looking) approaches the melee.

NARRATOR (V.O.)

But there was one child who wasn’t in such good spirits. Little John Bennett. That one boy in every neighborhood who just has a tough time making friends.

JOHN

Hey guys, can I play?

The kids all look at him.

KID #1/#2/#3
Get outta here! / Get outta here,
Bennett! / Get lost, Bennett!

The Jewish kid, his face bloodied, looks angrily at John.

GREENBAUM

Yeah, Bennett, get outta here!

The kids go back to beating up Greenbaum, as John sadly walks back toward his house.


INT. JOHN’S BEDROOM - SHORTLY AFTER

NARRATOR (V.O.)

John longed with all his heart for that one true friend that he could call his own. And he knew that if he ever found that friend, he would never let him go.

John sadly sits by his window with his chin in his hands, looking outside. John’S POV - We see the other kids all playing in the snow: building snowmen, throwing snowballs, etc. At one point, a BLACK KID IN A WHEELCHAIR wheels up. The other kids welcome him with open arms, and he immediately joins in the fun.

NARRATOR (V.O.)

Well, as it does every year, Christmas morning finally came.
(MORE)

CONTINUED:
NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT'D) All the children were opening their gifts with holiday glee.


INT. A SUBURBAN HOUSE - MORNING

A LITTLE GIRL opens a present as her parents look on, smiling. Inside is a My Little Pony. She smiles with delight.


INT. ANOTHER SUBURBAN HOUSE - MORNING

A LITTLE BOY opens a present as HIS PARENTS look on, smiling. Inside is a G.I. Joe Hovercraft. The boy is overjoyed.


INT. A THIRD SUBURBAN HOUSE - MORNING

ANOTHER LITTLE BOY opens a present as his parents look on, smiling. Inside is a “Darth Vader head” action figure case. The boy opens it up, revealing that it’s full of “Star Wars” action figures. The boy jumps around ecstatically.


EXT./ESTAB. A FOURTH SUBURBAN HOUSE - MORNING


INT. A FOURTH SUBURBAN HOUSE - SAME

NARRATOR (V.O.)
And for little John Bennett, Christmas
Day brought a very special new arrival.

John sits amidst unwrapped gifts. We see him opening a present. Inside is a plush, adorable-looking teddy bear. The boy holds it with delight.

JOHN

Wow!

HIS MOM AND DAD hug him.

JOHN’S DAD

I guess Santa paid attention to how good you were this year, huh?

JOHN’S MOM
(kissing him)
Merry Christmas, John.

John hugs the teddy bear. It makes a cutesy, high-pitched “I wuv you” sound. John gasps with delight.

CONTINUED:

JOHN

He talks!

John giggles happily, squeezing the bear to make it talk, as his mom and dad exchange a smile.

JOHN (CONT’D)

I’m gonna name you Teddy.


INT. JOHN’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

John sits on the floor watching the 1980 film “Flash Gordon” on TV. He eats Twizzlers with Ted sitting next to him. Occasionally he gives Ted a “bite.”

NARRATOR (V.O.)

John became instantly attached to Teddy. There was something about that bear that made him feel as if he finally had a friend with whom he could share his deepest secrets.


INT. JOHN’S ROOM - NIGHT

JOHN

Hey Teddy... can I tell you something nobody knows?

Teddy looks back at him, expressionless.

JOHN (CONT’D)

Last week, my mom and dad took me to the park for a picnic. And they have this duck pond there, and... when nobody was looking, I pooped in my hand and threw it at a duck. Was that mean?

He squeezes Ted, who once again makes the “I wuv you” sound.

JOHN (CONT’D)
(hugging him)
I love you too, Teddy!

John gets into bed with the teddy bear, and snuggles with it.

JOHN (CONT’D)

You know... I wish you could really talk to me. Because then we could be best friends forever and ever.
 



 
5

CONTINUED:

John drifts off to sleep. The camera moves toward the window, and drifts outside. It pulls back from the house slowly.

NARRATOR (V.O.)

Now, if there’s one thing you can be sure of... it’s that nothing is more powerful than a young boy’s wish.
(beat)

Except an Apache helicopter. An Apache helicopter has machine guns and missiles. It is an unbelievably impressive complement of weaponry. An absolute death machine. Well, as it turned out, John picked the perfect night to make a wish.


EXT. JOHN’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

The camera pivots around to face the sky. We see the snow falling from moonlit clouds. At the center of the clouds, there is a small patch of open air through which we can see stars. Suddenly, a shooting star whizzes by through the opening.


INT. JOHN’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

SLOWLY PUSH IN on the teddy bear’s face as John lies sleeping next to it.

DISSOLVE TO:


EXT.	NEIGHBORHOOD - NEXT MORNING

The house and yard are covered with snow.


INT. JOHN’S BEDROOM - SAME

John slowly opens his eyes. He turns over to face Teddy, but we see that Teddy is no longer next to him. John bolts upright and looks around, frantically.

JOHN
Teddy?
(beat, a bit more concerned)
Teddy?!
 







 
6

CONTINUED:

John looks under the covers, but the bear is not there. He jumps out of bed and looks around the bed’s perimeter, assuming that Teddy must have fallen off during the night. Finally, he checks underneath the bed. ANGLE FROM UNDERNEATH THE BED we see John looking around.

JOHN (CONT’D)

Teddy?

John sits up again and freezes, looking right into the
camera, wide eyed.	ANGLE ON JOHN’S P.O.V.: We see the
face of Teddy staring right at him.	Teddy blinks once.

TEDDY

Hug me.

John yelps and stumbles back, falling over. He stares at Teddy, breathing heavily.

JOHN

Did you... did you just talk?

TEDDY

You’re my best friend, John.

JOHN
(beat)
You’re alive?!

TEDDY

Uh-huh.

JOHN

Whoa...

TEDDY

Don’t look so surprised. You’re the one who wished for it, aren’t you?

JOHN

Yeah, I... I did wish for it.

TEDDY

Well, here I am.

JOHN
You mean... we get to be best friends...
for real?

TEDDY

For real.

JOHN

Forever and ever?
 


 
7

CONTINUED:

TEDDY

Sounds good to me.

A huge grin spreads across John’s face. He gets up, runs to Teddy and hugs him.

NARRATOR (V.O.)

John was just about the happiest boy in the world. And he couldn’t wait to tell everyone the good news.


INT. KITCHEN - SHORTLY AFTER

John’s Dad sits at the breakfast table, reading the paper as John’s Mom prepares eggs and bacon, putting it on their plates.

JOHN’S MOM
Well, I think we had a wonderful
Christmas this year.

JOHN’S DAD
One of the best.
(slyly)
And I particularly enjoyed the gift you gave me last night.

John runs into the kitchen.

JOHN

Mom! Dad! Guess what?! My teddy bear’s alive!

John’s Mom and Dad look at each other and smile.

JOHN’S MOM
(playing along)
Really, sweetie?	Well, that’s exciting.

JOHN

No mom, he’s alive!	For real!	Look!

Teddy walks in and stands next to John.

TEDDY

Merry Christmas, everybody!

John’s Dad scrambles to his feet, knocking plates off the table. John’s mom screams.

JOHN’S DAD

Jesus H. Fuck!
 



 
8

CONTINUED:

TEDDY

Let’s all be best friends!

JOHN’S MOM

Oh my god...

JOHN’S DAD

John, get away from that thing! Come over here, right now!

JOHN

But Dad--

JOHN’S DAD

GET OVER HERE!

John reluctantly walks over to his dad, who grabs him and protectively pulls him aside.

JOHN’S DAD (CONT’D)

Helen, get my gun.

JOHN

Dad, no!

TEDDY

Is it a hugging gun?

JOHN’S DAD

Helen, get my gun, and call the police!

TEDDY

I’m sorry, Mr. Bennett. I didn’t mean to scare anybody. I just wanted John and I to be friends.

JOHN
Yeah, Dad!	I made a wish last night that
Teddy was alive, and my wish came true!

JOHN’S MOM
(astonished whisper)
My god, Steve... it’s a miracle. A Christmas miracle.

They stare at Teddy for a beat.

NARRATOR (V.O.)

Well, it wasn’t long before the story of John’s little miracle was sweeping the nation.

INT. NEWSROOM - DAY (ON TV)

We see an 80’s NEWSCASTER behind the news desk. A graphic of the bear is over his left shoulder.

The male newscaster turns sharply to her.

MALE NEWSCASTER

INT. TONIGHT SHOW - DAY (ON TV)

NARRATOR (V.O.)

Before long, Teddy had become a huge celebrity in his own right.

We see REAL FOOTAGE of “The Tonight Show” from the ‘80’s, with Johnny Carson talking to Teddy, who is sitting in the guest chair (If appropriate footage is accessible, will include Teddy walking out on stage, shaking hands with Johnny and sitting down.)

REST OF CARSON SCENE TBD BASED ON ARCHIVE FOOTAGE


INT. A SHITTY APARTMENT - NIGHT


INT. JOHN’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

John and Teddy are in bed, under the covers with a flashlight.

NARRATOR (V.O.)

But through all the fame, Teddy never forgot his very best friend, John.

JOHN (O.S., UNDER COVERS)

The thunder can’t get us, right?

TEDDY (O.S., UNDER COVERS) Nope. We’re thunder buddies. And the thunder knows it. We’re totally safe.

ANGLE UNDER THE COVERS - we now see them.

JOHN

Teddy?

TEDDY

Yeah, John?

JOHN

Do you promise we’ll always be together?

TEDDY

I	promise. Another thunder clap.

TEDDY (CONT’D)

Thunder buddies for life.

JOHN

Thunder buddies for life.


 
11

CONTINUED:

They hug as we PULL BACK SLOWLY, dissolving through the covers.

NARRATOR (V.O.)

And that was a promise that neither one of them ever forgot.

Over the following, we continue to pull back from the room to the outside of the moonlit house...

NARRATOR (V.O.)

So where are John and Teddy today? Well, let me put it this way: no matter how big a splash you make in this world, whether you’re Corey Feldman, Frankie Muniz, Justin Bieber, or a talking teddy bear, eventually nobody gives a shit.

SMASH CUT TO:

INT. JOHN AND LORI’S APARTMENT - DAY

John and Lori paint the apartment walls. Lori sneaks up behind John, and paints his back. John turns around and grabs her. They scuffle playfully, and then kiss. We ANGLE ON Ted, who stands on a little stepladder hammering a “Home Sweet Home” picture into the wall. He steps back, but realizes he has nailed his hand to the wall. He tugs, slips, and the ladder falls. Ted hangs there like an idiot.


INT. JOHN AND LORI’S APARTMENT - NIGHT (PHOTO)

EXT./ ESTAB. JOHN AND LORI’S APARTMENT - MORNING


INT. JOHN AND LORI’S APARTMENT - SAME

CLOSE ON a bong. PULL OUT TO REVEAL Ted, who inhales, his snout inside the tube. Ted sits on the sofa, and for the first time, we see Ted in his present day form: he is ratty, patched-up, and worn-looking. He has a couple stains, some small spots of exposed stuffing, and there’s evidence of some half-assed sewing. It’s obvious he’s been around for three decades. He and John, who sits next to him, are both clearly stoned as we join them. John, for his part, looks far too comfortable in the too-worn Red Sox T-shirt he wears. He eats directly from a box of Fruity Pebbles. Reaching in for a last handful, he finds the box almost empty. He raises it to empty the remainder into his mouth, and accidentally pours Fruity Pebbles all over his face. It doesn’t faze him much, though, as he brushes them off. It’s quite obvious that this is a guy who has never really given up his childhood... and has never given up his teddy bear. Ted passes the bong to John.

TED

All I’m sayin’ is Boston women are are, on the whole, a paler, uglier sort than women from the elsewheres of life.

JOHN

That’s bullshit, what about Lori? She’s hot.

TED

Lori’s from Pennsylvania, not a Boston girl.


 
16

CONTINUED:

JOHN

They’re not that bad.

John takes a hit from the bong over Ted’s next line.

TED

The fact that you have to say they’re not that bad means that they are that bad. They turn into drunk, half-white, half-pink monsters after 2 hours at any beach.

Ted takes a hit from the bong.

TED (CONT’D)
(coughs)
Jesus, this is weak. It’s not even gettin’ me high. I gotta have a talk with my weed guy.

JOHN

I-- It’s workin’ for me.

TED

I think it sucks, I’m gonna have a talk with him.

JOHN

Yeah, I don’t know that you wanna go to a drug dealer with complaints.

TED

No, I know this guy a long time. I’ve known him since 9/11. Remember, I was like, “Aw, shit. 9/11. I gotta get high.”

JOHN
(looks at his watch)
Oh fuck, is it nine-thirty? Shit, I gotta get to work.

John gets up, and hurries into the other room to get dressed.

TED

Hey, you mind pickin’ up a bird feeder on the way home? I wanna start enjoying the beauty of birds.

JOHN (O.S.)

Jesus, I don’t know if I can drive.

TED

I’ll drive you, I feel fine.
 
17


EXT. BOSTON STREETS - CONTINUOUS

We see two shots of John’s car driving through the city: We see John in the passenger’s seat putting Visine into his eyes, with only Ted’s ears and eyes showing as he drives (his paws grip the wheel). We then cut to an overhead pull-back shot as we move away from the car to reveal it crossing Boston’s huge suspension bridge.


EXT. LIBERTY RENT-A-CAR - MORNING

John’s car pulls up the street and into the parking lot, scraping its side against the corner headlight of one of the rental cars.

JOHN/TED

Aw, Jesus. / Fuck.

ANGLE ON Ted’s feet. There are wooden blocks attached to the pedals so that his feet can reach them. He slams on the brakes. ANGLE OUTSIDE THE CAR. John gets out, and looks at the damage.

JOHN

Aw, man.

TED

Is it bad?

JOHN

It’s not good.

ANGLE ON THE RENT-A-CAR OFFICE - THOMAS, the branch manager, an intense, middle-aged man, is standing in the doorway.

THOMAS

John!	May I speak with you, please?

JOHN

Shit.

TED
It’s okay, go, go, I’ll pull outta here.
(waving)
Hi, Thomas!	How are ya?

Thomas dryly waves back. Ted pulls forward, scraping the car again. He abruptly pulls out into traffic, and another car swerves a bit to get around him, honking.

OTHER DRIVER

Asshole!
 


 
18

CONTINUED:

TED
(overlapping)
Easy, Jersey license!

Ted drives away.


INT. THOMAS’ OFFICE - SHORTLY AFTER

Thomas sits at his desk facing John.

THOMAS

John, it’s almost ten o’clock.

JOHN

I know, I’m sorry, it wasn’t my fault.

THOMAS

What do you mean?

JOHN
(beat)
I guess I... wasn’t really prepared for a follow-up question.

THOMAS

John, all you have to do is not fuck up, and you get my job when I go to corporate next month. You will be the new branch manager. All you have to do is not fuck up, and all you’re doing is fucking up. Not that I don’t think you’re too fucked up to handle not fucking up my job, but you happen to be the least fucked-up person in the whole office. The next least fucked-up is Alix, and you’ve been here three fucking years longer than him. But I’m telling you, I will promote the fuck out of him if you fuck up one more time. That is all. Fuck.

JOHN

Sir, I promise, you’re not gonna regret promoting the fuck out of me.

THOMAS

Good. I like hearing that. Because in a month my life now could be your life: a cushy $38,000-a-year branch manager who’s personal friends with Tom Skerritt. It’s not a bad life, is it?

JOHN

N--no.
 


 
19

CONTINUED:

THOMAS
Did you know I’m friends with Tom
Skerritt?

JOHN

No.

THOMAS

I’ll show you something I don’t show too many people, because I don’t want anyone treating me differently.

Thomas takes out a framed picture of himself with Tom Skerritt.

THOMAS (CONT’D)

That’s me and Tom Skerritt.

JOHN
(slightly overdone)
Wowwww.

THOMAS

Goddamn right, wow. Now get outta here. I’m gonna dock you for being late, and for the scratch on that car. Try and be a little more responsible tomorrow.

JOHN

I will, sir. Thank you. I won’t let you down, Goose.

THOMAS

What?

JOHN

Top Gun.

THOMAS

So?

JOHN

Tom Skerritt.

THOMAS

Oh.

John exits.


INT. LIBERTY RENT-A-CAR FRONT OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

John emerges from Thomas’ office, and walks out into the front desk area.

CONTINUED:

We see his coworker, Guy (a burly Patrick-Warburton type), handing a car key and a rental envelope to a pleasant-looking couple. He looks tired, disheveled, and a little bruised.

GUY

There you go, here’s your key and rental agreement, and a complimentary map of Boston. Thanks for choosing Liberty, drive safely.

HUSBAND/WIFE

Thank you./Thanks so much.

The couple exits.	Guy turns to face John.

GUY

Hey, heard you got busted.

JOHN

Jesus, Guy, you look like shit, what happened?

GUY

I don’t know, man. I got fuckin’ wasted last night, and my phone says I texted somebody at 3:15 asking them to beat me up. And then at 4:30 I texted the same person saying thanks.

JOHN

And you don’t remember it?

GUY

No.	Same as last time.

JOHN

It... it just seems gay, doesn’t it?

GUY

I don’t know.	Maybe, yeah.

JOHN

Do you think you’re part of some, like, gay beat-up underworld? Like one of those gay beat-up clubs?

GUY

I don’t know. I dig chicks. I don’t remember any of it, I was so fucked up. I might be gay, I don’t know. You mind covering for me for a bit? I’m gonna go lay down in the john.
 



 
21

CONTINUED:

Guy starts to leave, when ALIX, a foreign guy with a vague European accent, long dark hair, and a great tan walks up.

ALIX

Hey you buddies.	Where’s it hanging?

GUY/JOHN

Hey Alix. / Hey, how was the club last night?

ALIX

Ah, I didn’t get in because the bouncer was doucheface, but I made friends in the line.

GUY

Oh, well, that’s good I guess.

We see TANYA, an unbelievably gorgeous salesgirl, enter from the back with a set of keys.

TANYA

Hi you guys.

Over the following, Tanya puts the keys away, walks over to her station and sits.

ALIX

You look so pretty today.

TANYA

Aw, thanks Alix, I worked out this morning.

ALIX

I can tell, you are less fat than you have been.

JOHN

Hey guys, does anybody know a nice restaurant? Like something where the napkins are cloth?

GUY

For what?

JOHN

Lori and I have been dating four years tomorrow, and I wanted to take her someplace nice.

TANYA

Oh wow, congratulations, John.
 


 
22

CONTINUED:

GUY

You guys‘ve been goin’ out for four years?

JOHN

Yeah.

GUY
That’s in--
(high-pitched)
--saaaane, my longest relationship was like six months, and then she farted in her sleep. I’m like, I am outta here, man. Was gone before she woke up.

JOHN

Wow, you’re... not very tolerant, huh.

GUY

Lori ever fart in front of you?

JOHN

Yes.

GUY

Really.

JOHN

Yes.	Many times.

GUY

You Italian?

JOHN

No.

GUY

Oh.

JOHN

Why?

GUY

I dunno, just seems like-- never mind, take her to Benihana.

TANYA

Don’t you think after four years, maybe she’s probably hoping for something more than dinner?

JOHN

Like what?
 



 
23

CONTINUED:

TANYA

Well, if I were her, I’d be expecting a proposal.

JOHN

Oh come on, nobody’s expecting anybody to propose. Marriage isn’t... I mean, isn’t love enough? I submit that love is enough.

GUY

You could put the ring in her ass and let her fart it out.


EXT./ ESTAB. JOHN AND LORI’S APARTMENT - LATE AFTERNOON


INT. JOHN AND LORI’S APARTMENT - SAME

John and Ted sit on the couch, in the same exact spots we saw them earlier, bookending the day. John drinks a beer as they watch TV. Ted lights up a bong and inhales. The TV blares the opening titles of the 1980 film “Flash Gordon.” As “Flash’s Theme” plays:

JOHN

So bad, but so good.

TED

Yes, a study in contrasts.

JOHN
Oh, I love this part.
(singing along)
HE’S FOR EVERY ONE OF US!

TED
(singing along)
STAND FOR EVERY ONE OF US!

JOHN
(singing along)
HE’LL SAVE WITH A MIGHTY HAND/EVERY MAN EVERY WOMAN EVERY CHILD WITH A MIGHTY FLASH!

TED

Fuck yeah, Flash! (then) Hey, before I forget, let’s nail down a plan for the Bruins game tomorrow night.

JOHN

I can’t, I’m taking Lori to dinner.

TED

For what?

JOHN

Well, we’ve been dating four years tomorrow.

TED

Oh, fuck me.	Nice.

JOHN

Lemme ask you something... you don’t think she’s gonna be expecting something... big, do you?

TED
(beat)
What, like anal?

JOHN

No, like... a circular gold thing on the finger.

TED
Oh, fuck that!	It’s four years!	You and
I have been together 27 years!

Ted jumps on John, and starts playfully punching him in the face.

TED (CONT’D)

Where’s my ring, Johnny? Where’s my ring, asshole?

JOHN

Stop it!	Jesus Christ, knock it off!

He throws Ted off of him.

JOHN (CONT’D)

I mean, do you think she might be expecting me to make that kinda move?

TED
No, John.	It’s a bad idea.	And it’s the
wrong time.	What with the economy and...
the credit bubble... the Supreme Court...
I mean, look at Haiti.

JOHN

I guess I didn’t think about that.

ANGLE ON TV - We see Flash Gordon facing Ming the Merciless.

KLYTUS (ON TV)

Who are you?

FLASH (ON TV)
Flash Gordon.	Quarterback.	New York
Jets.

JOHN

This is the American fantasy, right here. A professional NFL player is called upon to save the world.

TED

Tom Brady could do that.

JOHN

Tom Brady could do that.

The front door opens and LORI, an attractive girl in her mid to late 20’s, enters holding several grocery bags.

LORI

Hi guys.

JOHN

Hey, sweetie.

TED

Hey, Lori.

John gets up and gives Lori a kiss.

LORI

Ooh.	I think you just got me stoned.

JOHN
(re: groceries)
What do we got there?

LORI

Turkey burgers.

TED

Oh. Okay. Are we having homos over for dinner or something?

LORI
(wiseass)
No, just you homos.

TED/JOHN

Whoa!!!

CONTINUED:

TED

She’s funny, John. You got yourself a regular Toni Collette.

LORI

Wait, who’s that?	Is that good?

JOHN

She’s a comedienne.

LORI

Oh nice.	Is she pretty?

JOHN

She’s as pretty as she is funny. How was work?

LORI

Good.

JOHN

How’s your dickhead boss?

LORI

Rex is fine. He only hit on me once today, so that’s good.

JOHN

I’m not saying this to be mean, but I really hope that fucker gets leukemia.

LORI

He’s harmless, I can handle it.

TED

Hey Johnny, while you’re up, grab me a beer, huh?

JOHN
(crossing to fridge)
Oh yeah, a coupla’ Charles Brew-Kowskis?

TED

Yes, a Brew-stoy-ovski would be nice right about now.

We see Lori roll her eyes.	She’s heard this before.

LORI

Jesus.

JOHN

Maybe a Mike Brew-ga-slow-ski?
 



 
27

CONTINUED:

TED

Perhaps a Ted Kazyn-brewski?

LORI
Y’know, I think I might also have a
Martina Navra-ti-brewski.

JOHN/TED

Ohhhh, that doesn’t work!/Come on, don’t ruin it, yeah, that doesn’t work.

LORI

Bullshit, what do you mean?

JOHN

It doesn’t work, the name has to have a “ski” at the end of it. You just put “brewski” on the end of Martina Navratolova.

LORI

I thought we were just doing funny names.

TED

No, it’s gotta have a “ski” at the end. Otherwise where’s the challenge? If there’s no “ski” at the end of the root word, then we would just be idiots saying nonsense.


EXT./ ESTAB. JOHN AND LORI’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

It’s raining, with an occasional roll of thunder.


INT. JOHN AND LORI’S	APARTMENT - SAME

Lori lies in bed holding an iPad, reading a gossip news site, with the TV on. John comes out of the bathroom, and cozies up next to her.

LORI
(off iPad)
Oh, look, they found those missing hikers.

JOHN

They did?	What happened?

LORI

It says they got separated and one of them had his foot trapped under a rock for five days.
 


 
28

CONTINUED:

JOHN

You know, if your leg got trapped under a rock, I’d chew it off to get you free.

LORI
(sweetly)
You would?

JOHN
I sure would.
(beat)
Is that cannibalism?

LORI

No, I think it’s only cannibalism if you swallow.

JOHN

Oh yeah, no, I don’t swallow.

She laughs.

LORI

Really? That’s not what I heard about you.

JOHN

It’s not true, I’m a fuckin’ classy broad.

LORI
(laughs again)
I can see that.
(then)
Y’know, speaking of classy, Ciao Bella’s a really expensive restaurant. If you want, we can go somewhere else tomorrow night. I don’t care, as long as we’re together.

JOHN

You kiddin’ me? Four years we been going out, I’m takin’ you to the best place in town. I been crappin’ out room for it for two days, I know exactly what I’m gonna order.

LORI
(leaning in to kiss him)
You’re disgusting.

JOHN

And you get to pick any bottle of wine.
 



 
29

CONTINUED:

LORI

Ooh.

JOHN

Any bottle of 2012 wine.

LORI

Oh, are the new wines in?

JOHN

They are in and they. Are. Fresh.


She leans over and kisses him again.	He kisses her back.

JOHN (CONT’D)

I love you.

LORI

I love you, too.

They continue to kiss, becoming more and more intimate. She starts to pull his T-shirt off, when there is a thunder clap from outside.

JOHN

Ah, come on!

LORI
(shaking her head)
I don’t understand it, 35 years old, and you’re still scared of a little thunder.

JOHN

I am not.

We hear another thunderclap. Ted runs into the room with no warning and leaps into bed, right between Lori and John.

TED
Thunder buddies for life, right Johnny?
C’mon, let’s sing the thunder song!

JOHN/TED
(singing)
WHEN YOU HEAR THE SOUND OF THUNDER, DON’T YOU GET TOO SCARED / JUST GRAB YOUR THUNDER BUDDY AND SAY THESE MAGIC WORDS: FUCK YOU THUNDER, YOU CAN EAT MY ASS / YOU CAN’T GET ME THUNDER, ‘CAUSE YOU’RE JUST GOD’S FARTS.

TED

Boomp.

CONTINUED:

Lori rolls over and goes to sleep with a groan.


EXT./ ESTAB. BOSTON HIGH RISE - DAY

Lori enters the building.


INT. OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

Lori gets off the elevator, where we see several signs that read “PLYMOUTH PUBLIC RELATIONS.” Lori goes to her desk, looking exhausted. Lori’s office friends, GINA, MICHELLE, and TRACY approach.

GINA

Wow...Baby, I’m not saying this to be nasty, but you look really tired.

LORI

Oh, I’m okay... except I didn’t have time for breakfast, the garage was full, I spilled coffee on my leg, and I have a boyfriend who can’t sleep through a storm without his teddy bear.

GINA

I don’t understand why you keep putting up with him.

TRACY

Yeah, I mean, the guy’s thirty-five years old and he’s working for a rental car service.

LORI

No, it’s not that, I don’t care about that. I’d love him even if he was a janitor. I mean, he’s got a huge heart, we laugh together all the time, and it’s just a bonus that he’s like the hottest guy in Boston.

GINA

Yeah but the hottest guy in Boston is like being the classiest Kardashian.

LORI

I just wish he could get his life together, you know? Our life. And he can’t, and I swear to god, it’s all because of that bear.
 





 
31

CONTINUED:

MICHELLE

You should give him an ultimatum: it’s you or the bear.

LORI
I can’t do that, he’d be devastated.	And
I mean... what if he chose Ted?

MICHELLE

Oh come on, you don’t really think that.

LORI

Not really, but what if?

MICHELLE

Well then... things happen for a reason.

TRACY

No they don’t. That’s just something girls say when something bad happens to them that they don’t understand.

GINA

Fuck off, Tracy.
