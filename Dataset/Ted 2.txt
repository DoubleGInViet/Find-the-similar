INT. OFFICE ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS

Lori’s boss REX (asshole handsome, mid-30’s, expensive suit) walks into the office, and approaches the gathering of female employees.

REX

Well hello there. Sorry if I’m interrupting any private girl talk about Channing Tatum’s index finger but Lori I need to see you in my office.

LORI

Actually Rex, I have a lot of work I need to get to--

REX

Oh, this is work, I swear.

LORI
(sigh)
Okay, fine.

Lori follows Rex and gives the girls a “help!” look.

MICHELLE

He’s such an asshole.
 



 
32

CONTINUED:

GINA

Out of control.	Such a sleaze.

TRACY

You guys are so pathetic. You’re shitting on Rex, and you both had sex with him.

Short beat.

GINA/MICHELLE

Like once./I was drunk.

GINA

And so did you.

TRACY

Well, I didn’t want one of you whores getting promoted before me.


INT. REX’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

Lori sits across from Rex, who sits at a large desk.

LORI

So... what do you need to talk to me about, Rex?

Rex takes a framed picture out of a drawer, and shows it to her.

REX

See that? That’s me on the diving team in high school. We dove the shit outta that pool that year. If you look close, you can see the outline of my root.

LORI
(annoyed)
You promised this was about work.

REX

Lori, what is wrong with you? Why don’t you like me? I’m rich, I’m good-looking, my dad owns the company--

LORI

I have a boyfriend, Rex. I think you know this.

REX

Yeah, the guy with the teddy bear, that’s a cute relationship, but I’m talking about being with a real man, Lori.
(MORE)

 
33

CONTINUED:
REX (CONT'D)
Someone who wears a blazer on an
airplane.

LORI
(standing up)
I’m very busy.

REX

Well then, how do you have all that time to be in my head?

LORI

Goodbye, Rex.

Lori exits Rex’s office. Rex casually gets up, strolls over to her chair, nonchalantly brushes his hand on the cushion where she was sitting, and nonchalantly smells his hand.


INT./ ESTAB. CIAO BELLA RESTAURANT, NEWBURY STREET - NIGHT


INT. RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS

John and Lori sit across from each other at a romantically set table. They’ve just finished their meal. John has the remains of a lobster shell on his plate.

LORI
(satisfied sigh)
That was perfect.

A WAITRESS approaches.

WAITRESS
Would you like me to wrap up your
leftovers?

LORI

Oh no, I’m fine, thanks.

John holds up the front portion of the lobster shell, which has the face and eyes on it.

JOHN

Actually, could you wrap just this up for me? I wanna scare the shit outta somebody.

WAITRESS
(beat)
Sure.


 
34

CONTINUED:

The waitress walks away.

LORI
(mildly amused)
What are you, five years old?

JOHN

Yeah, but I read at a six year-old level.

Another WAITER approaches with a bottle of champagne, two glasses, and some chocolate-covered strawberries.

WAITER

Senor. Senora, here is your dessert and champagne.

LORI

Ooh, Cristal.

JOHN

It’s a special night. We’ve been dating for four years.
(taking bottle)

And hey, all those rich black people can’t be wrong, right?

LORI

It doesn’t seem like four years, does it?

JOHN
(affectionately taking her
hand)
No, it doesn’t.

LORI

You had no business being out on that dance floor, but I’m glad you were.


INT. CLUB - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

We see Lori out on the dance floor, amidst a sea of dancing clubgoers. Nearby, we see John dancing with a girl, and doing it very badly. He’s putting too much into it, obviously trying to impress her. The girl is gamely tolerating it, but is clearly not digging the moves. John thrusts his butt back in one move, accidentally bumping a girl behind him with enough force to send her sprawling on the floor. As the crowd reacts to this, we see that it is Lori. She starts to get up, when John turns and rushes to help her to her feet.

JOHN

Oh my god, are you okay? Oh god, I’m so sorry!


 
35

CONTINUED:

LORI
(a little stunned)
Yeah, I’m... I’m fine.

JOHN

Oh Jesus, I’m so so sorry! I didn’t see you! It was an accident!

LORI

Well, yeah, I... I would hope it was an accident.

JOHN

Did you hurt your head?

LORI

Um, yes.	My head hurts a lot.

JOHN

Oh, man.	Here, let me get you some ice.

She sits down. He reaches into a nearby glass, pulls out a handful of ice, and wraps it in a napkin. He puts it against her head. She inhales sharply for a moment.

JOHN (CONT’D)

Sorry.	Does it hurt?

LORI
(beat, noticing him for the
first time)
N... No.	No it’s okay.

JOHN
(beat, noticing too)
I’m... I’m John.

LORI

I’m Lori.

They smile at each other...


INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT (BACK TO SCENE)

LORI

Okay, here’s a question that’ll show how much you actually care about me. You remember we stayed and talked until the place closed, and then we went for late night eggs and waffles, and we stayed there til 5 a.m. watching a movie on the little TV in the diner. Name the movie.
 



 
36

CONTINUED:

JOHN

Octopussy.

LORI

Gold star.

JOHN

But does that show that I care about you, or I care about Roger Moore?

LORI

I’m gonna give you the benefit of the doubt.

JOHN

Thank you. And by the way, my dancing was not that bad.

LORI
(laughing)
Your dancing was bad.

JOHN

I had some cool moves.

LORI

So do people with Parkinson’s.

JOHN

That’s not how I remember it.

LORI

Yeah, how do you remember it?


INT. SMOKY TAVERN - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

We see John leaning against the bar, wearing a white Navy officer’s uniform, a la Ted Stryker in “Airplane!” as “Stayin’ Alive” blasts from the jukebox. ANGLE ON LORI, who is up on the dance floor, done up like Julie Hagerty. John takes his hat off, and tosses it O.S. coolly. He struts up to the dance floor, locks eyes with Lori. They circle one another for a beat. John suavely takes off his jacket, twirls it in the air a few times, and tosses it O.S. He then strikes a “finger up” disco pose, with a bullet SFX. He and Lori begin disco dancing simultaneously. He jumps up, locking his legs around Lori, who spins him around in circles, as we cut back to:


INT. CIAO BELLA RESTAURANT - NIGHT (BACK TO SCENE)

LORI

Whatever you say, baby.


 
37

CONTINUED:

JOHN

Hey, here’s to four more years, huh?

They clink glasses, and take a sip.

JOHN (CONT’D)

Now I know we said no gifts, but--

LORI

No, we didn’t.

JOHN

--But, I got you something anyway, in clear violation of the “no gift” rule.

LORI

There was no such rule.

John reaches into his jacket pocket and pulls out a small box. Lori looks excited.

JOHN

Lori, I’ve wanted to give this to you for a long time.

John slides the box over to Lori. She picks it up.

LORI

Oh, John.

Lori unwraps the box and opens it. Inside is a pair of nice, but not-super-expensive-looking earrings.

JOHN
Those are the ones you liked, right?
From that kiosk at the mall?

LORI

Oh.	Yeah.

JOHN

Check out the card.

She opens up the card, which we see as John describes it. It says, “Happy 4 year anniversary! Love you.”

JOHN (CONT’D)

See, I even wrote the words with different colored markers so you wouldn’t get bored while you were reading it.

LORI
(unenthused)
Great. Thanks. Well, um, here. This is for you.


 
38

CONTINUED:

Lori hands John a small box. He opens it up, revealing a very nice watch.

JOHN
(opens box)
Oh wow, a Hamilton!

He puts it on his wrist.

LORI
I remember you liked it when you saw Tom
Brady wearing one in GQ.

JOHN

Yeah, I mean his was analog, but this is so awesome, I love it!

She reacts a bit to this.

JOHN (CONT’D)
Y’know, Lori...
(indicating box)
Someday, there’s gonna be a ring in there. But I wanna wait ‘til I can get you something really special, y’know? I just don’t have the money right now.

LORI
John, I don’t need the Hope diamond, all
I want is--

JOHN

I know, but it’s important to me that you have the engagement ring you deserve. And what with the credit bubble... the Supreme Court... I mean, look at Haiti.

LORI

Look, I’m only saying this because I love you, but that’s not realistic. You’re never gonna have any kind of a career if you’re always partying and wasting time with Ted.

JOHN

Oh, Jesus, here we go--

LORI

John, please get him to find his own place, so we can get on with our lives.

JOHN

Look, can we talk about this another time, and just enjoy our anniversary dinner?


 
39

CONTINUED:

LORI

Yeah. Fine. Let’s talk about it ten years from now.

JOHN
(rolling his eyes with a
sigh)
Lori, we can’t talk about this every time we go out. Look, he’s been my best friend since I was eight. And I was not a popular child. You have to understand, I had no friends before he came along. He’s the only reason I ever gained any fucking confidence. I coulda wound up like that Asian kid at Virginia Tech, but I didn’t. ‘Cause of him. So, y’know, I’m not that psyched to just, like, kick him out.

LORI

Well, it’s good to know that a talking teddy bear is the only thing that kept you from gunning down your classmates, but John, you’re not eight. You’re thirty-five. And unless you’re too blind to notice, he’s not your only friend anymore. You have me. And I love you.

JOHN

I love you, too.	You know that.

LORI

Look, I’ve put the best physical years of my life into this. I mean, I’m cute now, but in a few years my body’s gonna fall off a fucking cliff. Things’ll be hanging and stretching in ways that might scare a man. I need to feel secure in the fact that you won’t leave me when that happens.

JOHN

Not only will I not leave you, it’s gonna be even better. ‘Cause I can have sex with you, and press your arm fat against a comic book so I can see it backwards.

She laughs.	So does he.

LORI

And, my boobs and vagina will all be in the same place, so that’s a lot less movin’ around for you.
 



 
40

CONTINUED:

JOHN

I can do it all with one hand.

LORI

Exactly, and you can do whatever you want with the other hand.

JOHN

I can write a novel.	Maybe a bestseller.

LORI

We can achieve critical acclaim and become rich just by screwing each other.

They both laugh hard.

JOHN

Well, I hope these jokes have distracted you from the actual problems in our relationship.

LORI
(sigh)
We can’t put the real conversation off forever, John.

JOHN

I dunno, I got a lotta fuckin’ jokes.



EXT. JOHN AND LORI’S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Their car pulls up.	They start to get out.

JOHN
(noticing)
Ah shit, hang on, my phone fell under the seat somewhere. Can you call it?

Lori punches his number on her cellphone. After a beat, we hear The Imperial March from “The Empire Strikes Back.”

LORI

That’s my ringtone?

JOHN
(laughs, embarrassed)
Oh, yeah...

LORI

What is it?	It sounds negative.
 



 
41

CONTINUED:

JOHN

No, it’s from The Notebook.

He reaches under the seat, fishing for the phone, as she goes inside.

JOHN (CONT’D)
(straining)
This is gonna take some doin’.

LORI

All right, well I’ll see you upstairs.

He continues digging for the phone, as she walks inside.


INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Lori walks toward the apartment, but stops as she hears loud music coming from inside. She approaches the door cautiously and opens it, revealing...


INT. JOHN AND LORI’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

Lori enters a haze of pot smoke, and a very much trashed apartment (empty bottles, wrappers, etc.). Ted sits on the sofa with a small group of trashy-looking women.

They’re watching “Romancing the Stone,” which plays very loudly on the TV.

LORI

What the hell is all this?!

TED

Lori! Hey, you’re home early! The ladies and I were just watching “Romancing the Stone.” Got it on Blu-Ray. Came in a two-pack with “Jewel of the Nile,” but I don’t know that we’ll end up watchin’ that one.

LORI

This place is a wreck! Who are these girls?

TED

Oh, where are my manners? Lori, this is Angelique, Heavenly, Cherene, and Sauvignon Blanc. I love you girls. Y’know, somewhere out there are four terrible fathers I wish I could thank for this great night.

The girls ad-lib “Hello,” “Nice to meet you,” etc.


 
42

CONTINUED:

Lori glances around the room, then SCREAMS as she sees something in the corner.

LORI

What is that?!!!

TED

What’s what?

LORI

There is... a shit in the corner! On the floor! There’s a shit!

TED
(looking over)
Oh man, that’s what Dierdre was doin’ over there in the corner for so long. Remember, she was crouched over there and I thought she was just makin’ a call or somethin’--

LORI

There is a shit!!	On my floor!!

TED

Yeah, she’s passed out in the bathroom now, she seemed like she was hopped up on somethin’. I mean, mystery solved, I guess--

LORI

What the fuck!!!!

TED

Lori, if I can-- now this is just speculation, but... is it possible that this is not so much about the stool in the corner, and more about maybe tonight’s dinner not measuring up to your expectations?

LORI

What!!!	The fuck!!!

Lori is speechless with rage. At that moment, we see the lobster head poke in aggressively from behind the door.

JOHN (V.O.)

RAAARRRR!!

TED
(pointing)
Ahaaaaa!
 



 
43

CONTINUED:

JOHN (V.O., AS LOBSTER) Who lives here? I’m comin’ to get whoever lives here! You owe me lobster money!

TED
(to girl)
Hahaaa! That’s my friend John. Not the lobster, the guy runnin’ it.

At that moment, John enters, holding his cell phone.

JOHN

Found my phone.

He stops, seeing everyone there.

JOHN (CONT’D)
What’s goin’ on?
(then, noticing)
Is that a shit?


INT./ESTAB. NEW ENGLAND AQUARIUM - AFTERNOON


INT. NEW ENGLAND AQUARIUM - SAME

Ted and John walk slowly down the ramp circling the massive see-through tank, occasionally stopping to observe some of the more bizarre varieties of fish. John is oddly restrained. Something is on his mind. As they stroll, we see a nearby man keeping an eye on them. He seems much more interested in them than in the fish. This, we will find out later, is DONNY...

TED

God, there are some fucked up fish out there.

JOHN

Yeah.

TED

Jesus, look at that one. Mister tough guy fish.
(tough guy voice:)

“Hey!  Whatsa big idea?  Cold fusion? Well that is a big idea, I beg pardon!” Look at that guy.  WASP-y white guy fish. (tight-ass white guy voice:)

“I don’t care for some of Conan O’Brien’s humor. I don’t like Irish humor. And this food is too flavorful. I don’t care for flavor in my food.”
(MORE)

 
44

TED (CONT'D)
(switching to goofy voice as
a bottle-nosed fish swims
by)
“Oh hey, sorry I’m late, guys. Hey, where’s everybody goin’? Any of you guys got a tissue? I’m allergic to water.”

JOHN

Ted... you gotta move out.

Ted turns and stares at John for a beat.

TED

Wh... what?

JOHN

It’s... it’s gotta happen.

Ted sits down on a bench, a little stunned and dazed.

TED

What...what did I do?

John looks heartbroken at this response.


INT. NEW ENGLAND AQUARIUM - MOMENTS LATER

Ted and John sit side-by-side on a bench next to the penguin habitat.

JOHN

Ted, my relationship is at a very delicate stage, and, y’know, Lori and I may just need a little space right now. Plus a hooker took a shit in our apartment.

TED

Hey, look, that was a tough night for all of us.


INT. JOHN AND LORI’S APARTMENT - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

Lori is staring at the O.S. poop in the corner. She is trying to pick it up with a shoebox. In the background, we can see an almost panicky, grossed-out John peering out from behind the bathroom door.

LORI
(beyond disgusted)
Oh, god!!
 



 
45

CONTINUED:

JOHN

Aaaa, what?!

LORI

It’s so gross!!

JOHN

Don’t tell me, I don’t wanna hear about it! Did you get it?

LORI

No!	Oh my god!

JOHN

Tell me when you get it!

LORI

AAAA, I got some on my thumb!

JOHN

AAAAA! You can never cook with that hand again! I’m serious, learn to cook other-handed!

LORI

Shit!

JOHN

I’ll get the next one, okay?


INT. NEW ENGLAND AQUARIUM - DAY

TED

She’s makin’ you do it, isn’t she?

JOHN
(giving up the bullshit)
Yes. But, that doesn’t mean we can’t hang out. We’ll hang out all the time!

TED
What about... thunder buddies for life,
Johnny?

JOHN

I know. Fuck. I just don’t know what to do here. I know it sucks, but otherwise I’m gonna lose her. And I do love her, Ted.

TED
(sigh)
I know you do, Johnny.
 


 
46

CONTINUED:

JOHN
I’ll help you get on your feet out there,
I promise.

TED

And we’ll hang out a lot, right?

JOHN

Fuck, all the time.

TED
(arms wide for a hug)
Bring it over here.

John hugs Ted. Ted hugs him back. We hear a squeak, and a high-pitched recorded voice saying “I wuv you.” John and Ted pull away from each other uncomfortably.

TED (CONT’D)	JOHN
That was the-- the thing--	The old-- Yeah-- no, I know-
that doesn’t mean-- I’m not	-
gay.

JOHN

We’ve got to get you a job.


EXT./ ESTAB. GROCERY STORE - LATE AFTERNOON		
EXT. GROCERY STORE - SAME		
John and Ted head toward the store.  Ted is dressed in a		
coat and tie, and looks very uncomfortable.		
TED		
I look stupid.		
JOHN		
No, you don’t.  You look dapper.		
TED	*	
I look like Snuggles’ accountant.		
They pause as John straightens Ted’s tie.		
JOHN		
Look, I know it sucks, but you gotta make		
some money so you can pay for an		
apartment.		
TED		
I don’t wanna work at a grocery store.		

 


 
47

CONTINUED:

JOHN

Well, you have no skills.

TED

I told you, I can totally be a lawyer.

JOHN

As I said, you would need a law degree from a law school.

TED

I’m a special case. I’m a fucking talking bear. They might make an exception ‘cause they’re all like, “Aaa! This bear can talk and do stuff! Let’s give him a job and maybe he’ll give us a few laughs,” but then they’re surprised at what a stellar performance I’m turnin’ in. And then they practically have to give me the Anderson case.

JOHN
Look, you get the job, and we’ll
celebrate after.

John discreetly pulls out a baggie of weed.

TED

And if I don’t get the job will we still smoke that pot?

JOHN

Probably, yes.

TED
(patting John on the leg)
Yeah.	Okay, good speech, coach.


INT. GROCERY STORE MANAGER’S OFFICE - SHORTLY AFTER

Ted sits opposite FRANK, the grocery store manager. We see his name and title on a desk nameplate. Frank sits at the desk, staring at Ted.

FRANK

So.	You think you got what it takes?

TED

Nope.

FRANK
(a beat, then)
No one’s ever talked to me like that before. You’re hired.


 
48

CONTINUED:

TED

Shit.


EXT. BOSTON COMMON - LATE AFTERNOON

(Over music:) John and Ted walk across the Common, passing various park-goers. The occasional person notices and points with a “Hey, isn’t that...” sort of look. They passes three cute girls who flag Ted down. Two pose with him as the third takes their picture with her cellphone. Ted poses for the photo with one hand on the girl’s breast. She laughs hard. Ted waves goodbye, and he and John make their way over to a park bench. They sit. John takes out the weed, looks around for a beat, then starts to discreetly roll a joint.

TED

Well, I’m a former celebrity with a minimum wage job. This must be what the cast of Different Strokes feels like.

O.S. VOICE

Excuse me.

John and Ted react, startled. John stuffs the weed in his pocket, accidentally dropping the buds in the rolling papers on the ground.

ANGLE ON a creepy-looking man glancing at them repeatedly. This is Donny, the fat kid we saw in the prologue. He has grown up into a thinner but no less creepy man.

DONNY

I’m sorry to bother you, but my son and I couldn’t help but admire your teddy bear.

ADJUST TO REVEAL his son, who looks exactly like fat young Donny from earlier.

JOHN
(a little uncomfortable)
Oh.	Um, thank you.

DONNY

I’m Donny. And this is my boy, Robert. I have to tell you, I’ve been fascinated by your story ever since I was a boy. I remember seeing you on the Carson show. You were just wonderful.

BRIEF ANGLE ON the ground, where a pigeon is pecking at the dropped weed.
 


 
49

CONTINUED:

TED

Yeah, that was ah... that was a good time.

DONNY
(to John)
I wonder, is there any chance I could purchase the bear from you? For my son?

JOHN/TED

Huh? / Excuse me?

ROBERT
(calm)
I want it.

TED

Hey, I’m not an “it”, pal. I’m a “he.”

JOHN
(leaning down to his level)
I’m sorry, little guy, but my bear isn’t for sale. I’ve had him since I was about your age. He’s very special to me.

ROBERT

Sit up straight when you talk to me.

JOHN
(recoiling)
Ew, why the fuck did he say that?

DONNY

Don’t swear in front of my child. Now. We are very interested in the bear. If you’d like to work out some sort of arrangement, here’s my address and phone number.

He writes on a slip of paper and hands it to John. John smiles awkwardly and puts it in his wallet.

JOHN

Okay. Will do. Here it goes, in the really important pocket for really important stuff.

Donny and Robert walk off. Donny turns and steals a glance back at Ted as they move off.

TED

Wow. Can you imagine what that little shit would do to me?
 



 
50

CONTINUED:

JOHN

Oh man, I can totally see him just taking you down to the basement and really slowly de-limbing you while singing some creepy Victorian nursery rhyme.

John tugs on one of Ted’s arms trying to creep him out.

He then breaks into a creepy falsetto.

JOHN (CONT’D)
OH, MY LITTLE SIXPENCE/MY PRETTY LITTLE
SIXPENCE/I LOVE MY SIXPENCE BETTER THAN
MY LIFE.

TED

Fuck you. Why do you have to take it so far? Now it’s real. Fuck you again for that. C’mon, let’s go find a better place to get stoned.

They exit. After a beat, the pigeon flies into frame, slamming right into a fucking tree.


EXT. ESTAB. A SHITTY APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

John and Ted walk into the building. John carries two cardboard boxes, and Ted carries one smaller one.

INT. AN ALMOST EMPTY APARTMENT - SAME

There’s a couch, a coffee table, and a couple of boxes. John and Ted put down their boxes, and stand just inside the doorway.

JOHN

Well... I guess this is it, huh?

TED

Yeah, sure is.

JOHN

First night on your own.

TED

Yeah. First night in my beautiful new apartment. They say they’re ain’t hardly been no murders here.

They awkwardly nod to each other, both knowing that John must leave soon.

JOHN

Okay... so... if you need anything...


 
51

CONTINUED:

TED

I know.

JOHN

Seriously, anything...

TED

I know. I’ll be fine, Johnny.

JOHN
(beat)
I know you will, buddy.

They regard each other for a moment, then John slowly turns and walks off down the hall. He turns back to smile and wave. From John’s POV, we see a diminutive-looking Ted give a wan wave back. He looks very alone as the camera recedes.

INT. JOHN AND LORI’S LIVING ROOM - DAY

John sits on the couch, putting his tie on as he watches TV. Lori comes over and sits down next to him.

LORI

Hey there.

JOHN

Hey.

LORI

Listen... I just wanna say thank you. What you did with Ted was a big step, and I know it wasn’t easy, but I just want you to know that I love you for it. And, I think this a new beginning for our relationship.

JOHN

Hey, anything for you. This is all part of the new grown up, adult John Bennett. So, get used to him.

She gives him a kiss, and starts to undo his tie.

LORI

Y’know, I don’t have to be at work for another twenty minutes...

JOHN
(guiding her down onto the
couch)
Ooh, that’s perfect, I’m only gonna need one.
 


 
52

CONTINUED:

She laughs, and they kiss.

LORI

You know what my favorite thing about you is? After four years, you can still surprise me. To step up and change such a big part of your life just to make your girlfriend happier... I dunno, I bet you most guys couldn’t do it.

JOHN

Most guys don’t have you to motivate ‘em.

LORI

I’m sorry if I was pushy about it...

JOHN

No, you were right! Look, the reason I love you so much is the same reason I guess I take you for granted sometimes. It’s ‘cause you’re... inevitable.

LORI
(huh?)
Inevitable. Well, that’s... romantic? I think?

JOHN

No, what I mean is, there’s just no version of this universe where you and I don’t end up together. You’re inevitable.

LORI
That sounds like something Stephen
Hawking would say to his girlfriend.

JOHN

But do you get what I’m saying?

LORI

Yeah, I do. And I feel exactly the same way about you.

They kiss.

LORI (CONT’D)
(smiling coyly, as she
notices)
Ooh. Is that a Flash Gordon ray gun in your pocket or are you glad to see me?

John pulls the Flash Gordon gun out of his pocket and shows it to her. She cracks up.

EXT./ESTAB. GROCERY STORE - DAY


INT. GROCERY STORE - SAME

Ted is at his station, finishing checking out a customer.

TED

Thank you, please come again, we have a lot more groceries.

The customer exits. Ted sighs with boredom. He turns to ELLEN, the large African-American woman at the next station.

TED (CONT’D)

Hey Ellen?

ELLEN

Yeah?

TED

Who’s that over there?

ANGLE ON A VERY ATTRACTIVE blonde girl bagging groceries a few aisles away (This is TAMI-LYNN).

ELLEN

That’s the new bag girl. I don’t know her name, but she seems cute.

TED

Yeah. Very cute. You know what I’d like to do to her? Somethin’ I call a Dirty Fozzie.

Ted waves to the girl. She waves back. He makes a kissy face at her. She giggles and blows him a kiss back. He pantomimes hard, thrusting, standing-up sex. Her eyes widen for a beat, as she stares, then smiles. He grabs an Oh Henry bar, and pantomimes fellatio. The girl laughs hysterically. CLOSE ANGLE on Ted, as white liquid sprays all over his face from one side, then from the other. WIDEN to reveal he’s squirting two bottles of pump hand soap on either side of him. The girl laughs and shakes her head “no.”

TED (CONT’D)
(to himself)
Okay, so that’s where we’ll draw the line.
 


EXT. ESTAB./ LIBERTY RENT-A-CAR - DAY
 
54


INT. LIBERTY RENT-A-CAR - SAME

John sits at his workstation, playing a TBD video game on his iPhone. Tanya approaches.

TANYA

Hey.	How you holding up?

JOHN

Oh, I’m all right. Just... getting used to things, that’s all.

TANYA

It’s gonna be all right. Y’know, I went through something like this with my last boyfriend.

JOHN

Really?

TANYA

Yeah, we were dating for eight months, and I was really in love with him, and then he was deported back to Iran. So, I get it.

JOHN

Oh... yeah. So... I guess we both lost our furry little guy.

TANYA

Yeah.

John’s phone rings the theme from “Knight Rider.” He sees Ted’s name pop up, with a photo of Ted smiling open-mouthed at the camera, with his arms outstretched and a bra on his head. John picks up.

JOHN

Hey, Ted.

TED (V.O.)

Johnny. What are you doin’? You wanna come over and catch a buzz?

JOHN

I could probably swing by after work.

TED (V.O.)

Fuck that, I traded off yesterday, so I got the night shift. C’mon, I’m bored as crap over here, just swing by for a bit.

CONTINUED:

JOHN

I can’t just ditch work, man. Look, I’m trying to get my shit together and be an adult here, y’know? For Lori’s sake.


INT. TED’S BATHROOM - DAY

Ted sits in the tub, talking on the phone. He has suds in his hair, and there are a couple of little toy boats in the water. From here, we intercut back and forth from him and John.

TED

John. Five minutes. And then I’ll kick you out, I promise. C’mon, I picked up the “Cheers” DVD box set, and supposedly everybody talks shit about each other in the interviews.

JOHN

Really?

TED
Yeah, and apparently George Wendt
confesses to a rape.

JOHN
(beat)
Sometimes adults get high.

TED

They do, John.	Sometimes they do.

JOHN

You’ll kick me out in five.

TED (V.O.)

John, I have to kick you out. I am extraordinarily busy today, I have so much teddy bear paperwork to get through, it is retarded. Five minutes and you’re outta here.

John turns and looks back at Thomas in his office.

JOHN

What do I tell Thomas?

TED

Just tell him you don’t feel well.
 
56


INT. THOMAS’ OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

John stands in front of Thomas, who sits at his desk.

JOHN

I gotta duck out for a bit. Lori tried to break up a dog fight, and I guess she got hurt pretty bad.

THOMAS

Oh my god.

JOHN

Yeah, she’s-- that’s the way she is, she sees trouble, she tries to help out, and I guess one of these dogs clamped his jaws on her forearm, and he wouldn’t let go until the fireman showed up and had to stick his finger in his ass.

THOMAS

Jesus, John.

JOHN

Yeah, she’s pretty shook up.

THOMAS
Oh my god.
(beat)
Up the dog’s ass, right?

JOHN

Yeah, that’s how they--

THOMAS

That’s how they get ‘em to stop biting, sure.

JOHN

Yeah.

THOMAS

Go go go, take care of it, let me know how she is.

JOHN

Oh gosh, thank you, sir.	I owe you one.

THOMAS

You don’t owe me anything, go.

John smiles wanly, and exits.

THOMAS (CONT’D)
(looking at his own finger)
Jesus.


EXT./ ESTAB. TED’S NEW APARTMENT - DAY


INT. TED’S NEW APARTMENT - SAME

ANGLE ON THE TV - Ted Danson sits in a chair, being interviewed.

TED DANSON

Was there cocaine on the set of “Cheers”? Hm. Lemme figure out the best way to answer that. Um...are there naked dicks in gay porn?
(laughs warmly)
Yes, there was quite a lot of cocaine. I mean, it was the eighties. And I was king. I was king of the eighties. I was Ted fucking Danson. And not only that, I was Sam fucking Mayday Malone. Was I popular? Gee, lemme think: are there naked dicks in gay porn?
(laughs warmly)
Yes, I was quite beloved.

ANGLE ON Ted and John watching.	They have a bong.

JOHN

You know, he’s exactly who you want him to be.

TED

He is. He is. Someone the likes of which we should all aspire to become.

ANGLE BACK ON TV -

TED DANSON

Woody Harrelson. Smallest dick I’ve ever seen on a man.

ANGLE BACK ON John and Ted -

TED
(passing him bong)
Here, try this stuff. I told my guy to step it up, and he gave me this.

JOHN

What is it?
 


 
58

CONTINUED:

TED
It’s called Kennedy’s Head.	It’s
actually pretty mellow.

JOHN

That doesn’t sound very mellow.

TED

No, it’s-- it makes you cerebral. Like Kennedy. Kennedy was smart. That’s what it refers to. Decisions under pressure. Cuban missile crisis. Go on, spark it up.

John takes a hit off the bong, then glances around.

JOHN

Y’know, this place looks great.

TED

Yeah, it’s all Ikea. Did the whole apartment for 47 dollars.

JOHN

How are the neighbors?

TED

There’s an Asian family next door, but they don’t have a gong or nothin’, so it’s fine.

JOHN

That’s lucky.

TED

How’s work?

JOHN

Sucks.

TED

Ah.

JOHN

You?

TED

It’s actualy not bad. Met a girl. She’s a bagger.

JOHN

No way, that’s awesome. We should double date, you, me Lori and, what’s her name?
 



 
59

CONTINUED:

TED

White trash name.	Guess.

JOHN

Uh, Mandy?

TED

Nope.

JOHN

Madison?

TED

Nope.

JOHN

Britney, Tiffany, Candice?

TED

Nope.

JOHN

Don’t fuck with me on this. I know this shit.

TED

I know you do, and I am not fucking with you.

JOHN
Okay, Brandi, Heather, Channing, Breanna,
Amber, Sabrina, Melody, Dakota, Sierra,
Bambi, Crystal, Samantha, Autumn, Ruby,
Taylor, Tara, Tamra, Tami, Lauren,
Charlene, Chantel, Courtney, Misty,
Jenna, Krista, Mindy, Noelle, Shelby,
Trina, Reba, Cassandra, Nikki, Kelsey,
Shawna, Jolene, Earline, Claudine,

JOHN

Okay, was it any one of those names with a Lynn after it?

TED

Yep.

JOHN

Okay. Brandi-Lynn, Heather-Lynn--
 



 
60

CONTINUED:

TED

Tami-Lynn.

JOHN

Fuck!


EXT. ESTAB. RESTAURANT - NIGHT


INT. RESTAURANT - SAME

John, Ted, Lori and Ted’s dolled-up and sort of trashy date Tami-Lynn (the bag girl from the grocery store) eat dinner.

TAMI-LYNN

See, I was all pissed off ‘cause me and my friend Danielle were supposed to go skydiving last year, but then she got pregnant from this asshole guy, and so we couldn’t go and I was all upset, but then she had a miscarriage, and so we ended up getting to go skydiving, and it was so scary but it was so much fun.

JOHN

Hey, well... it sounds like everything worked out then.

TAMI-LYNN

I guess god wanted me to go skydiving, y’know?

LORI

Jesus.

TAMI-LYNN

Or Jesus, yeah, but whatever.

TED

Hey, isn’t this great? The four of us here, having dinner together? Lori, how’ve you been? Haven’t seen you in forever.

LORI

Um, I’ve been good. Not much going on. My company’s 20th anniversary is next week, that’s something.

JOHN
(proud, to Tami-Lynn)
Lori’s a senior VP at a big PR firm.
 


 
61

CONTINUED:

LORI

It’s not that big a deal.

TED

Company’s turnin’ 20, eh? So you can bang it but you can’t get it drunk.

Tami-Lynn laughs heartily at this, as does John. Lori isn’t quite as delighted.

LORI
(visibly annoyed)
I’m surprised John didn’t tell you already. Seems like you guys have seen each other every day since you moved out.

TED

Well, it’s funny, usually the first item on our agenda is “what’s goin’ on with Lori?” So I’m surprised that one slipped through the cracks.

JOHN

We do, we talk about you all the time.

TED

Right?

JOHN

Oh my god, remember, Ted, last week we were talking about... how... neat all of Lori’s shoes are?

TED

That was a lengthy conversation.

JOHN

And we were saying like, a lot of women look like unsteady horses when they wear high heels, but Lori has a sort of... regal... trot.

TED

A canter.

JOHN

Oh my god yes.	You canter.

Lori stares at him for a beat, then:

LORI

So, Tami, where are you from? Tell us about yourself. I’m always... fascinated to meet Ted’s girlfriends.
 


 
62

CONTINUED:

TAMI-LYNN
What do you mean girlfriends?
(to Ted)
Is there like a lot of ‘em or somethin’?

TED

No, no, that’s not what she’s sayin’ at all, right Lori?

LORI

No, right, I was-- all I was doing was asking. Ted’s very... attractive, I’m just always interested in the... type of girl that can snatch him up.

TAMI-LYNN

Did you just call me a whore?

LORI

What?	No, I--

TAMI-LYNN

You just worry about your own snatch, how ‘bout that, honey?

TED/JOHN

Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! / What the hell happened? We’re havin’ a friendly meal here!

TAMI-LYNN

Don’t talk shit to me!

LORI

I was just asking a question.

TAMI-LYNN

You’re a friggin’ snob! You think you’re all cool cause you work at some fancy shit place!

TED
It’s okay, Tami.
(to Lori)
Nice, Lori. Real nice.

LORI
What?! It’s not my fault she can’t speak
English.

TAMI-LYNN

Fuck you! Just ‘cause you’re all in the business world and shit, you think everyone’s supposed to like, suck your asshole!


 
63

CONTINUED:

TED

Baby! Baby! Baby. Baby. Let’s get outta here. We’ll go back to my place for a couple vodka and strawberry Quiks. Okay? See ya, John.

Ted and Tami Lynn exit leaving John and Lori at the table.
