LORI

What a cunt.

JOHN
(covering ears in pain)
Ooh!	I hate that word.

LORI

Huh?

JOHN

That word is so sharp. It’s like an electric sword, slashing everything in its path.

LORI

Well, you didn’t exactly stick up for me.

JOHN

I... I’m trying to walk a line here, I want to be fair to you and to him, y’know?

LORI

Yeah, well, I think you’re being a little more fair to him.

JOHN
(scoffing)
Come on.

LORI

Y’know, your boss called this morning and asked me how my arm was.

JOHN
(caught)
Oh?

LORI

Yeah. Because of the dog fight I tried to break up.

JOHN

Ohh...
 


 
64

CONTINUED:

LORI

If I had to hazard a guess, I’d say that was some bullshit lie you made up so you could take off work and go to Ted’s. Am I right?

JOHN
(beat)
I... I made you out to be a hero.

LORI

John, Ted moved out so we could give ourselves a chance without him. You’re not really giving anything a chance if you’re blowing off work to get high with your teddy bear.

JOHN

It won’t happen again, I promise.

LORI
(with a bit of anger)
Yes.	It will.

A beat.	She sighs.

LORI (CONT’D)

I wanna break up.

JOHN
(thrown)
W... What?

LORI

I’m just... I’m done. This isn’t gonna work. We’re in two different places.

JOHN

Lori, look, I know--

LORI

You promised me you were gonna grow up and take our life together seriously.

JOHN

Hey, Ted moved out, didn’t he? I did that for you-- for us! And it wasn’t easy.

LORI

Jesus, he might as well still be living with us, John. You spend more time with him than you do with me.
 



 
65

CONTINUED:

JOHN

Okay, look. I’ve been getting stoned too much. I know that. I’ve been bumming around with Ted too much, I know that, too. Give me one more chance, I promise I can fix it. Lori, I love you too much, please give me one more chance.

LORI
(beat)
I need a man, John. Not a boy with a teddy bear.

JOHN

I know. Done. Man, right here in front of you. Look at these pecs. Man pecs. Look at the hair on my upper lip. Man hair. I just farted. Man fart.

Lori can’t help but let a small laugh escape. She softens a bit...

LORI
John... this really is your last chance.
I can’t do this anymore.

JOHN

You won’t have to. Trust me. I love you.

He kisses her.

LORI
(beat)
Okay.

JOHN

Aw, sweetie, I love you so much! You won’t be sorry, I swear.

She smiles at him, then:

LORI

Did you really just fart?

JOHN

Yeah, but I pushed it that way with my hand.

LORI

Oh.	Wonder where it’ll hit first.

WIDER ANGLE on the restaurant. For a moment, nothing happens.
 


 
66

CONTINUED:

Then, a guy at a table on the right (sitting with a couple other men and women) screams into his napkin, followed by his dining companions.

GUY AT TABLE
(furious)
Who did this to us?!

GUY #2 AT TABLE
(furious)
God dammit!	I’m here on business!


EXT./ESTAB. GROCERY STORE - DAY


INT. GROCERY STORE - DAY

Ted’s boss, Frank, emerges from the back, writing on a clipboard. He looks up, and his expression turns to confused anger as he sees an unusually long line at Ellen’s register.

FRANK

What the hell?

He walks over to the line. A GUY IN LINE turns and notices him.

GUY IN LINE

Hey, dude, you think you could open more than one register? There’s like a thousand people here!

FRANK

There’s supposed to be three registers open, for god’s sake!

He looks around, aggravated, for a moment, then storms off toward the back. He looks around the butcher’s counter and produce area, then walk into the back storeroom.


INT. STOREROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Frank opens the door, and reacts with shock. REVERSE ANGLE where we see Ted on top of Tami Lynn, who is almost naked. He is doing a very close approximation of banging her wildly. We see his furry bear butt pumping away, with its little tail on the end. Frank screams in shock and horror.
 
67


INT. FRANK’S OFFICE - SHORTLY AFTER

Frank sits at his desk, addressing Ted.

FRANK

You had sexual intercourse with a coworker in a storeroom filled with produce that we sell to the public.

TED

Yes.

FRANK
(beat)
That took guts. We need guts. I’m promoting you.

TED

Oh.


EXT. GROCERY STORE - LATER THAT NIGHT

We see the “CLOSED” sign on the door. Ted exits, finishing off a bottle of beer. He walks around to the dumpster alley, and lines up for a Kareem-style sky hook shot into a trash can. He takes the shot:

TED

Kareem!

The bottle smashes off the side of the can, and shatters.

TED (CONT’D)

You suck, Kareem.

We hear a soft footstep somewhere O.S. Ted turns and looks around. There appears to be no one in the darkness.

TED (CONT’D)

Hello?

No answer. He looks around for a beat, and finds nothing. He turns... and finds himself facing Donny, who stands eerily lit by a single outdoor wall bulb.

DONNY

Hello, Ted.

TED

Gah!	Uh... hi there.

DONNY

Are you all alone out here?


 
68

CONTINUED:

TED

Uh... no. No I’m not. I’m... you know, you’re never alone when you’re with Christ.

DONNY

You know, Robert and I could give you a very, very good home.

TED

I’m... I’m pretty happy where I am. I just got a shitty new apartment--

DONNY

I can offer you six thousand dollars in railroad bonds. They were left to me by my father.

TED

Well, gosh, you know, since I just returned from active duty in the Civil War, that sounds really appealing. Oh wait, no, that was a hundred and fifty years ago, and I don’t give a shit.

Tami-Lynn approaches.

TAMI-LYNN

Teddy, come on-- we’re gonna have pop tarts and cigarettes with my mom before she goes to work.

TED
Yeah, I’m comin’, sweetheart.
(to Donny)
Yeah, my dance card is quite full, so I’m gonna have to decline.

DONNY

I really wish you wouldn’t...

TED

Yeah, sorry. But, ah... you know, I’d like to thank you for creepin’ up my night, and... Jesus be with you. In Christ.

Ted hurries off. ANGLE ON DONNY, who looks eerily determined.
 
69


EXT./ ESTAB. REX’S HOUSE - NIGHT

John and Lori walk up to the fabulously expansive house in Cambridge. It’s a very impressive estate with no expense spared.

LORI
(smiling at him warmly)
I’m glad you’re here.

JOHN

Yeah, me too. Is it cool if I kick your boss’ ass? That won’t affect your workplace chemistry, will it?

LORI

Play nice.	Please.

Rex throws open the door.

REX

There she is! I was worried you weren’t coming!
(to John)

Hi kiddo, how ya doin’? Where’s your bunny rabbit?

JOHN

He’s a bear.

REX
(ushering them in)
Got it. “Hey, this house is fucking huge!” I know guys, try not to get lost.


INT. REX’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

The party is a very costly-looking event: uniformed servers walking around with trays of cocktails and hors d’ouvres, tables laden with lavish-looking food displays and floral arrangements, a 20-piece big band, and hundreds of guests. A large banner reads “Happy 20th Anniversary, Plymouth Public Relations.”

REX

Oh, here come the ladies.

Gina, Michelle, and Tracy approach. Everyone adlibs their hellos to John and Lori. A waiter walks by with a tray of champagne. Lori and the girls each take a glass.
 






 
70

CONTINUED:

REX (CONT’D)

Say listen, why don’t John and I give you gals a chance to talk tampax while we go grab a drink at the bar, huh?

LORI

Sure.


INT. REX’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS - STAIRS AND UPSTAIRS

Rex and John are walking up the stairs to the second floor of his house. Rex points out various items bought at auction. John is visibly unenthused. He does not like this guy, and definitely does not trust him.

REX

...and that’s a Wade Boggs autographed bat. Just barely outbid Phil Donahue for that at auction.

JOHN

Wow, cool.

REX

Yeah, cool. And those boxing gloves were worn by Joe Louis in his first fight.
(passing an abstract
painting)

This is art. Do you get it? (passing wall mounted pair of glasses) )

These were John Lennon’s glasses. Worth about two million dollars.

(passing photo on wall) ) That’s me and Tom Skerritt. Oh, and check this out.

Rex indicates a small, bronze-colored item on a stand.

REX (CONT’D)

See that?	Know what that is?

JOHN
(touching it)
No.

REX

That’s Lance Armstrong’s nut.

John quickly pulls his hand away.

REX (CONT’D)

Something, isn’t it? Had it freeze-dried and bronzed.
(MORE)

 
71

CONTINUED:
REX (CONT’D)

Every now and then, when I feel like my life’s gettin’ me down and things are tough, I just come in here and look at it, and it reminds me that things aren’t so bad. That some people have it worse than me. I mean, he’s only got one ball, and I have three. One of them, of course, being his.

JOHN

That’s inspiring. You’ve led a rich life.

REX
I’ve fucked the shit outta life.
(then)
So talk to me, Goose. How are things with you and Lori?

JOHN

Things are great, actually.

REX

That’s good, that’s good.

JOHN

You know... Lori would hate me for saying this, but... she’s told me how you are at the office, and... as one gentleman to another, I just wanna say I really hope you fucking get Lou Gehrig’s disease.

REX

Whoa, whoa, okay, look, I think I oughtta just clear the air here a little. I...
just want you to know that... I mean, yeah, I’m kind of a “fun-time boss” and whatnot, but... look man, I do that with everybody at the office! I’m just a kook! I have no designs on your girlfriend. We work together, and that’s it. I think you’re a great guy and she’s very lucky.

John is a bit surprised, not unpleasantly so, to hear this.

JOHN

Well... that’s good to hear.

REX

Well, that’s how it is, so...there we go.

JOHN

Okay.


 
72

CONTINUED:

REX

Yeah.

They stand there for a beat, looking at Lance Armstrong’s nut. John’s phone rings the “Knight Rider” theme. John answers it.

JOHN

Hey, Ted.

INTERCUT PERIODICALLY BETWEEN JOHN AND TED, who stands in the foreground with one finger in his ear. In the background, we see a party in full swing.

TED (V.O.)

Johnny!	You gotta get over here, man!

JOHN

Why?	What’s going on?

TED (V.O.)

I’m havin’ a little impromptu thing with some people, and John... Sam Jones is here.

JOHN

What?!

TED (V.O.)

Sam Jones. Flash fucking Gordon. Is here.

JOHN

Holy shit!	How?


INT. TED’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

TED

Remember I said, my buddy’s cousin is friends with Sam Jones? My buddy’s in town with his cousin and who’s with ‘em? Sam Jones!!


INT. REX’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

TED (V.O.)
Sam Jones is here, and John...
(softly, into phone)
...his hair is parted down the middle.

JOHN
(equally softly)
Just like in the movie.


 
73

CONTINUED:

TED

Get over here.

JOHN

Fuck! I can’t... I’m with Lori. I’m already on probation here.

John looks down at the main area of the party, and sees Lori happily chatting with her co-workers.

JOHN (CONT’D)
(agonized)
I just... I can’t.


INT. TED’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

TED

John. There are moments in a man’s life: Nathan Hale, “I regret that I have but one life to give for my country.” Alan Hale, “Yes, I accept the role of the Skipper on ‘Gilligan’s Island.’”


INT. REX’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

TED (V.O.)

John, this is your Alan Hale moment. For god’s sake, come share this with me.

JOHN
(beat, then:)
I’m coming.

John hangs up.

JOHN (CONT’D)

Rex. I gotta go. I’ll be back in thirty minutes tops, but Lori cannot find out. She absolutely cannot know I was gone. If you can cover for me... we’re cool on all that other stuff.

REX
I got your back, my friend.	Been there.
She’ll never know.

JOHN

This is one man to another. I don’t really know you, but I’m trusting you. As a man. This is serious. Can I trust you?
 



 
74

CONTINUED:

REX

Dude. One man to another. I got you on this.

JOHN
(relaxing somewhat)
Okay.	Thank you.

John races O.S.... and Rex raises his scotch glass to his

mouth.

REX
(smiling)
I’m gonna make traditional to your girlfriend. And then fuck her in the ass. All right. We have a game plan.


EXT. REX’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

The “Football Fight” music from “Flash Gordon” starts playing, as John bolts O.S.


EXT. REX’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

John sprints out of the house and runs down the walkway. He leaps over a hedge toward the parking area. He slides across the hood of Lori’s car, gets in, quickly starts the car, and backs out.


EXT. BOSTON (VARIOUS) - NIGHT

CUT TO various shots of John racing through the city on his way to Ted’s. Finally, he pulls up to Ted’s apartment.


INT. TED’S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

John throws open the door. The place is as lively as it can be. The party is packed with people, including Alix and Tanya, John’s co-workers from Liberty. There are also a large number of booze-swilling guys and hot chicks. Ted runs up, wearing a blazer.

TED

Johnny!	Thank Christ you made it!

JOHN
(quickly)
I got ten minutes, where’s Flash Gordon?
 



 
75

CONTINUED:

TED
Okay, get ready, man.
(to someone O.S.)
Hey, Sam! This is the guy I was tellin’ you about!

John turns to look in the direction Ted is indicating. The shot slows down into slo-mo as John’s eyes widen, and he sees...

OPPOSITE ANGLE - Across the room, SAM J. JONES turns in slo-mo to face John. He is inexplicably still sporting the same hairstyle he had in the “Flash Gordon” movie.

We hear the theme from “Flash Gordon.” We INTERCUT back and forth from him to John:

ON JOHN - He stands frozen in awe.

ON SAM - He smiles as he begins to walk toward the camera, in John’s POV.

ON JOHN - He continues to stare in frozen awe.

ON SAM - Still slowly walking toward camera in John’s POV, but he is now dressed in the Flash Gordon costume.

ON JOHN - He continues to stare in frozen awe.


EXT. MONGO SKY - DAY - FANTASY

Sam J. Jones flies on the flying Jetski from the movie. John stands behind him on the back, with his arms around Sam’s chest, as if on the back seat of a motorcycle. John has a huge, elated smile on his face.


INT. TED’S APARTMENT - BACK TO SCENE

ON John - He still stares in awe.

ON SAM - He smiles and offers an outstretched hand for a handshake.

BACK TO NORMAL SPEED - Sam walks up to John with Ted by his side.

TED

John, this is Sam Jones. Sam, this is my best friend in the whole world, John.

SAM

Hi there.	Good to meet you.
 



 
76

CONTINUED:

JOHN
(in absolute fucking awe)
I... thank you for saving every one of us.

SAM

You’re welcome. Hey, let’s do some shots, huh?

JOHN

With you?	Yes.	Oh my god, yes.

Sam passes out shots of Southern Comfort.

SAM
(raising his glass)
Death to Ming!

John and Ted look at each other, squealing with delight.

Everyone then does their shots.

SAM (CONT’D)
Hey, you guys seem pretty cool.
(significantly)
You like to party?

John and Ted don’t answer for a beat. They look at each other nervously. It’s clear neither one has any experience with this sort of thing.

SAM (CONT’D)

Aw, come on dudes. Don’t tell me you’ve never done it before.

JOHN
(a little scared)
Not... recently, no.

SAM

You fellas better come with me.


INT. TED’S APARTMENT - SHORTLY AFTER

John, Ted, and Sam emerge from the bathroom. John’s eyes are wide and enthusiastic. Ted has a little bit of powder on his nose, and his ears are flattened back. And Sam is just playing it cool.

TED

Wow.

SAM

Let’s party like the ‘80’s huh?
 


 
77

CONTINUED:

TED
(reverential)
Show us how, Flash.

SAM

It’s easy. We just gotta bang a lotta girls named Stephanie.

JOHN
Holy shit.
(looking around intensely)
All these people need to be talked to.


INT. TED’S APARTMENT - LATER

John and Ted sit staring at each other intensely across the table.

TED

Look Johnny, if we’re ever gonna get serious about openin’ a restaurant we gotta start plannin’ it now.

JOHN

Italian.

TED

Italian, yes.

JOHN

What’s the special on Tuesdays?

TED

Eggplant parm.

JOHN

Chopped salad half price.

TED

And it’s a non-restricted place.

JOHN

Yeah--wait, whaddaya mean?

TED

Anybody can come.

JOHN

Of course.

TED

Mormons are welcome.
 



 
78

CONTINUED:

JOHN

Well yeah--why wouldn’t they be?

TED

Exactly, that’s what I’m saying.

JOHN

But why even bring that up--

TED

You don’t bring it up. You just let ‘em in.

JOHN

Yeah, but why mention it?

TED

No one will.

JOHN

So why are we talking about it?

TED

You’re talkin’ about it, I’m just sayin’ let ‘em in.

JOHN

Yes, let ‘em in.

TED

Exactly.

JOHN

Right.

TED

Good.

JOHN

Okay.

TED

No Catholics, though.


INT. TED’S APARTMENT - SAME

Ted stands opposite a group of party guests who sit on the couch. He holds a knife.

TED

No see, I can do this.

GUY #1

Shut up.


 
79

CONTINUED:

TED

My teddy bear biology gives me superhuman reflexes.

GUY #2

Let him try it, man.

GUY #1

Fuck it, all right.

Guy #1 puts his hand down on the coffee table and Ted starts doing the knife trick from “Aliens”. He gets it right for a few seconds, then stabs the guy right through the hand. The guy screams in pain.

TED

Well, you never shoulda trusted me, I’m on drugs!


INT. TED’S APARTMENT - LATER

John stands with a pair of fake bear ears on his head, doing an impression of Ted as a small group of partygoers (Ted included) watches, laughing hysterically.

JOHN
(as Ted)
Hey Johnny, I just had a great idea-- let’s go get drunk and puke on cars from the overpass!

TED

Oh god, that was a fun day.

JOHN
(as Ted)
Johnny, you gotta get over here man, I just tried this DMT all the kids are talkin’ about, and I’m in trouble! I think I got sucked inside my chair!

TED
I do not sound that much like Peter
Griffin.


INT. TED’S APARTMENT - LATER

Ted sits on the couch drawing a pair of Garfield eyes on a topless girl. Below the eyes he has drawn the muzzle and the mouth, and above them the ears.
 





 
80

CONTINUED:

TED

See? There. Proof. Garfield’s eyes look like a pair of tits.

TAMI-LYNN

Okay, you were right.


INT. TED’S APARTMENT - LATER

Ted stands by the TV, singing a karaoke version of “I Only Want to be with You” by Hootie and the Blowfish.

TED

Okay, Johnny, c’mon up here and do this with me!

JOHN

No no.

TED

Come on!

JOHN

No, I don’t sing in front of people!

TED

YOU AND ME, WE COME FROM DIFFERENT WORLDS. YOU LIKE TO LAUGH AT ME WHEN I LOOK AT OTHER GIRLS. SOMETIMES YOU’RE CRAZY AND YOU WONDER WHY I’M SUCH A BABY ‘CAUSE DOLPHINS MAKE CRY. WELL THERE’S NOTHING I CAN DO I’VE BEEN LOOKING FOR A GIRL LIKE YOU. YOU LOOK AT ME YOU’VE GOT NOTHING LEFT TO SAY. I’LL ONLY POUT AT YOU UNTIL I GET MY WAY. I WON’T DANCE. YOU WON’T SING. I JUST WANT TO LOVE YOU BUT YOU WANT TO WEAR MY RING. WELL THERE’S NOTHING I CAN DO. I ONLY WANNA BE WITH YOU. YOU CAN CALL ME YOUR FOOL, I ONLY WANNA BE WITH YOU.


INT. TED’S BEDROOM - LATER

Sam, John and Ted stand by the wall.

TED

See there’s this one part of the wall that’s really soft, you could punch through it wicked easy.

Sam punches the wall a couple times, and his fist goes right through.
 


 
81

CONTINUED:

SAM/TED/JOHN

Holy shit! / Ha! / Wow! / Etc.

Immediately we see half an Asian face dart into frame through the hole. He screams in Cantonese, then,

ASIAN MAN

What the hell you problem!! You break my wall! You break my wall I break you wall!

The neighbor sticks a knife through the hole. John, Ted, and Sam scream. Sam and John jump around and scream as they frantically try to get the knife.

JOHN

AAA! AAA!! Break his arm, Flash! Cut his arm off!!

Sam grabs the arm, and it darts back inside.


INT. TED’S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

There’s an angry pounding on the door. One of the party guests opens it, and the Asian guy runs in, screaming in Cantonese. He holds a wooden spoon in one hand, and a live duck in the other. John, Sam, and Ted run back out into the living room. The Asian guy runs toward them, screaming first in Cantonese, then:

ASIAN MAN

You break my wall! This my home long time! You break my wall! You bastard men!

JOHN/TED

Dude, we’re sorry!	We’re sorry!

ASIAN MAN

You bastard men! I try to make duck dinner, now plaster everywhere!

TED

Chill out okay? We’ll pay for it! Let’s talk this out okay? What’s your name? I’m John!

ASIAN MAN
(cautiously)
My name Wan Ming.

FLASH
(narrowing eyes)
Ming!


 
82

CONTINUED:

SAM’S POV - We see the Asian man dressed as Ming the Merciless.

ASIAN MAN

You pay many dollar for wall! This bullshit! This all bullshit!

SAM

DEATH TO MING!!!

Sam charges the Asian man, tackling him. They both tumble over the back of the couch, nearly knocking it over. The duck flies out of his arms, landing on the floor. It immediately goes after Ted, who screams. ANGLE ON SAM, who chokes the Asian man on the floor. John struggles to pull him off.

JOHN

Sam, no!	Get off him!

ANGLE ON TED - who circles confrontationally with the duck, as in an Irish bar fight. ANGLE BACK ON THE GUYS FIGHTING - The Asian man jabs Sam in the eye with the other end of the spoon, and Sam goes staggering backward, falling into John. They land on the table, smashing it in half. They fall to the floor on top of each other.

ASIAN MAN

You crazy!	You crazy man!

The duck charges at Ted and slaps him across the face a few times with its wings.

TED

AAA!	AAAA!	OW!!

The Asian man calls to the duck from the door.

ASIAN MAN

Come on, James Franco!

The duck takes one last whack at Ted and waddles over to the Asian man, fluttering up into his arms.

ASIAN MAN (CONT’D)
(to John and Sam)
You pay for wall!

He exits, slamming the door.


INT. TED’S APARTMENT - LATER

John sits on the couch as Guy enters, holding hands with another man.


 
83

CONTINUED:

JOHN

Guy?

GUY

Hey. What’s goin’ on. This is Jared. He’s the guy who beat me up. We’re in love.

JOHN

What??

GUY

Yeah. Turns out I’m gay or whatever. Had no idea. C’mon Jared, let’s get a drink.

He and Jared walk off.

ANGLE ON JOHN, who sits on the couch, looking zoned out and drained. Sam Jones approaches.

SAM

How you doin’ there, ace? You comin’ down?

JOHN

Yeah.	Yeah, I don’t feel good.

SAM
Give it a couple hours, you’ll be golden,
Pony Boy.	Want a Xanax?

John looks at the clock. His eyes widen in panicked realization.

JOHN

Holy shit.	Holy shit, oh my god!

SAM

What?

JOHN

I gotta-- I gotta go!	Shit!

John scrambles to his feet, and runs for the front door.


INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

John opens the door and runs down the hall. He runs partway down the stairwell, and stops short as he sees Lori at the bottom, coming partway up the stairs. They stare at each other for a beat. She looks as hurt, angry, and betrayed as a woman can be.
 


 
84

CONTINUED:

JOHN

Lori... I...

He throws up all over the floor.


EXT. TED’S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

Lori storms out into the street. After a beat, John runs out after her.

JOHN

Lori!	Lori wait!

She hastily pays the cabbie who waits outside. John catches up to her and grabs her arm, but she shakes him off. She is clearly hurt, and on the verge of tears.

JOHN (CONT’D)

I’m sorry!	I messed up!	I--

LORI
I want you out of the apartment...
tonight.	Gimme my car keys.

JOHN

Can I please just explain--

LORI

No.

JOHN

I was gonna--

LORI

I have given up a big chunk of my life for you.

JOHN
I was gonna stop in for like five
minutes, and then Flash Gordon--

LORI

Just give me my keys, John!

He reluctantly hands her her keys. She turns and walks toward her car.

JOHN

Lori... please.	I love you.

She gets in the car and drives away with a screech.

Angle on Ted, who is walking out the door.
 



 
85

CONTINUED:

TED

Johnny, come on upstairs. Tami-Lynn’s gonna make some RC Cola from scratch.

JOHN

Fuck you! I don’t want to talk to you!

TED

What?

JOHN

Do you know what just happened? Do you have any clue? My life just ended.

TED

Oh come on, she’ll go home, watch Bridget Jones’ Somethin’ Asshole, cry a little bit, she’ll be fine, you’ll talk to her tomorrow.

JOHN
(exploding)
Are you even listening to me?! Do you give any shred of a shit?!

Ted pauses, realizing John is serious.

TED

Well... ‘course I do, Johnny. Thunder buddies for life.

JOHN

Jesus, Lori was right. I should have stopped hanging out with you a long time ago. I’m never gonna have a life with you around. I’m 35 years old and I’m going nowhere. All I do is smoke pot and watch movies with a teddy fucking bear. And because of that, I just lost the love of my life.

TED

Johnny, I’m... I’m sorry.

JOHN

I just... I gotta be on my own, Ted. I can’t see you anymore.

John turns and walks away.

TED

Johnny, wait!	Hey, listen!
 





 
86

CONTINUED:

Ted pushes his own stomach in. We hear his soundbox squeak out the words “I wuv you.” John does not turn around. Ted looks after him, then slowly lowers his head sadly. He sits down on the sidewalk, dazed and defeated.

DISSOLVE TO:


MONTAGE: SET TO MUSIC - SONG TBD


EXT. MIDTOWN HOTEL - NIGHT

John pulls up in his car, and sadly goes inside.


INT. MIDTOWN HOTEL - NIGHT

John sits on the bed and turns on the TV. He flips through the channels, seeing various clips of shows. Eventually, he shuts off the TV. He opens his wallet, and takes out a picture of Lori. He looks at it sadly.

DISSOLVE TO:


EXT. MINI GOLF COURSE - NIGHT

John and Lori play mini-golf. She putts, and the ball stops just short of the hole. John walks up to it, and “looks the other way” as he taps it in with his foot. She smiles warmly at him.

DISSOLVE TO:


EXT. BOSTON COMMON - SUNSET

John and Lori are on a swan boat ride, throwing bread to the ducks. They’re both leaning over the side with their hands on the rail. His hand moves partway on top of hers. They look at each other, and share a slow, romantic kiss.

DISSOLVE TO:


INT. JOHN AND LORI’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Lori sits on the couch, wrapped in a blanket, her face wet with tears. ANGLE ON the TV screen, where a Bridget Jones film is playing. ANGLE BACK ON Lori, who is looking at the screen, but is really looking inward...

DISSOLVE TO:
 
87


EXT. BEACH - DUSK

ANGLE ON a partially full moon. PAN DOWN to John and Lori, walking along the beach, holding hands. He kisses her on the cheek, then looks down, noticing something O.S. He leans down and picks up a dead horseshoe crab. He dangles it in Lori’s face. She freaks out, and runs into the water. They both laugh.

DISSOLVE TO:


INT. JOHN AND LORI’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

ANGLE ON A BIRTHDAY CARD ON THE TABLE - We pull out to reveal Lori sitting at the table, with a couple of candles in front of her. John comes out of the kitchen wearing an apron, and holding an entire turkey with a candle in it. She smiles and puts her hands over her mouth with delighted hilarity. He sets the turkey down, and she gives him a big, laughing smile as she shakes her head.

INT. TED’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

SLOW PAN ACROSS TED’S APARTMENT - The party is now over. Everyone has gone, and the place is a mess. ANGLE INTO TED’S BEDROOM - He lies alone in his bed, flipping through channels with his remote. He turns and stares at a picture in a frame next to his bed. ANGLE ON THE PICTURE It shows John and Ted as kids, standing in the snow, smiling at the camera. They stand next to a soapbox car that they have built and painted.

EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY

8-year-old John and Ted are at the top of a hill with the soapbox racer. Ted is in the racer, wearing a helmet. John gives the racer a push, and Ted speeds off down the hill. At the bottom, he smashes into a tree, shattering the racer, and sending him flying out of it onto the ground. A dog runs into frame, snatches Ted up, and runs off with him. John sprints after the dog.

INT. CHUCK E. CHEESE - SAME

John and Ted share a pizza. Ted has sauce all over his mouth and fur. John hands him a napkin and he wipes it off. Ted looks O.S., then excitedly gives John a “hang on, check this out” gesture. He runs O.S. ANGLE ON the stage, where the animal band play their instruments. Ted is there among them, stiffly playing the banjo and looking very animatronic. A couple little kids walk up to watch. After a beat, Ted gets in their faces, scaring the shit out of them. They run away, crying and traumatized. ANGLE ON John, who laughs hysterically.

INT. JOHN AND LORI’S APARTMENT - DAY

John and Lori paint the walls of their then new apartment. They start to playfully splatter paint on each other. ANGLE ON Ted, who watches from the other side of the room, where he leans against the wall. He shakes his head in a “whatever” fashion, and walks toward the door. When he turns, we see there is a white stripe of paint going down his back.


EXT. JOHN AND LORI’S APARTMENT - LATER

Ted exits the apartment, holding a pack of cigarettes and a lighter. He pulls one cigarette out with his mouth and goes to light it.

He then notices something out of the corner of his eye. He reacts with a take, and sprints O.S., dropping the cigarette and the lighter. After a beat, a skunk shuffles through frame after him.

INT./ ESTAB. LORI’S OFFICE - DAY


INT. REX’S OFFICE - SAME

Rex sits at his desk and stares out the window.

REX

So, word through the grapevine is you are newly solo. I have tickets to see Norah Jones at the Hatch Shell tonight, and I would love it if you’d go with me.

LORI

You’re asking me out the day after I broke up with someone.

REX

Look, I’m gonna cut the shit here.

LORI

Okay.

REX

This is the first time you’ve been single in all the years you’ve worked here. Just go out with me one time. And if you’re miserable and you hate it, I promise I will never even hint at the subject again. Please.

LORI

Rex, I don’t think it’s smart.

REX

Look, I’m an asshole. I know that. It worked for me in high school, and it’s been like a reflex ever since.

REX (CONT'D)

(sigh) Lori, the worst that can happen is you have a fun, casual date with a guy who only wants a chance to prove to you that he can be something more than a jerk. Besides, you’re a huge catch and it’s about time somebody treated you that way.

LORI

Fine... I guess it beats crying myself to sleep every night.

REX

Great.	Pick you up at seven?


EXT./ ESTAB. MIDTOWN HOTEL - NIGHT

It’s raining outside.


INT. MIDTOWN HOTEL - SAME

John sulks on the bed, leafing through a Tintin comic book. There’s a knock at the door.

JOHN

Who is it?

TED

Johnny, it’s me.

JOHN

Go away.

TED

Johnny, open the door, please. I wanna talk.

John ignores him. A few beats go by, then the window slides open from the outside, and Ted tumbles in, landing on the floor, soaked.

JOHN

Jesus--

Ted shakes the water off himself like a dog. John flinches back, trying not to get wet.

JOHN (CONT’D)

Jesus Christ!

CONTINUED:

TED

Sorry. Look, Johnny, I know you’re pissed, but just listen to me for five seconds. I saw Lori out on a date with Rex.

JOHN

What?

TED

I’m serious, John, I went over to your house to talk to Lori to try and take some of the heat off you, and I saw Rex picking her up. They were going to the Hatch Shell.

JOHN

You’re un-fucking-believable, you know that? How stupid do you think I am? First of all, Lori would never go out with Rex, and second of all, if you think that by making shit like that up you’re gonna make me choose some kind of loyalty to you over her--

TED

Johnny, it’s the truth.	I’m tellin’ ya--

JOHN

Get outta here.

TED
(beat)
You know, you’re actin’ like a cock, you know that?

JOHN

What?	I’m acting like a cock?

TED

Yes. You are actin’ like a giant, V-shaped-funny-lookin’-guy-in-a-porno cock.

JOHN

Huh?

TED

‘Member that porno we saw with the guy with the V-shaped cock--forget it. What I’m sayin’ is that you’re blamin’ me for somethin’ you did to yourself.

John glares at him.

TED (CONT’D)

Lori was right about you. You can’t take responsibility for anything that goes on in your life.

JOHN

Oh, and you can?

TED

I don’t have to, I’m a fuckin’ teddy bear! Y’know somethin’, I didn’t tie you up and drag you to that party. I wanted you to come because you’re supposedly my best friend.

JOHN

Oh, yeah? Is that why you’ve manipulated me for years to stay eternally eight years old at the expense of the rest of my life?

TED

Whoa whoa, it’s not my fault you didn’t care enough about your relationship.

JOHN

You can’t stand there and tell me you haven’t always seen Lori as a threat to our friendship! It works out so much better for you when you and I are getting fucked up on the couch at 9 am, doesn’t it?

TED

Wow. Listen to yourself. What am I, Emperor Ming here, controllin’ your mind? That’s your choice, John! And you know, by blamin’ me, you just make yourself look like a pussy.

JOHN
(beat)
You know... sometimes I think back to that Christmas morning when I was eight years old... and I wish I’d just gotten a Teddy Ruxpin.

TED
(beat)
Say that one more time.

JOHN

Teddy... Rux-fucking-pin.
