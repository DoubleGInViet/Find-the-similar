CONTINUED:

Ted stares at him for a beat, then lunges at him, wrapping his whole body around John’s face and head, like the facehuggers from “Aliens.” John stumbles around the room, trying to pry Ted off. Eventually, he stumbles into the bathroom, and crashes through the shower door, shattering it. He and Ted exchange punches to the face. John lands a particularly hard one, which sends Ted flying across the room, and slamming into the wall. Ted hits the floor, and runs out of the bathroom. John stumbles to his feet. Ted scrambles across the bed, reaches into the bedside drawer, and pulls out a Bible. John staggers out of the bathroom, just in time to be pelted in the head as Ted throws the Bible at him.

JOHN (CONT’D)
AAAAAA!!!	Fucking Jesus fucking Christ!
god fucking dammit!!!

Ted throws other objects at him, including beer cans and the phone. John and Ted stare at each other for a beat, each one breathing heavily (Ted is now on the floor).

John charges at Ted, sailing across the bed, and tackling him, knocking over the side table and lamp in the process. John and Ted scuffle on the floor, engaging in a realistic-as-possible fistfight. Each one gets a number of blows in. John throws Ted off him, and back onto the bed. Ted taunts him.

TED

C’mon, motherfucker!

John jumps at Ted, throwing a jab at him. But Ted dodges, and John’s fist goes into the wall above the headboard. He struggles to pull free as he flails about with his other hand, grabbing at Ted. Ted dodges again, and scrambles up John’s head, jumping up and grabbing the chain on the ceiling fan, turning it on, and causing Ted to swing back and forth. John pulls free, and stumbles backward off the bed. He notices a tall, free-standing lamp in the corner. He pulls the plug out of the wall, and uses the lamp to take a swing at Ted. Ted swings out of the way. John takes a second swing, but the lamp cord catches on the fan’s motor. The lamp is ripped from John’s grasp, it swings around through the air, and cracks him in the side of the head. John goes down, whacking his head a second time on the baseboard of the bed. He howls in pain as he lies on his stomach, clutching his head. Ted takes advantage of this. He jumps down from the cord, and pulls the antenna off the clock radio next to the bed. He jumps down to the floor, yanks John’s pants partway down, and starts whipping his bare ass with the antenna. John yells in fury, and kicks blindly at Ted. He turns over, kicking ted in the face, and kicking the cabinet that the TV is on.
 


 
94

CONTINUED:

The TV wobbles, and falls off the cabinet, landing with a crash, right on his groin. John lies there, with the TV on his crotch and his pants down, and breathes heavily.

Ted, still dazed from the kick to the face, crawls over to him. Both breathe heavily. John’s breathing deteriorates into sobs.

TED (CONT’D)
(breathing heavily)
Why...why are you crying?

JOHN

My dick is in the TV.

John continues to sob. Ted climbs down off the table and up onto the bed. He pushes the TV off John, then lies down next to him. Ted starts to sob himself.

TED

I’m so sorry, Johnny.	I’m so sorry.

JOHN

So am I, man.

TED

I love you.

JOHN

I love you, too.

John hugs Ted, who hugs him back.

TED

Listen... you gotta let me help you make things right with you and Lori.

JOHN

There is no putting things right. She hates me.

TED

No, John, we can get her back. Look, remember when you were ten, and you hit that squirrel with your BB gun, and then when we saw it fall from the tree we both starting crying? Remember? And then we ran up to it and tried to give it CPR? And it came back to life? John, we could do that again.

JOHN

Ted, we crushed its rib cage and blew out its lungs trying to give it CPR. It died.

CONTINUED:

TED
(long beat)
We can get Lori back.


EXT. HATCH SHELL - NIGHT

A huge crowd has gathered for the Norah Jones concert. They cheer as she sings “Come Away With Me,” backed by a large string section. ANGLE ON Rex and Lori, who cheer in the audience along with everyone else. They seem to be having a fantastic time.

REX
God, she’s so brave.	YOUR MUSIC IS SO
FUCKING BRAVE!!

Norah finishes the song.

NORAH

Thanks so much! We’re gonna take a short break, but we’ll be back in a few!

The crowd cheers.


INT. BACKSTAGE - SHORTLY AFTER

ANGLE ON a dressing room sign which reads NORAH JONES. We move inside the dressing room as Norah enters and pours a drink.

TED (O.S.)

Hey, play chopsticks, you jazzy slut!

NORAH
(turning, recognizing)
Teddy!! How you doin’, you fuzzy little asshole?

She hugs him.

TED

Well, I’m not a hot half-Muslim chick who sold 37 million records, but I’m hangin’ in there.

NORAH

Well, half-Indian, but thanks.

TED

Eh, ooga booga, whatever. Hey, I want you to meet a good pal of mine. Hey Johnny, come on in!
 


 
96

CONTINUED:

ANGLE ON the doorway, where John enters, a little nervous.

TED (CONT’D)

Norah, this is my friend John.

JOHN
(self-consciously extends
hand)
Hi.	Hi, Norah Jones.

NORAH
(shaking his hand)
Ha. Whoa, relax there, sweaty. You ready to bring down the house?

JOHN
Yes ma’am.	Thank you for the
opportunity, Ms.-- Ma’am Jones.

TED

Jesus, you look fantastic.

NORAH

Well, you’re probably not used to seeing me fully clothed.

TED

Me and Norah met in 2002 at a party at Belinda Carlisle’s house and we had awkward, fuzzy sex in the coatroom.

NORAH

Actually, you weren’t so bad for a guy with no penis.

TED

I have written so many letters to Hasbro about that.


EXT. HATCH SHELL - SHORTLY AFTER

The crowd is cheering. Norah is back out on stage at the piano.

NORAH

Okay, I’m gonna give my chops a rest here and invite a friend of mine up to the stage. He’s gonna sing a song to a very special lady in the audience who he loves very much. Let’s give a big hand to John Bennett!
 



 
97

CONTINUED:

The crowd applauds dutifully as John walks out onstage.

ANGLE ON Lori and Rex.	Lori reacts, shocked.

LORI

Oh my god.

John takes center stage, and looks down at Lori.

JOHN

Uh, hi. Um... This is for Lori Collins. Because I love her. This song always reminds me of the most important night of my life. The night we met. It’s the theme song from the movie “Octopussy.”

The band begins playing. “All Time High”. Inexplicably, Norah is playing the saxophone with a pair of shades on.

JOHN (CONT’D)
ALL I WANTED WAS A SWEET DISTRACTION FOR
AN HOUR OR TWO / HAD NO INTENTION TO DO
THE THINGS WE’VE DONE / FUNNY HOW IT
ALWAYS GOES WITH LOVE, WHEN YOU DON’T
LOOK, YOU FIND / BUT THEN WE’RE TWO OF A
KIND / WE MOVE AS ONE

ANGLE ON Lori and Rex. Rex is visibly derisive, but we see that Lori is softening. It’s working...

JOHN (CONT’D)
WE’RE AN ALL-TIME HIGH / WE’LL CHANGE ALL
THAT’S GONE BEFORE / DOING SO MUCH MORE /
THAN FALLING IN LOVE

REX
(fake voice, covering his
mouth and looking away)
You suck, get off the stage!
(then, for Lori’s benefit)
Hey, come on guys!

The crowd starts to take the cue.

CROWD
Get off the stage! / Boooo! / You suck! /
We wanna hear Norah! / Come on!

ANGLE ON Ted in the wings.

TED

Ah, god.

JOHN
SO HOLD ON TIGHT / LET THE FLIGHT
BEGIN...


 
98

CONTINUED:

ANGLE ON a crazed audience member, who rushes the stage, racing toward John.

CRAZY GUY

You’re an asshole!

John flinches as he raises the mic stand off the floor at the last second, so the base is sticking out horizontally. The crazy guy runs right into it, bashing himself in the face. He goes down, unconscious and bleeding. Everyone gasps as the music stops.

NORAH

Jesus.

A few concert personnel rush out to check the guy.

STAGEHAND

Someone call an ambulance!

The crowd is now shouting angrily at John. But he is only focused n one spot in the crowd. He sees that Lori and Rex are gone. Almost oblivious to the rest of the frenzy, he sighs, heartbroken. A couple of concert security personnel haul him offstage.


EXT. HATCH SHELL PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Rex escorts Lori to his car.

REX

That was insane. Did you see the way that guy’s body hit the ground? It was like a rag doll!

LORI

Yeah, I’d rather just not talk about it.

REX

You want to go get a drink after this? I feel like I could use one after seeing a guy almost die.

LORI

Nope, I think I’d rather you just take me home.

REX

One drink, come on.

LORI

Nope, not really feeling up to it.
 



 
99

CONTINUED:

REX

Alright, alright, I get it. I don’t blame you. When you think about it, it was actually really unfair of him to embarrass you like that.

LORI

Just to be clear, I am not embarrassed. Listen, John and I may have our problems but at least he tried. You know what? I don’t feel like talking to you about this.

She walks away.

REX

Where you going?

LORI

Taking a cab.	I’m going home.

As she disappears out of earshot, Rex closes his eyes and releases a fart.

REX

Finally.


EXT./ ESTAB. JOHN & LORI’S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY


INT. JOHN AND LORI’S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - SAME

Lori gets out of the shower, and begins towelling off, still reeling with disgust from her encounter with Rex. After a few moments, there’s a knock at the door. Lori sighs with annoyance, and walks to the door, still in her towel. She looks through the peephole, but there’s no one there. She opens the door cautiously, and looks out into the hall. There’s no one there.

TED (O.S.)

Down here, I swear to god I’m not lookin’ up your towel.

She looks down with a start, and sees Ted standing there.

He’s blocking his view with one hand.

TED (CONT’D)

Not lookin’ up your towel. Not lookin’ at your funny business.
 






 
100

CONTINUED:

LORI

(pulling towel closer to her) Ted? What’re you doing here? What do you want?

TED

I need to talk to you.

LORI

Look, if you’re here to fight John’s battle for hi--

TED

Lori, do me a favor and let me talk first, and then you can say whatever you want.

There’s a beat.	She reluctantly considers.


INT. JOHN AND LORI’S LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

Lori, now in a robe, sits down on the couch, facing Ted.

TED
Look, John loves you very much.	More
than anything in the world.	And he’s
fallin’ to fuckin’ pieces without you. He knows he screwed up big time, but you gotta believe me that is wasn’t all his fault. If you’ll just give him one more chance to be with you--

She rolls her eyes.

TED (CONT’D)

Listen to me! If you’ll just give him one more chance... I promise I will leave and never come back. He’ll be all yours. Just give him one more chance.

LORI

Ted... that’s a very nice offer, but I don’t want you to do that. This is about John and me and our problems. And I don’t think it can be fixed.

TED

Because of me! Look, you want him to be a man. And I’m the one who’s keepin’ that from happening. As long as he’s got his teddy bear, he’s still a boy. And I care about him as much as you do. But I’m willing to give up the boy so you can have the man.


 
101

CONTINUED:

We can see Lori starting to soften a bit.

TED (CONT’D)

Look, I’m givin’ this the best shot I got here, Lori. I’m beggin’ you. I’m no good at this emotional crap, but I gotta help my best friend. Please. Just talk to him.

LORI
(sigh)
I’ll talk to him.

TED

Thank you. He’s waitin’ for me down at Charley’s. So... maybe you could, y’know... go down instead of me?

LORI

What... now?

TED

Please. You’ll regret it for the rest of your life if you don’t.

LORI

Alright, alright, I’ll go.


INT. JOHN AND LORI’S APARTMENT - SHORTLY AFTER

Lori emerges from the bedroom, dressed, and heads for the door. Ted is on the couch watching TV.

TED
(flipping on TV)
Hey, you mind if I stay and watch the Sox?

The door shuts and she’s gone. Ted gets up and walks into the kitchen. He opens the fridge.

TED (CONT’D)

Jesus Christ, what a chick fridge. Yoplait, a cantaloupe, and a Brita water filter.

He opens up a crisper drawer, and looks at a six-pack of beer bottles.

TED (CONT’D)
Michelob Ultra Tuscan Orange Grapefruit.
My god, America is imploding.
 



 
102

CONTINUED:

He shakes his head as he opens the beer, and walks into the other room. He settles down in a recliner, and watches the game. After a moment, there’s a knock at the door. Ted sighs with annoyance, and gets up.

TED (CONT’D)

Forget your keys?

He walks to the door, and opens it up.

TED (CONT’D)

You know, your beer suck--

He freezes, and looks up. We reveal Donny, the creepy man from earlier, with his son Robert.

DONNY

Hi, Ted.

TED

Fuck.

Donny throws a sack over Ted, trapping him.


EXT./ ESTAB. CHARLEY’S - LATER DAY

Lori’s car pulls up, and she gets out.


INT. CHARLEY’S - CONTINUOUS

Lori enters, and looks around. She spots John, who looks up from a menu. He is surprised to see her. She sighs and walks over to him.

JOHN

Lori!	What-- what are you doing here?

LORI

You can thank Ted.

A beat.	John smiles slightly.

LORI (CONT’D)

How are you?

JOHN

Good, good. I’ve, uh... made myself a nice little home at the Midtown Hotel up the street. I’d show you around, but it’s kinda classy. They require an undershirt and at least one visible cold sore for all customers.
 


 
103

CONTINUED:

LORI
(laughs humorlessly)
Well.	Shall I sit?

JOHN

Uh, yeah.

She does. There’s a beat. A busboy brings them each a water.

JOHN (CONT’D)

So, work’s good?	Everything good there?

LORI

Yeah.	Work’s fine.

JOHN

How’s Rex?

LORI

There is no Rex.

JOHN
Oh.	Good.
(beat)

Well... I guess we can’t make small talk all day, so I’ll say what I wanna say. I could sit here and tell you I’m sorry, it was a huge misunderstanding, and I’m ready to change. But I don’t think you wanna hear any of that crap. I’m not gonna try and get you to take me back. Why would you? I’ve been a really shitty boyfriend for the last four years. I don’t deserve you. I didn’t take our relationship seriously, even though I love you more than life itself. All I want is... just to end on good terms. Because I owe that to you. I want you to be happy... and for us to be friends.

LORI
(a little taken aback)
Wow.	Thank you.	I appreciate that.

JOHN

Well.	That’s pretty much it.

He takes out some money, and puts it on the table, paying the check. He smiles at her and walks out. She sits there for a beat.
 
104


EXT. DONNY’S HOUSE - LATE DAY

Donny’s car pulls up. The house is a low-class, creepily shabby-looking Boston home (think Buffalo Bill in “Silence of the Lambs”). It’s close to one end of the base of a bridge.


INT. DONNY’S HOUSE - LATE DAY

Donny carries the sack inside, and unceremoniously dumps Ted onto the floor. Ted looks around. It’s just as shitty on the inside as on the outside. On the walls, there are a disturbing number of newspaper clippings, photo spreads, etc. Most are from press from Ted’s media heyday, but some are photographs of Ted and John out in public that Donny clearly took himself.

TED

Whoa...

DONNY

Yes, as you can see, you’ve been part of our family for quite some time. Welcome home.

TED

Heh, you know what’s hilarious, I got tons of pictures of you guys at my house.

ROBERT

Daddy, is he all mine?

DONNY
He’s all yours, my little winner.
You’ve arrived at a lucky time, Ted.
It’s almost Robert’s play hour.

TED

I’m guessin’ you guys don’t have a PS3. I’m guessin’ you’re more of a wooden horse with a wig kinda family.


INT. ROBERT’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Ted is led into Robert’s room. It’s a fairly sparse room with some toys strewn about. A wooden rocking horse with a wig stands in the corner.

TED

Huh.	Wig horse.

Robert sits down on the floor, smiling at him. Donny stands in the doorway.


 
105

CONTINUED:

DONNY

Now, remember, Ted, you belong to Robert now. So you will do as he says.

TED

Y’know, you think you’re just gonna get away with a kidnapping? Nice fuckin’ example you’re settin’ for your kid.

DONNY
(leaning in to Ted with
anger)
LANGUAGE!!!

Ted flinches nervously.	Donny moves back.

DONNY (CONT’D)

When I was a little boy, I saw you on television. And I thought you were the most amazing, most wonderful thing I’d ever seen. Ever. And I asked my father if I could have a magical teddy bear, too. And he said no. And I was heartbroken. I decided that if I ever had a son, I would never say no to him.

TED

Maybe “no” to a Snickers bar every once in awhile wouldn’t hurt.

ROBERT

Me and Ted are gonna be best friends, daddy.

DONNY

Yes.	You are.	Happy play time.

Donny shuts the door.	Robert stares at Ted.

TED

Jesus fucking Christ!

ROBERT

No!	Daddy said no bad words!

TED

Yeah well, fuck your dad.

Ted scrambles for the window and tries to open it. It doesn’t budge. He takes a running leap at it, but just bounces off like a plush toy, and lands on the floor.

TED (CONT’D)

Shit!
 


 
106

CONTINUED:

Robert stands over him.

ROBERT

I said a bad word one time, and daddy punished me for it.

TED

That’s a great story, I felt like I was there.

ROBERT

Daddy gave me an ouch. Now I have to give you an ouch.

Robert grabs Ted with one hand, and gets a grip on one of Ted’s ears with the other hand. Robert pulls on the ear as hard as he can, and rips the ear off. Ted screams as loud as he can. Robert looks at him, holding the ear.

TED

Okay... okay, kid. You win. We’ll do it your way. You wanna play a game or somethin’? It’s play time, let’s play a game.

ROBERT

Yeah, I wanna play a game!

TED

Good, good, hey, how ‘bout we play a little game of hide and seek?

ROBERT

I love hide and seek!	I’ll hide!

TED

Well, now, Robert, your dad likes you to show good manners, right?

ROBERT

Yes.

TED

Well, a well-mannered kid lets his guest hide first, don’t ya think?

There’s a beat.	Robert stares blankly at him, then:

ROBERT

Okay, you hide first.

TED

Great. Fantastic. Okay, now you count to a hundred and then try to find me, okay?


 
107

CONTINUED:

ROBERT

Do I need to wash my hands before this game?

TED

You... well-- no, you-- god, that’s a weird fuckin’ question, no, just start countin’.

Robert sits down, covers his eyes and starts counting.

ROBERT

One... two... three...

Ted grabs a chair and starts sliding it over toward the door.

TED

Okay, no peekin’, now, or you’ll get kid cancer.

Ted reaches the door, climbs up onto the chair, and turns the doorknob. He opens the door, and exits out into the hallway. After a beat, he re-enters, grabs his severed ear, and exits again.


INT. HALLWAY - LATE DAY

Ted nervously moves down the hallway toward the front door. He has it in sight on the far end of the living room, but when he gets closer to the living room doorway, he sees that Donny is sitting in an armchair, watching The Incredible Hulk (the old TV show). Ted darts back into the hallway before he’s seen, but in the process, bumps into a small table with a lamp and a couple knick knacks on it. One of them, a small ceramic penguin, falls over, making a sound. Donny turns and looks in the direction of the hallway.

DONNY
(beat)
Robert?	How’s play time?


INT. ROBERT’S ROOM - LATE DAY

Robert’s hands still cover his eyes.

ROBERT

Good, daddy!
 
108


INT. LIVING ROOM - LATE DAY

DONNY

Ted, are you making friends with Robert?

Ted looks panicky, not knowing what to do. After a beat, Donny leans forward as if he’s about to get up.

DONNY (CONT’D)

Ted?

ROBERT (O.S.)

Daddy, you’re gonna ruin the game!

DONNY
(chuckling)
Okay.

Ted breathes a sigh of relief, and walks the other way down the hall. He passes a door. He opens it, but it’s just a storage closet. He’s about to shut it, but notices a stapler amidst the odds and ends. He hastily begins stapling his ear back on.


INT. DONNY’S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Donny’s hears something, and turns to look. We think he’s about to get up, but he then settles back in.

ANGLE BACK ON TED, who puts on last staple in. Satisfied, he exits the closet and continues down the hall.


INT. DONNY’S KITCHEN - LATE DAY

Ted looks around, and spots a phone on the counter. He jumps up, grabs the handset, and jumps back down. He dials John’s number.


EXT. BOSTON STREET - CONTINUOUS

John is walking back to the Midtown Hotel. After a beat, Lori’s car pulls up slowly alongside him. She leans over.

LORI

Hey.

JOHN

Hey.
 



 
109

CONTINUED:

LORI
Kinda late to be walkin’ home by
yourself.

JOHN

Oh, I’ll be okay. If I get raped, it’ll be my fault with what I’m wearing.

LORI

Listen, John... there’s something I wanna say to you, too.

He pauses, then gets into the car and sits down next to her. She prepares to speak, but John’s phone rings. He shuts it off without looking at it.

JOHN

Go ahead.


INT. DONNY’S KITCHEN - LATE DAY/DUSK

Ted nervously holds the phone to his ear.


INT. LORI’S CAR - LATE DAY/DUSK

LORI

John, I just want you to know that... I mean, I hope you don’t think that--

John’s phone rings. He looks down at it, annoyed. It reads “Unknown caller.” He silences it.

LORI (CONT’D)
I, um... I just feel like we should...
keep talking.	Because--

John’s phone rings again.	Exasperated, he answers it.

JOHN

Whoever this is, it’s not a good time.

INTERCUT BACK & FORTH BETWEEN TED AND JOHN:

TED

John!	It’s me!	Can you hear me?

JOHN

Ted?

Lori sighs, slightly annoyed.

JOHN (CONT’D)

Listen, I gotta call you back.


 
110

CONTINUED:

TED

No, John!	Don’t hang up, I’m in trouble!

JOHN

What do you mean, what kinda trouble?

Lori turns, slightly curious, but still annoyed.

TED

They got me! That freaky guy and his freaky fat kid!

JOHN

What?

TED

I’m in their house, John! You gotta call the police, they won’t let me outta here! They tore my ear off!

JOHN

Wait, slow down!	Where are you?

TED

Uh... I’m not sure, it’s uh--

Suddenly, a hand grabs the phone away from Ted. He gasps and looks up. It’s Donny, who slams the phone back down in its cradle.

DONNY
(dark, brewing rage)
You’re not a very polite guest.

TED

Shit.


INT. LORI’S CAR - LATE DAY/DUSK

JOHN
(into phone)
Ted?	Ted?	Hello?	Ted!

LORI

What’s the matter, is he all right?

JOHN

I don’t know.

LORI

Where is he?

JOHN

I don’t know, but he’s in trouble.


 
111

CONTINUED:

LORI

Why? What happened? Can you call him back?

JOHN

No, it’s blocked-- wait a second.

John scrambles for his wallet. He opens it, and pulls out the address given to him earlier by Donny at the Common. He looks at it, then points out the window.

JOHN (CONT’D)

Go! Take Columbus to Herald and get on the expressway!


EXT. BOSTON STREET - CONTINUOUS

Lori’s car peels out and races off.


INT. DONNY’S KITCHEN - LATE DAY

Donny stands over Ted.

DONNY

You’ve put us in a pickle here, haven’t you? We have to go now.

TED

Yeah, good idea.

Ted runs through Donny’s legs, and out into the hall. He races for the living room and the exit, but Robert steps in front of the door, blocking him.

TED (CONT’D)

Aaaa!

ROBERT

Found you.

Robert turns the deadbolt on the door, locking it. Ted turns and bolts in the other direction back down the hallway, but sees Donny heading for him. Ted ducks into the dining room, as Donny lunges for him and misses.


INT. DINING ROOM - LATE DAY - CONTINUOUS

Donny pursues Ted around the table. Ted ducks under the table, under the chairs, etc. trying to escape Donny (and Robert, who has entered the room). Ted slips past them and back out into the hall.
 


 
112

CONTINUED:

He races for the door, but the deadbolt is too high to reach. He runs into the living room, and pushes open a door.


INT. BASEMENT - LATE DAY - CONTINUOUS

Ted tumbles down the dark stairs into the basement, which is lit only by a single bulb hanging from the ceiling. He lands, gets his bearings, then freezes in shock, as he sees that the basement is loaded with ripped and mutilated teddy bears.

TED

AAAAAA!

Donny and Robert move in to frame behind him.

DONNY

We tried to make do with other teddy bears. But none of them were you, Ted.

Ted whirls around in shock, as we cut to:


EXT. STREET - DUSK

John and Lori race through the streets of Boston.


INT. LORI’S CAR - DUSK

JOHN

It’s this creepy fucked-up guy who wants Ted for his creepy fucked-up son. They got him somehow.

LORI

Which way?

JOHN

Shoot up 99!


EXT. BOSTON STREET - DUSK - CONTINUOUS

The car makes a hard left.


INT. LORI’S CAR - DUSK - CONTINUOUS

John finishes punching numbers into his cellphone.

Hello, 911? I need the police right away! This guy took my teddy bear!
(beat)
...Hello?


EXT. BOSTON STREET - DUSK - CONTINUOUS

Lori’s car speeds away.


EXT. DONNY’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Donny and Robert emerge from the house. Donny clutches the sack. We can see it move as Ted struggles to get free. Robert gets in the back seat of the car as Donny opens the way back door, and dumps Ted inside.


INT. DONNY’S CAR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Ted tumbles out of the sack and into the way back. Donny slams the door. He gets into the car.

DONNY

Robert, seat belt.

Robert buckles up.

EXT. DONNY’S HOUSE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Donny pulls away down the alley.

INT. DONNY’S CAR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Ted scrambles to his feet.


INT. LORI’S CAR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

John looks around frantically, then spots something out of the passenger’s side window.

JOHN’S POV - They pass the alley, where we see Donny’s car heading out of the alleyway.

JOHN
(to Lori)
Whoa whoa, stop stop stop!

The car slows down, and John sees Donny’s car make the turn out onto the street. Ted is looking out the back.
 
114


INT. DONNY’S CAR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

TED

Johnny!

Robert and Donny both hear this. Donny looks in his side-view mirror, just in time to see Lori’s car swing a U-turn to pursue them. Donny speeds up, and races off up the street. Lori’s car speeds up in pursuit.


EXT. STREETS OF BOSTON - NIGHT

We do several quick cuts as the chase blasts its way through the Boston streets, avoiding traffic and pedestrians.


INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Donny’s car races through the tunnel. Lori’s car pursues.


INT. DONNY’S CAR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Ted continues to stare out the back. He then notices a crowbar on the floor in the way back. He grabs it, and takes a hard swing at the rear window. It does not break. Robert sees this, and scrambles to undo his seat belt.


INT. LORI’S CAR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

JOHN

Come on, we’re losing him!

Lori speeds up.


INT. DONNY’S CAR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Ted takes another swing at the window. The glass does not break. Robert undoes his seat belt, and scrambles back. He grabs Ted, who drops the crowbar. He starts to pull Ted back over into the back seat, but Ted manages to wriggle free.


INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

The chase continues.
 
115


INT. DONNY’S CAR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Ted grabs the crowbar, and again takes a swing at the window. This time, it shatters. He drops the crowbar, and climbs up onto the edge of the window.


INT. LORI’S CAR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

They see Ted in the window.

JOHN

Get closer!

LORI

I’m trying!


INT. DONNY’S CAR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Ted gets one leg and one arm up onto the edge of the window, when suddenly he is whacked hard in the side of the head, sending him tumbling onto the floor. We see that Robert has struck him hard with the crowbar.

TED
(holding head in pain)
Aaaaa!	Shit!!


INT. LORI’S CAR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

They continue watch with held breath, as they keep up.


INT. DONNY’S CAR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Ted shakes himself off, still a little dazed, and climbs back up. Robert climbs into the way back and grabs one of his legs.

ROBERT

No!	You’re being bad!

Ted reaches down and grabs the crowbar with one arm, and brandishes it threateningly at Robert.

TED

Back off, Susan Boyle.

Robert backs off in fear. Ted climbs out onto the rear of the car, and positions himself to make the jump. He tosses the crowbar away into the tunnel. John and Lori speed up, getting closer to him, so he can make the jump.
 
116


INT. LORI’S CAR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

JOHN

Easy...

LORI

I know.

JOHN

Easy--

LORI

I know!


INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Lori’s car moves closer to Donny’s. There’s a tense moment with some back and forth cutting... and then Ted makes the jump! He lands on the hood of Lori’s car, and slides across, grabbing the windshield wiper to avoid falling off. He pulls himself back up. John and Lori breathe energetic sighs of relief.

TED

Johnny!	Total T.J. Hooker, right?

John and Lori laugh.

JOHN

Yes!	Fuckin’ A right!


INT. DONNY’S CAR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Donny sees what’s happening in his side mirror. He puts his foot on the brakes, and the car screeches as it drastically reduces speed. John’s car slams into Donny’s causing Ted to go flying back through open rear window of Donny’s car, past Robert (who is still in the way back) and tumbling into the back seat.

TED

God dammit!

Ted gets his bearings, and notices the sack that Donny captured him in, lying on the floor. He looks up at Donny for a beat, then grabs the sack.

ANGLE ON Donny driving. Suddenly, Ted jumps up from behind, and throws the sack over Donny’s head, bracing himself against the back of the front seat. Donny yells in anger, and pulls at Ted, trying to get him off.
 
117


INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Donny’s car scrapes against the side of the tunnel, sending sparks flying.


INT. DONNY’S CAR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Donny grabs Ted and flings him off his face, onto the floor on the passengers’ side. Donny rips the sack off his head, and reacts as he looks out the front window. He’s approaching the end of the tunnel, and there is opposing traffic moving in the other direction.


EXT. BOSTON CITY STREETS - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Donny swerves past the traffic, narrowly avoiding clipping one of the cars. A moment later, John and Lori come racing out of the tunnel. However, a truck drives through the intersection, stopping them in their tracks.

LORI

Shit!

She pounds on the steering wheel, frantically willing the truck to get out of the way. Finally it does, and they continue on into the city.


EXT. BOSTON CITY STREETS - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Donny’s car races through the streets, pursued by John and Lori, who are catching up again, but are still a ways behind.


INT. DONNY’S CAR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Ted is still on the floor on the passenger’s seat side. He looks around, and spots a “Club” underneath the seat. He glances at Donny, whose eyes are on the road. Ted grabs the club, and scrambles up the seat, taking a swing at Donny. Donny ducks out of the way, and tries to slap Ted away as Ted continues to takes swings at him. A few of them land, eventually drawing blood. Donny smacks Ted away. Ted tumbles back onto the passenger’s seat. Then, with determination, he grabs the Club again, scurries in front of Donny, and locks the Club onto the steering wheel with a snap! Donny’s eyes widen as Ted scrambles into the back seat. Donny tries to turn the wheel, but can’t.
 
118


EXT. BOSTON CITY STREETS - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

Donny’s car swerves out of control, veering up the street, and crashing into a lamppost, fishtailing as it impacts. The airbags go off as the car comes to a stop. Taking advantage of the situation, Ted scrambles out the back window. He catches his fur on a jagged shard of glass, slightly ripping his side. He hangs and struggles for a bit, then drops to the ground. He sways a bit. TED’S POV - We see that his vision is swimming slightly. That little rip has done something... He shakes it off, and runs up the sidewalk. ANGLE ON DONNY, who scrambles out of the wrecked car, followed by Robert. They chase Ted up the street. Ted spots a garage with the door slightly open. He squeezes himself underneath, and disappears inside.

ANGLE ON JOHN AND LORI - They screech to a stop behind Donny’s car. They hurry out, just in time to see Donny and Robert duck underneath the door. They run up the sidewalk after them.


INT. UNDERGROUND AREA - CONTINUOUS

Ted runs down a ramp, looking frantically around for an escape route. He darts off to the left, sprinting up a ramp, followed by Donny and Robert. Ted stops at a red metal fence, and squeezes through, rushing up the stairs on the other side. Donny reaches the fence, but with his larger size he has to climb over the top, which slows him down a bit.

ANGLE ON JOHN AND LORI - We catch them ducking in through the garage door, and running inside. They look around for a beat. ANGLE ON ROBERT, who turns and sees them (Donny has already made it over the fence). ANGLE BACK ON JOHN.

ROBERT (O.S.)

NO!!

John and Lori turn just in time to see Robert charging at them!

ROBERT (CONT’D)

You can’t have my teddy bear!!

When Robert reaches John, John knocks him down with one punch to the face. Robert collapses. Lori and John look down at him.

LORI

Oh my god.
 


 
119

CONTINUED:

JOHN

Sorry, someone had to go Joan Crawford on that kid.
(then)
Come on!

John and Lori run up the ramp, leaving a stunned Robert behind. When they reach the red fence, they look around, but it’s unclear which way Ted and Donny have gone. John continues up the ramp (in the wrong direction) with Lori just behind him.


INT. WALKWAY - CONTINUOUS

Ted runs as fast as his stubby legs will carry him. Donny is in pursuit, and getting closer. The chase moves past a concession area, and up a few flights of stairs.


EXT. UPPER SEATING AREA - CONTINUOUS

Ted runs out onto the upper level, and stops. The camera PIVOTS 180 DEGREES and ascends to reveal the expanse of FENWAY PARK down below. A few lights are on, and one lone maintenance man sweeps the dirt. Donny emerges from the stairwell, which snaps Ted out of it. Ted sprints past the front row of seats, and comes to a dead end. He has nowhere else to go. With Donny closing in, Ted scurries out onto the ledge, and pulls himself up onto the lighting tower. He looks down. From TED’S POV, it’s a long drop. Donny reaches out to grab him, but can’t quite reach. Donny glances down at the drop for a beat, then pulls himself out onto the ledge to go after Ted. Ted climbs farther up the tower.


INT. WALKWAY - CONTINUOUS

John and Lori emerge and continue to look around frantically. They run up the walkway.


EXT. LIGHTING TOWER - CONTINUOUS

Donny pursues Ted up the tower.


EXT. LOWER SEATING AREA - CONTINUOUS

John and Lori emerge into the lower seating section, and run down the aisle, looking around with desperation.
 




 
120

CONTINUED:

LORI
(spotting the action on the
tower)
Look!

John turns and sees the drama playing out on the distant lighting tower.

JOHN
Oh Jesus...
(then)
Stay here.

LORI

Wait, John!	What are you--

JOHN

STAY THERE!!

He turns and runs back up the aisle, toward the concession area.


EXT. LIGHTING TOWER - CONTINUOUS

Ted is starting to gain ground, but he slips, and falls back down. He’s about to pulls himself up again, when Donny grabs one of his legs.


EXT. LOWER SEATING AREA - CONTINUOUS

John continues up the aisle as fast as he can move.


EXT. LIGHTING TOWER - CONTINUOUS

Ted struggles to pull himself from Donny’s grasp, but he can’t. CLOSE UP ON TED’S SIDE - The small rip from earlier begins to tear again. CLOSE UP ON TED’S FACE - His eyes go wide, and for a moment, his face freezes with fear. TED’S POV - His vision swims a bit more. He knows this is not good...


EXT. CONCESSION AREA - CONTINUOUS

John reaches the top of the lower seating area, and sprints past the concession bar, heading for the stairs.
 
121


EXT. LIGHTING TOWER - CONTINUOUS

The struggle continues. As Ted tries to pull himself free, the rip gets bigger. He reacts again, and again we see his vision swimming even more.


EXT. STAIRS - CONTINUOUS

John runs up the stairwell.


EXT. LIGHTING TOWER - CONTINUOUS

The struggle continues. Ted tries to pull himself up, but he’s visibly weakened and his hands are slipping.

EXT. - STAIRS - CONTINUOUS

John continues up the stairwell.


EXT. LIGHTING TOWER - CONTINUOUS

Ted manages to pull free from Donny. He uses all his depleted strength to pull himself farther up.


EXT. UPPER SEATING AREA - CONTINUOUS

John runs past the top of the stairwell, and sprints over toward the lighting tower, just in time to see...


EXT. LIGHTING TOWER - CONTINUOUS

Donny makes one final reach for Ted. He grabs Ted by the foot again, and pulls hard. With one great RRRIIIIIIP, Ted tears into two pieces. As John watches in shock, Ted falls through the air in SLO-MOTION, a shower of white stuffing descending with him. Lori watches with a hand over her mouth. The two halves of Ted land, along with the scattered white stuffing. Donny, still hanging, stares down at the fallen teddy bear. He starts pulling himself back over the ledge.

We lead and follow John as he runs back down through the stadium with desperate numbness. Lori climbs over the edge of the seating area, and runs toward him as well. ANGLE BACK ON DONNY, who pulls himself back over into the upper seating area. He hears the sound of a cop siren, and peers over the edge of the stadium. Seeing a cop car pull up far below, he makes a break for it.
 


 
122

CONTINUED:

Down below, Ted’s top half lies on the grass, looking around in a daze, like a badly wounded soldier for whom there is not much hope. John and Lori race to his side, and kneel down.

JOHN

Ted!

LORI

Oh my God...


TED
(weak, slow breathing)
Johnny...

Ted looks glassy-eyed for a beat. John starts to frantically gather up the chunks of stuffing.

JOHN

Lori, get the stuffing!	Get it all!

Lori starts helping him, desperately grabbing chunks of the white cotton.

TED

Johnny...

John leans back over Ted.

JOHN

You’re gonna be okay, buddy. you understand? You’re gonna be fine.

TED
(weak)
Jesus, I look like the robot from
“Aliens”.

JOHN

No, look at me, buddy. I promise, you’re gonna be okay.

TED

I... I don’t think so. I’m... I’m in trouble. I need... I need to tell you something.

JOHN

What is it?

TED

Don’t... don’t ever lose her again. She’s the most important... most important part of your life.
(MORE)

 
123

CONTINUED:
TED (CONT'D)

Even more than me. She’s your thunder buddy now. She’s--

Ted closes his eyes... and dies. ANGLE DIRECTLY ABOVE TED as we pull away, and it starts to rain...


EXT. JOHN AND LORI’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

The rain is pouring now. Lori’s car pulls up. She and John hurry out, John holding the remains of Ted. They race inside.


INT. JOHN AND LORI’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

John and Lori burst in with the remains of Ted. They’re both drenched from the rain. Lori frantically searches drawers for sewing materials. She finds a needle and thread, and John puts Ted on the table. Lori starts to sew him up as John watches intently.

LORI

John... I don’t know if this is gonna--

JOHN

Just try.	Please.	Just try.

She continues sewing, until she is all finished. They wait. Ted still does not move. John and Lori lower their heads.


INT. LIVING ROOM - SHORTLY AFTER

John sits on the couch, head in hands. Ted still lies on the coffee table. Lori enters with a blanket, and drapes it around him. She sits down next to him, bringing part of the blanket around herself. She places a hand on his shoulder.

LORI

John... I’m sorry. You did everything you could. I’m... I’m just so sorry.

She gently puts an arm around him. There is a thunderclap outside. John does not react.

LORI (CONT’D)
(almost too softly to be
heard)
You’re not afraid...
 





 
124

CONTINUED:

ANGLE ON TED (shortly after) as a white sofa blanket is placed over him. John and Lori shut off the lights, and exit...

DISSOLVE TO:


INT. JOHN AND LORI’S BEDROOM/KITCHEN - NIGHT

John is asleep, but we see that Lori is still lying awake. She sighs restlessly, and gets up. She walks over to the window, and looks out.


EXT. JOHN AND LORI’S APARTMENT - SAME

ANGLE UPWARD - We see a cloudy sky, much like the one from that night when John was a child. As before, there is a small clear patch in the center. A shooting star whizzes by through the opening.


INT. JOHN AND LORI’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Lori’s eyes widen a bit in recognition. She stares at the shooting star for a beat, then closes her eyes and makes a wish...


EXT./ESTAB.	JOHN AND LORI’S APARTMENT - TIME LAPSE


INT. JOHN AND LORI’S BEDROOM - MORNING

John wakes up, looks around groggily, then remembers. He gets out of bed, and walks toward the living room.


INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

He pauses for a beat... and walks in. The blanket is where it was left. John slowly removes it. Ted is still motionless. John lowers his head sadly. Suddenly, Ted’s eyes snap open.

JOHN

Ted!

TED
(retarded-sounding voice)
I’m alive, Johnny!

JOHN

Oh my god!
 


 
125

CONTINUED:

TED
(retarded-sounding voice)
I’m alive!	Your magical wish worked!

JOHN

You’re back!

TED
(retarded-sounding voice)
Yeah! I mean, when you sewed me up, you put some of the stuffing in the wrong places, so I’m a little fucked up. Will you take care of me forever and ever?

John stares at him, confused.

TED (CONT’D)
(normal voice)
Nah, I’m just kiddin’ ya, I thought it’d be funny if you thought I was fuckin’ retarded.

JOHN

You asshole!

John grabs him and hugs him. Lori enters. She sees what’s happening, and a huge smile crosses her face.

LORI

Welcome back, Ted.

John turns to Lori, and realizes...

JOHN

It... it was you. You did it. (cover this line with addition:) It was your wish.

TEDDY
(smiling, speechless)
Son of a bitch...You wished for my life back.

She smiles at him.

LORI
No.	I wished for my life back.	Because
I love you both.

John goes to her, and kisses her passionately.

TED
You were pretty great out there at
Fenway, Johnny.
 


 
126

CONTINUED:

LORI

Yeah, that’s my big brave man.

JOHN

Oh my god, do you know how awesome it was punching a kid? I felt so powerful! I mean if that’s what it’s like to hit a woman, watch out, I liked it.

LORI
(smiling)
I love you.

JOHN
I love you, too.
(then)
And, I want you to know that... I’m probably never gonna be any more than a guy who rents cars, but... I don’t care. You’re the only thing that matters in my life.

TED (O.S.)

Ay--

JOHN

You and Ted.

TED (O.S.)

Yes!

JOHN

And after last night, I... I don’t ever want to lose anyone who matters to me ever again. I’m not gonna wait any longer for my life to start. Lori... will you marry me?

LORI
(beat, she smiles)
That’s all I ever wanted.

John and Lori kiss as we pull away...

NARRATOR (V.O.)

And so John, Lori, and Ted lived happily ever after, having discovered at last that all they really needed was each other. John and Lori were married in a beautiful ceremony in Cambridge, by a very special Justice of the Peace.
 
127


INT. CHURCH - DAY

We hear the Flash Gordon Wedding March as we ANGLE ON Sam J. Jones standing in robes at the altar. Ted, in a tux, stands in the best man’s position. John stands on the steps smiling and looking out as we cut to...

ANGLE ON Lori, walking down the aisle in a wedding dress, smiling warmly. TIME CUT to shortly after, as Sam Jones addresses the two of them, standing at the altar.

SAM JONES

I now pronounce you man and wife. You may kiss the bride.

John and Lori kiss each other. They turn and wave to the cheering crowd. Ted waves happily to John, who waves back. John and Lori run down the aisle joyfully, passing pews full of people from the movie: Lori’s co-workers, John’s co-workers, (Guy sitting with HIS BOYFRIEND, Alix and Tanya, etc.).


EXT. OLD BOSTON CHURCH - CONTINUOUS

John and Lori come running out of the church, as the crowd throws rice at them. They run to a waiting limo with a “Just Married” sign on the back. John gets in, and Lori turns to throw the bouquet toward Gina, Michelle, Tracy, and Tanya. Tanya catches it. She turns and smiles at Alix. Then suddenly, Tami-Lynn bursts into frame, punching Tanya in the jaw. Tanya goes down as Tami-Lynn tackles her, and the crowd tries to pull her off. ANGLE ON the limo as it pulls away...

Ted stands next to Sam J. Jones, watching with a smile as his best friend heads off.

TED

Y’know Sam, there’s only one way to end a perfect day.

SAM JONES

What’s that?


TED

On three.

SAM JONES

What on three?

TED

Flash jump.
