ORCHESTRA TUNING, audience settling. High officials in glassed-in boxes toast each other. Doors closing...

BAM – from behind the orchestra – TERRORISTS with MACHINE GUNS BURST in... The audience SCREAMS... The terrorists cover the ordinary people – the HIGH OFFICIALS are held in the BOXES...


INT./EXT. VAN, PLAZA, DOWNTOWN KIEV, UKRAINE – DAY

As POLICE FLOOD THE PLAZA, the DRIVER turns to the PASSENGER –

DRIVER
(in Ukrainian)
– Wake up the Americans. –

The Passenger turns to the back where four BLACK-CLAD YOUNG MEN SIT, WAITING. The nearest one seems to be SLEEPING...

PASSENGER

Hey –

EYES CLOSED, the young man COCKS his weapon, chambering a round, POPS it out of the slide, CATCHES it, opens his eyes – this is THE PROTAGONIST...

The Passenger nods, ‘okay’. The Driver looks down at a VARIETY OF UNIFORM PATCHES...

SIRENS. The Americans shoulder WEAPONS, pull on HELMETS...

A UKRAINIAN SWAT VAN SCREECHES to a halt outside the theatre –

The Passenger spots its markings – TOSSES the corresponding patches to the Americans, who slap them onto their shoulders.

Ukrainian SWATs pour out of the SWAT van –

The Americans JUMP out of the back of their van, SLIPPING UNNOTICED INTO THE STREAM OF SWATS pouring into the lobby...

INT. LOBBY, CONCERT HALL – CONTINUOUS

SWATs mass at each entrance... the Protagonist watches GAS CANISTERS brought in TO THE AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM. The SWATs pull on GAS MASKS...


INT. BOX, CONCERT HALL – CONTINUOUS

A WELL-DRESSED MAN sitting next to a UNIFORMED OFFICIAL looks down into the stalls – people SLUMP, UNCONSCIOUS, IN A WAVE...
 
2.


He turns to the Official – who motions calm, draws a SIDEARM...


INT. THEATRE, CONCERT HALL – CONTINUOUS

A Terrorist wets a rag in a drinking fountain, ties it around his nose and mouth. Others have WORKMAN’S RESPIRATORS AND FACE MASKS. They COCK THEIR WEAPONS, preparing...


INT. LOBBY, CONCERT HALL – CONTINUOUS

THE SWATS BREACH – POURING into the theatre – exchange GUNFIRE with the TERRORISTS...


INT. CURVING CORRIDOR – DAY

RUNNING. Fast but silent...

FOLLOW the four Americans – they hit a junction – hand signals – they SPLIT two ways –

FOLLOW two of them – one of them PEELS OFF up a staircase – FOLLOW the last, the Protagonist – checking each box...


INT. BOX, CONCERT HALL – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist BURSTS in – takes out the Official beside the Well-Dressed Man –

PROTAGONIST

We live in a twilight world...

The Well-Dressed Man stares, shocked –

PROTAGONIST (CONT'D)

We live in a twilight world...

WELL-DRESSED MAN
(focuses)
And there are no friends at dusk.

PROTAGONIST

You’ve been made. This siege is a blind for them to vanish you.

WELL-DRESSED MAN

But I’ve established contact –

PROTAGONIST

Bring you in or kill you – I have two minutes. Make up your mind.

The Well-Dressed Man nods, climbs to his feet...
 
3.


PROTAGONIST (CONT'D)

Where’s the package?

WELL-DRESSED MAN

Coat check.

He hands the Protagonist a numbered ticket.


INT. CORRIDOR, CONCERT HALL – CONTINUOUS

The battle between SWATs and Terrorists rages... SWATS move down the corridor, checking the boxes one by one...


INT. BOX, CONCERT HALL – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist SMASHES the glass – checks the drop to the stalls, pulls out a black rope, ties it to a column...

As they DROP, Terrorist gunfire rings out – they LAND – hiding amongst the UNCONSCIOUS AUDIENCE. The Well-Dressed Man takes a seat, FEIGNS SLEEP – the Protagonist ROLLS under the seats –

BLAM! Terrorists near the stage open fire – SHOTS ring out – hitting two sleeping audience members, nearby – the Well-Dressed Man TWITCHES – the Protagonist holds his ankle – urging him to keep still –

BLAM! A third sleeping audience member is shot – the Protagonist jumps up, DRAWING THE TERRORISTS’ fire away from the Well-Dressed Man –

The Protagonist races towards two REAL UKRAINIAN SWATS who cover him from the Terrorists – one of them goes down.

The Protagonist takes cover beside the real UKRAINIAN SWAT – WHO IS PLANTING A BOMB UNDER THE SEATS... he gestures to the dead SWAT’s pack... the Protagonist unzips the bag to find a BOMB, COUNTING DOWN IN SYNC WITH THE OTHER BOMB –

UKRAINIAN SWAT
(in Ukrainian, impatient)
– What’re you doing? –

The Ukrainian SWAT uses his gun to PROD the Velcro patch on the Protagonist’s shoulder. It FALLS OFF...

UKRAINIAN SWAT (CONT'D)
(in Ukrainian)
– Who are you? –

The Protagonist is at a loss... BAM! The Ukrainian SWAT is taken out by another ‘SWAT’ –

‘SWAT’

No friends at dusk, huh?
 
4.


PROTAGONIST

You’ll do.

The Protagonist GRABS the bombs, points at the Well-Dressed Man –

PROTAGONIST (CONT'D)
(to the ‘SWAT’)
Get him to the rally point.

The ‘SWAT’ leads the Well-Dressed Man down a fire exit –


INT. LOBBY, CONCERT HALL – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist RACES across the lobby, gunfire RINGING OUT – LEAPS over the counter into the COAT-CHECK AREA...

Landing on the floor next to an unconscious coat-check girl. He spots another bomb – ‘4:23’, ‘4:22’... the Protagonist checks the number on the coat-check ticket and efficiently moves across numbered racks until he finds a SPORTS BAG.

He unzips it to find a BLACK METALLIC OBJECT the size of a softball.

He stuffs it into his pack and SCRAMBLES over the counter...


INT. SERVICE CORRIDOR – CONTINUOUS

– the Protagonist RUNS, checking numbers on doors... he STOPS at a door, THROWS it open, JUMPS in low –


INT. UTILITY ROOM – CONTINUOUS

THREE ‘SWATS’, guns trained, and the Well-Dressed Man. The Protagonist throws a bomb to SWAT 2, then shows the OBJECT to the Well-Dressed Man –

PROTAGONIST

I’ve never seen encapsulation like this.

WELL-DRESSED MAN

We don’t know how old it is. It’s the real deal.

PROTAGONIST

Did you have an out?

WELL-DRESSED MAN

Service tunnels to sewers.

PROTAGONIST

Swap clothes.
 
5.


The ‘SWAT’ and the Well-Dressed Man start changing. The Protagonist hands SWAT 3 the object –

PROTAGONIST (CONT'D) Take this, take him, take his exit. I don’t trust ours any more.
(to SWAT 2)
Can you defuse it?

SWAT 2
(shakes head)
Centrally synchronized. Are there more?

The Protagonist nods, STUFFS the bomb in his pack –

PROTAGONIST

Covering their tracks.

SWAT 2

Taking out the audience?

PROTAGONIST

Just the cheap seats.

SWAT 3

Not our mission –

PROTAGONIST

Mine, now.

The newly dressed ‘TARGET’ steps up –

‘TARGET’

I’m with you – the Ukrainians are expecting a passenger.


INT. THEATRE, CONCERT HALL – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist and the ‘Target’ race through the SLEEPING AUDIENCE COLLECTING BOMBS – the TIMERS tick down – ‘1:58’, ‘1:57’.

Crouched at a bomb, the Protagonist notices a BULLET HOLE in the side of the chair – a TINY WHIFF OF SMOKE GATHERING...

CLICK – a gun is to his head – he spins around to see a

SWAT... ‘0:34’, ‘0:33’... The ‘Target’ has his own gun on the SWAT – A STAND-OFF – all around them, UNCONSCIOUS CIVILIANS...

PROTAGONIST

Walk away – you don’t need to kill these people.

The Protagonist turns back to the bomb... ‘0:32’, ‘0:31’. At the bullet hole the PUFF OF SMOKE THICKENS...
 
6.


the Protagonist, confused, REACHES towards it... the SWAT COCKS his weapon...

BLAM! With EXPLOSIVE FORCE THE BULLET HOLE DISAPPEARS – A NICK HAS APPEARED IN THE PROTAGONIST’S UNIFORM – he SPINS – the SWAT is SHOT THROUGH THE CHEST AND DROPS... revealing a FIGURE, also in a gas mask and tactical gear...

The Figure TURNS – the Protagonist sees, on the Figure’s pack, a small TALISMAN – a COIN with a hole tied to a zip by ORANGE AND YELLOW THREAD – the Protagonist turns back to grab the bomb –

‘TARGET’

That wasn’t one of us.

PROTAGONIST

I’ll take the help.

The Protagonist GRABS the last bomb: ‘0:03’... he looks up to the boxes, where REAL SWATS EVACUATE THE HIGH OFFICIALS... THE PROTAGONIST LOBS THE BOMBS UP INTO THE BOXES...


EXT. PLAZA, DOWNTOWN KIEV – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist and ‘Target’ emerge – an EXPLOSION above them -


INT. THEATRE, CONCERT HALL – CONTINUOUS

INNOCENT CIVILIANS STIR under the EXPLOSION IN THE BOXES –


EXT. PLAZA, DOWNTOWN KIEV – CONTINUOUS

The van PULLS UP – rear door open – they JUMP INSIDE –


INT. VAN – MOMENTS LATER

The Protagonist pulls off his mask. BREATHING. The Passenger turns – grabs the ‘Target’s face, SOMETHING WRONG... the Protagonist turns to the Driver – WHO HAS A GUN POINTED AT HIM ...

BLACK SCREEN:

SCREAMING. The Protagonist’s screaming. Close on his eyes – FLICKERING, SWEATING, PLEADING, DEFIANT... and we are –


EXT. RAIL YARDS – DAY

The Protagonist, tied to a chair, in a windswept rail yard. In front of him, the ‘Target’, also tied to a chair, back to us. The Driver steps back, SWEATING. BLOODY PLIERS in hand.
 
7.


DRIVER
(breathless)
A man can be trained to hold out
for about eighteen hours.

The Driver gestures at a CLOCK on a table –

DRIVER (CONT'D)

So your colleagues will clear by 7.

The Driver PUSHES the ‘Target’s chair over. The ‘Target’ lands hard on his side on the gravel. Groaning.

DRIVER (CONT'D)

He didn’t last eighteen minutes.

The Driver pulls out a KNIFE. Leans in to the Protagonist –

DRIVER (CONT'D)

But he didn’t have anything to hide. You were smuggling a nobody.

The knife moves towards the Protagonist’s throat...

DRIVER (CONT'D)

Risky.

...then to his collar – which he CUTS –

DRIVER (CONT'D)

Or were you counting on this?

...pulling out a SILVER CAPSULE. The Protagonist stares.

DRIVER (CONT'D)

Death, CIA issue.

The Driver TOSSES the pill, WAVES the pliers at the clock –

DRIVER (CONT'D)

Spare yourself once they’re clear.

The Protagonist looks at the clock – ‘5:38’. A FREIGHT TRAIN RUMBLES PAST, CLOSE... As we close in on the clock, THE PROTAGONIST’S SCREAMS ARE DROWNED OUT BY THE FREIGHT TRAIN...

The Driver steps back. The Protagonist breathes heavy, blood dribbling... the Driver follows his gaze to the clock – ‘6:53’ – then checks his watch. Frowns theatrically, picks up the clock, SHAKES it –

DRIVER (CONT'D)

Running fast...

The Driver SETS THE HANDS BACK ONE HOUR. The Protagonist watches, DESPAIRING... as the Driver puts the clock back on the table, the Protagonist notices the ‘Target’s FINGERS WIGGLING... in them is a SILVER PILL...
 
8.


Freight trains rumble past in opposite directions, sound BUILDING... The Driver approaches, bloody pliers in hand –

PROTAGONIST

We were alone.

DRIVER
I didn’t ask. Which means we’re
finally getting somewhere.

The Protagonist HURLS himself onto the ‘Target’s hands – face SMASHING – gets the PILL into his mouth – BITES DOWN – DEAFENING TRAIN NOISE...

Arms GRAB at him – HANDS PRY his jaw as he SEIZES, MOUTH FOAMING... the Protagonist’s EYES GLAZE and we –

CUT TO:

Black screen.

Supertitle:

TENET

FADE IN:

The Protagonist opens his eyes. A man stands beside his bed.

SWAYING gently. This is FAY.

FAY

Welcome to the afterlife.

The Protagonist lifts his head and we are –


INT. BOAT AT SEA – DAY

The Protagonist sees the STEELY OCEAN SWELL...

FAY

You’ve been in a medically induced coma while we got you out of Ukraine and rebuilt your mouth.

PROTAGONIST

The pills are fake?

FAY

We swapped yours for a sedative.

PROTAGONIST

Why?

FAY

A test.

The Protagonist runs a finger around his mouth. REALIZING.
 
9.


PROTAGONIST

Test? They pulled my teeth out.

Fay lets that dissipate. The Protagonist closes his eyes.

PROTAGONIST (CONT'D)

Did the team get clear?

FAY

No. Private Russians, we think.

PROTAGONIST

Somebody talked.

FAY

Not you. You chose to die instead of giving up your colleagues.


EXT. DECK OF THE BOAT – LATER

The Protagonist stands in the wind, contemplating the horizon.

FAY (O.S.)

We all believe we’d run into the burning building, but until we feel that heat... we can never know. You do.

PROTAGONIST

I resign.

FAY
You don’t work for us – you’re
dead.

The Protagonist turns to Fay, confused.

FAY (CONT'D)

Your duty transcends national interests. This is about survival.

PROTAGONIST

Whose?

FAY

Everyone’s. There’s a cold war. Cold as ice. To even know its true nature is to lose. This is knowledge divided – all I have for you is a gesture –

(interlaces his fingers) – in combination with a word – ‘tenet’. Use it carefully, it’ll open the right doors, but some of the wrong ones, too.
 
10.


PROTAGONIST

That’s all they’ve told you?

FAY
The test you passed?
(beat)
Not everybody does.

Fay breaks eye contact with the Protagonist. The boat continues to nose into the swell.


EXT. LAUNCH, WIND FARM AT SEA – DUSK

The Protagonist is driven away from the boat on a launch, towards the GIANT WHITE TURBINES of the ocean wind farm.

The launch SLIPS amongst them, seeking the ladder of a particular one...

The Protagonist climbs the ladder to a door. He tries it – it’s open. He turns to see the launch move off into the gathering dark. The Protagonist ENTERS the wind turbine.


INT. WIND TURBINE – CONTINUOUS

In the bare space, the Protagonist finds a SPORTS BAG, a COT, a pallet of WATER and PROTEIN BARS. He opens the sports bag to find passports, cash, credit cards and a HI-VIZ VEST.

Under the vest is a small black cylinder. He unscrews the top to find three SILVER SUICIDE PILLS. The Protagonist shakes his head as he tosses them back into the bag.


INT. WIND TURBINE – LATER

The Protagonist EATS, DRINKS and EXERCISES by CLIMBING the endless interior ladder of the turbine. The stash of food and water SHRINKS...

The Protagonist does PULL-UPS at the very top of the ladder, FEET DANGLING over the VERTIGINOUS DROP...


INT. WIND TURBINE – MORNING

The Protagonist is woken by a repeated AIR HORN. He pulls himself off the cot, opens the door to find –


EXT. WIND TURBINE – CONTINUOUS

A large CATAMARAN nosed up to the windmill, ladder in place, MAINTENANCE CREW in HI-VIZ VESTS moving on and off the turbine. Other boats service other turbines. The Protagonist pulls on his VEST and CLIMBS down onto the catamaran.
 
11.


EXT. EUROPEAN PORT – DAY

The Protagonist disembarks with the rest of the wind-farm crew. As they file past a car the driver, also in hi-viz, steps out into line, leaving the door open, engine running. The Protagonist gets in. The GPS is already set...


EXT. OFFICE COMPLEX – LATER

A bland suburban office park. The Protagonist gets out of the car, wearing his hi-viz and carrying a clipboard. Heads inside, passing numerous STAFF coming out...


INT. LOBBY, OFFICE COMPLEX – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist moves through the lobby unimpeded. Checking the tenant listings he sees – ‘WINDFARM TRANSITIONS – B-2’.

INT. CORRIDOR – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist walks up to B-2.

FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)

With a hi-viz vest and a clipboard, you can get almost anywhere. Almost.

The Protagonist turns to find a brusque young woman. This is BARBARA. He joins his hands, interlacing the fingers...

PROTAGONIST

A pretty obscure tenet.

Using a key card, she ushers him through a door into –


INT. OFFICE, LABORATORY – CONTINUOUS

Barbara hands the Protagonist a cup of tea.

BARBARA

No small talk, nothing that might reveal who we are, or what we do.

PROTAGONIST
I thought I was here to find out
what we do.

BARBARA

You’re not here for ‘what’, you’re here for ‘how’. ‘What’ is your department. And not my business.
 
12.


PROTAGONIST

Well, to do what I do, I need some idea of the threat we face.

Barbara considers the Protagonist. Sips her tea.

BARBARA

As I understand it, we’re trying to prevent World War Three.

PROTAGONIST

Nuclear holocaust?

BARBARA

No. Something worse.


INT. SHOOTING RANGE – MOMENTS LATER

Barbara hands the Protagonist a semi-automatic. He reflexively checks the chamber and magazine – EMPTY.

BARBARA

Aim it and pull the trigger.

The Protagonist SHRUGS, lifts the empty pistol, sights a target 25m away with several holes in it...

He squeezes the trigger – BAM! – a shot. He is CONFUSED...

BARBARA (CONT'D)

Check the magazine.

The Protagonist checks the clip – THERE IS A ROUND IN IT.

PROTAGONIST

How?

Barbara pulls on PROTECTIVE GLOVES and removes the round from the clip, placing it next to an identical one on a table.

BARBARA

One of these bullets is, like us, travelling forwards through time. The other one’s going backwards. Can you tell which is which?

The Protagonist shakes his head. Barbara reaches forward –

BARBARA (CONT'D)

How about now? –

One of the rounds FLIES UP INTO HER HAND, FALLING IN REVERSE. The Protagonist is taken aback. Barbara holds the round towards him so he can inspect it –
 
13.


BARBARA (CONT'D)

It’s inverted – its entropy runs backwards. So, to our eyes, its movement is reversed. We think it’s a type of inverse radiation, triggered by nuclear fission.

PROTAGONIST

You didn’t make it?

BARBARA

We don’t know how. Yet.

PROTAGONIST

So where’d it come from?

BARBARA

Someone’s manufacturing them in the future. They’re streaming back at us.

Barbara places the round on the table, in front of a CAMERA.

BARBARA (CONT'D)

Try it.

He puts on a glove – moves his hand over it, nothing.

BARBARA (CONT'D)

You have to have dropped it.

The Protagonist reaches out again – it LEAPS UP INTO HIS HAND.

PROTAGONIST

How can it move before I touch it?

She cues up the recording of what he just did –

BARBARA

From your point of view you caught it, but from the bullet’s point of view...

She plays it BACKWARDS –

BARBARA (CONT'D)

...you dropped it.

ON THE SCREEN: the round FALLS from his hand.

PROTAGONIST
But cause has to come before
effect.

BARBARA

No. That’s just how we see time.
 
14.


She PULLS the round towards herself using one finger – the round follows her finger as if MAGNETIZED...

PROTAGONIST

What about free will?

BARBARA

That bullet wouldn’t have moved if you hadn’t put your hand there. Either way we run the tape, you made it happen.

She LAUNCHES it up into her other hand –

BARBARA (CONT'D)
Don’t try to understand it. Feel
it.

Barbara PLAYS with the round in increasingly IMPROBABLE, BEAUTIFUL MOVEMENTS... The round SHOOTS AWAY FROM HER – the Protagonist CATCHES IT...

PROTAGONIST

Instinct. Got it.

Barbara smiles, swaps him the round for the pistol. She then places a TRAY COVERED IN SHELL CASINGS beside him.

The Protagonist aims at the target – a shell casing LEAPS into the gun – he FIRES, and a bullet hole near the bullseye VANISHES –

PROTAGONIST (CONT'D)

Why does it feel so strange?

BARBARA
You’re not shooting the bullet,
you’re catching it.

PROTAGONIST

Whoa.

The Protagonist examines the target – no bullet holes.

PROTAGONIST (CONT'D) I’ve seen this type of ammunition before.

BARBARA

In the field?

PROTAGONIST

I was almost hit.

BARBARA

Then you are exceedingly lucky...

The Protagonist turns to her...
 
15.


BARBARA (CONT'D)

An inverted bullet passing through your body would be devastating. The inverse radiation would spread through your body. Like polonium poisoning. Not pretty.

The Protagonist examines the rounds...

PROTAGONIST

These look like today’s.

BARBARA

They may have been made today, then inverted years from now.

PROTAGONIST

Where did you get them?

BARBARA

They came with the wall. I was assigned it, like all the material I’m studying here.

PROTAGONIST
Do you have an analysis of the
metals?

BARBARA

Sure. Why?

PROTAGONIST

The mixture of alloys can tell me where they might have been made. Look, I know you said that ‘what’ is my business –

BARBARA

Let’s not go off-topic.

PROTAGONIST

I’m not seeing Armageddon here.

Barbara takes the round from him, and beckons him to follow –


INT. ARCHIVE – CONTINUOUS

Between tall sets of DRAWERS...

BARBARA

A bullet may not seem like much, but it’s a simple machine – lead bullet, brass casing, gunpowder. If they can invert this – I see no reason they couldn’t invert pretty much anything. Even a nuclear weapon can only affect our future.
(MORE)
 
16.

BARBARA (CONT'D)

An inverted weapon might be able to affect our past as well.

Barbara stops at a drawer. Gestures around herself –

BARBARA (CONT'D)

Now that we know what to look for, we’re finding more and more inverted material...

She opens a drawer, revealing a VARIETY OF RUSTED BITS AND PIECES – SCREWS, CRACKED LENSES, METAL RODS, BUTTONS...

BARBARA (CONT'D)

...remnants of complex objects.

The Protagonist reaches out and lets a RUSTED BUCKLE leap into his hand.

PROTAGONIST

So what do you think we’re seeing?

BARBARA

The detritus of a coming war.

The Protagonist looks around at the MULTITUDE of DRAWERS.


EXT. CROWDED STREET, MUMBAI – DAY

The Protagonist walks out of an electronics store, opening a new phone, and slips into the throng. He dials –

MALE VOICE
(over phone)
Yup?

PROTAGONIST

We live in a twilight world.

MALE VOICE
(over phone)
No friends at dusk. I was told
you’d left the building.

PROTAGONIST

Even the dead need allies.

MALE VOICE
(over phone)
Specifically?

PROTAGONIST
An assist in Mumbai. To get to
Sanjay Singh.
 
17.


MALE VOICE
(over phone)
Singh? He never leaves his house, and his house... well, it’s –

PROTAGONIST

Yes, it is – I’m looking right at it.

Above the bustling street, a HIGH-RISE HOUSE, at least twenty storeys tall, with two large balconies, towers over...

MALE VOICE
(over phone)
I’ll see who’s on deck. Bombay
Yacht Club, two hours.

As the Protagonist hangs up, he spots a figure, on the top balcony. A WOMAN IN A SARI, standing high above the city.

INT. BOMBAY YACHT CLUB – EVENING

The Protagonist enters the quiet ex-colonial establishment.

Takes a seat. A BUSINESSMAN sits down next to him.

BUSINESSMAN

It seems you need an introduction to a prominent Mumbai local on short notice. I’m Neil.

Neil offers his hand. The Protagonist takes it –

PROTAGONIST
I need an audience with Sanjay
Singh.

NEIL

Not possible.

PROTAGONIST

Ten minutes, tops.

NEIL

Time isn’t the problem. Getting out alive’s the problem.
(thinks)
Would you take a child hostage?

The Protagonist shakes his head.

NEIL (CONT'D)

A woman?

PROTAGONIST
If I had to. I’m not looking to
make much noise here.
 
18.


Neil keeps thinking. Signals a waiter –

NEIL
Vodka tonic.
(gestures at the
Protagonist)
Diet Coke.

The Protagonist stares at Neil. Neil looks up, confused.

NEIL (CONT'D)

What? You never drink on the job.

PROTAGONIST

You’re well informed.

NEIL

It pays to be in our profession.

PROTAGONIST

Well, I prefer club soda.

NEIL
(grins)
No, you don’t.

Neil raps his knuckles on the table, thinking.

NEIL (CONT'D)

How’s your parachuting?

PROTAGONIST

Broke an ankle in basic training. Singh’s house isn’t tall enough to parachute off of.

NEIL
(thinks)
But it’s bungee-jumpable.

PROTAGONIST

I don’t think ‘bungee-jumpable’ is a word.

NEIL

It may not be a word, but it may be your only way out of that place.
(a thought occurs)
Or into it, for that matter.


EXT. HIGH-RISE HOUSE – EVENING

ARMED GUARDS patrol the balconies.
 
19.


INT. HIGH-RISE HOUSE – CONTINUOUS

Inside one of the magnificent rooms, a middle-aged Indian man mixes drinks. This is SANJAY SINGH.


EXT. LOW ROOFTOP NEXT DOOR TO HIGH-RISE HOUSE – CONTINUOUS

Neil and the Protagonist race across the roof carrying a sports bag. Neil pulls out a WINCH, the Protagonist pulls out a large CATAPULT, loops it around two pipes, glancing down into the WALLED YARD at the foot of the high-rise house.

Neil BOLTS the winch to the roof, the Protagonist sights the upper balcony of the high-rise house, FIRES a ball with a line up and over the balcony railing...


EXT. HIGH-RISE HOUSE – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist and Neil lie next to each other as the WINCH RUNS, TENSIONING THEIR ELASTIC LINES... they LAUNCH themselves, FLYING UP to land against the side of the building –

They RUN SILENTLY UP THE BUILDING, onto the UPPER TERRACES, SHOOTING TWO GUARDS with silenced pistols...


INT./EXT. HIGH-RISE HOUSE – CONTINUOUS

Sanjay Singh hands a drink to the Woman in the sari. They move out onto the balcony –


EXT. BALCONY – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist surprises Sanjay, holds him at gunpoint –

PROTAGONIST
(to the Woman)
Stay back.
(to Sanjay)
I was almost taken out by a very
unusual type of ammunition in
Ukraine. I want to know who
supplied it.

SANJAY
My name’s Sanjay. And you are?
(silence)
No chit-chat?

The Woman pushes a RED BUTTON on the wall –
 
20.


PROTAGONIST

There’s no one at the other end. No one who’s going to help you, anyway.


INT. SECURITY STATION, HIGH-RISE HOUSE – CONTINUOUS

An alarm buzzes, the Security Guards are frozen, Neil has a gun on them, a finger to his lips...


EXT. BALCONY, HIGH-RISE HOUSE – CONTINUOUS

Sanjay tries to turn to see the Protagonist –

SANJAY

Why would I know who supplied it?

The Protagonist pushes his head back around with the gun –

PROTAGONIST

The combination of metals is unique to India. If it’s from India, it’s from you.

SANJAY

A fair assumption –

PROTAGONIST

Deduction.

SANJAY

Deduction, then. Look, my friend, guns are never conducive to a productive negotiation.

PROTAGONIST
I’m not the man they send to
negotiate...

He COCKS his weapon – puts the gun to Sanjay’s head –

PROTAGONIST (CONT'D)

But I am the man people talk to.

SANJAY
(charm curdles)
I can’t. I can’t tell you.

PROTAGONIST
You’re an arms dealer, friend –
this may be the easiest trigger
I’ve ever had to pull.
 
21.


WOMAN (O.S.)

To say anything about a client would violate the tenets he lives by...

The Protagonist GLANCES at the Woman... whose fingers are casually INTERTWINED. The Protagonist brings his free hand up to hold the gun in both hands, fingers INTERLACED...

PROTAGONIST

If tenets are important to you, then you can tell me. Everything.

WOMAN
Not while you have a gun to my
husband’s head.

The Protagonist releases him.

WOMAN (CONT'D)

Sanjay, make us a drink.


INT. TERRACE OVERLOOKING MUMBAI, SANJAY’S HOUSE – LATER

Overlooking the extraordinary bustle of the city. Sanjay has left. His wife hands the Protagonist his drink –

PRIYA

I’m Priya Singh.

PROTAGONIST

This is your operation?

PRIYA

A masculine front in a man’s world has its uses. The dealer you’re looking for is Andrei Sator.

PROTAGONIST

The Russian oligarch?

PRIYA

You know him?

PROTAGONIST

Not personally. Made his billions in gas, moved to London and married an English girl. Said to be on the outs with Moscow.

PRIYA

Very good. Except the ‘gas’ he made his billions from was actually plutonium, and he’s said to be on the outs so he can feed British Intelligence whatever the Russians want them to think they know.
 
22.


PROTAGONIST

None of which explains how or why you sold him inverted munitions.

PRIYA
When I sold him the rounds, they
were perfectly ordinary.

PROTAGONIST

So how did he get them inverted?

PRIYA

We believe he’s functioning as some kind of broker between our time and the future.

PROTAGONIST

He can communicate with the future?

PRIYA

We all do. Credit cards, email, text – anything that goes into the record speaks directly to the future. The question is – can the future speak back? And, if so, what are they saying?

PROTAGONIST

And I’m supposed to find out?

PRIYA

To get anywhere near Sator would take a fresh-faced protagonist...

She reaches up to touch his cheek.

PRIYA (CONT'D)

Fresh as a daisy. Get close, find out what he’s receiving and how.

PROTAGONIST
Is it safe to involve British
Intelligence?

PRIYA
I have a contact who’s out of
Sator’s reach.

PROTAGONIST

One of us?

PRIYA
No, he thinks we’re chasing
plutonium.

SIRENS. BANGS! Priya looks over to see POLICE CARS arriving far below, in the WALLED YARD at the foot of her house...
 
23.


PRIYA (CONT'D)

You’d better get out of here.

PROTAGONIST

Can’t you explain things?

PRIYA

You have to start looking at the world in a new way – this conflict runs backwards and forwards simultaneously. Your name on a police report reveals your identity to the future – they pass it back to Sator –

PROTAGONIST

My cover’s blown before I get near him.

PRIYA

You got in – you must’ve had a plan for getting out.

The Protagonist pulls a CLIP and cord from his harness –

PROTAGONIST

Not one I loved.

Priya watches him clip onto the balcony rail. Neil FLIES PAST, dropping from the balcony above.

The Protagonist JUMPS, SLOWING as he DROPS BEHIND THE WALL, OUT OF REACH OF THE POLICE, into a MARKET STREET and RELEASES his harness – disappearing into the crowd...


EXT. MEMBER’S CLUB, LONDON – DAY

The Protagonist walks down the busy Mall, and up the steps...


INT. MEMBER’S CLUB, LONDON – DAY

The Protagonist enters, is approached by a STEWARD.

STEWARD

Can I help you, sir?

PROTAGONIST

I’m Mr Crosby’s lunch.

STEWARD
I presume you mean Sir Michael
Crosby’s lunch?

PROTAGONIST

Presume away.
 
24.


STEWARD

If you’ll follow me.


INT. LOUNGE, MEMBER’S CLUB – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist is shown to a table where a distinguished middle-aged man is already eating. CROSBY.

CROSBY

Started without you, hope you don’t mind.

PROTAGONIST
I’ll catch up.
(to the Steward)
Same for me.

STEWARD

I’ll send the waiter.

PROTAGONIST

No, just pass on the order.

Crosby smiles at the Protagonist’s handling of the Steward.

CROSBY
I gather you’ve an interest in a
certain Russian national.

PROTAGONIST
Anglo-Russian. So I’ll have to
watch my step.

CROSBY

Indeed. He’s tapped into the intelligence services – I’ve warned them he’s feeding them rubbish, but they don’t seem to care.

PROTAGONIST

Tell me about him.

CROSBY
I assume you’re familiar with the
Soviet-era secret cities?

PROTAGONIST

Closed cities, not shown on maps, built up around sensitive industries. Most of them have been opened up and renamed as regular towns.

CROSBY
Not the one Sator grew up in.
Stalsk-12.
(MORE)
 
25.

CROSBY (CONT'D)

In the seventies our people estimated its population at almost 200,000. Unacknowledged to this day. Thought to be abandoned.

PROTAGONIST

Abandoned?

CROSBY

Some kind of accident. After which we think it became a site for underground tests. Just two weeks ago, same day as the Kiev Opera siege, our satellites detected a detonation in north-west Siberia, about where we think Stalsk-12 was.

PROTAGONIST

Nuclear?

CROSBY

Big enough to be noticed. Sator emerged from this blank spot on the map with an ambition that eventually led him here, to buy his way into the British establishment.

PROTAGONIST

Through his wife?

CROSBY
Katherine Barton, eldest niece of
Sir Frederick Barton. She works at
Shipley’s, met Sator at an auction.

PROTAGONIST

He’s into art?

CROSBY

Like a lot of wealthy criminals, he thinks if he covers his walls with tasteful, expensive things it’ll distract from the bloodshed. Judging by the lovely girl he married, there might be something in it.

PROTAGONIST

Happy marriage?

CROSBY

No. Practically estranged.

PROTAGONIST

How do I get to Sator?

CROSBY

Through her, of course.
 
26.


PROTAGONIST

You may have an inflated idea of my powers of seduction.

CROSBY
Hardly. We have an ace in the
hole...

Crosby slides a SHOPPING BAG over to the Protagonist’s feet.

The Protagonist looks inside: a small FRAMED DRAWING.

PROTAGONIST

You’re carrying a Goya in a Harrods bag?

CROSBY

It’s a fake, by a Spaniard named Arepo. One of two we confiscated from an embezzler in Bern. We hung on to this one for a rainy day – I felt the first drops when India called.

PROTAGONIST

What happened to the other one?

CROSBY

A Rubens. It turned up at Shipley’s, where it was authenticated by Katherine Barton before going under the hammer. And who do you suppose bought it?

PROTAGONIST

Her husband? Does she know it’s a forgery?

CROSBY

Hard to say. Rumour had it that she and Arepo were close.

Crosby looks the Protagonist over –

CROSBY (CONT'D)
Look, no offence, but this is a
world where someone claiming to be
a billionaire gets asked if they’re
just a dollar billionaire.

PROTAGONIST

And?

CROSBY

Brooks Brothers won’t cut it.

PROTAGONIST

I’m assuming I have a budget.
 
27.


CROSBY
(tosses him a credit
card)
Save the world, then we’ll balance the books. Can I recommend a tailor?

PROTAGONIST

I’ll manage. You British don’t have a monopoly on snobbery, you know.

CROSBY
Not a monopoly. More of a
controlling interest.

The Protagonist rises, taking the credit card and the bag.

PROTAGONIST

Thanks for this. By the way, is she a Kate or a Kathy?

CROSBY

A Kat, I believe.

The waiter arrives, bearing food, supervised by the Steward.

PROTAGONIST

Could you box that for me?

STEWARD

Certainly not.

The Protagonist smiles at Crosby, who nods goodbye.

PROTAGONIST

Goodbye, Sir Michael.


EXT. WEST LONDON PRIVATE SCHOOL – DAY

Mothers stand at the railings waiting for their kids. One of them, a smart YOUNG WOMAN, stands a little apart from the group. SCHOOLKIDS pile out of the school...


INT./EXT. CAR – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist watches from across the road as the Young Woman SPOTS her son. She offers him her hand, but he reaches up to take his NANNY’S. She moves her hand to pick something off his jumper before he is put into the back of a BLACK RANGE ROVER with tinted windows.

The Protagonist watches the Young Woman wave at the departing car carrying her child. Utterly alone.
 
28.


EXT. SHIPLEY’S, LONDON – DAY

A BENTLEY pulls up – a DOORMAN opens the rear door, the Protagonist emerges, IMMACULATELY TAILORED, holding a beautiful leather briefcase.


INT. SHIPLEY’S – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist is approached by a REPRESENTATIVE –

REPRESENTATIVE

How can I help, sir?

PROTAGONIST

I have an appraisal with Ms Barton.

REPRESENTATIVE
(to receptionist)
Tell Kat her client is in the
Fallow Room.


INT. APPRAISAL ROOM – MOMENTS LATER

The Protagonist admires the paintings on the walls. The door opens and the Young Woman from the school gates comes in, dressed for business. This is KAT BARTON. She looks bemused, but gives him a genuine and friendly smile –

KAT

I’m sorry, I wasn’t notified of any appointments, Mr...

PROTAGONIST

Goya?

KAT

Mr Goya?

The Protagonist opens his briefcase...

PROTAGONIST

No, I’m told you’re the person to see about...

Offers the drawing to her...

PROTAGONIST (CONT'D)

...Goya.

She takes it, suddenly interested...

KAT

Wow. It’s extraordinary.

She lays the drawing on the table and grabs a loupe –
 
29.


PROTAGONIST

What’s it worth?

KAT

Let’s not get ahead of ourselves. There’s a lot of work before any kind of valuation – provenance, microscopic examination, X-rays...

She is bent over the table, peering through the loupe.

The Protagonist studies her reaction as he –

PROTAGONIST

But what does your heart tell you?

She steps back. Something about the drawing BOTHERS her...

KAT
I’m sorry, where did you say you
acquired this drawing?

PROTAGONIST

Tomas Arepo.

Kat rises and turns to face the Protagonist. Cold.

KAT

What do you want?

PROTAGONIST

What I want is complicated.

KAT

Do you work for my husband?

PROTAGONIST

I’ve never met your husband. That’s the reason I’m here. Is there somewhere we can talk?

KAT

In London? Not really.


INT. RESTAURANT – NIGHT

The Protagonist and Kat sit at a corner table.

PROTAGONIST

I bought my Goya for cents on the dollar from an irate Swiss banker. Traced it to Arepo, and realized I’d scored a bargain when he told me who’d paid top dollar for another one of his pictures. Your husband.
 
30.


KAT

Where’s the bargain? Your drawing’s an obvious fake.

PROTAGONIST

My drawing’s a very good fake – you know that better than anyone. The information’s the bargain.

KAT
The information that I helped
defraud my own husband?

PROTAGONIST

He and I are in related businesses, but he’s a hard man to meet. If you and I were to make an arrangement –

KAT
Arrangement? You mean blackmail.
Don’t be afraid of the word – my
husband isn’t. And I’m sorry to
tell you he got there first.

PROTAGONIST
He knows? And he’s never done
anything about it?

KAT

Why would he?

PROTAGONIST

He paid nine million dollars –

KAT
Which would barely cover the
holiday he just forced us on.

PROTAGONIST

Where’d you go – Mars?

KAT

Viet Nam. On our yacht. His yacht.

Kat looks the Protagonist up and down...

KAT (CONT'D)

You’ve got the suit. The shoes, the watch. But I think you’re a little out of your depth.

PROTAGONIST
(sharp)
People who’ve amassed fortunes like your husband’s aren’t generally okay with being cheated out of any of it.
 
31.


Kat sips her wine. Wanting to talk. Knowing she shouldn’t.

KAT

The drawing is his hold over me. He threatened me with the police, prison, the works. He controls me, my contact with my son, everything. Leaving him would never have been easy, now it’s impossible. My life, now... You can’t fight. Just beg. Or worse. In Viet Nam I tried to love him again. If there were still love, he might give me my son. We sat on that bloody boat and watched the sunsets, imitating an earlier time. He seemed happy, so I asked. And he made me an offer. To let me go if I agreed to never see my son again. I expressed myself –

INSERT CUT: a CRYSTAL BOWL of RASPBERRIES SMASHES onto the polished wood of a yacht’s deck –

KAT (CONT'D)

Then took Max ashore. He called us, contrite. But when we came back...

INSERT CUT: Kat and Max on a launch – Kat follows Max’s gaze to see a FEMALE FIGURE SLIDE into the water...

KAT (CONT'D)

I glimpsed some other woman diving off the boat. And he’d vanished. I’ve never felt such envy.

PROTAGONIST

You don’t seem the jealous type.

KAT
Of her. You know how I dream of
just diving off that boat? Of
freedom?

PROTAGONIST

But you share a son.

KAT

And that’s my life.

PROTAGONIST
Did you know the drawing was a
fake?

KAT

The authentication took months – Arepo and I became close, maybe too close. Maybe my judgement was clouded. I failed.
(MORE)
 
32.

KAT (CONT'D)

But Andrei can’t conceive of failure, only betrayal. I didn’t betray my husband. In retrospect, maybe I missed my chance.

PROTAGONIST

And he let Arepo walk free?

KAT

If you’d actually met Arepo, as you claimed, you’d understand that he no longer walks anywhere.

PROTAGONIST

We spoke on the phone –

KAT

He can’t do that, either.
