The Protagonist considers this.

PROTAGONIST

Where’s the drawing?

KAT

Why?

PROTAGONIST

Get me the introduction, I’ll take the drawing out of the equation. No picture, no prosecution. No hold over you.

Kat looks at the Protagonist. Not daring to hope.

PROTAGONIST (CONT'D)
I might just be your second chance
–

KAT
(snaps)
I don’t need redemption.

PROTAGONIST

At betrayal.

A LARGE, WELL-DRESSED THUG sits down at the table. He takes a green bean from the Protagonist’s plate and chews it vacantly. This is VOLKOV. The Protagonist looks at Kat –

PROTAGONIST (CONT'D)
Friend of your husband?
(she nods)
You knew this would happen?
 
33.


KAT
They won’t kill you. Andrei
dislikes tangling with local law
enforcement on that level.

PROTAGONIST

You must really not have liked the look of me.

KAT
(rising)
The look of you is fine. It’s better to get to the nasty part before I care one way or the other.

He takes her hand, pulls her forward to kiss her cheek.

PROTAGONIST
(whispers)
There’s a number in your left coat pocket. Don’t call from home.

A Thug puts a MEATY HAND on the Protagonist’s shoulder.

KAT

You won’t be taking my call.

PROTAGONIST

I might surprise you.

She leaves, BREEZING out through the kitchen... at Volkov’s nod, two Thugs escort the Protagonist from his chair, heading towards the kitchen – a WAITER moves to object – Volkov, eating the Protagonist’s leftovers, pulls the Waiter up short, shaking his head.


EXT. ALLEY BEHIND RESTAURANT – MOMENTS LATER

Kat exits the restaurant, DISTRAUGHT, walking past a waiting THUG, then sliding into the back seat of a MERCEDES.

INT./EXT. MERCEDES – CONTINUOUS

The driver is a GAUNT RUSSIAN.

KAT

Please, let’s go.

The Gaunt Russian does not react, but watches through the rear-view mirror as a THUG enters the kitchen –

KAT (CONT'D)

Can we get going?
 
34.


INT. RESTAURANT KITCHEN – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist enters the kitchen, followed by the two thugs. CHEFS and BUSBOYS retreat as the other thug approaches...


INT./EXT. ALLEY BEHIND RESTAURANT – CONTINUOUS

Kat turns from the window –

KAT

Please!

GAUNT RUSSIAN

He wants you to see...


INT. RESTAURANT KITCHEN – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist JACKKNIFES HIS LOWER LEG UP into the crotch of the thug behind him – SPINS him into the Thug next to him – POTS and Pans flying –


INT. RESTAURANT – CONTINUOUS

Volkov wipes sauce with bread, enjoying noises from the kitchen...


INT. RESTAURANT KITCHEN – CONTINUOUS

The Third Thug SWINGS – the Protagonist DODGES, takes the blow on the shoulder – SLAMS his head into the Third Thug’s neck, leaving him GASPING – the Protagonist GRABS the Third Thug, RACING for the WINDOW...


INT./EXT. MERCEDES – CONTINUOUS

Kat FLINCHES as, with a CRASH of plates, a body TUMBLES down the stairs...

GAUNT RUSSIAN

And he gets what he wants.

Then she sees something else... the Protagonist exits.

KAT

Not always, apparently.


EXT. ALLEY BEHIND RESTAURANT – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist brushes himself clean, SPOTS the Mercedes, starts moving towards it –
 
35.


INT./EXT. MERCEDES – CONTINUOUS

The Gaunt Russian SCRAMBLES to get the car moving. Kat looks back at the Protagonist as the car ROARS away...


EXT. SCHOOL GATES – DAY

Kat is crouched, talking to her son, MAX. The Nanny hovers –

MAX
Anna says we’re going to Pompeii
and see lava.

KAT

We’ll go together. I’ll be there, too.

Max looks up at the Nanny. Kat hugs him, tight. The Nanny TAPS Kat on the shoulder. Kat smiles at her son, tears in her eyes, as the car pulls away. She pulls out her phone, dials... hears a RINGTONE behind her –

The Protagonist is there.

PROTAGONIST
I said I’d surprise you. He’s a
cute kid.

KAT

Max. He’s everything.

PROTAGONIST

Where’s the drawing?

KAT

Oslo. At the airport.

PROTAGONIST

The airport?

INSERT CUT: a Rotas car drives across an airport apron, and down a ramp...

KAT

Do you know what a freeport is?

PROTAGONIST

A storage facility for art that’s been acquired –

...into a SLEEK facility – the OSLO FREEPORT – as a STAFF MEMBER stands ready to greet a new CLIENT...
 
36.


KAT (V.O.)

But not yet taxed. We started a network – Rotas, his construction company, built them, I brought in clients. The facilities are tax havens...

The client is NEIL... he takes in the security arrangements...

PROTAGONIST (V.O.)
The clients can view their
investments –


EXT. OSLO OPERA HOUSE – DAY

The Protagonist is standing on the roof of the Oslo Opera House, briefing Neil...

PROTAGONIST (V.O.)

– without importing them, so they avoid paying tax.

NEIL

Sort of a transit lounge for art?

We go back to Kat, on the street, briefing the Protagonist...

KAT

Art, antiques, anything of value, really.

PROTAGONIST

Anything?

KAT

Anything legal...

Then back to the Protagonist briefing Neil...

PROTAGONIST
But it’s not unlike the Swiss
banking system. Opaque.

Back to Kat –

KAT
Rotas has assets in the Oslo
Freeport. I’m guessing it’s there.

PROTAGONIST

Guessing?

Back to Oslo –

NEIL

Guessing?
 
37.


Back to Kat –

KAT
We make trips there four or five
times a year.

PROTAGONIST

To view art?

KAT

And whatever he does – it turns out art is of no importance to Andrei.

PROTAGONIST

But the freeports are.

Kat nods.


INT. FREEPORT – DAY

A STAFF MEMBER brings Neil into a LUXURIOUS GALLERY –

STAFF MEMBER
Some freeports are just warehouses
– here, you can actually enjoy your possessions...

Then through doors into an ANGLED INNER CORRIDOR...

STAFF MEMBER (CONT'D) The structure of the vaults is based on The Pentagon – each vault a separate structure within the others. Damage to one structure won’t compromise the others.

They arrive at a door in the corridor. The Staff Member uses his thumb to unlock a door –

STAFF MEMBER (CONT'D)
Clients have biometric access
straight in off the tarmac.

NEIL

From the terminal?

STAFF MEMBER
(confused)
From their private planes.

NEIL

Of course.

Neil checks the locks as the Staff Member opens the door into –
 
38.


INT. FREEPORT SHIPPING AREA – CONTINUOUS

A VAST SHIPPING AREA filled with SHIPPING CONTAINERS –

STAFF MEMBER

Our logistics department ships to and from other freeports without customs inspection...

Neil notices ROTAS containers marked for delivery to TALLINN.

NEIL (V.O.)

What’re you hoping to find?


EXT. OSLO OPERA HOUSE – DAY

PROTAGONIST

You really want to know?

NEIL

I’m not sure.

PROTAGONIST

Bring some lead-lined gloves.

NEIL

Jesus. Nuclear?

PROTAGONIST

When you’re on the tour –


INT. FREEPORT – DAY

Neil is shown back into one of the vaults...

PROTAGONIST (V.O.)
Pay attention to the fire
precautions.

NEIL

Documents are vulnerable to –

STAFF MEMBER

Fire. Absolutely –

NEIL
I was going to say, water damage
from sprinkler systems.

STAFF MEMBER
We don’t use sprinklers.
(points to vents)
The facility is flooded with halide gas, displacing all the air within seconds.
 
39.


NEIL

Can you show me?

STAFF MEMBER

If I did, we’d suffocate.

NEIL

What about the staff in here?

STAFF MEMBER

Halide only fills the vaults – they just have to get into the corridor. There’s a ten-second warning.

NEIL

You only give them ten seconds?

STAFF MEMBER

Our clients use us because we have no priorities above their property.

NEIL

Blimey.

STAFF MEMBER

Well, sir, you asked.


INT. OSLO AIRPORT – DAY

The Protagonist and Neil walk through the terminal.

NEIL

Vault doors are fireproof, hydraulic closers, simple key and electronic triggers. Surprisingly easy, once there’s a lockdown.

PROTAGONIST

Why a lockdown?

NEIL

Power switches to fail-safe, sealing outer doors, but inner doors revert to factory settings and pickable locks. Child’s play, really.

PROTAGONIST
Child’s play? They’re inside
airport security. They have to
worry about climate control, not
armed raids.

NEIL

So how do we get fire power through the perimeter to trigger a lockdown?
 
40.


EXT. CROWDED AIRPORT BUS, OSLO AIRPORT – DAY

The Protagonist and Neil look across the tarmac to the freeport structure.

NEIL

Back wall of the freeport...

The Protagonist notices Neil start to smile...

PROTAGONIST

You’ve got something?

NEIL

You’re not going to like it.


EXT. OSLO STREET – DAY

The Protagonist looks at Neil in disbelief.

PROTAGONIST

You want to crash a plane?

NEIL

Not from the air, don’t be so dramatic. I want to run a jet off the taxiway, breach the rear wall, start a fire.

PROTAGONIST

How big a plane?

NEIL
Well, that part is a little
dramatic.

They approach a MAN sitting on a harbour-front bench.

NEIL (CONT'D)

This is Mahir. His team will work the plane.

PROTAGONIST

There can’t be passengers –

MAHIR

Norskfreight. They use the hangar on the west side of the freeport.

PROTAGONIST
You want to crash a transport
plane? What about the crew?

MAHIR
We’ll pop the slides, chuck ’em off
–
 
41.


PROTAGONIST

On the move?

MAHIR
What’s the problem? They’ll be
fine.

PROTAGONIST

It seems... bold.

MAHIR
(smiles)
‘Bold’ I’m fine with – I thought
you were going to say nuts.

PROTAGONIST

And if you get caught?

MAHIR

We won’t.

PROTAGONIST

If you do?

MAHIR

Everyone assumes terrorism, but no one’s died. Swift extradition, then lost in the system. It’ll barely make the news.

NEIL

That may depend on the size of your explosion.

MAHIR

Actually, the gold bars might get some play.

PROTAGONIST

Gold bars?

NEIL
Norskfreight ships treasury gold
once a month.

MAHIR

We blow the back, drop the gold out on the runway.

NEIL
No one’s going to be looking at
your building, I guarantee you.


INT. HOTEL ROOM, OSLO – DAY

Neil takes LUNGFULS of air, hyperventilating – Mahir starts a stopwatch. The Protagonist studies some plans...
 
42.


PROTAGONIST
The space at the centre of the
pentagon’s too big... there’s
something there, not marked.

Neil runs out of air. Mahir checks his watch.

NEIL

A vault within a vault?

PROTAGONIST

Maybe.

MAHIR

Eighty-five seconds.

NEIL

Ample.

MAHIR
Won’t you be running?
(turns to the
Protagonist)
Start packing.

The Protagonist starts BREATHING HARD...


EXT. FREEPORT – NIGHT

The Protagonist and Neil, carrying BRIEFCASES, head inside.


EXT. APRON, OSLO AIRPORT – CONTINUOUS

Two WORKERS (Mahir and his associate, ROHAN) back up a MEAL TRUCK to a TRANSPORT PLANE. They LIFT the cargo until it is level with the front side door...


INT. FREEPORT – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist follows Neil through security. Their

briefcases are examined, finding FRAMED DOCUMENTS...


INT. TRANSPORT PLANE – CONTINUOUS

Mahir and Rohan carry crew meals through the door and into the galley, where they stack them into the catering units, supervised by a GUARD...


INT. GALLERY SPACE/LOUNGE, FREEPORT – CONTINUOUS

The Staff Member brings Neil an espresso. The Protagonist subtly checks his watch...
 
43.


INT. TRANSPORT PLANE – CONTINUOUS

Mahir points past the Guard –

MAHIR

You gonna eat that?

The Guard turns – Mahir GRABS him from behind, Rohan stuffs a COTTON PAD over the Guard’s face, rendering him unconscious. They ROLL him into the catering-truck lift... Mahir pops out and signals ANOTHER GUARD...

THREE GUARDS have been dumped into the truck lift – Rohan sends it DOWN, SEALS the plane door. Mahir approaches the cockpit as the PILOTS perform checks – SHOWS THEM HIS GUN...

MAHIR (CONT'D)

Alright, lads?


INT. CORRIDOR, FREEPORT – CONTINUOUS

The Staff Member leads Neil and the Protagonist into the vaults...


INT. TRANSPORT PLANE – CONTINUOUS

At gunpoint, the Pilots nervously pull back from the hangar.

Rohan checks the stacks of GOLD BARS secured in the rear.


EXT. APRON, OSLO AIRPORT – CONTINUOUS

The plane is TOWED back onto the taxiway and lifts its engines, easing forward...


INT. TRANSPORT PLANE – CONTINUOUS

Rohan SLASHES the restraining straps – CROUCHES behind the pile of gold – pulls out a GRENADE – GRABS the nearest gold bar and STUFFS it into his waistband before PULLING THE PIN...


INT. VAULTS, FREEPORT – CONTINUOUS

The Staff Member shows Neil and the Protagonist into a vault. Neil puts down his briefcase – pulls out the framed documents.


EXT. TAXIWAY, OSLO AIRPORT – CONTINUOUS

The transport plane BARRELS down the taxiway...
 
44.


INT. TRANSPORT PLANE – CONTINUOUS

Rohan TOSSES the grenade behind the gold at the tail of the plane and DUCKS as it BLOWS –


EXT. TAXIWAY, OSLO AIRPORT – CONTINUOUS

BLASTING a hole in the rear of the plane... GOLD BARS POUR OUT, CLATTERING ACROSS THE TARMAC...


INT. VAULTS, FREEPORT – CONTINUOUS

Hearing the distant explosion, the Protagonist and Neil start PACKING AIR... the Staff Member stares at them, quizzical –

NEIL
(between breaths)
Yoga.


INT. COCKPIT, TRANSPORT PLANE – CONTINUOUS

Mahir forces the Pilots from their seats –


EXT. TAXIWAY, OSLO AIRPORT – CONTINUOUS

The INFLATABLE SLIDE BURSTS OPEN, DRAGGING on the asphalt, as the Pilots roll onto it, SCRAMBLING DOWN to the ground, ROLLING AWAY from the giant plane...


INT. COCKPIT, TRANSPORT PLANE – CONTINUOUS

Mahir TURNS the stick HARD LEFT, AIMING AT THE REAR WALL OF THE FREEPORT –


INT. TRANSPORT PLANE – CONTINUOUS

Rohan lowers a ladder behind the forward landing gear – he and Mahir climb down –


EXT. TAXIWAY, OSLO AIRPORT – CONTINUOUS

Mahir and Rohan jump down onto the asphalt, racing back between the wheels as the giant plane SMASHES INTO THE BRICK WALL OF THE FREEPORT, ERUPTING IN A MASSIVE EXPLOSION...


INT. VAULTS, FREEPORT – CONTINUOUS

The vault is ROCKED by the explosion – ALARMS SCREAM – DOORS START CLOSING – Neil looks, panicked, at the Staff Member –
 
45.


NEIL

Ten seconds, right?!

The Staff Member BOLTS – PUSHING PAST THEM – they take a last gulp of air – GAS HISSES IN. They pull apart the frames of the documents, BREAKING THEM INTO LOCK-PICKING APPARATUS – lockpicks, small crowbar – they go to work on the INNER DOOR, PRYING open a panel – HOT-WIRING it – the door SLIDES UP –


INT. CORRIDOR, FREEPORT – CONTINUOUS

They BURST into the corridor, GASPING – the door SLAMS DOWN behind them – they HUSTLE down to the next vault door – get to work. The door opens, they GULP AIR, then RACE inside –


INT. VAULT 2, FREEPORT – CONTINUOUS

– round the corner past RACKS, CRATES, some BROKEN – stop at the next door, the Protagonist picks the lock – his PICK BREAKS – Neil BOLTS back to where they entered – the Protagonist STRUGGLES, pulling out pieces of the pick – Neil gets to the first door –

NO HANDLE – the Protagonist uses a different tool – Neil SMASHES the door, full-blown PANIC – he looks to the end of the vault where the ROLLER DOOR is BROKEN at the bottom, halide gas HISSING OUT –

Neil races towards it – the Protagonist gets his door OPEN – Neil STUMBLES past – the Protagonist DRAGS him through the door –


INT. INNER CORRIDOR – CONTINUOUS

They lie GASPING. Neil hears something, looks around –

NEIL
(urgent whisper)
There’s someone in here with us!

The Protagonist is up, moving down the corridor...

They arrive at two doors, side by side: the Rotas vault. They each work on a door. Neil’s OPENS –

NEIL (CONT'D)

Need a hand?

The Protagonist works his door... nothing.

PROTAGONIST

Actually, yes.

Neil leans over, hits ‘ENTER’, the door OPENS.
 
46.


INT. ROTAS VAULT – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist enters a room, one side of which is a LONG GLASS WINDOW. Neil is on the other side of the glass, in an IDENTICAL ROOM. There are BULLET HOLES in the glass. At the end of each room is a tube, like a sealed in REVOLVING DOOR. The Protagonist’s feet crunch BROKEN GLASS...

Neil examines BULLET HOLES in the wall opposite the glass. WISPS of SMOKE gather near the holes – Neil reaches up –

PROTAGONIST

Don’t touch them –

NEIL

What the hell happened here?

The Protagonist sees a STRIPPED AUTOMATIC PISTOL on the floor. He picks it up, thinking –

PROTAGONIST

It hasn’t happened, yet.

Neil looks at the Protagonist, quizzical – A LOUD HUM STARTS UP from the revolving door... the Protagonist looks down – MOVEMENT beneath his feet – the DEBRIS – SMOKE GATHERS – the revolving doors ROTATE, OPENING – a BLACK-CLAD FIGURE in a GAS MASK LEAPS BACKWARDS from the tube – reaching behind itself to GRAB the stripped automatic in the Protagonist’s hand –

On Neil’s side an identical BLACK-CLAD FIGURE LEAPS out FORWARDS – knocks Neil over, moving for the vault door –

A SLIDE jumps into the Backwards Figure’s hand – he REASSEMBLES the gun in the Protagonist’s hand – a MAGAZINE jumping up to LOAD IT – BLAM!

A bullet is SUCKED OUT OF THE WALL – THROUGH THE GLASS – ‘HEALING’ THE BULLET HOLES – the Protagonist STRUGGLES with the Backwards Figure – whose REVERSE MOVEMENTS seem ALIEN and IMPOSSIBLE –

Neil gives chase – RACING out of the vault door –

The Backwards Figure pulls the Protagonist sideways, lining up his head with the next bullet hole – BLAM! GLASS FLIES UP as the shot JUST MISSES the Protagonist’s head –


INT. CORRIDOR, FREEPORT – CONTINUOUS

Neil CHASES the Forwards Figure down the corridor –
 
47.


INT. ROTAS VAULT – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist STRUGGLES – the Backwards Figure PUSHES him towards the next bullet hole, STRANGE REVERSE GROANING building in its throat, behind the black gas mask, the GROAN PEAKING AS the Protagonist takes his PICK and STABS the Backwards Figure in the arm and SMACKS the Figure’s gun out of its hand – it BOUNCES out the door –

The Figure RISES into the Protagonist’s arms – PULLS him backwards – we can’t tell if it’s PUSHING or the Protagonist is PULLING as they move backwards through the door –


INT. CORRIDOR, VAULT – CONTINUOUS

The Figure PUSHES/PULLS the Protagonist down the corridor –


INT. CORRIDOR, FREEPORT – CONTINUOUS

Neil RACES around a corner, GRABS the Figure’s MASK, which COMES OFF – he looks, SURPRISED, at the Figure’s face, WHICH WE CANNOT SEE, then TURNS, RACING back the way he came...


INT. CORRIDOR, FREEPORT – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist and the Backwards Figure struggle into –


INT. VAULT 2, FREEPORT – CONTINUOUS

They SMASH into the racks and crates – the Protagonist GRABS the gun – raises it to the Figure’s head –

NEIL (O.S.)

NO! Don’t kill him!

The Protagonist freezes – Neil steps up, DESPERATE –

NEIL (CONT'D)
We need to know if you’re
compromised.

The Protagonist THROWS the Figure to the ground –

PROTAGONIST

Why are you here?!

The Protagonist tries to rip off the gas mask, but it is strapped tight – the REVERSE KEENING gets LOUDER and LOUDER. The Protagonist STEPS onto the Figure’s injured arm...

PROTAGONIST (CONT'D)

Who sent you?!
 
48.


The Figure’s reverse screaming gets louder – the Protagonist KICKS its arm, HARD, AGAIN AND AGAIN –

PROTAGONIST (CONT'D)

HOW DID YOU KNOW WE’D BE HERE!

A BOOM! from outside – AIR starts BLOWING ACROSS the Backwards Figure, SUCKING underneath the broken roller door – the Backwards Figure SLIDES impossibly across the floor and underneath the door which SLAMS shut, unbroken behind him.

The Protagonist and Neil look at each other...

NEIL

We have to go.


EXT. APRON, OSLO AIRPORT – CONTINUOUS

One of the plane’s JET ENGINES has come loose, STILL THRUSTING, SWINGING AROUND, wreaking HAVOC for the EMERGENCY SERVICES – an AMBULANCE SKIDS SIDEWAYS, avoiding the THRUST...

Mahir and Rohan stand at a distance, watching the MAYHEM along with DOZENS of other UNIFORMED AIRPORT WORKERS...

INT./EXT. FREEPORT – CONTINUOUS

EMTS race in past the Staff Member...


INT. VAULTS, FREEPORT – CONTINUOUS

Neil moves to the other door – works the lock – SIRENS sound –

PROTAGONIST

What happened to the other guy?

NEIL

I took care of him.

The door opens – they slip into the outer vault –


INT. OUTER VAULT, FREEPORT – MOMENTS LATER

They reassemble the document frames, then LIE DOWN, ‘unconscious’ – EMERGENCY SERVICES BURSTS IN...

INT. HOTEL ROOM, OSLO – DAWN

Neil hangs up his phone –
 
49.


NEIL
Mahir and Rohan slipped out clean.
(turns to the
Protagonist)
I’ve seen too much and I’m still alive. Which means you’ve decided to trust me.

PROTAGONIST

Or I’ve lost my edge.

NEIL

Oh, your edge is intact.

The Protagonist looks at Neil.

PROTAGONIST

There’s a cold war.

NEIL

Nuclear?

PROTAGONIST

Temporal.

NEIL
(skeptical)
Time travel?

PROTAGONIST

No. Technology that can invert an object’s entropy.

NEIL

You mean reverse chronology. Like Feynman and Wheeler’s notion that a positron is an electron moving backwards in time.

PROTAGONIST

Sure, that’s exactly what I meant.

NEIL

I’ve a master’s in physics.

PROTAGONIST

Well, try to keep up.

NEIL

The implications of this are –

PROTAGONIST

Beyond secret.

NEIL

Then why’d you take me in?
 
50.


PROTAGONIST

I thought we’d find the drawing and a couple boxes of bullets.

NEIL

You were as surprised as I was.

PROTAGONIST

I’m going back to Mumbai for answers. I’ll set you up as go-between. But remember – to you, all this is about plutonium. Or when we’re done, they’ll kill you.

NEIL

Won’t you have to anyway?

PROTAGONIST

I’d rather it was my decision.

NEIL

So would I. I think.


INT./EXT. FERRY BOAT, MUMBAI – DAY

The Protagonist boards, approaching Priya at the rail.

PRIYA

I don’t like to leave my house.

PROTAGONIST
And I don’t like bungee jumping.
But we need to talk.

PRIYA

What about?

PROTAGONIST

Inversion.

PRIYA

We spoke about it –

PROTAGONIST
I don’t remember anything about
people being inverted –

PRIYA

We’re trying to do with inversion what we couldn’t do with the atomic bomb – uninvent it. Divide and contain the knowledge. Ignorance is our ammunition – the more any one of us knows, the greater the risk that we’re actually making the situation worse.
 
51.


PROTAGONIST

Risk more.

Priya gestures at the paper. A headline: ‘OSLO GOLD FREIGHT CRASH – TERRORISM? ROBBERY? BOTH?’

PRIYA

Your work?

The Protagonist nods.

PRIYA (CONT'D)

What did you find in the vaults?

PROTAGONIST

Two antagonists, one inverted. We took out the regular one, the inverted one got away.

PRIYA

Both emerged at the same moment?

PROTAGONIST

Yeah.

PRIYA

They were the same person. You saw someone re-inverting. Sator’s built a turnstile in that vault.

PROTAGONIST

Turnstile?

PRIYA

A machine for inverting.

PROTAGONIST

You told me the technology hasn’t been invented, yet.

PRIYA
It hasn’t. He’s been given it by
the future.

PROTAGONIST

For what?

PRIYA

You’ve the best chance of finding out.


EXT. MUMBAI STREET – MOMENTS LATER

They walk, BODYGUARDS at a discreet distance.

PRIYA

Have you met him?
 
52.


PROTAGONIST

I was close.

PRIYA

Get closer.

PROTAGONIST

I’ve been compromised. Unless that antagonist was a coincidence.

PRIYA

The wife set you up?

PROTAGONIST

Maybe. There’s a good chance I get killed as soon as I go back in.

PRIYA

This was always a suicide mission – that’s why they recruited a corpse.

PROTAGONIST

Who did? Who are we working for?

PRIYA

Everyone. Survival. You need more, consider yourself working for me.

PROTAGONIST
Well, Boss, I need a way to
succeed.

Priya thinks. Looks at the Protagonist. Deciding.

PRIYA
What if you have something he
needs?

PROTAGONIST

Such as?

PRIYA

Plutonium 241. Sator tried to lift the only loose 241 from under a CIA team at the opera siege in Kiev. He got the team, but not the 241.

PROTAGONIST

Who did?

PRIYA

Ukrainian security services. It’s moving through Tallinn in a week.
 
53.


PROTAGONIST
Helping an arms dealer steal
weapons-grade plutonium is
unacceptable. I’m just gonna take
him out.

PRIYA

No. Sator has to stay alive until we know his part in things. Leverage the situation without losing control of the 241.

PROTAGONIST

It’s too dangerous.

PRIYA

A terrorist bomb, even one that kills millions, is nothing compared with what happens if we don’t stop Sator.

PROTAGONIST

From. Doing. What?

Priya looks up the road at the cars STREAMING past...

PRIYA
We’re being attacked. Not by
terrorists or rogue states...

PROTAGONIST

Who, then?

PRIYA
We’re being attacked by the future.
And we’re fighting over time.

PROTAGONIST

Time?

PRIYA

Theirs is running out, so they’re coming for ours. And Sator is helping. You have to find out how.


EXT. TERRACE, AMALFI COAST – DAY

The Protagonist leaves the tourists behind, heading down a leafy path to emerge at a terrace overlooking the sea. Kat stands there, alone. The Protagonist falls in beside her.

KAT
I saw the news from Oslo. Do you
have the drawing?
 
54.


PROTAGONIST
You don’t have to worry about it
any more.

KAT

You destroyed it?

PROTAGONIST

I didn’t think you’d want it back.

KAT

Does he know?

PROTAGONIST

Not yet, so sit tight.

KAT

Sit tight? Why? Every day my son spends with that monster, he thinks a little less of me.

PROTAGONIST

It won’t be long. In the meantime, introduce me.

KAT

As what?

PROTAGONIST

I’m a former First Secretary from the American Embassy in Riyadh, we met at a party last June –

KAT

We were at a party in Riyadh, but I don’t think it was June –

PROTAGONIST

June 29th. 7 for 7:30, salmon on the printed menu swapped for sea bass on the night. Sator left early, that’s when we met. Don’t offer any of this, it’s there if he asks. I came into Shipley’s in London, you ran into me here and want to show me the yacht.

KAT

He’ll think we’re having an affair.

PROTAGONIST

And he’ll want to meet me.

KAT

Or have you killed.

PROTAGONIST

Let me worry about that.
 
55.


KAT

Did I look worried?


EXT. DOCK, AMALFI – DAY

The Protagonist and Kat look out at an enormous yacht.

KAT

Sleeps 70, with crew. Four tenders, two helicopters, missile defences –

PROTAGONIST

Jesus. Worried about pirates?

KAT

Andrei loves playing one government off another. The day they turn, that’s his refuge.

PROTAGONIST

What if I joined you?

She nods at Volkov, holding the launch’s line.

KAT
I’m not sure Volkov’s taking
passengers just now.

PROTAGONIST

Then let’s take mine.

The Protagonist nods at Volkov as they walk past.


EXT. HARBOUR, AMALFI – MOMENTS LATER

The Protagonist GUNS his boat hard, carving a GLITTERING PATH across the calm harbour. Kat sits, enjoying the speed.

The Protagonist pulls up alongside the yacht, CREW MEMBERS SCRAMBLE, unaccustomed to unauthorized approaches. The Protagonist follows Kat’s gaze to a FIGURE above, but the sun is behind it. Kat steps onto the yacht.

The Protagonist gives the figure a JAUNTY SALUTE. No response. The Protagonist ZIPS back towards shore, passing the yacht’s launch. He waves at Volkov.


INT./EXT. YACHT – MOMENTS LATER

Follow Kat into the enormous lounge. She drops her bags –

MALE VOICE (O.S.)

Who’s the American?
 
56.


She turns. A middle-aged man with cold eyes and a thin beard stands in the doorway. THIS IS SATOR.

KAT

A friend.

SATOR

The man from Shipley’s?

KAT

Who you tried to have beaten up?

SATOR

I ask again. Who is he?

KAT
We met in Riyadh. In June at the
American Embassy.

SATOR

Good with fists for a diplomat...

KAT
Paranoia’s your department. He
seems nice, I invited him to the
dinner.
(turns away)
Max?... Max?!...

SATOR
He’s visiting Pompeii and
Herculaneum.

KAT

Overnight? You just sent him off?!

SATOR

He’s my son.

KAT
Our son. I told him I’d go with him
–

SATOR
I explained you were busy. With
your friend.

He turns, walks away. She watches him leave.


INT. RESTAURANT, AMALFI COAST – EVENING

The Protagonist walks towards a table where Sator, holding court, attacks some crabs. Volkov stops the Protagonist and FRISKS him, in full view of the diners.
 
57.


PROTAGONIST

Where I’m from, you buy me dinner first.

Without looking, Sator gestures at a seat, Volkov lets the Protagonist pass. He sits.

PROTAGONIST (CONT'D)

Mr Sator? I’m –

SATOR
(quiet)
Don’t bother. Just tell me if
you’ve slept with my wife, yet.

The Protagonist glances up at Kat, opposite, chatting.

PROTAGONIST

No. Not yet.

A glance from Sator between buttery mouthfuls of crab.

SATOR

How would you like to die?

PROTAGONIST

Old.

SATOR

You chose the wrong profession.

Sator returns a toast from a grinning guest. Reaches a greasy palm to the Protagonist’s cheek, as if in friendliness...

SATOR (CONT'D)
There’s a walled garden up the
road. We’re going to take you
there, cut your throat, not across,
in the middle, like a hole. Then we
take your balls, stuff them in the
cut, block the windpipe.

PROTAGONIST

Complex.

SATOR

It’s gratifying to watch a man you don’t like try to pull his own balls out of his throat before he chokes.

PROTAGONIST
Is this how you treat all your
guests?

SATOR

The ones using my family to get to me.
 
58.


PROTAGONIST

How else is someone supposed to get to you?

SATOR

Only a fool wants to be near me.

PROTAGONIST

Or someone who has something worth delaying your gratification for...

Sator signals Volkov – Kat glances over as Volkov RISES –

SATOR

We’re finished.

PROTAGONIST

Do you like opera?

At this, Sator pauses. Waves off Volkov.

SATOR

Not here. You sail?

PROTAGONIST

I’ve messed around on boats.

SATOR

Be on the dock at eight. Ready to do more than mess around.

Kat, relieved, watches the Protagonist leave.


EXT. DINING ROOM, YACHT – MORNING

Kat enters, dressed in sailing gear. Sator is already seated, similarly dressed, reading his phone, with a cup of coffee.

KAT

Max has missed too much school this year. I’m taking him back to England.

SATOR
No, you’re not. He has a tutor
here.

KAT

The school won’t be okay with –

SATOR

Yes, they will.

KAT

Can I finish?!
 
59.


SATOR

Look around you – he has everything he needs here.

A SERVANT places a plate with a silver cover in front of Kat, then pours her coffee.

KAT

You don’t care what he needs. You bought the trappings of a king, but we both know you’re a grubby little man playing power games with a wife who doesn’t love him any more.

Sator looks at her.

SATOR

You seem spirited today.

KAT
(defiant)
Do I?

Sator barely nods at the servant, who pulls off the lid...

SATOR

Yes. You do.

On the plate, instead of breakfast, is a small drawing. A ‘Rubens’. Kat freezes.

SATOR (CONT'D)
Were you worried it had been
destroyed? Rest assured, instinct
told me to remove it from the
vault. I’ve always had instincts
about the future. That’s how I
built this life you no longer
value.

Kat looks up at him, not knowing what to say or do.


EXT. DOCK, AMALFI – MORNING

The Protagonist stands on the dock, dressed for sailing, watching the launch approach...

PROTAGONIST

Morning.

As he gets on, Kat ignores him. Sator enjoys this.


EXT. OPEN OCEAN, AMALFI – MOMENTS LATER

The Protagonist tries to catch Kat’s eye, but she will not look his way.
 
60.


Sator hands the Protagonist a HARNESS and a HELMET... he looks at them, taken aback, then looks ahead – towards TWO GRAPHITE DARK, HIGHEST TECH AMERICA’S CUP SAILING YACHTS, trimmed and ready.

PROTAGONIST
(impressed)
When you said sailing...


EXT. SAILING YACHT DECK – MOMENTS LATER

Kat gets on, followed by Sator and the Protagonist. The rigging crew departs. Kat checks the sheets and winches. Sator indicates the harness.

SATOR

You know how?

PROTAGONIST

Aye, Captain.

Sator gestures at Kat.

SATOR

She’s captain.


EXT. OPEN OCEAN, AMALFI – LATER

The boats FLY, SKIMMING THE WATER ON THEIR HYDROFOILS... Sator and the Protagonist are next to each other, standing on one pontoon, LEANING OUT IN THEIR HARNESSES... Kat is at the wheel, concentrating...

SATOR

What do you know about opera?

PROTAGONIST

In 2008 a remote Russian missile station was overwhelmed and held for a week. When the station was retaken, the plutonium 241 on one warhead was three quarters of a kilo lighter. The missing 241 surfaced at the opera-house siege in Kiev on the 14th.

SATOR
You’re well informed. But that
doesn’t mean you have the
plutonium.

PROTAGONIST

I didn’t say I had it. I’m saying I know how to get it –
 
61.


KAT (O.S.)

COMING ABOUT!

Kat SWINGS the boat into the wind, SAIL FLAPPING FURIOUSLY as the wind catches it on the other side, and Sator and the Protagonist DUCK under the boom, RACING to the other side, their harnesses SNAPPING TAUT as they lean out...

SATOR

What do you propose?

PROTAGONIST

Partnership.

SATOR

I wouldn’t partner with you.

Kat works the wheel, tracking the other boat. Her look is one of BOTTLED RAGE...

PROTAGONIST

What’s wrong with me?

SATOR
You know how to handle yourself,
you have no record.

PROTAGONIST
Someone in the arms trade with
training who covers his tracks? Not
that shocking.

SATOR

For an intelligence agent.

Sator holds the Protagonist’s gaze...

KAT

Secure your jib line.

The Protagonist turns – Kat leans in to Sator –

KAT (CONT'D)

Burn in hell, Andrei –

– and YANKS HIS QUICK-RELEASE – he FLIES off the boat, SMASHING HEAD-FIRST into the waves –

The Protagonist sees Sator FACE-DOWN, UNCONSCIOUS – he UNCLIPS, JUMPS to the wheel, SPINNING the boat OFF THE WIND –

KAT (CONT'D)

YOU CAN’T JIBE A BOAT LIKE THIS – !

The Protagonist STEERS the boat across the wind, SNAPPING THE BOOM ACROSS, ALMOST LOSING THE MAST –
 
62.


PROTAGONIST

You can if you have to –

He RELEASES THE SHEETS, SPILLING WIND, LOSING SPEED – as they pass Sator he DIVES into the water – GRABS the oligarch – PULLS his face out of the water... Sator starts COUGHING...


INT. STATEROOM, SATOR’S YACHT – DAY

The Protagonist dries himself – the door opens – Kat BURSTS in –

KAT

WHY DIDN’T YOU LET HIM DROWN?!

She is on him, smashing her fists into his chest –

PROTAGONIST

I need him.

KAT

To sell guns?!

PROTAGONIST

I’m not who you think I am.

KAT
That, I know – he showed me the
drawing.

PROTAGONIST

I’m sorry.

KAT
Do you have any idea what you’ve
done?

PROTAGONIST

I had to get close to him. I don’t know what you think your husband is –

KAT

We both know he’s an arms dealer.

PROTAGONIST

He’s so much more.

KAT

What, then?

PROTAGONIST

Andrei Sator holds all our lives in his hands. Not just yours.

She looks bemused. A KNOCK at the door – she hides behind it –
 
63.


VOLKOV

Mr Sator wants to see you.

The Protagonist nods – pushes the door – Volkov stops it –

VOLKOV (CONT'D)

Now.

PROTAGONIST

He wants to see me without pants?

Volkov lets the door shut. The Protagonist turns to Kat –

PROTAGONIST (CONT'D)

Trust me.

KAT
Save it. I’m not falling for it
twice.

The Protagonist looks at Kat. Sighs.

PROTAGONIST

You have a better option?

She looks into the Protagonist’s eyes. Assessing.

KAT

Whatever it takes to get what you want. Just like him. Not a second’s thought about me. My son. What do you think he’s going to do to me now?

He pulls a gun from his bag. Offers it to her.

PROTAGONIST

Try not to use this –

She takes it – lets it point at him.

PROTAGONIST (CONT'D)

On anyone.


INT. STUDY, SATOR’S YACHT – EVENING

The Protagonist is shown in. Sator is sitting behind his desk. A DOCTOR is taking his blood pressure.

SATOR

Enough –

Sator RIPS the cuff off his arm, sending the doctor out – checks a fitness tracker on his wrist.
 
64.


SATOR (CONT'D)
See? Pulse of a man half my age.
Drink with me.

Sator pours them both tumblers of vodka.

SATOR (CONT'D)

It seems I now owe you my life.

PROTAGONIST

It’s nothing.

Sator fixes his black gaze on the Protagonist.

SATOR

My life is not nothing. And I don’t like to be in debt.

PROTAGONIST

Then pay me. No retribution against your wife.

A dangerous beat. Then Sator GRINS –

SATOR
You think she released my harness?
(laughs)
It was my own mistake.

PROTAGONIST

Then help me steal the 241. I need resources. It’s weapons-grade plutonium – that means special handling, containment facilities –

SATOR

I know what it means. You lecture me about radiation. Andrei Sator, digging plutonium from the rubble of my city as a teenager?

PROTAGONIST

Where?

SATOR

Stalsk-12. My home.

Sator sips his drink. Looks the Protagonist in the eye.

SATOR (CONT'D)

One pod of a warhead exploded at ground level, scattering the others. They needed people to find the plutonium...
 
65.


INSERT CUT: IN A DESOLATE STREET, SNOW FALLS ON A HAZMAT-SUITED SCAVENGER – A YOUNG SATOR WALKING IN FRONT OF A MASSIVE MINING MACHINE, CARRYING A GIANT CROWBAR AND A GEIGER COUNTER...

SATOR (CONT'D)

It became my first contract – nobody else even bid. They thought it was a death sentence.

INSERT CUT: YOUNG SATOR SPOTS THE MACHINE UNEARTHING A LARGE METAL CAPSULE. A FELLOW WORKER SEES THE SAME THING...

SATOR (CONT'D)

But one man’s probability of death is another man’s possibility for a life...

INSERT CUT: YOUNG SATOR OPENS THE CAPSULE. HE LIFTS OUT SOME PAPERS, WHICH HAVE HIS NAME ON THEM, REVEALING GOLD BARS UNDERNEATH. THE FELLOW WORKER LEANS IN, STUDYING THE GOLD. THEY MAKE EYE CONTACT... SATOR STRIKES THE FELLOW WORKER WITH HIS CROWBAR, KILLING HIM...

SATOR (CONT'D)

I staked my claim in the new Russia. Even now, my company is the only one to operate in the ruins.

PROTAGONIST

The 241’s being transported through Northern Europe on its way to the long-term nuclear storage depot at Trieste. I’m told you have resources in Tallinn.

Sator downs his vodka.

SATOR

Stay with us tonight. I insist.


INT. KAT’S STATEROOM, SATOR’S YACHT – NIGHT

Kat slips the gun under her mattress, feels the lump – pulls it out – moves to the desk, puts it in her jewellery case – hearing a noise she jumps onto the bed, picks up a book. The door opens. Sator. He locks the door.

KAT

What do you want, Andrei?

SATOR

We’re going to talk about today.

KAT

No, we’re not.
 
66.


He removes a DIAMOND CUFFLINK...

SATOR

No?

Kat starts to get off the bed –

KAT
Don’t think for a minute you can
treat me the way you treat your
other women.

Sator shifts to lean on the desk, cutting her off from the jewellery box. She sits back down. He removes his belt...

SATOR
And how do you imagine I treat
these other women?

Sator slips the cufflink through a belt hole...

SATOR (CONT'D)
You think I force them into
conversation?

Sator tests the diamond studded belt against his palm.

SATOR (CONT'D)

You want to be quiet? Fine...

He tosses her a pillow.

SATOR (CONT'D)

Bite down on that...

Sator moves towards her – she looks at the jewellery box on the desk – no way around him – Sator looks down at her. She looks up at his cold eyes...

KAT

Even a soul as blank and brittle as yours needs a response. Is fear and pain enough? Because that’s all I have to offer.

SATOR

Then it’ll have to do.

KAT

Why didn’t you just throw me out?

SATOR

If I can’t have you, no one can.

KAT
At what point do you give up and
kill me?
 
67.


Sator shrugs, wraps the belt a turn around his fist...

SATOR

Turn over.

KAT
Touch me, I scream so loud he
hears.

SATOR

You think I’d let him interfere?

KAT

If he tried you’d have to kill him. End of deal. So leave me the fuck alone.
