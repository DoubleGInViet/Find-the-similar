A KNOCK at the door.

SATOR

NOT NOW!

But he hears a RUMBLING... Sator, without a word, exits –


EXT. SATOR’S YACHT, AMALFI COAST – NIGHT

Sator GRABS binoculars from one of his men, peering out –

A helicopter EMERGES from the darkness, THUNDERING IN...


INT. GUEST STATEROOM, SATOR’S YACHT – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist listens to the incoming chopper – pulls on a black Windbreaker – quietly opens his door...


INT. PASSAGE, BELOW DECKS, SATOR’S YACHT – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist makes his way, looking for an exit...


EXT. SATOR’S YACHT, AMALFI COAST – CONTINUOUS

The chopper descends to the landing pad – rotors turning as Sator signals his men to head in...


EXT. SATOR’S YACHT – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist is on a roof overlooking the helipad...

He watches Sator’s men remove a LARGE, GRUBBY CAPSULE and take it below as the chopper LIFTS OFF...
 
68.


INT. STORAGE AREA, SATOR’S YACHT – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist makes his way through the storage area. Peering through a window, he sees –


INT. ENGINE ROOM, SATOR’S YACHT – CONTINUOUS

Crew gathered around the capsule. Sator enters, wipes dirt from the latches and opens it. Sator puts his hand over the open capsule, letting small, flat GOLD BARS leap from the capsule into his hand... he looks up, expectantly...

The Crew SHOVES a CREW MEMBER forwards, onto his knees... eyes downcast, he reaches behind – pulls a gold bar from his rear pocket. He offers it to Sator with TREMBLING hands.

Sator takes it, eyes never leaving the Crew Member... who finally, tentatively looks up –

BAM! Sator JABS him in the mouth with the gold bar, then SMASHES him over the head –


INT. STORAGE AREA, SATOR’S YACHT – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist is REPULSED by what he sees...


INT. ENGINE ROOM, SATOR’S YACHT – CONTINUOUS

Sator steps back, breathless, from the Small Crew Member, who lies motionless on the ground.

As Sator raises his wrist to check his fitness tracker, BLOOD drips from the gold bar in his hand.

SATOR
Ninety-eight. Not bad for such
exertion.


EXT. STORAGE AREA, SATOR’S YACHT – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist SENSES, TURNS – CRACK! Volkov smashes his jaw – KICKS him in the ribs – pistol-whips him...


INT. ENGINE ROOM, SATOR’S YACHT – MOMENTS LATER

The Protagonist, bleeding, is SHOVED into the room –

VOLKOV

He was at the window.

Sator looks at the Protagonist, who nods at the capsule –
 
69.


PROTAGONIST

I was curious.

SATOR

My property shouldn’t concern you. Who are you? How do you come by your information about the opera?

PROTAGONIST

Do I work for intelligence services? Several, just like you. You wouldn’t do business with someone who wasn’t savvy enough to be recruited. Hell, the CIA provides two-thirds of the market for fissile material.

SATOR
They’re usually buying, not
selling. But we do live in a
twilight world...

PROTAGONIST

Is that Whitman? It’s pretty.

SATOR
Next warning’s a bullet in your
brain.

PROTAGONIST

No balls in my throat?

SATOR

There’ll be no time for such things in Tallinn.

Sator gestures to his men – they lift the capsule. The Protagonist spots DRIED MUD from the latches on the table...

SATOR (CONT'D)

Make your way there. I want Volkov on the team.

The Protagonist struggles to his feet.

PROTAGONIST

No. I spring the materials, you pay me off. Your wife does the exchange.

SATOR

I never involve her in my business.

PROTAGONIST

That’s why I trust her.
 
70.


SATOR
(to Volkov)
Put him ashore.

PROTAGONIST

How do I contact you?

SATOR

You don’t.

PROTAGONIST

How do you advance me funds?

Sator TOSSES the Protagonist the BLOODY GOLD BAR – the Protagonist FUMBLES it onto the table. Volkov SNEERS –

SATOR
Handle the plutonium better than
that.

The Protagonist, looking Volkov in the eye, picks up the gold bar, scooping DRIED MUD into his hand, unseen.


EXT. DOWNTOWN STREETS, TALLINN – DAY

The Protagonist walks the crowded streets with Neil.

PROTAGONIST

What did you find on the gold?

NEIL

Three hundred thousand at today’s price, no franks, mould marks. Nothing. Like it came from outer space.

PROTAGONIST

Or the future.

NEIL

How?

PROTAGONIST

Dead drops. He buries his time capsule, transmits the location, then digs it up to collect whatever inverted material they’ve sent.

NEIL

Instantaneous. Where’s he bury it?

PROTAGONIST
Someplace that won’t be disturbed
for centuries. What did the soil
sample show?
 
71.


NEIL
Northern Europe or Asia,
radioactive. Dried blood was
European.

PROTAGONIST

Pretty broad.

NEIL

This is the start of the run.

The Protagonist looks back where they came. Then up ahead.

PROTAGONIST

When does the material arrive?

NEIL

Thursday. When does Sator arrive?

PROTAGONIST

I don’t know. But he’ll be here.

NEIL

Cargo’s in a reinforced truck. Nuclear police front and back – SUVs with serious armour – you can’t break in through the windows.

PROTAGONIST

And they can’t break out.

NEIL

I don’t follow.

PROTAGONIST

You will. So, light convoy through downtown, what’s the thinking?

NEIL
A crowded, unpredictable traffic
pattern makes planning an ambush
almost impossible.

The Protagonist looks around at the congestion.

PROTAGONIST
They have a point. Is the convoy
monitored from the air?

NEIL

No, tracked by GPS – a wrong turn or an unscheduled stop, in comes the cavalry.

Neil and the Protagonist hop a tram. The Protagonist studies the journey along the multi-lane road out of town.
 
72.


PROTAGONIST

We need big guns, guns that make the point without being fired. We need a fast car that doesn’t look fast and four heavy vehicles, all different – bus, coach, eighteen-wheeler...

Neil nods.

PROTAGONIST (CONT'D)

One of them has to be a fire truck.

Neil looks up, interested.

PROTAGONIST (CONT'D) Most of all, we need to set this up with nothing in the record – nothing electronic, nothing paper – I don’t want Sator ambushing us the second we spring the material. His ignorance is our only protection.


INT./EXT. MERCEDES ON TALLINN STREETS – DAY

Kat sits beside Sator in the back, staring out the window.

SATOR
Everything salvaged from Oslo’s
been shipped here.

KAT

Why am I here?

SATOR

I don’t trust anyone else to assess the pieces.


EXT. FREEPORT, DOCKSIDE AREA, EDGE OF TALLINN – DAY

The MERCEDES pulls into the Tallinn Freeport. Several BODYGUARDS emerge, Sator heads inside. Kat follows, looking through a metal fence – an AUDI sits there, idling. Its driver is wearing an OXYGEN MASK...


INT. STORAGE FACILITY, TALLINN FREEPORT – MOMENTS LATER

Kat enters. Sator is at a table covered in WEAPONS.

SATOR

See, Kat? Some of my favourites...

He picks up a MACHINE GUN.
 
73.


SATOR (CONT'D)
Singed but salvageable, wouldn’t
you say?

She stares at the weaponry as if she’s never seen anything like it before...

KAT

It’s not my area of expertise.

SATOR
That’s right. You’d never have
anything to do with such things.
But this is where our worlds
collide.

KAT

Andrei, what is this?

SATOR

You know perfectly well what it is, Kat – the filthy business that put those clothes on your back and our boy in his school. That you thought you could negotiate your way around.

VOLKOV
(in Russian, subtitled)
The convoy’s due downtown in ten.

Sator checks his watch. Nods at Volkov. Turns to Kat.

SATOR

It’s time to go.

KAT

I’m not going anywhere with you.

Sator SLAMS the machine gun back down on the table. Kat FLINCHES. Sator TURNS, enraged...

SATOR

Look at me and understand – you don’t negotiate with a tiger – you admire a tiger, until it turns on you and you feel its TRUE. FUCKING. NATURE!

Sator moves towards her – Kat pulls out a gun.

KAT

Don’t...
 
74.


EXT. TALLINN STREET – DAY

A LARGE UNMARKED TRUCK, with an ESCORT FRONT AND BACK, makes its stop and-start way through the downtown traffic.


INT./EXT. BMW, TALLINN STREET – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist and Neil watch the convoy cross an intersection, then pull forward, squeezing through traffic to get ahead. Neil raises a walkie-talkie –

YELLOW CO-PILOT
(into radio)
Green? Two minutes.


INT./EXT. GREEN TRUCK, TALLINN STREET – CONTINUOUS

The GREEN DRIVER nods at the GREEN CO-PILOT who holds the radio.

GREEN CO-PILOT

Check.

He puts the radio down and pulls out a LARGE AUTOMATIC RIFLE.


INT./EXT. BMW, TALLINN STREET – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist checks his watch – Neil speaks into the radio –

NEIL

Yellow? Sixty seconds.

YELLOW CO-PILOT
(over radio)
Sixty. Check.

NEIL

Blue? Forty-five seconds.

BLUE CO-PILOT
(over radio)
Forty-five. Check.

NEIL

Red? On our way to you.


INT./EXT. FIRE ENGINE – CONTINUOUS

RED DRIVER and RED CO-PILOT are dressed as FIREFIGHTERS.
 
75.


INT./EXT. BMW, TALLINN STREET – CONTINUOUS

The BMW pulls out, running behind the nuclear convoy. As the convoy passes the cross street where the green truck, a FLATBED TRUCK, is sitting, it pulls out beside them, settling in to the right of the convoy.


INT. STORAGE FACILITY – DAY

Sator steps towards Kat –

KAT

Stay right there!

She lifts the gun, intent –

SATOR

You wouldn’t kill me.

KAT

I already tried.

SATOR

You pushed me off a boat. You’re not going to shoot me in cold blood –

KAT

My blood’s not cold, Andrei.

SATOR

No, but you’re not angry enough.

Sator edges towards Kat...

SATOR (CONT'D)
Because anger scars over into
despair. I look in your eyes...

He casually GESTURES at her –

SATOR (CONT'D)

I see despair.

He SMACKS the gun out of her hands – PUNCHES her – she DROPS –

SATOR (CONT'D)
Vengeful bitch. Living off me,
pretending to be better...

With a primal, animal viciousness, Sator SPITS at Kat.

SATOR (CONT'D)

ENOUGH!

Sator KICKS her once, in the side.
 
76.


SATOR (CONT'D)

You wanted to know when it’s better to kill you? You’ll have your answer.

He motions to Volkov, who, with a guard, lifts Kat and carries her towards the door. Sator puts an earpiece in his ear...

SATOR (CONT'D)

Tell me everything as it happens.

Volkov nods, leaving – Sator walks through a large door.

SATOR (CONT'D)

Seal us this side!

As the door shuts behind him, he walks towards a RED DOOR WITH A SMALL PORTHOLE, finding a spot in the shadows nearby...


EXT. TALLINN STREET – CONTINUOUS

The BMW watches the yellow truck, a BROADCAST TRUCK, which pulls out just ahead of the nuclear convoy... the Protagonist looks back through the BMW’s side mirror, which is CRACKED...

The BMW sees the blue truck, a WRECKER, which pulls out onto the larger street, just behind the convoy, which is now SURROUNDED ON THREE SIDES by the coloured trucks.


INT. MERCEDES – CONTINUOUS

Volkov follows the convoy...

VOLKOV
(into radio)
Three trucks in place...

SATOR
(over radio)
Watch everything, give me all the details...


INT. STORAGE FACILITY, TALLINN FREEPORT – CONTINUOUS

Sator sits in the shadows, listening intently...


EXT. TALLINN STREETS – CONTINUOUS

The BMW ZIPS ahead, weaving through traffic, pulls alongside the fire truck.
 
77.


The Protagonist, DRESSED AS A FIREFIGHTER, jumps out of the BMW and grabs onto the side of the fire truck, BANGING the side to signal the driver. The fire truck pulls out onto the three-lane highway...


INT./EXT. FIRE TRUCK – CONTINUOUS

The fire truck pulls alongside the nuclear convoy, slotting in on the left, so that the convoy is now SURROUNDED... the Protagonist CLIMBS onto the roof beside the ladder, puts on a pair of heavy-duty gloves, pulls a diagonal backpack around onto his front, checking his tools.

Blue Co-pilot and Yellow Co-pilot COUNT DOWN in unison –

BLUE CO-PILOT
(over radio)
Five, four, three, two, one, go...

Blue truck, behind the convoy, GUNS THE ACCELERATOR, as yellow truck, in front of the convoy, SLAMS ON THE BRAKES...

The two SUVS are ACCORDIONED against the nuclear truck, then

CARRIED FORWARD WITH THE NUCLEAR TRUCK as the coloured trucks
CLOSE FORMATION and PULL FORWARD, maintaining pace –

BLUE CO-PILOT (CONT'D)

Go yellow!

The YELLOW CO-PILOT in the broadcast truck sends out STATIC –


INT./EXT. SECURITY SUV – CONTINUOUS

The SECURITY DRIVER is trying the radio – STATIC...


INT. CONTROL CENTRE, TALLINN POLICE – CONTINUOUS

A POLICE OPERATOR is frowning, trying the radio. He calls to his SUPERVISOR –

POLICE OPERATOR
(in Estonian, subtitled)
– Radio’s down. –

SUPERVISOR
(in Estonian, subtitled)
– Are they still moving? –

The Police Operator checks his screen – NODS...
 
78.


EXT. TALLINN STREET – CONTINUOUS

TYRES HOWLING, the convoy GRINDS forward – Blue Co-pilot tosses a DYE PACK onto the windshield of the SUV – it BLASTS across the glass, obscuring the view – Yellow Co-pilot does the same in the front – the Guards are now BLIND, CANNOT OPEN THEIR DOORS OR SHOOT OUT THROUGH THE BULLET-PROOF VEHICLES...

The Protagonist CLIMBS ONTO THE LADDER, lying on top...

Inside, the Red Co-pilot operates the ladder controls...

The ladder SWINGS OUT AT NINETY DEGREES, hanging the Protagonist DIRECTLY OVER THE NUCLEAR TRUCK... he PULLS a frame from his pack, unfolds it – fixes it to the roof. The ladder SWINGS him away – the frame EXPLODES – he SWINGS back through the smoke to find an OPENING and climbs into –


INT. NUCLEAR TRANSPORTATION TRUCK – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist lands, gets his bearings, finds the SAFE. He reaches into his pack...


EXT. TALLINN STREET – CONTINUOUS

An Estonian POLICE CAR pulls up behind the fire truck – the POLICEMEN spot SPARKS from the dragging bumper of the SUV – the Policeman Passenger tries his radio... STATIC...


INT. NUCLEAR TRANSPORTATION TRUCK – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist affixes a CHARGE to the safe – he runs a wire, pushing back into the farthest corner – BLASTS the door open –


INT./EXT. FIRE ENGINE – CONTINUOUS

Watching the Police through his mirror, Red Passenger rolls down his window and props his ASSAULT RIFLE on the sill...

INT. NUCLEAR TRANSPORTATION TRUCK – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist reaches into the safe... PULLS OUT an ORANGE PLASTIC CASE... reaches up to climb through the roof...

INT./EXT. FIRE TRUCK – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist, orange case in hand, CLIMBS onto the ladder

– Red Passenger SWINGS his rear-opening door out and SHOOTS OUT the engine block of the police car which DROPS BACK as –
 
79.


The fire-truck ladder SWINGS the Protagonist back onto the fire truck – he climbs down onto the side – the BMW pulls alongside – he JUMPS into the car, which SPEEDS away...


INT./EXT. BMW, TALLINN STREET – CONTINUOUS

Neil, driving, glances at the orange case –

NEIL

We got it!

The Protagonist opens the latches, flips open the lid...

revealing the BLACK METAL SHAPE the size of a softball.

PROTAGONIST

I’ve seen samples of encapsulation in every weapons class – this is not one of them.

Neil looks back at the Protagonist. Serious.

NEIL

It’s what he’s after.

The Protagonist looks around at the surrounding traffic...

PROTAGONIST

Check the radio chatter.

Neil clicks on the radio – EMPHATIC GIBBERISH...

NEIL

I can’t understand –

PROTAGONIST

You said you spoke Estonian –

NEIL
It’s not Estonian, it’s...
backwards –

Up ahead, an Audi is weaving through traffic, towards them, BACKWARDS... Neil STARES...

NEIL (CONT'D)

The hell?

The BACKWARDS-RUNNING AUDI flies at them, CLIPPING the wing mirror, ‘HEALING’ its crack. Behind them it SPINS AROUND, to CHASE them, still running BACKWARDS...

The BMW DODGES around traffic, trying to lose the backwards Audi, which pulls up to the back bumper – then ALONGSIDE – in the back is Sator, black eyes peering over a RESPIRATOR, a gun to Kat’s head. She is BOUND and GAGGED, eyes TERRIFIED –
 
80.


Sator rolls the rear window down, holds up his hand, FINGERS EXTENDED. He COCKS the gun at Kat’s head then starts COUNTING DOWN on his fingers... the Protagonist looks down at the BLACK METAL SHAPE in the case...

NEIL (CONT'D)

You can’t give it to him!

The Protagonist LIFTS the closed case, LOWERS the window...

PROTAGONIST

This isn’t plutonium.

Sator is down to TWO FINGERS... Ahead of them in the road, the Protagonist sees a CRASHED, SMOKING, UPSIDE-DOWN SAAB...

NEIL

It’s worse, goddammit!

Both cars race towards the crashed Saab, which starts SHAKING as they approach – as they pass, THE CRASHED SAAB ROLLS VIOLENTLY OVER AND OVER between them until it is on its wheels, RACING BACKWARDS ahead of them, UNDAMAGED –

Neil regains his line, looks over at Sator who holds up his LAST FINGER... the Protagonist looks ahead to the Saab, STRUCK BY AN IDEA... the Protagonist looks at Sator –

Then TOSSES the orange case at him –

The Saab brakes, CUTTING BETWEEN THE TWO CARS...

THE ORANGE CASE GLANCES OFF ITS WINDSHIELD, INTO SATOR’S HANDS...

A forwards-driving Mercedes pulls up alongside the backwards-driving Audi. Sator opens the rear door – he and the Audi driver climb BACKWARDS into the Mercedes – LEAVING KAT IN THE ACCELERATING BACKWARDS AUDI – the Mercedes DROPS FAR BEHIND the BMW, Neil WATCHES –

NEIL (CONT'D)

He’s getting away!

PROTAGONIST

He left her in the car!

Neil looks forward to the backwards Audi, SPEEDING AWAY –


INT./EXT. BACKWARDS AUDI – CONTINUOUS

NO ONE IS AT THE WHEEL as the car continues to accelerate – Kat lies in the back, breathing, groaning, but unconscious...
 
81.


INT./EXT. BMW, TALLINN STREET – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist stares ahead at the backwards Audi –

PROTAGONIST

Pull up alongside...

Neil looks back at the receding Mercedes, followed by the BACKWARDS SAAB... he turns – RACING to pull alongside the runaway backwards Audi, the Protagonist OPENS his door...

– Ahead, a LOGJAM of traffic...

The Protagonist FUMBLES to open the Audi door.

PROTAGONIST (CONT'D)

Kat! Kat!

In the back, Kat swings her bound legs around –

– The LOGJAM of cars and buses LOOMS CLOSER... The Protagonist OPENS the Audi door, but his own door hits it and
SLAMS IT CLOSED AGAIN...

– The LOGJAM is DANGEROUSLY CLOSE...

The Protagonist OPENS it again, Kat JAMS it open with her feet – the Protagonist CLIMBS ACROSS and PUSHES THE BRAKE WITH HIS HAND...

The Audi SKIDS to a halt, the BMW ZOOMING PAST...

The Protagonist starts to untie Kat, fumbling with his radio –

The BMW SKIDS to a halt, Neil JUMPS OUT – a CAR SKIDS to a halt between the BMW and the Audi – BLAM, BLAM! Neil DUCKS, avoiding GUNFIRE –

NEIL
(over radio)
Sit tight – I’m calling in the
cavalry.

PROTAGONIST

What cavalry?!

SMASH!!! The Protagonist and Kat are THROWN LIKE RAG DOLLS across the car – the Mercedes has SWIPED the nose of the Audi –

Volkov lays down COVER FIRE, pinning Neil as Sator’s men descend on the CRASHED Audi and pull the PROTAGONIST out of the car – shoving him around the back of the Mercedes. Kat is pulled from the wreck and put into the Mercedes –

As they put the Protagonist INTO THE TRUNK, he sees Sator

MOVING BACKWARDS behind the line of cars, from the BMW...
 
82.


EXT. DOCKSIDE AREA, EDGE OF TALLINN – MOMENTS LATER

The TRUNK OPENS – the Protagonist is PULLED OUT. Marched towards an entrance, he sees, through a steel fence dividing the yard in two, SATOR, IN RESPIRATOR, WALKING BACKWARDS, PULLING KAT, FORWARDS, TOWARDS A DIFFERENT ENTRANCE...

The Protagonist passes a stack of SHIPPING CONTAINERS, several of which are marked OSLO FREEPORT...

INT. STORAGE FACILITY, TALLINN FREEPORT – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist is taken past the table of weapons, through a large door, and through RED DOORS with a PORTHOLE...


INT. TURNSTILE, TALLINN FREEPORT – CONTINUOUS

Into A LONG CHAMBER DIVIDED IN TWO BY A GLASS WINDOW – A MUCH BIGGER VERSION OF THE ROTAS VAULT. The Russians push the Protagonist into a chair. This side is lit by RED LIGHT.

On the other side of the glass, lit by BLUE LIGHT, Sator ‘ENTERS’ BACKWARDS, ‘PULLING’ Kat, who is now in a respirator. Sator ‘SHOVES’ her hard into a chair, removes his own respirator, ‘FLIPPING’ it up onto a hook on the wall.

The Protagonist looks into Kat’s frightened eyes... between them, embedded in a whirl of cracked glass, is a BULLET... Sator TURNS to meet the Protagonist’s gaze – his movements have the surreal edge of backwards motion as he places his GUN AGAINST KAT’S HEAD and pulls out his phone...

He holds his PHONE up and plays a recording IN REVERSE –

SATOR
(via recording)
If you’re not telling the truth,
she dies.

Sator moves the phone to his lips, SPEAKING IN REVERSE... the Protagonist stares at him, bemused.

PROTAGONIST
I don’t know what you’re talking
about.

Sator listens to this played backwards...

SATOR
(via recording)
You left it in the car not the fire truck, right?

PROTAGONIST

Who told you that?
 
83.


SATOR
(via recording)
Tell me, now! Is it really in the BMW?

PROTAGONIST

I don’t know!

SATOR
(via recording)
Tell me or I’ll shoot her again!

The Protagonist looks at Kat, who is TERRIFIED –

KAT
(pleading)
Tell him!

– then at Sator –

PROTAGONIST

Leave her alone!

SATOR
(via recording)
I don’t have time to negotiate.

The Protagonist looks at the bullet hole in the glass – WISPS OF SMOKE are gathering...

PROTAGONIST

Listen to me! I can help you!

SATOR
(via recording)
Three...

PROTAGONIST

Don’t!

KAT

Help me!

SATOR
(via recording)
Two...

KAT

PLEASE!

A FAINT TRICKLE of glass dust rises to where the bullet is lodged in the window...

PROTAGONIST

Wait!
 
84.


SATOR
(via recording)
One...

Sator LIFTS Kat – PUSHES her up against the glass...

KAT

PLEASE!

PROTAGONIST

NO!

The SMOKE COALESCES as BANG! The bullet RIPS THROUGH KAT’S SIDE on its inevitable journey to Sator’s gun. Kat SCREAMS –

SATOR
(via recording)
Next one’s a bullet to the head...

He holds up a finger – Kat is SCREAMING –

SATOR (CONT'D)
(via recording)
One...

PROTAGONIST

Please!

SATOR
(via recording)
Two...

PROTAGONIST

No!

SATOR
(via recording)
Three...

PROTAGONIST
Okay! Okay! The car! The BMW! I
left it in the BMW!

Kat’s screams subside to moans as she PASSES OUT...

SATOR
(via recording)
We’re going to check this is real.

PROTAGONIST

It’s in the glove box!

The door OPENS behind the Protagonist –

SATOR (O.S.)

Where did you leave it?
 
85.


The Protagonist spins around – Sator, BEHIND HIM, SMASHES his gun into the Protagonist’s cheek – THIS SATOR IS FORWARDS –

SATOR (CONT'D)

Car or truck – which one?!

Sator HITS him again – the Protagonist falls near the glass – looks up through the glass to see ‘backwards’ Sator, on the blue side, staring at him dispassionately...

SATOR (CONT'D)

Which vehicle did you leave it in?! I need to know before I go out there!

PROTAGONIST

I already told you!

Forwards Sator looks through the window at his inverse self – then turns back to the Protagonist –

SATOR

I believe you...

Sator puts his GUN to the Protagonist’s forehead –

SATOR (CONT'D)
(indicates Kat)
You wanted her here. I hope you’ll be happy together –

Sator COCKS his weapon – BLAMBLAMBLAM! – the double doors behind the Protagonist SMASH open – PARAMILITARIES BURST IN, GUNS BLAZING – the two guards are SHOT – Sator JUMPS FOR THE VAULT – HITS A BUTTON –

On the other side of the glass, INVERTED SATOR runs backwards towards the other vault door –

BOTH SATORS JUMP INSIDE AND ARE GONE –

A Paramilitary SERGEANT enters, gun drawn –

PARAMILITARY SERGEANT

Clear!

The Protagonist looks at the empty vault –

PROTAGONIST

Where’d he go?

PARAMILITARY SERGEANT

The past.
 
86.


INT. TURNSTILE, TALLINN FREEPORT – MOMENTS EARLIER

Sator runs out of the turnstile – into the blue side of the room – on the other side he sees the paramilitary AMBUSH IN REVERSE... for a few seconds he watches his older self interrogate the Protagonist, then fires up his phone, steps up to the glass – the Protagonist SHOUTS PASSIONATELY –

PROTAGONIST
(via recording)
It’s in the glove box!

SATOR

We’re going to check this is real.

PROTAGONIST
(via recording)
Okay! Okay! The car! The BMW! I
left it in the BMW!

The sound of Kat’s MOANING is BUILDING and BUILDING. Sator holds up one finger –

SATOR

Three...

PROTAGONIST
(via recording)
No!

Adds a second finger – Kat is SCREAMING now –

SATOR

Two...

PROTAGONIST
(via recording)
Please!

And a third –

SATOR
One. Next one’s a bullet to the
head.

Kat’s SCREAM CRESCENDOS as Sator GRABS her and pushes her up against the glass, PULLS HIS TRIGGER, ‘HEALING’ her wound –

SATOR (CONT'D)

One...

PROTAGONIST
(via recording)
Wait!

Holds up two fingers –
 
87.


SATOR

Two...

PROTAGONIST
(via recording)
Don’t!

Sator holds up three fingers –

SATOR

Three –

PROTAGONIST
(via recording)
Listen to me! I can help you!

SATOR

I don’t have time to negotiate.

The Protagonist looks confused –

PROTAGONIST
(via recording)
Leave her alone!

SATOR

Tell me or I’ll shoot her again!

PROTAGONIST
(via recording)
I don’t know!

SATOR
Tell me now! Is it really in the
BMW!

PROTAGONIST
(via recording)
Who told you that?

SATOR

You left it in the car not the fire truck, right?

PROTAGONIST
(via recording)
I don’t know what you’re talking
about.

SATOR
If you’re not telling the truth,
she dies.

Sator GRABS his respirator from the hook, PULLS Kat to her feet – DRAGS her backwards through the door, down a corridor into an AIRLOCK, pulls off her respirator, puts his on...
 
88.


INT. TURNSTILE, TALLINN FREEPORT – THE PRESENT

The Protagonist looks through the glass at Kat –

FEMALE PARAMILITARY

She’s been shot!

PARAMILITARY SERGEANT

Get her this side!

Respirator-clad Paramilitaries pull Kat out of the room. The Paramilitary Sergeant turns to the Protagonist.

PARAMILITARY SERGEANT (CONT'D)
Was she shot with an inverted
round?

The Protagonist NODS. Neil enters – gestures to the Sergeant –

NEIL

This is Ives. He’s one of us –

The Protagonist GRABS Neil, THROWS him up against the wall –

PROTAGONIST

Us?! Who are these guys?

NEIL

Priya’s. Ours.

The Paramilitaries bring Kat into the room – the MEDIC, moving SWIFTLY, examines Kat’s wound.

The Protagonist puts his arm AGAINST NEIL’S THROAT –

PROTAGONIST
How did Sator know about the
ambush?

NEIL

Posterity. An ambush on the streets can’t stay out of the record –

PROTAGONIST
Bullshit – he knew every move we
made! Somebody talked – was it
you?!

NEIL

No.

PROTAGONIST

At every stage, you’ve known more than you should. I’m asking you one more time. Did you talk?
 
89.


IVES (O.S.)
Nobody talked. They’re running a
temporal pincer movement.

Ives is next to the Protagonist, ready to help Neil...

PROTAGONIST

A what?

IVES
A pincer movement. But not in space
– in time. Half his team moves forwards through the event – he monitors them, then attacks from the end, moving backwards. Knowing everything.

PROTAGONIST
Except where I stashed the
plutonium.

The Protagonist lets Neil go...

PROTAGONIST (CONT'D)

Which is not plutonium, is it?

NEIL
I told you – it’s what he’s after.
And you just told him where it is.

PROTAGONIST

I lied.

Neil looks at Kat, bleeding out on the gurney.

NEIL

Jesus.

PROTAGONIST

He couldn’t verify from inside the room, he’d have shot her anyway. Lying is standard operating procedure.

The Medic steps away from Kat, shakes his head.

MEDIC

It’s spread too far.

PROTAGONIST

Meaning what?

IVES

She’s going to die.

NEIL
(to Protagonist)
Standard operating procedure?
(MORE)
 
90.

NEIL (CONT'D)

(to Ives)
Can’t you stabilize inverse radiation by inverting the patient?

IVES

That takes days –

The Protagonist points at the turnstile –

PROTAGONIST

Let’s go.

IVES
We took control of this machine
minutes ago – before that it’s
Sator’s.

PROTAGONIST
How long will she live on this
side?

MEDIC

Three hours, tops.

The Protagonist thinks. He looks at Kat, who is dying.

PROTAGONIST

I’m taking her through. I’m not going to let her die, I’ll take my chances out there.

IVES

Chances of what? We’ve got no way to bring you back.

PROTAGONIST

We find another machine.

IVES

A week ago? Where?

The Protagonist looks at Neil – they have the same idea –

NEIL

Oslo.

IVES

That facility’s impregnable. It’s inside an airport security perimeter.

PROTAGONIST

Not last week, it wasn’t. We’re going in. You might as well help.

Ives, shaking his head, joins in. As they carry Kat towards the vault door, Ives points at the glass partition –
 
91.


IVES

This is the proving window... as you approach the turnstile if you don’t see yourself through the proving window, do not enter the machine.

PROTAGONIST

Why not?

IVES

If you haven’t seen yourself reverse-exit the machine, you won’t be getting out. Okay, first in, last out. Get into the turnstile, pass through – I’ll already be there with her.

PROTAGONIST

Is that gonna work?

Ives pauses, watching activity on the other side of the window –

IVES
(points)
Yeah...

The Protagonist turns to see HIMSELF on the other side of the glass, MOVING IN REVERSE, wheeling KAT ‘TOWARDS’ THE VAULT DOOR –

IVES (CONT'D)

Let’s go!

Ives OPENS the door – the Protagonist takes one last look at his backwards self ‘entering’ the machine, then STEPS INSIDE –

We follow him in as the door SHUTS behind him – he puts his back to the wall – the machine starts CLANKING like an MRI – the door opens on the other side – he STEPS OUT...

To see Ives struggling with Kat – he moves to help – Neil is already there (first in, last out).

The Protagonist looks through the glass to where he and Ives now appear to be moving backwards...

The Medic tends to Kat.

MEDIC

She’s stabilizing slowly. I’ll clean and close, the rest is time.

PROTAGONIST

How long does she need?
 
92.


MEDIC

4 or 5 days. A week to be sure.

PROTAGONIST
(to Neil)
Figure out how to get us to Oslo – I’ve got to get back out there –

NEIL

To do what?

PROTAGONIST

To stop Sator getting away with the whatever it is I just gave him.

NEIL

You didn’t – you lied about where it was. Wait, you’re going out there for her.

PROTAGONIST

He threatened to kill her in the past... if he does, what happens to her here?

NEIL

It’s unknowable. If you’re there to make a change, you’re not here to observe its effect.

PROTAGONIST

What do you believe?

NEIL

What’s happened’s happened. We have to save her here and now. And if you go back out there you might hand him exactly what he’s after.

PROTAGONIST
Don’t let them take her back
through –

NEIL

I won’t.

IVES

You can’t stay here.

NEIL

And we don’t have much time – so find us a nice cosy shipping container that just came off a ship from Oslo...

The Protagonist moves towards the door.	Ives steps up –
 
93.


IVES
This is cowboy shit. You have no
idea what you’re getting into if
you go through that door.

PROTAGONIST

Well, I’m going, so any tips would be welcome.

Ives sees determination. Shakes his head.

IVES

Wheeler, brief him.

The female Paramilitary, WHEELER, hands the Protagonist a respirator –

WHEELER

You need your own air – regular air won’t pass through the membranes of inverted lungs. The number-one rule – don’t come into contact with your forwards self – that’s the whole point of these barriers –

Wheeler BANGS on the proving window –

WHEELER (CONT'D)

And protective suits – if any of your particles came into contact –

The Protagonist is putting on the respirator –

PROTAGONIST

What?

WHEELER

Annihilation.

PROTAGONIST

That’s bad, right?

The Protagonist follows Wheeler into a corridor lined with RESPIRATORS and HAZARD SUITS... at the end is an AIRLOCK...

WHEELER

When you exit the airlock, take a moment to orient yourself – things will feel strange. When you run, the wind will be at your back. If you encounter fire, ice will form on your suit, as the transfer of heat is reversed. Gravity will feel normal, but appear reversed for the world around you. Don’t worry about things falling, so much as rising.
(MORE)
 
94.

WHEELER (CONT'D)

If you see an object demonstrating unprompted instability, stay clear, it may be about to leap into the air. You may experience distortions to your vision and hearing – this is normal – light waves and sound waves are propagating away from you. This should clear as your brain adjusts.

PROTAGONIST

Can I drive a car?

IVES

Cowboy shit.

Ives and Neil are grabbing respirators...

WHEELER

I can’t vouch for the handling, friction and wind resistance are reversed. You’re inverted, the world is not. You can’t fight the prevailing wind of entropy. Don’t try flying a plane – it’d fall out of the sky. Once again, you’re inverted, the world is not – and those forces will be pushing back on you continuously.

The Protagonist turns to Neil –

PROTAGONIST
Was there a transponder on the
case?

NEIL

He’ll have tossed the case –

PROTAGONIST

I’m going backwards – that’s the ball I have to follow. Give me the reader.

Neil hands him a phone. The Protagonist sticks a Bluetooth earpiece in his ear, passes into the airlock – Wheeler shuts it behind him. Then opens the OUTER DOOR...


EXT. YARD, TALLINN FREEPORT – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist emerges into a strange world – the air feels different, the friction of his feet on the asphalt feels different. He looks up at birds flying backwards... at steam contracting... at a pile of dust sucking itself bigger...

In the yard he spots the SAAB... he runs over, finds the keys sitting on the front tyre –
 
95.


INT./EXT. SAAB – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist LOOKS in the glove box – NOTHING – LOOKS in the wheel well – NOTHING – the back seat – NOTHING. He gives up – starts the engine... pulls out, gently, feeling out the strange handling of the vehicle...


INT./EXT. SAAB, TALLINN STREETS – MOMENTS LATER

The Protagonist steers the car around BACKWARDS-MOVING TRAFFIC and BACKWARDS-WALKING PEDESTRIANS, MARVELLING...

People STARE at the car as it approaches, as if they already know a backwards-driven car is heading their way (which, of course, they do).

He checks the phone – a blinking dot half a mile away – he GUNS it, FISHTAILING unexpectedly...


EXT. HIGHWAY – CONTINUOUS

We see the fire fight from before IN REVERSE – Neil laying down fire from between cars, Kat carried ‘back’ to the Audi...

Behind Neil, Sator, MOVING FORWARDS, checks the glove compartment of the BMW... NOTHING. FUMING, he heads back to the Mercedes, DUCKING behind cars, bullets FLYING...


INT./EXT. SAAB – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist pulls onto a busy highway where the cars are FACING HIM, BUT MOVING IN HIS DIRECTION...

The Saab races along, the only normal-looking car on a road full of cars SPEEDING BACKWARDS...

On the phone, the flashing dot is CLOSER...

Slowing, the Protagonist spots the ORANGE CASE lying empty by the side of the road. He PULLS OVER some distance away – JUMPS out of the car – pulls out his BLUETOOTH EARPIECE and WEDGES it between the foam padding and the orange plastic...

The Protagonist heads back to his car, checks the signal from his phone... PEERS at the case...

The case SHUDDERS TO LIFE – LEAPS INTO THE WINDOW OF A PASSING CAR – THE MERCEDES –

The Protagonist PEELS OUT, DUST FLIES UP IN CLOUDS THAT DON’T FULLY BLOSSOM as expected, but CONTRACT...

The Protagonist STRUGGLES with the wheel, trying to keep the car on the road with its unaccustomed handling...
 
96.


PROTAGONIST

Christ!

He can see the Mercedes up ahead, weaving through traffic...


EXT. HIGHWAY, TALLINN – CONTINUOUS

The Mercedes races back up the off-ramp – the Saab follows, weaving through traffic which faces him, but travels backwards –

As the Saab gets within a couple car lengths, his phone cuts in with audio from his Bluetooth bug in the Mercedes –

SATOR
(over radio)
– the material’s not in the case –

Sound cuts in and out – FRAGMENTS of voices – he struggles to keep pace with the Mercedes – he listens hard –

SATOR (CONT'D)
(over radio)
–Get the other sections of the algorithm to the hypocentre– –He was lying– –it wasn’t in the BMW–

INVERTED DRIVER
(over radio)
So where is it?


INT. /EXT. SAAB – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist finds a clear lane and guns the engine, tracking the Mercedes as it pulls alongside the Audi, racing ‘forwards’, and Sator, orange case in hand, climbs from the Mercedes into the Audi...

The Audi pulls alongside the BMW – the Protagonist, sensing the moment, LOWERS HIS WINDOW... Sator lifts the orange case, BUT HIS EYES ARE ELSEWHERE –

Inside the Saab, the Protagonist hears BANGING – the BLACK METAL SHAPE ‘unwedges’ from where it’s been stuck down the side of a seat – ‘BOUNCING’ around the interior –

The Saab CUTS between the Audi and the BMW –

The orange case FLIES OUT OF SATOR’S HANDS – BOUNCES OFF THE SAAB’S WINDSHIELD, ‘LANDING’ IN THE BMW –

JUST AS THE BLACK METAL SHAPE JUMPS OUT OF THE SAAB AND INTO THE (FORWARD) PROTAGONIST’S LOWER HAND...
 
97.


Sator, SEEING THIS, YANKS the wheel – CLIPS the Saab – the Protagonist STRUGGLES for control – but the Saab SPINS AND ROLLS DOWN THE HIGHWAY, COMING TO REST ON ITS ROOF.

The Protagonist, upside down in the car, regains consciousness... fuel leaks, pooling outside the window... he sees expensive shoes approach, then Sator’s face peering in at him. In his hand is a LIGHTER.

SATOR
I saw the hand-off. You made me
shoot her for nothing.

Sator tips his lighter to read his fitness tracker...

SATOR (CONT'D)

You did get my pulse above 130. No one’s done that before. Not even my wife.

Backing away, Sator DROPS the lighter, the fuel EXPLODES, THROWING THE CAR SIDEWAYS – BUT INSTEAD OF FULLY BLOOMING, THE FLAMES CONTRACT, SPARING THE PROTAGONIST WHO LIES THERE, FREEZING. HE PASSES OUT.

FADE IN:


INT. SHIPPING CONTAINER – LATER

The Protagonist comes to on a stretcher. Kat is on a stretcher next to him. Neil sits between them. The Protagonist looks at his hands, feels his face, confused.

NEIL
The heat transfer was reversed –
you may be the first case of
hypothermia from a gasoline
explosion in history.

PROTAGONIST

At this point, nothing surprises.

The Protagonist looks around the shipping container.

NEIL

You left Ives and his team one hell of a clean-up.

PROTAGONIST

We’re on our way back to Oslo?

NEIL

In a Rotas shipping container.

PROTAGONIST
He’s got the material, Neil. I
handed it to him on a plate.
 
98.


NEIL

I warned you –

PROTAGONIST

‘What’s happened’s happened.’ I get it, now. But it’s tough to take things on trust from people speaking half-truths.

NEIL

That’s not fair –

PROTAGONIST
You were part of this before we
met. Were you working for Priya?

NEIL

No.

PROTAGONIST

Who recruited you, Neil?

NEIL

It can’t possibly do you any good to know that right now. When this is over, if we’re still standing and you still care, you can hear my life story, okay?

Kat GROANS, her eyes flicker open to see the Protagonist.

PROTAGONIST

I’m sorry I involved you.

KAT
You need to tell me what’s going
on.

PROTAGONIST
Apparently, Neil here knows more
about it than I do.
(to Neil)
Good luck, pal.

NEIL

By telling Kat anything we’re compromising her in Priya’s eyes.

PROTAGONIST

In Priya’s eyes she’s already compromised. And she has a right to know why she might die.

KAT

I’m going to die?
 
99.


PROTAGONIST
Not if we have anything to say
about it.

NEIL

And we do.

KAT

Who are you?

NEIL

Let me start with the simple stuff. Every law of physics operates the same forwards and backwards, except one. Entropy...

The Protagonist moves to the back of the container, pulls out his phone, checks Neil’s attention is on Kat...

SATOR
(via recording)
–bring– –final section– –directly to the hypocentre– –with the other parts– –the algorithm–

The recording breaks up. The Protagonist puts the phone away, FLEXES his elbow, feeling out some pain... He rolls up his sleeve – there is a DARK PATCH of skin forming –

NEIL

Are you injured?

PROTAGONIST

What’s the ‘algorithm’, Neil?

NEIL

The 241 is one section of it. One out of nine. It’s a formula rendered into physical form so it can’t be copied or communicated. A black box with one function.

PROTAGONIST

Which is?

NEIL
Inversion. But not objects or
people. The world around us.

KAT

I don’t understand.

NEIL

As they invert the entropy of more and more objects...

Neil holds his hands, fingers spread, pointing at each other –
 
100.


NEIL (CONT'D)
The two directions of time are
becoming more intertwined...

He slowly brings his fingers together, into the ‘Tenet’ gesture –

NEIL (CONT'D)

But because the environment’s entropy flows in our direction...

He pushes one hand back with the other –

NEIL (CONT'D)

...we dominate. They’re always swimming upstream. It’s what saved your life – the inverted explosion was pushing against the environment.

PROTAGONIST

Pissing in the wind.

NEIL
But the algorithm can change the
direction of that wind. It can
invert the entropy of the world.

KAT

And if that happens?

NEIL

Oh, end of play.

PROTAGONIST

‘End of play’? Can you be a little more precise?

NEIL

Our present wiped out, our past obliterated. Everyone and everything who ever lived destroyed instantly. Precise enough?

KAT

Including my son.

Neil nods, gravely. Kat winces, clearly in pain.

NEIL
Let me sedate you – the more you
sleep the faster you’ll heal.

Neil injects Kat in the arm. Her eyes close.
