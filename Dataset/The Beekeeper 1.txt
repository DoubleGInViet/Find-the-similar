VAN MORRISON’S TUPELO HONEY plays as ...

THE Rolling Countryside of North Mississippi - unchanged since it was created by God all those years ago, floats past.

VAN MORRISON
She’s as sweet as Tupelo Honey
She’s an angel of the first degree
She’s as sweet as Tupelo Honey
Just like honey baby, from the bee.

Fields and forests cultivated and uncultivated that glisten in that perfect Southern light.

WOMAN’S VOICE
I don’t know how to thank you, Mr. Clay. Those things scare me literally to death ...


INT. GARAGE - DAY

In the corner of the garage, ADAM CLAY, protected in a white BEE-KEEPER’S SUIT, first sprays a HORNET’S NEST with FREON, briefly freezing it ...

CLAY
The freon will freeze the nest for a few moments - but then ...

With the end of a rake, he dislodges the nest dropping into a paper bag, which he closes tightly around the tube of a FLOURESCENT LIGHT BULB, whose top remains sticking out after he has tied the bag off around it.

CLAY (CONT'D)
The hornets - well they’ll wake up.

Stopping near the ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN whose home it is - who stands at the entrance of her garage, he touches his ear.

Listen ...

Turning up her hearing-aid, she turns her head, leaning
forward slightly, eyes widening behind her glasses as ...

CLAY (CONT'D)
(a small smile)

You’ve heard the term, ‘kicked the hornet’s nest’?

... an ANGRY BUZZING begins to emanate from the bag, along with the sound and shadows of TINY BODIES visible furiously slamming at the inside of the bag.
 
2.


ELOISE
What will you do with them?

CLAY
Unfortunately - destroy them. Not only are they potentially damaging to people, but they can be very damaging to bees too. Even though there are thousands of bees, just a few hornets can cause what’s called ‘colony collapse disorder’. They can destroy an entire hive.
(a smile)
And ‘Where the Honey Bee goes’,
Eloise - so go we.’

Clay pulls off the helmet of his bee keeper’s suit, revealing a pleasant man in his early 40’s.

CLAY (CONT'D)
By the way, Mrs. Lincoln - I do appreciate it - you putting up with all the bees?

ELOISE
What?	Oh shush.	They make the
flowers so sweet and beautiful.

CLAY
(a smile)
They do.


EXT. BACK HOUSE - DAY

Stripping off his bee keeper’s suit as he goes, Clay walks with the brown paper bag, that is literally rattling with angry awakened hornets, back towards the small home he rents on the property.



INT. SHED - DAY

Entering, he hangs up his bee suit, and setting the raging paper bag onto the work-bench, he squeezes it, just below where it is tied off - shattering that portion of the fluorescent bulb that is inside the bag.

Taking a CATTLE PROD down from a HIGHLY ORGANIZED PEG-BOARD of tools, he touches its two electrodes to the two electrical nodes that dot the end of the bulb that still sticks out from the bag. He pulls the trigger and instantly ... with a snap!
 
3.


The portion of the light that still protrudes out of the bag lights - as does the entire bag, fwumping! with light and inflation as electricity rips through the released mercury vapor and ...

Just as instantly - both go dark - and the bag goes dead silent and still. Everything inside electrocuted.


EXT. SHED - DAY

Exiting, Clay tosses the paper bag into the garbage as he makes his way back thru the field of flowers behind his little rental home and to ...

The small collection of BEE-HIVES he keeps there - swarms of bees busily rising and returning, hard at work, doing those things that busy bees do.

Going from one hive to the next, seemingly unconcerned about getting stung, bees seemingly equally unmindful of him - he lifts off the hive-tops, peering in, making sure all is well.

He sits down in the semi-circle of his hives, in the field of flowers. Leans back on his hands, crosses his legs and looks up into the blue sky, bees buzzing everywhere.


INT. ELOISE LINCOLN’S HOUSE - DAY

Puttering a cup of tea from the stove to the kitchen table, Eloise opens her laptop and starts her Skype app. She takes a sip of tea and is about to start a call to her daughter when an ANGRY RED BOX materializes onto her screen.

She pauses. Cleaning her glasses, she leans in and, lips moving, carefully reads what it says:

Warning! Your Computer’s Hard Drive Is Infected. Call 1 888 333 2487 Immediately To Avoid Complete Shutdown.

Eloise blinks at it. She tries to close the window. But the angry message aggressively rematerializes immediately.

She glances out her window. CLAY can be seen out in the field, tending to the hives. She thinks.

With a sigh, she picks up the phone and carefully - one number at a time - dials the number on the screen.

The other end answers immediately.
 
4.


PHONE
Data Group.	Good afternoon, how
may I help you?

ELOISE
Well, I just got this message
saying that there was something
wrong with my computer?

PHONE
Yes, Ma’am.	What were you doing

ELOISE
I - nothing - I was ... about to
Skype with my daughter.	It’s our

ELOISE
‘Uninstall’ ... ?	well ...

PHONE
If you cannot do it, you can take it to an IT person or computer shop in your town or neighborhood.

ELOISE
.... oh ...

PHONE
Or we can do it now at the same
time that I send you your $100.
Would you like to do it now?

ELOISE
Well ... yes.	I guess that would
be best.	Yes.

PHONE
Not a problem.	I’ll need you to

that?

ELOISE
Ah ... let me see ...
(typing)

Great.	Please let me know when

ELOISE
Okay, I think ... okay, yes.

Very good. Now I’m going to give you my username and password so that I can directly install the new software onto your computer. Type Username: Friendlyfriend ... and password, HAPPYGOLUCKY123 - all capitol letters, okay?

ELOISE
Um ... okay ... I think ...

PHONE
Yes, I can see your computer now.
Please stand by ...
 
6.


She waits. Looks out the kitchen window again. CLAY distantly visible out at the bee hives.

When she looks back to her screen, her CURSOR is racing across it, pages like Paypal and Amazon opening and closing with great speed.

ELOISE
(phone)
Hello?

PHONE
Yes, Ms. Lincoln.	I’m here.	Do
not touch your keyboard.	Do you
use Paypal?

ELOISE
Paypal?	No, I don’t think so.

PHONE
That is not a problem. Just a convenient way for us to pay you. But not a problem. I see here you do your banking on-line with the Bank of North Mississippi?

ELOISE
Well, I don’t myself. My daughter will sometimes do it for me on the computer when she’s here.

PHONE
Not a problem, Ms. Lincoln.	Will
you please go ahead and sign into
your on-line banking account now.

ELOISE
Well I ... I’m not sure I remember my password.

PHONE
Not a problem. Just think very hard, Ms. Lincoln. It’s important we get you your $100 today before the offer expires. I’ll pull the page up for you. You see, there’s your user-name but your computer does not seem to have passwords stored. Please go ahead and enter your password now.

Eloise looks with slight panic at the keyboard. Types a few characters, erases them, types them in again. Cringes. Hits enter.
 
7.


Wrong Username or Password returns.

ELOISE
I ... I’m sorry but I - I really
really don’t remember ...

PHONE
Ms. Lincoln.	This important.	Do
you have an Amazon Prime account?
What is the password to that?
Maybe they are the same.

ELOISE
I don’t have Amazon.	But maybe I
could call my daughter and...

PHONE
No Ms. Lincoln, don’t call anyone. Time is running out and if we hang up we may not be able to reconnect before the offer expires. Just take a breath - and think hard.

ELOISE
But, these things make me very
nervous and ...
(rising)
If I can just...

PHONE
Ms. Lincoln - where are you going?

ELOISE
(blinks)
What do you mean?

PHONE
Ms. Lincoln, please sit back down. Ms. Lincoln, do you want your computer to shut down? Permanently?

ELOISE
No, of course n...

PHONE
And lose all of your files? All of your pictures? Of children and family? Everything?

ELOISE
No I...
 
8.


PHONE
Then I need you to sit back down, right now, and work with me in order to get your computer fixed and you paid your $100. Do you maybe have your passwords written down somewhere? Maybe in a file on the computer? Maybe your daughter did it for you?

ELOISE
Well ... I ...

PHONE
I’ll help you look.
(sound of typing)
This Computer... Documents... Files ... ah - ‘passwords’, perfect ... okay, Mrs. Lincoln - stand by ...

She sits, blinking, watching as a password is typed into the home-page of the banking website ...

And suddenly, all of her banking information scrolls onto the screen. Including her balance of just over $205,000.

ELOISE
(a clap)
Oh!	Yay!	We did it!
(a smile)
Well - you did it.

But silence.	No reply.	Abruptly, the screen goes black.
She blinks.

ELOISE (CONT'D)
My screen just went blank.

PHONE
It’s all right. Just sit tight Ms. Lincoln while we enter all of the necessary banking information on our end to transfer the money into your account ... just sit tight and don’t go anywhere or do anything...

ELOISE
Uh.	Okay.

She sits.	Waiting.

ELOISE (CONT'D)
Are you still there?
 
9.


Again, she waits. Only now, the phone in her hand begins BEEPING. She frowns. It sounds like the line disconnected.

ELOISE (CONT'D)
Hello?

Suddenly, her screen flashes back to life with her banking information. Squinting, she leans forward, studying it.

ELOISE (CONT'D)
... oh ...


INT. FIELD - LATE DAY

CLAY cranks the handle on the EXTRACTOR, spinning the hive frames inside, extracting the honey.

Placing a bucket with a sieve beneath the extractor, he opens the valve.


He can’t help but smile as pure, golden honey - with small bits of beeswax in it, comes pouring out - catching and re-amplifying the late day’s rays.


EXT. ELOISE LINCOLN'S HOUSE - LATE DAY

Holding a QUART JAR of honey, CLAY stands on the doorstep of Eloise’s house out in front of his. He knocks again. Waits.

CLAY
(calls)
Ms. Lincoln?

He turns, looks into the driveway. Her 1977 Lincoln station wagon is sitting there. He turns back. Studies the house.

Listening ...

Tries the doorknob.	It is unlocked.


INT. ELOISE LINCOLN'S HOUSE - DUSK

He steps into the kitchen.	Silent in the fading light.

Except for the distant BEEPING that is coming out of the PHONE that lies on the kitchen table beside the computer.

He registers first the phone, number on the screen along with the message, ‘Call Failed. Reconnect?’ still on it.
 
10.


He looks to the computer screen. Takes that in. Then turns his attention to the silent house.

CLAY
Ms. Lincoln?

Nothing. Setting the quart of honey onto the table beside the computer and phone, he starts into the house.


INT. ELOISE LINCOLN'S HOUSE - DUSK

He stops in the doorway to the living room.

The day’s fading light flows like a slow tide into thru all the room’s windows silhouetting ELOISE’S FIGURE dangling from the lamp-cord attached to the light-fixture in the center of the room, piano stool lying on its side beneath her.

VOICE
Don’t move!	Don’t fucking move!

Clay remains one final instant taking in Eloise’s hanging body. Then, lacing his hands behind his head, he goes down to his knees one at a time.

A FOOT kicks him square between the shoulder-blades and he goes down, one hand yanking both his hands down behind his back while another pushes a snub-nose .38 into the back of his skull - and the first snaps handcuffs onto his wrists.

BLACK WOMAN
Who the fuck are you!?	What are
you doing here??

He doesn’t say anything. He just lies there, handcuffed, silent. She digs a heel into his ribs.

BLACK WOMAN (CONT'D)
I said what the fuck’re you doing in my mother’s house you asshole!?

Still he doesn’t say anything.	Just listens as she stops
looking at him and instead looks up into the room and ...

BLACK WOMAN (O.S.) (CONT'D)
... oh ... my ...

Forgetting about him, her feet go running past his head. He hears the sounds of struggle. Of someone trying to lift the weight of a hanging body.

BLACK WOMAN (O.S.) (CONT'D)
Mom!	Mom!
 
11.


Clay closes his eyes.


EXT. ELOISE LINCOLN’S HOUSE - NIGHT

POLICE CARS - lights flashing - are everywhere.	Clay sits on
the house steps, handcuffed while ...

VERONA LINCOLN stands talking to the police detectives.

POLICE DETECTIVE
It’s preliminary - but I gotta be honest with you Agent - right now, no signs of struggle, it does - I’m sorry - look like suicide to me.

VERONA LINCOLN
Then what the fuck was he doing in my mother’s house??

POLICE DETECTIVE
(looks over at Clay)

Well, I don’t know. I’m gonna ask him.


VERONA LINCOLN
No - we’re gonna ask him.

He looks at her.	Sighs.

POLICE DETECTIVE
All right then.


EXT. STEPS - ELOISE LINCOLN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Verona and the two Police Detectives approach Clay seated on the steps.


POLICE DETECTIVE
Mr ...
(consults notes)
‘Clay’, do I have that right?

Clay just looks at him.

POLICE DETECTIVE (CONT'D) You’ve been advised of your rights, right?

Silently, Clay shrugs.

POLICE DETECTIVE (CONT'D)
Do you?	Wanna talk to us?
 
12.


CLAY
Don’t have much to say.

VERONA LINCOLN
How about what the fuck you were
doing in my mother’s house??

The Police Detective shoots her a look.

VERONA LINCOLN (CONT'D) I want to know. What was he doing there??

CLAY
I was bringing her a jar of honey.

VERONA LINCOLN
What? What? You were bringing her a jar of honey?? What the fuck are you? The Good Honey Man??

CLAY
(quietly)
I keep bees.

VERONA LINCOLN
You what?

CLAY
I keep bees.	I’m a retired
professional bee-keeper.

The answer is so strange that the three law-officers stand there staring at him a beat.

VERONA LINCOLN
Okay ... okay. So you keep fucking bees. So you’re a bee-keeper. How did you even know my mother??

CLAY
I’m rent the small structure behind this one from her.
(looks up)
You were present when I signed the lease. You may not remember, but we’ve met.

The two cops look to Verona - who looks from Clay - to the small house standing at the edge of the field out back.

VERONA LINCOLN
Okay. Maybe that’s true. But what were you doing in her house?
 
13.


CLAY
Mrs. Lincoln and I were friends. I liked her. I liked her lemon meringue. And she liked my honey. And I think she liked me. When she didn’t answer and I noted her car in the driveway, I became concerned.


POLICE DETECTIVE
‘Noted’?	Do you have law
enforcement background?

Clay takes in a tired breath.	Looks up.

CLAY
I told you.	I take care of bees.

The other three exchange another glance.

POLICE DETECTIVE
(closing his notebook) All right. You’re not under arrest, Mr. Clay - but would you mind coming down to the station so we can fingerprint you; take your statement? Just as a matter of formality?

Clay sits there a moment.	Looks up.	Sighs.

CLAY
Let’s go.

Together, the two Police Detectives pick handcuffed Clay up off the steps - spare a look for Verona - and walk him to the nearest cruiser. She watches at they push him into the car.


EXT. BACK RENTAL HOUSE - NIGHT

The door opens, Verona enters. Stops. The lights are low and the place is sparely furnished.

But there are TELEVISION SCREENS everywhere. Each one tuned to a different local and national NEWS CHANNEL.


INT. SHED - NIGHT

She enters. Surveys the VARIOUS WORK BENCHES, spread with tools, diopters, swing-arm magnifiers.
 
14.


EXT. FIELD - NIGHT

She stops at the edge of the field. Reaching under her jacket, she pulls out her mag-light. As she does, we get the first glimpse of her FBI BADGE hanging by a chain from her neck.

She shines her light across the BEE HIVES - that stand, along with the flowers, bright spots under her light in the night.


INT. ELOISE LINCOLN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

FORENSIC investigators are combing through the house when Verona enters. Spotting her, the lead Forensic Investigator heads her way.


FORENSIC INVESTIGATOR Agent. Good developments. We managed to pull prints off both the lamp cord and the light fixture it was tied to ...

Verona looks at him.

VERONA
So - then we’ve got him ...

FORENSIC INVESTIGATOR
After we match the prints.	In
theory, yes.

She nods.

VERONA
Okay.	Thank you.

He nods, returning to his work. Her eyes sweep through the kitchen. Settle on the QUART JAR OF HONEY sitting on the kitchen table.


Pulling on a pair of disposable gloves, she carefully picks it up - holds it up to the light. Golden, with bits of beeswax suspended in it like tiny insects in amber.

Sets it back down. Picks up HER MOTHER’S PHONE. Someone has turned it off. Powering it on, she pulls up ‘Recent Calls’ - scrutinizes them. Snaps a picture of the screen with her own phone.

Her eyes settle on the LAPTOP sitting open on the table. She touches the mousepad. The screen comes to life.

She blinks at it.	Bends.	Examines it ...
 
15.


Then straightens.

VERONA (CONT'D)
... oh ... my god ...


EXT. STEPS - ELOISE LINCOLN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Late now. Verona sits on the steps when a car pulls up. CLAY emerging out of the passenger, the Police Detective out from behind the wheel.


As Clay, no longer handcuffed, heads wordlessly off towards the back house, the Police Detective comes to Verona.

POLICE DETECTIVE
Agent Lincoln - I’m sorry - but the prints - cord, light-fixture; everything - all came back positive for your mother.

(nods)
It seems - sadly - it was suicide.

Verona looks back.

VERONA
I know.

POLICE DETECTIVE
(surprised)
You do?

VERONA
(a beat/a nod)
Yeah.

POLICE DETECTIVE
Well ...

Not knowing quite what to say, he instead hands her his card.

POLICE DETECTIVE (CONT'D)
There’ll still be an inquest,
obviously, but ... call me if you
have any questions?

VERONA
Yeah.	Thanks.

A beat. He heads back for his car. She stares at his card, staring through it with distant eyes as he pulls away.
 
16.


INT. BACK HOUSE - DAWN

Clay is pouring himself a glass of milk in the small kitchen when Verona sticks her head in through the door.

VERONA
Mr. Clay? I’m - sorry about my aggressive attitude last night ...

He pauses his pouring of the milk an instant.	Then ...

CLAY
(continues pouring)
It’s understandable.

She considers him.	The milk.

VERONA
Could I - interest you in anything stronger?

He looks at her now.	Considers.	Shrugs.

CLAY
No.	But I’ll sit with you if you
like.


INT. KITCHEN - ELOISE LINCOLN’S HOUSE - DAWN

She settles in across from him with a cup of coffee. His milk sits in front of him.

VERONA
Look.	I appreciate you taking an
interest and keeping an eye on my
mom.	I do.

CLAY
(a beat/a sigh)
Being old can be lonely in this
country.
(a shrug)
Turn a certain age, you cease to
exist.
(shakes head)
I don’t know if you’ve traveled but

-	England, Italy, Germany - other places - it’s not like that. Older people stay part of life. Part of the family, the community...

(another shrug)
The hive, I guess you could say - till the day they die.
(MORE)
 
17.

CLAY (CONT'D)
(shakes head again)
But not here.	Not this country.

Verona looks down.

VERONA
Yeah I - guess I never thought about it that way. I mean I - tried to stay involved in her life. Took care of all her business but...



She wipes at a tear emerging in the corner of her eye.

VERONA (CONT'D)
Obviously I could have done a
better job.

She pulls herself back together.

VERONA (CONT'D)
I’m a federal agent, you know?

CLAY
(face registering nothing)
That’s impressive.

VERONA
Cyber-crimes.
(shakes head/then)
I think my mom got scammed today. By an outfit - a call-center - Data Group - right up in Memphis where my field office is. Cleaned out her account; her entire savings. Everything she and my dad worked so hard all their lives for ...
(shakes head)

She would have lost everything else too. This house; everything. And I don’t make enough that I could have saved her even if I tried.
(a breath/looks at him)

I’m gonna get these mother fuckers. (shakes head)

But these crimes are nearly impossible to prove. They’ll just do what they always do - insist that the elderly person signed into their banking platform - which they generally did do - and then wired them - complete strangers - their entire life-savings. And in some cases, like my mom’s?
(MORE)
 
18.

VERONA (CONT'D)
There’s not even an elderly person left to say it’s not even true.

She closes her eyes.	But then, opening them, she nods.

VERONA (CONT'D)
But I’m going to get them.	If I
have fight through the courts for
30 years, I’m gonna get them.	I
promise you that.

She reflects.	Nods.

VERONA (CONT'D)
Sorry.	Thanks for listening.	I
just needed to say that out loud.

Clay looks back.

CLAY
Taking advantage of, hurting an elderly person is as bad as hurting a child. Maybe worse. Because they have less time to recover from the damage. And less time to fight back.

(he nods)
And people protect young people.
When someone hurts a child, there
are parents - people who care,
ready to speak up.
(shakes head)

But when someone hurts an old person - sometimes, because they’ve been pushed out of society, or they don’t have kids or family and they’re all alone - it just goes unnoticed. Or no one cares.

A beat.	He nods.	He rises.

VERONA
Get some rest okay?

He pauses at the door.

CLAY
I will. Thank you.	But first I
have an appointment.

VERONA
But you’ve been up all night.

Looking back, he nods.
 
19.


CLAY
I have an appointment.


EXT. PARKING LOT - DATA GROUP - MEMPHIS - MORNING

It’s on the early side in this business park, parking lot entirely full, when CLAY pulls up in his pick-up truck, bed scattered with bee-keeping implements, and getting out, he pulls two GASOLINE CANS out of the truck-bed and heads for the front doors of the glass and steel building.


EXT. ENTRANCE - DATA GROUP - MORNING

The TWO OFF-DUTY but uniformed POLICE OFFICERS standing at the doors look with alarm when they see a man walking towards them with TWO RED GAS-CANS.

OFF-DUTY COP 1
Whoa whoa!	Where the hell do you
think you’re going??

Clay stops in front of them.

CLAY
Is this Data Group?

OFF-DUTY COP 1
What? Who the fuck are you? Where do you think you’re going?

CLAY
If this is Data Group - the call
center - I’m going inside.	I’m
going to burn it down.

The two cops exchange a glance.  Almost have to laugh. OFF-DUTY COP 1
Whoa whoa - okay - no you’re not buddy. You’re not going any-fucking-where as a matter of a fact

-	except back the way you came. That is if I don’t bust your ass down to a nub right here and now.

CLAY
What are you? Off-duty cops? Moonlighting? Making a little extra money. Do you know what they do here?
 
20.


OFF-DUTY COP 1
Buddy - I’m gonna count to three.

CLAY
One two three.	There, did it for
you.

He sets down the gas cans.

CLAY (CONT'D)
Do you know they call and target the weakest in our society? The ones with the least protection and if they can, they steal everything they have. Do you know that’s who you work for?

OFF-DUTY COP 1
All right.	You had your chance.

He reaches for Clay, but Clay slaps his hand away without moving. The cops look at him. Look at each other.

Suddenly the first cop goes for his SIDE-ARM, but Clay is there first, slamming it back down into the holster before it’s even half-way out. He steps back.

The cops exchange a glance. The cop goes for his gun again - but Clay slaps it back into its holster again.

CLAY
I’ll ask you one more time. Then, I’m warning you, if you don’t give me a direct answer - I’m going to assume it’s a ‘yes’. And you’re going to have to live with that.
(nods)
Do you know who you’re working for?

The cops look at each other - him - and then go for him. But he’s faster, much faster. Before the first cop even knows it, with one hand, Clay has unbuckled the man’s gun/web-belt and, ripping it off thru his belt-loops, spins the man as he kicks him backwards thru the shattering glass doors and ...

Turning, smashes the other cop in the face with the heavy leather strap - and equipment laden-belt ...

... handcuffs and pepper spray, magazines and tasers exploding out of it with the impact as he whips the man around the torso with it and re-buckling it as the skin-cutting buckle comes lashing back around he ...
 
21.


Kicks the torso-bound man smashing back thru the other glass panel to join his friend on the glass-strewn floor inside.

Picking up the gas cans, Clay proceeds inside.


INT. RECEPTION - DATA GROUP - MORNING

Clay stops at the astonished and frozen Receptionist.

CLAY
What floor is Data Group on?

Terrified, the Receptionist can only hold up 3 trembling fingers.


CLAY (CONT'D)
Tell any other companies in the building to evacuate now. There’s going to be a fire.


INT. CALL CENTER - MORNING

The elevator doors open and eyes rise from call stations as CLAY steps in, two gas-cans in hand.

Phones frozen at ears, everyone watches as he enters. Setting one of the cans on top of a desk in front of a call-station he ...

CLAY
(call pitch rep)
Hang up the phone.

...starts splashing GASOLINE across the floor with the other.

DATA GROUP REP
What ... what are you doing?

Clay stops.	Looks at him.

CLAY
I said hang up the phone.

The young man blinks back at him.

DATA GROUP REP
(then/into phone)
I’m ... sorry Mrs. Perkins - I’ll
have to call you back ...

He hangs up.	Clay goes back to spreading gasoline.
 
22.


CLAY
(everyone else)
Everyone.	Hang up.

All up and down the rows of call stations, startled faces hang up their phones. Clay picks up the other gas can.

CLAY (CONT'D)
Repeat after me. I will never steal from the weak and vulnerable ever again.


There is a collective swallow. Then, more or less together they repeat ...


CALL CENTER EMPLOYEES
... we will never steal from the
weak and vulnerable again ...

CLAY
Good. And to help you keep that promise, I’m going to now burn your place of business to the ground. So I’d get out of here if I were you.

There is the slightest beat. Then, as one, they all jump up and go rushing for the exits as Clay continues dousing the computers and call-stations with gasoline.

VOICE
What! The Fuck!	Do you think you
think you’re DOING!?

Clay looks to see a MAN IN HIS 30’s there with the TWO OFF-DUTY COPS and several other SECURITY OFFICERS.

CLAY
I’m a Bee-Keeper. Sometimes when I want to smoke hornets - the natural predators of bees - out of their nests - I use fire.

GARNETT (THE VOICE)
The fuck you will!	This a multi-
million dollar operation asshole.
(security)
Get his ass!

And they - all six of them charge for Clay down the aisle.

But Clay just reaches over one of the desks and yanks the
HANDSETS of TWO TELEPHONES out by their cords and ...
 
23.


Swinging them like maces, MEETS them in the aisle, laying into them, TEETH, BLOOD and MUCUS flying until ...

He catches both handsets in his hands and proceeds to use them a BATTERING TOOLS, hammering their ends in both directions into every piece of hard and soft tissue that gets in his way until ...

They ... everyone of them - bloody and brutalized - are down.

He turns to look to GARNETT (who spoke) - who stands astonished - down the aisle.

CLAY
Now - I don’t care whether your
friends here live or die.	But the
next call that your little phishing
scam generates back to this call
center?	It’s also going to
generate an electrical charge in
the wires of the phones I just
ripped out of the wall and, given
all the gasoline fumes in here now?
(he nods)
I’d suggest - this place is gonna
go up like Nagasaki.

Heading up the aisle he passes Garnett and ...

CLAY (CONT'D)
Up to you.

Pushes out thru the emergency exit and disappears. Garnett looks at him astonished. Then goes running for the men rolling around in agony down the aisle.


INT. KITCHEN - DAY

An ELDERLY MAN, talking to his son on Skype pauses as his screen fills with a box that says, ‘WARNING, YOUR COMPUTER HAS BEEN COMPROMISED!

He tries to close it, but can’t.

ELDERLY MAN
(at his computer)
Jack, Son - if you can hear me -
I’ll call you back.

Picking up his house phone, he squints - and dials the number there.


SIGNAL ripping away down the cord - into his kitchen wall ...
 
24.


Out thru the phone lines of his house...

Across the lines stretching across the country-side ...

All the way to a distant BUSINESS PARK, where the electrical
signal goes tearing into a building ...

Up thru it’s 20-lane freeways of electrical wiring ...

And comes out the wall thru a ripped and torn PHONE WIRE ...

Igniting a spark ...


EXT. DATA GROUP PARKING LOT - MORNING

Clay is driving away as the building behind him EXPLODES.


INT. EVERMORE ENTERPRISES - DAY

A YOUNG MAN - handsome, perfectly and tastefully groomed in a very nice suit sits doing paperwork at a large desk in a large office with a fantastic view of downtown Atlanta.

Off to one side, an OLDER MAN, also well-groomed, sits in a wing-back chair, reviewing some papers when the phone rings.

Annoyed, the young man picks it up.

DEREK EVERMORE
Yes, what is it?

He listens.

DEREK EVERMORE (CONT'D) A regional office? Why would they bother me with it? How did this call even make it this far?

He listens.	Then, face changing, he nods.

DEREK EVERMORE (CONT'D)
I see.	Put him through.

Pushing speaker-phone, he hangs up the handset.

DEREK EVERMORE (CONT'D)
This is Derek Evermore.
 
25.


PHONE
Uh, Mr. Evermore, Sir - very sorry to bother you Sir but - up, I’m Eric Garrett, the manager of one of your call-centers...?

DEREK EVERMORE
Yeah, Memphis, I got that.	What
happened?

PHONE
Well, it - um - seems we had a
disgruntled customer?

DEREK EVERMORE
So? So?? What fucking what? All of our so-called customers are disgruntled after we get done with them. Wait - is this line secure?

PHONE
I’m using the app.

DEREK EVERMORE
Okay, so why are you bothering me? We have an entire legal team that deals with this on a daily basis.

PHONE
Yes Sir, I appreciate that - but in this case, I don’t think a legal department will help here.

DEREK EVERMORE
(blinks/then)
Okay.	Okay.	Then what will?

PHONE
Um.	A fire department?

Evermore exchanges a sharp glance with the OLDER GENTLMAN in his office - who lowers the papers he’d been examining.

DEREK EVERMORE
I beg your pardon?

PHONE
Yeah. This dude just strolls in here this morning talking about, lying and stealing, sucker-punches a couple of my guys and ... and ...

DEREK EVERMORE
And - what?
 
26.


PHONE
Well, he burnt the place to the
ground.

DEREK EVERMORE
I’m sorry, he what?

PHONE
Yeah. I’m standing here looking at it now. A 37 million dollar building - burned right down to the foundation.

Derek and the Elder Man sit looking at one another.

DEREK EVERMORE
Do we know who this - disgruntled
customer - is?

PHONE
Uh.	No Sir.	He didn’t give a
name.

DEREK EVERMORE
I didn’t ask if he gave a name! I asked if you did your job and figured out who burned down my fucking building!?

PHONE
(cowed)

I ... I - well, I would - except - all of the surveillance cameras burned up in the fire and - well - I don’t know how to figure that out.

Derek Evermore sits there fuming.	The ELDER MAN speaks up.

ELDER MAN
What did you say your name was
again?

PHONE
Uh.	Garrett?	Sir.	Eric Garrett.

ELDER MAN
Well listen to me Eric Garrett.
Clearly this was a crime of
passion.	And passion indicates
spur of the moment action.
(MORE)
 
27.

ELDER MAN (CONT'D)
So what I highly suggest you do -
is go into our server up in the
cloud - and find out the last
‘deals’ we closed - and who they
were with.
(an eagle-eyed nod)
I suggest you start there.

There is a beat.

PHONE
Uh.	And then what?	If I figure
out who it was?

ELDER MAN
Then I suggest, using language that this person understands, help him to comprehend that these sorts of business practices won’t be tolerated by either Data Group or the larger Evermore Enterprises Ltd. Am I using language that you understand?

PHONE
Uh.	I think so?

ELDER MAN
Good.

And picking up the receiver, he lets it drop back down.
Looks to Evermore.	Shrugs.

ELDER MAN (CONT'D)
Cost of doing business, I suppose.


INT. VERONA LINCOLN’S APARTMENT - MORNING

There are no fewer than three bottles of Jack Daniels at various levels of emptiness in various spots around the room while, VERONA, mascara running down her face from crying, lies tangled in her sheets passed out when her phone rings.

It takes several rings before she even hears it. Waking in a sudden panic she digs around in the sheets till she locates it and presses it quickly to her ear.

VERONA
Yes?

PHONE
(a beat/then)
Ver?	You okay?
 
28.


VERONA
Yeah.	I’m great.	Why?

PHONE
(a beat/then)
Well.	Ah - your mother did pass
away last night?

VERONA
(remembering)
Oh ... yeah ... thanks for
reminding me.	Look - I ...

PHONE
Ver - it’s okay.	We’re all human
right?

VERONA
(a beat/then)
What’s going on?

PHONE
Remember Data Group?

VERONA
Yeah.	Of course ...

PHONE
Well - you better get there.


EXT. PARKING LOT - DATA GROUP - MEMPHIS - DAY

Verona stands with MATT WILEY, her partner from the local FBI Memphis Field Office. FIRE TRUCKS are spraying down the smoking remains of the once-beautiful steel and glass building.

Wiley refers to a group of FRIGHTENED-LOOKING PHONE-MARKETERS the police have gathered in one part of the parking lot.

WILEY
They’re the only witnesses. All the CCTV footage fried in the fire. Say some dude, maybe 40’s, walks in with a pair of gas cans, pissed off about something, burns the place to the ground.

VERONA
Did they say what he was pissed
about?

Wiley looks over at the tele-scammers.
