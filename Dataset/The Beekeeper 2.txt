WILEY
(sighs)
No.	Surprisingly, they say they
haven’t the foggiest idea.

VERONA
Fucking scumbags.
(building)
Well - this lightens our case-load
significantly.

WILEY
That it does.

VERONA
Plus - whoever did this?	My kind
of Samaritan.

WILEY
I heard that.	But you know Data
Group doesn’t just stop with this
one call-center right?

VERONA
(sighs)
Yeah.	But can I just enjoy the
moment please?

WILEY
(a slight smile)
Yeah - sure you can.	But when
you’re done celebrating, let’s go
interrogate these assholes?


EXT. ELOISE LINCOLN'S HOUSE - DAY

The house is quiet as a ‘71 MACH 1 MUSTANG rolls up on the country road that fronts it, big cam in the engine guttering.


INT. 71 MACH 1 MUSTANG - DAY

GARRETT looks out with FOUR OTHER MEN. Not the ones from the call-center. It looks like he up-graded - significantly.

They eye the house.

GARNETT
Last closed deal of the day?

The Driver consults his phone.
 
30.


DRIVER
Yeah.	Eloise Lincoln, 83.

Garrett eyes the house.

GARRETT
How much we take her for?

DRIVER
207.	African American and a widow.

Garrett studies the house another beat.

GARRETT
Well it definitely wasn’t any 83
year-old bitch who torched us.
Next.

MAN
Wait, what’s that?

He nods at a FIGURE in a head-to-toe HAZMAT-LIKE WHITE SUIT who is coming from some white cubicle structures behind a small house towards the back at the edge of the field.

ADAM CLAY removes the hood of his bee-keeping suit as he enters the back house.

GARRETT
Whaddaya know.	Bingo.


EXT. BACK HOUSE - DAY

With Garrett, the FOUR MEN, armed with PISTOLS and SHOTGUNS advance on the small back house.

One of them nods towards the back.

MAN 1
What’re those?

MAN 2
Bee hives.

GARRETT
Yeah. Asshole said something about bees. Guess he’s a bee-lover. Let’s announce our presence to Bee-Boy.

The others exchange a smirk. Step into a line in front of the hives - and KA-BOOM - blow four of the five to pieces.
 
31.


INT. KITCHEN - BACK HOUSE - DAY

CLAY is packing his kitchen goods into boxes when the explosions reach his ears. His eyes dart up.

The door behind him bursts open.

GARRETT
(stepping in)
Hiya Bee-Boy.

KABOOM!KABOOM! Clay dives over the counter as Two Gunmen with SHOTGUNS step in beside Garret and OPEN FIRE - blowing huge chunks out of the cabinetry as ...

SOMEHOW ...

Clay is suddenly coming at them from the side, grabbing hold of the hot barrels of BOTH SHOTGUNS as they swing them round toward him and...


Twisting them around, he ejects the shells with the guns’ lever-actions and as Garrett desperately swings a fist at him, he catches the man’s hand in between a lever-action and the gun body and - like a giant pair of scissors ...

Cuts Garrett’s fingers flying off - and as that man collapses screaming back out of the house, Clay ejects the assembly pin on both weapons, making them abruptly fall apart ...

Leaving him holding the two steel barrels - which he proceeds to hammer the living shit out of the two men with until ...

He stabs one directly into his first assailant’s rib-cage - and then the second thru the second’s throat, the ends of both barrels suddenly erupting with spouting blood as he turns ...

And grabs the next two men as they come charging up the stairs into the house, guns drawn ...

And disassembling their weapons within instants - Clay jams a RECEIVER smashing thru the teeth of the first attacker and, cramming it into his mouth, turns it sideways with the grip, forcing the man’s jaw wide open and then slams his head chin-first down onto the counter, forcing the business-end of the receiver up into his brain while he takes the ...

EJECTION SPRING of the second man’s gun and ducking behind him, extends it, wraps its steel wire round the man’s neck - and twists it together - leaving the man strangling, gasping, purple and kicking on his kitchen floor as he ...
 
32.


Moves immediately to pack a GO-BAG to get the fuck out of there.


No sooner than the man strangling on his floor gives his final gasp and his legs drum his kitchen floor in a death rattle than is Adam Clay - the Bee Keeper - already stepping over him, bag in hand, headed out the door.


EXT. PARKING LOT - DATA GROUP - DAY

VERONA is questioning one of the group of Tele-Scammers.

VERONA
Uh-huh.	And so, I’m confused.
People - generally elderly - call
you because a warning with your
phone number appears on their
screen - and you have no idea how
it got there?

TELE-SCAMMER
No.	Look - I mean - I ... look I
just work phones, okay?

VERONA
And then they just send your company big chunks of money? Let’s be frank - sometimes all of their money? Just because of your winning phone personality?

Wrapping his arms around himself, the Tele-Scammer stares at his feet, rocking from one foot to another.

TELE-SCAMMER
Data Group has attorneys that deal with this sort of thing. I’d like to talk to one of them.

VERONA
I’m sure you would and you will.
(a smile)
Cock-fuck.

TELE-SCAMMER
Wait - what’d you call me?

VERONA
Cock-fuck.	But come to think of
it, that’s an insult to women.	So
how about pig-fuck?	Or dog-fuck?
Or corpse-fuck.	Or how about plain
old piece of rancid dog shit?
(MORE)
 
33.

VERONA (CONT'D)
(adds)
You cock-fuck.

VOICE
Uh, Verona?

She looks.	Wiley.

WILEY
When you’re done violating this
gentleman’s civil rights - can I
speak to you for a moment?


EXT. PARKING LOT - DATA GROUP - DAY

A few yards away, Wiley turns to face Verona.

WILEY
How’s your day?

VERONA
Apart from my mother’s suicide last night?


WILEY
Sorry.	I meant...

VERONA
I know, I know - I’m an asshole.
Well it started out pretty shitty
but ...
(burned building)
Hey.	It’s looking up.

WILEY
So you like fires?

VERONA
Today I do.

WILEY
Well then today’s your lucky day.
(nods)
Cause apparently your mom’s house
is on fire too.
(shrugs)
And some other shit.


EXT. ELOISE LINCOLN'S HOUSE - TUPELO, MS -DAY

Verona and Wiley stand in the street - watching as fire
trucks douse the BACK HOUSE that is in FLAMES ...
 
34.


And PARAMEDICS wheel BODIES out under white sheets.

VERONA
Is any of them the bee-guy? Do we know?

WILEY
Doesn’t look that way. In fact, it looks like its everyone but the bee-guy. How you liking his style now?

Verona looks at the body under a sheet passing by them.

There is the large shape of the SHOTGUN BARREL that Clay stabbed into the guy’s chest sticking up under the sheet.

VERONA
More and more all the time.
(Wiley)
But ... ?

Wiley nods and waves a nearby POLICE OFFICER over - who hands him a small square object.

WILEY
Yeah.	They found this on one of
the bodies.

She looks.	It’s a SECURITY ID.	It says, DATA GROUP Ltd.

WILEY (CONT'D)
Verona - do you think there’s even the remotest chance - that the dude that burned Data Group to the ground this morning ...
(house)

Was the guy renting the back house from your mother?

Verona blinks at him.

VERONA
The Bee-Keeper?


INT. ‘71 MACH 1 MUSTANG - DAY

BLEEDING all over himself, RIGHT HAND, fingers amputated, GARRETT drives with his left hand while holding his RIGHT with its chopped fingers scrunched into his shirt against his belly, whinging and panting as he pulls over and...

Fumbling out his phone he tries to dial, but without fingers, just ends up smearing blood all over the touch-screen.
 
35.


Instead, easing the car to the side of the road on a bridge, he switches the phone to his mangled hand and manages to hold and position it while he dials with his good hand.


INT. OFFICE - EVERMORE ENTERPRISES - DAY

The phone rings on Derek’s desk and he snatches it up.

DEREK EVERMORE
Yes?
(then)
Put him through.

Hitting speaker, he drops the phone back onto the receiver. WESTWYLD - the SOPHISTICATED ELDER MAN - glances briefly up from the documents he’s reviewing.

DEREK EVERMORE (CONT'D)
I’m here. What do you have to say
to me?

PHONE
(a beat/then)
Uh.	Mr. Evermore...

DEREK EVERMORE
Wait. Are you doing coke?

PHONE
What??

DEREK EVERMORE
You’re sniffing. You’re sniveling. Like you’ve got a nose full of snot. Are you doing coke? Are you doing fucking cocaine and calling me??

PHONE
Uh. No Sir, Mr. Evermore ... I do do cocaine occasionally but ...

DEREK EVERMORE
Then what are you doing??

PHONE
I’m - bleeding - Mr. Evermore.

Evermore looks to WESTWYLD.	Who arches a brow back.

DEREK EVERMORE
Bleeding like - what?	You have a
tooth removed or something?
 
36.


PHONE
Um.	No Sir.	My fingers. On my
right hand.

DEREK EVERMORE
I’m - what?	Sorry?

PHONE
My fingers.	On my right hand.
They’re gone.	He cut them off.
With the lever-action of a shotgun.

Now Evermore and Westwyld really look at one another.

DEREK EVERMORE
Who - is ... he?

PHONE
Do you have a tv?

DEREK EVERMORE
You mean like a flat-screen?

PHONE
Yeah.	Turn it on.

Derek looks to Westwyld. Picking up a remote, he flicks on the giant flatscreen behind his desk. It’s on CNN already and the first image - is that of BODIES being hauled out of a rural house that’s partially on fire.

WESTWYLD
Hold on.	Pause that ...

Evermore does. Rising, the older man goes to the screen - examines it. Indicates a blurry WHITE SQUARE visible towards the back of the image off to the right.

WESTWYLD (CONT'D)
What is that?

EVERMORE
(squints)

I dunno. It looks like ... a bee-hive - or something. Why? What does it matter?

PHONE
Uh. Yeah. It was a bee-hive. We fucked up the rest real good ...
(weak laugh)
But, yeah, he said something about that...
 
37.


Westwyld is instantly at the phone.

WESTWYLD
Said something about what?

PHONE
About what what?

WESTWYLD
About fucking bees you fucking
moron!

PHONE
(a shocked pause/then)

Well he said - I dunno - like - he was talking bee shit.

WESTWYLD
What kind of ‘bee-shit’?

PHONE
I dunno.	Like - how to protect
them.	The bees.

Westwyld stands.	Staring at the phone.

WESTWYLD
So - you’re saying - to me - to us -
that this man - whose home you
rolled into - who cut your fingers
off...

PHONE
(interjects)
And killed the other four guys I
was with ...

WESTWYLD
(closes his eyes/then)

And killed the other 4 individuals you were with - he was a Bee-Keeper?

PHONE
Yeah.	It would seem that way
but...


INT. ‘71 MACH 1 MUSTANG - DAY

In the Mach 1, Garrett suddenly goes flying as CLAY smashes
the window in with his fist and reaching in...
 
38.


GARRETT
(shrieks!)
Hey! Bro! No!

... shoves a COME-ALONG STRAP down around his torso and, yanking it’s ratchet-cam tight, turns and walks back to his TRUCK - which Garrett had not noticed during the phone-call that Clay had parked facing his car ...

Pausing to pull SEVERAL QUARTS OF HONEY out of the back and toss them thru the Mach 1’s open passenger window, he ...

Reaches in thru the pickup’s driver’s window, slaps it in gear and steps back as the truck rolls forward and ...

GARRETT (CONT'D)
Bro!	Bro No!	Bro!

... crashes thru the railing and goes plummeting away into the country river below ...

Come-along - attached to the trailer-hitch - whipping its cable away after it ...

YANKING Garrett ripping out of the driver’s side window and vanishing sucking away over the railing of the bridge after the truck and smashing down into the river below.

Getting into the Mach 1, Clay punches the tunnel-mount gear-box and, fishtailing across the bridge, goes blasting away down the country road.



INT. OFFICE - EVERMORE ENTERPRISES - DAY

EVERMORE and WESTWYLD sit/stand - frozen - not sure what they just heard.

INTERCUT:

Clay fishes up Garrett’s bloody PHONE off the floor.

CLAY
Who is this?

Evermore and Westwyld look at one another.

EVERMORE
(leaning angrily)

Fuck you. You burned down a multi-million dollar facility of mine you fucking cunt!
 
39.


CLAY
That stole from people. And now I’m going to burn you down. What’s your name?

EVERMORE
Fuck. You. Who are you? You’re nothing? You’re some bee-keeping hick from the ... from the sticks! You don’t burn me down! I burn you down!

CLAY
What’s your name?

EVERMORE
Oh, and you have a hearing problem? My name is ‘Fuck! You!’ My name is I’m going to make it my personal hobby for the next three hours to make you suffer and die.

CLAY
You sound young. You probably don’t have Estate Planning, am I right?

EVERMORE
What?

CLAY
Estate planning. Like a will? What’s going to happen to your belongings after you’re gone? You don’t have that, I’m assuming?

EVERMORE
I’m 28 fucking years old!	Why
would I!?!

CLAY
You’re about to find out.

He terminates the line.


INT. OFFICE - EVERMORE ENTERPRISES - DAY

Evermore stares at the phone.

EVERMORE
The fuck’s that supposed to mean
Shit-face??	What the fuck’s that
supposed to mean?!?
 
40.


Realizing he’s been hung up on, he grabs the phone and begins...


EVERMORE (CONT'D)
What the fuck’s that supposed to
mean you shit-prick!!!

... smashing it on the desk. Until Westwyld, lays a hand over his. Evermore stops, panting - looking at the older man.

EVERMORE (CONT'D)
What?

Westwyld looks back at him.

WESTWYLD
(finally)
The ‘what’ is - you’ve fucked up.
(nods)
Even worse than usual this time.

EVERMORE
(blinks back)
Fucked up??	Me??	How did I fuck
up.

Westwyld takes in a deep breath. Holds it. Lets it out, very, very - very - slowly.

WESTWYLD
He’s a Bee-Keeper.

EVERMORE
What?	What?	He keeps bees?	So
what??

WESTWYLD
No.	You don’t understand.	He’s a
Bee Keeper.

Evermore stares back, brain convoluting.

EVERMORE
You’re right.	You’re right!	I
don’t understand.	What does that
even fucking mean!

WESTWYLD
(another breath)

It means - I’m going to have a very hard time keeping both you - and myself - alive - for very much longer.
 
41.


INT. CORRIDOR - EVERMORE ENTERPRISES - DAY

Westwyld is moving fast down the corridor with Evermore hot on his heels.

EVERMORE
What?	What?	Wait?	Bees?	Bee-
Keeper?? What the fuck are you
talking about??

Turning on his heel, Westwyld heads directly into ...


INT. WESTWYLD’S OFFICE - DAY

... his office where he immediately and commandingly takes a seat behind his desk.

WESTWYLD
(Evermore)
Shut the door.

Evermore blinks at him.

WESTWYLD (CONT'D)
Shut the fucking door you over-
privileged idiot!

Somewhat cowed, Evermore obeys. Westwyld closes his eyes a moment. Then, composed, he picks up the phone.

WESTWYLD (CONT'D)
Brenda - get me the Secretary.
(a beat/then)
Yes.	That Secretary.

He drums his fingers, looking angrily at Evermore while he waits. Then ...

WESTWYLD (CONT'D)
Mr. Secretary.	Sorry to be
bothering you - but you know, if I
am - it’s important so ...

WE SEE: CLAY behind the wheel of the Mach 1, tearing down the freeway.


WESTWYLD (O.S.) (CONT'D) Yes Sir, well - how should I put this - well, one of my charges has - oh jesus - this is awkward - well, somehow he both located and came at cross-purposes with a - ahm ...

(MORE)
 
42.

WESTWYLD (O.S.) (CONT'D)
(gets it over with)
A Bee Keeper.

PHONE
(a beat/then)
Someone - who keeps bees?

WESTWYLD
Yes.	And also a ‘Bee Keeper’ as
well.	If you get my meaning.

PHONE
(a beat)
A Bee Keeper ... ?

WESTWYLD
Yes.

PHONE
As in a ‘Bee Keeper’ bee keeper?

WESTWYLD
Yes.

PHONE
Are you saying ... that he’s -
angered the hive?

WESTWYLD
That’s what I’m saying.	Severely
pissed it off might be a better
term.

PHONE
(a long beat/then)
Well.	That’s not good.

WESTWYLD
No shit.

WE SEE: CLAY placing items at the register in a BAIT AND TACKLE SHOP. Paying for HIGH-TEST FISHING LINE.

There is another long beat.	Then a chuckle.

PHONE
Well then Clarence - this ‘charge’ of yours and you - I assume you’re working on funeral arrangements?

WESTWYLD
That is not a fucking productive
statement Wallace!
(MORE)
 
43.

WESTWYLD (CONT'D)
I’ve got a serious fucking problem here and I need help!

PHONE
(a beat of silence)

Okay. Yeah. I can see that. That you need help, I mean. But what’s it got to do with me.

WESTWYLD
(acid)

What it has to do with you, Wallace, is the same thing it had to do with you when your campaign asked me, slash-’us’, for help. Money help. What it has to do with is - when you asked for help - I-slash-’we’ - were there.

PHONE
Yeah - but Clarence. This sounds
like just a one-in-a-million
lightning strike of bad luck. What
can I do?

WESTWYLD
(a quiet sigh)

This Bee Keeper lives in Tupelo, Mississippi. I need, simply, to know the name of the Bee-Keeper in Mississippi. And how to find him. Before he finds me. `
(adds)
Slash-’us’.

PHONE
(a hesitation/then)
Clarence - this is high-level shit.
Like, treason.	I can’t do that.

WESTWYLD
Like I - slash-’we’ - couldn’t donate 5 million fucking dollars to your campaign?

PHONE
(another beat/then)
You said ‘his’ name?

WESTWYLD
I did.
 
44.


PHONE
Well then - I can tell you - in
that case - ‘he’s’ not the active
Bee Keeper for that state.	This
person must be moth-balled -
retired.

WESTWYLD
Well then give me the last Bee
Keeper’s name!!

PHONE
(yet another beat)
Clarence, I appreciate all you’ve
done for me - but that’s a line
even I can’t cross.	You realize
right, I start revealing the name
of the Bee Keepers - you realize
the kind of problem that could
create?
(then)
But what I can say - is this ...
(a breath)

It sounds like this individual is creating a certain amount of chaos?

WESTWYLD
For me and those I have a fiduciary responsibility to, yes!

PHONE
Well then - what I can do in that
case, within the boundaries of my
duty as a public servant ...

There is the longest beat.

PHONE (CONT'D)
Is to activate the current Bee
Keeper in that state - to address
the problem.

Westwyld sits a minute staring at the phone.	Then nods.

WESTWYLD
That would be most appreciated
Wallace.	You fucking asshole.

He slams the phone down. Looks to Evermore - who is staring back.


EVERMORE
What the fuck is going on??
 
45.


WESTWYLD
Oh, shut up you fucking idiot.

Getting up, he pushes past the younger man and exits.


INT. TRUCK STOP FOOD MART - NIGHT

Clay heads out of the Bait-And-Tackle with his purchases into the adjoining truck Food-Mart.

He pauses - then returns to an aisle - peruses the HONEY they have for sale there. Picks up a bottle, examines its contents closely. Holds it up to the light.

Abruptly, A WOMAN ...

A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN, in sunglasses, a short purple
polyurethane coat, and a DRUM MAGAZINE MACHINE-GUN ...

Walks in, shooting first the CASHIER - then, in rapid succession, FIVE TRUCKERS who are either waiting in line or sitting eating ...


Before she turns to the store.

ANISETTE LANDRESS
Honey!	I’m home!

And proceeds to shoot the living fuck out of the aisles.

CLAY in the aisle with honey takes a knee as high-caliber BULLETS tear thru everything around him - cereal and cookie debris raining down on him.

A moment later, everything goes silent as she quickly ejects one drum magazine to slap in another.

CLAY
(standing)
I’m assuming you’re my replacement?

ANISETTE LANDRESS You’d assume correctly. And from what I hear - the ‘buzz’ is you’ve been a busy bee. Causing all sorts of trouble.

CLAY
Well, you know - us bees - we don’t think too much - we just do what we were made to do.
(nods)
That’s why it all works.
 
46.


ANISETTE LANDRESS
Well apparently it’s not working.
Which is why I activated.	Or got
activated.

CLAY
And I reactivated.	Because
something was broken.

ANISETTE LANDRESS
You were retired.	Why can’t you
just ‘mind your own beeswax’?

CLAY
Very cute.	Buzz off.

ANISETTE LANDRESS
I intend to.	After I make you
‘beehave’.

She OPENS FIRE, ripping the shelves to shreds as the entire truck stop goes up into a Fallujah of flying carbohydrates and debris as Clay ...


Begins winging QUARTS OF HONEY over the tops of the shelves...

Exploding in glass and honey all around her. She frowns, more annoyed than bothered, as she stops to change drum magazines with expert precision and speed - which is when...

CLAY comes rolling out of the aisles and nails her first with one quart of honey, glass shattering against her skull, sending HONEY drizzling all over her ...

And the next explodes off her gun, drenching her - and her gun in its viscous golden fluid. She looks down - appalled.

ANISETTE LANDRESS (CONT'D) Do you!? Do you have any idea what this coat cost me!?! At a vintage clothing shop!?! That’s not even open anymore!?!

CLAY
Golly.	I ‘hive’ no idea.

ANISETTE LANDRESS
Well - aren’t you just the bees
knees?	Now - time to flame off.

And raising the gun, she pulls the trigger to cut him in half - only - soaked in HONEY, the gun’s hammer tries ...
 
47.


like an insect trapped in amber - to fall on the firing pin of the next bullet ...

But slogged into a syrupy slow-motion by the thick golden nectar - it cannot effectively strike.

CLAY
Hey.	You know what else’s
flammable?

Pulling one of the HARLEY DAVIDSON LIGHTERS off the counter display rack beside them, he flicks it to life. Smiles.

CLAY (CONT'D)
You.
(shrugs)
Honey.

And tosses it into the HIGHLY FLAMMABLE pool of HONEY that she stands in - sending her up like a roman candle, screaming and smashing from the counter to the shelves, leaving traces of BURNING HONEY everywhere she touches.

Seriously folks - this shit is like gasoline.

Clay picks up his purchases and ...

CLAY (CONT'D)
Careful Hon. Looks like you got a bee in your bonnet.

... exits past the burning, screaming, dying woman.


INT. OFFICE - SAVANAH FBI FIELD OFFICE - DAY

AGENT VERONA LINCOLN sits in her office snapping her attention back and forth between written records and her computer when WILEY enters.

She looks up eagerly.

VERONA
Okay.	This dude?	Adam Clay?	He
doesn’t freaking exist.

WILEY
Who?	The Bee Keeper?
 
48.


VERONA
The Bee Keeper. I ran his prints thru the Federal database and every state DMV database in the country - and computerized birth records for any male in his age range.
(shakes head)
So far as I can tell - no such
dude.	He doesn’t exist.

WILEY
Sure he does.

VERONA
(blinks)
What do you mean?

WILEY
Remember how I said - if you liked fires today was your lucky day?


EXT. TRUCK STOP - MISSISSIPPI-TENNESSEE BORDER - DAY

Both Verona and Wiley stand stone-faced outside the burned-out remnants of the truck-stop, fire-trucks and police still present everywhere.

WILEY
Ready for the kicker?

VERONA
No, I don’t think I am Wiley.

WILEY
It’s apparently arson - in other
words, set by man - and the
accelerant apparently used?
(a nod)
Honey.

She looks at him.

VERONA
There’s just no way.

He raises and shows her his phone.

WILEY
Yes. Way. This place’s closed-circuit was stored in the cloud rather than on-site so it didn’t go up in smoke like everything else.
 
49.


He presses play.

WILEY (CONT'D)
And this is what we got.

She watches as the one-sided gun-battle plays out between Anisette Landress and Clay. After he sets her on fire and walks out, Wiley clicks it off.

WILEY (CONT'D)
Thoughts?	Reflections?

VERONA
Uh.	Nice jacket.	Big gun.

WILEY
Name pulled off the registration
from the car she drove here ...
(he nods to it)
‘Anisette Landress’.

Verona looks over to the INSECT GREEEN ‘70 Chevelle still parked in the lot.


EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

Stopping at the back of the car, they open the trunk. Inside, it is WALL-TO-WALL guns, neatly arranged in custom slings. Verona blinks.

VERONA
That’s a chain-gun.	A Vulcan
cannon.

WILEY
I know.

VERONA
It shoots 6000 rounds a minute.

WILEY
I know.

VERONA
That’s 60 rounds a second.

WILEY
I know.	I have a degree in math.

VERONA
You know a lot.
 
50.


WILEY
I know.

VERONA
So then do you also know who
Anisette Landress is?

WILEY
Yes, I do.

VERONA
Who?

WILEY
Someone who also doesn’t exist in
any DMV or Federal database.
Someone who’s also a ghost.	Like
our good friend Adam Clay.

She looks back at him.	Then reaching into the trunk, she...

VERONA
There’s another way it seems like Anisette Landress and our Adam Clay are alike ...


... digs out a BOOK and holds it up. ‘BEE KEEPING FOR BEE KEEPERS’. They look at one another.

VERONA (CONT'D)
What the fuck’s going on Wiley?

WILEY
Okay.	I admit it.	This time I’m
stumped.

She looks at him. Looks one way down the freeway the truck-stop sits on.

VERONA
You know what’s that way?

WILEY
The small town your mother and Adam
Clay lived in?

She looks the other.

VERONA
You know what’s that way? The way he’s headed?

WILEY
Atlanta, Georgia?
 
51.


VERONA
Right.	You know what’s there?

He blinks back a second.	Then, his face changes.

WILEY
Oh.	Yeah.	I kinda do.


INT. CAR - DAY

Wiley drives while, Verona sits in the passenger, the BOOK ON BEE-KEEPING on her lap while, on hold, her phone hangs at her ear.

VERONA
(Wiley)
This is interesting stuff.	Bees
are interesting little fucks, did
you know that?

WILEY
I know they pollinate a lot of shit and we’d be fucked without them.

VERONA
Right. And there’s been massive die-off’s in the bee-hives in this country lately. No one knows why. The hives - which are obviously very complicated organizations of social creatures, are very delicate eco-systems. But nonetheless...
(reading)

‘In a palace intrigue worthy of Game of Thrones, some bees are ‘QueenSlayers’ who will rise up and kill their queen if she produces the wrong sort of male offspring.’

WILEY
Which sounds like it pretty much
fucks the hive.

VERONA
It can. But it appears in that case, if the hive is lucky enough to have a Bee-Keeper, he - or she - can replace the dead queen with a new, better one. Problem solved.
 
52.


WILEY
Very interesting. But what the fuck’s it got to do with what we’re doing Verona?


She looks at him.	Shrugs.

VERONA
I dunno.	I just thought it was
interesting.
(into phone)
Ah!	Johnny.	My spooky spook
spook.

PHONE
Ah - I don’t think we use that term
anymore.

VERONA
Why?	Are you black?

PHONE
You know I’m not.

VERONA
So I can call you that. You can’t call me that - but I can call you it. See how it works?

PHONE
Uh, not really. What can I do for you Verona? I only hear from you when you need me.

VERONA
See?	Just answered your own
question.	I need you.

PHONE
For.

VERONA
John.	What fuck is a Bee Keeper?

PHONE
Uh.	Some dude who keeps bees?

VERONA
Women keep bees too.	In fact,
according to a book I’m reading,
there are more female bee keepers
than male in America.
 
53.


PHONE
Fascinating. Okay, a non-gendered individual who keeps bees.

VERONA
No. I mean a Bee Keeper.

PHONE
That’s what I was talking about. A bee keeper.

VERONA
(deadly serious)

No John - a Bee Keeper. Someone who doesn’t have a real name, doesn’t seem to exist and seems to kill anyone and anything that comes at him - or her - at will.

There is a beat.

PHONE
Oh.	You mean a Bee Keeper.

VERONA
(a sigh)

That’s what I’ve been saying. What the hell is it? Or better - who is it?

PHONE
I understand the question now.

VERONA
Great.	So who is it?

PHONE
I can’t tell you.

VERONA
John. We help each other. Remember?

PHONE
I do. But this one thing? I can’t help you with.

VERONA
(thinks/then)
Because it’s classified?

PHONE
That, in itself, would be
classified.
 
54.


VERONA
So it’s ... so classified? That even the fact that it’s classified - is classified?

PHONE
That - also - is classified.

She blinks at the dashboard a moment.

VERONA
So it’s a program?

PHONE
Classified.

VERONA
Of people ... ?

PHONE
Double-classified.

VERONA
Called Bee-Keepers ...

PHONE
Oh looky - someone bought me a
birthday cake!	Gotta go!

VERONA
But it’s not even your...

The line goes dead. Verona looks over at Wiley. He looks back at her. Shrugs.

WILEY
I’m getting this weird feeling it
might be classified?

WESTWYLD (PRE-LAP)
A fucking Bee-Keeper - is a fucking code-name!


INT. EVERMORE ENTERPRISES - DAY

WESTWYLD faces a ROOM OF MEN, all who appear to be ex-Special Forces now working high-level security ops.

On a massive screen, CCTV FOOTAGE from the Truck-Stop shootout is playing. Derek Evermore also sits - dejectedly - at the table.
 
55.


WESTWYLD
For a program that was developed back when I was running the Central Intelligence Agency. You see, this fucked country we live in is not unlike a bee-hive. A complex interconnection of workers, care-takers and even royalty. An extremely highly interconnected social eco-system that the people in it think runs all by itself.

(shakes his head)
But it obviously doesn’t. Every now and then some exogenous factor occurs - sometimes human, sometimes natural disaster - that makes the whole thing - the whole hive, if you will, go off the rails.

(he nods)
That’s where the Bee Keepers come into play. There was one placed in every state of the union. 50. Recruited from anywhere the person with the right skills - and more importantly - the right mind-set - could be found. Didn’t even have to be America. Anywhere in the world. That person’s identity was then washed and dry-cleaned at a level that even I did not know who was where - or where they came from. Absolute and perfect anonymity - and with a single purpose.


He nods again.

WESTWYLD (CONT'D)
Normally, nothing.	But when one
thing - any one thing - whether act
of terror or act of nature - raised
its ugly head to disturb the
equilibrium of the hive - the Bee
Keeper would step in and do
whatever was necessary to correct
it.	And I stress: whatever was
necessary.	Like with the hives,
the Bee Keepers are the invisible
hand of God that keep chaos at bay -
and order in society

He nods.
 
56.


WESTWYLD (CONT'D)
There are 50 active Bee-Keepers and an equal number of retired ones on post out there. And it appears one of the retired ones has resurfaced - and is acting according to what he believes his social program to be.

The room exchanges a glance.

SEC-OP1
So why doesn’t someone just pick up the phone - and order this bumble-bee headed asshole to stand-down.

WESTWYLD
Because that’s one thing Bee Keepers don’t do - stand down. That’s the whole point. They’re not unlike the bees themselves. They’re on a program. They have a job? They do it till they die - no questions asked, none tolerated.

SEC-OP1
So basically he’s ex-special ops - like most of us. Just off the reservation.

WESTWYLD
No. Not like most of you. There is a difference. Most of you are either ex-SEAL Team 6 or Army Rangers or Airborne. You are, in other words, pussies. He is not a pussy. In a room, he will kill you. All of you. You will not kill him. This is a difference.
(a shrug)
But maybe - there’s a chance - that in a small enough room - if there’s a lot more of you - you may be able to, in fact, kill him before he can accomplish his goal.

SEC-OP 2
Which is - what?

WESTWYLD
To kill the people who matter!

Straightening, he touches the screen of his phone and they pull out all of theirs as they ping.
 
57.


WESTWYLD (CONT'D)
That’s where we think he’s going.
(glances at watch)
That flight is 1 hour 11 minutes on our jet from here - I suggest you get moving.



INT. CAR - INTERSTATE - DAY

WILEY drives as VERONA sits in the passenger, still reading from the Book on Bees as she waits on hold on her phone.

VERONA
Here’s another interesting factoid.

WILEY
Oh thank god.	I was getting sick
of just enjoying my own peaceful
thoughts.

VERONA
This book observes that the bee hive is this massive organization of individuals all working together towards a common goal, but when the lid comes off and this white-suited dude lifts out the frames of honey - or does whatever he does - they don’t even see him. They don’t even register that he’s there.

Only that - sometimes - something’s changed.

She looks up at him.

VERONA (CONT'D)
It’s almost like ... God ... or karma ... a force that guides all of our destinies that we don’t even realize is there - is doing it.

WILEY
My recommendation? Quit the FBI immediately and get your doctorate in theology.

VERONA
Noted. I will absolutely consider that.


WILEY
You know this isn’t really our
department, right?
 
58.


VERONA
Yeah it is. Any parallel case that develops out of something we’re investigating becomes, in part, our case. Or something to that effect.

WILEY
You know what - I was wrong about
theology.	Stick with the FBI.

VERONA
Too late now.	You got me thinking.
(into her phone)
Yes, yes - this is Verona Lincoln, Mr. Deputy Director. I and my colleague who is on speaker are agents out of the Memphis office...
(listens)
Yes, we believe that 3 apparently
unconnected events, two of which
resulted in multiple deaths are
connected to a single person ...


EXT. FIELD - LATE DAY

The MACH 1 pulls to a halt in the grass of a field of flowers beautiful in the late rays of day, the silhouettes of hundreds of bees traveling from flower to flower as CLAY steps out.

VERONA’S VOICE
We’re not sure what his real name is but he signed a rental agreement with my mother a year ago under the name ‘Adam Clay’ ...

He stops at a series of a dozen or so BEE HIVES, locus of the buzzing swarms of bees. They pay him little mind as he lifts one of the lids and, like an organ player, lifts a particular combination of frames ...

And the whole white hive drops back open, revealing a ROUGH CONCRETE STAIRCASE descending down into darkness below.

VERONA’S VOICE (CONT'D) It appears he could be part of a defunct or operational government program called ‘Bee Keeper’ that no one in our partner agencies seems to want to acknowledge or discuss. In any event, this individual seems to be highly capable ...
 
59.


Clay descends down into the darkness, and flicking on a light, reveals a small room that is SIMPLY PACKED WITH GUNS AND WEAPONRY.

VERONA’S VOICE (CONT'D)
... not to mention extremely
motivated.

Pulling down a COLLAPSIBLE POLICE BATON, he snaps it open.

On it’s pencil eraser steel tip - a bristling of TINY NEEDLES.


Snapping it closed, he begins pulling WEAPONS down off the walls.


VERONA’S VOICE (CONT'D) And the thing is, Sir - he’s on the move. We don’t think he’s done yet.

EMERGING out from the underground bunker, Clay drops the honey-bee hive back down, sealing the entrance - and stands a moment in the fading light of day, holding a LARGE DUFFLE BAG.

The bees buzz swarming around him, almost as if he is a kind of religious icon to them. And he seems to bask in it, both in the gloaming’s light - and the feeling of the thousands of infinitesimal wing-beats around him.

VERONA’S VOICE (CONT'D)
There’s a statewide police APB on
him, but we don’t think he’s in
Tennessee anymore.	We think he’s
on his way to Georgia or already
there.

Opening the trunk of the Mach 1, Clay swings the heavy duffel bag into it and slaps it shut.

VERONA’S VOICE (CONT'D) Sir, we believe he is on the way to the corporate offices of Data Group

-	which myself and my partner have been investigating for massive interstate fraud for some time now. Point is Sir, we think he’s headed there and because Data Group operates late into the night hours, because it works telephones all the way to the West Coast and Hawaii, we believe when he gets there his intentions are going to be less than salutatory for those present.
