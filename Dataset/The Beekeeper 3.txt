Stepping into the Mach 1, Clay fires the engine, and, gently rolls across the grass and pulls out onto the country road.

VERONA’S VOICE (CONT'D) We’re presently en-route. But we think when we get there - we’re going to need support. A lot of it.

With the scream of the big-block 421, Clay crushes the accelerator and the car goes fish-tailing across the road and disappearing roaring away down the country road.


EXT. DATA GROUP CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS - ATLANTA - EVENING

FIVE VANS come skidding up to the beautiful glass and steel entrance of this nationwide conglomerate, TWO DOZEN MEN jumping out - most of them in suits, the remaining half-dozen in TACTICAL GEAR.

The GUNS of the men in suits come out immediately in the direction of the other men in tactical gear.

FEDERAL AGENT
Federal Officers!	Identify
yourself!

SEC-OP1 (PETTY)
Power down Federal friend.	We’re
private security hired by Data
Group, here legally by special
order of the Governor ...
(hands him a document)
And licensed to carry by special
order of the State Department in
all 50 states.

He flashes the ID clipped to his flak-vest.

SEC-OP1 (PETTY) (CONT'D) Call it in, if you need, but we’re entering this building and securing the executive floor.

And without waiting for the surprised Feds to respond, he and his five ex-Special Forces operatives head into the building.
 
61.


INT. EXECUTIVE FLOOR - 10TH FLOOR - DATA GROUP - NIGHT

A kind of Boiler Room, the floor bustling, people working phones everywhere as one man - clearly running the show stands at the top of the room with a MICROPHONE in hand at a large ERASE-BOARD, quickly writing NUMBERS next to CITIES on it.

HALPERN
(calling out)
Houston!

One of the Young Men in shirt and ties in the room working a phone and computer shouts back.

MAN WITH TIE
122,000 for the day - but they’re
open another two hours.

HALPERN writes that number - 122 - next to ‘Houston’.

HALPERN
Update me if more comes in from
that location.	Chicago!

2ND MAN IN TIE
179 thousand.	Open another hour.

HALPERN
(writes it on board)

Keep me updated. Come on people, we have goals to meet! Goals mean bonuses. Push! Your! Goddam! Regional Offices!

The doors fly open and PETTY enters with his FIVE SECURITY OPERATIVES.

HALPERN (CONT'D)
Who the fuck are you?

PETTY
We’re your security. No one called you?


HALPERN
Oh. Yeah. They called - but you’re security, you’re not supposed to be up here - you’re supposed to be guarding the place. This space is for business.
 
62.


PETTY
Not tonite it’s not. You’re shutting down and you and everyone else is getting out of here.

HALPERN
Like fuck I am. We’ve got three more hours of money-making left on the clock and we are not going anywhere. Parent company didn’t say anything about shutting off the spigot.

PETTY
Yeah well, when I’m on the ground, I’m in charge - and you are leaving.

HALPERN
(the room)
Anybody so much as puts a phone
down, they’re fired.

Petty glares at him a second.

PETTY
Hey.	That your office down there? (jerks head)
Come with me.


INT. HALPERN’S OFFICE - NIGHT

Entering Halpern’s office at the top of the sales room, Petty turns to Halpern.

PETTY
Listen idiot - did Parent Company give you any picture of what might be coming at you tonight?

HALPERN
No. They just said - disgruntled customer - something like that. No big deal. We’ve seen plenty.

PETTY
Not like this disgruntled customer you haven’t. And guess what? If this ‘disgruntled customer’ manages to get through the Feds posted outside? Your entire evening, if not your entire life, is about to get disgruntled.
 
63.


EXT. ENTRANCE - DATA GROUP CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

The HEAD of the 12-man Federal operation massed at the entrance, is going over building blue-prints on an Ipad.

CROENENBERG (FED HEAD)
What about the parking garage?

FEDERAL AGENT 1
Closed and locked.	Steel gate.

CROENENBERG
Delivery dock?

FEDERAL AGENT 1
Same.

CROENENBERG
Okay - there’s gotta be other back
entrances to this place - and trust
me, he’s going to find and try to
use them - so we gotta find them
first.	There’s no way he’s gonna
to try to come in here straight
through the teeth of the dragon.

VOICE
There are no other entrances.

They turn to see CLAY standing there. They blink an instant. Briefly, Croenenberg flashes the badge that hangs around his neck.

CROENENBERG
(brisk/dismissive)

Federal operation in progress. Move along or at minimum retreat to a safe distance and stay there. Thank you.

He starts to turn back to the device-screen with the agent.

CLAY
The other option, obviously, instead of going in, is to get them to come out.


Croenenberg and his agent turn again to him.	Frown.

CROENENBERG
What’d you say?
 
64.


CLAY
(shrugs)
But I figured I’d give the
firefighters a break.	I’ve put
them through enough today.

The two Federal Agents blink at him again.

CROENENBERG
What’d you say your name was?

CLAY
I didn’t.	And I won’t.	But
currently I go by the name ‘Adam
Clay’.

They stare at him another blinking moment.

CLAY (CONT'D)
Trust me - if there were a back entrance, I would have used it, because I don’t want to in any way injure anyone’s who’s innocent or non-involved ...

(a shrug/nods)
But it is what it is.

Abruptly, they go for their guns - but he is there first ...

The TELESCOPING BATON in his hand snapping open as he swats Croenenberg across the face.

It’s just the lightest touch - but as Croenenberg, surprised, reaches to touch his face, a small grouping of PINPRICKS OF BLOOD arise on the skin on his cheek.

His eyes snap, angered, to Clay ...

CROENENBERG
... why you mother...

But then - suddenly - eyes going blank - he drops.

And the rest of the Agents massed there - all come at Clay, who responds in kind - ducking, dodging and batting them with the baton ...


Each touch of it, no matter where on the body, dropping that Agent slumping to the floor until, a moment later ...

Only Clay stands. Retracting the baton snapping back, he continues into the building.
 
65.


INT. HALPERN'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Halpern stands anxiously listening on his phone.	He nods.

HALPERN
Yes Sir. That’s what I thought Sir.

With a smarmy smile he turns and hands the phone to PETTIS.

HALPERN (CONT'D)
It’s for you.

Pettis eyes him.	Takes the phone.

PETTIS
This is Pettis?


INT. EVERMORE ENTERPRISES - NIGHT

Derek sits at his desk in an empty office, phone to his ear.

DEREK EVERMORE
Uh, hi. So Bob Halpern tells me you want to evacuate the building, send everyone home?

INTERCUT:

PETTIS
Yeah, that’s correct.

DEREK EVERMORE
Well - that’s a money-making
enterprise - in fact, the money-
making enterprise in the Evermore
constellation of industries.	Keeps
the lights on so to speak - and, if
possible, I’d rather not turn those
lights off.

PETTIS
Excuse me - did this character not already burn one of your centers to the ground today?

DEREK EVERMORE
Yeah, sure - but that was a
regional center - in Tennessee -
buncha fucking hicks - and they
didn’t have you.	Couldn’t you, you
know, like - just surround the
place and fuck up anybody who shows
up - or whatever it is you do?
 
66.


A TELE-ASSOCIATE sticks his head into the office.

ASSOCIATE
Uh - Mr. Halpern Sir?

They both look. He nods and through the office window, they see CLAY standing down at the entrance of the long room.

PETTIS
(hanging up)
I’ll call you back.


INT. CALL CENTER CORPORATE FLOOR - DAY

At the head of the room, CLAY glances at, studies for a moment, the Erase-Board of figures and cities. Takes up the MICROPHONE Halpern was using. Taps it.

CLAY
Testing?	Testing ... ?
(clears throat)
(addressing room) One-time chance. Whoever doesn’t want to die this evening, can - in an orderly fashion - leave now.

VOICE
Oh no!	Hell no!

At the far end of the office, HALPERN has emerged with Pettis to join his own Special Operatives gathered there.

HALPERN
Anyone who moves is fired instantly! No bonus! No vesting! No two weeks! No nothing! Zero!

All of the Associates freeze instantly - hovering in place at their stations.


At Halpern’s end, PETTIS and his OPERATIVES snap out and up their guns.

HALPERN (CONT'D)
(hisses at Pettis)

Are you fucking nuts?? Every one of these pricks between us and him brings in between 75 and 200 million a year from our regional centers. You will not shoot thru them!

Pettis hesitates an angry moment.	Then lowers his gun.
 
67.


PETTIS
(calls out)

Hey! Clay! All these people? Let’s not get them involved. Why don’t we, you know, ‘take it outside’ - as they say? And not involve these innocent bystanders?

Down the long room full of people, Clay cocks his head.

CLAY
What - these assholes?	They’re not
innocent.

PETTIS
Okay, maybe not.	But they’re not
as guilty as some others either.
And they’re between you and us -
and for either one of us to close
the distance - some of them will
get hurt - no way around it.

CLAY
No shit. Starting with this prick right here ...

He COLD-COCKS the nearest tele-associate, dropping him and then immediately starts down the line, punching and knocking unconscious man after man as ...

HALPERN
Wait wait wait! No no no!

PETTIS
Screw this ...

Pettis and his men raise their guns and OPEN FIRE - a ripping dragon’s breath of automatic-weapons fire that churns the room of desperately diving Tele- Associates - their computers and phones - into a maelstrom of flying debris.

A moment later, they stop - hearts pounding, as the dust of flat-screens and atomized phones settles. And they realize...

PETTIS (CONT'D)
Shit!	He’s gone!	Go!


INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Tactically, Pettis and his men move out of the room and into the hallway. The corridor is silent. Pettis signals and they split up in the hall like jets separating at an airshow.
 
68.


EXT. DATA GROUP CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

POLICE OFFICERS are massed, guns drawn, at the entrance, around the slumped bodies of the FEDERAL AGENTS when Verona and Wylie arrive, their own guns coming out.

VERONA
What’s the situation??

POLICE OFFICER
Bogie in the building. 9 down.
We’re waiting on SWAT.
(then)
Obviously.

Verona looks to the bodies of the Federal Agents lying at their feet - then to the POLICE PARAMEDIC there.

VERONA
Dead?

POLICE PARAMEDIC
(shakes head)
Paralytic shock; they’ll come out
of it.	This’ll sound crazy - but
it literally looks like bee-venom?

Verona looks back, processing.	Then nods.

VERONA
No.	Not so crazy.

And, gun leading, she ...

WYLIE
Verona!	No!

... moves into the building. Wylie hovers. Undecided.

WYLIE (CONT'D)
(then)
Fuck!

He moves in after her.


INT. CORRIDOR - DATA GROUP CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

PETTIS moves, gun-sights of his MP-5 leading. He pauses just behind the corner to the adjoining corridor - muzzle of his gun just jutting around it before ...

SOMETHING - brushes the muzzle of his gun. He frowns. Then...
 
69.


Steps around the corner.	To find CLAY standing there.

CLAY
Hey.

Pettis opens fire. But Clay just jerks his arm down and the explosion of gunfire just rakes across the floor at his feet.

Pettis looks up - startled - realizing that Clay holds one end of the MONOFILAMENT FISHING LINE Clay bought at the truck stop. The other end has been looped and drawn around the muzzle of his gun.

Enraged, he OPENS FIRE again - but Clay just jerks the gun sideways, gunfire chewing up the hall behind him.

CLAY (CONT'D)
You fish? Practically invisible but braided 550 pound test. Could haul in a Mako on the Gulf Coast with this.

Furious, Pettis tries to shoot again, but this time Clay just yanks the gun out of his hands with the monofilament and kicks him backward.


As Pettis climbs back to his feet, Clay discards the gun. Laces his fingers together, turns them outward, and cracks the 20 bones in them.

PETTIS
(grinning as he rises)
Oh.	It’s gonna be like that is it?

CLAY
It’s gonna be like that.	Do you
realize who it is you work for?

PETTIS
Sorry.	After I note the color of
the money, my inquiries stop.

CLAY
No moral component whatsoever?
You’d work for Hitler?

PETTIS
Well, I didn’t say that exactly.
Why? Who do you work for, Superman?

CLAY
Everyone.
(a shrug)
Just like Superman.
 
70.


He kicks Pettis stumbling backwards. But Pettis only sneers.

PETTIS
So you’re everybody’s bitch.
Congratulations.

From behind his back, he pulls a LONG GLEAMING KNIFE.

PETTIS (CONT'D)
Now you’re gonna be mine.

He charges, slashing like a shark into Clay who only just manages - several times - to barely sidestep.

They both stop. Clay looks down - several bloody slashes on his chest and thighs. Pettis smiles.

PETTIS (CONT'D)
This knife will cut through your braided 550 pound test like butter. Or, better yet, 30 gauge steel cable. Think of what it’s gonna do to you?

CLAY
Me?

He attacks - a flurry and a fury of brutal kicks and blows that drive Pettis back until Clay can take control of the knife in the man’s hand and - twisting him and it around ...

He drives it to the hilt slamming down in the man’s back.

CLAY (CONT'D)
Think of what’s it’s going to do to you?


With a yank he pulls it out of the gurgling man’s rib-cage, letting him drop as ...

The REST OF PETTIS’ TEAM enters the hall and OPENS FIRE, lighting the corridor up as Clay ducks away.


INT. FOYER - DATA GROUP CORPERATE OFFICES - NIGHT

VERONA and WILEY edge up, gun-to-cheek, to the elevators.
Push the button.
 
71.


INT. CORRIDOR - 10TH FLOOR - NIGHT

When the remaining four operatives of Pettis’s team edge into the corridor Clay just ducked into - they see - at the end, his feet just disappearing upward in the OPEN ELEVATOR there.

SEC-OP1
Go!

Rushing forward, they go skidding into ...


INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

The elevator where, raising their muzzles upwards, they UNLEASH - full-auto - into the ceiling, ripping it into a sieve of holes ...



INT. FOYER - DATA GROUP CORPERATE OFFICES - NIGHT

At the sustained sound of GUNFIRE echoing down the elevator shaft - Verona and Wiley exchange a glance.

What the fuck??


INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

The mass of FIRE vomiting out of the muzzles of the Security Operatives guns into the ceiling ceases - as they now stand, watching the perforated ceiling of the elevator above - for any tell-tale sign of remaining life.

Until - a VOICE - comes drifting down to them thru the sieve of holes in the ceiling.

VOICE
You done?

Shocked - they exchange a glance - then quickly move to
RELOAD.


INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT

Flattened close onto the shaft wall, CLAY - lances of light from the bullet holes beaming upward through the ventilated ceiling of the elevator below his feet - shrugs.

CLAY
Yeah ...
 
72.


With PETTIS’ KNIFE he reaches sideways and slices the elevator cable running up the wall from the COUNTER-WEIGHTS that hold it and ...


Cutting right through it - the elevator goes PLUMMETING down away, 10 floors ...

CLAY (CONT'D)
... you’re done.


INT. FOYER - DATA GROUP CORPERATE OFFICES - NIGHT

Verona and Wiley are BLOWN BACK as the elevator strikes the bottom of the shaft, exploding literally like a bomb.

Recovering their feet, they look - astonished - thru the torn steel of the doors into what’s left of the elevator.

And what’s left of Pettis’s team.


INT. BATHROOM - SALES FLOOR - DATA GROUP CORPORATE - NIGHT

HALPREN ducks down, going ...

HALPERN
No no no no!

... squirming behind a toilet as CLAY comes marching in and drags him up by the collar of his $2000 suit.

HALPERN (CONT'D)
No! Please! Don’t kill me! I’m innocent! I’m just a white-collar criminal! I’ve never physically hurt anyone in my life!

CLAY
(pulling him up)

And you want a cookie for that? Because you’ve never had the stones to look the man whose money you’re stealing in the eye?

He slams the man’s head against the wall.

HALPERN
Ow! Oh my god!	The violence! The
aggression! What are you doing!?

CLAY
Whatever I want. Do you have ...
 
73.


He slams his head into the wall again.

CLAY (CONT'D)
... a problem with that??

HALPERN
(a sniveling wreck now)

... no ... no ... hit my head into the wall again - I don’t care ...

CLAY
Great.	We’re on the same page.

He slams the man’s head into the wall again - denting the tile in. Pulls him up to face him.

CLAY (CONT'D)
Now. You are making a lot of money here. And you are going to tell me where it’s all going?

HALPERN
But I don’t...

Clay slams his head into the wall again.

CLAY
What is ‘who’ - doing with all this money? Which runs into the billions - that you’ve stolen from hard-working Americans who no longer have the means to protect themselves from parasites like you?

He slams the man’s head into the wall again for emphasis.

Then, holding the dazed man with one hand, he opens the cabinet under the sink and digging through the cleaning supplies, pulls out a bottle.

CLAY (CONT'D)
You know - one of the worst
parasites to attack a bee-hive is
the Varroa Mite.	You know how we
combat this threat to hive
equilibrium?

Biting the cap off the bottle he spits it out and begins splashing it into Halpern’s face.

CLAY (CONT'D)
Formic acid. Don’t worry, it may blind you - but it won’t kill you.
 
74.


HALPERN
No! Please!

CLAY
Tell me - where is all the money
Data Group is making going!

HALPERN
I can’t!	They’ll kill me!

CLAY
Yeah, but guess what - I’ll torture you. And then kill you. So there’s that.


He splashes more of the cleaning product into the man’s face.

HALPERN
Okay!	Okay!	I’ll tell you!

CLAY
No. You’ve stolen 100’s of millions from the people who built this country. You’re gonna show me.


INT. HALPERN’S OFFICE - NIGHT

Clay shoves Halpern in ahead of him to his desk where, shakily, Halpern, blinking, desperate, keys his COMPUTER to life. Types briefly, a SCREEN scrolling down.

VOICE
Clay!

Clay looks to see VERONA standing at the far end of the outer office. GUN leveled at him.

VERONA
Let him go Clay.

Clay looks back at her.

CLAY
Why?	This man is directly
responsible for your mother’s
death.

VERONA
(hesitates/then)
I know.	I - know but ...
(shakes head)
We have laws for these things.
 
75.


CLAY
No, Ms. Lincoln. You have laws for these things until the laws fail to fix the problem.


He nods.

CLAY (CONT'D)
Then you have me.

He ...

VERONA
No!

Smashes Halpern’s head into his keyboard, keys exploding, and
as Verona OPENS FIRE, he ducks out the side door ...


INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Directly into the corridor where ...

WILEY
Freeze!

Is drawn down on him. But Clay is way too fast for him, stripping the gun away in an instant and twisting Wiley’s arm behind him and slamming him against the wall, he racks the slide back on Wiley’s gun and jams Wiley’s pinky inside the receiver - like a cigar cutter - and hits the slide-release.

Wiley grimaces at the razor pressure on his finger inside his own gun.


CLAY
Do you want to lose it?

WILEY
No.

CLAY
Will you let me walk away?

Wiley hesitates.

WILEY
I don’t want to.

CLAY
I know.	Because you’re a good man.

Yanking Wiley’s gun away from his hand, he pistol-whips the Federal Agent into black unconscious.
 
76.


An instant later, VERONA bursts thru the door. Clearing the corridor in her gun-sights, she bends to feel Wiley’s pulse.

WILEY
(squinting up)
... are you ... an angel?

VERONA
No.	Sorry.
(half a smile)
Just FBI.

WILEY
... ah ... shit ...


INT. HALPERN'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Verona re-enters. POLICE OFFICERS are moving in, clearing the outer office. She pauses for an instant on Halpern’s crooked and unconscious body there ...

Then the screen of his computer. Slowly, she holsters her weapon as she clocks what she is seeing there.

VERONA
... holy ... shit ...

WESTWYLD PRE-LAP
... why I transferred to the
private sector ...


INT. UPSCALE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

WESTWYLD sits at a large round table at the center of what appears to be a very expensive restaurant. Derek Evermore and their wives along with several others are there.

WESTWYLD
In the public sector, you have
power but no money.	In the
private, the wealth you create
makes you powerful - so, presto-
chango - you have both.

A polite tinkling of laughter from the glitterati around the table. Pulling his phone, he glances at it. Raises a finger.

WESTWYLD (CONT'D)
One moment ...

Putting it to his ear, he listens - then nods.
 
77.


WESTWYLD (CONT'D)
... I see ... I see ...
(then/a grim sigh)
I see.

Hanging up, he gets up and walks away from the table without a word - leaving the others - especially Derek Evermore - sitting staring after.



EXT. OUTSIDE THE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

A few steps away from the valet, expensive European sports cars lining the curb.

WESTWYLD
Sally ...


INT. WEST WING CORRIDOR - WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT

A WOMAN, poised, sleek, well-dressed, is moving quickly with her own phone at her ear down a WEST WING CORRIDOR.

KELLY KRANE
Wallace ...

INTERCUT:

WESTWYLD
Have you been following the news?

KELLY KRANE
You mean this psychopath who’s been traveling across the country wreaking havoc? Who hasn’t?

WESTWYLD
Not a psychopath Kelly; a Bee
Keeper.

She slows briefly.	Then continues.

KELLY KRANE
Bullshit. Bee Keepers don’t cause chaos - they contain it.

WESTWYLD
Well apparently this one believes that by creating this chaos, he is containing it. You know - the whole break a few eggs to make an omelet thing?
 
78.


She walks, thinking intently.

KELLY KRANE
So what do you want from me?	Why
are you calling me?

WESTWYLD
Because. I need your boss to make a statement.

KELLY KRANE
About a Bee Keeper??

WESTWYLD
Not specifically - but about the fact that this is a national emergency and her heart and prayers go out to the victims and fervently hopes law enforcement will stop him swiftly, blah, blah, blah. A small tweet even would serve the purpose.

KELLY KRANE
Tweet? I’m sorry, who do you think my boss is? Yeah, ‘my boss don’t tweet’. And serve what purpose?

There is a beat.

WESTWYLD
To send the message to our
intelligence community that this
situation needs to be taken with
the utmost seriousness and ‘all’
that goes along with that.

KELLY KRANE
‘All’ like what Wallace?

Another beat.	Then.

WESTWYLD
The other Bee Keepers need to be
activated.

KELLY KRANE
(blinks/then)
Activate... the other 49 Bee
Keepers??

WESTWYLD
This one’s retired - so 50 - minus the one he killed - plus her replacement - so, yeah, 50.
(MORE)
 
79.

WESTWYLD (CONT'D)
Whatever - all of them - to the
east coast; pronto.	Because the
only thing that’s going to stop a
Bee Keeper...
(nods)

Is another Bee Keeper. Or 50 of them. The hive’s been kicked Kelly. It’s in chaos. It’s time for the invisible hand of the Bee Keepers to step in and fix the problem.

Kelly Krane walks a stunned moment.	Then ...

KELLY KRANE
You’re fucking crazy, you know that Wallace? You set loose 50 Bee Keepers and you’re looking at potentially 50 times the problem you have right now - plus Puerto Rico.

WESTWYLD
And if you don’t, in the next 24
hours you could end up with a
problem even bigger than all of
them combined!

KELLY KRANE
(silent an instant/then)
Why?	You know something I don’t
Wallace?

WESTWYLD
(sighs)
Just trust me Kelly.

KELLY KRANE
(walks/then)

No Wallace. I don’t. I’ll deliver the message about a statement - but I’m sure as hell not going to be any part of setting the Swarm loose in this country. Ciao Bella.

She hangs up, turning sharply thru Secret Service into...


INT. OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT

The Oval Office, where she addresses the PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.

KELLY KRANE
Madame President - a moment ...?
 
80.


INT. UPSCALE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

As Westwyld re-takes his seat, EVERMORE is looking at him.

DEREK EVERMORE
What??

It is a moment before, with disgust, Westwyld turns his eyes
on the younger man.	And hisses ...

WESTWYLD
You kicked the hive. And now we’re all going to reap the whirlwind that’s coming out of it.


INT. FBI JET - NIGHT

Flying low, VERONA watches the lights dotting the Virginia
countryside flowing past below.	Beside her, big Wylie ...

WYLIE
You really sure you wanna go
through with this?

She looks. He’s got an ice-pack against his head. He shrugs.

WYLIE (CONT'D)
These people flat-out robbed your mother. And a lot of other people who didn’t deserve it. We’ve been trying to build a case against them for 4 years.

(shrugs again)
And he comes along and starts to
solve it in 12 hours.

She looks back.	A breath.

VERONA
I like the ends. But I’m definitely not so sure about his means Wylie.
(shakes head)
Plus - where is this headed?	I
swore an oath.	Wherever it is,
headed, I can’t just stand by and
watch it happen.

WYLIE
Even if he’s right?

VERONA
(a hesitation/then/a nod)
Even if he’s right.
 
81.


INT. CORRIDORS - QUANTICO - NIGHT

Verona and Wylie, moving with purpose, make their way thru the hallways - every ceiling mounted screen broadcasting the PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS ...

PRESIDENT DANSWORTH
... appears to be what the FBI is
terming ‘Lone Wolf’ attacks ...

Turning to enter thru the open door of ...


INT. OFFICE OF THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR - NIGHT

... into the office of the Deputy Director of the FBI, who, remote in hand, is watching the impromptu Presidential address.

PRESIDENT DANSWORTH
... multiple locations across our
Southern states...

DEPUTY DIRECTOR PRIGG
(looking up)

Love this chick. Look at her. She’s already on it. And financing her own campaign? Again? Definitely voting for her again.

Flicking off the television, he spins in his chair to them.

DEPUTY DIRECTOR PRIGG (CONT'D)
Okay.	So whadda we got?

VERONA
Well Sir, we’re nearly certain he traveled to the Data Group Corporate headquarters in Atlanta, not to necessarily wreak the havoc he obviously did ...
(glance with Wiley/nods)
But to follow the money trail.

DEPUTY DIRECTOR PRIGG
Which ‘money-trail’ is that?
 
82.


VERONA
Sir, Data Group - as you know, through potentially fraudulent means targeting the most vulnerable sectors of our society, generates 100’s of millions of dollars annually. Fraud that’s extremely difficult to prosecute or trace...

WILEY
Which is why we’ve been trying to
build a tax case ...

VERONA
The question is - where is all of
that money going?	And the answer
appears to be now - Evermore
Enterprises, a massive multi-
conglomerate ...

DEPUTY DIRECTOR PRIGG
Licensed and operating out of
Virginia Beach.	Yes, I know it.
Everyone does.	You’re saying
Evermore owns Data Group?

VERONA
Through a very sophisticated and complex series of shell companies, yes. The buck, so to speak, ultimately stops at Evermore.

DEPUTY DIRECTOR PRIGG Then we need to scramble everything we’ve got in that direction. Evermore’s run by Derek Evermore and we all know who that is. This Adam Clay will probably go after him next - and we definitely can’t have that.

But Verona shakes her head.

VERONA
No.	We don’t think so Sir.

Prigg cocks his head.

DEPUTY DIRECTOR PRIGG
Why?

VERONA
Because Sir.	We don’t think Adam
Clay’s intent here is to punish.
(MORE)
 
83.

VERONA (CONT'D)
Vengeance isn’t in his psychological profile so far as we can tell.

DEPUTY DIRECTOR PRIGG
Then what is?

VERONA
(another glance to Wylie) Morality, Sir. He is - or believes he is - a moral force where and when the universe becomes immoral or unbalanced. He is the hand that corrects, not punishes.

(shakes head)
Therefore we believe he’s not
interested in symptoms ...

WYLIE
We think he’s interested in the
disease.

Prigg frowns back.

DEPUTY DIRECTOR PRIGG
If Data Group is the carcinoma -
and Derek Evermore sits atop
Evermore Enterprises - and that’s
the cancer ...
(he shrugs)
Isn’t he the disease?

Shaking her head, Verona pulls out the BOOK ON BEE-KEEPING; laying and tapping it on his desk.

VERONA
Sir, there’s something in the community of honey bees called the ‘Queen Slayer’. That’s a bee that rises up and kills the queen if she gives birth to defective young.

DEPUTY DIRECTOR PRIGG Okay. Bees? You’ve officially lost me.

VERONA
Mr. Deputy Director, Adam Clay keeps honey bees. He admires their purity. Their dedication to purpose. Their willingness to sacrifice themselves in the name of the greater good.
 
84.


She nods.

VERONA (CONT'D)
Therefore we now think that he
believes that Derek Evermore is not
the disease itself, but the
defective offspring of a Queen.
And because of that, instead of
going for the defective offspring,
he will instead strike at what he
believes to be the heart of the
problem - and become a Queen
Slayer.

DEPUTY DIRECTOR PRIGG
(stares back)

Do you mean to say - that Adam Clay might try next to kill Derek Evermore’s mother?

VERONA
President Danworth.	Yes, Sir.


INT. CORRIDORS - QUANTICO - NIGHT

Verona and Wylie hot on his heels, PRIGG is veritably charging down the hall.

VERONA
Sir, we think Clay now believes
that the monies funneled through
Data Group is at the basis of how
President Danworth self-financed
her successful independent run at
the White House three years ago.

DEPUTY DIRECTOR PRIGG
So basically stealing from her
constituents in order to get them
to vote her into office?
(shakes head)
Knowing what you know about this
President, do you believe that?

VERONA
(hesitates)

Sir I voted for her too but ... I’m not sure what to believe anymore.

DEPUTY DIRECTOR PRIGG
Regardless ...
(Agent hurrying at them)
(MORE)
 
85.

DEPUTY DIRECTOR PRIGG (CONT'D)
Pike - we may have incoming
directed at the President in the
White House.	We need to let our
sister agencies know and deploy
every asset immediately.

AGENT PIKE
Yes Sir but ...

DEPUTY DIRECTOR PRIGG
But what?

AGENT PIKE
(shakes head)
But the President isn’t at the
White House Sir.	She’s boarding
Air Force 1 as we speak.

DEPUTY DIRECTOR PRIGG
(stopping)
Headed where?

AGENT PIKE
(a shrug)

To Virginia Beach. For a charity fundraising brunch at her son’s compound on Virginia Beach tomorrow morning.

Prigg, Verona and Wylie exchange a glance.

DEPUTY DIRECTOR PRIGG
Can we stop her?

AGENT PIKE
Uh. Sure. But ... luminaries and some of the richest people from all over the world are already on-site so ...

(a shrug)
How?


EXT. EVERMORE COMPOUND - NIGHT

A massive compound of houses collected into a walled compound that sits on a prime piece of Virginia Beach real estate.

Essentially, Mar-a-Lago North.

The exterior grounds are already crawling with SECRET SERVICE.
 
86.


INT. DEREK EVERMORE’S HOME OFFICE - EVERMORE COMPOUND - NIGHT

WESTWYLD watches out the window as the Secret Service teams work the grounds with dogs, searching and securing the property.

WESTWYLD
I don’t want them inside the house during the event.

DEREK EVERMORE
But Wally...

WESTWYLD
(turning on him)
First of all, don’t call me that.
Don’t you fucking call me that.
You haven’t earned that right and
you never will.	Second, these
people ...
(the Secret Service)

They’re the B or C Team - at best. And if they’re between you and what might be coming down the pike at you - or more importantly - us? You’re going to die and so are they.

(nods)
And so am I.

He turns to EDELWEIS - a scarred and VERY TOUGH looking man in his early 40’s - who looks like he’s seen heavy combat in every corner of the earth. He’s the COMPOUND SECURITY HEAD.

WESTWYLD (CONT'D)
That cunt of a Chief-of-Staff won’t activate the A-Team - the Bee Keepers - so I want you to reach out - DM every stone cold mercenary killer you’ve ever met in a fox-hole who’ll murder for money, clear them through Secret Service - and get them here.


EXT. REAR SECURITY CHECK-POINT - EVERMORE COMPOUND - MORNING

The HEAD of the Secret Service Outer Security Detail stands in front of the barrier at the back gate of the Evermore compound - surveying the area with a keen eye.

BARRETT
What’s that?
 
87.


He is speaking to his Second in Charge, and indicating a MANHOLE COVER in the center of the road some 20 yards from the barrier check-point.

SECRET SERVICE SECOND Storm drain Sir. We checked. It starts there - it doesn’t run under or go into the compound. It only runs the other direction - out to the sea.

Barrett nods. Squints. Raises the binoculars that hang round his neck.

BARRETT
(handing field glasses)
What about that?

His second peers thru the glasses at the 71 MACH 1 MUSTANG parked facing them at the curve in the road some quarter mile distant.

SECOND
Car Sir. We’ve looked already. Some idiot left the engine running, but it’s definitely unoccupied.

Barrett frowns, considering.

BARRETT
Getaway vehicle?

SECRET SERVICE SECOND
Possible, Sir.	Do you want us to
disable and remove it?

BARRETT
(considers/then)

No. If it is, better not to alert the John Doe that we know what he’s up to - in case he’s got a Plan B. Put snipers on it. Shit hits the fan and anyone goes near it, light up the engine block and we’ll take him.


SECRET SERVICE SECOND
Copy that.
(radio)
East-end, west-end snipers, come
back ...

A CAR PULLS UP to the crash-barrier - Barret raising his hand. VERONA and WYLIE step out.
 
88.


BARRETT
Sorry, this is a private gathering. I’m going to have to ask you to leave.


Verona and Wylie flash their badges.

WYLIE
FBI.	We’re hip.

BARRETT
I don’t think so. You’re either gonna have to do a lot better than that or you can turn your car around right now - because we’re about to have a very long line of traffic here.

With a sigh, they both pull the lanyards from around their necks and hand him their badges - which he scrutinizes.

BARRETT (CONT'D)
I’ll have to call this in.

VERONA
Please do. In the meantime, we’re leading the Federal task-force on this. Can you tell us what security measures you have in place here?

BARRETT
(eyes them a second/then) Yeah. Standard for Presidential protection. Which is about as high as it gets on this planet.

VERONA
Like what?	Dogs?	Bomb squad?

BARRETT
Absolutely. Every vehicle will be thoroughly vetted and searched. All cavities, under-carriage with eyes-on, not just mirrors - and sniffer dogs, of course.

(shakes head)
No one’s coming in here concealed in a vehicle, that much I can tell you. It’ll be virtually impossible.

Verona and Wylie exchange a glance.	A breath, a nod.
 
89.


VERONA
Okay.	Make your call.	We’d like
to go in.


INT. DEREK EVERMORE’S HOME OFFICE - EVERMORE COMPOUND - DAY

Derek is doing LINES OF COCAINE at a small coffee table when the DOOR is opened and HIS MOTHER, PRESIDENT DANWORTH enters.

Quickly, he wipes it all away onto the floor, jumping up. DEREK EVERMORE
Mom!

Rubbing anxiously at his nose and upper lip, he rises and goes quickly to and embraces her.

DEREK EVERMORE (CONT'D)
I didn’t expect you so soon.	You
look wonderful!

PRESIDENT DANSWORTH
(dismissively disengaging) I’m exactly on the time I said I’d be. And why’re you talking so fast?

DEREK EVERMORE
What?	Me?	Am I?

She eyes the lightly white-dusted coffee table. Turns her eyes back to him.

PRESIDENT DANSWORTH
Stop chewing your lips.

DEREK EVERMORE
Oh ...

He covers his mouth with a hand.

DEREK EVERMORE (CONT'D)
Sorry.

PRESIDENT DANSWORTH
(a sigh)
Derek ...

DEREK EVERMORE
Yes Mother ... ?

PRESIDENT DANSWORTH
Come with me.
 
90.


She heads for the WINDOW and he dutifully follows. Down below on the lawn, tuxedoed BUTLERS are scurrying everywhere, setting up.


PRESIDENT DANSWORTH (CONT'D) You’re aware that this is a charity function for animal rights, right?

DEREK EVERMORE
Uh.	Yes?

PRESIDENT DANSWORTH And that wealthy and powerful animal lovers from all over the world will be here to attend and contribute to this worthy charity?

DEREK EVERMORE
Uh.	Yes?

PRESIDENT DANSWORTH
Then why - tell me - why - in fuck - did you choose to roast a whole cow for the event??

It’s true - there’s a WHOLE COW turning on a spit over a fire-pit behind a white table where several men in chef’s hats and white gloves are holding knives with cutting boards.

DEREK EVERMORE
Well. At least it’s not a live cow
Mom.

PRESIDENT DANSWORTH You’re a fucking idiot. You know, sometimes I wish you father were still alive. So I could slap him.

DEREK EVERMORE
Mom. Even animal lovers eat meat. Meat’s making a big comeback, you know. Hunting too. It’s almost impossible to build lean muscle without...

PRESIDENT DANSWORTH
Oh my god.	You’re a good looking
kid, you really are, you know that?

DEREK EVERMORE
(peers at her)
What’s that mean?
 
91.


PRESIDENT DANSWORTH
(dryly)

It means that God doesn’t give with both hands.

Turning, she walks out.


EXT. GROUNDS - EVERMORE COMPOUND - DAY

SEVERAL BLACK VANS pull up, expelling some VERY ROUGH looking customers - clearly ex Special Forces mercenaries from all over the world. Every one of them looks like he - or she - could win a bar-fight. With the whole bar.

The first one, who we’ve already met - EDLEWEISS - gives the surprised SECRET SERVICE AGENTS working the grounds there a look as he heads past towards the house.

EDELWEISS
Got something to say, Champs?

The Secret Service Agents - at a loss - don’t.

MEANWHILE, a dozen yards away, by the white-clothed tables, VERONA and WYLIE exchange a glance.

VERONA
Interesting.

WYLIE
Indeed.

SERVER BEHIND TABLE
Would the lady like some cow?

With a smile, he indicates the WHOLE COW turning crackling on a spit behind him. It looks kind of horrific.

VERONA
Uh.	No thank you.

WYLIE
(grabbing a plate)
Hey I’ll have some.


EXT. BACK GATE - EVERMORE COMPOUND - DAY

SPECIAL AGENT BARRETT stands overseeing the inspection of each of the NOW LONG LINE of vehicles waiting to get into the compound by a small army of Secret Service Security Agents.
 
92.


They carefully search the trunks, the interior of the car, while one agent, lying on a ‘creeper’ rolls under the under-carriage of each car, carefully inspecting with a mag-lite.

While a PORTABLE X-RAY is rolled along the sides of each vehicle.


Even the engine-compartment is checked.

Cleared, Barrett raises the barrier arm and waves the just-checked vehicle thru.

Raising his hand, he stops the next one, a STAKE-BED TRUCK.

DRIVER
Delivering.	Ice-sculptures.

BARRETT
Identification please.

The driver hands it over and as Barrett’s men go through the search procedures, he matches the picture against the man’s face, then steps into the guard house there, scans the ID and matches it manually against the written list of cleared vehicles. Walking behind, he checks the license plate.

Looks to his Search Team Lead, who emerges from searching beneath the truck.

SEARCH TEAM LEAD
All clear.

BARRETT
(driver)

All right, proceed 20 yards up to the fork and follow the sign to the loading dock.

DRIVER
(taking back ID)
Thanks.

BARRETT
(raising barrier)
Move it along.	Got a lot of
vehicles here today.

With a nod, the driver puts it in gear and drives through the check-point and up the short road to the fork in the road, where he pulls to a halt. Frowns.

Because the SIGNS there - one pointing one direction, the other in the opposite - are missing. Broken raggedly off.
 
93.


Almost like ... someone shot them off?

With a sigh, he glances in his side-rear-view mirror and putting it into reverse, backs up down the road - back to the barrier at the gate.


With annoyance, BARRETT comes from the car currently being searched and around the barrier to truck window.

BARRETT (CONT'D)
Yes? What are you doing?	We have
like 20 vehicles waiting here.

DRIVER
Yeah, sorry.	But the signs are
broken off?

Barrett squints at him.

WHILE: 20 yards back from the gate, the COVER moves sideways off the MANHOLE and CLAY crawls up under the vehicle waiting idling on top of it, and begins crawling up under the line of bumper-to-bumper cars waiting to get in.

WHILE AT THE BARRIER: Barrett’s annoyance is undisguised. He points up the road.

BARRETT
Look - just go to the fork and go
right - not left - that’s the house
- but right - that’s loading, okay?

DRIVER
Yeah, okay.

BARRETT
Chop chop. I got people waiting.

DRIVER
I’m going, I’m going.

And putting it in gear, he heads back up the hill.


EXT. LOADING - EVERMORE COMPOUND - DAY

The truck pulls up at loading. It’s a madhouse here. A man with a checkboard approaches as the driver debarks.

MAN WITH CHECKBOARD
Ice sculptures?

DRIVER
Yeah.
 
94.


The Man With the Checkboard peers into the stake-bed.

MAN WITH CHECKBOARD
Donald Trump?

DRIVER
It’s all the living presidents.
Whaddaya want from me.

MAN WITH CHECKBOARD
But why’s he so much bigger than
everyone else?

DRIVER
Look, I don’t make the decisions, I just drive them - capiche.

MAN WITH CHECKBOARD Yeah, sure, whatever. Make yourself comfortable. We’ll take it from here.

NEITHER OF THEM seeing CLAY as, having rolled out from the undercarriage of the Stake-Bed, strolls away and up to the house.



INT. HOUSE - EVERMORE COMPOUND - DAY

The FUNDRAISER is in full-swing when CLAY enters. Plainly enormously wealthy people, laughing, chatting and drinking as they are patrolled by EDELWEISS’S alert and eagle-eyed SECURITY MERCENARIES.

VOICE
Champagne Sir?

He looks.	A tuxedoed waiter with a tray.

CLAY
Milk if you have it.

The Waiter gives him a ‘does not compute’ look.

CLAY (CONT'D)
Never mind.

He continues on.	Taking in every detail of the layout.

There’s THE PRESIDENT, out on the lawn, chatting liberally with the guests.
 
95.


There’s WESTWYLD, standing talking to a group of wealthy attendees - but clearly acutely alert to everything that’s going on in the rest of the house.

There’s Derek Evermore - chatting up some young attractive female he seems to have cornered. Playfully toying with the strap of her dress.


And there’s VERONA LINCOLN and WYLIE. Wylie holds a plate piled with RED MEAT. But either way, both of them are staring right back at Clay.

They start for him, but turning, Clay pushes away, disappearing into the packed crowd inside the house, Verona’s RADIO snapping to her mouth as her hand goes to her gun inside her jacket.

VERONA
Bogie is on the premises!! East wing by pool! Cargo pants and denim shirt! He appears unarmed!!


EXT. BACK GATE - EVERMORE COMPOUND - DAY

BARRETT touches his ear, hearing - looks with surprise up to the house.



EXT. LAWN - EVERMORE HOUSE - NIGHT

On the lawn, EDELWEISS touches his own ear and, suddenly - to the shock of the wealthy guests around him, he draws his CUSTOMIZED GLOCK, hissing into his throat-mike ...

EDELWEISS
He’s in the house!	Go!	Go!


INT. HOUSE - EVERMORE COMPOUND - DAY

DEREK EVERMORE, still trying to toy with the young woman he has cornered, looks up as a HAND touches his shoulder.

His MOTHER.

PRESIDENT DANSWORTH
(young woman)
Pardon me.
(Derek)
Speak to you a moment in private?
 
96.


INT. HOUSE - EVERMORE COMPOUND - NIGHT

VERONA and WYLIE are shoving through the crowd, searching
every face trying to re-locate Clay ...

VERONA
There!

Just ahead through the crowd, CLAY hears her and - turning - ducks out through the nearest patio door.

VERONA (CONT'D)
(radio)
He’s outside!	He’s outside!

She and Wylie go pushing through the crowd, rushing after.


INT. HOUSE - EVERMORE COMPOUND - NIGHT

Edelweiss hisses into his own mike.

EDELWEISS
Outside!	Outside!


INT. DEREK EVERMORE'S HOME OFFICE - EVERMORE COMPOUND - DAY

When Derek enters after his mother, he is surprised to see KELLY KRANE, the President’s Chief-of-Staff, there.

DEREK EVERMORE
What’s this?

PRESIDENT DANSWORTH You remember Kelly right? Well this whole chain of events? It got her digging. And she has some interesting things to say now about where the money that financed my last campaign may really have come from ...


EXT. HOUSE - CLAMORE COMPOUND - DAY

THE WELL-HEELED GUESTS are just becoming conscious that something is going on as EDELWEISS and his men go pushing furiously through them - GUNS COMING OUT.

Abruptly, a HAND catches Edelweiss as he shoves his way thru the patrons of the fundraiser.

Sharply, he swings - but it’s VERONA.
 
97.


VERONA
(his gun out)

Are you crazy?? You start shooting here you’re gonna get people killed.

EDELWEISS
Maybe. But if he makes it a gunfight, you’d better believe I’m gonna be shooting back.

VERONA
Yeah, but can we please make sure
he’s gonna make it a gunfight
before the shooting starts?

He glares back - then, ripping his arm out of her grasp, he goes charging on through the crowd.


EXT. FRONT DRIVE - DAY

Clay emerges from the cloud of guests and heads walking
quickly towards the exits when ...

VOICE
Don’t move you fucking prick!

Clay slows.	Then stops.

VOICE (CONT'D)
That’s it.	Now down.

Clay turns his head. EDELWEISS - AND HIS MEN all coming running up, mini-machine-guns aimed at his head.

EDELWEISS
Fingers! Laced behind your head!
And down on your knees!	Now!

A breath. Then, slowly, Clay RAISES HIS SHIRT - and complies.

Aggressively, Edelweiss and his people move in, a bristling phalanx of bullet-filled guns converging on the back of Clay’s head.

EDELWEISS (CONT'D)
Bee Keeper my ass. You ain’t shit. Hope you’re ready for the Great Bee Hive in the Sky asshole.

He focuses the muzzle of his gun at the base of the Clay’s skull.
 
98.


VOICE
No!

Eyes rise.	VERONA - running up.

VERONA
(Clay’s naked/bare torso)
Can’t you see!?	He’s not even
armed!

EDELWEISS
Are you fucking kidding me??	As
long as a mother fucker like this
has arms he’s armed!

Subtly, his eyes rise - to a BALCONY back up at the house.
Where WOODWYLD stands.	Acutely, he is watching.

Equally subtly, he nods at Edelweiss - who faintly smiles. And gathering up the grip on his rifle, he sights back down on the back of Clay’s head.

VERONA
What the hell are you doing??

EDELWEISS
To ‘bee’ - or not to ‘bee’, Clay - that’s the question ...

His finger tightens on his trigger - but suddenly CLAY’S HANDS unlace from behind his head - and everyone abruptly realizes - that he HOLDS a BLACK TRIGGERING DEVICE.

MERCENARY
I’m might be a bomb!

Everyone freezes.	Clay shrugs.	Clicks the trigger.

CLAY
I think I’ll take - ‘to bee’.


EXT. ROAD - DAY

ECU - on the REAR TIRE of the ‘71 MACH 1 - and the half-submerged-in-sand CINDER BLOCK that it rests on - straining against its own drive-train as ...

Suddenly that cinderblock - and its sister beneath the other rear wheel - suddenly blow and WHEELS aruptly hitting earth, the car...


TAKES OFF.
 
99.


Blasting accelerating down the small back road ...

STEERING WHEEL locked in place, CINDER BLOCK on the
accelerator as ...


EXT. BACK ENTRY GATE - EVERMORE COMPOUND - DAY

BARRETT spins as he - and the other special agents suddenly
realize - that the MACH 1 is speeding directly at them ...

BARRETT
(radio)
Light it up! Light it up!


EXT. COMPOUND WALLS - DAY

SECRET SERVICE SNIPERS open fire ...


EXT. BACK ENTRANCE ROAD - DAY

Heavy caliber bullets smacking and smashing and pounding the
classic car as it accelerates - WINDSHIELD exploding ...

Towards the back gate ...


EXT. BACK GATE - EVERMORE COMPOUND - DAY

BARRETT diving out of the way as the Mach 1 comes smashing thru the barrier, going barreling past and up the service entry road ...



EXT. BACK LAWN - DAY

To the astonishment of Edelweiss and Verona and Wylie and the others, the Mach 1 comes careening up the service road and, as they go falling away, comes crashing into the side of the house there where, trunk exploding open ...

CLAY rises and calmly goes to it, reaches in - and pulls out THE BIGGEST MOTHER FUCKING GUN YOU’VE EVER SEEN ...

And turning to the nearest startled Mercenary ...

He BLOWS that man away. Turning, he cuts the next nearest Mercenary IN HALF, collapsing the window behind him.

And, as everyone goes diving, retreating away and for cover, he turns back to the trunk and - into every nylon loop on his shirt and the thighs, waist and hip of his cargo pants ...
 
100.


He shoves a GUN and ...

Almost literally COVERED IN PISTOLS, he turns back and
raising the rifle ...

BLOWS one of the retreating mercenaries out of his boots.

Stepping over that body - he enters the house.

VERONA and WYLIE, covering, guns drawn, behind an over-turned lawn-table, exchange a glance.

WYLIE
Well he’s certainly armed now.

VERONA
Shut up.	Let’s go.

And, rising, they move tactically towards the house.


INT. HOUSE - DAY

Clay moves swiftly thru the house, surgically identifying between the matrix of screaming, running guests while blowing ELDEWEISS’S MERCENARIES as they come at him thru the crowd.

He turns into a corridor - as whose end is massed A HALF DOZEN MERCENARIES - guns bristling and triggers squeezing.

Clay fires from his hip, emptying a magazine into the CEILING just above their heads, bringing down a RAIN of plaster.

For an instant, the Mercenaries’ views is obscured by a roiling cloud of white.

MERCENARY
Wait for it to clear! Wait for it clear!


Still ... very still ... they do. And in a moment - the white cloud of dust dissipates - revealing CLAY - standing directly in front of them.


He grabs the muzzle of the first man and as his automatic fire is dragged everywhere but at Clay, Clay, twists him around and BLOWS out the back of his head ...

A favor that he now dives into the tightly packed mass of men and repeats in knees, hands, hips, necks, faces and foreheads

-	dropping one pair of guns when they are empty a drawing the next with hardly a beat skipped in the continued allegro assault of gunfire until ...
 
101.


They are all dead and he is still stands. Stepping out of the hallways of dead, he continues on.


INT. DEREK EVERMORE'S HOME OFFICE - EVERMORE COMPOUND

DEREK, his MOTHER and KELLY listen to the screaming and carnage that is coming from the house.

PRESIDENT DANSWORTH
(Derek)
You did this, you realize that
right?	This is your doing.	You
kicked a hive that never should
have been kicked.

DEREK EVERMORE
Mom I was just trying to get you
into office!

PRESIDENT DANSWORTH
I was gonna win anyway and we were already rich! We have over 50 companies! This was greed! This was overkill! Not to mention excessive and nauseatingly immoral you creep!

DEREK EVERMORE
Yeah!	Great!	Mom!	We can get
into the who’s holier than thou
crap if live through this!
(points at door)

The question is - what’re you gonna do about this now!

She sits there - looking blandly back.

PRESIDENT DANSWORTH
Tell the truth.

He blinks back.

DEREK EVERMORE
Truth?	What truth?	What do you
mean, ‘tell the truth’?

PRESIDENT DANSWORTH I wouldn’t expect it to be a concept you’d understand. Tell him the truth about what you did Derek. In fact, I’m going to take the political hit and tell everybody. Because it’s the right thing to do.
 
102.


Derek stares at her. At Kelly Krane - who stands there, arms crossed.


DEREK EVERMORE
(quieter now/backing down)
... yeah... yeah... the truth...


INT. CORRIDOR - HOUSE - EVERMORE COMPOUND - DAY

Clay steps into a corridor and EDELWEISS kicks him back into the collapsing wall and is on him, pummeling his liver and kidneys until Clay manages to grab his ears and ...

Headbutts him stumbling back as Clay tackles him thru that wall and ...



INT. LIVING ROOM - HOUSE - CLYMORE COMPOUND - DAY

... into the living room, smashing down onto a very expensive mirrored table that explodes into reflective shards - one of which Clay snatches up and slams down towards Edelweiss’s throat ...

But Edelweiss catches it and they both hover there as Clay tries to lean the sharp shard of mirror into that man with everything he has until ...

In the shard’s reflection, he suddenly sees ...

A MERCENARY running at him with a MASSIVIE KNIFE.

Abruptly rolling off Edelweiss, he surprises the man by rolling behind him and slicing both his Achilles with the glass and, catching the man’s OWN KNIFE as it falls ...

He jams it’s point to Edelweiss’s ear.	Edelweiss looks back.

EDELWEISS
You don’t have to do it clay.

Clay looks back.

CLAY
If I don’t, you’ll just come after me till you kill me.
(he nods)
If I’m wrong - tell me.

Edelweiss’s jaw works - but he doesn’t deny it. Clay pushes the knife thru his ear into his brain.
 
103.


INT. STAIRWAY TO DEREK EVERMORE’S OFFICE - NIGHT

When Clay steps into the narrow staircase leading up to Derek Evermore’s office, WESTWYLD is standing at the top with an AK-47 which he lets go - tearing up the hall.

Clay falls back to cover. Touches the BULLET-HOLE in his shoulder. Winces.

WESTWYLD
(calling out)
Why couldn’t you just let it go!?
Go back to your little bee-hives
making honey for your neighbors!

CLAY
I might have. Except my neighbor’s dead.


Westwyld’s features tighten.	He understands what Clay means.

WESTWYLD
Clay goddamit! What the hell do you care how President’s get elected??

CLAY
I don’t.

WESTWYLD
(frowns/then)
Then what do you care about.

CLAY
Right ...

He steps back into the staircase.

CLAY (CONT'D)
And wrong.

WestWyld’s UNLOADS the rest of his clip wildly into the stair-well - but Clay - un-hit - starts up.

CLAY (CONT'D)
There is an objective good in the
universe.

WestWyld tries to jam another magazine into his gun, but Clay shoots it out of his hand as he comes up the steps.

CLAY (CONT'D)
I believe that natural good is
reflected in the natural order.
 
104.


WestWyld tries to jam another magazine into his gun, but again Clay shoots that one out of his hand too as he comes up the steps.

CLAY (CONT'D)
And when that order is disturbed -
I correct it.

Desperately, WestWyld tries to jam his last clip into his gun, but Clay shoots it out of his hand too as he stops on the steps in front of the man.

He raises his pistol and places it to the trembling man’s forehead.


CLAY (CONT'D)
I don’t know why I do what I do.
It’s just the way I’m built.

BLAM! he blows Westwyld’s brains all over the outside of Derek Evermore’s office door.


INT. DEREK EVERMORE'S HOME OFFICE - EVERMORE COMPOUND - DAY

The shot reverberates all-too loudly here in Derek’s office.
From his desk, he looks to his mother.

DEREK EVERMORE
(his mother)

You think what? You’ll tell him the truth and he’ll kill me instead of you?


PRESIDENT DANSWORTH It’s worth a shot. But that’s not why I’ll tell him the truth.

DEREK EVERMORE
Well then why!?

PRESIDENT DANSWORTH
Because it’s the goddam truth!

DEREK EVERMORE
Well guess what Mom. At the end of the day, truth isn’t what comes out of your mouth ...

From the drawer of his desk, he takes out a NICKEL-PLATED REVOLVER and SHOOTS Kelly Krane point-blank in the chest.

DEREK EVERMORE (CONT'D)
It’s what comes out of your gun.
 
105.


As she topples he turns and points the gun at his mother.

DEREK EVERMORE (CONT'D)
Surprise.

PRESIDENT DANSWORTH
(with venom)
Not even remotely.

Instantly, the reinforced steel door of his office BLOWS inwards off its hinges and, stepping in, CLAY levels his gun on The President and her Son.

VOICE
Clay!	No!

He looks to see VERONA on the veranda, in a shooting stance, gun leveled at him.

VERONA
Don’t.

CLAY
What do you work for Ms. Lincoln?
Law?	Or Justice?

He nods.

CLAY (CONT'D)
Because I know which one I work
for.

As Derrek Evermore suddenly swings his gun around, Clay shoots him dead and Verona shoots him.

As both men drop, Verona rushes to administer first aid to the President’s son while WILEY comes bursting in through the door and comes sliding in to help too.

But after a few moments, it’s clear - it’s no good. Derek Evermore is dead.

Verona looks to the President who is fighting back tears.

PRESIDENT DANSWORTH
He was a sleaze but ....
(shakes head)
I’m still a mother ...

Reaching, Verona squeezes her hand.	Looks to Wiley.

VERONA
I guess I got it wrong - it’s bees that become Queen Slayers ...
(MORE)
 
106.

VERONA (CONT'D)
(shakes head)
Not the Bee Keeper.

They both look to CLAY’S BODY in the doorway.

Only - both of them rise to their feet because ...

It’s gone.	The stairway corridor is massed with LAW
ENFORCEMENT fighting to get in ...

He couldn’t have gotten out that way.

Verona and Wiley exchange a glance. She rushes out onto the open veranda overlooking the ocean.


EXT. VERANDA

Beneath the sea-oat dotted dunes, the blue-grey Atlantic rolls away.


She looks every direction but - nothing. Just the vast anonymity of the ocean.

And a SINGLE LIMPING SET OF FOOT PRINTS that lead down into it ...


But do not return.

She notices a SINGLE HONEY BEE - sitting on the veranda rail, fluttering its wings and cleaning it tongue with its front legs.


She gazes at it in all its perfection, it’s natural beauty - for an extended moment.

It suddenly takes flight and flutters off - disappearing away into the endless void of sand, oats and sea.

She smiles.

VEREONA
See you Adam Clay.	See you very
soon.

She feels something in her pocket.	Pulls out a BOOK.

‘BEE-KEEPING FOR BEE-KEEPERS’. She smiles again. Looks out over the ocean.

VERONA
I’m quite sure.
