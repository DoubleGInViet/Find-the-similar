BURNING. Massive flames. A dark shape emerges- The BAT SYMBOL. Growing. Filling the screen with BLACKNESS.

CUT TO:

DAYLIGHT.	Moving over the towers of downtown Gotham...
Closing in on an office building... On a large window...

Which SHATTERS to reveal-

INT. OFFICE, HIGH RISE -- DAY

A man in a CLOWN MASK holding a SMOKING SILENCED PISTOL ejects a shell casing. This is DOPEY. He turns to a second man, HAPPY, also in clown mask, who steps forward with a CABLE LAUNCHER, aims at a lower roof across the street and FIRES a cable across. Dopey secures the line to an I-beam line- CLAMP on- sends a KIT BAG out then steps OUT the window...

EXT. HIGH-RISE -- DAY

...into space.	The men SLIDE across the DIZZYING DROP...
landing on the lower roof across the street.

EXT. DOWNTOWN GOTHAM -- DAY

A MAN on the corner, back to us, holding a CLOWN MASK. An SUV pulls up. The man gets in, puts on his mask. Inside the car- two other men wearing CLOWN MASKS.

GRUMPY
Three of a kind.	Let's do this.

One of the Clowns looks up from loading his automatic weapon.

CHUCKLES
That's it?	Three guys?

GRUMPY
There's two on the roof. Every guy is an extra share. Five shares is plenty.

CHUCKLES
Six shares. Don't forget the guy who planned the job.

GRUMPY
Yeah? He thinks he can sit it out and still take a slice then I get why they call him the Joker.

Grumpy cocks his weapon. Bozo pulls the car over in front of the GOTHAM FIRST NATIONAL BANK.
 
2.


EXT. ROOFTOP, BANK -- CONTINUOUS

Dopey PRIES open an access panel-

HAPPY
Why do they call him the Joker?

DOPEY
I heard he wears make-up.

HAPPY
Make-up?

Dopey pulls out thick bundles of blue CAT 5 cables.

DOPEY
Yeah.	To scare people.	War paint.

EXT. BANK -- CONTINUOUS

Grumpy, Chuckles and Bozo get out of the car and march into the bank CARRYING ASSAULT RIFLES-

INT. BANK -- DAY

The Security Guard looks up- Grumpy FIRES into the ceiling.
Customers SCREAM.	Chuckles CRACKS the Security Guard.

As Grumpy and Bozo round up the hostages, one of the TELLERS presses a button mounted beneath her window- a SILENT ALARM.

EXT. ROOFTOP -- DAY

Dopey watches the alarm PING his handheld.

DOPEY
Here comes the silent alarm.
(touches a button)

And there it goes. That's funny. It didn't dial out to 911- it was trying to reach a private number.

Behind him, Happy RAISES his silenced HANDGUN.

HAPPY
Is it a problem?

DOPEY
No, no.	I'm done here.

Happy SHOOTS.	Dopey SLUMPS.	Happy picks up his bag and
FORCES OPEN the roof access door...

INT. STAIRWELL, BANK -- DAY

...and speeds down the stairs, to the basement.	He SLAMS
open the door...
 
3.


INT. VAULT ROOM, BANK -- DAY

...and comes face to face with a huge VAULT.

INT. LOBBY, BANK -- DAY

Bozo and Grumpy move down the line of hostages- Bozo hands each Hostage OBJECTS from a bag. A GRENADE. Grumpy follows,

PULLING THE PINS.

GRUMPY
Obviously, we don't want you doing anything with your hands other than holding on for dear life.

BLAM. Chuckles is BLOWN OFF HIS FEET- Grumpy and Bozo DIVE for cover- the Bank Manager steps out of his office, SHOTGUN in hand. Hostages SCRAMBLE, CLINGING their grenades...

INT. VAULT ROOM, BANK -- DAY

Happy CLAMPS a DRILL to the vault- the bit SPINS- SLIDES into the metal door- a BOLT of ELECTRICITY RIPS THROUGH THE DRILL, THROWING HAPPY TO THE FLOOR-

INT. LOBBY, BANK -- DAY

Grumpy and Bozo cower as the Bank Manager FIRES again.

GRUMPY
He's got three left?

Bozo raises TWO fingers. Grumpy squeezes off a SHOT. The Bank Manager FIRES. FIRES again. Grumpy looks at Bozo, who nods. Grumpy JUMPS UP.

The Bank Manager FIRES- Grumpy GRUNTS as buckshot CLIPS his shoulder. FALLS. The Bank Manager moves in for the kill, FUMBLING for new shells. Bozo STANDS- SHOOTS him.

Bozo picks up the shotgun. Grumpy checks his wound- it's superficial. He struggles to his feet.

GRUMPY
Where'd you learn to count?!

Bozo's mask stares him down. Grumpy heads for the stairs in the back. Bozo starts loading fresh shells into the shotgun.

BANK MANAGER
You have any idea who you're stealing from? You and your friends are dead.

Bozo looks down at him.	Says nothing.
 
4.


INT. VAULT ROOM, BANK -- DAY

Happy at the vault door, barefoot, turning the tumblers with hands stuffed into his SNEAKERS. Grumpy walks in.

HAPPY
They wired this thing up with 5,000 volts. What kind of bank does that?

GRUMPY
A mob bank.	Guess the Joker's as
crazy as they say.

Happy shrugs.	Grips the WHEEL BOLT and SPINS it.

GRUMPY
Where's the alarm guy?

HAPPY
Boss told me when the guy was done I should take him out. One less share.

GRUMPY
Funny, he told me something

similar...

Happy FREEZES. The wheel SPINS to a STOP- the vault DOOR CLUNKS OPEN- Happy GRABS for his weapon- SPINS to see Grumpy SHOOT. Grumpy steps over Happy into the vault...

INT. VAULT, BANK -- DAY

...which is filled with an eight-foot MOUNTAIN OF CASH.

INT. LOBBY, BANK -- DAY

Grumpy walks into the lobby, straining under several DUFFELS filled with cash. He DUMPS them. Looks at Bozo. LAUGHS.

GRUMPY
C'mon, there's a lot to carry...

INT. LOBBY, BANK -- DAY

Bozo walks back into the lobby with two more DUFFELS. Sets them down on an ENORMOUS PILE. Grumpy looks at it.

GRUMPY
If this guy was so smart he would

have had us bring a bigger car.

Grumpy JABS his pistol in Bozo's back.	Takes his weapon.

GRUMPY
I'm betting the Joker told you to kill me soon as we loaded the cash.
 
5.


BOZO
(shakes head)

No.	I kill the bus driver.

GRUMPY
Bus driver?	What bus-

Bozo steps backwards. SMASH. Hostages SCREAM as the TAIL END OF A YELLOW SCHOOL BUS ROCKETS through the front of the bank, SLAMMING Grumpy into the teller's window.

Bozo picks up Grumpy's weapon. Another clown OPENS the rear door of the bus. Bozo SHOOTS him. Then loads the bags onto the bus. The wounded Bank Manager watches him. In the distance: SIRENS.

BANK MANAGER
Think you're smart, huh? Well, the guy who hired you's just do the same to you...

Bozo slowly shakes his head.

BANK MANAGER
Sure he will. Criminals in this town used to believe in things...

Bozo turns back to the Bank Manager.	Crouches over him.

BANK MANAGER
Honor.	Respect.	What do you

believe, huh?	What do you bel-

Joker slides a GRENADE into the man's mouth. A PURPLE THREAD is knotted around the pin.

THE JOKER
I believe that what doesn't kill

you...

Bozo PULLS off his MASK. The Bank Manager GASPS. In the reflections of the glass DEBRIS behind the Bank Manager we see GLIMPSES of a SCARRED MOUTH and CLOWN MAKEUP. THE JOKER.

THE JOKER
...simply makes you stranger.

The Bank Manager's eyes go wide.	The Joker rises, strolls
towards the bus, the purple thread attached to the grenade
pin UNRAVELLING FROM THE PURPLE LINING of his jacket as he
walks.	The Joker climbs into the bus, SHUTS the rear door,
TRAPPING THE PURPLE THREAD...

EXT. SCHOOL, GOTHAM -- DAY

Kids pour out, heading onto a long line of school buses.
 
6.


INT. BANK -- CONTINUOUS

As the bus pulls out, the purple thread PULLS THE PIN-hostages scream and scurry away from the Bank Manager, who shakes with fear as, with a FIZZ, the grenade does not explode, but SPEWS RED SMOKE.

EXT. BANK -- DAY

The School Bus pulls free of the Bank wall and pulls out onto the street, SLIDING INTO THE LINE OF IDENTICAL BUSES HEADING PAST THE BANK. The buses trundle past COP CARS racing up the street... and we-

CUT TO:

EXT. MOVING OVER GOTHAM -- NIGHT

From the top of a brick building a SHAFT OF LIGHT comes on.

EXT. VARIOUS LOCATIONS -- CONTINUOUS

A PATROLMAN looks up at the BAT-SIGNAL. Smiles. A DEALER standing beside a car spots the signal. Steps back.

DEALER
No, man.	I don't like it tonight.

BUYER
What're you, superstitious? You got more chance of winning the powerball than running into him...

INT. MAJOR CRIMES UNIT, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT

DETECTIVE RAMIREZ, female, rookie detective, 30's, makes coffee, watching a news show on the television.

ON SCREEN: The host, MIKE ENGEL, lays into the MAYOR.

ENGEL
Mr Mayor, you were elected on a campaign to clean up the city... when are you going to start?

MAYOR
Well, Mike-

ENGEL
Like this so-called Batman- a lot of people say he's doing some good that criminals are running scared...

but I say NO. What kind of hero needs to wear a mask? You don't let vigilantes run around breaking the law... where does it end?
(MORE)
 
7.
ENGEL (cont'd)
Yet, we hear rumors that instead of trying to arrest him the cops are using him to do their dirty work.

MAYOR
I'm told our men in the Major Crimes
Unit are close to an arrest.

RAMIREZ
Hey, Wuertz- the Mayor says you're closing in on the Batman.

WUERTZ looks up, listless.	Crumples up a paper.

WUERTZ
The investigation is ongoing.

He throws the paper at the trash. It rebounds off a board headed 'BATMAN: SUSPECTS.' Lined with pictures: Abraham Lincoln. Elvis. The Abominable Snowman.

EXT. ROOFTOP, MAJOR CRIMES UNIT -- NIGHT

Ramirez comes out onto the roof. LIEUTENANT GORDON sits by a SEARCHLIGHT. She hands Gordon a cup of coffee.

RAMIREZ
Ever intending to see your wife

again, Lieutenant?

GORDON
I thought you had to go look after your mother, detective.

RAMIREZ
They checked her back into hospital.

GORDON
I'm sorry.

RAMIREZ
(making light)

Least there she's got someone round the clock. Unlike your wife.
(looks at bat-signal)

He hasn't shown?

Gordon gets up.	Looks into the sky at the bat-signal.

GORDON
Often doesn't. But I like reminding everybody that he's out there.

RAMIREZ
Why wouldn't he come?

GORDON
Hopefully...	Because he's busy.
 
8.


EXT. PARKING GARAGE -- NIGHT

Two black SUV's pull onto the top floor. A large man emerges-the CHECHEN. A BODYGUARD points at the sky. The Chechen peers up at the BAT-SIGNAL. Shrugs.

CHECHEN
That's why we bring dogs.

BODYGUARD 2 opens the back door- three enormous ROTWEILERS emerge, GROWLING. The Chechen crouches, KISSING the dogs.

CHECHEN
My little princes...
(to bodyguards)
The Batman's invisible to you

fools... but my little princes... they can find human meat in complete darkness.

The Chechen moves to the second SUV, reaches in and DRAGS out a skinny, wild-eyed JUNKIE by his hair.

JUNKIE
(babbling)

No!	No get 'em off me!	Off me!

The Chechen drags the Junkie towards a battered white van.
The van's REAR DOORS OPEN... two armed THUGS emerge, carrying
BARRELS...	a third hovers in the dark interior.

CHECHEN
Look! Look what your drugs did to my customers!

VOICE (O.S.)
Buyer beware...

The figure emerges: SCARECROW.	Wearing his mask.

SCARECROW
I told your man my compound would take you places. I never said they'd be places you wanted to go.

CHECHEN
My business is repeat customers.

SCARECROW
If you don't like what I have to offer, buy from someone else. Assuming Batman left anyone else to buy from.

The Chechen frowns.	THE DOGS START BARKING.
 
9.


BODYGUARD
(nervous)

He's here.

A BURLY THUG at the periphery is suddenly SUCKED into the darkness. In his place a shadow straightens, revealing POINTED BAT-EARS against the glittering skyline.

CHECHEN
Come on, sonofbitch- my dogs are
hungry, pity there's only one of

you...

A BODYGUARD to the side DISAPPEARS with a scream, and a SECOND BAT-SHADOW appears.

The Chechen looks taken aback. Three more BAT-SHADOWS appear... even the dogs stop growling.

BOOM! A hole appears in the SUV next to the Chechen. The first bat-shadow steps into the light carrying a SHOTGUN.

CHAOS as men scatter and the rooftop erupts in GUNFIRE. The Chechen TURNS as he hears one of his men SCREAM.

CHECHEN (CONT’D)
Loose the dogs!

A Bodyguard releases the DOGS- they RACE, SALIVATING, into the darkness...

The Dogs RACE towards a Bat-Shadow- the first dog LEAPS, gets its JAWS around the Bat-Shadow's throat...

Scarecrow ducks behind the van- holes PUNCHED in the side by shotgun blasts right behind him. He starts to climb into the driver's seat-

The muzzle of a shotgun is pressed to the back of his head- a bat-shadow is behind him- he SPRAYS him with FEAR TOXIN- the bat-shadow collapses to the ground, SCREAMING. The Cechnyan, cowering from gunfire, looks down at him.

SCARECROW
Not the real thing.

CHECHEN
How you know?

SCARECROW
We're old friends.

A HUGE BLACK SHAPE SLAMS down onto a row of parked cars. The BATMOBILE.

SCARECROW
That's more like it.
 
10.


The Chechen's men BLAST away at the front of the car: the bullets SPARK off its monstrous surface harmlessly...

INT. BATMOBILE -- CONTINUOUS

The cockpit is EMPTY. One of the screens reads "LOITER". The shooting STOPS. The screen switches to "INTIMIDATE"

EXT. PARKING GARAGE -- CONTINUOUS

The men STARE at the Batmobile for a quiet moment... BOOM! The Batmobile CANNONS blast cars all around the men-

A bat-shadow lines up his shotgun on a running bodyguard-CLUNK- a BLACK GAUNTLET grasps the barrel and BENDS it upwards with a HOWL of tortured steel- the bat-shadow looks into the face of the Batman. The REAL BATMAN.

The Bat-shadow STUMBLES BACKWARDS in terror, leaving the bent shotgun in Batman's hand. Batman OPENS his hand, revealing a PNEUMATIC MANGLE hidden in his palm-

Batman bears down on the dogs mauling another bat-shadow-DRAWS his GRAPPLING GUN and SHOOTS his grapple into the fake Batman's leg and RIPS him from the dogs, one dog HANGING ON as Batman pulls the unconscious man away... the Chechen RUNS down the ramp towards the exit...

As Batman KICKS the dog off the fake Batman- the Chechen gets into his SUV- another dog LOCKS ITS JAWS around Batman's forearm, RIPPING, TEARING- Batman SWINGS THE DOG OVER HIS HEAD- SMASHES it against the ground- its jaws OPEN...

Batman rises, an engine RACES behind him- he can't turn in time- BLAM- he's SLAMMED sideways by the speeding van.

INT. VAN -- CONTINUOUS

Scarecrow, driving, NODS at him and hits the gas... Batman raises his hand, revealing his jointed mangle and pistons. The mangle STRAIGHTENS and ROTATES from his palm to the knife edge of his opened hand...

Batman CHOPS straight through the windshield- pulls his hand out and CHOPS again- the mangle gets STUCK- Scarecrow steers towards a column...

EXT. PARKING GARAGE -- CONTINUOUS

Batman can't free himself- he turns a dial on his forearm piston- EXPLOSIVE BOLTS blow, freeing his gauntlet from the

mangle- he ROLLS free of the van as it SCRAPES the column and barrels down the circular exit ramp.

Batman rises. A phony batman lying on the ground watches as Batman climbs up to the edge of the ten-story corkscrew ramp and stands there, waiting for something.
 
11.


After a moment he JUMPS... and falls... ten stories...

He's about to hit the exit ramp- the van appears- his cape POPS OPEN- he SLAMS into the roof, CRUSHING the cab.

EXT. ROOFTOP, PARKING GARAGE -- MOMENTS LATER

The Chechen's men are lined up against the wall, bound with zip-ties. So are the fake batmen. Batman DUMPS Scarecrow next to the three "Batmen", RIPS his mask off.

"BATMAN"
We're trying to help you!

BATMAN
I don't need help.

SCARECROW
Not my diagnosis.

Batman silences Scarecrow with his boot.	Turns to "Batman"

BATMAN
Don't let me find you out here again.

Batman moves towards the Batmobile.

"BATMAN"
You need us! There's only one of you-it's war out here!

Batman gets into the Batmobile.

"BATMAN"
What gives you the right?! What's the difference between you and me?!

As the Canopy hisses shut-

BATMAN
I'm not wearing hockey pads.

The "Batman" looks down at his makeshift costume as the Batmobile ROARS past.

EXT. BANK -- NIGHT

LIEUTENANT GORDON ducks the barrage of SHOUTED QUESTIONS from press and picks his way into the lobby of the bank.

INT. LOBBY, BANK -- NIGHT

FORENSIC SPECIALISTS work the room. Ramirez hands Gordon PRINTS- indicates the surveillance cameras.

RAMIREZ
He can't resist showing us his face.
 
12.


Gordon looks at the grainy blow-up of THE JOKER'S FACE:
sweating clown makeup plastered thick around the mouth.

GORDON
Put this out, by morning we can put a big top over central holding and sell tickets. What's he hiding under that makeup?

Gordon approaches a FORENSIC PHOTOGRAPHER shooting Grumpy's body. Gordon crouches to look at his clown mask. Batman steps from the shadows. Gordon nods at Ramirez.

RAMIREZ
Give us a minute, please, people!

The Forensic team and Ramirez leave. Gordon hands Batman the blow-up of the Joker.

BATMAN
Him again.	Who are the others?

GORDON
Another bunch of small timers.

Batman pulls a DEVICE from his belt- moves to the bundles of cash scattered near the clown's body. The device PINGS. Batman picks up a BUNDLE. Hands it to Gordon.

BATMAN
Some of the marked bills I gave you.

GORDON
My detectives have been making drug buys with them for weeks. This bank was another drop for the mob. That makes five banks- we've found the bulk of their dirty cash.

BATMAN
Time to move in.

Gordon waves the photo.

GORDON
What about this Joker guy?

BATMAN
One man or the entire mob? He can wait.

GORDON
We'll have to hit all banks simultaneously. SWAT teams, backup.

Gordon holds up the bundle of banknotes.
 
13.


GORDON
When the new DA gets wind of this, he'll want in.

BATMAN
Do you trust him?

GORDON
Be hard to keep him out.

Gordon bags the cash.

GORDON
I hear he's as stubborn as you. But Batman is already gone. INT. WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- MORNING

Alfred walks past soaring downtown views as he carries a breakfast tray through the vast, empty penthouse. He stops, looking at a still-made bed. Alfred sighs, turns.

EXT. RAIL YARDS -- MORNING

Alfred gets out of the Rolls carrying a thermos. He walks towards a RAILWAY BRIDGE, stops at a FREIGHT CONTAINER sitting, lopsided, on blocks. Alfred unlocks the RUSTY PADLOCK AND CHAIN. Steps inside.

INT. FREIGHT CONTAINER -- CONTINUOUS

Alfred FUMBLES in the dark- bangs his elbow- A HISS as the
FLOOR LOWERS... Alfred sinks down into...

INT. BAT-BUNKER -- CONTINUOUS

The container floor lowers on a giant PISTON. Alfred steps off into a large, LOW-CEILINGED CONCRETE CHAMBER. The Batmobile sits in the middle. Machines- 3d printers, power tools- dot the high-tech space. At one end, Wayne sits at a bank of monitors watching CCTV footage of the bank robbery.

ALFRED
Be nice when Wayne Manor's rebuilt and you can swap not sleeping in a penthouse for not sleeping in a mansion.

Alfred places a cup of coffee in front of Wayne, who is STITCHING up a cut on his arm.

ALFRED (CONT’D)
(takes needle)

When you stitch yourself up you make a bloody mess.
 
14.


WAYNE
But I learn from my mistakes.

ALFRED
You ought to be pretty knowledgeable by now, then.

WAYNE
My armor... I'm carrying too much

weight- I need to be faster.

ALFRED
I'm sure Mr.Fox can oblige.
(looks at wound)

Did you get mauled by a tiger?

WAYNE
A dog.
(off look)

A big dog. There were more copycats last night, Alfred. With guns.

ALFRED
Perhaps you could hire some of them and take weekends off.

WAYNE
This wasn't exactly what I had in mind when I said I wanted to inspire people.

ALFRED
I know.	But things are improving.
Look at the new District Attorney...

Wayne indicates a monitor: a handsome MAN in a suit.

WAYNE
I am. Closely. I need to know if he can be trusted.

Alfred looks at other images- the D.A. at a meeting.
Campaigning.	Helping someone out of a cab: RACHEL.

ALFRED
Are you interested in his character... or his social circle?

WAYNE
Who Rachel spends her time with is her business.

ALFRED
Well, I trust you're not following me on my day off.

WAYNE
If you ever took one, I might.
 
15.


Alfred bites the thread. Examines his stitches. Looks at the SCARS criss-crossing Wayne's shoulders.

ALFRED
Know your limits, Master Wayne.

WAYNE
Batman has no limits.

ALFRED
Well, you do, sir.

WAYNE
I can't afford to know them.

ALFRED
And what happens the day you find

out?

WAYNE
We all know how much you like to say 'I told you so'.

ALFRED
That day, Master Wayne, even I won't want to. Probably.

INT. COURTROOM, SUPERIOR COURT -- DAY

HARVEY DENT bursts into the courtroom. Assistant D.A. RACHEL DAWES, look up, ANNOYED.

DENT
Sorry I'm late, folks.

Rachel leans in to Dent, speaking under her breath.

RACHEL
Where were you?

DENT
Worried you'd have to step up?

RACHEL
I know the briefs backwards.

Dent pulls a large silver dollar out of his pocket.	Grins.

DENT
Well, then, fair's fair: heads, I'll take it. Tails, he's all yours.

Dent FLIPS.	Shows it to Rachel- heads.

RACHEL
You're flipping coins to see who

leads?
 
16.


DENT
My father's lucky coin. As I recall, it got me my first date with you.

RACHEL
I'm serious, Harvey, you don't leave things like this to chance.

DENT
I	don't.

(sincere)

I make my own luck.

Dent looks across at the defendant- SAL MARONI.

MARONI
I thought the DA just played golf

with the Mayor, things like that.

DENT
Tee-off's 1:30.	More than enough
time to put you away for life, Sally.

The BAILIFFS lead a THIN MAN into the witness box.	ROSSI.

INT. COURTROOM, SUPERIOR COURT -- DAY

Rossi takes a SIP of water.	Dent works the room.

DENT
With Carmine Falcone in Arkham, someone must've stepped up to run the so-called family.
(Rossi nods)
Is this man in the courtroom today?
(Rossi nods again)
Could you identify him for us,
please?

Dent turns to Maroni, who is poker-faced.	Dent smiles.

ROSSI
You win, counselor.	It was me.

Dent's smile disappears.	He turns back to Rossi.

DENT
I've got a sworn statement from you that this man, Salvatore Maroni, is the new head of the Falcone crime family.

ROSSI
Maroni? He's a fall guy. I'm the brains of the organization.

LAUGHS from the gallery.	Dent turns to the JUDGE.
 
17.


DENT
Permission to treat the witness as hostile?

ROSSI
Hostile?	I'll show you hostile.

Rossi JUMPS UP, points a GUN at Dent's face. SCREAMS from the gallery. Rossi PULLS the TRIGGER- the gun MISFIRES with a POP. Dent steps forward, grabs the GUN- DECKS Rossi with a RIGHT CROSS- unloads the GUN and sets it down in front of Maroni.

DENT
Ceramic 28 caliber.	Made in China.
If you want to kill a public servant,
Mr. Maroni, I recommend you buy
American.

Everyone STARES, open-mouthed, as Dent adjusts his tie. The Bailiffs are wrestling Rossi from the box-

DENT (CONT’D)
But, your honor, I'm not done...

INT. LOBBY, DENT'S OFFICE, DA'S -- DAY

Rachel, excited, leads Dent through the lobby.

RACHEL
We'll never link the gun to Maroni, so we can't charge him, but I'll tell you one thing- the fact they tried to kill you means we're getting to them.

DENT
Glad you're so pleased, Rachel. I'm fine by the way.

Rachel turns to Dent.	Smooths his lapels.

RACHEL
Harvey, you're Gotham's D.A.- if you're not getting shot at, you're not doing your job.
(smiles)
'Course if you said you were rattled we could take the rest of the day...

DENT
Can't.	I dragged the head of the
Major Crimes Unit down here.

RACHEL
Jim Gordon? He's a friend- try to be nice.
 
18.


INT. DENT'S OFFICE -- DAY

Gordon stands as Dent enters.	The two men shake.

GORDON
Word is you've got a hell of a right cross. Shame Sal's going to walk.

DENT
Well, good thing about the mob is they keep giving you second chances.

Dent picks up a bundle of bills from the heist.

DENT
Lightly irradiated bills.	Fancy

stuff for a city cop.	Have help?

GORDON
We liaise with various agencies-

DENT
Save it, Gordon.	I want to meet him.

GORDON
Official policy is to arrest the vigilante known as Batman on sight.

DENT
And that flood light on top of

M.C.U.?

GORDON
If you have any concerns about... malfunctioning equipment... take them up with maintenance, counselor.

Dent tosses the bills back onto his desk.	Annoyed.

DENT
I've put every known money launderer in Gotham behind bars. But the mob is still getting its money out. I think you and your "friend" have found the last game in town and you're trying to hit 'em where it hurts: their wallets. Bold. You gonna count me in?

GORDON
In this town, the fewer people know something, the safer the operation.

DENT
Gordon, I don't like that you've got your own special unit, and I don't like that it's full of cops I investigated at internal affairs.
 
19.


GORDON
If I didn't work with cops you'd investigated while you were making your name at I.A.- I'd be working alone. I don't get political points for being an idealist- I have to do the best I can with what I have.

Dent looks at Gordon.	Considering how to proceed.

DENT
You want me to back warrants for search and seizure on five banks without telling me who we're after?

GORDON
I can give you the names of the

banks.

DENT
Well, that's a start. I'll get you your warrants. But I want your trust.

GORDON
(rises)

You don't have to sell me, Dent. We all know you're Gotham's white knight.

DENT
(grins)
I hear they've got a different

nickname for me down at M.C.U..

Gordon smiles.

INT. BOARDROOM, WAYNE ENTERPRISES -- DAY

LUCIUS FOX, CEO of Wayne Enterprises, and the board listen to LAU, 40s, CEO of L.S.I. Holdings.

LAU
In China L.S.I. Holdings stands for dynamic new growth. A joint Chinese venture with Wayne Enterprises will be a powerhouse.

FOX
Well, Mr.Lau, I speak for the rest of the board, and Mr.Wayne, in expressing our own excitement...

The Chinese look to the head of the table: Wayne, ASLEEP.
 
20.


INT. HALLWAY, WAYNE ENTERPRISES -- DAY

Fox shows Lau to the elevator. He's joined by, REESE, 30s, an ambitious M and A consultant lawyer.

LAU
It's OK, Mr.Fox. Everyone knows who really runs Wayne Enterprises.

FOX
We'll be in touch as soon as our people have wrapped up the diligence.

The elevator doors close.	Reese frowns.

REESE
Sir, I know Mr.Wayne's curious how his trust fund gets replenished but frankly... it's embarrassing.

Fox heads for his office, Reese in tow.

FOX
You worry about the diligence, Mr.

Reese.	I'll worry about Bruce Wayne.

REESE
It's done- the numbers are solid.

FOX
(smiles)

Do it again. Wouldn't want the trust fund to run out, would we?

INT. BOARDROOM, WAYNE ENTERPRISES -- CONTINUOUS

Wayne is standing by the window.

FOX
Another long night?
(Wayne smiles)

This joint venture was your idea, and the consultants love it, but I'm not convinced. L.S.I.'s grown 8 percent annually, like clockwork. They must have a revenue stream that's off the books. Maybe even illegal.

WAYNE
OK.	Cancel the deal.

FOX
(looks at Wayne)

You already knew.

WAYNE
I needed a closer look at their

books.
 
21.


Fox looks at Wayne.	Wry.

FOX
Anything else you can trouble me for?

WAYNE
I need a new suit.

FOX
(looks him over)

Three buttons is a little nineties.

WAYNE
I'm not talking about fashion,

Mr.Fox, so much as function.

Wayne pulls some diagrams.	Fox looks them over.

FOX
You want to be able to turn your

head?

WAYNE
Sure make backing out of the driveway easier.

FOX
I'll see what I can do.

INT. RESTAURANT -- NIGHT

Rachel and Dent at a table. Dent looks a little intimidated by the surroundings.

DENT
It took three weeks to get a reservation and I had to tell them I worked for the government.

RACHEL
Really?

DENT
This city health inspector's not

afraid to pull strings.

Rachel smiles. Then, over Dent's shoulder, she sees Wayne enter, accompanied by a beautiful woman.

DENT
What?

WAYNE
Rachel!	Fancy that.

RACHEL
Yes, Bruce.	Fancy that.
 
22.


WAYNE
Rachel, Natascha.	Natascha, Rachel.

NATASCHA
(Russian accent)

Hello.

DENT
The famous Bruce Wayne.	Rachel's
told me everything about you.

WAYNE
I certainly hope not.

RACHEL
Bruce, this is Harvey Dent.

WAYNE
Let's put a couple tables together.

DENT
I don't know if they'll let us-

WAYNE
They should!	I own the place.

RACHEL
For how long?	About three weeks?

WAYNE
How'd you know?

RACHEL
Natascha, aren't you...?

WAYNE
Prima ballerina for the Moscow

Ballet.

RACHEL
Harvey's taking me next week.

WAYNE
You're into ballet, Harvey?

RACHEL
No.	He knows I am.

An extra table arrives.

INT. SAME -- LATER

They finish up dinner.

NATASCHA
No, come on- how could you want to raise children in a city like this?
 
23.


WAYNE
I was raised here.	I turned out OK.

DENT
Is Wayne Manor in the city limits?

Rachel gives Dent a withering look.

WAYNE
The Palisades? Sure. You know, as our new D.A. you might want to figure out where your jurisdiction ends.

NATASCHA
I'm talking about the kind of city that idolizes a masked vigilante...

DENT
Gotham's proud of an ordinary man

standing up for what's right.

NATASCHA
Gotham needs heroes like you- elected officials, not a man who thinks he's above the law.

WAYNE
Exactly.	Who appointed the Batman?

DENT
We did. All of us who stood by and let scum take control of our city.

Wayne watches Dent.	Sees his passion.

NATASCHA
But this is a democracy, Harvey.

DENT
When their enemies were at the gate, the Romans would suspend democracy and appoint one man to protect the city. It wasn't considered an honor. It was considered public service.

RACHEL
And the last man they asked to protect the republic was named Caesar. He never gave up that power.

DENT
Well, I guess you either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain. Look, whoever the Batman is, he doesn't want to spend the rest of his life doing this. How could he?
(MORE)
 
24.
DENT (cont'd)
~Batman's looking for someone to take up his mantle.

NATASCHA
Someone like you, Mr.Dent?

DENT
Maybe.	If I'm up to it.

Natascha reaches up and covers the top half of Dent's face.

NATASCHA
But what if Harvey Dent is the caped crusader?

DENT
If I were sneaking out every night someone would've noticed by now.

Dent takes Rachel's hand.	Rachel glances at Wayne.	Awkward.

WAYNE
Well, you've sold me, Dent.	I'm
gonna throw you a fundraiser.

DENT
That's nice of you, Bruce, but I'm not up for reelection for three years. That stuff won't start for-

WAYNE
I don't think you understand. One fundraiser with my pals, you'll never need another cent.

EXT. BACK ALLEY, HOTEL, DOWNTOWN -- DAY

A line of high-end AUTOS dispenses well dressed GANGSTERS.

INT. KITCHEN, HOTEL -- DAY

The Chechen walks through a METAL DETECTOR manned by two CHINESE. A lean, African-American man, 50's, is being wanded. This is GAMBOL. He nods at the Chechen, wary.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM, HOTEL -- CONTINUOUS
 

Gotham's most notorious GANGSTERS.
BURLY CHINESE enter, carrying a TV.
end of the table.
 


A door opens, and two They set it down on the

 
CRIME BOSS
The hell is this...?

The screen flickers to life: Lau.	The room ERUPTS.
 
25.


LAU (ON T.V.)
Gentlemen, please. As you're all
aware, one of our deposits was
stolen.	A relatively small amount:
68 million.

CHECHEN
Who's stupid enough steal from us?

LAU
I'm told the man who arranged the
heist calls himself Joker.

CHECHEN
Who the hell is that?

MARONI
Two-bit whack-job wears a cheap
purple suit and make-up.	He's not
the problem- he's a nobody.
(looks at Lau)
The problem is our money being

tracked by the cops.

Murmurs of surprise.

LAU
Thanks to Mr.Maroni's well-placed
sources we know that police have
indeed identified our banks using
marked bills and are planning to
seize your funds today-

Everyone starts SHOUTING at once.

EXT. VARIOUS DOWNTOWN BANKS -- CONTINUOUS

Gordon sits in a SWAT van outside a bank.	Stephens is
outside another.	Ramirez a third...

SWAT teams CHECK WEAPONS and prepare move...

INT. SOCIAL CLUB, DOWNTOWN -- CONTINUOUS

Lau waits for the noise to subside.

CHECHEN
You promised safe, clean money

launder-

LAU
With the investigation ongoing, none of you can risk hanging on to your own proceeds. And since the enthusiastic new D.A. has put all my competitors out of business, I'm your only option.
 
26.


MARONI
So what are you proposing?

LAU
Moving all deposits to one secure
location.	Not a bank.

GAMBOL
Where, then?

LAU
Obviously, no one can know but me. If the police were to gain leverage over one of you everyone's money would be at stake.

CHECHEN
What stops them getting to you?

LAU
As the money is moved I go to Hong Kong. Far from Dent's jurisdiction. And the Chinese will not extradite one of their own.

From the back of the room comes LAUGHTER. It grows and grows, until it fills the room. All eyes turn:

The Joker. Sweaty clown makeup obscuring the AWFUL SCARS which widen his mouth into a PERMANENT, GHOULISH SMILE.

THE JOKER
I thought I told bad jokes.

GAMBOL
Give me one reason I shouldn't have my boy here pull your head off.

The Joker pulls out a freshly sharpened pencil.

THE JOKER
How about a magic trick?

The Joker SLAMS the pencil into the table, leaving it
UPRIGHT.

THE JOKER (CONT’D)
I'll make this pencil disappear.

Gambol nods. His BODYGUARD MOVES at the Joker- who SIDESTEPS-GRIPS his head- SLAMS it, FACE DOWN, onto the table...

The Bodyguard goes LIMP and slides off of the table. The PENCIL is gone. MAGIC. The Joker BOWS. Grins at Gambol.
 
27.


THE JOKER (CONT’D) And by the way, the suit wasn't cheap. You should know. You bought it.

Gambol STANDS, furious.	The Chechen stops him.

CHECHEN
Sit.	I wanna hear proposition.

The Joker nods his thanks.	Rises.

THE JOKER
A year ago these cops and lawyers wouldn't dare cross any of you. What happened? Did your balls drop off? See, a guy like me-

GAMBOL
A freak.

Laughs.	Which the Joker tries to ignore.

THE JOKER
A guy like me... I know why you're holding your little group therapy session in broad daylight. I know why you're afraid to go out at night. Batman. He's shown Gotham your true colors. And Dent's just the beginning.
(indicates Lau)
And as for his so-called plan- Batman has no jurisdiction. He'll find him and make him squeal.
(smiles at Lau)
I can tell the squealers every time.

CHECHEN
What you propose?

THE JOKER
It's simple.	Kill the Batman.

Jeers.	Laughter.

MARONI
If it's so easy why haven't you done it already?

THE JOKER
Like my mother used to tell me- if you're good at something, never do it for free.

CHECHEN
How much you want?
 
28.


THE JOKER
Half.

Laughter.	The Joker shrugs.	Rises.

THE JOKER (CONT’D)
You don't deal with this now, soon Gambol won't even be able to get a nickel for his grandma-

GAMBOL
Enough from the clown.

Gambol gets up, MOVING at the Joker, who casually opens his coat, revealing EXPLOSIVES wired to his chest. Gambol stops.

THE JOKER
Let's not blow this out of all

proportion.

Gambol stares at the Joker.	Hard.

GAMBOL
You think you can steal from us and just walk away? I'm putting the word out- 5 hundred grand for this clown dead. A million alive, so I get to teach him some manners, first.

The Joker shrugs.	Turns to the assembled.

THE JOKER
Let me know when you change your

minds.

The Joker strolls out.	Maroni turns to Lau.

MARONI
How soon can you move the money?

EXT. VARIOUS BANKS DOWNTOWN -- CONTINUOUS

Gordon hurries up the steps to a bank. SWAT teams rush the various banks.

LAU
I already have...

EXT. UNDERPASS, GOTHAM -- CONTINUOUS

A CHINESE MAN finishes loading a TRACTOR TRAILER with cash boxes. The truck pulls out into a CONVOY.

INT. BANK VAULT -- CONTINUOUS

Gordon stands in an almost empty bank vault.	Furious.
