LAU
For obvious reasons I couldn't wait for your permission...

INT. SOCIAL CLUB, DOWNTOWN -- CONTINUOUS

The shot of Lau on the TV widens...

LAU
Rest assured, your money is safe.

He is already on his private jet.

IN THE SKY: THE BAT SIGNAL.

EXT. ROOF, POLICE STATION -- NIGHT

Batman emerges from the shadows. The man next to the glowing spotlight turns: DENT.

DENT
You're a hard man to reach.

Gordon BURSTS onto the rooftop, weapon drawn.	Sees Dent.

DENT
Lau's halfway to Hong Kong- if you'd asked, I could have taken his passport- I told you to keep me in the loop.

GORDON
Yeah? All that was left in the vaults were the marked bills- they knew we were coming! As soon as your office got involved, there's a leak-

DENT
My office?! You're sitting down here with scum like Wuertz and Ramirez...
(off look)
Oh, yeah, Gordon- I almost had your rookie cold on a racketeering beef.

GORDON
Don't try to cloud the fact that clearly Maroni's got people in your office, Dent.

Dent turns to Batman.

DENT
We need Lau back, but the Chinese won't extradite a national under any circumstances.
 
30.


BATMAN
If I get him to you, can you get him to talk?

DENT
I'll get him to sing.

GORDON
We're going after the mob's life

savings.	Things will get ugly.

DENT
I knew the risks when I took this
job, lieutenant.	Same as you.
(turns to Batman)

How will you get him back, anyway?

Batman is gone.	Dent looks around, startled.	Gordon smirks.

GORDON
He does that.

INT. FOX'S OFFICE, WAYNE INDUSTRIES -- DAY

Fox gets up from behind his desk.

FOX
Our Chinese friend left town before I could tell him the deal is off.

WAYNE
I'm sure you've always wanted to go to Hong Kong.

Fox opens the door to a private elevator. INT. PRIVATE ELEVATOR -- CONTINUOUS Fox turns a key.
FOX

What's wrong with a phone call?

WAYNE
I think Mr.Lau deserves a more

personal touch.

INT. APPLIED SCIENCES DIVISION -- CONTINUOUS

Fox leads Wayne off the elevator and into the vast space.

FOX
For high altitude jumps, you need oxygen and stabilizers. I must say-compared to your usual requests, jumping out of an airplane is pretty straightforward.
 
31.


Lucius stops at a cabinet, pulls open a drawer and hauls out an oxygen tank and ribbed rubber hosing.

WAYNE
How about getting back into the

plane?

FOX
I can recommend a good travel agent.

WAYNE
Without it landing.

FOX
That's more like it, Mr.Wayne.

He shuts the drawer.	Moves off, thinking.

FOX
I don't think I have anything here. The CIA had a program in the '60s for getting their people out of hot spots. Called Sky Hook. Now-

Fox opens a cabinet to reveal COMPONENTS OF A NEW BAT-SUIT.
ARMORED PLATING secured to mesh.	Wayne lifts an arm.

FOX
Hardened kevlar plates on a titanium-dipped fiber tri-weave for flexibility...

Wayne examines DOUBLE BLADE SCALLOPS on the gauntlet...

FOX
You'll be lighter, faster, more

agile...

Wayne flinches as the BLADES FIRE, SPINNING LIKE THROWING STARS, NARROWLY MISSING his ear, embedding themselves in a filing cabinet. Fox looks at him.

FOX
Perhaps you should read the

instructions, first.

WAYNE
Sorry.

Fox picks up the chest, demonstrating its flexibility.

FOX
Now, there's a trade-off... the spread of the plates gives you weak spots. You'll be more vulnerable to gunfire and knives.
 
32.


WAYNE
We wouldn't want things getting too easy, would we?
(picks up suit)

How will it hold up against dogs?

Fox looks at him quizzically.

FOX
You talking chihuahuas or rotweilers?
(Wayne smiles)

It should do fine against cats.

INT. BAT-BUNKER -- DAY

Wayne examines a parachute harness. Alfred unfolds a diagram of a NAVY CARGO PLANE with a giant "V" mounted on the front.

ALFRED
I found one. In Arizona. Very nice man says it will take him a week to get it running. And he takes cash. What about a flight crew?

WAYNE
South Korean smugglers. They run flights into Pyongyang, below radar the whole way. Did you think of an alibi?

Alfred looks quite pleased with himself.

ALFRED
Oh, yes.

EXT. BALLET -- NIGHT

Rachel and Dent arrive to find the box office SHUTTERED. A sign:'PERFORMANCE CANCELED.' A newspaper story is taped to the glass. Over a picture of BRUCE WAYNE ON A YACHT:

LOVE BOAT- Billionaire absconds with entire Moscow ballet. EXT. DECK, WAYNE'S YACHT, THE CARIBBEAN -- DAY

Alfred, picks his way over twelve SUNBATHING BALLERINAS. Wayne looks up from a newspaper. Alfred points to a SEA-PLANE gently touching down across the bay.

ALFRED
I believe your plane is here.

WAYNE
You look tired, Alfred. Will you be all right without me?

A Ballerina rolls over- waves the suntan lotion at Alfred.
 
33.


ALFRED
If you can tell me the Russian for 'apply your own bloody suntan lotion.â€™

Wayne tosses a large, waterproof kit bag into the water and JUMPS in after it. Begins swimming over to the sea-plane.

INT. POOL HALL -- NIGHT

Gambol racks up.	A bodyguard steps into the room.

BODYGUARD
Somebody here for you.

Gambol looks to the back- three rough customers are waiting.

BODYGUARD
They say they've killed the Joker.

They've come for the reward.

GAMBOL
They bring proof?

BODYGUARD
They say they've brought the body.

The bodyguards FLOP a BODY wrapped in garbage bags onto the table. The BOUNTY HUNTERS wait in the corner. Gambol pulls back one of the garbage bags, revealing the Joker's bloodied face. Gambol spits. Turns to face the bounty hunters.

GAMBOL
So.	Dead you get five hundred-

Behind Gambol, the Joker SITS UP- THRUSTS knives into the bodyguards' chests. Gambol spins to see a crazy grin on the Joker's spit-dribbled face-

THE JOKER
How about alive?

The Joker gets a switchblade in Gambol's mouth- SHARP METAL PULLING THE CHEEK TAUT. The Bounty Hunters subdue the remaining bodyguards.

THE JOKER
Wanna know how I got these scars? My father was a drinker and a fiend. He'd beat mommy right in front of me. One night he goes off crazier than usual, mommy gets the kitchen knife to defend herself. He doesn't like that. Not. One. Bit.

The Joker TUGS Gambols cheek with the blade.
 
34.


THE JOKER
So, me watching, he takes the knife to her, laughing while he does it. Turns to me and says 'why so serious?' Comes at me with the knife-'why so serious?' Sticks the blade in my mouth- 'Let's put a smile on that face' and...

The Joker looks up at the ASHEN FACES of the remaining Body Guards. Smiles.

THE JOKER
Why so serious?

The Joker FLICKS his wrist- the Body Guards flinch as Gambol goes down. The Joker turns to them.

THE JOKER
Now, our organization is small, but we've got a lot of potential for aggressive expansion... so which of you fine gentlemen would like to join our team?

The three bodyguards all nod.	The Joker SNAPS a pool cue.

THE JOKER
Only one slot open right now- so

we're going to have try-outs.

The Joker drops the broken cue in the middle of the men.

THE JOKER
Make it fast.

The men stare at each other.	Then at the jagged pool cue.

EXT.PENINSULA HOTEL, HONG KONG -- DAY

A HELICOPTER touches down on one of the hotel's twin helipads. Two L.S.I. VPs approach, heads ducked. Fox gets out- they shake hands, shouting over the engine-

VP
Welcome to Hong Kong, Mr.Fox! Mr.Lau regrets he is unable to meet you in person. But with his current legal difficulties...!

FOX
I understand!

INT. LOBBY, L.S.I.HOLDINGS -- DAY The VPs usher Fox towards security.
 
35.


VP
I'm afraid for security reasons I have to ask for your mobile phone.

Lucius hands his phone to a SECURITY GUARD, who puts the phone in a box underneath his station.

INT. L.S.I.HOLDINGS -- DAY

Fox and Lau eat lunch in a dining room overlooking the city.

LAU
I must apologize for leaving Gotham in the middle of our negotiations. This misunderstanding with the Gotham police force... I couldn't let such a thing threaten my company. A businessman of your stature will understand. But with you here... we can continue.

FOX
Well, it was good of you to bring me out here in such style, Mr.Lau. But I've actually come...

A CELL PHONE rings. Fox pulls out a second, identical, phone. Fox presses the off switch and places the phone by his plate.

LAU
We do not allow cell phones in-

FOX
Sorry. Forgot I had it. So, I've come to explain why we're going to have to put our deal on hold...

Lau stares at Fox.	Clearly furious.	Fox smiles.

FOX
We can't afford to be seen to do business with... well, whatever it is you're accused of being. A businessman of your stature will understand.

Lau gets up.	Silent.	Fox retrieves his phone.	Stands.

LAU
(cold)

I think, Mr.Fox, that a simple phone call might have sufficed.
 
36.


FOX
Well, I do love Chinese food. And Mr.Wayne didn't want you to think we'd been deliberately wasting your time.

LAU
Just accidentally wasting it.

FOX
(laughs)

That's very good- "accidentally". Very good. I'll be sure and tell Mr.Wayne that he was wrong about you not having a sense of humor.

INT. LOBBY, L.S.I.HOLDINGS -- DAY

Lucius walks back through security. Nods at the VP, who bows, offering Lucius his cell phone. Lucius shakes his head, holds up the IDENTICAL PHONE. The VP smiles, nods, puts the phone back into the tray with several others.

INT. HOLD, C-130 CARGO HAULER -- DAWN

Two SMUGGLERS steal glances at Wayne, crouched at the rear in balaclava and flight suit. The COPILOT signals Wayne, who pulls on his oxygen mask and stands up. The rear of the plane OPENS. Wayne steps to the edge, then JUMPS.

EXT. SKIES ABOVE HONG KONG -- DAWN

Moving across the water towards Hong Kong harbor...

A tiny figure DROPS into frame, PLUMMETING towards the water-SPEEDING past the highest floors of skyscrapers, seconds from impact. Wayne PULLS the chute- DROPS into the water...

EXT. BENEATH FREEWAY, HONG KONG HARBOR -- DAY

Wayne pulls himself out of the water, dragging up his pack.

EXT. CENTRAL ESCALATORS -- DAY

Wayne stops halfway up the crowded commuter escalator. He takes a camera and lines up a shot like any tourist.

FOX (O.S.)
There's a better view from the peak tram.

Wayne turns to find Fox standing there, street map out.

WAYNE
How's the view from L.S.I.Holdings?
 
37.


FOX
Restricted. Lau's holed up in there good and tight. Here...

Fox shows Wayne the phone. The display: a 3-d map of Lau's office suite. Wayne takes the phone, impressed.

WAYNE
What's this?

FOX
I had R and D work it up- it sends out high frequencies and records the response time to map an environment.

WAYNE
(smiles)

Sonar.	Just like a b-

FOX
Submarine.	Like a submarine.

WAYNE
And the other device?

FOX
In place.

Wayne nods, moves away.

FOX
Mr.Wayne?
(Wayne turns)

Good luck.

EXT. HONG KONG -- NIGHT

Moving towards the tallest building in the glittering skyline to find Wayne, crouched on the roof. The blades of his gauntlets CLICK into place. He dons the helmet-like cowl. His "cape" is in the form of a hard faceted PACK.

He stands- pulls two black boxes from his belt, CLICKS them together and UNFOLDS them into a RIFLE-LIKE DEVICE. Batman SCOPES a second, lower building. Adjust a setting and FIRES-four times...

Four small STICKY BOMBS SLAP onto the glass of the lower building. They have visible timers which are COUNTING DOWN.

INT. LOBBY, L.S.I.HOLDINGS -- NIGHT

Lucius' cell phone GLOWS in the box under the Security Guard's desk. CHARACTERS race across the screen.

Then the monitor FLICKERS off, the lights DIM and all of the security doors in the front of the building OPEN at once.
 
38.


The Guard grabs his radio- CALLS FOR HELP...

EXT. ROOFTOP OVERLOOKING L.S.I.HOLDINGS

Batman LAUNCHES into the glittering night, DROPPING from the tall tower... his pack BURSTS OPEN, becoming his BAT WINGS-he GLIDES down to the lower building, STREAKING around it, BANKING HARD to line up with a window in the rear...

INT. LAU'S OFFICE, L.S.I.HOLDINGS -- NIGHT

Lau is talking on the phone, staring at a profit projection on a flat screen monitor. Suddenly the room goes dark.

EXT. L.S.I.HOLDINGS -- CONTINUOUS

As Batman HURTLES towards the glass he COLLAPSES his wings, WRAPPING his cape around himself and CANNONBALLING THROUGH THE GLASS-

INT. LAU'S OFFICE SUITE, L.S.I.HOLDINGS -- NIGHT

-ROLLING across the floor in a flurry of broken glass...

INT. LAU'S OFFICE, TOP FLOOR, L.S.I.HOLDINGS -- NIGHT Lau pulls out a HANDGUN.

INT. HALLWAY, L.S.I.HOLDINGS -- NIGHT

Lau steps into the hallway. His BODYGUARDS are waiting for him, carrying FLASHLIGHTS.

LAU
Where the hell are the cops?

BODYGUARD
Coming.

LAU
What the hell am I paying them for?

They head for the stairwell.

EXT. L.S.I.HOLDINGS -- NIGHT

A small ARMY of Hong Kong police lead by a HONG KONG DETECTIVE descends on the building.

INT. MEZZANINE LEVEL, L.S.I.HOLDINGS -- NIGHT

Lau and his men make their way out onto the mezzanine.

Across the room, something makes a CRASHING SOUND. Lau's men fan out, trying to cover the room with their flashlights.

Suddenly, one of the flashlights goes DARK.	Then another.
Someone SCREAMS.
 
39.


Lau FIRES. Then FIRES again. The muzzle flash from his weapon STROBES the room.

EXT. L.S.I.HOLDINGS, HONG KONG -- NIGHT

Cops SWARM into the building.	A LOBBY SECURITY GUARD directs
the Hong Kong Detective where to go...

INT. OFFICE, L.S.I.HOLDINGS -- NIGHT

Lau LOCKS the door. RELOADS. The door is KICKED open. Lau FIRES. No one is there.

Lau stares, finger restless on the trigger. From his right-a NOISE. He turns and FIRES.

In the muzzle FLASH: Batman, bearing down on him like a demon.

Lau FIRES, and FIRES again as Batman TACKLES him. Batman pulls out a SMALL PACK- STRAPS it onto Lau-

The COUNTER on the sticky bombs hits 0-

The Hong Kong Detective and the Cops BURST into the room- the WALL AND CEILING BEHIND BATMAN AND LAU EXPLODES- revealing the dawn sky above Hong Kong.

The Detective looks around as he hears a LOW RUMBLE...

Batman JERKS the RIPCORD on Lau's pack. Cops cower as a WEATHER BALLOON EXPLODES out of the pack, unreeling high-test nylon. The Cops cock their weapons.

Lau looks up. Bemused. The weather balloon is two hundred feet up, swaying gently. The RUMBLE BUILDS...

Suddenly, a MASSIVE C-130 ROARS over. The large V on the front of the plane SNAGS the line- Lau and BATMAN are YANKED THROUGH THE HOLE IN THE CEILING-

Lau SCREAMS as he and Batman SOAR UP INTO THE DAWN SKY...

The Detective looks up.	Batman and Lau are gone.

INT. GORDON'S OFFICE, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- DAY

Gordon is looking through case files.	Ramirez walks in.

RAMIREZ
You're gonna want to see this.

EXT. MCU -- DAY

Gordon follows Ramirez through a CROWD of excited cops. On the ground, trussed like a chicken- Lau. A sign taped to his chest: 'Please deliver to Lieutenant Gordon.'
 
40.


INT. INTERROGATION ROOM, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- DAY

Lau sits next to his sleazy lawyer, EVANS.	Rachel walks in.

RACHEL
Give us the money and we'll deal.

LAU
The money is the only reason I'm

still alive.

Rachel leans forward, speaking softly.	Clearly.

RACHEL
You mean when they hear that you've helped us they're going to kill you?

EVANS
Are you threatening my client?

RACHEL
No, I'm just assuming your client's cooperation with this investigation. As will everyone.
(moves to the door)
Enjoy your stay in County, Mr.Lau.

LAU
Wait.
(Rachel stops)

I won't give you the money, but I'll give you my clients. All of them.

RACHEL
You were a glorified accountant- what could you have on all of them that we could charge?

LAU
I'm good with calculation- I handled all their investments. One big pot.

INT. OBSERVATION ROOM, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- DAY

Dent hits a buzzer.	Turns to Gordon.

DENT
I've got it. RICO. If their money was pooled we can charge all of them as one criminal conspiracy.

GORDON
Charge them with what?

Rachel enters.
 
41.


DENT
In a RICO case if we can charge any of the conspirators with a felony-

RACHEL
We can charge all of them with it.

Dent nods at Rachel, excited.

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- DAY

Rachel comes back in.

RACHEL
Mr.Lau, do you have details of this communal fund? Ledgers, notebooks...?

LAU
(smiles)

Immunity, protection and a chartered plane back to Hong Kong.

RACHEL
Once you've testified in open court. So with your clients locked up, what happens to all that money?

LAU
Like I said- I'm good with

calculation.

INT. OBSERVATION ROOM, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- CONTINUOUS

Dent and Gordon watch Lau.

GORDON
He can't go to County. I'll keep him here in the holding cells.

DENT
What is this Gordon, your fortress?

GORDON
You trust them over at County?

DENT
I don't trust them here.

GORDON
Lau stays.

DENT
It's your call, Lieutenant.	Be
right.

GORDON
I am, counselor.
 
42.


EXT. CITY HALL -- DAY

Dent stands in front of a small crowd of reporters.

REPORTER
The Chinese government claim their international rights have been broken.

DENT
I don't know about Mr. Lau's travel arrangements...

INT. RESTAURANT -- CONTINUOUS

Dent's press conference plays on a TV in the corner.

DENT
(grins)
...but I'm sure glad he's back.

Maroni and the Chechen are watching the TV.

CHECHEN
I put word out.	We hire the clown.
(off look)

He was right. We have to fix real problem. Batman.

Maroni shakes his head. Spots Gordon walking over dangling a pair of handcuffs. Nods at the TV.

GORDON
Our boy looks good on the tube.

MARONI
You sure you want to embarrass me in front of my friends, Lieutenant?

GORDON
Don't worry, they're coming, too.

Gordon points out the window to a PRISON BUS.

EXT. VARIOUS DOWNTOWN AND OUTLYING LOCATIONS -- DAY

Prison buses in every neighborhood. COPS load them with CRIMINALS. Stephens puts Crime Boss in a prison bus.

INT. COURTROOM A, GOTHAM MUNICIPAL COURTHOUSE -- DAY

JUDGE SURRILLO reads the list of charges.

JUDGE SURRILLO
...849 counts racketeering, 246 counts fraud, 87 counts conspiracy murder...
 
43.


Judge Surrillo turns the page. A PLAYING CARD sits there. A Joker. He glances at it, curious, puts it to one side.

JUDGE SURRILLO
...how do the defendants plead?

An ARMY of DEFENSE LAWYERS jostle YELLING ALL AT ONCE. The STENOGRAPHER looks up, helpless.

INT. MAYOR'S OFFICE -- DAY

The MAYOR, COMMISSIONER LOEB, and Gordon look up as Dent enters.

MAYOR
DENT!	What was that circus?!

DENT
I asked Gordon to make some arrests.

LOEB
(looks at report)

Five hundred and-

GORDON
Forty-nine, sir.

Gordon nods at Dent, approving.	Dent grins back.

MAYOR
549 criminals at once?! How did you convince Surrillo to hear this farce?

DENT
She shares my enthusiasm for justice.

After all, she is a judge.

MAYOR
Even if you blow enough smoke to get convictions out of Surrillo, you'll set a new record at appeals for quickest kick in the ass.

DENT
It won't matter. The head guys make bail, sure... but the mid-level guys, they can't, and they can't afford to be off the streets long enough for trial and appeal. They'll cut deals that include some jail time. Think of all you could do with 18 months of clean streets.

The Mayor waves Gordon and Loeb out.

MAYOR
The public likes you, Dent. That's the only reason this might fly.

(MORE)
 
44.
MAYOR (cont'd)
But that means it's on you. They're all coming after you, now. Not just the mob... politicians, journalists, cops- anyone whose wallet's about to get lighter. Are you up to it?
(Dent smiles)
You better be. They get anything on you... those criminals will be back on the streets...

The Mayor turns to look out of the window.	Quiet.

MAYOR
Followed swiftly by you and me-

BANG!	A DARK SHAPE CRACKS THE GLASS in front of the Mayor's
nose.	Dent rushes to the window, looks out...

EXT. CITY HALL -- CONTINUOUS

PEDESTRIANS look up, someone SCREAMS, someone POINTS- five
stories up... SWINGING from a FLAGPOLE...

BATMAN. HANGING BY HIS NECK. DEAD. His mouth roughly painted in a DEMONIC CLOWN SMILE.

EXT. CITY HALL -- MOMENTS LATER

"Batman" is lowered from the flagpole. The same fake Batman we saw earlier. Pinned to his chest by a KNIFE, a PLAYING CARD. A Joker. Gordon moves closer to the body. The card has writing on it: WILL THE REAL BATMAN PLEASE STAND UP?

INT. WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- DAY

Wayne comes into the living room, excited. Alfred is supervising party arrangements.

WAYNE
How's it going?

ALFRED
I think your fundraiser will be a

great success, sir.

WAYNE
And why do you think I wanted to hold a party for Harvey Dent?

ALFRED
I assumed it was your usual reason for socialising beyond myself and the scum of Gotham's underbelly: to try and impress Miss Dawes.

WAYNE
Very droll.	But very wrong.
Actually it's Dent.	You see-
 
45.


Wayne trails off as he spots something on the television: the Batman HANGING as from a NEWS CAMERA, framed by a graphic that reads 'BATMAN DEAD?'. Image cuts to Engel in the studio.

ENGEL
...Police released video footage
found concealed on the body.
Sensitive viewers be aware: it is

disturbing.

The image cuts to a BLINDFOLDED MAN, wearing a makeshift Batman costume- face bruised and bloody. In some kind of bright, fluorescent-lit room.

VOICE
Tell them your name.

MAN
(weak)

Brian Douglas.

VOICE
Are you the real Batman?

MAN
No.

VOICE
Why do you dress up like him?

MAN
He's a symbol... that we don't have to be afraid of scum like you...

VOICE
But you do, Brian.	You really do.
You think the Batman's helped Gotham?

Brian nods uncertainly...

VOICE
Look at me.

(Brian looks down)

LOOK AT ME!

Brian looks up- the camera swings into the face of the Joker, in CHALK-WHITE makeup, RED SMEAR of lipstick on his SCARS.

THE JOKER
This is how crazy Batman's made Gotham. You want order in Gotham? Batman has to go. So...
(leans in)
Batman must take off his mask, and turn himself in.

(MORE)
 
46.
THE JOKER (cont'd)
Every day he doesn't... people will die. Starting tonight. I'm a man of my word.

The tape cuts to STATIC.

Wayne turns to Alfred.	Silent.

INT. WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- EVENING

Dent and Rachel get off the lift. Dent stands in awe of the penthouse and its guests.

RACHEL
Now I've seen it all: Harvey Dent, scourge of the underworld, scared stiff by the trust fund brigade.

Rachel spots someone and darts off-

DENT
Rachel-

ALFRED
A little liquid courage, Mr.Dent?

Dent turns to see Alfred with drinks on a silver tray.

DENT
Thanks.	Alfred, right?

ALFRED
Yes, sir.

DENT
Rachel talks about you all the time.

You've known her her whole life?

ALFRED
Not yet, sir.

DENT
(smiles, surveys crowd)

Any psychotic ex-boyfriends I should be aware of?

ALFRED
Oh, you have no idea.

Alfred leaves Dent standing there, puzzled. The crowd REACTS as a LOUD ROAR drowns conversation... Dent looks out-

EXT. HELIPAD, WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

Wayne's CHOPPER touches down.	He spills out with a clutch of
SUPERMODELS...
 
47.


INT. WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

Wayne and the supermodels come out of the helipad elevator-

WAYNE
Sorry, I'm late- glad you started

without me!	Where's Rachel?!

Rachel cringes slightly.	Wayne spots her.

WAYNE
Rachel Dawes- my oldest friend. When she told me she was dating Harvey Dent, I had one thing to say... the guy from those god-awful campaign commercials?

Laughter.	Dent shifts, embarrassed.

WAYNE
'I Believe in Harvey Dent.' Nice slogan, Harvey. Certainly caught Rachel's attention. But then I started paying attention to Harvey, and all he's been doing as our new D.A., and you know what? I believe in Harvey Dent. On his watch, Gotham can feel a little safer. A little more optimistic. So get out your checkbooks and let's make sure that he stays right where all of Gotham wants him...
(raises his glass)
All except Gotham's criminals, of
course.	To the face of Gotham's
bright future- Harvey Dent.

Dent smiles accepting the toast.

INT. CORRIDOR, MCU -- EVENING

Ramirez catches up to Gordon, holding paperwork.

RAMIREZ
That Joker card pinned to the body? Forensics found three sets of D.N.A..

GORDON
Any matches?

RAMIREZ
All three.

Gordon STOPS.	Turns to face her.

RAMIREZ
The D.N.A. belongs to Judge Surrillo, Harvey Dent and Commissioner Loeb.
 
48.


GORDON
The Joker's telling us who he's targeting- get a unit to Surrillo's house, tell Wuertz to find Dent- get them both into protective custody. Where's the Commissioner?

RAMIREZ
City hall.

GORDON
Seal the building. No one in or out till I get there.

EXT. DECK, WAYNE'S PENTHOUSE -- EVENING

Wayne walks out to the edge of the balcony and looks over Gotham. Hears someone behind him- Rachel.

RACHEL
Harvey may not know you well enough to understand when you're making fun of him. But I do.

WAYNE
(shakes his head)

I meant every word.

Wayne moves closer to Rachel.	Takes her arm.

WAYNE
The day you once told me about, the day when Gotham no longer needs Batman. It's coming.

Rachel looks at Wayne.	Conflicted.	He moves closer.

RACHEL
You can't ask me to wait for that.

Wayne takes Rachel's arms, looking at her, excited.

WAYNE
It's happening now- Harvey is that hero. He locked up half the city's criminals, and he did it without wearing a mask. Gotham needs a hero with a face.

DENT
You can throw a party, Wayne, I'll give you that. Thanks again. Mind if I borrow Rachel?

Rachel glances back at Wayne as she moves to Dent. Wayne watches them head inside.
 
49.


EXT. STREET, GOTHAM HEIGHTS -- EVENING

Two MEN in suits knock at a Brownstone. The door is opened by Judge Surrillo. The two Men hold up BADGES.

EXT. CITY HALL -- EVENING

Gordon enters through a tight police presence at the doors.

INT. POLICE COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE -- EVENING

Gordon enters to find Loeb, flanked by armed cops.

COMMISSIONER LOEB
Gordon, what are you playing at?

Gordon checks the window.	Turns to his men.

GORDON
We're secure. I want a floor-by-floor search of the entire building.
(turns to Loeb)

I'm sorry, sir. We believe the Joker has made a threat against your life.

LOEB
Gordon, you're unlikely to discover this for yourself, so take my word-the Police Commissioner earns a lot of threats...

Loeb pulls a bottle of whisky and a tumbler from a drawer.

LOEB
I found the appropriate response to these situations a long time ago...

EXT. STREET, GOTHAM HEIGHTS -- EVENING

The second man is waiting by the Judge's car.

SURRILLO
Gordon wants me to go right now?

MAN 1
These are dangerous people, Judge. Even we don't know where you're going.

He hands Surrillo a sealed envelope.	Opens the car door.

MAN 2
Get in, then open the envelope.

It'll tell you where you're headed.

Surrillo climbs in. Watches them drive away. She opens the envelope- pulls out a sheet of paper. One word on it:
 
50.


'UP'.

Surrillo's car EXPLODES, heaving the car upwards on a
FIREBALL.

A PASSERBY is thrown to the ground. After a moment, BURNING DEBRIS flutters down on him. PLAYING CARDS. JOKERS.

INT. POLICE COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS

Loeb pours himself a glass of whisky.

LOEB
You get to explain to my wife why I'm late for dinner, Lieutenant.

GORDON
Sir, the Joker card had a trace of your D.N.A. on it-

A bang at the door.	Gordon pulls his weapon, then opens it.

STEPHENS
Just the normal number of bad guys in the building- and they're all city employees. Here's a list.

LOEB
How'd they get my D.N.A.?

Gordon looks at Stephens's list.

GORDON
Somebody with access to your house or office must've lifted a tissue or a glass...

Gordon, realizing, spins around-

GORDON
Wait-

But Loeb is already CHOKING- he DROPS his tumbler onto the desk- the spilled whiskey is SMOKING, eating into the wood.

GORDON
Get a medic!

Loeb COLLAPSES.

INT. KITCHEN, WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- EVENING

Dent pulls Rachel into the kitchen, away from the crowd.

DENT
You cannot leave me on my own with these people.
 
51.


RACHEL
The whole mob's after you and you're worried about these guys?

DENT
Compared to this, the mob doesn't scare me. Although, I will say: them gunning for you makes you see things clearly.

RACHEL
Oh, yeah?

DENT
Yeah. It makes you think about what you couldn't stand losing. And who you want to spend the rest of your life with...

Rachel looks at Dent.	Smiles.

RACHEL
The rest of your life, huh? That's a pretty big commitment.

DENT
Not if the mob has their way.

RACHEL
Don't.

DENT
Okay. Let's be serious. What's your answer?

Rachel looks at him.

RACHEL
I don't have an answer.

INT.LIVING ROOM, PENTHOUSE -- NIGHT

Half the guests are on their cell phones. An ASSISTANT DA turns to his COLLEAGUE.

ASSISTANT DA
Surrillo and Loeb?

There is a KNOCK at the front door. Alfred opens it it find Detective Wuertz, who holds up his badge. Alfred beckons him in- there is a SHOTGUN at the back of his head held by-

The Joker- purple suit, make up. With friends. The Joker SMASHES Wuertz over the head- steps over him, RACKING the shotgun.
 
52.


THE JOKER
Good evening.	We're the
entertainment.

INT. KITCHEN, WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- NIGHT

Rachel is looking at Dent.	Torn.

DENT
I guess no answer isn't "no".

RACHEL
I'm sorry, Harvey.	I just...

DENT
It's someone else, isn't it?

Wayne is moving up behind him.	Fast-

DENT
Just tell me it's not Wayne.	The
guy's a complete-

Rachel's eyes go wide as Wayne puts Dent in a SLEEPER HOLD-

RACHEL
What are you doing?!

Dent SLUMPS, unconscious in Wayne's arms.

WAYNE
They've come for him.

From the main room- A SHOTGUN BLAST followed by SCREAMS. Wayne stuffs Dent in a closet- puts a mop through the handles. Rushes past Rachel-

WAYNE
Stay hidden.

INT. LIVING ROOM, WAYNE'S PENTHOUSE -- NIGHT

The Joker and his THUGS pour into the room, weapons raised.

INT. HALLWAY, WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- NIGHT

A THUG appears in front of Wayne, toting a shotgun.

THUG
Hands up, pretty boy.

Wayne FLIPS the shotgun around in the man's hands- uses it as a fulcrum to SNAP his forearm- SMASHES him in the jaw with the stock without breaking step, field stripping the shotgun and tossing the pieces in different directions.
 
53.


INT. LIVING ROOM, WAYNE'S PENTHOUSE -- NIGHT

The Joker moves through the terrified guests.	Smiling.

THE JOKER
I only have one question: where is Harvey Dent?
(silence)

I'll settle for his loved ones...

A distinguished Gentleman steps into the Joker's path.

GENTLEMAN
We're not intimidated by thugs.

The Joker stops.	Stares at the man.	SMILES AFFECTIONATELY.

THE JOKER
You know, you remind me of my father.
(GRABS him)

I hated my father.

The Joker has his blade in the Gentleman's mouth.

RACHEL
Stop!

The Joker drops the Gentleman.	Turns to Rachel.

THE JOKER
Hello, beautiful.	You must be
Harvey's squeeze.
(runs his knife across her
cheek)

And you are beautiful. You look nervous- it's the scars isn't it? Wanna know how I got them? I had a wife, beautiful like you. Who tells me I worry too much. Who says I need to smile more. Who gambles. And gets in deep with the sharks. One day they carve her face, and we've got no money for surgeries. She can't take it.
(presses knife into her
cheek)

I just want to see her smile again. I just want her to know I don't care about the scars. So I put a razor in my mouth and do this to myself... And you know what?
(starts laughing)
She can't stand the sight of me...
(or crying)
She leaves! See, now I see the funny side. Now I'm always smiling.
 
54.


INT. MASTER BEDROOM, WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- NIGHT

Wayne walks in. A COUPLE are hastily putting themselves back together, alerted by the noise.

MALE GUEST
What's going on out there, Wayne?

Wayne doesn't answer. He walks into a closet and pulls at a FALSE WALL. Wayne steps into the safe room.

FEMALE GUEST
Thank god- you've got a panic room.

The door SLAMS shut and seals with a HISS.

MALE GUEST
Wait!	You can't-

FEMALE GUEST
You've got to be kidding me.

INT. LIVING ROOM, WAYNE'S PENTHOUSE -- NIGHT

The Joker raises his knife from Rachel's cheek. She SLUGS him. He smiles.

THE JOKER
A little fight in you.	I like that.

BATMAN
Then you're going to love me.

The Joker turns. Batman catches him with a BLOW, spins him down and DISARMS him- the Joker's men jump him- Batman takes them out two at a time- DISARMING thugs- BREAKING forearms-the Joker CLICKS a BLADE from the toe of his shoe and KICKS-JABBING BETWEEN THE PLATES OF ARMOR covering Batman's ribcage-

Batman HURLS the Joker across the room. One of the Joker's men LUNGES- Batman lays him out cold.

The Joker has another knife pressed to Rachel's neck.

BATMAN
Drop the knife.

THE JOKER
Sure. Just take off your mask and show us all who you are...

Rachel shakes her head at Batman. The Joker raises his shotgun to the side and BLOWS OUT the pane of glass next to him. The Joker dangles Rachel out the window.

BATMAN
Let her go.
 
55.


THE JOKER
(laughs)

Very poor choice of words...

He lets her DROP- Rachel falls onto a SLOPING GLASS ROOF-sliding towards the edge Batman DIVES after her-

EXT. BUILDING -- NIGHT

They DROP- Batman FIRES his grapple, SNAGGING Rachel's ankle-activates one wing of his cape- They SPIN and SLOW- Batman envelopes Rachel- they SLAM into the hood of a passing taxi.

INT. TAXI -- CONTINUOUS

The DRIVER SCREAMS as Batman and Rachel hit the roof- ROLL down the windshield- onto the pavement. Alive.

INT. CAR -- CONTINUOUS

The Joker looks back as his car SPEEDS away. He's breathing hard, EXHILARATED. He touches the blood running down his sweaty white makeup. SMACKS the back of the driver's seat-

DRIVER
What do we do about Dent?

THE JOKER
I'm a man of my word.

EXT. TAXI -- CONTINUOUS

Rachel opens her eyes.

BATMAN
Are you alright?

RACHEL
Let's not do that again, okay?
(looks around)

Is Harvey-?

BATMAN
He's safe.

Rachel lies back, breathing.	Looks up at Batman.

RACHEL
Thank you.

INT. MAJOR CRIMES UNIT, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- DAY

STEPHENS is talking to Gordon, subdued.

STEPHENS
Jim, it's over.
 
56.


GORDON
As long as they don't get to Lau,

we've cut off their funds.

STEPHENS
But the prosecution's over.

STEPHENS
No-one's standing up in front of a
Judge while judges and police

commissioners are getting blown away.

GORDON
What about Dent?

STEPHENS
If he's got any sense, Dent's halfway to Mexico by now.

The door BURSTS OPEN.	Dent.	Fire in his eyes.

DENT
So where do you keep your trash?

Gordon looks at Dent.	Impressed.

INT. SPECIAL HOLDING AREA, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- DAY

Lau looks up as Dent walks in, holding a bullet proof vest.

DENT
You're due in court- I need you alive long enough to get you on the record.

LAU
No way. You can't protect me- you can't even protect yourselves.

Dent THROWS the heavy vest at Lau.

DENT
Refuse to cooperate on the stand- you won't be coming back here- you'll go to county. How long do you calculate you'll last in there?

INT. BAT-BUNKER -- DAY

Wayne sits at his video screens- they all play the Joker's video with different IMAGE TREATMENTS and SOUND TUNINGS. Wayne turns to Alfred. Indicates the screens.

WAYNE
Targeting me won't get their money back. I knew the mob wouldn't go down without a fight, but this is different. They've crossed a line.
