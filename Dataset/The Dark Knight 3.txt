ALFRED
You crossed it first, sir. You've hammered them, squeezed them to the point of desperation. And now, in their desperation they've turned to a man they don't fully understand.

Wayne gets up from his monitors, raises the bat-cabinet.

WAYNE
Criminals aren't complicated, Alfred. We just have to figure out what he's after.

ALFRED
Respectfully, Master Wayne, perhaps this is a man you don't fully understand, either.

ALFRED
(looks at Wayne)

I was in Burma. A long time ago. My friends and I were working for the local government. They were trying to buy the loyalty of tribal leaders, bribing them with precious stones. But their caravans were being raided in a forest north of Rangoon by a bandit. We were asked to take care of the problem, so we started looking for the stones. But after six months, we couldn't find anyone who had traded with him.

WAYNE
What were you missing?

ALFRED
One day I found a child playing with a ruby as big as a tangerine.
(shrugs)
The bandit had been throwing the
stones away.

WAYNE
So why was he stealing them?

ALFRED
Because he thought it was good sport. Because some men aren't looking for anything logical, like money... they can't be bought, bullied, reasoned or negotiated with.
(grave)
Some men just want to watch the world burn.

Wayne stares at Alfred.	Reaches for the bat-suit.
 
58.


EXT. SKYLINE OF GOTHAM -- DAWN

MOVING over the city we hear myriad RADIO CALLS going out over the ether. CLOSE IN on a lonely figure on top of a skyscraper. The Batman. Listening with his million dollar earpieces. From the babble, ONE VOICE EMERGES.

DISPATCH (O.S.)
Your name, sir.	Please state-

VOICE (O.S.)
8th at orchard. You'll find Harvey Dent there.

EXT. 8TH STREET AT ORCHARD -- DAWN

An UNMARKED and a SQUAD CAR screech to a halt. Gordon and Ramirez get out, lead two UNIFORMS into the building.

INT. APARTMENT, EIGHT AVE. -- CONTINUOUS

The door SMASHES OPEN, Gordon- gun drawn- takes in the scene. TWO DEAD MEN sitting at the kitchen table. They each have a HAND OF CARDS, as if in the middle of a game. ALL JOKERS.

Gordon and Ramirez STARE at the CRUDE LEERS carved into their faces. Their DRIVERS LICENSES are pinned to their chests.

VOICE
Check the names.

GORDON
(checks licenses)

Patrick Harvey.	Richard Dent...

RAMIREZ
Harvey Dent.

BATMAN
I need ten minutes with the scene

before your men contaminate it.

RAMIREZ
Us contaminate it? It's because of you that these guys are dead in the first place-

GORDON
Ramirez.

She stands down. Batman moves past the bodies to the wall. Finds an embedded stray bullet. He pulls a SAWING DEVICE from his belt- THRUSTS it into the wall and starts cutting around the bullet.

GORDON
That's brick- you're gonna try and take ballistics off a shattered bullet?
 
59.


BATMAN
No.	Fingerprints.

Ramirez looks at Gordon.	Is he serious?	Gordon points-

GORDON
Whatever you're gonna do, do it fast, 'cos we know his next target...

Batman looks- a campaign poster: RE-ELECT MAYOR GARCIA. The Mayor's image has a MANIC CLOWN'S GRIN and "HA,HA,HA".

INT. FOX'S OFFICE, WAYNE ENTERPRISES -- DAY

Fox is at his desk.	Reese enters.

FOX
What can I do for you, Mr. Reese?

REESE
You asked me to do the diligence on the L.S.I.Holdings deal again. I found irregularities.

FOX
Their CEO is in police custody.

REESE
Not with their numbers. With yours. A whole division of Wayne Industries disappeared, overnight. So I went down to the archives and started pulling old files.

He pulls out a folded blueprint.	Slides it across the desk.

REESE
My kids love the Batman. I thought he was pretty cool, too. Out there, kicking some ass.

Fox picks up the piece of paper. Unfolds it. It's an old BLUEPRINT. The image is unmistakable: THE TUMBLER.

REESE
Changes things when you know it's

just a rich kid playing dress up.

Reese points to the approval box in the corner of the page.

REESE
Your project. Don't tell me you didn't recognize your baby pancaking cop cars on the evening news. Now you're getting sloppy. Applied Sciences was a small, dead department-who'd notice?
(MORE)
 
60.
REESE (cont'd)
But now you've got the entire R and D department burning cash, claiming it's related to cell phones for the army. What are you building him now? A rocket ship? I want ten million a year. For the rest of my life.

Fox looks at him.	Even.	Folds up the blueprint.

FOX
Let me get this straight. You think that your client, one of the wealthiest and most powerful men in the world, is secretly a vigilante who spends his nights beating criminals to a pulp with his bare hands...
(deadpan)
And now your plan is to blackmail

this person?

Reese stares at Fox. Who smiles. And slides the blueprint across the desk.

FOX
Good luck.

Reese looks at it.	Then at Fox.	Swallows.	Slides it back.

INT. BAT-BUNKER -- DAY

Wayne hands Alfred a RIFLE BULLET scribed with a GRID. He slots it into a clip, then loads it into a COMPUTER CONTROLLED GATTLING GUN. He puts on ear protectors. Hits a button.

The rifle WHIRS to life- dollying sideways, BLASTING BULLETS into a series of identical BRICK WALL SAMPLES.

ALFRED
I'm not sure you made it loud enough, sir.

As the wall samples still smoke, Wayne steps up, carrying the sample from the crime scene. Comparing its spread to the new samples, he selects two and carries them to an X-RAY SCANNER.

The machine gives the samples a 3-axis scan- HI-RES 3-D IMAGES of the bullet fragment arrays come up on the screen...

INT. APPLIED SCIENCES DIVISION -- DAY

The same image of the bullet fragment on a screen. Fox hits a key and the computer 'reassembles' the bullets according to the identifying grid on each fragment.

FOX
Here's your original scan...
 
61.


A bullet fragment array pops on screen.

FOX
Here's it reverse-engineered...

Fox hits a button and the unmarked bullet fragments are reassembled. Wayne spins the roughly-shaped bullet puzzle-

WAYNE
And here's a thumb print.

Fox looks at the screen, impressed.	Thinks.

FOX
I'll make you a copy.
(troubled)

Mr.Wayne, did you reassign R and D?

WAYNE
Yes. Government telecommunications project.

FOX
I wasn't aware we had any new

government contracts.	Can you-

WAYNE
Lucius. I'm playing this one pretty close to the chest.

FOX
Fair enough.

Fox looks at Wayne as he leaves.	Uneasy.

INT. BAT-BUNKER -- CONTINUOUS -- INTERCUT

Wayne examines the fingerprint-

WAYNE
I've run it through all the databases and came up with four possibles.

Wayne gets up to let Alfred sit.

WAYNE (CONT’D)
Cross-reference the addresses.

Look for Parkside and around.

Wayne opens a HYDRAULIC DOOR, revealing a gleaming MV AUGUSTA BRUTALE. As he moves the bike onto the lift...

ALFRED
Got one. Melvin White, aggravated assault, moved to Arkham twice- 1502 Randolph Apartments, just off State-
 
62.


WAYNE
Overlooking the parade.

Wayne and the bike rise on the lift.

EXT. PARKSIDE AVENUE -- DAY

The avenue has been blocked off. Onlookers line the sidewalks. POLICE march past in dress uniform. Engel does a stand-up on the sidewalk.

ENGEL
With no word from the Batman- even as they mourn Commissioner Loeb, these cops have to be wondering if the Joker is going to make good on his threat to kill the Mayor today...

On the buildings above, POLICE SNIPERS scan the crowd. Gordon keys his radio-

GORDON
How's it looking up top?

POLICE SNIPER
We're tight. But frankly... there's a lot of windows up here.

Gordon looks up at the myriad buildings overlooking the podium.

EXT. GOTHAM STREETS -- CONTINUOUS

Wayne maneuvers the Ducati through the traffic. He pulls up near a parade barricade- dismounts and slips into an alley.

INT. TENEMENT -- CONTINUOUS

Some of the building's hard-luck TENANTS eye Wayne as he
counts doors down the hallway.	He finds 1502...

EXT. PARKSIDE AVENUE -- LATER

A SEA OF POLICE fills the Avenue. In the center, three grieving families and an HONOR GUARD. The Mayor at the podium. Gordon behind. Dent is seated with Rachel.

THE MAYOR
...and as we recognize the sacrifice of these officers, we must remember that vigilance is the price of safety.

INT. TENEMENT -- CONTINUOUS

Wayne enters: EIGHT MEN IN UNDERSHIRTS, bound, gagged, blindfolded. A SNIPER SCOPE on a tripod at the window. Wayne moves to the first man, RIPS the tape from his mouth.
 
63.


MAN
(breathing hard)
Took... they took our guns, our

uniforms...

EXT. PARKSIDE AVENUE -- CONTINUOUS

Gordon scans the crowd.	The Mayor wraps up- the Honor Guard
steps forward, raises weapons...

EXT. ROOFTOP OVERLOOKING PARKSIDE -- CONTINUOUS

A POLICE SNIPER scans the windows of the tenement...

INT. TENEMENT -- CONTINUOUS

Wayne RACES to the window, looks through the SCOPE to see:

EXT. STATE STREET -- CONTINUOUS

THE HONOR GUARD TURN THEIR WEAPONS ON THE MAYOR. One SMILES, flesh-colored makeup over his scars. THE JOKER.

Gordon LEAPS FORWARD- they FIRE- GORDON TAKES SHOTS TO THE BACK as he SLAMS the Mayor to the ground-

EXT. ROOFTOP OVERLOOKING PARKSIDE -- CONTINUOUS

The Police Sniper SPOTS Wayne at the window- SHOOTS-

INT. TENEMENT -- CONTINUOUS

Wayne DUCKS as SHOTS erupt around the window-

EXT. PARKSIDE -- CONTINUOUS

PANDEMONIUM erupts-One of the honor guard is TAGGED IN THE LEG- GOES DOWN. The others MELT into the CHAOS.

On the podium, Stephens rolls Gordon over... he is not moving.

EXT. SIDE STREET OFF PARKSIDE -- MOMENTS LATER

CHAOS. Dent approaches an ambulance sitting in the alley. Two cops jump out and run over to their commander. Dent steps up into the back.

INT. AMBULANCE -- CONTINUOUS

The Joker's thug sits there. Handcuffed. A PARAMEDIC bandages his leg. Cops run past, barking orders.

DENT
Tell me what you know about the

Joker.
 
64.


The Joker's thug looks at Dent. Smirks. Dent looks down. Exasperated. Looks back up at the Joker's Thug. Spots something- moves closer- the man's uniform... his name tag...

OFFICER RACHEL DAWES.

Dent, breathing hard, looks around: the paramedic jumps out, rushing to help a FALLEN OFFICER. Dent spies the keys in the ignition. Jumps into the driver's seat...

EXT. GORDON'S HOUSE -- DUSK

Barbara Gordon stands in the doorway, scared. Stephens and a UNIFORMED OFFICER stand in front of her.

STEPHENS
I'm sorry, Barbara.

James Gordon pushes past his mother to look at Stephens.
Barbara tries to push him back inside.

BARBARA
Jimmy, go play with your sister...

James stays just inside the door.

STEPHENS
I'm sorry.

Barbara stares at Stephens.	Then looks past him.

BARBARA
Are you out there?!	Are you?!

James spots something- Batman, perched in the shadows.

BARBARA
You brought this on us!	This
craziness!	You did!	You brought
this...!

She collapses into Stephens's arms.	Batman hangs his head.

EXT. ROOF, MCU -- NIGHT

Detectives from MCU stand around the lit bat-signal.

STEPHENS
Switch it off- he ain't coming.

He doesn't want to talk to us. God help whoever he does want to talk to-

INT. NIGHTCLUB -- NIGHT

Strobe lights. Pounding music. Maroni is in a booth at the side with his MISTRESS. His bodyguards are around the table.
 
65.


MISTRESS
(shouting over music)

Can't we go someplace quieter! We can't hear each other talk!

MARONI
I don't wanna hear you talk.

MISTRESS
(can't hear)

What?!

One of Maroni's Bodyguards DROPS- Maroni looks over- in the strobe lights- Batman SAVAGES his bodyguards- people RUN, TERRIFIED. Maroni starts to get out of his seat- Batman LANDS like a panther on the table in front of him-

INT. MCU -- NIGHT

Rachel moves through the chaotic bullpen at MCU-
EYEWITNESSES, civilian and cop are being questioned.

Rachel's phone rings.

RACHEL
Harvey, where are you?!

INTERCUT with Dent in an INDISTINCT interior setting.

DENT
Where are you?

RACHEL
Where you should be- at Major Crimes trying to sort through all the-

DENT
Rachel, listen to me.	You're not
safe there.

RACHEL
This is Gordon's unit, Harvey-

DENT
Gordon's gone, Rachel.

RACHEL
He vouched for these men-

DENT
And he's gone. The Joker's named you next.

Rachel looks around the bullpen.	Eyeing the detectives.

DENT
Rachel, I can't let anything happen to you. I love you too much.
(MORE)
 
66.
DENT (cont'd)
Is there someone, anyone in this city we can trust?

RACHEL
Bruce.	We can trust Bruce Wayne.

DENT
Rachel, I know he's your friend but-

RACHEL
Trust me, Harvey, Bruce's penthouse is now the safest place in the city.

DENT
Okay. Go straight there. Don't tell anyone where you're going. I'll find you there.

Wider shows us we are-

INT. BASEMENT, CONDEMNED BUILDING -- CONTINUOUS

DENT
I love you.

Dent hangs up the phone. TAPED to a chair in front of Dent-the Joker's Thug, blindfolded. Dent RIPS off the blindfold...

EXT. FIRE ESCAPE -- NIGHT

Maroni opens his eyes.	Batman is holding him by the collar.

BATMAN
I want the Joker.

MARONI
(looks down)

From one professional to another-if you're trying to scare someone, pick a better spot. From this height the fall wouldn't kill me.

BATMAN
I'm counting on it.

Batman lets go.	Maroni FALLS.	And SCREAMS.

EXT. SIDEWALK -- NIGHT

Maroni NAILS the pavement. CLUTCHES at his leg, which is badly broken. Batman FLIES down, landing over him- hauls him up. Maroni HOLLERS in pain.

BATMAN
Where is he?

MARONI
I don't know, he found us-
 
67.


BATMAN
He must have friends.

MARONI
Friends?	You met this guy?

BATMAN
Someone knows where he is.

Maroni looks up at Batman.	Sneering.

MARONI
No one's gonna tell you anything-they're wise to your act- you got rules... the Joker, he's got no rules. No one's gonna cross him for you. You want this guy, you got one way. And you already know what that is. Just take off that mask and let him come find you.

Batman DROPS Maroni.

MARONI
Or you want to let a couple more people get killed while you make up your mind?

INT. BASEMENT, CONDEMNED BUILDING -- NIGHT

Dent shows the Joker's Thug a GUN. Bullets. Loads the gun. SHOVES it in his face-

DENT
You wanna play games?

Dent PUSHES the gun against the thug's head with REAL MALICE. Pulls it away and FIRES. The Thug FLINCHES. Dent puts the gun barrel against the thug's temple-

JOKER'S THUG
(rattled)

You wouldn't...

And pulls his lucky coin out of his pocket.

DENT
No. I wouldn't. That's why I'm not going to leave it up to me.
(shows him coin)
Heads- you get to keep your head.
Tails... not so lucky.	So, you want
to tell me about the Joker?

The Thug, scared, says nothing. Dent FLICKS the coin into the air. SLAPS it onto the back of his gun hand (aiming with wrist horizontal). Dent shows him the coin. Heads. The Thug exhales, SHAKING.
 
68.


DENT
Go again?

JOKER'S THUG
(sobbing)

I don't know anything!

DENT
You're not playing the odds, friend.

Dent tosses the coin again. This time IT DOESN'T LAND. Dent looks up. Batman is there.

BATMAN
You'd leave a man's life to chance?

DENT
Not exactly.

BATMAN
His name's Schiff, Thomas. He's a paranoid schizophrenic, a former patient at Arkham. The kind of mind the Joker attracts.

Batman moves away from Schiff.

BATMAN
What do expect to learn from him?

Dent is shivering with frustration.

DENT
The Joker killed Gordon- and, and Loeb. He's going to kill Rachel...

BATMAN
You're the symbol of hope that I could never be. Your stand against organized crime is the first legitimate ray of light in Gotham for decades. If anyone saw this, everything would be undone- all the criminals you got off the streets would be released. And Jim Gordon will have died for nothing.

Batman hands Dent his lucky coin.

BATMAN
You're going to call a press

conference.	Tomorrow morning.

DENT
Why?
 
69.


BATMAN
No one else will die because of me.

Gotham is in your hands, now.

DENT
You can't!	You can't give in!

But Batman is gone.

INT. BEDROOM, WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- NIGHT

Rachel watches Gotham through the window.	Wayne enters.

RACHEL
Harvey called.	He says Batman is
going to turn himself in.

WAYNE
I have no choice.

RACHEL
You honestly think it's going to stop the Joker from killing?

WAYNE
Perhaps not. But I've got enough blood on my hands. I've seen, now, what I would have to become to stop men like him.

Rachel looks at Wayne.	She cannot help him.

WAYNE
You once told me that if the day came when I was finished...

Wayne moves towards her.

WAYNE
We'd be together.

RACHEL
Bruce, don't make me your one hope for a normal life-

Wayne takes her in his arms.

WAYNE
But did you mean it?

RACHEL
Yes.

They kiss.	Then separate.	She looks sadly into his eyes.

RACHEL
But they won't let us be together

after you turn yourself in.
 
70.


Wayne nods.	Leaves.	She watches him go.

INT. BAT-BUNKER -- DAWN

Alfred shovels DOCUMENTS into an incinerator- blueprints, designs, files. He pauses, looking down at a book.

ALFRED
Even the logs?

WAYNE
Anything that could lead back to

Lucius or Rachel.

Alfred tosses the book onto the fire.	STARES at Wayne.

WAYNE
People are dying, Alfred. What would you have me do?

Alfred looks into Wayne's eyes with a fearsome gaze.

ALFRED
Endure, Master Wayne. Take it. They'll hate you for it, but that's the point of Batman... he can be the outcast. He can make the choice no one else can face. The right choice.

Wayne shakes his head.

WAYNE
Today I've found out what Batman
can't do.	He can't endure this.
(rueful smile)
Today you get to say 'I told you so'.

ALFRED
Today, I don't want to.
(beat)

Although I did bloody tell you.

Wayne sinks the Bat-suit, Alfred closes the incinerator.
They head for the lift.

ALFRED
I suppose they'll lock me up as well.

Your accomplice.

WAYNE
Accomplice? I'm going to tell them the whole thing was your idea.

They power down, leaving the Bat-bunker in darkness.
 
71.


INT. PRESS ROOM, SUPERIOR COURT -- DAY

A capacity crowd of REPORTERS, COPS, and PUBLIC. Dent is at the podium. Wayne sits in the crowd.

DENT
Ladies and Gentlemen, thank you for coming. I've called this press conference for two reasons. Firstly, to assure the citizens of Gotham that everything that can be done over the Joker killing is being done. Secondly, because the Batman has offered to turn himself in-

The crowd REACTS-

HECKLER
So where is he?!

DENT
But first. Let's consider the situation: should we give in to this terrorist's demands? Do we really think that-

REPORTER
You'd rather protect an outlaw
vigilante than the lives of

citizens?!

The crowd noisily assents.	Dent calmly motions quiet.

DENT
The Batman is an outlaw...

INT. WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

Rachel is watching the press conference on TV.

DENT (O.S.)
But that's not why we're demanding he turn himself in. We're doing it because we're scared. We've been happy to let Batman clean up our streets for us until now-

INT. PRESS ROOM, SUPERIOR COURT -- CONTINUOUS

HECKLER
Things are worse than ever!

Wayne looks at the Heckler. At the angry crowd. Dent leans over the podium. Impassioned.

DENT
Yes.	They are.	But the night is
darkest just before the dawn.
(MORE)
 
72.
DENT (cont'd)
And I promise you, the dawn is
coming.
(the crowd quiets)
One day, the Batman will have to answer for the laws he's broken- but to us, not to this madman.

The crowd seems moved by his words, then, a CHANT-

COP HECKLER
NO MORE DEAD COPS!!

Appreciative noise.

REPORTER
WHERE IS THE BATMAN?

People take up the chant.	Dent has lost them.	He knows it.

DENT
So be it.
(turns to officers)

Take the Batman into custody.

At this, a HUSH DESCENDS. Wayne is sitting towards the back. Hungry eyes scan the room. Wayne starts to rise... DENT OFFERS HIS OWN WRISTS TO THE OFFICERS-

DENT
I am the Batman.

A beat.	Wayne stares.

INT. WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

Rachel STARES as Dent is arrested on TV.	Appalled.

INT. WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- DAY

Rachel comes up to Alfred.	Upset.

RACHEL
Why is he letting Harvey do this,

Alfred?

ALFRED
I don't know. He went down to the press conference-

RACHEL
And just stood by?!

ALFRED
Perhaps both Bruce and Mr.Dent believe that Batman stands for something more important than a terrorist's whims, Miss Dawes, even if everyone hates him for it.

(MORE)
 
73.
ALFRED (cont'd)
That's the sacrifice he's making- to not be a hero. To be something more.

RACHEL
Well, you're right about one thing-letting Harvey take the fall is not heroic.

Rachel holds out an ENVELOPE.

RACHEL
You know Bruce best, Alfred... give it to him when the time is right.

ALFRED
How will I know?

RACHEL
It's not sealed.

Alfred takes the envelope.	Rachel gives him a kiss.

RACHEL
Goodbye, Alfred.

ALFRED
Goodbye, Rachel.

INT. CELL, MCU -- EVENING

A Detective unlocks the cell and lets Rachel inside.

DENT
I'm sorry, I didn't have time to talk this through with you.

RACHEL
Don't offer yourself as bait, Harvey.

DENT
They're transferring me to central holding. This is the Joker's chance, and when he attacks, Batman will take him down.

RACHEL
No.	This is too dangerous-

The Detective knocks.	Dent rises.

EXT. COURTYARD MCU -- EVENING

Detectives stare at Dent as he is led, shackled, to the waiting CONVOY. Stephens begins CLAPPING- a handful join in, but most remain silent. Rachel follows him to the back of an armored vehicle.
 
74.


RACHEL
He's using you as bait- but he doesn't know if he can get the Joker-he's failed so far.

DENT
How do you know what he's thinking?

RACHEL
(beat)

I just do, okay? Harvey, this isn't just about you, what about all the people counting on you to turn this city around? Tell everyone the truth-

Dent kisses her.	Pulls out his LUCKY COIN-

DENT
Heads I go through with it.

RACHEL
This is your life... you don't leave something like this to chance...

Dent tosses it at her- Rachel catches it.	Looks.	Heads.

DENT
(sincere)

I'm not.

She turns it over: IT IS DOUBLE-HEADED. She looks up- the DOORS CLOSE on his smile. She shakes her head. Torn.

RACHEL
You make your own luck.

As SWATS file into the back of the support vehicles-

ACTING COMISSIONER
We get this guy to County and he's their problem. The streets along your route will be cleared. The convoy stops FOR NO REASON...

SHOTGUN SWAT
We've got company back here-

EXT. LOWER FIFTH AVENUE -- NIGHT

A SECOND TRUCK SMASHES into the SWAT van at the head of the convoy, SMASHING it through the concrete barriers and INTO THE RIVER. The truck is branded "LAUGHTER" but and "S" has been spayed at the front to make "SLAUGHTER" with "HA, HA, HA" all over the side...

The Joker's Truck DODGES between the support columns and into the oncoming lane- pulls alongside the armored car.

The Driver looks over. The cargo door on the truck slides open. Inside, the Joker, holding a machine gun.

The armored car LOCKS up its brakes, but the garbage truck pushes it forward as the Joker fires- BULLETS slamming into the side of the vehicle-

EXT. LOWER LEVEL STREET -- CONTINUOUS

The crowd JUMPS- PANELS of the front of the car BLOW OUT-

The crowd stares, OPEN-MOUTHED, as Batman EMERGES, HOISTED UP AND OUT of the flaming car by the FRONT POD- LEVERING OVER the FRONT WHEEL... the pod PUSHES the OTHER WHEEL IN FRONT to form a type of MOTORCYCLE-

The BAT-POD SHOOTS FORWARD, bursting free as the Batmobile DETONATES, DYING in a MASSIVE FIREBALL... Batman's cape SUCKS TOGETHER, forming a TIGHT PACK on his shoulders, clear of the CHURNING REAR TIRE of the bat-pod...

EXT. LOWER LEVEL STREET -- NIGHT

Batman accelerates, oblivious to the STACCATO of CLEAVED wing mirrors as the bat-pod RAZORS through traffic- CROSSES a BUSY INTERSECTION- The bat-pod CUTS off the crowded lower level street, ROARING over into the PARKING LANES-

Batman squeezes his triggers- BLASTING at PARKED CARS, BLOWING them out of the way, literally CANNONING A PATH for the pod...

The Bat-Pod CANNONS through the glass doors and RACES through the station/mall- COMMUTERS screaming and diving out of the way-

THUG

The Joker looks ahead to see the Bat-pod emerge from the alley in a cloud of fire, SKIDDING SIDEWAYS IMPOSSIBLY- it RACES TOWARDS THEM-

THE JOKER
Guess it was him.

The cable goes TAUT, RIPPING one post from its foundation-
the TRUCK'S FRONT WHEELS CATCH, FLIPPING IT END OVER END...

The Joker crawls from the wreckage. He jumps over the median and starts waving his pistol at oncoming traffic. Batman GUNS the bat-pod and rides it up and over the median.

INT. ARMORED CAR -- NIGHT

The Driver slows the car, pulls to the side.

SHOTGUN SWAT
What the hell are you doing?

EXT. PARKSIDE -- NIGHT

The Joker walks towards the Bat-pod, which SPEEDS towards him. He is FIRING his gun RANDOMLY at the oncoming traffic.

THE JOKER
Hit me.	Come on.	Hit me.

Batman watches as the Joker holds out his arms. Waiting for impact. There is no room to go around him.

Batman LOCKS UP THE BRAKES.

The Joker watches as Batman DUMPS the bike, rather than smashing into him. Batman SLAMS into the wall.

The Joker's thug reach Batman first. He is unconscious. The first Thug pulls at the mask. An ELECTRIC SHOCK from the bat-suit THROWS him back. The Joker LAUGHS. Flicks his switchblade. Crouches-

VOICE
Drop it.

THE JOKER
Just give me a second.

The gun is COCKED. The Joker drops the knife. Sits. Looks back. Behind them is the armored car. The man standing over him is the Driver. He pulls off his helmet.

It's JIM GORDON.	Back from the dead.

GORDON
We got you, you son of a bitch.
 
82.


INT. ARMORED CAR -- MOMENTS LATER

Dent looks up as the door swings open to reveal Gordon.	Dent
GRINS.

DENT
Lieutenant, you do like to play it pretty close to the chest...

GORDON
We got him, Harvey.

Dent nods.	Respect in his eyes.	They shake hands.

EXT. PARKSIDE -- NIGHT

A small army of cops have sealed off the roadway. Gordon pulls away in the squad car containing the Joker.

REPORTERS clamor for an interview with Dent, who is being helped out of the van by the SWATS. Ramirez pushes through the pack, shoving reporters aside.

RAMIREZ
Let him be!	He's been through enough-

Dent follows Ramirez to a squad car- Wuertz is in the driver's seat. Dent smiles at Ramirez as she opens the rear door.

DENT
Thanks, detective- I've got a date with a pretty upset fiancée.

RAMIREZ
I figured, counselor.

Ramirez shuts the door on Dent. Signals Wuertz to pull out. INT. HOLDING, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT

The Joker sits in a holding cage. His makeup has run, his clothes a mess- but his calm lends him an odd dignity. COPS SMASH their night sticks against the bars near the Joker's head. The Joker does not flinch.

GORDON
Stand away! All of you. I don't want anything for his mob lawyer to use, understand? Handle this guy like he's made of glass.

The Mayor walks in.	Shakes Gordon's hand.

MAYOR
Back from the dead.
 
83.


GORDON
I couldn't chance my family's safety.

The Mayor looks over at the Joker in his cage.

MAYOR
What do we got?

GORDON
Nothing. No matches on prints, DNA, dental. Clothing is custom, no labels. Nothing in his pockets but knives and lint. No name, no other alias... nothing.

MAYOR
Go home, Gordon. The clown'll keep till morning. Get some rest- you're going to need it. Tomorrow, you take the big job.
(off look)
You don't have any say in the matter. (louder, for all)

Commissioner Gordon.

The cops in M.C.U. start CHEERING.

EXT. GORDON HOME -- NIGHT

Gordon rings the bell.	Barbara answers it, dressed in black.

GORDON
I couldn't tell you.	I couldn't risk-

She SLAPS Gordon.	He grabs her, holds her tight as she sobs.

INT. HOLDING, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT

The Joker's men are processed. In the harsh light, the men look a little ridiculous in their clown make-up. DETECTIVE MURPHY turns to Stephens.

DETECTIVE MURPHY
Look at these ugly bastards.

One of the men, walks over, clutching at his belly.

FAT THUG
I don't feel good.

DETECTIVE MURPHY
You're a cop killer. You're lucky to be feeling anything below the neck.

Alone in his cage, the Joker smiles at this.

James Jr's cheek.	James's eyes open.

Did Batman save you, dad?
 


He reaches out to touch Staring at his dad as

GORDON
Actually, this time I saved him.

Gordon's phone rings-

The Joker, in near darkness.	Gordon walks in.	Sits.

THE JOKER
Evening, Commissioner.

GORDON
Harvey Dent never made it home.

THE JOKER
Of course not.

GORDON
What have you done with him?

THE JOKER
(laughs)

Me? I was right here. Who did you leave him with? Your people? Assuming, of course, that they are your people not Maroni's...
(off look)
Does it depress you, Lieutenant, to know how alone you are?

Gordon can't help glancing at the mounted CAMERA.
