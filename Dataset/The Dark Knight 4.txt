THE JOKER
Does it make you feel responsible for

Harvey Dent's current predicament?

GORDON
Where is he?

THE JOKER
What time is it?

GORDON
What difference does that make?

THE JOKER
Depending on the time, he might be in one spot.
(smiles)

Or several.

Gordon stands.	Moves to the Joker.	Undoes his handcuffs.

GORDON
If we're going to play games, I'm

going to need a cup of coffee.

THE JOKER
The good cop, bad cop routine?

Gordon pauses, hand on the doorknob.

GORDON
Not exactly.

Gordon steps out. The overhead lights COME ON. BATMAN IS BEHIND HIM. The Joker BLINKS in the HARSH WHITE LIGHT.

WHAM! The Joker's face HITS the table- comes up for air-CRACK! CRACK! To the head. Batman is in front of him. The Joker stares, fascinated. Bleeding.

THE JOKER
Never start with the head... victim gets fuzzy. Can't feel the next-

CRACK!	Batman's fist SMACKS down on the Joker's fingers.

THE JOKER
(calm)

See?

BATMAN
You wanted me.	Here I am.

THE JOKER
I wanted to see what you'd do. And you didn't disappoint...
(laughs)
You let five people die.

(MORE)
 
86.

THE JOKER (cont'd)
Then you let Dent take your place. Even to a guy like me... that's cold-

BATMAN
Where's Dent?

THE JOKER
Those mob fools want you gone so they can get back to the way things were. But I know the truth- there's no going back. You've changed things. Forever.

BATMAN
Then why do you want to kill me?

The Joker starts LAUGHING. After a moment he's laughing so hard it sounds like SOBBING.

THE JOKER
Kill you? I don't want to kill you. What would I do without you? Go back to ripping off Mob dealers? No you...
(points)
You.	Complete.	Me.

BATMAN
You're garbage who kills for money.

THE JOKER
Don't talk like one of them- you're not, even if you'd like to be. To them you're a freak like me... they just need you right now.

He regards Batman with something approaching pity.

THE JOKER
But as soon as they don't, they'll cast you out like a leper.

The Joker looks into Batman's eyes.	Searching.

THE JOKER
Their morals, their code... it's a bad joke. Dropped at the first sign of trouble. They're only as good as the world allows them to be. You'll see- I'll show you... when the chips are down, these civilized people... they'll eat each other.
(grins)

See, I'm not a monster... I'm just ahead of the curve.

Batman GRABS the Joker and pulls him upright.
 
87.


INT. OBSERVATION ROOM, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT

One of the Detectives moves for the door.	Gordon stops him.

GORDON
He's in control.

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT

Batman HOISTS the Joker up by the neck.

BATMAN
Where's Dent?

THE JOKER
You have these rules. And you think they'll save you.

BATMAN
I have one rule.

THE JOKER
Then that's the one you'll have to break. To know the truth.

BATMAN
Which is?

THE JOKER
(smiles)

The only sensible way to live in this world is without rules. Tonight you're going to break your one rule...

Batman leans in to the Joker.

BATMAN
I'm considering it.

THE JOKER
There are just minutes left- so, you'll have to play my little game if you want to save...
(with relish)
...one of them.

BATMAN
Them?

THE JOKER
For a while I thought you really were Dent, the way you threw yourself after her-

Batman DROPS the Joker- RIPS up a bolted-down chair-
 
88.


INT. OBSERVATION ROOM, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT

Gordon MOVES for the door-

INT. OBSERVATION ROOM, MCU -- CONTINUOUS

Batman JAMS the chair under the doorknob- PICKS up the Joker and HURLS him into the two-way glass. The glass SPIDERS.

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT

The Joker, bleeding from nose and mouth, LAUGHS at Batman.

THE JOKER
Look at you go... does Harvey know about you and his-?

The Joker SMASHES into the wall- SLIDES to the floor. Batman stands over him, a man possessed-

BATMAN
WHERE ARE THEY?!

He GRABS the Joker, holding him close-

THE JOKER
Killing is making a choice...

Batman PUNCHES the Joker across the face.	HARD.

BATMAN
WHERE ARE THEY?!

The Joker FEEDS off Batman's anger.	Loving it.

THE JOKER
...you choose one life over the other. Your friend, the district attorney. Or his blushing bride-to-be.

Batman PUNCHES the Joker again.	The Joker LAUGHS.

THE JOKER
You have nothing. Nothing to threaten me with. Nothing to do with all your strength...
(spits a tooth)
But don't worry, I'm going to tell you where they are. Both of them, and that's the point- you'll have to choose.

The Batman stares at the Joker...

THE JOKER
He's at 250 52nd Boulevard.	And
she's on avenue X at Cicero.
 
89.


Batman DROPS him.

INT. OBSERVATION ROOM, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT

Batman RACES past Gordon.

GORDON
Which one are you-

BATMAN
Dent knew the risks.

Gordon looks back- the Joker is bloody, but grinning.

EXT. MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT

Several cops see Batman climb onto the bat-pod and TEAR off.

EXT. STREETS, GOTHAM -- NIGHT

Batman SWERVES into oncoming traffic, CHAOS in his wake.

EXT. GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT

Gordon and his men SCRAMBLE into their cars...

INT. BASEMENT APARTMENT -- NIGHT

Black.

RACHEL
Can anyone hear me?

Harvey Dent opens his eyes. He's bound to a chair in a dingy, unfurnished basement apartment.

DENT
Rachel?	Rachel is that you?

RACHEL
(sobbing)

Harvey.	You're OK.	I thought...

Her voice is coming from a speakerphone on the floor.

DENT
It's OK, Rachel. Everything's going to be just fine.

He looks around. Behind him, metal BARRELS, hooked up to a car battery, with a TIMER counting down: five minutes.

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT

The Joker sits, smiling, content.	Stephens guards the door.

THE JOKER
I want my phone call.
 
90.


STEPHENS
That's nice.

THE JOKER
How many of your friends have I

killed?

STEPHENS
I'm a twenty year man. I can tell the difference between punks who need a little lesson in manners, and the freaks like you who would just enjoy it.
(quiet)
And you killed six of my friends.

INT. HOLDING AREA, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT

The Fat Thug shuffles to the bars, where a COP stands guard.

FAT THUG
(agony)

Please.	My insides hurt.

COP
Step away from the bars.

FAT THUG
The boss said he would make the voices go away. He said he would go inside and replace them with bright lights. Like Christmas.

COP
That's great.	Please step-

The Fat Thug COLLAPSES.	The Cop grabs his radio.

INT. WAREHOUSE -- NIGHT

Rachel is bound to a chair. Behind her are barrels identical to the ones behind Dent.

DENT
Can you move your chair?

RACHEL
No.	Harvey, we don't have much time-

The timer connected to the bomb reads 2.47... 2.46...

INT. BASEMENT APARTMENT -- NIGHT

Dent DRAGS his chair, inching closer to the barrels.

DENT
Look for something to free yourself.
 
91.


The chair JAMS against a ridge in the floor. Dent STRAINS to reach the timer. Inches shy.

RACHEL
They said only one of us was going to
make it.	That they'd let our...
(pause)

Our friends choose...

Dent strains... THE CHAIR, AND DENT, TOPPLE OVER- KNOCKING OVER A BARREL.

RACHEL
Harvey?	What's happening?

Dent, one side of his face pressed against the bare floor, watches the open barrel SPEW DIESEL FUEL around him-

DENT
Nothing.	I'm trying to...

Dent contorts his head to keep from swallowing any.

EXT. STREETS, GOTHAM -- NIGHT

The bat-pod SKIDS SIDEWAYS, WHEELS FLIPPING as the gyro keeps Batman upright on the tumbling bike- it comes to rest- guns lined up with a fire exit- BLOWS the door off its hinges-JUMPS off the bike-

EXT. 52ND STREET, GOTHAM -- NIGHT

Gridlock.	Gordon SWERVES onto the sidewalk.	People SCATTER.

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT

The Joker sits like a kid kept after class.	He smiles.

THE JOKER
You know why I use a knife, Detective? Guns are too quick. You don't get to savor all the little emotions. See, in their last moments, people show you who they really are...

Stephens tries hard to ignore him.	It isn't working.

THE JOKER
So, in a way, I knew your friends
better than you ever did.
(smiles)

Would you like to know which of them were really cowards?
 
92.


STEPHENS
(rolls up sleeves)
I know you're going to enjoy this.

But I'm going to enjoy it more.

Stephens PUNCHES the Joker in the gut.

INT. BASEMENT APARTMENT -- NIGHT

Dent is half submerged in diesel fuel.

RACHEL
Harvey, in case... I want you to know something...

Dent CHOKES, his emotions overwhelming him.

DENT
Don't think like that, Rachel.

They're coming for you.

RACHEL
I know, but I don't want them to...

INT. WAREHOUSE -- NIGHT

Rachel looks at the timer.	Ten seconds left.

RACHEL
I don't want to live without you. Because I do have an answer, and my answer is yes...

INT. HOLDING AREA, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT

A MEDIC CUTS away the Fat Thug's shirt- his belly has large INCISION, which has been closed with crude looking STITCHES-

MEDIC
He's got some kind of... contusion...

A RECTANGULAR SHAPE is visible under the skin above his navel.

INT. DETECTIVE'S ROOM, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT

Stephens shuffles out into the room, a piece of BROKEN GLASS held to his THROAT by the Joker. Cops draw their weapons.

STEPHENS
This is my own damn fault.	Just
shoot him.

DETECTIVE MURPHY
What do you want?

THE JOKER
I want my phone call.
 
93.


The Detectives look at each other. One of them pulls out his cell phone. TOSSES it to the Joker, who begins to dial.

INT. HOLDING AREA, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT

The Medic gingerly PRESSES the rectangle. It illuminates, a soft blue light visible through the skin.

COP
Is that a... phone?

INT. DETECTIVE'S ROOM, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT

The Joker presses SEND. At the end of the room, the door to the holding area EXPLODES-

Batman KICKS- the door gives- Batman SMASHES it open-

INT. BASEMENT APARTMENT -- NIGHT

...Batman BURSTS through the door- Dent looks up in horror-

DENT
NO! Not me... Why did you come for me?!

Batman STARES at Dent. The Joker lied. The counter hits 5 seconds. Batman DRAGS Dent out- Dent FIGHTS to stay-

DENT
RACHEL!

RACHEL
Harvey?	Harvey, it's okay...

DENT
RACHEL!!!

EXT. 52ND STREET, GOTHAM -- NIGHT

Gordon, axe in hand, RUNS towards the entrance-

INT. BASEMENT APARTMENT -- NIGHT

Batman wraps his cape around Dent and hurls them both through the door. Dent is SCREAMING-

Gordon picks himself up. The warehouse is an inferno. He heads for it anyway. Five of his men have to RESTRAIN HIM.

EXT. ALLEYWAY, GOTHAM -- NIGHT

A SECOND EXPLOSION- Batman COVERS Dent as the FIREBALL HITS them- IGNITING the diesel soaking Dent's left side- he starts BURNING. And stops screaming. Batman ROLLS Dent on the wet pavement... Dent SIZZLES. Silent.

INT. SPECIAL HOLDING AREA, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT

The Joker walks to the bars of another cell.	Grins.

THE JOKER
Hello there.

In his cell.	Terrified.	Lau.

EXT. AMBULANCE -- CONTINUOUS

Dent is wheeled into an ambulance, bandages held to his face. His one visible eye STARES BLANKLY, oblivious to the panic-

EXT. 52ND STREET -- CONTINUOUS

Gordon watches the fire. DEBRIS blows across the asphalt. Gordon picks up two pieces: SINGED JOKER CARDS. In place of the Joker's face is a PHOTO OF LAU. A POLICE SERGEANT approaches.

SERGEANT
Dent's alive, Jim. Just. But back at M.C.U.... the Joker's gone...

GORDON
With Lau?
(the Cop nods)

The Joker planned to be caught. He wanted me to lock him up in M.C.U..
 
95.


EXT. STREET, DOWNTOWN GOTHAM -- DAWN

A squad car BLAZES down the street.	The Joker sticks his
head out the window like a dog, feeling the wind...

INT. KITCHEN, WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- DAWN

Alfred sits at a table reading the letter from Rachel.

RACHEL (V.O.)
Dear Bruce, I need to explain...

EXT. 52ND STREET -- DAWN

Water. Smoldering blackness. The FIRE CREWS extinguish the last flames of the devastated building. A FIREMAN nudges his COLLEAGUE, pointing out something in the devastation...

RACHEL (V.O.)
...I need to be honest and clear.
I'm going to marry Harvey Dent...

INT. INTENSIVE CARE UNIT -- DAWN

Glimpses of Dent's damaged face as SURGEONS surround him.

RACHEL (V.O.)
I love him, I want to spend the rest of my life with him...

EXT. 52ND STREET -- DAWN

The Firemen watch a statue-like figure amidst the charred ruins. The Batman.

RACHEL (V.O.)
When I told you that if Gotham no
longer needed Batman we could be
together, I meant it...

INT. MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- DAY

Gordon surveys the wreckage of MCU.	The bodies.

RACHEL (V.O.)
But I'm not sure the day will come...

EXT. 52ND STREET -- DAWN

Batman bends to the ground on one knee, his black glove spread against the smoldering debris.

RACHEL (V.O.)
...when you no longer need Batman. I hope it does, and if it does I will be there...
 
96.


He spots something. DENT'S TWO-HEADED COIN. Blackened, SCARRED. Batman turns it over. The other side is PRISTINE.

RACHEL (V.O.)

...but as your friend. I'm sorry to let you down...

Dent, heavily bandaged, hooked up to various machines.
Batman stands at the foot of his bed.	Watching.

If you lose your faith in me, please keep your faith in people...

BATMAN
I'm sorry, Harvey.

Batman puts DENT'S DAMAGED COIN on the bedside table.

INT. KITCHEN, WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

RACHEL (V.O.)
Love, now and always, Rachel.

Alfred finishes the letter. Tears in his eyes, he folds it back into its envelope. Places it on the breakfast tray.

INT. WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- DAWN

Alfred moves through the silent space, stepping past the cowl and gauntlets lying on the cold marble. He approaches Wayne, half-undressed, slumped in a chair watching Gotham.

ALFRED
I prepared a little breakfast.

Nothing. Alfred sets down the tray. The envelope is propped against the silver teapot.

ALFRED
Very well.

WAYNE
Alfred?

ALFRED
Yes, Master Wayne?

Wayne turns, a desperate look in his eye.
 
97.


WAYNE
Did I bring this on us? On her? I thought I would inspire good, not madness-

ALFRED
You have inspired good. But you spat in the face of Gotham's criminals-didn't you think there might be casualties? Things were always going to have to get worse before they got better.

WAYNE
But Rachel, Alfred...

ALFRED
Rachel believed in what you stood

for.	What we stand for.

Wayne looks up at Alfred.	Alfred picks up the cowl.

ALFRED
Gotham needs you.

WAYNE
Gotham needs its hero. And I let the Joker blow him half to hell-

ALFRED
Which is why for now, they'll have to make do with you.

Alfred hands him the cowl.	Wayne looks at him.

WAYNE
She was going to wait for me. Dent doesn't know. He can never know...

Alfred glances at the envelope.	Takes it off the tray.

WAYNE
What's that?

ALFRED
It can wait.

Alfred puts the envelope in his pocket.

WAYNE
That bandit, in the forest in
Burma...	Did you catch him?
(Alfred nods)
How?

ALFRED
(uneasy)

We burned the forest down.
 
98.

A national guard helicopter ROARS over Gotham General.

Dent. Bandaged. Sedated. Coming up for air. Sees something on the table: his coin. He fumbles for it, marvelling at its shiny face. Remembering.

INSERT CUT: RACHEL CATCHES THE COIN.

Dent turns the coin over. The other side is devastated. He STARES at the scarred face. Starts ripping his bandages.

INT. WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- DAY

Alfred comes up to Wayne.	Points him to the TV.

ALFRED
You need to see this.

On screen: Engel, in his studio, addresses the camera.

ENGEL
...he's a credible source- an A and M lawyer for a prestigious consultancy. He says he's waited as long as he can for the Batman to do the right thing...

The shot cuts to REESE, nodding.

ENGEL
Now he's taking matters into his own hands. We'll be live at five with the true identity of the Batman, stay with us...

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

Gordon ENTERS.	Dent STARES to one side.	He looks normal.

GORDON
I'm sorry about Rachel.
(nothing)

The Doctor says you're in agonizing pain but you won't accept medication. That you're refusing skin grafts-

DENT
Remember the name you all had for me when I was at Internal Affairs? What was it, Gordon?

GORDON
Harvey, I can't-
 
99.


DENT
SAY IT!

Dent's anger makes Gordon flinch.	He looks away.	Ashamed.

GORDON
(small)

Two-face.	Harvey two-face.

Dent turns to face Gordon- the left side of Dent's face is DESTROYED- skin blackened and shriveled. Molars visible. The eye a ball and socket. Dent manages a small smile with the good side of his face.

DENT
Why should I hide who I am?

GORDON
I... I know you tried to warn me. I'm sorry. Wuertz picked you up- was he working for them?
(nothing)
Do you know who picked up Rachel?
(nothing)
Harvey, I need to know which of my men I can trust.

Dent looks at Gordon.	Cold.

DENT
Why would you listen to me now?

GORDON
I'm sorry, Harvey.

DENT
No.	No you're not.	Not yet.

Gordon takes a last look at Dent.	Then leaves.

INT. CORRIDOR, HOSPITAL -- CONTINUOUS

Gordon steps out.	Someone is there.	Maroni.	On crutches.
Gordon stares at him.	Cold.	Maroni shifts, awkward.

MARONI

MARONI
You want him, I can tell you where he'll be this afternoon.

INT. RUSTED HULK -- CONTINUOUS

They pass into a huge hold. In the middle: A BILLION DOLLARS. The pile is thirty feet high. Standing on top- the Joker. At his feet, bound, is Lau. The Chechen laughs.

CHECHEN
Like I say- not so crazy as you look.

The Joker jumps from the top, slides down the pile.

THE JOKER
I told you- I'm a man of my word.
(looks around)

Where's the Italian?

The Chechen shrugs.	Pulls out a cigar.	Lights it.

CHECHEN
More for us. What you do with all your money, Mr.Joker?

The Joker GRABS a can of GASOLINE from his thug.

THE JOKER
I'm a man of simple tastes. I like gunpowder. Dynamite...

He is SPLASHING gasoline onto the money.

THE JOKER
...gasoline...

The Chechen, FURIOUS, steps forwards. The Joker turns. JABS his gun in the Chechen's face. The Chechen's bodyguards REACT. The Joker's men DRAW on them.

THE JOKER
And you know what they have in

common?	They're cheap.

CHECHEN
You said you were a man of your word.

The Joker PLUCKS the cigar from the Chechen's lips.

THE JOKER
I am.

The Joker tosses the cigar at the pile.

THE JOKER
I'm only burning my half.
 
101.


The Chechen watches the money catch fire.

THE JOKER
All you care about is money. This city deserves a better class of criminal, and I'm going to give it to them. This is my town now. Tell your men they work for me.

The Joker crouches down to the Chechen's dogs.	They GROWL.

CHECHEN
They won't work for a freak.

The Joker takes out a knife.	Tosses it to his man.

THE JOKER
Cut him up and offer him to his little Princes. Let's show him just how loyal a hungry dog is.

The Joker's men GRAB the Chechen.

THE JOKER
It's not about money.	It's about
sending a message...

The Joker watches the towering FLAMES.	Lau screams.

THE JOKER
Everything.	Burns.

The Joker pulls out a phone...

INT. TELEVISION STUDIO -- DAY

Reese has a confident air.	Engel is taking calls.

CALLER 1 (O.S.)
I wanna how much they're gonna pay you to say who Batman really is.

REESE
That's simply not why I'm doing this.

ENGEL
Caller, you're on the air.

CALLER 2 (O.S.)
Harvey dent didn't want us to give in to this maniac- you think you know better than him?

ENGEL
Guy's got a point- Dent didn't want Batman to give himself up, is this the right thing to do?
 
102.


REESE
If we could talk to Dent now he might feel differently-

ENGEL
And we wish him a speedy recovery. God knows we need him, now. Let's take another call-

OLD LADY (O.S.)
Mr.Reese, what's more valuable: one
life, or a hundred?

REESE
I guess it would depend on the life.

OLD LADY (O.S.)
OK. Let's say it's your life. Is it worth more than the lives of several hundred others?

REESE
Of course not.

OLD LADY (O.S.)
I'm glad you feel that way. Because I've put a bomb in one of the city's hospitals. It's going off in sixty minutes unless someone kills you.

ENGEL
Who is this?

OLD	(O.S.)
Just a concerned citizen-
(drops pitch to the
JOKER'S VOICE)

-and regular guy...

INT. MAJOR CRIMES UNIT, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- CONTINUOUS

Gordon and his men are gearing up to take down the Joker. A Detective turns up the TV in the bullpen-

THE JOKER (O.S.)
I had a vision. Of a world without Batman. The mob ground out a little profit and the police tried to shut them down, one block at a time...

and it was so... boring. I've had a change of heart. I don't want Mr.Reese spoiling everything, but why should I have all the fun? Let's give someone else a chance...

Reese looks around, twitching.	Sweating.
 
103.


THE JOKER (O.S.)
If Coleman Reese isn't dead in sixty minutes, then I blow up a hospital. Of course, you could always kill yourself, Mr.Reese. But that would be the noble thing to do. And you're a lawyer.

The line rings off.	Engel is speechless.

Gordon turns to the uniform COPS.

GORDON
Call in every officer- tell them to head to their nearest hospital and start evac and search. Call the transit authority, school board, prisons- get every available bus down to a hospital- the priority is Gotham General- wheel everybody out of that place right now- my hunch is that's where the bomb is.

DETECTIVE MURPHY
Why?

GORDON
That's where Harvey Dent is.

The Uniforms SPRINT off.	Gordon turns to his Detectives.

UNIFORMED COP
Where are we going, sir?

On screen: Reese is a deer in the headlights.

GORDON
To get Reese.

INT. WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- DAY

Wayne and Alfred move to the elevator.

Much more subtle.

Wayne's Lamborghini TEARS through downtown.

CHAOS. PATIENTS and STAFF running around. COPS and TRAFFIC WARDENS try to manage the evacuation. The COPS stationed outside Dent's room, look around, unsure-

NURSE
Sir, are you going to help?!

Two Cops move to help wheel gurneys around the corner. INT. LOBBY, TELEVISION STUDIO -- DAY

Gordon and his men escort Reese out of the elevator- Engel follows with a camera crew. As they approach the glass doors Gordon looks out at an angry crowd.

ENGEL
Commissioner?!	You really think
someone would try to-

Get the cars around back!

Gordon throws Reese in the back.	Smiles.

GORDON
Well, maybe Batman will save you.

The van PEELS out.	Heads onto the streets.

EXT. HOSPITAL -- CONTINUOUS

Cops load patients onto BUSES. A TV van pulls up, Engel and his Cameraman jump out. One of Dent's guards, POLK, looks into a SCHOOL BUS. Turns to the Cop loading it.

POLK
Okay, don't put anyone else on.
(gets on radio)
Davis, I got space, bring him out.
(no answer)
Davis?

Polk heads back towards the hospital, against the flow.

INT. LAMBORGHINI -- CONTINUOUS

Wayne trails the police van from a distance.

POLK
Ma'am, we're going to have to move him, now.

Ma'am?

The Redhead TURNS- it is the Joker, silenced pistol in hand.
He FIRES.

The young cop, BERG, looks up.	Sweating.

BERG
Commissioner?

GORDON
You okay, son?

Berg nods.	Looks at his watch.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- DAY

The Joker draws closer to Dent's bed. Dent STRAINS at the leather cuffs binding him to the bed.

THE JOKER
I don't want there to be any hard

feelings between us, Harvey.

The Joker loosens Dent's restraints.

THE JOKER
When you and Rachel were being abducted I was sitting in Gordon's cage. I didn't rig those charges-

DENT
Your men.	Your plan.

THE JOKER
Do I really look like a guy with a plan, Harvey? I don't have a plan...The mob has plans, the cops have plans. You know what I am, Harvey?
 
107.


Dent's hand is TREMBLING.

THE JOKER
I'm a dog chasing cars... I wouldn't know what to do with one if I caught it. I just do things. I'm just the wrench in the gears. I hate plans. Yours, theirs, everyone's. Maroni has plans. Gordon has plans. Schemers trying to control their worlds. I'm not a schemer, I show the schemers how pathetic their attempts to control things really are. So when I say that you and your girlfriend was nothing personal, you know I'm telling the truth...

Hands him the pistol. Dent holds it to the Joker's head. EXT. INTERSECTION, GOTHAM STREETS -- CONTINUOUS

Wayne ROARS past a line of traffic to settle in a few cars back from the police van, sitting at a red light.

INT. LAMBORGHINI -- CONTINUOUS

Wayne studies the intersection- spots a PICKUP jostling for position on the cross street.

INT. POLICE VAN -- CONTINUOUS

Gordon watches Berg, mentally tracing the trajectory of his shotgun barrel as Berg fiddles with his gun. Gordon starts trying to subtly unholster his own weapon.

GORDON
I'm gonna need your weapon, son.

Berg looks at Gordon.

BERG
What?

INT. LAMBORGHINI -- CONTINUOUS

Wayne watches the driver of the pickup staring intently at the police van. Lining it up.

INT. POLICE VAN -- CONTINUOUS

Reese looks from Berg to Gordon. Berg looks at Gordon, trembling, the barrel of his gun inching lower in the car.

BERG
Why?	Because my wife's in hospital?

GORDON
Yeah.	That would be why.
 
108.


INT. DENT'S HOSPITAL ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

The Joker leans in, pressing his head to the gun's barrel.

THE JOKER
It's the schemers who put you where you are. You were a schemer. You had plans. Look where it got you. I just did what I do best- I took your plan, and I turned it on itself. Look what I've done to this city with a few drums of gas and a couple of bullets. Nobody panics when the expected people get killed. Nobody panics when things go according to plan, even if the plan is horrifying. If I tell the press that tomorrow a gangbanger will get shot, or a truckload of soldiers will be blown up, nobody panics. Because it's all part of the plan. But when I say that one little old mayor will die, everybody loses their minds! Introduce a little anarchy, you upset the established order and everything becomes chaos. I'm an agent of chaos. And you know the thing about chaos, Harvey?

Dent looks into the Joker's eyes.	Finding meaning.

THE JOKER
It's fair.

Dent looks down at the coin in his hands. Turns it over, feels it's comforting weight. Shows the Joker the good side.

DENT
You live.

He turns the coin over.	The flip side is deeply SCARRED.

DENT
You die.

The Joker looks at the coin.	Looks at Dent, admiringly.

THE JOKER
Now you're talking.

Dent FLICKS the coin into the air.	Catches it.	Looks.

EXT. INTERSECTION, GOTHAM STREETS -- CONTINUOUS

The light turns GREEN.	The police van pulls into the
intersection- the pickup GUNS IT, RACING AT IT...
 
109.


INT. LAMBORGHINI -- CONTINUOUS

Wayne FLOORS it, YANKS the wheel to pull up onto the sidewalk-

INT. POLICE VAN -- CONTINUOUS

Berg licks his lips, nervous.

BERG
Mr.Reese?

EXT. INTERSECTION, GOTHAM STREETS -- CONTINUOUS

The pickup BARRELS at the van, FULL TILT- at the last second Wayne's Lamborghini SLIPS alongside the van- the pickup SMASHES INTO THE LAMBORGHINI-

INT. POLICE VAN -- CONTINUOUS

As the van JOLTS with the impact Gordon LEAPS forward,
PUSHING UP Berg's shotgun barrel, which FIRES into the roof-

Gordon SMASHES Berg on the head with his sidearm.

EXT. INTERSECTION, GOTHAM STREETS -- CONTINUOUS

Gordon's men pull the pickup driver from his cab- Gordon crouches down to the Lamborghini wreck to help pull Wayne from the car. Gordon recognizes him as he pulls him free.

GORDON
You okay, Mr.Wayne?

Wayne looks at him, woozy.	Sits on the curb.

WAYNE
Call me Bruce.	I think so.

GORDON
That was a brave thing, you did.

WAYNE
Trying to catch the light?

GORDON
You weren't protecting the van?

Wayne turns- sees the police van as if for the first time.
Reese steps down, dazed.

WAYNE
Why?	Who's in it?

Reese locks eyes with Wayne. Nods. Gordon sizes up Bruce Wayne and his crushed sports car.

GORDON
You don't watch a whole lot of news, do you, Mr.Wayne?
 
110.


WAYNE
(shrugs)

It can get a little intense. Think I should go to hospital?

GORDON
Not today, I wouldn't.

INT. CORRIDOR, HOSPITAL -- CONTINUOUS

The Joker walks calmly through the mostly deserted building. As he walks he pulls a DETONATOR from his pocket. Strolling along he PUSHES THE BUTTON... STAGGERED EXPLOSIONS BURST INTO THE CORRIDOR BEHIND HIM LIKE DEMOLITION BLASTS... the Joker just walks out the door...

EXT. HOSPITAL -- CONTINUOUS

The Joker STROLLS down the steps- WINDOWS BLOW OUT IN SERIES-People DIVE for cover- Engel PILES into a school bus-

The Joker walks across the parking lot- THE BUILDING COLLAPSING BEHIND HIM...

EXT. INTERSECTION, GOTHAM STREETS -- CONTINUOUS Gordon hears the EXPLOSION.
GORDON
Gotham general...
(grabs his phone)

Did you get Dent out?

COP (O.S.)
I think so-

EXT. HOSPITAL -- CONTINUOUS

The Cop cowers as DEBRIS and SMOKE BLAST across the street-

INT. SCHOOL BUS -- CONTINUOUS

The Joker gets onto the bus.	Nods at his man at the wheel.

EXT. HOSPITAL -- CONTINUOUS

All eyes are on the collapsed building. One school bus pulls out from the line of other buses. Heads down the street.

INT. BAR, GOTHAM HEIGHTS -- DAY

An empty neighborhood dive, the local DRUNK passed out at the bar, BARTENDER, watching BREAKING NEWS on the TV.

BARTENDER
Sweet Jesus.	D'you see this, Mike?
They blew up a hospital...
 
111.


Detective Wuertz, at a booth looks up at the TV, bored.

BARTENDER
Shouldn't you be out there, you know, doing something?

WUERTZ
It's my day off.

The Bartender shuts the register.

BARTENDER
I gotta take a leak, keep an eye on things, will ya?

The Bartender steps out.	The back door OPENS again.

WUERTZ
What?	You need me to shake it for-

He TRAILS off as someone sticks a gun in his face: Harvey Dent. Standing in shadow. He sits.

DENT
Hello.

WUERTZ
Dent, I thought you was...dead...

Dent leans into the light. The left side of his face is HIDEOUSLY BURNED, cheek gone, blackened teeth and gums.

DENT
Half.

Dent picks up Wuertz's drink. Takes a SIP. Wuertz watches the bare muscles RETRACT as Dent SWALLOWS.

DENT
Who picked up Rachel, Wuertz?

WUERTZ
It must've been Maroni's men-

Dent SLAMS the glass back on the table- Wuertz FLINCHES.

DENT
You, of all people, are gonna protect the other traitor in Gordon's unit?

WUERTZ
I don't know- he'd never tell me.
(stares at Dent)

I swear to God, I didn't know what they were gonna do to you-
 
112.


DENT
Funny, I don't know what's going to happen to you, either.

Dent pulls his coin from his pocket. FLIPS it. Wuertz watches it SPIN. It lands on the table. Scarred side up. The drunk at the bar STIRS at the GUNSHOT.

EXT. GOTHAM GENERAL -- DAY

Gordon, manic, surveys the scene with a Cop-

GORDON
You must know how many were inside-you've got patient lists, roll calls-

COP
Sir! Sir. Take a look at what we're dealing with. Cops, National Guard-
(gestures at buses)

We're showing 50 missing- but that building was clear. These buses are heading off to other hospitals- my guess is we missed one.

GORDON
Yeah?	What's your guess about where
Harvey Dent is?

The cop says nothing.

GORDON
Keep looking.	Keep it to yourself.

INT. FOX'S OFFICE WAYNE INDUSTRIES -- DAY

Fox is watching the news.	His intercom buzzes.

VOICE (O.S.)
Mr.Fox? Security is showing a break-in at the R and D department.

INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT -- DAY

Fox watches two security men force the door. He enters alone.

INT. LAB, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT -- DAY

Fox enters the dimly-lit room. At one end is an extraordinary array of thousands of tiny monitors. Fox approaches, fascinated, as they quietly display architectural patterns individually and in concert. The images become a MAP.

BATMAN
Beautiful.	Isn't it?
 
113.


Fox nods, staring at the monitors as Batman approaches.

FOX
Beautiful. Unethical. Dangerous. You've turned every phone in the city into a microphone...

Lucius presses a key. The BABBLE of a MILLION CONVERSATIONS at once fills the room. Every cell phone in the city.

BATMAN
And high frequency

generator/receiver.

FOX
Like the phone I gave you in Hong Kong. You took my sonar concept and applied it to everybody's phone in the City. With half the city feeding you sonar you can image all of Gotham.
(turns to Batman)
This is wrong.

BATMAN
I've got to find this man, Lucius.

FOX
But at what cost?

BATMAN
The database is null-key encrypted. It can only be accessed by one person.

FOX
No one should have that kind of

power.

WAYNE
That's why I gave it to you. Only you can use it.

Lucius looks at Batman.	Hard.

FOX
Spying on thirty million people

wasn't in my job description.

Batman points to a TV screen. Fox turns. ON SCREEN: the Joker shakes his head above a graphic "LATEST THREAT"...
 

THE JOKER
What does it take to make you people want to join in..?
 
114.


EXT. SITUATION TENT AT GOTHAM GENERAL -- CONTINUOUS

Gordon watches a screen.	Grave.

THE JOKER
You failed to kill the lawyer... I've got to get you off the bench and into the game. So, here it is...

INT. BAR, DOWNTOWN -- CONTINUOUS

The bar, packed with business people watches the TV.	SILENT.

THE JOKER
Come nightfall, this city is mine, and anyone left here plays by my rules. If you don't want to be in the game, get out now.

Bar patrons start moving... The Joker reaches for the camera-

THE JOKER
But the bridge-and-tunnel crowd are in for a surprise.

CUT TO STATIC. The bar patrons look around, confused.

INT. LAB, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT -- CONTINUOUS

Fox turns from the TV to look at Batman.

BATMAN
Trust me.

Fox stares at Batman.

BATMAN
This is the audio sample.

He plugs a USB dongle into the console. A sample of the Joker's voice from the call-in news program plays.

BATMAN
If he talks within range of any phone in the city, you'll be able to triangulate his position.

Lucius toggles a menu. The city is an open book- People working, eating, sleeping. Lucius shakes his head.

BATMAN
When you've finished, type your name to switch it off.

FOX
I'll help you this one time...

Lucius sits at the console.	Batman moves off-
 
115.


FOX
But consider this my resignation.

Batman turns.	Fox looks at him, serious.

FOX
As long as this machine is at Wayne Industries, I won't be.

EXT. VARIOUS LOCATIONS -- DUSK

Gothamites POUR out of the city, on foot and by car... the BRIDGES and TUNNELS are deserted, but for BOMB SQUAD search teams.

INT. CITY HALL -- CONTINUOUS

Gordon briefs the Mayor.

GORDON
My officers are going over every inch of the tunnels and bridges, but with the Joker's threat they're not and option.

MAYOR
Land routes East?

GORDON
Backed up for hours. Which leaves the ferries with thirty thousand waiting to board. Plus, corrections are at capacity, so I want to use a ferry to take some prisoners off the island.

MAYOR
The men you and Dent put away? Those aren't people I'm worried about.

GORDON
You should be- they're the people you least want to be stuck with in an emergency. Whatever the Joker's planning, it's a good bet that Harvey's prisoners might be involved. I want 'em out of here.

EXT. FERRY TERMINAL -- DUSK

At the ferry terminal, National Guardsman watch over the THIRTY THOUSAND jostling, scared people waiting to board the two MASSIVE FERRIES to Seven Sisters. Grumbles turn to YELLS as 800 PRISONERS are loaded onto a ferry by shotgun-toting

CORRECTIONS OFFICERS.
 
116.


CIVILIAN
That ain't right! We should be on that boat.

NATIONAL GUARDSMAN
You want to ride across with them, be my guest.

EXT. BROWNSTONE -- DUSK

Maroni climbs into the back of a limo.

INT. LIMO -- DUSK

Maroni settles back into his seat.	The car pulls away.

MARONI
Don't stop for lights, cops, nothing.

DENT
Going to join your wife?

Maroni STARTS. Someone is in here with him. Harvey Dent-Two Face- leans forward, clutching a pistol.

DENT
You love her?

MARONI
Yes.

DENT
Can you imagine what it would be like to listen to her die?

MARONI
Take it up with the Joker. He killed your woman. Made you... like this...

DENT
The Joker's just a mad dog. I want whoever let him off the leash.

Maroni looks at Dent.	Worried.

DENT
I took care of Wuertz, but who was your other man inside Gordon's unit? Who picked up Rachel? It must've been someone she trusted.

MARONI
If I tell you, will you let me go?

DENT
It can't hurt your chances.
 
117.


MARONI
It was Ramirez.

Pulls out his coin.	Dent cocks the pistol...

MARONI
But you said-

DENT
I said it couldn't hurt your chances.

Dent FLIPS it.	Looks: good side.	He shrugs.

DENT
Lucky guy.

Maroni looks confused. Dent FLIPS the coin again. Looks down at the coin. Shakes his head.

DENT
But he's not.

MARONI
Who?

Dent smiles.	PUTS HIS SEAT BELT ON.

DENT
Your driver.

Dent presses the barrel of the revolver behind the shadow of the driver. Maroni LUNGES, SCREAMING. Dent FIRES.

EXT. BRIDGE -- DUSK

The Limo SWERVES off of the bridge, SOARS out over the canal, and PANCAKES into the RETAINING WALL.

EXT. FERRY TERMINAL -- DUSK

CIVILIANS CRAM their way onto one ferry. Finally, the COMMANDER of the National Guard unit SIGNALS to his men to STOP BOARDING and CAST OFF.

The two FERRIES set off across the river, heading for the lights of the distant shore of the mainland.

INT. BRIDGE, PRISONER FERRY -- NIGHT

The FIRST MATE looks out the window, at the second ferry. It is DEAD in the WATER. He turns to the PILOT [PRISON FERRY].

FIRST MATE
They've lost their engines.
 
118.


PILOT [PRISON FERRY]
Get on the radio and tell 'em we'll
come back for them once we dump these

scumbags-

Suddenly, the control panel FLICKERS and DIES.

PILOT [PRISON FERRY]
Get down to the engine room.

INT. PASSENGER LOUNGE, PRISONER FERRY -- NIGHT

The First Mate skirts around the PRISONERS and CORRECTIONS
OFFICERS...

INT. ACCESS CORRIDOR, PRISONER FERRY -- NIGHT

The First Mate opens the door to the engine room.	STOPS.

HUNDREDS OF BARRELS OF DIESEL FUEL. And a small, wrapped PRESENT, topped with a BOW.

INT. BRIDGE, PRISONER FERRY -- NIGHT

The Pilot [Prison Ferry] is holding the small present. His radio CRACKLES.

PILOT [PASSENGER FERRY] (O.S.)
Same thing over here- enough diesel
to blow us sky high.	And a present.

EXT. ELEVATED ROADWAY, DOWTOWN GOTHAM -- CONTINUOUS

Batman sits on the bat-pod, cape blowing.	Listening.

BATMAN
Fox? There's something going on on the ferries...

INT. PASSENGER LOUNGE, COMMUTER FERRY -- NIGHT

As cold scared Families watch, the NATIONAL GUARD COMMANDER UNWRAPS that ferry's present. Inside, he finds a crude REMOTE DETONATOR.

NATIONAL GUARD COMMANDER Why would they give us the detonator to our own bomb?

Up in the wiring at the ceiling, a CELL PHONE taped in to the P.A. rings and answers.

THE JOKER (O.S.)
Tonight, you're all going to be part of a social experiment.

ON BOTH FERRIES: CIVILIANS, PRISONERS, CREW, AND NATIONAL GUARDSMEN ALL LISTEN AS THE JOKER'S VOICE RINGS OUT.
 
119.


INT. LAB, WAYNE ENTERPRISES -- NIGHT

Lucius Fox looks up as the console CHIMES.

FOX
I'm zeroing in.

THE JOKER (O.S.)
Through the magic of diesel fuel and ammonium nitrate, I'm ready right now to blow you all sky high. Anyone attempts to get off their boat, you all die...

FOX
His voice is on the ferry, but that's not the source...

EXT. ROOFTOPS ABOVE GOTHAM -- NIGHT

Batman looks out, across the entire city skyline.

BATMAN
Do you have a location on the Joker?

FOX
It's west...

Batman FIRES UP the bat-pod- his cape SHRINKS into its pack form as he PEELS OUT, ROARING into the night.

THE JOKER (O.S.)
But we're going to make things a little more interesting than that. Tonight, we're going to learn a little bit about ourselves...

INT. GORDON HOME -- CONTINUOUS

Barbara Gordon answers the phone.

RAMIREZ (O.S.)
Barbara, it's Anna Ramirez-

BARBARA
Hi, Anna-

RAMIREZ (O.S.)
Listen carefully, there's no time. Jim needs you to pack up and get the kids in the car right away.

BARBARA
But the units outside-
 
120.


RAMIREZ (O.S.)
Barbara, those cops can't be trusted. Jim needs you away from them as soon as possible. I'll call them off for 10 minutes, you'll have to move fast-

BARBARA
But where-

RAMIREZ (O.S.)
I'm going to give you an address- Jim will meet you there...

EXT. MCU -- CONTINUOUS

Ramirez is holding the phone.

RAMIREZ
250, 52nd street. Leave as soon as the patrol car pulls out.

Dent is holding a gun at Ramirez's head.	She hangs up.

DENT
She believe you?

Ramirez nods.

DENT
She trusts you.	Just like Rachel
did.

RAMIREZ
I didn't know-

DENT
'What they were gonna do'? You're the second cop to say that to me. What, exactly, did you think they were going to do?

RAMIREZ
I'm sorry- they got me early on. My mother's medical bills and my-

DENT
Don't!

Dent FLIPS his coin.

RAMIREZ
I took a little from them- once they've got you, they keep you. I'm sorry.

Dent looks at his coin.	Good side.
 
121.


DENT
Live to fight another day, officer.

Dent CRACKS her on the head with his gun.

INT. BRIDGE, PRISONER FERRY -- NIGHT

The Pilot [Prison Ferry] tries the radio.	It's DEAD.

PILOT [PRISON FERRY]
He killed the radio.

THE JOKER (O.S.)
There's no need for all of you to
die.	That would be a waste.	So I've
left you both a little present.

EXT. PENTHOUSE, PREWITT BUILDING -- NIGHT

The Joker stares out over the harbor, at the ferries. Talking into a cell phone. Holding a detonator, with TWO BUTTONS.

THE JOKER
Each of you has a remote to blow up the other boat.

INT. PASSENGER LOUNGE, PRISONER FERRY -- NIGHT

The Prisoners and Corrections Officers listen.	Appalled.

THE JOKER (O.S.)
At midnight, I blow you all up. If, however, one of you presses the button, I'll let that boat live. You choose. So who's it going to be-Harvey Dent's most wanted scumbag collection... or the sweet innocent civilians?
(beat)

Oh, and you might want to decide quickly, because the people on the other boat may not be quite so noble.

The Joker HANGS UP. The Pilot [Prisoner Ferry] looks down at the remote in his hands. Prisoners begin YELLING and PUSHING. The WARDEN takes the remote from the Pilot- COCKS his shotgun. His men level their weapons at the crowd.

EXT. FERRY TERMINAL -- CONTINUOUS

Gordon looks out at the ferries.	His phone rings.

BATMAN
I have the Joker's location-
 
122.


EXT. GOTHAM STREETS -- CONTINUOUS

BATMAN
Prewitt building. Assemble on the building opposite.

INT. PASSENGER LOUNGE, COMMUTER FERRY -- NIGHT

The National Guard Commander is holding the remote. Several passengers take a step towards him. He PULLS his weapon.

NATIONAL GUARD COMMANDER
Stay back.

A BUSINESSMAN clutching his briefcase speaks up.

BUSINESSMAN
Who are you to decide? We ought to talk it over, at least.

Other passengers agree.	A MOTHER with two KIDS speaks up.

MOTHER
We don't all have to die. Why should my babies die? Those men had their chance-

NATIONAL GUARD COMMANDER We're not talking about this...

PASSENGER 1
They're talking over the same exact thing on the other boat.

PASSENGER 2
If they're even bothering to talk.

Let's put it to a vote.

INT. PASSENGER LOUNGE, PRISONER FERRY -- NIGHT

As the Prisoners grow angrier, a CORRECTIONS OFFICER FIRES his shotgun into the air. The Prisoners back off. Slightly.

INT. PASSENGER LOUNGE, COMMUTER FERRY -- NIGHT

A GUARDSMAN on this boat passes around a hat.	People drop
CHITS into it.	Passengers filling out chits eye each other.
People on their phones say goodbye to loved ones.

The Pilot [Passenger Ferry] looks out across the water to the other Ferry. Looks up at the clock. Ten to midnight...

STARES down at his blank chit.
 
123.


EXT. ROOFTOP OVERLOOKING PREWITT BUILDING -- NIGHT

Gordon and his SWAT team leaders set up SNIPER and SCOPE positions on the balustrade.

INT. GARAGE, PREWITT BUILDING -- CONTINUOUS

A SWAT stands beside the empty school bus.

SWAT
We've found our missing bus.

EXT. ROOFTOP OVERLOOKING PREWITT BUILDING -- CONTINUOUS

Gordon looks at the SWAT LEADER.

GORDON
Then we have a hostage situation.

They look across at the large windows of the Prewitt Building. The Joker's men, in crude, homemade CLOWN MASKS are clearly visible, automatic weapons in hand.

SWAT SNIPER
I got hostages!

They look through his scope. Crouched deeper in the room, PATIENTS, DOCTORS, and NURSES, huddled.

GORDON
It's a shooting gallery. Why'd he choose a spot with such big windows?

BATMAN
He likes the view.

Batman gestures towards the view of the ferries.

SWAT LEADER
We have clear shots on five clowns. Snipers take them out, smash the windows- a team rappels in, a team moves in by the stairwells. 2 or 3 or three casualties, max.

GORDON
(barely hesitates)

Let's do it.

BATMAN
It's not that simple.	With the

Joker, it never is.

GORDON
What's simple, is that every second we don't take him, those people on the ferries get closer to blowing each other up!
 
124.


BATMAN
That won't happen.

GORDON
Then he'll blow them both up!

There's no time- we have to go in now-

BATMAN
There's always a catch with him-

GORDON
That's why we can't wait- we can't play his games-

Batman turns.

BATMAN
I need five minutes.	Alone-

GORDON
No. There's no time. We have clear shots.

Gordon pulls his gun.	Batman turns back.	The SWATS watch.

GORDON
Dent's in there with them. We have to save Dent! I have to save Dent!
(to SWAT Leader)

Get ready-

Batman LEAPS from the building, OPENS his cape- SOARS across the gulf between the two buildings- Gordon puts his weapon away. Curses softly. Turns to the SWAT leader.

GORDON
Two minutes.	Then you breach.

EXT. PREWITT BUILDING -- CONTINUOUS

Batman LANDS against the glass two floors below-

BATMAN

EXT. PREWITT BUILDING -- CONTINUOUS

SMOKED GLASS EYEPIECES slip down over Batman's eye holes. Batman's SONAR P.O.V.: the layers of the building dissolve, levels of TRANSPARENCY PULSING rhythmically... Batman can see the people inside the building...

INT. PENTHOUSE, PREWITT BUILDING -- NIGHT

The Joker is standing by the window, looking out at his handiwork. The Chechen's DOGS start BARKING. He SMILES.

EXT. PENTHOUSE, PREWITT BUILDING -- CONTINUOUS

Batman reaches into his utility belt, SPRAYS PLASTIC onto the glass- lets it harden- PUNCHES the window-which BREAKS QUIETLY as the pieces stick to the laminate- he slips inside-

INT. PENTHOUSE, PREWITT BUILDING -- CONTINUOUS

Batman's eyes glow white as he uses his sonar to look THROUGH

Hello?	Barbara, calm down-

DENT (O.S.)
Hello, Jim.

GORDON
Harvey?	What the hell's going on?

DENT (O.S.)
You're about to know what my
suffering is really like...

Gordon looks across at the Prewitt penthouse...

GORDON (O.S.)
Where are you?	Where's my family?!

DENT
Where my family died.

Click.	Gordon looks at the SWAT leader.	Pale.
 
126.


SWAT LEADER
Red Team.	Go!

Gordon moves to the door off the roof.

INT. PENTHOUSE, PREWITT BUILDING -- CONTINUOUS

Batman GRABS the Armed Clown, drops him, silently. He goes to disarm him- THE WEAPON IS DUCT-TAPED TO THE CLOWN'S HANDS. Batman RIPS off the clown mask:

STARING, FRIGHTENED EYES- MOUTH DUCT-TAPED SHUT... it's ENGEL.

Batman looks up: Four more clowns line the windows, weapons
duct-taped to their hands. On SONAR: he looks into where the hostages are crouched... the "PATIENTS" and "DOCTORS" are carrying weapons- these are the Joker's men... Above them SWATS RAPPEL FROM THE ROOFTOP. ~In the stairwells, two more teams prepping.

BATMAN
Don't.	Move.

Engel nods, terrified.

EXT. ROOFTOP OVERLOOKING PREWITT BUILDING -- CONTINUOUS

The SWATS line up the clowns in their sights...

The "hostages" reel from the BLAST- The SWATS SWOOP in-aiming weapons at the clowns, throwing PERCUSSION GRENADES-Batman takes out the SWATS with fists and BATARANGS-

The last SWAT aims at BATMAN- behind him a "DOCTOR" raises a shotgun... behind the "Doctor" Batman can see through the wall at SWATS preparing to breach... Batman VAULTS over the SWAT into a two-foot kick into the "Doctor's" chest-

INT. STAIRWELL, PREWITT BUILDING -- CONTINUOUS

The Swats BLAST OUT THE WALL- the team leader steps up to the hole... the BAT-GRAPPLE FIRES out-lodging in his kevlar vest... he is YANKED, SCREAMING, through the door. The rest of his team look at each other. Steel themselves. Move in through the hole...

INT. PENTHOUSE, PREWITT BUILDING -- CONTINUOUS

As the SWATS race in they find Engel, terrified, next to a pile of unconscious "hostages", and their team leader, one end of an absailing rope tied around his waist. Batman is on them, weaving KICKING, PUNCHING, and, with one hand, clipping carabinners looped to the absailing rope onto their webbing of vests.

Batman steps back- picks up the team leader- SWAT weapons aim at him- he hurls the Team Leader out the window... the SWATS watch him go... the rope pays out... one by one they are YANKED out of the window...

EXT. ROOFTOP OVERLOOKING PREWITT BUILDING -- CONTINUOUS

A SNIPER watches through his scope as the six man SWAT team soars out of the window and drops. The line snaps taut and they hang, like a mountaineering team in crisis. Batman, crouched in the broken window, secures the line.

SNIPER
What the hell's he doing?

Batman looks right at the sniper- Raises his grapple gun-BAM. The bat grapple smashes into the Sniper's scope- the rifle is YANKED out of his hands.

INT. PREWITT BUILDING -- CONTINUOUS

Batman races past a dazed Engel...

ENGEL

Thanks.

Do you wanna die!

The Warden and his men look at each other. At the clock. INT. PENTHOUSE, PREWITT BUILDING -- NIGHT

Batman WRESTLES with the Rotweilers- a blinding mass of Batman, black fur and bared teeth-

The Joker POPS a switchblade. Moves in to the mass- Batman KICKS OFF the last of the dogs- the Joker JABS his knife into Batman's RIBS-

THE JOKER
All the old familiar places.

Batman recoils in pain.	The Joker BUTTS him- KNEES him-
ENERGY explodes from his lean frame- he KICKS the injured

Batman back towards the glass...

INT. PASSENGER LOUNGE, COMMUTER FERRY -- NIGHT

The Pilot [Passenger Ferry] looks at the remote in his hands.

PILOT [PASSENGER FERRY]
I voted for it. Same as most of you. Doesn't seem right that we should all die...

Someone calls out from the back.
 
129.


PASSENGER 3
So do it!

PILOT [PASSENGER FERRY] I didn't say I'd do it. Don't forget. We're still here. Which means they haven't killed us, yet, either.

He sets the remote down on a bench in the front of the lounge. The other passengers and guardsmen stare at it...

INT. PASSENGER LOUNGE, PRISONER FERRY -- NIGHT

A HUGE, TATTOOED PRISONER pushes his way to the front. He walks towards the Warden, who is sweating, looking at the remote.

TATTOOED PRISONER
You don't wanna die. But you don't know how to take a life. Give it to me.

The Warden looks at the remote.	At the clock.

TATTOOED PRISONER
These men will kill you and take it, anyway. Give it to me, you can tell people I took it by force... give it to me and I'll do what you should have done ten minutes ago.

INT. PASSENGER LOUNGE, COMMUTER FERRY -- NIGHT

Everyone stares at the remote. One minute left. The Businessman stands. Walks over and picks it up.

BUSINESSMAN
No one wants to get their hands dirty. Fine. I'll do it. Those men on that boat made their choices. They chose to murder and steal. It makes no sense for us to die, too.

He looks at the other passengers.	No one makes eye contact.

INT. PASSENGER LOUNGE, PRISONER FERRY -- NIGHT

The Warden slowly hands him the REMOTE.	The Prisoner looks
at it.	He looks the Warden in the eye...

Then TOSSES the remote out the window.

Warden, prisoners and officers are stunned.
 
130.


EXT. PENTHOUSE, PREWITT BUILDING -- NIGHT

Batman FLIES backwards THROUGH THE WINDOW- glass flying- the Joker KICKS out a wooden brace holding up the STEEL FRAME-Batman's arms fly up as it comes crashing down onto his neck-saved by his protective gauntlets. Batman GRUNTS as the Joker STEPS onto the steel beam...

THE JOKER
If we don't stop fighting, we're

going to miss the fireworks.

BATMAN
There won't be any fireworks.

Batman STRUGGLES to keep the beam from CRUSHING his neck... INT. PASSENGER LOUNGE, COMMUTER FERRY -- NIGHT

The Businessman stares at the remote in his hands. Finally, he puts it down. Sits down. Waits to die.

The clock strikes MIDNIGHT.

EXT. PENTHOUSE, PREWITT BUILDING -- NIGHT

Batman indicates the clock...	twelve o'clock.

BATMAN
What were you hoping to prove? That deep down, we're all as ugly as you?

The Joker looks at the clock...

INT. BOTH FERRIES -- CONTINUOUS

The Passengers brace.	Look at the clock.	Confused...

INT. PREWITT BUILDING -- CONTINUOUS

The smile disappears from the Joker's face.

BATMAN
You're alone.

The Joker CROUCHES down, hovering above Batman's face and arms. Shows him the remote.

THE JOKER
Can't rely on anyone these days.

The Joker ARMS the remote...

THE JOKER
Have to do everything yourself. I always have- and it's not always easy...

(MORE)
 
131.
THE JOKER (cont'd)
(smiles, remembering)
You know how I got these scars?

Batman looks up at him.

BATMAN
No.	But I know how you get these-

Batman's SCALLOP BLADES FIRE OUT OF HIS GAUNTLET, nailing the Joker in the chest and arm- he STAGGERS back- Batman, freed, leaps forward- KICKS HIM OVER THE EDGE- GRABS the remote-

The Joker GIGGLES as he FALLS, enjoying the ride. Something SLAMS into his leg, and he JERKS to a stop- BATMAN'S GRAPPLE. The Joker HOLLERS in pain as Batman HAULS him up.

THE JOKER
Just couldn't let me go, could you? I guess this is what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object. You truly are incorruptible, aren't you?

Batman secures the Joker UPSIDE DOWN.	The Joker is LAUGHING.

THE JOKER
You won't kill me out of some misplaced sense of self-righteousness... and I won't kill you because you're too much fun. We're going to do this forever.

BATMAN
You'll be in a padded cell, forever.

THE JOKER
Maybe we can share it. They'll need to double up, the rate this city's inhabitants are losing their minds...

BATMAN
This city just showed you it's full of people ready to believe in good.

The Joker looks up at him.	A twinkle in his eye.

THE JOKER
Till their spirit breaks completely. Until they find out what I did with the best of them. Until they get a good look at the real Harvey Dent, and all the heroic things he's done.
(indicates ferry)

Then those criminals will be straight back onto the streets and Gotham will understand the true nature of heroism.
(off look)

(MORE)
 
132.
THE JOKER (cont'd)
You didn't think I'd risk losing the battle for the soul of Gotham in a fist fight with you? You've got to have an ace in the hole. Mine's Harvey.

Batman hauls the Joker up, nose to nose.

BATMAN
What did you do?

THE JOKER
I took Gotham's white knight. And I brought him down to my level. It wasn't hard- madness is like gravity. All it takes is a little push.

Joker laughs.	Batman leaves him to the SWATS.

BATMAN
Lucius.	Find Harvey Dent.

EXT. BURNT WAREHOUSE, 52ND STREET -- NIGHT

Gordon gets out of his car, gun drawn.	Makes his way into
the blackened wreck of a building...

INT. BURNT WAREHOUSE, 52ND STREET -- NIGHT

Gordon peers into the darkness.

GORDON
Dent?

No reply.	Gordon makes his way deeper.	Up the stairs.

INT. SECOND FLOOR, BURNT WAREHOUSE -- NIGHT

Gordon spots Barbara and their two children huddled together. He moves towards them- Barbara is shaking her head-

WHAM! Dent cracks Gordon over the head with his gun. Dent disarms Gordon, rolls him over. He turns to look at the ENORMOUS hole in the floor. From this side, in the moonlight, Dent looks completely normal.

DENT
This is where they brought her, Gordon. After your people handed her over. This is where they bound her. This is where she suffered. This is where she died.

GORDON
I know. I was here. Trying to save her.

Dent TURNS, revealing his dark side.
 
133.


DENT
But you didn't, did you?

GORDON
I couldn't.

DENT
Yes, you could.

DENT
If you'd listened to me- if you'd stood up against corruption instead of doing your deal with the devil.

GORDON
I was trying to fight the mob-

Dent MOVES towards Gordon.

DENT
You wouldn't dare try to justify yourself if you knew what I'd lost. Have you ever had to talk to the person you love most, wondering if you're about to listen to them die? You ever had to lie to that person? Tell them it's going to be all right, when you know it's not? Well, you're about to find out what that feels like. Then you'll be able to look me in the eye and tell me you're sorry.

Dent turns- steps over to Barbara- puts the gun to her temple-

GORDON
Harvey. Put the gun down. You're not going to hurt my family.

DENT
No, just the person you need most.
(cocks gun)

So is it your wife?

GORDON
Put the gun down.

Dent moves the gun to point at Gordon's little girl.

GORDON
Please, Harvey...
 

Dent moves to James Gordon.
boy's eyes with the muzzle.
 


Brushes the hair out of the Gordon SNAPS.

 
GORDON
Goddamit. Stop pointing that gun at my family, Dent.
 
134.


DENT
We have a winner.

Dent pulls the boy away from his mother.

BARBARA
No!	Jim stop him!	Don't let him!

Dent walks James past Gordon to the edge of the burnt floor.
He touches the raw wood at the edge of the floor.

GORDON
I'm sorry, Harvey.	For everything.
But, please.	Please don't hurt him.

SIRENS.

EXT. BURNT WAREHOUSE, 52ND STREET -- CONTINUOUS

Cop cars descend on the warehouse.

INT. SECOND FLOOR, BURNT WAREHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

Dent looks at Gordon, FURIOUS.

DENT
You brought your cops?

GORDON
All they know is there's a situation.
They don't know who, or what.

They're just creating a perimeter.

DENT
You think I want to escape?! There's no escape from this-

Dent indicates his face.	His suffering.

GORDON
No one needs to escape, because no one's done anything wrong. And nobody has to.

Dent chuckles.	A macabre sight.

DENT
I've done plenty wrong, Gordon. Just not quite enough. Yet.

Dent squeezes the gun a little tighter against the little boy's neck. The boy WHIMPERS.

BATMAN
You don't want to hurt the boy, Dent.

Dent turns.	Batman steps from the shadows.
 
135.


DENT
It's not about what I want.	It's
about what's fair.
(to Gordon and Batman)
You thought we could be decent men in an indecent world. You thought we could lead by example. You thought the rules could be bent but not break... you were wrong. The world is cruel.
(shows his coin)
And the only morality in a cruel
world is chance.	Unbiased.
Unprejudiced.	Fair.

BATMAN
Nothing fair ever came out of the

barrel of a gun, Dent.

DENT
(shows the coin)
His boy's got the same chance she

had.	Fifty-fifty.

Batman steps closer, desperate, trying to reach Dent.

BATMAN
What happened to Rachel wasn't chance. We decided to act. We three. We knew the risks and we acted as one. We are all responsible for the consequences.

Dent looks at Batman.	Pleading.

DENT
Then why was it only me who lost

everything?

Batman looks into Dent's eyes.	Emotional.

BATMAN
It wasn't.

DENT
(furious)

The Joker chose me!

BATMAN
Because you were the best of us. He wanted to prove that even someone as good as you could fall.

DENT
(bitter)

And he was right.
 
136.


BATMAN
But your fooling yourself if you think you're letting chance decide. You're the one pointing the gun, Harvey. So point it at the people who were responsible. We all acted as one. Gordon. Me. And you.

Dent is listening, the wheels in his deranged mind turning.

DENT
Fair enough.

Dent eases his grip on the boy.

DENT
You first.

He points the gun at Batman. FLIPS the coin. TAILS. He SHOOTS. Batman COLLAPSES to the ground, clutching his gut.

DENT
My turn.

He points the gun at his own head.	FLIPS the coin.	HEADS.
He looks a little disappointed.

Finally, he points the gun back at Gordon's son.

DENT
Your turn, Gordon.

GORDON
You're right, Harvey. Rachel's death was my fault. But punish me-

DENT
I'm about to. Tell your son it's going to be all right, Gordon. Lie. Like I lied.

Gordon looks up.	Pained.	Locks eyes with his son.

GORDON
It's going to be all right, son.

Dent FLIPS the coin. High. Dent's eyes FOLLOW the coin up-Batman HURLS himself at Dent and the boy.

All three of them VANISH over the edge. A TERRIBLE CRASH-then silence, but for the sound of DENT'S COIN, SPINNING on the floor at the edge of the hole.

Gordon, horrified, RUNS to the edge- peers down-

Dent lies at the bottom of the hole, his neck broken.	DEAD.

The coin stops spinning, GOOD SIDE UP.
 
137.


Gordon's son swings into view, HANGING from Batman, who is holding onto a JOIST with all his strength...

Gordon reaches down to GRAB his son- HAULS him up...

Batman FALLS..., dropping and dropping, SMASHING THROUGH protruding WOOD and PIPES... He lands HARD near Dent.

EXT. BURNT WAREHOUSE, 52ND STREET -- CONTINUOUS

The cops prepare to STORM the front door.

INT. BURNT WAREHOUSE, 52ND STREET -- CONTINUOUS

Gordon races down the stairs.	Rushes over to Batman.

JAMES
Dad, is he okay?

Gordon crouches at Batman's side. The Batman GRASPS Gordon's arm. STAGGERS to his feet.

GORDON
Thank-you.

BATMAN
You don't have to-

GORDON
Yes, I do.

Gordon and Batman stare down at Dent's body.	Grave.

GORDON
The Joker won.

Gordon stares down at SCARRED SIDE of Harvey Dent.

GORDON
Harvey's prosecution, everything he fought for, everything Rachel died for. Undone. Whatever chance Gotham had of fixing itself... whatever chance you gave us of fixing our city... dies with Harvey's reputation. We bet it all on him. The Joker took the best of us and tore him down. People will lose all hope.

BATMAN
No.	They won't.
(looks at Gordon)
They can never know what he did.
 
138.


GORDON
(incredulous)
Five dead?	Two of them cops?	We
can't sweep that under-

BATMAN
No.	But the Joker cannot win.

Batman crouches to Dent's body.

BATMAN
Gotham needs its true hero.

Gently, he turns Dent's head so the good side of his face is up. Gordon looks from Dent's face to Batman. Understanding.

GORDON
You?	You can't-

BATMAN
Yes, I can.

Batman stands.	Faces Gordon.

BATMAN
You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain. I can do those things because I'm not a hero, like Dent. I killed those people. That's what I can be.

GORDON
(angry)

No, you can't!	You're not!

Batman hands Gordon his police radio.

BATMAN
I'm whatever Gotham needs me to be.

INSERT CUT: GORDON STANDS AT A PODIUM AT DENT'S FUNERAL.
BEHIND HIM IS A LARGE PHOTOGRAPH OF DENT SMILING.

GORDON
...a hero. Not the hero we deserved-the hero we needed. Nothing less than a knight. Shining...

They'll hunt you.
 

BATMAN (V.O.)
You'll hunt me.

Batman?!

James RUNS down the stairs to join father-

JAMES (CONT’D)
Why's he running, Dad?!

Gordon stares after Batman.

GORDON
Because we have to chase him...

EXT. WAREHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

As Cops race into the buildings the DOGS get the scent and pull away from the doorway, following the SHADOW into the stacks of shipping containers...

INT. WAREHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

James looks at his father, confused.

JAMES
He didn't do anything wrong!

Gordon stares after the Batman. The sound of the dogs becoming louder and more ferocious.
 
140.


JAMES (CONT’D)
Why, dad?	Why?!

GORDON
Because...

EXT. DOCKSIDE ROOFTOPS -- CONTINUOUS

The Batman LURCHES between shipping containers.	STUMBLING.
BLEEDING.	He makes it to the bat-pod...

GORDON (V.O.)
...he's the hero Gotham deserves... but not the one it needs right now. So we'll hunt him, because he can take it. Because he's not our hero...

The bat-pod streaks through Gotham's underground streets, the Batman's cape fluttering behind. A wraith...

GORDON (V.O.)
...he's a silent guardian, a watchful protector... a dark knight.

The Batman races up a ramp into a blinding light-

CUT TO BLACK.

CREDITS.
