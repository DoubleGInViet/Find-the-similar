FADE UP ON

THE SOUTH BOSTON HOUSING PROJECTS. A MAZE OF BUILDINGS AGAINST THE HARBOR.

COSTELLO (V.O.)
I don’t want to be a product of my environment. I want my environment to be a product…of me.

YELLOW RIPPLES PAST THE CAMERA AND WHEN IT CLEARS WE SEE THROUGH DIESEL SMOKE: A BUSING PROTEST IN PROGRESS. THE SCHOOL-BUS, FULL OF BLACK KIDS, IS HIT WITH BRICKS, ROCKS. N.B.: (THIS IS NOT SETTING THE LIVE ACTION IN 1974; IT IS A HISTORICAL MONTAGE, THE BACKGROUND FOR COSTELLO'S V.O.).

INT. THE AUTOBODY SHOP. DAY.

COSTELLO's profile passes in a dark room.

COSTELLO (V.O.)
Years ago, we had the Church. That was only a way of saying we had each other. The Knights of Columbus were head-breakers. They took over their piece of the city.

EXT. SOUTHIE. VARIOUS

The neighborhood. 1980's. We won't be here long. This isn't where Costello ends up. It's where he began. Liquor stores with shamrocked signs. MEN FISHING near Castle Island. Catholic SCHOOLKIDS playing in an asphalted schoolyard.

COSTELLO (V.O.)
Twenty years after an Irishman
couldn't get a job, we had the
presidency. That’s what the niggers
don’t realize. If I got one thing
against the black chaps it's this.
No one gives it to you. You have to
take it.

INT. LUNCH COUNTER. DAY

COSTELLO comes in. The shop is one that sells papers, sundries, fountain drinks...and fronts a bookie operation.

YOUNG COSTELLO
(leaning over cluttered
counter)
Don’t make me have to come down

here again.

CONTINUED:


PROPRIETOR
Won’t happen again, Mr. C.

The frightened proprietor hands over money. Fifty bucks, a hundred, doesn’t matter. COSTELLO is never the threatener. His demeanor is gentle, philosophical. Almost a shrink’s probing bedside manner. He has great interest in the world as he moves through it. As if he originally came from a different world and his survival in this one depends on close continual observation and analysis.

YOUNG COLIN looks up. CLOSE ON his eyes. He is fourteen or fifteen, but small for his age. Bookish.

COSTELLO eyes the proprietor’s TEENAGE DAUGHTER, working behind the counter. He takes a propane lighter, and, strangely, pays for it (the proprietor startled) and waits for change. He lights a MORE cigarette with the lighter.

YOUNG COSTELLO
Carmen’s developing into a fine
young lady. You should be proud.

You get your period yet, Carmen?

The PROPRIETOR is uneasy. COSTELLO turns to YOUNG COLIN (about 14) staring at the local hero. Costello reaches up above and behind the counter and takes down some cigarettes.

YOUNG COSTELLO (CONT’D)
You Johnny Sullivan’s kid?

COLIN nods.

YOUNG COSTELLO (CONT'D)
You live with your grandmother?

COLIN nods.

YOUNG COLIN
Yeah.

COSTELLO tells the Proprietor to takes three loaves of bread and some soup off the shelves and puts them in Colin’s bag.

COSTELLO
Get him three loaves of bread. And a couple of half gallons of milk. And some soup.

He goes over to the fridge and puts two half gallons of milk in the bag. Some soup. Costello turns to Colin.

CONTINUED: (2)


COSTELLO (CONT'D)
Do you like comic books?

Colin nods.	He adds a couple of comic books.

When the PROPRIETOR looks at him, he takes out the money he put in his pocket and gives back half.

YOUNG COSTELLO
You do good in school?

YOUNG COLIN nods, holding the big bag of loot.

COLIN
Yes.

YOUNG COSTELLO
That’s good. I did good in school.

They call that a paradox.

He gives some money to Carmen.

YOUNG COSTELLO (CONT'D) Buy yourself some makeup. Keep the change.

Looks intently at COLIN to see if he gets it.	Colin does.

YOUNG COSTELLO (CONT’D) You ever want to earn a little extra money, you come by L street. You know where I am on L street.

COLIN nods: everybody does.

YOUNG COLIN
Thank you.

He pushes out with the bags of groceries.

The PROPRIETOR can do shit about it.

YOUNG COSTELLO watches YOUNG COLIN go off down a slummy street.

INT. A CHURCH. MORNING. 1985-ISH

YOUNG COLIN, the good boy, the very good boy, is serving at a funeral Mass. Various views of the church. Stained-glass light. The altar is still wreathed in the smoke of incense.
 






 
4.

CONTINUED:


PRIEST (V.O.)
To you, O Lord we commend the soul of Alphonsus, your Servant; in the sight of this world he is now dead; in your sight may he live forever. Forgive whatever sins he committed through human weakness and in your goodness grant him everlasting peace.

ALL
Amen.

CLOSE on COLIN'S face.

PRIEST (VO)
May the angels lead you into
paradise; May the martyrs come to
welcome you and take you to the
holy city, The new and eternal

Jerusalem.

A liturgical bell tings.

INT. THE AUTOBODY SHOP. DAY

COSTELLO is talking informally (we realize that this is a continuation of the philosophical talk, the shadowy pacing). YOUNG KIDS. Useful young men. YOUNG COLIN, three years older, is among them.

YOUNG COSTELLO
Church wants you in your place.
What sort of man wants to be kept
in his place? Do this don't do
that, kneel, stand, kneel,
stand...I mean if you go for that
sort of thing...

YOUNG COLIN, the recent altar boy, visibly doesn't go for that sort of thing.

YOUNG COSTELLO (CONT'D) I don't know what to do for you. A man makes his own way. No one gives it to you. You have to take it.
(a beat)

Non serviam.

YOUNG COLIN
James Joyce.

CONTINUED:


YOUNG COSTELLO
Him and Lucifer. And me.
(to the room)

Guineas from the North End and down Providence, tried to tell me what to do...And something maybe happened to them.

EXT. A REMOTE BEACH. DAWN

Rose-colored dawn. YOUNG COSTELLO, with a pistol, executes a MAN kneeling in the surf. She falls on the body of a man who has just been executed.

COSTELLO
Jeez, she fell funny.

FRENCH moves forward with an axe in his hand.

FRENCH
Frank, you gotta see somebody.

They go about their business.

INT. THE AUTOBODY SHOP. DAY

YOUNG COSTELLO walking, talking...Not continuous with the above. We see that only YOUNG COLIN is present.

YOUNG COSTELLO
You decide to be something, you can be it. That's what they don't tell you, the Church.

MISTER FRENCH is doing books off behind a window of dirty glass.

YOUNG COSTELLO (CONT'D) When I was your age, they would say, we become cops or criminals. Today, what I'm saying to you is this: When you are facing a loaded gun...

very close on COSTELLO, holding Colin's shoulder.

YOUNG COSTELLO (CONT'D)
What's the difference?

ECU: COLIN’S EYES swerve up. We are now on (MATURE) COLIN’S EYES eyes. This is how the character transits the “age leap”...on the unchanging eyes.
 
6.



THE SAME EYES.

Pull back to reveal:

POLICE TRAINEES. (INCLUDING BARRIGAN, who is included in all Colin's trainee scenes). COLIN is in the class, wearing a trainee's uniform. He has a notebook, a pen. Writing.

INSTRUCTOR
The slug enters the skull by forming a small entrance hole. Blood and brain matter is ejected backwards from this hole. The bullet, which may expand, fragment or tumble, then passes through the brain...

COLIN writes.

INT. FIRING RANGE. DAY

POLICE TRAINEES ON A FIRING RANGE. As we go along the line we see COLIN, firing dry and then speed-changing a clip in a BERETTA 92F. He is a perfect trainee.

EXT. A TRAINING FIELD. DAY

STATE POLICE TRAINEES standing in a pissing rain, a DI yelling at them OS. COLIN is staring forward. RAIN streaming down his face. His opinion on the experience is not decipherable. Ad libs: "Sir, yes, sir."

EXT. THE BOSTON COMMON. DAY

Guys we recognize from the previous shots at the State Police Academy (wearing Statie t-shirts), including COLIN and BARRIGAN, are playing rugby against some FIREFIGHTERS. Very rough game. The game breaks up with each group giving each other the finger. FIREFIGHTERS are moving away triumphantly.

COLIN
Fucking firemen are getting pussy
for the first time in the history

of fire. Or pussy.

COLIN sits on a bench looking at THE GOLD DOME OF BEACON HILL. The terraces of fine townhouses. Aqueous golden light behind. Misty golden beauty.
 








 
7.

CONTINUED:


BARRIGAN
What are you looking at? Forget it. Your father was a janitor, and his son's only a cop.

COLIN
(not vainglorious, but
innocently stretching for
the idea)
You're in trouble if you're "only"

anything.

BARRIGAN
Don't tell me I'm looking at the
first dickhead-American president

of the United States.

COLIN doesn't have a great sense of humor but he knows how to pretend that he does. He smiles.

EXT. STATE POLICE GRADUATION CEREMONY. DAY

Bagpipes and bullshit. Flags cracking. Line after line of paramilitary-looking graduates, among them COLIN.

SPEAKER (V.O.)
The Massachusetts State Police has a long tradition of excellence. Your graduation today solidifies your acceptance into one of the finest law enforcement agencies in our nation. As the Governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, I am confident each and every one of you will serve with distinction, honor and integrity.

CAMERA swirls around COLIN as he moves, a lone person, through the breaking up crowd. Other graduates are hugged by family. COLIN, alone, comes to the gates of the yard.

THE MAYOR VO
Congratulations. You are dismissed.

The bagpipe band plays "Minstrel Boy."

COLIN'S POV:

AN OLDSMOBILE. COSTELLO and MISTER FRENCH standing by the car.
 






 
8.

CONTINUED:


COLIN walks over to the car. COSTELLO gives COLIN a BOX. COLIN flips open the top and then quickly closes it. NOTE: The box could contain an eyeball, money, drugs, a picture of Colin fucking his school teacher...we will never know.

COSTELLO
School’s out. You earned it. Yeah, no more teachers, no more books.

INT. AN EXAMINATION ROOM. DAY

TITLE: FOUR YEARS LATER

A test is reversed on a desk lit with fluorescents. BILLY takes up a Number Two pencil. He is in a room full of trainees, far enough along in their traineeship that their hair has grown in.

A CLOCK TICKS, sweep hand coming around.

BILLY'S EYES on it.

INSTRUCTOR (O.S.)
Begin.

BILLY takes the test, marking multiple choice answers swiftly while all around him trainees are sweating and still trying to read the questions.

EXT. A TRACK. DAY

BILLY, wearing a State Police sweatshirt is running, alongside BROWN a black trainee with specs.

BROWN
She tells me, you never finish
anything.
(puff puff)
You finish the police course you
get taken care of again baby.
(puff puff)
So after graduation
(puff puff)

I get a blowjob again.

BILLY
That's great. Your mom must be a

wonderful woman.

BROWN
Fuck yourself.
 





 
9.

CONTINUED:


BILLY
Look at it this way, you're a black guy in Boston. You don't need any help from me to be completely fucked.

BROWN
Ways to get ahead, though, man,

ways to get ahead.

BILLY
(exasperated by this)

To where. (Yeah)

BROWN is left thinking about this.

EXT. TRAINING FIELD. DAY

BILLY with other trainees is being braced by a DI.

DRILL INSTRUCTOR
This is not the regular police.
This is the state police. Your
training will illustrate the

difference. What's the difference?

BILLY
(sotto voce to BROWN)

Rage issues and lower median IQ.

DRILL INSTRUCTOR
You say something?

BILLY
Sir, I was agreeing with you about our obvious superiority to other forms of police, sir.

DRILL INSTRUCTOR
We're not superior, we're the best.

BILLY
Sir, yes sir.

INT. FIRING RANGE. DAY

BILLY, in glasses and ear-protectors, waiting for the target. Go from the GUN to
 
10.



INT. A CRACKHOUSE. DAY.

COLIN, four years a veteran of the gang unit, is on the job, on a raid, clearing rooms, part of a team working with massive aggression. He moves through a door. A SAD SACK OF SHIT is throwing drugs out a window.

COLIN
(calling to other cops)

Douchebag!

COPS enter past Colin and pigpile the man. COLIN is chewing gum, all testosterone and aggression, glad to be a cop. The smartest guy in the room.

EXT. FIRING RANGE. DAY

BILLY fires, and changes clips.

EXT. A STREET IN BOSTON. DAY

A BLACK-WINDOWED, MODERN, POLICE BUILDING, beetling over a plaza. Older Boston reflected in the featureless glass. The Boston of this film is almost futuristic. COLIN looks up at the building with great intensity. He puts on his sunglasses and walks towards the door.

INT. QUEENAN'S OFFICE. DAY

COLIN, in civvies (a very good suit), stands at suave attention before CAPTAIN QUEENAN, a mild and scholarly man who might as well be a Jesuit history-teacher.

QUEENAN
Congratulations on passing the
detective exam, and welcome to the

Special Investigation Unit.

DIGNAM
(tonelessly)

Whoop-di fuckin’ do.

QUEENAN
We won't be working directly together, you'll be working for Captain Ellerby, but I like to see everybody.
(contemplating him)
You're a worker, you rise fast.
 







 
11.

CONTINUED:


DIGNAM
Like a twelve year old's dick.

(Alt: Like a turd in the pool.)

COLIN
Thank you, Sergeant.

DIGNAM
My pleasure.

COLIN
(to Queenan)

Thank you, sir.

He turns to go.

INT. QUEENAN'S OFFICE WAITING ROOM. DAY

As COLIN leaves the office, looking very satisfied and not a little saturnine (it's not as if he isn't pleased by recognition and it's not as if he won't get revenge on Dignam), he barely glances--and does not actually see--the TRAINEE sitting off to one side. He sees polished brogues, and walks on.

QUEENAN'S SECRETARY
(whispering, joyful, in
love with COLIN)

Congratulations.

COLIN
Thanks, hon.

As COLIN leaves she moderates her expression and:

QUEENAN'S SECRETARY
(coldly)

You can go in there now.

BILLY looks up. He has not seen COLIN, and COLIN has not seen him. He has his interview on his mind.

INT. QUEENAN'S OFFICE. MOMENTS LATER

BILLY stands at attention. The picture of a spit-and-polish trainee.

QUEENAN
You can sit.

BILLY does.
 





 
12.

CONTINUED:


QUEENAN (CONT'D)
So.

BILLY has no idea why he is in this room with the brass. Sgt. Dignam is staring at him aggressively, with contempt, stirring his coffee. DIGNAM is more intelligent than he seems.

QUEENAN (CONT'D)
Do you know what we do here?	My
section?

BILLY doesn’t want to answer unless he can answer correctly.

BILLY
Sir, yes, sir, I have an idea...

SGT. DIGNAM
Whoa, let’s say you have no idea and leave it there. No idea. Zip, none. If you had an idea about what we do we would not be good at what we do. We would be cunts. Are you calling us cunts?

BILLY wouldn't normally take crap from this guy; but he does. He's openly intrigued by the situation. Dignam is staring at him. BILLY looks evenly at QUEENAN.

QUEENAN
(not looking up from
papers)

Staff Sergeant Dignam has a style of his own. I'm afraid we all have to deal with it.

SGT. DIGNAM
(getting to business,
hard)

You have family connections down in Southie. Through your father. Tell us about your uncle Jackie.

BILLY
Uncle Jackie was a carpet layer for

Jordan Marsh.

SGT. DIGNAM
Uncle Jackie was a small-time
bookie who tended bar at the Vets
in Somerville.

SGT. DIGNAM (CONT'D)
He got popped by Nicastro in '95.
They found his body out by the

airport.

BILLY says slowly:

BILLY
That's right.
(tightly)

I remember his funeral.

SGT. DIGNAM
(cruelly)

Closed casket?

BILLY
That's right.

SGT. DIGNAM
You tell anybody at Deerfield - that is, before you got kicked out for whaling on a gym teacher with a folding chair - you had an uncle met his demise like that?

BILLY says nothing. Eyes luminous.

SGT. DIGNAM (CONT'D)
I got a question. How fucked up are you?

INT. CORRIDOR POLICE BUILDING. DAY

COLIN, in his good suit, moves along the hall. He owns the building. He looks into offices. He is looking at his future. From one room BARRIGAN (still working in uniform) gives him the thumbs up. COLIN gets a coffee. He looks at a secretary's ass. Caught at it, he smiles beautifully. She smiles back.

BARRIGAN
What you got?
(with admiration and envy)
"Staff Sergeant". In four years

you're a sergeant.

COLIN
SIU. What a country.

BARRIGAN
(after a beat)

Perfect.
 






 
14.

CONTINUED:


Meaning to some extent "Perfect for a dick like you". This is how friends come apart. BARRIGAN is unable to continue his pose of congratulation. COLIN (close on Colin) is on to him.

COLIN
I don't mind going it alone. If you could go it alone you might get somewhere yourself.

BARRIGAN
We're cops. This isn't "somewhere".

COLIN
I know you're a worker. I might be able to do something for you. You got any suits at home or you like coming to work looking like you're gonna invade Poland.

INT. QUEENAN'S OFFICE. DAY

BILLY is still at attention. DIGNAM going with wet thumb through papers.

SGT. DIGNAM
Let's look at the rest of the family tree. Your maggot uncle Tommy Costigan--he's another goof-- got busted selling guns to federal officers. Among many, many, many other departures from, ah, "normative behavior".

QUEENAN is inspecting Billy, watching his reactions. Specs catching light.

BILLY
What's this got to do with me?

SGT. DIGNAM
Why are you pretending to be a cop?

INT. OCS CONFERENCE ROOM. CONTINUOUS

COLIN is eyeing a woman COP across the table. She smiles at him and lowers her eyes. At the end of the table:

ELLERBY
This unit is new, and you are the newest members of it. You have been selected for it on the basis of intelligence and aptitude.

ELLERBY (CONT'D)
This is an elite unit. Our job is
to smash--or at least marginally
disrupt--
(he gets the laugh he
expected)
--organized crime in this city by
our own efforts and by enhanced
cooperation with the FBI,
represented here by Agent Frank
Lazio--
(show the deeply
unreliable dandy LAZIO)
and we will do it. And by organized crime in this city...you know who we mean.

SURVEILLANCE PHOTOS come up. COSTELLO in sunglasses standing in front of the Autobody shop. COSTELLO standing with UNCLE JACKIE COSTIGAN.

ELLERBY (CONT'D)
(clicking the button)

That's Jackie Costigan...that's an old picture. Jackie met his demise.

PHOTO OF JACKIE'S DEMISE: PHOTO OF JACKIE, DEAD.

ELLERBY (CONT'D)
Last known photograph.

MORE RECENT PHOTOS. FITZY, DELAHUNT, FRENCH, all photographed with COSTELLO. Coming out of buildings, talking on the street, getting into cars.

ELLERBY (CONT'D)
Costello uses three key guys.
There's Fitzy...off the boat
psycho...lives in Brockton with his
mother who looks like she's
straight out of "Going My Way"...
There's Delahunt, muscle, and here’s French...the number one. But of course the rock star is...[you know who]

A picture of COSTELLO comes up. COLIN looks at it. In the MUG SHOT Costello is serene, untouchable legally, untouchable at the heart. He's like a hilarious devil.

ELLERBY (CONT'D)
We've done a briefing book. Read
up.

16.

ELLERBY (CONT'D)
I want to have any and all ideas,
so I can pass them off as my own.

(laughter, a long beat) Do your jobs and you will rise fast. You’re in the best position in the department. Let's go to work.

The recruits disperse into a glittering modern office. COLIN, in his flash suit, gets a cup of coffee. He looks at the BRIEFING BOOK. He opens to a picture of COSTELLO.

INT. QUEENAN'S OFFICE. DAY

DIGNAM still working Billy.

DIGNAM
Your old man was a hump from
Southie. Baggage-handler at the
airport. Family's all criminals

except your old man.

BILLY
And one priest. Since you seem to

know everything.

DIGNAM
I ain't sure about him, either. (ALT: Last I heard he was happily married to a 12 year old boy and living on a beach in Thailand.) Family's dug into the Southie projects like ticks. Lifers down there. Three decker men at best. You grew up, however, up the North shore. La di (fuckin') da.

Dignam leans over Billy.

DIGNAM (CONT'D)
You were kind of a double kid, I bet, right? One kid with your old man. One kid with your mother. Upper middle class in the week, and then dropping your 'r's and hanging in the Southie projects with daddy the donkey on the weekends. I got that right?

BILLY, opened up expertly and crudely, stares with contained hatred.
 






 
17.

CONTINUED:


SGT. DIGNAM
You have different accents? You did, didn't you. (You little fuckin' snake.) You were different fuckin’ people.

BILLY
You a psychiatrist?

SGT. DIGNAM
If I was I'd ask you why you're a Statie making thirty grand a year. And I think if I were Sigmund fucking Freud himself I wouldn't get an answer. So tell me, what's a lace curtain motherfucker like you doing in the Staties?

BILLY
Well. Families are always rising or falling in America. Am I right?

QUEENAN
(appreciative, kindly,
looking up from his
papers)

Who said that?

BILLY
Hawthorne.

SGT. DIGNAM (although he knows perfectly well who Hawthorne is) makes a fart-noise with his mouth. BILLY looks at him with an "I'm going to kill you" expression which is not without wit and which Dignam seems to admire.

DIGNAM
What’s the matter, smartass? You don’t know any fuckin’ Shakespeare?

QUEENAN
We have a question. You want to be a cop, or do you want to appear to be a cop. It's an honest question. Lot of guys want to appear to be cops. Gun. Badge. Pretend they're on TV...

SGT. DIGNAM
A lot of em just want to slam a nigger’s head through a plate glass window.

BILLY
I’m all set without your personal

job application, Sergeant.

DIGNAM
(after a "we got a live
one" glance at Queenan)
What the fuck did you say to me,

trainee?

BILLY looks at him, and then looks forward.

BILLY
Sir, with all due respect, sir,

what is it you want from me?

DIGNAM
Hey asshole, he can’t help you. I know what you are, and what you aren't. I'm the best friend you ever had on the face of the earth. I'm gonna help you understand something: You're no fuckin' cop.

QUEENAN
He's right.

(Billy looks at Queenan) We deal in deceptions here. But what we don’t deal with is self-deception. In five years, you might be anything else in the world, but you won't be a Massachusetts State trooper.

BILLY
You sure of that?

QUEENAN
I'm sure of that.

DIGNAM
Guaranteed.

QUEENAN
(looking up from his
papers)

You don't have much family.

CLOSE ON BILLY.
 







 
19.

CONTINUED: (3)


BILLY
(deciding this on the
spot)

I don't have any family.

EXT. HUNTINGTON AVENUE. LATE DAY

A TROLLEY goes past. HOSPITAL HILL, above the trolley line, is sinister, quiet. HOSPITAL at the top like a malign fortress, above rows of endlessly repeated condominiums. BILLY CROSSES from the Trolley stop, desperately, an angry young man at his life's turning point.

INT. A HOSPITAL ROOM. LATER

BILLY’S MOTHER lies as if floating in her bed. Tubes, lights. A bald head on a barely-dented pillow. She is a cancer patient in a coma, weighing possibly 80 lbs. Gasping for air. Her airways are cleared with a suction tube. BILLY sits watching as the tube goes in. BILLY sits looking at her.

EXT. THE HOSPITAL CORRIDOR. LATER

BILLY is leaning against a wall. A maternal WASP UNCLE, a not-bright guy (pretensions, rather than status), speaks briefly to a DOCTOR further along the hall, then approaches BILLY, hands in the pocket of a good suit.

WASP UNCLE
What's this I hear from Stephanie

about you becoming a policeman?

BILLY
You mean Stephanie who was the only one who came to my father's funeral? That Stephanie?

UNCLE
That Stephanie.

BILLY
Nothing much to it Uncle Edward.

UNCLE
Are you trying to prove something

to the family?

BILLY
When you say "family", what do you mean? You?
 






 
20.

CONTINUED:


UNCLE
You always question everything,

don't you?

BILLY
Yeah, well, maybe it would have done you some good to have a question from time to time. "Am I an asshole?" "Are my kids a mess?" "Is my wife a money-grubbing whore?" Those are questions.
(the UNCLE starts to
leave)
"Have I been good to my dying
sister or am I just pretending to
be?"
(he's stung THE UNCLE)

Too late now, right?

UNCLE
Do you need some money for the

funeral?

THE UNCLE moves away, bends to get his overcoat.

BILLY
When my mother dies we don't have

any connection. You got it?

EXT. BOSTON. TWILIGHT

AERIAL. FLY FROM the HOSPITAL TO:

THE GOLD DOME ON BEACON HILL

INT. AN APARTMENT ON BEACON HILL. TWILIGHT

A REALTOR switches on lights. An empty, flash apartment above the Parisian rooftops of Beacon Hill. A view of the Dome. More than you'd think a cop could afford. We see, as COLIN does, beyond his reflection in the glass, the STATE HOUSE DOME.

REALTOR
This is it. Nice. You've got high ceilings, parquet floors. There's a lock on the fridge in case you have eating issues.... Joke...not a very good one.
(uneasy)
So, you're a policeman?
 





 
21.

CONTINUED:


COLIN
(like something he is used
to reciting)

I'm a State Police detective.

REALTOR
(wondering where he gets
his money from)
State Police Detective. You a

married State Police Detective?

COLIN
(coming out of his reverie
and coldly:)

...No.

REALTOR
Oh, cuz it's big and I wondered if a cop...

COLIN
I have a cosigner.

REALTOR
You intend to have a housemate.

That's cool.

COLIN
Give me the fuckin' papers.

EXT. HOSPITAL HILL OVERLOOK. NIGHT

BILLY sits on a bench looking out over the whole city. (It is the best view of Boston, never seen in a film). He’s smoking a cigarette, making his decision.

INT. QUEENAN'S OFFICE.	DAY

Continuation of the interview.

BILLY
So what do I do?

QUEENAN
During the war, Churchill used river mines. He'd float them down the rivers into Germany. They'd either hit something, or not. That's what we’ll use you for. I'll float you down the river. The rest will happen. Or it won't...

22.

CONTINUED:
QUEENAN (CONT'D)

By the way, this isn't police work for peanuts. There's money behind this operation. You won't be paid as a cop, but there is a bonus involved. Tax free.

QUEENAN writes on a slip of paper and hands it to BILLY.
BILLY looks up from the paper, impressed.

DIGNAM
Luck of the Irish. All that and
you're still young enough to fuck

undergraduates.

QUEENAN
We can't conceal that you've been a trainee. You'll be convicted of a crime. We're thinking that a guilty plea to assault and battery might make sense.

DIGNAM
Given your nature.

QUEENAN
You'll serve enough jail time to
convince anyone that it's no set-
up. You'll be on probation. The

whole nine yards.

DIGNAM
I need you, pal. You've already
pretended to be a Costigan from

South Boston.

BILLY looks up with a glazed insolence. In one beat he is not a scared trainee but a smart criminal.

BILLY
Every weekend...Sergeant.

DIGNAM
Perfect.

QUEENAN
Do it again. For me.

EXT. HOSPITAL HILL OVERLOOK. NIGHT

BILLY throws down his cigarette. He has decided.

FILM TITLE:	THE DEPARTED
 
23.



EXT. CEMETERY. DAY

Priest's cassock whipping in the wind. A few mourners (shabby genteel ladies, contemporaries of his mother), but Billy seems to have no real connection with any of them.

LATER

BILLY is alone at the grave. He looks at the tags on wind-blown wreaths. One gives him pause. Under a picture of The Virgin it reads: "Heaven holds the Faithful Departed" and is signed: "F. Costello".

INT. JAIL HOLDING TANK. DAY

A CELL DOOR CLOSES. On Billy. Looking like a real criminal. Not a pretend one. Frightened and resolute at once. BILLY is in a holding tank.

EXT. THE BALCONY OF COLIN'S APARTMENT. MORNING

COLIN, in a bathrobe, leans on the rail and looks at Boston. THE GOLD DOME visible. Colin drinks coffee. Not satisfied: worried.

INT. A PROCESSING FACILITY. DAY

BILLY, naked, holds his clothes in a bundle. Being processed out of jail. Beside him another guy, furtive, gruff, not trying to be friendly.

OTHER PRISONER
You're Bill Costigan?

BILLY
Who wants to know?

OTHER PRISONER
Nothin.' I know a Sean Costigan. L

Street.

BILLY
My cousin.

OTHER PRISONER
Connected but not too bright--
(BILLY looks at him with
an only-I-can-insult-my-
cousin look)

No offense.

Billy gets his clothes.
 
24.



INT. CONFERENCE ROOM. DAY

On the wall is a rogues gallery of COSTELLO and all his primary guys...MISTER FRENCH, DELAHUNT, FITZY. COLIN and others sitting listening. COLIN, reading a paper (Boston Herald) which may or may not have the headline, CASE DROPPED AGAINST DRUGS CADET (featuring a picture of Billy), looks up as SGT. DIGNAM comes in.

SGT. DIGNAM
Sorry I'm late.

ELLERBY
Staff Sergeant Dignam is our liaison with the undercover section. Their undercover work is extensive. He's here to give us his report. Sgt. Dignam.

SGT. DIGNAM
OK. They're out there, my people. They're like the fuckin' Indians. You're not gonna see them. You're not gonna hear about them except through me or Captain Queenan. You will not, ever, know the identity of undercover people. This shit hole, unfortunately, has more fuckin' leaks than the Iraqi navy.

ELLERBY
Fuck yourself.

SGT. DIGNAM
I'm tired from fucking your wife.

ELLERBY
How's your mother?

SGT. DIGNAM
Good. She's tired from fucking my
father.
(opens a FILE)
OK, today, girls, what I got for

you is microprocessors.

LAZIO, the Fed, comes in and sits down. With folders, pencil.
 










 
25.

CONTINUED:


SGT. DIGNAM (CONT'D) Somebody, as you may already know, stole one hundred microprocessors from the Mass Processor Corp out Route 128. They're the kind of processors they put into computers that can put a cruise missile up the ass of a camel from the other side of the planet. That's what they do out there on "America's Technology Highway". Worth a hundred grand apiece. Guy worked for the company two months walked out the door with a box of processors on Tuesday, has a ticket booked for Florida on Wednesday, but on Thursday he gets found in a dumpster. You know where this dirt ball started his life? Southie projects.

COLIN
What was his name? The, ah,

departed.

SGT. DIGNAM
Myles Kennefick. Got the job with a forged UMass transcript. UMass Boston, which incidentally happens to be in...

LAZIO
South Boston?

SGT. DIGNAM
Who forged your transcript,

dickhead?

COLIN
I know that guy. His father runs
the Hibernian Liquor Mart.

Kennefick's.

ELLERBY
We are not here to solve the "Case of the Dead Scumbag". We are here to nail Costello.

COLIN stands down, embarrassed.
 







 
26.

CONTINUED: (2)


SGT. DIGNAM
We got a guy says that he hears Costello is moving the processors to China...that he set up the whole fuckin' job and popped Kennefick.
(LAZIO is writing,
lawyerish.)
You don't want to miss it if

Costello takes a dump.

ELLERBY
We'd miss less if your informants were available to us, and of course to the FBI (Bureau)...

LAZIO
Without asking for details, do you have anyone in with Costello presently?

SGT. DIGNAM
Maybe. Maybe not. Maybe fuck
yourself. My theory on Feds is
they're like mushrooms. Feed 'em
shit and keep in the dark. You

girls have a nice day.

EXT. A STREET OF TENEMENTS IN SOUTHIE. DAY

BILLY steps off a bus at a corner. He goes up to a house, and knocks on the door. A Southie hag answers. On an oxygen cylinder, smoking.

BILLY'S AUNT
Billy?

BILLY nods.

BILLY
Aunt Cathy?

His aunt takes her cigarette out of her mouth and then embraces him fiercely. BILLY takes it like the imposter he is. But he might well love his aunt.

BILLY'S AUNT
Good to see you. Good to see you.

INT. BILLY'S AUNT'S KITCHEN. DAY

BILLY is eating soup.
 





 
27.

CONTINUED:


BILLY'S AUNT
They said you were in the Staties,

I couldn't believe it.

BILLY
I got kicked out about four months ago.

SEAN
It was in the papers.

Sean is a villain leaning in a doorway. Bad tie: he takes it off. He has been at a funeral.

BILLY
Well. So you know.

SEAN
And why are we graced with your

presence?

BILLY
I brought your mother some pictures of my father.

It's true. They are on the table.

BILLY (CONT'D)
My mother had them. My mother's

dead.

SEAN
(reflexively)
I'm sorry. I'm sorry for your

troubles.

Sean opens the fridge, opens a beer, and hands it to BILLY.
He opens one for himself.

SEAN (CONT'D)
I was at a funeral myself. Myles Kennefick, knew him in school. Beat the fuck out of him seven or eight times as a matter of fact.
(affably to Billy)
You workin'?

BILLY
No.
 
28.



EXT. THE PORCH OF THE THREE-DECKER. LATER

Sean and BILLY are still drinking beer.

SEAN
When did I see you after that?

BILLY
Not for a long time. Down the cape after Rose's wedding. I think.

SEAN
Fuck, oh shit. I remember that,
dude. I had that fuckin' buck
knife, right, and I cut all the
brass numbas off the doors at the
hotel. I was trippin'...All of
them. That was a night.

Sean looks deflated.

BILLY
Listen, I got twenty thousand
dollars when my mother died.

Insurance.

SEAN
Yeah?

BILLY
In your line of work, if I gave you ten thousand dollars what could you give me back?

SEAN
My line of work... I'm not in that line of work just presently because I don't have ten thousand dollars. As a matter of fact I have never had ten thousand dollars.

BILLY
That's what I'm saying.

Sean nods, and nods.

SEAN
You know what we usually say at

these moments.
 







 
29.

CONTINUED:


BILLY
You fuckin' moron. What are you
talking about? I'm not a cop. I'm

your cousin.

INT. BILLY'S CAR. NIGHT

BILLY is waiting. Sean comes out of a squalid looking house and gets into a car. Fast. Billy puts the car in gear.

SEAN
Fuckin' Ricans think they know everything. If they knew shit they wouldn't be Puerto Ricans.

He has a paper bag full of money. He opens a beer.

SEAN (CONT'D)
(high as a kite)
Double the money, double the fun.
(confusing his TV jingles)
Cinnamon toasty apple bun... R is

for Ricans...P is for pigs...

They drive past a BPD cruiser. Sean hides his beer.

SEAN (CONT'D)
I can't stop drinkin.

BILLY laughs.

BILLY
Why would you even think of

stopping drinking?

SEAN
He don't like it. He don't like drinkin...he don't like fightin...
(Sean looks sad)
...he says stay out of the bars... You know, we’re not even supposed to do this on this side of fuckin’ Worcester.

BILLY
Who says?

SEAN
He says. Costello says. God says,

as far as you’re concerned.
 
30.



INT. A HORRIBLE BAR IN SOUTHIE. NIGHT

Sean, beyond wasted, is talking to some people, including MISTER FRENCH. A table wet with spilled beer.

SEAN
Not a cop. He got out of the joint three weeks ago. Dead up. He talks like his shit don't stink but he's good people.

VILLAIN
Cunt cop.

MISTER FRENCH
I knew his father. I liked his

uncle Jackie better.

SEAN
Uncle Jackie was excellent.

AN IRISH VILLAIN
Fucking guineas.

They solemnly toast uncle Jackie and his fate among the fucking guineas. Across the crowded room, BILLY is ordering at the bar.

BILLY
A cranberry juice.

WELL-DRESSED SCUMBAG AT BAR It's a natural diuretic. My girlfriend drinks it when she got her period.
(to BILLY)

You got your period?

BILLY glances over at the table where MISTER FRENCH sits with SEAN, and then smashes his glass into the face of the WELL DRESSED SCUMBAG. He stands waiting for the SCUMBAG to get up he is grabbed and shoved against the wall by MISTER FRENCH. Popped into a pay phone hard. The pay phone comes off the hook.

BILLY
Get your hands off me.

MISTER FRENCH
Do you know me?
 






 
31.

CONTINUED:


BILLY
No.

BILLY shakes his head no.

MISTER FRENCH
I'm the guy who tells you there are guys you hit and there are guys you don't. That's not quite a guy you can't hit, but it's almost a guy you can't hit, so I'm fucking ruling on it right now that you don't hit him, understand?

BILLY
Yeah. Excellent. Fine.

MISTER FRENCH
I know you. I know your family. Also I know you do another drug deal with your idiot fucking cop-magnet cousin I'll forget your grandmother was very nice to me and cut your fucking nuts off. You understand that?

BILLY
Yeah.

MISTER FRENCH
Now you know me.

BILLY
Yeah.

A beat: they stare at each other.

MISTER FRENCH
What are you drinking?

BILLY
Cranberry juice.

A beat.

MISTER FRENCH
What is it, your period?

BILLY laughs.

MISTER FRENCH (CONT'D)
Get him a cranberry juice.
 




 
32.

CONTINUED: (2)


The WELL-DRESSED SCUMBAG is bleeding, incredulous. MISTER FRENCH takes him by the shoulder.

MISTER FRENCH (CONT'D)
(sotto voce to WELL-
DRESSED SCUMBAG)

That's Jackie's nephew.

WELL-DRESSED SCUMBAG
Oh...

MISTER FRENCH
Oh, what?

FRENCH demolishes him with body blows.

FRENCH
Get the fuck out of here.

EXT. A HOUSING PROJECT IN SOUTHIE. DAY

COLIN and BARRIGAN (who Colin has moved to plain clothes) stand at the door, talking, or trying to talk, with a fearful MRS KENNEFICK. MRS KENNEFICK looks like she starts drinking whiskey at 9 in the morning.

COLIN
Mrs. Kennefick, Myles and I were in school together. Myles was behind me in school but I knew him. I will get those responsible. Don't you want to see us catch whoever used him to do a robbery and then killed him?

MRS KENNEFICK
Allegedly.

COLIN
(grimaces)

"Allegedly".

MRS KENNEFICK
If he was killed he probably did

something wrong.

COLIN
You don't mean robbery do you, Mrs Kennefick? That’s not what you think he did wrong.

MRS. KENNEFICK notices COSTELLO driving by.
 
33.



INT. COSTELLO'S CAR. DAY.

Costello and Gwen are in the car. Gwen is dressed like Jackie O.

COSTELLO
Wave to your girlfriend.

EXT. A HOUSING PROJECT IN SOUTHIE. DAY.

MRS KENNEFICK
I mean fuck yourself.

She slams the door. As COLIN walks away from the door he notices the TAIL: a maroon sedan and a damaged white delivery van.

COLIN
You get that?

BARRIGAN
"Allegedly" or "fuck yourself?"

COLIN
Welcome to the neighborhood.

EXT. AN INTERSECTION. MOMENTS LATER

FRENCH pulls up to a light.

[COSTELLO blows a red light and leaves the tail (including the Surveillance Van which we will see again) behind him in a snarl of traffic.]

COSTELLO
Cut 'em here.

French steps on it and blows through the light, leaving the follow cars behind.

COSTELLO (CONT'D)
Bye, bye.

INT. THE ELEVATOR AT POLICE HEADQUARTERS. DAY

COLIN boards with a bunch of other cops and workers. On board, directly beside him, is MADOLYN. COLIN's age, beautiful, wearing a business suit. She has a thick stack of medical-looking files. She's a psychiatrist on contract to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. She does probation counselling work with "violent offenders" and also sees policemen.
