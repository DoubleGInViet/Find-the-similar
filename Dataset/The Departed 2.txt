COLIN
Making a house call?

MADOLYN
Have I seen you professionally?

COLIN
No, no. I know what you do. I know who you are.

MADOLYN nods, and then because this is a (relatively) sensitive subject ignores COLIN, but she is visibly attracted by him.

COLIN (CONT'D)
When guys have to "use their
"service revolvers" in the "course
of duty" they get to talk to you

about their "feelings" and whatnot.

MADOLYN laughs.

COLIN (CONT'D)
No. Oh, I know how it goes. You're a mental health professional.

MADOLYN
(laughing)
I have an appointment on this

floor.

The door opens.

COLIN
That's good. They're all fuckin'
crazy on that floor.
(points up)

I'm one floor up.

MADOLYN
Oh, fancy policeman.

COLIN
That's right. Fancy.

MADOLYN
Are you a Statie?

After she steps out he prevents the door from closing.

COLIN
Yeah, I'm also getting my law

degree.

MADOLYN
Suffolk, nights?

COLIN
They don't run Harvard Law at

night, last time I checked.

MADOLYN
When was the last time you checked?

COLIN
Before I went to fucking Suffolk.

MADOLYN
I went to U Mass.	I wasn't
insulting you.

COLIN
Well I thought you were, and for that you have to take me to dinner.

MADOLYN
Maybe you could shoot someone and

I'd have to see you professionally.

COLIN
Whatever it takes. I'll stab
someone in the heart with an
icepick right now if it gets me

dinner with you.

MADOLYN hands him a card.

COLIN (CONT'D)
I don't need a card, I'm a

detective.

She hesitates. He takes the card.

COLIN (CONT'D)
I'm only joking. Nice to meet

you... "Madolyn".

The doors close. The elevator takes him up. He takes out his cellphone as if he's forgotten something. As the doors open, the signal bars light up, and the phone rings.

COLIN (CONT'D)
(walking, voice low)

I didn't know about your tail until I saw it myself. I couldn't call, I had the other guy with me. Blue sedan and a white delivery van, fucked up with graffiti on the side. The van is audio surveillance. OK, have a nice day.

INT. A COFFEE SHOP IN SOUTHIE. MORNING

The same shop in which YOUNG COSTELLO talked to YOUNG COLIN, all those years ago. Two ITALIANS are in the shop, talking hard to the Pakistani PROPRIETOR (SINGH). These are hard guys but they're not being threatening, just persistent: the guy DOES owe them money. BILLY is finishing his breakfast. Watching. He goes over. The two GUINEAS are amazed. [Dialog on separate document].

Billy is finishing his breakfast. Watching. He goes over....

BILLY
You guys from Providence?

The GUINEAS look at him. The younger one moves to intervene. BILLY smiles and destroys them both. Maniacal violence. The biggest beatdown in gangster movie history--and obviously that's saying something. In the course of the beat-down Billy breaks his left hand--a "boxer's fracture". BILLY stands over his victims, breathing hard, holding his broken hand.

PROPRIETOR
What have you done to my place! Get out of here.

BILLY goes.

INT. EMERGENCY ROOM. NIGHT

BILLY, unlit cigarette in his mouth, is having his hand wrapped in plaster by a lady doctor. In another life he might have dated her. Not in this one.

INT. FRENCH RESTAURANT. NIGHT

A romantic restaurant. The best Boston has (which isn't saying much, but whatever). COLIN, looking great, a man on the rise. MADOLYN in pearls, also looking great. But maybe the conversation has lapsed and the date gone south.
 






 
37.




COLIN
You also do probation work, right?

MADOLYN
That's right. I see "violent

offenders".

COLIN
Bad guys.

MADOLYN
That's one way to look at it. Not necessarily.

COLIN wonders if she's breaking his balls. A DESSERT arrives: some towering Japanesey concoction with a fan of sugar candy spines, sitting in a pool of sauce. COLIN looks at it, fork poised. MADOLYN looks at it. He looks up at her.

COLIN
That have this and they don't have duck l'orange.

MADOLYN smiles: she likes him. Even with the dinner-long bitterness over the duck l'orange.

MADOLYN
Was your dinner OK?

COLIN
(holding balloon of
inappropriate wine)

Oh, the lobster was excellent. I just thought, French restaurant...

The look at the dessert.

MADOLYN
I'm waiting for you to make your

move.

COLIN
I don’t know what you’re gonna do, but if it moves I’m going to arrest it (shoot it).

MADOLYN laughs.	COLIN sees his shot: he’s got her laughing.
 










 
38.

 (2)


COLIN (CONT’D)
What’s it like having people “find themselves?” All day long people “finding themselves.” Does it get messy with all those feelings flying around the room?

MADOLYN
Why, does that make you

uncomfortable?

Colin stares at her.	Water glass nearly goes over.

MADOLYN (CONT'D)
You know what Freud said about the

Irish?

COLIN
Yes I do.

MADOLYN
If you actually do I'll see you

again.

COLIN
Who says I want to see you again?

MADOLYN
(concerned, perhaps
unexpectedly)

Don't you?

COLIN
Yes, course I do.
(a beat)

What Freud said about the Irish is We're the only people impervious to psychoanalysis.

MADOLYN is impressed.

COLIN (CONT'D)
Tough luck for you with a client
list of Mick cops, isn't it.

"Opening up"? Good luck to you.

COLIN laughs but looks nervous about the concept of "opening up".

COLIN (CONT'D)
Why do you do it?
 





 
39.

 (3)


MADOLYN
Some people do get better.

COLIN takes it seriously; admires it.

COLIN
Fair enough.

MADOLYN
Sometimes, though, I want people to forget about their personal bullshit and do their jobs.

Unsaid: Like I do.

COLIN
Including the criminals?

MADOLYN
If they don't do their jobs you

don't have one.

COLIN
Me? I'd just arrest innocent people. I'll arrest you right now.

MADOLYN
You're trouble.

COLIN
You don't know the half of it.

INT. A HORRIBLE BAR IN SOUTHIE. NIGHT

A slow night. BILLY IS AT THE BAR bent over a glass of cranberry juice. The women available are two CRONES. [Dialog on separate document]. Stark contrast to COLIN'S EVENING. A BOOKMAKER on the phone. BILLY, by the glances of people looking at him, has made his bones. He’s treated with respect. His hand and wrist in a cast. Out of nowhere (though Billy is aware conversation has stopped he does not look around)...

COSTELLO sits down beside him AT THE BAR.

BILLY observes:

MISTER FRENCH sitting down at a far table. Watching. Covering the room.

COSTELLO is brought a glass of water by the silent bartender.
No sound whatsoever in the bar.
 




 
40.




They say nothing, look at each other. BILLY notices DELAHUNT and FITZY, entering. They stand by MISTER FRENCH.

BILLY sits motionless.

COSTELLO
Do you know who I am?

BILLY does: but shakes his head.

BILLY
No.

COSTELLO
You met my friend, Mister French

the other night.

BILLY
Is his real name Mister French?

COSTELLO
No.
(a beat)
Come with me.
(As BILLY hesitates)
I’m not the cops. I’m not askin'
you.

BILLY stands up. MISTER FRENCH stands up. BILLY, COSTELLO, and MISTER FRENCH move towards the back room. As they walk to the back room of the bar, we hear COSTELLO:

COSTELLO (CONT'D)
You know something, they just do
not stop having the Mafia in
Providence, and this can cause

problems for me.

INT. BACK ROOM OF THE BAR. CONTINUOUS.

COSTELLO
Those guys you tuned up are connected down Providence. What they're going to do is come back up with some guys and kill you. Which, sure as you’re born, they will do unless I stop them. Do you want me to stop them?

BILLY
Is it something I can't do

personally?
 




 
41.




COSTELLO appreciates the balls of this. He looks at Mister French. Then back at Billy, smiling.

COSTELLO
I’m going to have my associate

search you.

BILLY tenses. Exactly as he might if he were wearing a wire.

BILLY
Search me? Search me for what?

MISTER FRENCH and COSTELLO look at each other.

MISTER FRENCH
C'm here.

COSTELLO
Contra-fucking-band.	Take your
fuckin' shoes off.

MISTER FRENCH
Shoes off.

BILLY slips out of them. MISTER FRENCH inspects the shoes. COSTELLO'S cold eyes are on BILLY. MISTER FRENCH searches BILLY. Looks into his wallet. The wallet is emptied onto a table.

COSTELLO
I knew your father.

BILLY
Yeah. He’s dead.

COSTELLO
I'm sorry.	How did he go?

BILLY
He didn’t complain.

COSTELLO
That was his problem.

BILLY
Who said he had a fuckin’ problem.

COSTELLO
I just said he had a fuckin’ problem. There’s a man could have been anything.
 





 
42.

 (2)


BILLY
Are you saying he was nothing?

COSTELLO
I’m saying he worked at the

airport.

COSTELLO turns to MISTER FRENCH.

MISTER FRENCH
He's clean.

COSTELLO
The arm.

With amazing violence MISTER FRENCH smashes the cast on the corner of a table. Billy drops to his knees in tears of pain. MISTER FRENCH sorts through the pieces of the cast. Ad libs: "such a fuckin' pussy."

COSTELLO (CONT'D)
(holding Billy by the
collar)

It makes me curious to see you in this neighborhood. Regressing. And, if I can slander my own formative environment, it makes me sad, this regressing. Plus, I don't know if it's beyond some cop prick like fucking Queenan to pull you out of the Staties, and send you after me. I just can't know. I don't know what they do in...that department, anyway.

He grabs Billy's broken right hand.

COSTELLO (CONT'D)
Are you still a cop?

BILLY
No.

COSTELLO twists Billy's broken hand.

COSTELLO
You swear on your mother's grave

that you're not a cop.

BILLY
I am not a cop.
 





 
43.

 (3)


COSTELLO
You stop doing coke deals with your jerk-off cousin?

BILLY
Yes!

COSTELLO lets go of Billy's hand. Billy is weeping on the floor. COSTELLO straightens his suit.

COSTELLO
Take it easy. Get your hand taken care of. I'm sorry. It was necessary. As for our problem with Providence...let's not cry over spilled guineas.

INT. THE MAIN PART OF THE BAR. MOMENTS LATER

COSTELLO, the visiting king, points at a group of drinkers, including a BLOND WOMAN (1st), GWEN.

COSTELLO
What’s this IRA motherfucker doing in my bar?

The IRA MOTHERFUCKER is terrified.

COSTELLO (CONT’D)
(slapping him on the back)

Only kidding. How’s your mother?

JIMMY
Ah, she’s on her way out.

COSTELLO
We all are.
(straightens suit and tie)

Act accordingly.

Costello exits.

INT. COSTELLO'S APARTMENT. NIGHT

MISTER FRENCH is methodically shelling and eating peanuts.

COSTELLO
Do you trust him?

MISTER FRENCH
These days, who's reliable?
 





 
44.




COSTELLO
His Uncle Jackie was.

MISTER FRENCH
The Costigans are talented in

general.

COSTELLO
You don’t trust a guy behaves like he’s got nothin’ to lose.

MISTER FRENCH
I'm reliable.

And he is.

COSTELLO
Well, you're one in a million.

MISTER FRENCH
Ten million.

COSTELLO
What about your wife?

MISTER FRENCH
I thought she was.

COSTELLO
She wasn't.

SILENT FLASH of MISTER FRENCH strangling his wife with a wire in a 70's bathroom.

MISTER FRENCH
She got reliable.

GWEN looks up:

GWEN
Don’t you people ever shut the fuck up?

COSTELLO
"Another county heard from."

MISTER FRENCH
One too many.
 
45.



EXT. LYNN MARSHLAND. DAWN

SEAGULLS squabble over unusual food. POWER PLANT IN THE DISTANCE, the MTA-train going by. TWO BODIES lie in a tidal ditch in the salt-marsh. They are the Italians who Billy fought in the restaurant. Hands taped together behind their backs. Two in the head each. COLIN is with the LYNN POLICE and the State Police forensics people. COLIN gets down and lifts a soaking lapel. Revealed is the tag of a men's shop in Providence.

COLIN
The principles of detection tell me that these men came from Providence.

LYNN DETECTIVE
I'd appreciate it if you got out of my crime scene.

COLIN
This is my crime scene, but knock

yourself out.

COLIN gets up. He walks back across the marsh. Opens his cell phone.

COLIN (CONT'D)
(walking)

I saw a dead guy. I think I have post traumatic stress. You available for lunch? See you then.

At a PAY PHONE he dials another number.

INT. COSTELLO'S CONDOMINIUM ON THE HARBOR. MORNING

One of Costello's homes.

COSTELLO
Who's the lead detective?...Good,

he's a moron.

BILLY cannot hear what COSTELLO is saying. He has an aluminum brace taped on his wrist and hand.

COSTELLO (CONT'D)
I want you to get the cops to look at Jimmy Pappas for the hit. Of course he had nothing to do with it and will say so. You look in
(MORE)
 



 
46.


COSTELLO (CONT'D)
his car...and find...the gun that

did it.

COLIN
In the trunk or the glove box?...

All right.

EXT. LYNN MARSHLAND. CONTINUOUS

COLIN deadpan, appreciative, hangs up the phone. BARRIGAN walks in the middle distance, giving the man his privacy.

COLIN
Wanna see some dead guys?

INT. COSTELLO'S CONDOMINIUM ON THE HARBOR. MORNING

COSTELLO sits down in the breakfast area in his bathrobe. He has a bowl of cornflakes.

COSTELLO
Have a seat, Billy.

BILLY
Thank you.

COSTELLO
(he looks up)

You know John Lennon?

BILLY sits. MISTER FRENCH are nearby.

BILLY
Yeah, he was president before

Lincoln.

COSTELLO
(smiles)

Lennon said ‘I’m an artist. You give me a fuckin’ tuba and I’ll get you something out of it’.

BILLY
I'd like to squeeze some fuckin'

money out of it.

COSTELLO and MISTER FRENCH look at each other.

COSTELLO
Smart mouth. Too bad.

COSTELLO lifts a piece of plastic on the table revealing a severed human hand. BILLY tries to conceal his shock.
 
47.



INT. SURVEILLANCE OFFICE. CONTINUOUS

QUEENAN and STAFF SGT. DIGNAM are listening to the live broadcast. QUEENAN is benign. Lights of equipment in his specs.

INT. A CONDOMINIUM ON THE HARBOR. CONTINUOUS.

COSTELLO takes the ring off the finger of the severed hand.
Partial exchange with MISTER FRENCH. BILLY watches.

COSTELLO
The point with John Lennon is a man can look at anything and make something out of it. For instance, I look at you and I think what can I use you for?

COSTELLO (CONT'D)
(giving the hand to Mister
French)
Get rid of this.
(back to Billy)
Maybe we can work something out.
Let me get dressed.

He gets up.

INT. COSTELLO'S BATHROOM. DAY

BILLY runs the water in the sink. He starts to leave the bathroom and then impulsively takes off his wire and chucks it out the window as far as he can.

EXT. THE BUILDING. DAY

The wire falls into the water.

INT. SURVEILLANCE OFFICE. CONTINUOUS.

Queenan reacts mildly to the loss of the signal. He removes his headphones.

DIGNAM
That was quick. He dead already?

EXT. "ACROPOLIS RESTAURANT". DAY

A GREEK GUY (JIMMY PAPPAS) in chef's whites is cuffed and stuffed by TACTICAL OFFICERS. He has no idea what is going on. COLIN and BARRIGAN follow.
 





 
48.




COLIN
This will get Captain Ellerby on

the six o'clock news.

BARRIGAN
No wonder you get ahead.

EXT. A STREET BY THE HARBOR. DAY

BILLY walking and talking on the phone.

BILLY
I won't do it if I have to wear a wire. No wires. Ever, ever, you understand me? You don't know what this is like.
(listens)
Micro what?

INT. SURVEILLANCE OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Queenan on the phone.

QUEENAN
Microprocessors.	We'll probably be
at war with the Chinese in twenty-
odd years and Costello is selling
them military technology.
Microprocessors, chips, computer
parts.	Anybody says anything about
anything like that, you let us
know.

EXT. POLICE BUILDING. DAY. TELEVISION IMAGE.

ELLERBY is before a thicket of microphones.

REPORTER
Did you have a tip from an

informant?

ELLERBY
No, it was tireless police activity that ah effected ah the arrest of the ah alleged perpetrator.

INT. COLIN'S OFFICE #1. DAY

COLIN is rolling a quarter across the backs of his fingers. BROWN (last seen as Billy's friend) and BARRIGAN, new plainclothes recruits to Colin's special squad, sit across from him.
 



 
49.




COLIN
I've been put in charge of this unit. It is a small surveillance sub-unit but it is mine. And I didn't take this job in order to fuck it up, or to let anyone else fuck it up, whosoever they may be. I hand picked this group. You are my A-team so I want you to conduct yourselves accordingly.

Through glass we see ELLERBY, preening. ELLERBY gives the thumbs up.

COLIN (CONT'D)
Hi, Captain. And our primary target is obviously Frank Costello. But we don't communicate with anyone else in this shop. Queenan is compartmentalizing everything in SIU. It’s the right thing to do, personally I don’t trust these fucking troopers either. We think we might have a problem. We think Costello’s got a rat in the State Police.

BROWN
Really?

COLIN
Yeah.	Really.

BROWN
Do we have direct access to

Queenan's undercovers?

COLIN
(not happy about this) No. Ah...not presently. Not presently. But I'm hoping to get things...reorganized. That's it. Congratulations. Don’t disappoint me.

BROWN and BARRIGAN leave.	Colin leaves as well.

BARRIGAN
(to Brown)
I know why I'm here.	I made him

feel guilty.	Why are you here?
 





 
50.

 (2)


BROWN
Intelligence and aptitude.

BARRIGAN
That's new.

COLIN opens his cell phone.

COLIN
Hello Dad.	I have a new job.
(ALT: I got a promotion.)

INT. A BOOKIE SHOP. DAY

MISTER FRENCH backhands a guy into a table of betting slips.

MISTER FRENCH
Where's your fucking license? I

don't see no fucking license.

BOOKIE
What license.

BILLY, who is not wearing a cast anymore, watches.

MISTER FRENCH
There's no such thing as a license, of course, but you definitely have to have one.
(grabs the bookie by the
ear)
If you are not being run by us you will be run by someone else, which means you will have let undesirable elements into Mr. Costello's area.

A HARD GUY sitting reaches inside his coat. BILLY in a flash breaks his jaw with a pistol barrel and then covers the sprawled HARD GUY with the gun.

HARD GUY
(spitting teeth)
I was going for my fucking

cigarettes...

He was. They fall from his fingers.

MISTER FRENCH
Hey, that's Jimmy Bags.	What the
fuck you doin'?
 






 
51.




BILLY
What the fuck.	I didn't know....

BOOKIE
There's no profit if I pay him two grand a week. I'm in the hole if I pay him two grand a week.

MISTER FRENCH
Then make more money or go out of
business. This is America. If you
don't make money you're a fucking
douchebag. What are you going to

do?

BOOKIE
Make more money.

MISTER FRENCH
That's the spirit.

EXT. THE STREET OUTSIDE THE BOOKIE SHOP. LATER

BILLY and MISTER FRENCH emerge.

MISTER FRENCH
Very interesting.

BILLY
Yeah, well. Fuck.

MISTER FRENCH
Don't worry about it. Guy didn't need need his teeth anyway. Maybe if he was an Eskimo. But in this country we eat a variety of items.

They get into COSTELLO'S CAR. Billy in the front seat. Mister French in the back.

MISTER FRENCH (CONT'D)
He knocked Jimmy Bags teeth out.

COSTELLO does an Edgar Kennedy.

COSTELLO
So?

BILLY
He was...
 






 
52.




MISTER FRENCH
Reaching for his cigarettes.

BILLY
Okay! You gonna give me shit, it wasn't no reason——he put his hand in his coat! I don't know if he’s a bookie or what the fuck he’s doing...

COSTELLO
(interrupting)
Well, you know what the fuck a

bookie does?

BILLY
(to Costello)

Pays you.

COSTELLO
Bingo. Anyway, I like a guy who goes around knocking guys teeth out for no reason.

He takes out a cell phone and hands it to BILLY.

COSTELLO (CONT’D)
Here. From now on call the bar and ask for Mikey. Just Mikey. You ask for Mikey because there’s no Mikey. Wait. We'll call.

MISTER FRENCH
Forty-eight hours from the time
this phone first rings, you take
the fucking chip out - like so -
and you fucking destroy it. After
three days a phone ain’t clean. If
you use a phone which is not clean,
you will have a accident. You never
call us. We call you. You got that?

BILLY
I got it.

MISTER FRENCH
I can't fuckin' hear you.

BILLY
I got it.
 
53.



INT. A HARBOR RESTAURANT. BOSTON. DAY

A lobster-bib kind of place. DAYTIME DRINKERS, MICKS in bad boat shoes, hyper-aware of... COSTELLO and BILLY in a back table. COSTELLO, having finished his lunch, is drawing. Billy is unused to being the subject of so many stares. He has sort of a coked-out nervousness, dirty hair.

BILLY
Don't look.	There’s a white van
across the parking lot?

WE see it through the smeared glass: the WHITE VAN we always see. This time with a different magnetic business sign.

COSTELLO
(lifting and looking at
his sketch)
They don't have directional

microphones.

BILLY
What, do you got x-ray vision?

COSTELLO
(not taking his eyes off
his sketch)
They don't have directional

microphones.

BILLY registers what seems to be inside information. COSTELLO looks over his half-glasses at Billy's untouched food. COSTELLO is sizing Billy up: has been thinking about him.

COSTELLO (CONT'D)
People looking at you make you self-conscious?

BILLY shrugs. Indicating: Yeah, well, who the fuck wouldn't be.

BILLY
I don't know.

COSTELLO
Why? They’re minuses. They can’t tell the difference between a rock star and a career criminal.

BILLY
Anyone not a criminal is a minus?
 




 
54.




COSTELLO
What are you soft? That's not what I said. Eat something, Jesus Christ, we got a nice day by the water. Sun's shining, gulls are up...Nice smell of ozone...

TWO PRIESTS and a NUN are sitting two tables over. An older priest and a younger one. COSTELLO notices. THE NUN gets up and leaves.

COSTELLO (CONT'D)
You know if your father were alive and saw you, sitting here with me, let’s say he would have a word with me about this, in fact, he'd kill seven guys just to cut my throat. And he could do it, which is something you may not know about William Costigan, Sr.

BILLY
He never, ah, I mean never?

COSTELLO
He kept his own counsel. He never wanted money. You can't do a thing with a man like that. Your uncle Jackie needed a lot of money. But even though he got his money from me, he also would kill my entire fucking family if he saw me here with you. And I think about this.

BILLY
So what are talking about here?

COSTELLO
Fact is you're not a guy fresh from the zoo who wants to run a spring water distributor and I don't see you up the dog track as a general manager.

BILLY
Look at it this way.	It's like a
tuba.	I want to see if I can get
something out of it.

COSTELLO smiles at this, then looks at his sketch.
 






 
55.

 (2)


COSTELLO
You ever think of going back to

school?

BILLY
With all due respect, Mr. Costello, school’s out.

COSTELLO
Well that's your problem. Maybe

someday you'll wake the fuck up.

He gets up and leaves the table, leaving BILLY sitting there.
COSTELLO stops to speak to the priests.

COSTELLO (CONT'D)
Good day, Fathers.

PRIESTS
(terrified and
simultaneously)
Good morning [day], Francis, good

morning.

The OLDER PRIEST is very nervous, looking around. The YOUNGER PRIEST concerned for his elder but personally not implicated. COSTELLO leans over the OLDER PRIEST, a pathetic man.

COSTELLO
You recall our chat?
(the OLDER PRIEST nods,
terrified)
"I am as God made me", was that
what you said? May I remind you,
God don't run the bingo in this
archdiocese.

YOUNG PRIEST
May I remind you, Mr. Costello,

that pride comes before the fall.

COSTELLO
What comes before the Fall is the

Summertime.

COSTELLO notices that THE NUN is heading back to the table.

COSTELLO (CONT'D)
How is Sister Mary Theresa doing? We had a tasty relationship before she took her vows. Enjoy your clams, cocksuckers.
 
56.



INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT

FITZY beats up a guy with a pipe. Billy watches from the background.

EXT. WATERFRONT - NIGHT

FITZY and the Costello gang blow up a car as Billy watches.
Laughing, they hop in their vehicles and drive off.

INT. ELLERBY'S OFFICE. MORNING

OFFICE decorated with golf implements. ELLERBY has a hangover. Sunglasses. Eating baby aspirin by the small fistful.

COLIN
I'm not making enough progress with

Costello?

ELLERBY
"Progress" is hard to define. I make progress every day. In fact, I'm making progress now. There are guys in this department make excellent progress for twenty years without ever getting anything you could definitively call a result. It's like any American industry. Nobody minds if you don't succeed as long as you don't fuck up.

He has a bowl of ice water on his desk.

ELLERBY (CONT'D)
Objectives get lost sight of: fair
enough.	Who did the two guys from

Providence?

COLIN
Jimmy Pappas.

ELLERBY
And what happened to Jimmy Pappas?

COLIN
He had a heart attack in jail and got knifed in his bed at Boston City Hospital. I believe it's been in the papers.

ELLERBY stares at COLIN.
 




 
57.




ELLERBY
Are you happy with this result?

COLIN
It's a result.

ELLERBY
Yeah, but cui bono? Who benefits.

COLIN
Cui gives a shit. It's got a bow on it.

ELLERBY
(with true appreciation)

I think you are a cop, my son.

He drops his face into the bowl of ice water.

INT. BILLY'S MOTHER'S APARTMENT. MORNING

A stripped HOSPITAL BED stands in a fall of light. This is the apartment where his mother became ill. Billy has packed half of his mother's things into boxes—and then stopped.

Billy doesn't use the bedroom. He sleeps on the couch among boxes of pictures, papers, teacups wrapped in newspaper. BILLY is sitting on the couch. He reaches into a box and lays out photographs like cards. Scenes from his life. His former life. His family life, his life as a child, his romantic life. He sits and stares at the pictures. He rearranges the photographs in different ways.

NOTE: THIS IS A MEMORY BILLY HAS AS HE IS LOOKING AT PHOTOGRAPHS ON HIS MOTHER’S APARTMENT.

FRENCH and BILLY break in, surprising the MAN (BRIAN), seated at his dining room table. He throws a child’s toy at them. FRENCH ducks out of the way and the toy hits BILLY in the cheek.

FRENCH draws his pistol and approaches the table. BRIAN rises and starts to flee. Cut off, he retreats the other way.

BRIAN
No, please...

FRENCH
Brian, stop it, I ain’t gonna hurt you.
 






 
58.




He fires, using a soda bottle as a silencer. BRIAN drops to the floor. FRENCH approaches him assessing his victim.

He turns to leave, passing BILLY.	He give him a slap.

FRENCH (CONT’D)
Wake the fuck up.

They leave.

EXT. A BEACH NEAR A POWERPLANT. DAY

BILLY leans against the wall of a concession stand. His knuckles are cut. A cut over his eye. He is agitated. Smoking. A car pulls up and Queenan and Dignam get out of it. In appearance, if anybody's watching, they're bracing Billy.

QUEENAN
Hey.	Let's go through the routine.

DIGNAM
You think you can pop someone.
There's no special card to play.
The guy whose jaw you broke was

Boston Police Department.

BILLY
I'm going fuckin' nuts. I can't be someone else every day.

DIGNAM
Most of the people in the world do it every day. What's the big deal?

Dignam is drinking coffee.

BILLY
I'm not them.

DIGNAM
You're nobody. You signed the
paper.	We're the only people in
the world who know that you're a
cop.	Maybe we'll just erase your

file.

This is Billy's deepest fear.
 










 
59.




DIGNAM (CONT'D)
And zip, you're a soldier for
Costello, open to arrest for how
many felonies?	Maybe we'll do

that.

BILLY
Maybe I'll fucking kill you.

He gets free of DIGNAM and punches him.

QUEENAN
Easy now.	That was a joke, Billy.

DIGNAM
Just because you play a fucking tough guy doesn't mean you are one, you lace curtain fucking pussy.

The fight. QUEENAN grabs Billy and holds him against the wall.

QUEENAN
(gently, like a man
calming a wild animal)
Be smart. If someone was watching
how are we supposed to not arrest

you?

BILLY looks desperately inland.

REVERE BEACH condominium buildings. A thousand empty terraces, five thousand empty windows. BILLY is desperate.

QUEENAN (CONT'D)
Get in the car.

They do.

QUEENAN (CONT'D)
Keep your act together. It's just a little while longer.

BILLY nods, out of it. DIGNAM is looking at blood on his hands in disbelief.

BILLY
When are you going to take Costello? What's wrong with taking 'em on any one of the million felonies you've seen him do. Get him for pissing in the street.

BILLY (CONT'D)

What, are you waiting for him to chop me up and feed me to the poor?

DIGNAM
Well. That would stick...

QUEENAN
You shut up. We're building a case. It takes time. You know that.

BILLY
There's something wrong.

QUEENAN
Maybe. Maybe.

DIGNAM
Keep your ears opened.	No
bullshit.

QUEENAN
I want you to listen for any chatter about a spy in the Special Investigation Unit.
(BILLY looks at him)

You hear anything like that?

BILLY shakes his head.

BILLY
Are you serious?

QUEENAN
I'm afraid so.

BILLY
Jesus H. Christ.

QUEENAN
Hang tight for me. Just a little

longer.	We're this close.

BILLY nods reluctantly.

BILLY
Okay.

QUEENAN
Thank you, Billy

INT. OBSERVATION OFFICE. DAY

COLIN walks into the office. BROWN and other team members are watching a closed-circuit monitor. The MONITOR shows FITZY sitting in an interrogation room. COLIN is spooked.

COLIN
(to Brown)

What have you got?

BROWN
Uniform clipped him on the Pike for a suspended licence. However, as he's the subject of an open investigation——

COLIN
At least one. He's one of

Costello's crew.

BROWN
——we're entitled to get a warrant. We can't get an address off him. He paged his lawyer but the lawyer hasn't called back yet.

COLIN
Who's the lawyer?

BROWN
He didn't know the name. He just
had the number on a card. Beeper

number.

COLIN
Did he beep him?

BROWN
Twice.

COLIN
All right.

COLIN glances around and sees: a briefcase lying on a desk. He picks it up. He takes off his ID badge and tosses it on a desk.

COLIN (CONT'D)
Give me your phone.
(to Barrigan)

Turn the camera off.	Turn it off.
 





 
62.




He takes Brown's cellphone out of Brown's pocket goes into the interrogation room.

BROWN
What?

COLIN
Give my your phone and turn the fucking camera off. Who's is this? I'm gonna take this.

He picks up a BRIEFCASE. BARRIGAN touches two buttons and switches off the sound recorder and video feed. COLIN goes into the interrogation room.

BROWN
He can't do that, can he?

BARRIGAN
He just did.

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM. CONTINUOUS

FITZY looks up at COLIN hopefully. COLIN says nothing. He sits down, opens his case, takes out a yellow pad.

COLIN
Mr. Fitzgibbon, afternoon.

FITZY
You my attorney?

COLIN
What do you think?	Did you make
any statements or phone calls I

need to be aware of?

FITZY
I beeped you.	The card they gave
me...that's it.

COLIN
That's it? Don't you have to call your mother and tell her you're not gonna be home for supper?

ON FITZY. He looks up at the CCTV camera.
 










 
63.




COLIN (CONT'D)
The cameras are off.
(gently puts phone on the
table)

Call your mother.

Fitzy hesitates.

COLIN (CONT'D)
Lookit. They're in there suiting up for a raid. I don't know where they are going, but they do. And so do you. Call your mum.

COLIN puts a cellphone on the table. FITZY takes up the phone and punches in a number. It is answered.

FITZY
Mum, I'm not gonna make it for supper. I got held up. Yeah, talk to you later.

INT. A HOUSE WHERE DRUGS ARE BEING HANDLED. CONTINUOUS

BILLY looks up at MISTER FRENCH, who is on the phone. Other men are frozen, holding bags of Ex.

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM. CONTINUOUS.

FITZY closes the cellphone. He puts it into COLIN'S hand.

INT. A HOUSE WHERE DRUGS ARE BEING HANDLED. CONTINUOUS

MISTER FRENCH
Everybody out.	Move.

The DRUGS are swept up instantly, in sheets laid over the tables. MISTER FRENCH lights a cigarette with his ZIPPO, and then reaches out and lights the curtains on fire as BILLY watches.

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM. CONTINUOUS.

COLIN takes the cellphone and puts it in his pocket.

FITZY
Who are you? When do I get out of here?
 








 
64.




COLIN
I think you need another attorney, after all, Mr. Fitzgibbon. Have a nice day.

INT. OBSERVATION OFFICE.CONTINUOUS

COLIN comes out and hands BROWN the CELLPHONE.

COLIN
Run the last number called. That'll be his house. Whatever the location is I'll swear I surveilled him at it. Abracafuckindabra.

BROWN
Why'd you use my phone?

COLIN
Because you didn't go in there.

INT. COLIN'S APARTMENT - DAY

COLIN, hung-over, sits at the breakfast table. Madolyn looks at him.

MADOLYN
The light's nice here in the

morning.

COLIN doesn't respond.

MADOLYN (CONT'D)
It's all right. Guys tend to make a big deal out of it. It's actually quite common.

COLIN
I gotta go to work.

COLIN simply gets up and walks away.

INT. MADOLYN’S OFFICE. DAY

A clock ticking. Madolyn is looking across at ...Billy. Madolyn is very much a guarded shrink. But no one's more guarded than Billy.

BILLY
It's like confession. Isn't it.

This sort of thing.
 





 
65.




A beat.

BILLY (CONT’D)
People make things up in

confession. You know that?

MADOLYN
I know they do.

BILLY
People are liars. They want to be

stars of their little films.

MADOLYN
That’s an interesting observation.

BILLY
Do you lie?

MADOLYN
Why do you?

BILLY
I'm asking if you lie.

MADOLYN
Honesty isn’t synonymous with

truth.

BILLY
You lie. So, is it to do some good, to get somewhere personally, or just for the fuck of it?

MADOLYN
I expect sometimes...people...do it to keep things...on an even keel.

BILLY
So, you had a parent who was a

drunk?

MADOLYN looks up at him, transpierced. Tables turned on the psychiatrist. BILLY smiles at her.

MADOLYN
(flustered)

Did you?

BILLY
(simply)

No.
 




 
66.

 (2)


MADOLYN
Let’s keep this with you.

BILLY
(abruptly)

There was a cop leaving when I came in.

MADOLYN
How do you know he was a cop?

BILLY
Bad haircut, no dress sense and a slight air of scumbag entitlement. You see cops?

MADOLYN
That’s part of what I do. Although, I don’t normally see cadets who were kicked out of the Academy.

BILLY
You should get a better job...

BILLY (CONT'D)
Do they all come in and cry...your cops?

MADOLYN
Sometimes they cry if they had
trouble at home or if they’ve had

to...use their weapons.

BILLY
Let me tell you something. They signed up to use their fuckin' weapons. Most of them. But they watch enough TV so they know they have to "weep" after they use their weapons. No one's more full of shit than a cop. Except a cop on TV.

MADOLYN
I looked through your file and I
see you have a record of assault.

What was it like for you in jail?

BILLY
You want to hear about the showers?

MADOLYN
Did something happen to you?
 




 
67.

 (3)


BILLY
No.
(a beat)

You sit there with a mass murderer, your heart-rate jacked, your hand...steady. That's one thing I found out about myself in prison. My hand doesn't shake, ever.

MADOLYN
What do you expect from coming

here?

BILLY
I have to come here.

MADOLYN
I know it’s not elective...on your part...but, now that you’re here, what do you want?

BILLY
You want the truth?
(a beat)

Valium.

MADOLYN
If you lied, you'd have an easier

time getting what you wanted.

BILLY
What's that say about what you do

for a living?

Madolyn is taken aback. She closes her file.

MADOLYN
Look, I think we better have a few more meetings before we can even talk about prescriptions.

She closes his file and puts it in the rack behind her.

BILLY
I'm having panic attacks. You didn't even ask about that. Last night I thought I was having a fucking heart attack. I puked in a trash barrel on the way in here, I haven't slept for weeks.
