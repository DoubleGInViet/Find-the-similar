MADOLYN
Is this true?

BILLY
Yes. I said something true. I want some fucking pills and you close my file? I thought I was supposed to tell the truth here.

MADOLYN
Yes, you are.

BILLY
If only fuckin' here.

She retrieves his folder.

BILLY (CONT'D)
(giving into stress)

Guy comes in in pain, against every instinct of ...privacy, of, of, self reliance... that he has, and you don't help him? You send him off to score smack on the fucking street?! (Is that what you do, Mrs. Fuckin’ Doctor?)

MADOLYN stares at him, then lowers her eyes, takes out a small packet of two pills. She hands it over to him. BILLY looks at it.

BILLY (CONT’D)
Two pills.

She nods. BILLY reaches out and deliberately places the pills on the desk.

BILLY (CONT'D)
Why don't you just give me a bottle of scotch and a handgun to blow my fucking head off. Are we done here with this psychiatry bullshit?

MADOLYN is taken aback, guilty, astonished.

MADOLYN
You can leave!

BILLY
What if that was a legitimate

threat? (Hot shot).
 





 
69.

BILLY leaves. MADOLYN stares after him.

MADOLYN
Fuck...

EXT. PLAZA OUTSIDE THE OFFICE BUILDING. DAY

Very windy. Papers blowing. Billy is walking. Madolyn catches up to him.

MADOLYN
Why is the hardest patient of the

day always the last one?

BILLY
Because you're bored and tired and don't give a shit. It's not supernatural.

MADOLYN
Look, I'm not just...somebody you have to see or they put you in jail. If you are in distress I will help you.

Madolyn holds out a paper and a business card.

BILLY
What's this?

MADOLYN
My card. And a prescription for

twenty Lorazepam.

BILLY stands holding the prescription.

BILLY
Is it enough to kill myself?

MADOLYN
(she fixes him with a
stare)

Maybe it is. All right? Have I done my job up to your goddamned standards? Because by my standards you fit the model of drug-seeking behavior, and fuck you if you don't like my initial clinical reaction.

BILLY
(re: prescription)

Thank you.
 




 
70.




MADOLYN
I'm transferring you to another

counselor.

She starts to go back inside.

BILLY
You wanna get a cup of coffee?

INT. COMMAND CENTER (UPSTAIRS). NIGHT. A WEEK LATER

It's an otherwise disused floor of a new luxury office building. Cables and monitors and computers everywhere. It's crawling with State Cops as well as FBI (LAZIO is present, very nattily dressed). COLIN comes in with BROWN and BARRIGAN. This operation is all new to Colin.

ELLERBY
All right, let’s bring it in,
please.	Come in please.
(addressing room)

Our target is a major transaction of microprocessors. Yes, those. I don’t know what they are. You don’t know what they are. Who gives a fuck? Cash will be handed over in a building which we have under AV surveillance. Staff Sergeant Sullivan's team...
(he nods at COLIN)

Will ID the bad guys and listen in on the phones.

COLIN
(to his guys)
Did you guys know anything about

this?

No.

ELLERBY
(to LAZIO)
How long have we been tapped on

this building?

ELLERBY (CONT'D)
Our unit will not take action until a man Captain Queenan has inside the operation has verified the transaction. Questions? Anyone? This is who we're after.
(taps picture of Costello)
(MORE)
 


 
71.


ELLERBY (CONT'D)
We've been after this cocksucker
for a long time, and tonight we're

gonna get him. Get to work.

ON COLIN as he reflexively touches his cell phone and thinks about the best way out of this.

ELLERBY (CONT'D)
We've been after this son of a
bitch for a long time, and we're

getting him tonight. Get to work.

COLIN
(to team)
Go find out what we're doing and

get on it.

COLIN wanders off in the mill of officers. He is taking out his cell phone when ELLERBY comes up to him.

ELLERBY
Sorry to get you at the last minute. But things leak. This lead came from Queenan's undercover guy.

ELLERBY walks on to a COFFEE STATION, a yard away.

COLIN
(into cell)

Dad?

COSTELLO (O.S.)
(on phone)

Yes?

COLIN is completely normal on the phone.

COLIN
I'm not going to make dinner.

Something big has come up.

INT. COSTELLO'S APARMENT. CONTINUOUS

COSTELLO is on the phone.

COSTELLO
Too bad. Your mother worked all
goddamned day. We'll just have to
sit down without you and your

friends.
 
72.



INT. COMMAND CENTER. CONTINUOUS

COLIN turns away from the activity.

COLIN
Oh, my friends are still coming.

COLIN sees QUEENAN staring at him.

COLIN (CONT'D)
We'll just say lunch tomorrow. All right, bye.

COLIN ends the call. QUEENAN is there.

QUEENAN
The readiness is all. You know the players, call the game.

COLIN
Thank you, Captain.

He gives him the clipboard, Colin goes to the work area.

LATER

COLIN joins his team (BROWN AND BARRIGAN), who are seated in a U shaped work-area. COLIN, still stunned by the fact of this operations center, swallows as he notices on video three angles of a building he seems to know very well. He sits down and puts a headset on. A GEEK COP leans over and shakes his hand.

GEEK COP
Piece of cake. I'll operate the
cameras. You ID the guys and log

them.

COLIN nods. QUEENAN comes up.

QUEENAN
All cellphone signals are under
surveillance through the courtesy
of our Federal friends over

there...

COLIN looks: sees LAZIO and two others.

ELLERBY
(as if on coke and he
probably is)

Patriot Act. Love it. Love it.
 




 
73.




COLIN, using his left hand, not looking, opens his cellphone, autodials, and then taps an instant message into it, pushes "Send."

DETAIL OF IM: "No Phones"

ONSCREEN, CARS PULL UP IN FRONT OF THE TARGET BUILDING.

COLIN
All right. That's Costello right there. Costello, Mister French, Fitzy, Delahunt, Billy Costigan the new guy...Time is 10.46.

BROWN
Who are they meeting?

ELLERBY
(leaning over screens)
I don't know. Some Chinamen from
points unknown. They're already

inside.

DETAIL OF COLIN'S PHONE. COLIN hits "send", sending the message "No phones". THE SCREEN then reads "Erasing Sent Message".

EXT. TARGET BUILDING. NIGHT

COSTELLO and the boys go into the building, moving past TWO IDLING CARS. We see Costello look casually at his phone.

INT. COMMAND CENTER. CONTINUOUS

Watching images. COSTELLO'S GUYS move through pillars and disappear.

CAMERA GEEK COP
We have a blind spot.

ELLERBY
Why do you have a blind spot?

CAMERA GEEK COP
We had two hour's notice. Two hours. What the fuck you think this is, NASA?

ELLERBY
It never crossed my mind. You get a camera in the back?
 





 
74.




TECH COP IN DOWN VEST
What back?

Ellerby blows his nose. He is on coke. COLIN sends another TEXT MESSAGE: “Blind spot inside door.”

INT. TARGET BUILDING. CONTINUOUS - REVISED 6/8-9/05

COSTELLO looks at his IM screen and turns to his guys.

COSTELLO
Turn off your cell phones.

FITZY and some others mutter.

COSTELLO (CONT’D)
Check your weapons...Fitzy has the chicken...

Everyone turns off their phones, including BILLY (but we know Billy has TWO phones).

BILLY looks around at the pillared distances. He sees:

A GROUP OF THREE MEN waiting and FIVE OTHER MEN spreading out through the pillars. Armed.

INT. COMMAND CENTER. CONTINUOUS

CAMERA COP
(to no one, and maybe OS)
Maybe if we had some Homeland
security money like some other
fucking douchebags I could

mention...

Both Brown and Colin have their headsets on.

QUEENAN
Any calls?

PHONE TECH COP
They turned off their phones.

COLIN looks utterly innocent.

ELLERBY
Search randomly for calls made from the area.
 







 
75.




PHONE TECH COP
Eight hundred seven phones are live in this area.

ELLERBY
Narrow the area.

LAZIO
What you see for coverage is what

you get.

DIGNAM
(like Queenan, an observer
of Ellerby's operation)
Why the fuck did they turn off

their phones?

PHONE TECH COP
Wait, there's still one phone up.

DIGNAM
Where?

A single light on the screen. QUEENAN looks at an IM (from Billy) on his phone.

DETAIL: "buyers here". ("$")

QUEENAN
The buyers are there.

COLIN wonders how Queenan knew this. The single light winks out on the screen. ELLERBY looks at Queenan, impressed.

ELLERBY
You know, direct access to your
fucking guys would have certain

fuckin' advantages.

QUEENAN
(mildly)

Not to my guy.

ELLERBY stares at him.

DIGNAM
This is unbelievable.
(looking at screens)

Fuck it, who put the cameras in the fucking place?
 






 
76.

 (2)


CAMERA TECH COP
Who the fuck are you.

DIGNAM
I'm the guy who does his job. You

must be the other guy.

QUEENAN
Hey, hey, hey...

INT. AN OPEN AREA IN THE RUINED BUILDING. NIGHT

COSTELLO’S BOYS spread out. Across the open, lumber-strewn area, CHINESE GANG MEMBERS are waiting.

A LOCAL CHINESE-AMERICAN MAN acting as the interpreter and fixer stands waiting near a SUITCASE on the floor. With the CHINESE GANGSTERS is a more official looking MAN IN A BAD SUIT - terrified. FITZY carries a case containing the processors.

COSTELLO
(to translator)

How you going, Robert?

CHINESE TRANSLATOR
Tops, Mr. Costello.	I want to tell
you that at least two of these

gents have machine guns.

COSTELLO takes it all in. The CHINESE GANGSTER looks like a Malay pirate. Costello’s gunmen are perched above, automatic weapons trained on the Triad.

BILLY sneaks a message to Queenan via Text Message,"$" to indicate “buyers here.”

CHINESE GANGSTER
(in Cantonese, not
subtitled)

Waiting, waiting. We almost departed! This man is from the Embassy. He will have to blow his brains out if he is captured. His entire family will be killed.

CHINESE TRANSLATOR
He’s a little upset.

COSTELLO
Tell him light on the starch.
 





 
77.




BILLY is watching carefully. [As (INSERT) ONSCREEN in the OPERATIONS ROOM the last lights wink off...] He removes his hand from his pocket, having just switched off his phone.

CHINESE TRANSLATOR
(roughly translating)
He’s fronting the Chinese
government and he’s just scared

shitless.

COSTELLO
Government man.
(loudly, to Chinese)

I’m concerned about Chinamen who think it's wise to bring automatic weapons to a business transaction.

The CHINESE GANGSTER interjects --

CHINESE GANGSTER
Ngup, Ngup, Ngup.	Ngaw um ming.
Kay ngup mutt.	[Yap, yap, yap.	I
don’t understand.	What is he
saying?]

The CHINESE TRANSLATOR translates Costello’s statement about “concern.”

SEVERAL OF THE TRIAD, hearing a “automatic weapon,” stupidly raise their MACHINE GUNS. They don’t aim them.

COSTELLO
For his own good, tell Bruce Lee and the Karate Kids none of us are carrying automatic weapons because here, in this country, it don’t add inches to your dick. You get a life sentence for it.

We (but no one else) hear a double click as MISTER FRENCH cocks a pistol behind his back.

CHINESE GANGSTER
(in Cantonese)

Put away that machine gun.

The MACHINE GUN is put away.
 










 
78.

 (2)


COSTELLO
If these chinks want to nuke Taiwan any time in this century, you tell them they better shape up fast and show me one million dollars.

The CHINESE TRANSLATOR translates.

COSTELLO (CONT'D)
What we generally do in this
country is one guy shows up with
the items, and the other guy pays

him.	No tickee...no laundry.

COSTELLO gestures and a BOX of PROCESSORS is put on the floor. Opened. The CHINESE GANGSTER gestures and a case of money is put on the floor. Opened. FITZY looks at it, nods.

CHINESE GANGSTER
Nay tiey ching chaw yut bok mon. [Make sure it’s real. It’s a million dollars.]. ALTERNATE/ALSO (insult): Ne dei yeeche ling ngnaw dong maw gok nay chun. [Next time you make me wait, I’m going to cut your dick off.

COSTELLO
In English, thank you, also.

CHINESE GANGSTER
Du ne. [Fuck you.]

The deal is done.

COSTELLO
The expedition continues this way.

To Billy’s surprise both Costello’s men and the Chinese head out through the back industrial windows onto a canal-side pier.

INT. COMMAND CENTER. CONTINUOUS

The CARS of the CHINESE GUYS are driven away, passing a van full of...

Startled TACTICAL COPS. TWO TACTICAL UNITS are hidden outside.
 
79.



INT. COMMAND CENTER. CONTINUOUS

ELLERBY is staring at the screens.

ELLERBY
Don't tell me those cars were
empty. Please don't tell me those
Chinamen's cars were empty.
(to Camera Tech Cop)

Do you have a camera in the back.

An IMAGE comes up. Nothing.

ELLERBY (CONT'D)
Can I talk to you a minute?

As the Camera Technician gets up, Ellerby pounces on him.

EXT. BEHIND THE BUILDING. CONTINUOUS

Tied to the pier there are two boats, a NOVI LOBSTER BOAT and a BOSTON WHALER with a guys we've never seen at the wheel (random getaway hires). The TRIAD members get into the NOVI, and chug away. Fitzy carries the SUITCASES OF MONEY onto a BOSTON WHALER and it takes off. COSTELLO turns to Billy.

COSTELLO
See, no surveillance here. They didn’t figure we had a navy. Always figure an exit for your business partners. What with everything all dug up, you can't trust a slant to find the Mass Pike and, with or without Staties out front, frankly I don't approve of orientals driving to begin with.

BILLY
What about us, Frank?	What’re we
gonna do?

COSTELLO
We depart.	We didn't commit no
illegalities.

BILLY is stunned. Admiring.

MISTER FRENCH
Except sell the ching chongs a

bunch of fuckin' plastic.
 






 
80.




The CHINESE GUYS, staring back, chug away down the canal in the lobster boat. BILLY watches COSTELLO go, admiringly, and then follows him.

EXT. STREET NEAR TARGET BUILDING - NIGHT	103A

A few blocks from the target building, a Police Tactical unit stops the departing Triad cars with a roadblock. As officers approach the cars they realize they are empty except for hired Caucasian drivers. An officer reports this to the command center.

INT. COLIN'S APARTMENT. DAY

Colin is asleep on the couch, in a bachelor disaster of Chinese food boxes. Something on TV: "Audition." A key in the door: He wakes as MADOLYN comes in carrying a bag of coffees and a BOX OF EFFECTS.

MADOLYN
Good Morning.

MADOLYN smiles at him, also shy.

COLIN
Good morning.

MADOLYN
I beat the movers.

COLIN
How was the last night in the, ah, old establishment?

MADOLYN
(putting the box on the kitchen
counter)

Lonely.

COLIN
I'm glad to hear that.	It sucked
here, too.

They kiss.	MADOLYN takes in the apartment.

MADOLYN
I'm gonna thank your Uncle

Alphonsus for the square footage.

COLIN
Uncle Alphonsus is in heaven.	So
am I.
 




 
81.




MADOLYN unpacks food.	Coffee.	Croissants.

MADOLYN
French donut?

COLIN
(re: box of stuff)

Yeah.	Hey, can I...

MADOLYN
Sure yeah.

He sorts through the box. It's all Madolyn's key stuff - a mug, a few critical books...framed family pictures, breakables...and comes up with: A PHOTOGRAPH of a young Madolyn standing in front of a North East rust belt slum.

COLIN
Well, we're not having this out.

MADOLYN
What?

MADOLYN isn't prepared to be at cross-purposes. But she is taken aback. She puts the photo quietly away. Contaminated.

COLIN
You don't see any pictures of where I came from. Look, I respect who you are, but not in the living room. We might have company.

MADOLYN
Company?

She laughs.	COLIN looks at a diploma.	Veritas.

COLIN
Why work for the state?

MADOLYN
Why not?	You do.

COLIN
Not forever, and you don't have to. You've got degrees...you're a hot shit... I mean, what you do, why make as much as a guidance counselor?
 







 
82.

 (2)


MADOLYN
(deadpan, over her coffee
cup)

I believe in public service.

COLIN stares at her.

COLIN
Now you're just being ridiculous.

MADOLYN
(kissing him, and
intently:)

You like me living here?

COLIN
(hands down her shorts)

Yes I do.

THE PHONE (landline with mobile handset) rings.

COLIN (CONT'D)
Answer it.	You live here.

MADOLYN, not 100% confused by his seizing on the interruption, gets the phone.

MADOLYN
Mayor Sullivan's Office.

After a moment she holds the receiver out to COLIN.

MADOLYN (CONT'D)
(whispering)

I'm sorry!

COLIN
Who is it?

MADOLYN
I think it's a guy with a, ah,
(She touches her throat,
and whispers)

A cancer guy.

COLIN reaches in his pocket and looks at his cellphone: dead. A bad mistake in his situation. He crams the phone into a table charger beside the landline and takes the handset.

COLIN
Hello?
 





 
83.

 (3)


COLIN exits the kitchen.

COLIN (CONT'D)
(to Madolyn)

Something for work.

MADOLYN looks after him. She doesn't start eating again, she watches Colin. She is seen staring at him through the following scene.

COSTELLO (V.O.)
What the fuck is it with your

phone?

EXT. THE CHELSEA YACHT CLUB. CONTINUOUS

COSTELLO, with his collar turned up, is walking along the floats. Wearing a headset.

INTERCUT TERRACE OF COLIN'S APARTMENT/CHELSEA YACHT CLUB. CONTINUOUS

COLIN hunches, closing the glass door, and glancing in at Madolyn.

COLIN
Nothin’, nothin'. It doesn't have
any power, that's all. It just

happened once.

COSTELLO
Was that that shrink cunt answered the phone?

COLIN
Yes. Yes. As I said, she was gonna move in, so she moved in.

COSTELLO
You better get organized, quick.

COLIN
Last time I checked, I tipped you

off and you're not in jail.

COSTELLO
Are you listening to me?

COLIN
Yes.
 






 
84.




COSTELLO
Are listening to me, son? Do you like Little Miss Thing sucking your cock?

COLIN looks in at MADOLYN.

COLIN
Yes. Yes I do.

COLIN is frustrated.

COSTELLO
So earn it.
(a beat)
I'm gettin’ the feeling we got a

cop in my crew.

COLIN
I been gettin’ that same feeling.

COSTELLO
He’s one of yours. Inside. Have you seen anything?

COLIN
Look, I have no access to undercover files in Queenan's department. It's locked up. Queenan and Dignam run the snitches. They don’t give anybody a peep. I'm doing the best...

COSTELLO
(interrupting)

Your best? What do you think we're in, the fuckin' haberdashery business?

COLIN takes a breath, tries to reason and mind his place.

COLIN
Please Frank, if you don’t relax I can’t relax. Let’s start with this...get me all the information on the people around you last night. Everyone that works for you. Get me real first names. Get me...
 








 
85.

 (2)


COSTELLO
(interrupting Colin)
Get you?	Give you?	Who the fuck

do you work for?

COLIN
Okay, Frank...I'm sorry...could you please get me social security numbers, ah, I need drivers license numbers, full names, dates of birth, anything like that. Bank account numbers, everything that you don't get from a criminal record or, or a wrap sheet or a...

COSTELLO
(relenting a little)
Collie, calm down or you’ll shoot
in your pants. I'll get you the
records and whatnot. You'll have
'em but listen to me son, don’t
disappoint me on this, or some
other guy will be putting their
cock up Little Miss Freud’s ass.

EXT. DOCK/WATERFRONT - CONTINUOUS

Costello hangs up and walks along and sees QUEENAN and DIGNAM step out.

QUEENAN
How are you, Francis?

COSTELLO
My mother called me Francis.

QUEENAN
I know she did. And your father

called you the tumor.

COSTELLO, not liking that:

COSTELLO
Oh, what did your father call you, Charlie? Oh yeah, I forgot, he wasn't around.

QUEENAN
Where are the real microprocessors,

Frank?
 






 
86.




COSTELLO
Microprocessors...oh yeah, I heard
that story. You arrested some
Chinese government guy at the
border carrying some light sockets

or somethin’.

DIGNAM
I can't wait to wipe that fuckin'

smirk off your face.

COSTELLO
(to Dignam)

Wouldn’t you rather wipe my ass for me?

QUEENAN
I will get you, Frank.

COSTELLO
If you could’ve you would’ve but I guess you like to go at your own pace.

From off-stage we hear a young, angelic GIRLS CHOIR begin to sing.

COSTELLO (CONT’D)
Excuse me, I’ve got a date with

some angels.

As Costello walks away:

QUEENAN
Sooner than you think, Francis.


INT. COLIN'S APARTMENT. CONTINUOUS

COLIN, looking worried, folding his phone away, comes into the apartment. MADOLYN is staring at him.

COLIN
What?

MADOLYN
You have a boss that has a

laryngectomy?

COLIN
No, no, no.	That was a guy who
works for me.
 




 
87.




MADOLYN
You're lying to me.

COLIN
Not exactly.
(the charming Colin:)

There are certain things I will not be able to talk to you about. I cannot allow you to jeopardize an ongoing investigation. (Or your own life.)
(more seriously, after a
long beat)
There really are things connected to my job that you can't ask about. That you don't want to know about.

MADOLYN
(after a beat)

Okay, then say that.

COLIN looks at her steadily: if she's serious, she's pure gold.

COLIN
I will.	Thank you.

He kisses her.	The DOORBELL RINGS.

MADOLYN
That's the movers.

COLIN
You still wanna stay?

MADOLYN
I do.

The doorbell safely ringing, Colin kisses Madolyn.

COLIN
(re: doorbell)

All right.	All right.	I'm coming.

INT. QUEENAN'S OFFICE. CONTINUOUS

DIGNAM is alone. We see Queenan's empty desk in a fall of light. We see Dignam's arm, wrist, phone, an expensive heavy watch.
 







 
88.




BILLY (O.S.)
I’m gonna get on a plane unless you put Queenan on the phone.

DIGNAM
Queenan had a funeral to go to.

This is my shift.	Calm down.

INT. IM PEI TYPE FOOTBRIDGE WITH A PEDESTRIAN CONVEYOR. DAY (INTERCUT)

BILLY is talking on the phone, in a fury.

BILLY
Why shouldn't I get on a fucking plane? Meet up? Do you actually want me dead? There's a rat in your unit. That's a fact. You just don't know it. Where's Queenan?

DIGNAM
He's not here.

BILLY
They knew you had cameras in the building. You have a leak from the inside. It's real. Smoke him out.

DIGNAM
And how do we do that Mr... fucking genius who didn’t even graduate the academy?

BILLY
Disinform. Let it slip to SIU that you're getting a sealed wiretap warrant for Costello's apartment. Don't tell anyone in our department but tell SIU. Flush it and see if it comes out of the pipe on my end. That's first. Narrow it down. Where's Queenan.

DIGNAM
Are you deaf? He’s not here. Call me when you get something real.

BILLY is in a full-on panic attack. He takes a pill, leans back against a wall, closes his eyes. The second phone rings. He stares at it: opens it.
 






 
89.




BILLY
It's me.

INT. DESERTED CAFE -	DAY

Madolyn and Billy sit at a table. Talking like friends now, emphatically non-clinical. Billy is zoned out, preoccupied, nervous.

MADOLYN
I’m assuming you want to change things, you know, change the people you know, change the people you meet, change everything, anything. Too many choices can see like no choice at all...

BILLY
Confucius say that?

MADOLYN
So you do...something radical.

BILLY
“Something radical,” huh?

MADOLYN
...yeah, you do... Sometimes it’s
just a matter of picking a thing

and doing it...

BILLY
So how long you been with this guy?

MADOLYN
Oh, four months. About four months.

BILLY
You love this guy?

MADOLYN
It’s pretty serious, yeah, it is.

BILLY
A head case or anything? I’m just curious...

MADOLYN
No more than I am.
 







 
90.




BILLY
Then you’re lucky. Considering the odds, right?

He lifts his cup to drink.

BILLY (CONT'D)
Good, give him a shot.

This may not be exactly what Madolyn wants to hear. But she nods.

MADOLYN
Doctors aren’t supposed to have

illusions.

BILLY
Yeah, that’s because of vastly
superior intelligence.	Godlike,

really.

Smiles, called on her shit.

MADOLYN
OK, I’m in a serious, newly
serious, relationship...there
are...ups and downs...everybody has

doubts, problems -- I mean doubts.

She realizes she may have glazed and gone a little too far on “problems”.

BILLY
What would you do if he was

standing right there and saw us?

MADOLYN
I’d lie. To keep things on an even keel. You know all about it.

INT./EXT. BANKROBBER'S APARTMENT. CHARLESTOWN. DAY

The BANKROBBER, a junkie, wakes up to a vision: JESUS, indicating the sacred heart.

BILLY smashes the glass and the frame over the guy's head.

CUT TO OUTSIDE:

MISTER FRENCH has lit a cherry-bomb. He throws it. He hands out fireworks to KIDS.
 





 
91.




BACK INSIDE:

BILLY shoves him down on the couch and crams the gun to his head.

BILLY
You take off an armored car at the Dedham Mall and what do you do. Do you pay guineas in Providence?

BANKROBBER
Fucking now I do.

BILLY
What the fuck do you do.

BANKROBBER
What, I pay Costello and wait for
him to trade me to the FBI? Cause

that's what he does.

BILLY
FBI? What the fuck are you talking about.

{Firecrackers off}

BANKROBBER
Oh my God, is that French out

there?

BILLY
(grabbing him by the
shirt)
What the fuck did you just say

about the FBI?

BANKROBBER
Forget what I said. I’m fucking

high, I’m high.

Firecrackers continue to go off outside. The BANKROBBER knows what this means.

BILLY
Whatever’s going through your very poor, very limited, brain...I’m not going to hurt you. Just tell me what you just fucking said.
 







 
92.

 (2)


BANKROBBER
Forget it, I’m high, I must be
high, I would never say what you

thought I said.

As the firecracker sounds increase outside (Maybe French's “Do what you have to do”), BILLY, no way out of what he has to do, glances at the window, shoots the guy through the kneecap. BLOOD sprays everywhere. The bankrobber screams.

BILLY
Tell me what the fuck you said.

BANKROBBER
(covered with blood)

Why do you think he's not arrested? Costello's a protected FBI informant. He'll trade you out.
(a beat)
I thought I was supposed to go into shock. I’m not in shock. It fucking hurts. It fucking hurts.

BILLY gets out of the house.

OUTSIDE

MISTER FRENCH is benignly watching kids light cherry bombs.

BILLY
Let's go.

ON SOUND: Sextet from LUCIA di LAMMAMOOR.

INT. A THEATER. NIGHT

From behind COSTELLO'S HEAD, which almost fills the frame, we see a blur of beautiful color. ON STAGE, an opera is in progress——LUCIA DI LAMMAMOOR done with masks. CUT TO COSTELLO, revealing Costello's rapt face and PAN to reveal on his Left a beautiful WHITE PROSTITUTE. PAN back over COSTELLO'S face to reveal a beautiful BLACK PROSTITUTE. PERFORMERS with MASKS sing on stage. As the music soars, COSTELLO moves crinolines up the women's legs.

INT. A BEDROOM. NIGHT.

COSTELLO fucks...and fucks weird.

EXT. QUEENAN'S HOUSE IN WEST ROXBURY. NIGHT

A street of three-deckers. QUEENAN gets out of his unmarked cruiser. As he does: BILLY steps out into the light. The two men stare at each other, each lit by their own streetlight.

BILLY
Hey, it's me.

QUEENAN
What do you want?	What are you
doing here?

BILLY
Come here.

QUEENAN approaches him.

BILLY (CONT'D)
Costello is giving people up to the

FBI.

QUEENAN stares.

QUEENAN
The FBI?

BILLY
He gives information to the FBI. He's a protected informant. Aren't they trying to make it a Federal case? And it never gets made?

QUEENAN
(realizing he has to be
very careful)

Go around the back. Go around the back.

INT. QUEENAN'S HOUSE. MOMENTS LATER

BILLY sits on a bench in a hallway, exhausted, staring. THE SACRED HEART and JFK are on the walls. QUEENAN comes along the hall.

QUEENAN
My wife's asleep. She left supper
out. Come and have something to

eat.

BILLY shakes his head.
 





 
94.




BILLY
No, I...

QUEENAN
We'll talk in the kitchen. Come and have something to eat.

BILLY follows him towards the lighted kitchen door.

EXT. DRIVING RANGE. DAY (WINDY)

COLIN is watching ELLERBY hit golf balls. Well.

ELLERBY
Congratulations. Haven't seen a guy
like you since me. You'll be
transferred to Internal
Investigations but you will
continue to work right where you
are in the Special Investigation
Unit.

COLIN
I don't get it.

ELLERBY
We are all convinced that Costello has at least one mole in the Special Investigation Unit.

COLIN
Right.

ELLERBY
You'll investigate. Everybody.

Anybody.

COLIN
Well, that's just a dream job for a cop.

ELLERBY
We have considered all possible candidates. You have an immaculate record. Some people never trust a guy with an immaculate record. I do.
(a beat)
I have an immaculate record.

ELLERBY hits a drive.
 





 
95.




ELLERBY (CONT'D)
Play golf?

COLIN
No.

ELLERBY
That's a pity. Pretty much sucks as a game but you get to form relationships.
(a beat)

How's the wedding coming along?

COLIN
Everything's great. On schedule.

She's a doctor.

ELLERBY
Outstanding. That's good. Marriage is an important part of getting ahead. You don't want anyone thinking you're a homo. Married guy seems stable. People look at a wedding ring and think: someone can stand the son of a bitch. Ladies see the wedding ring and know immediately that you must have some cash and that your cock works.

COLIN
Oh, it's working. Overtime.

ELLERBY
I'm glad to hear that.

Hits a drive. Ponk.

EXT. CONSTRUCTION AREA. DAY

HEAVY EQUIPMENT stands on the thrashed earth. Hoardings. BILLY crosses the road under what remains of the Expressway, and after hiding in an angle of the building and cocking the gun in his pocket bangs on the door of a dead bar. The door is unlocked by: DELAHUNT.

INT. THE DEAD BAR. DAY

It's another of COSTELLO'S "locations". BILLY looks around. Every man from the previous night is there--but no COSTELLO. DELAHUNT closes the door behind him and bars it. Men are oddly enough filling out forms. These are not men used to pencil and paper. Billy is nodded at.
 



 
96.




MISTER FRENCH
Boss wants your real name, your
social, your license number, all

your bank account numbers.

BILLY
I don't have a bank account.

MISTER FRENCH
I'm a cash business myself.

BILLY
What's he doing, setting up IRAs?

MISTER FRENCH
You fill in the papers, real name, all your numbers, no fucking around, and then we all wait here.

MISTER FRENCH (CONT'D)
No, I ain't.

MISTER FRENCH goes off into a separate room. BILLY takes a paper and, sitting at the bar beside FITZY, writes down his information. The other men are mostly finished and DELAHUNT is collecting the papers. DELAHUNT tosses the brown envelope on the bar.

DELAHUNT
Put the forms in there.

FITZY
I don't know if this is how you

spell Citizens'.

BILLY glances at what FITZY is crawling: CITTIZINS TRUST.

BILLY
No, no, no. Jesus Christ.

He takes the brown envelope, and writes on it CITIZENS.

FITZY
What are you, retarded? That ain't right.

BILLY gives up. Both of their forms are stuffed in an envelope. BILLY gets up.

DELAHUNT
Billy, he said to stay here.
 





 
97.

 (2)


BILLY
I'm not sitting in this room
without a tetanus shot. I'm not

staying.

MISTER FRENCH
Where you going?

BILLY goes out. DELAHUNT puts his coat on. He picks up the brown envelope on which CITIZENS TRUST is written.

EXT. THE WATERFRONT. DAY

BILLY is holding his bottle of tranqs. He traces with his finger the doctor's name...MADOLYN MADDEN. His "police" phone vibrates and he takes it out.

ONSCREEN
Follow the envelope.

BILLY deletes the IM and dials Queenan directly.

BILLY
Why can't Ellerby's guys? SIU.

INT. QUEENAN'S OFFICE. DAY

QUEENAN closes his door.

QUEENAN
They can't.	They are compromised.

EXT. COSTELLO'S APARTMENT. NIGHT

Costello emerges, in an overcoat. Carrying the envelope. He gets into his Oldsmobile. BILLY starts his car and follows.

INT. CINEMA. NIGHT	REVISED ON SET 5/31/05

Dark theater, movie in progress. Wobbly porno music. A thin audience of raincoat artists. The door opens and COSTELLO enters. He moves slowly down the aisle and sees: COLIN sitting alone. He sits down in front of COLIN.

Costello is wearing the dildo. He watches the movie, moaning.

COSTELLO
Oh yeah, be dirty.

Colin goes for his gun. Costello gets up, shows him the dildo.
 



 
98.




COSTELLO (CONT'D)
See	anything you like?

COLIN unnerved, recognizing COSTELLO now.

COLIN
Jesus Christ, Frank, I almost shot you.

Frank sits, closer to Colin.

COSTELLO
You're not indulging in self abuse are you?

COLIN
Frank, we got problems.

COSTELLO
I hope you’re not turning into one of those sob sisters, who wants to get caught. You’re not crackin’ up are you?

COLIN
I don’t crack up.

COSTELLO
Pick a place where any cop could

see you...

COLIN
Why did you show up then?

COSTELLO
I own the place.

COLIN
Why am I not fuckin' surprised.

Look...

COSTELLO
You're gettin' reassigned.

COLIN
How the fuck did you know that?

COSTELLO
Where’d they put you?

COLIN
I have to find myself.
 




 
99.

 (2)


COSTELLO chuckles, truly enjoying this.

COSTELLO
You’re telling me, sonny boy.

COLIN
I have to find the guy you have in the department.

COSTELLO
With everybody looking up their own ass and you looking for yourself, I put my money on nobody finding nothing.

We see in Colin's face hurt and hatred for Costello. His idol doesn't like him.

COLIN
Frank, for me, you've got to lay

low.

COSTELLO
Laying low is not what I do.

COLIN
Yeah, big fuckin' daddy Frank. Lookit, Frank, what good am I to you if you don't listen to me? Queenan's compartmentalizing. He's fuckin' smart, you know that. I will find this rat if you let me do it my way. If you let me do my job.

COSTELLO
Okay.
(gives him the envelope)

But Colin, I hope I won’t have to remind you, that if you don’t find that cheese eating rat bastard in your department so we can give him a halo, most likely it won’t be me who pays for it.

COLIN nods, sweat on his lip.

COLIN
Why would you need to remind me of that? I didn't know that would I be any good at what I do? Trust me, I know how to do this.
(MORE)
 



 
100.

 (3)
COLIN (CONT'D)
It involves lying, and I'm pretty

fucking good at that, right?

COSTELLO
(looking at the screen)

Maybe it's because it's always been so easy for me to get cunt that I never understood jerking off in a theatre.

Costello gets up to go.

COSTELLO (CONT'D)
Who knows what's easy?	Collie,
take care of business.

The door opens again at the back of the theater and we see: BILLY in a dark back seat. COSTELLO, after hesitating as Colin sweats, shoves the brown envelope to COLIN, and goes.

BILLY receives a text message: "Get visual ID suspect." He slumps in his seat as Costello marches up the aisle and out of the theater. He has barely recovered from this when:

The dark shape of COLIN is moving rapidly towards and through the emergency exit beside the screen.

Billy follows.

INT. CINEMA BACK STAIRCASE AND ALLEY. NIGHT

It's open, and gives on to what Boston keeps trying to call the Theater District and what keeps being The Combat Zone. COLIN vanishes around a corner. BILLY follows, looks left and right, then goes after

EXT. A STREET OF CHINESE SHOPS. CONTINUOUS

COLIN, who is walking along, putting the envelope into his coat.

BILLY is speeding up, moving through pedestrians, desperate to see Colin's face.

COLIN will be caught up to within seconds. He turns down another street. BILLY starts into a half-run. He turns the corner.

ANOTHER STREET painted with neon light (quiet).

BILLY'S POV:

COLIN is halfway down the street.
 




 
101.




BILLY follows.

BILLY is nearly up to COLIN on this quieter street

(And COLIN is aware of the tail)

when...

BILLY'S cellphone rings. His phone has fucked up, as they do. Instead of turning around, COLIN accelerates. The only thing on his agenda is to not have his face seen.

BILLY spins into a door-opening and silences the ringer.

TEXT MESSAGE DETAIL
Make arrest.

COLIN takes a right at the end of the street, into an alley.

EXT. AROUND THE NEXT CORNER. MOMENTS LATER

COLIN is waiting, in a doorway of his own. He has a knife open in his hand. He waits, listening to (faltering) footsteps: a MAN, face invisible in shadow, turns the corner. COLIN pulls him into the doorway and rips upwards with a knife.

As the body falls we see: it isn't Billy. It's a CHINESE MAN.
COLIN backs away in horror, and hurries off down the street.

EXT. ANOTHER STREET. MOMENTS LATER

COLIN, sweating, staggering, hurries along. No sign of Billy, no sign of a follower. But he does notice: CCTV cameras at the intersection. He spins and gets out of there, heading off through. CHINATOWN. Colin, holding his envelope, walks, sweating, fast, then faster, past repeated ideograms in neon (the ideograms say--flash--"Departed").

EXT. CHINATOWN. MOMENTS LATER

BILLY has lost Colin. He hears a hubbub from the corner where a small crowd of Chinese speakers is gathering and pushes through the crowd to see: blood running on the pavement. BILLY backs away, gets out of there.

INT. CCTV ROOM. NIGHT

COLIN is looking at CCTV tapes. We see COLIN, unrecognizable on cheap video. Then we see a blurred image of BILLY. Crossing the street in beats. No more use as ID than the Shroud of Turin.
 
102.



EXT. MADOLYN'S CELLAR APARTMENT. NIGHT (RAINING)

Through grated windows we can see Madolyn finishing up her packing. BILLY KNOCKS on the door, which leads only into Madolyn's basement apartment. A long beat and she opens the door. The chain on.

BILLY
Your name's on the pill label. I thought you weren't supposed to be in the book, in case of obsessive patients.

MADOLYN
How obsessive are you?

BILLY
Medium.

MADOLYN
Are you okay?	Why are you here?

BILLY
I really liked our conversations.
I've been...regretting that we
didn't continue...our

conversations.

MADOLYN
I'm glad you want to see me...it's nice to see you...I enjoyed talking...I enjoyed having coffee with you, very much...but I don't see people...I don't see people in my home.

Billy gets soaked.

INT. MADOLYN'S CELLAR APARTMENT. CONTINUOUS

BILLY looks around and sees: boxes, transition. The furniture already gone. An air-mattress on the floor. There are still tea things on the counter. A basic life is still possible here. Madolyn has been making tea here, sleeping here, reading in bed. Billy, soaked, a drowned rat, is looking vulnerable and honest.

BILLY
Thanks. If this is inappropriate...

I can leave.

MADOLYN takes a moment to react.
 




 
103.




MADOLYN
No, it's, it’s, it’s not
inappropriate...you’re not a

patient...

BILLY
You moving in or out?

MADOLYN
I still have three weeks on the

lease...

BILLY is looking at THE PICTURE to which Colin objected. A young girl in front of a rust belt slum, tilted in a box of effects.

MADOLYN (CONT'D)
That's me.

BILLY
Yeah, I know.

He hangs the picture on a nail.

MADOLYN
(the kettle whistles OS)

Would you like a cup of tea?

BILLY nods.

BILLY
Yeah. Yeah I would. Thank you.

Madolyn leaves him looking vaguely around the apartment. In the kitchen, it appears that Madolyn has forgotten how to make a cup of tea. She perseveres, comes out holding two cups. Billy is looking at the handful of books still in the apartment.

MADOLYN
Do you want some...

BILLY
Sugar?	No...

She hands him the cup of tea. Strung out, he spills his tea, slightly, unobserved by Madolyn. Madolyn looks over at the bed, the book, the lamp, the incontrovertible evidence that she's probably really, in fact, not that into Colin..

MADOLYN
I've always needed my own place.
 




 
104.

 (2)


BILLY
Hedging your bets?

MADOLYN
No. I'm not "hedging my best"...I
told you when we had
coffee...There's a choice. You

choose...you have to make a...

BILLY
Decision.

MADOLYN
...decision...and stick by

what...you choose...you have to...

BILLY
Move in with your boyfriend?

MADOLYN
Yes. Stick by what you...otherwise it's... I have to say that your vulnerability is really freaking me out right now. Is it real?

BILLY
Yeah, I think so.

Tick...tick...tick.

BILLY (CONT'D)
You don’t have cats.

MADOLYN
No.

BILLY
I like that.	That's good.

INT. CCTV ROOM. NIGHT

Colin is still studying the blurry image of Billy.

INT. MADOLYN'S BASEMENT APARTMENT. NIGHT

In the tiny kitchen BILLY is kissing MADOLYN and unbuttoning her shirt. Her hands start to move to push him away. He continues.
 
105.



INT. CCTV ROOM. NIGHT

Still studying the blurry image of Billy, COLIN tenses as someone comes into the office and switches off the tape. He glances at his coat. The envelope is visible folded into the breast pocket. He takes his coat and goes.

EXT. CHARLES STREET. NIGHT

Wet empty streets. The "gaslights" are on. About midnight.

INT. CHARLES STREET BRASSERIE. NIGHT

A Costello business. The restaurant is closed for the night. One bartender is sweeping up and the other is counting the takings. In a darker alcove of the bar COSTELLO sits alone at a broad table, drinking brandy. On sound, classical music. As a knocking is heard Costello looks up. A BARTENDER lets Billy in. COSTELLO watches Billy approach. We hear him sit down.
