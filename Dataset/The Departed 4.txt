COSTELLO
You got a girlfriend?

BILLY
No.	No.	What does that matter?

COSTELLO
Depends. I'm sure you know by now there's an informer in my crew. Cop. Staties or Boston Police department, I'm not sure.

He pours Billy some brandy. Then starts to draw a sketch.

BILLY
What about the FBI.

COSTELLO
It ain't. Trust me.	The ex-wife,
an old friend or stupid...that's
what brings you down in this

business.

BILLY
Stupid...Well, that leaves me out.

COSTELLO
Past days, case like this...I killed everybody who works for me.

BILLY
Better safe than sorry, I suppose.
 




 
106.




COSTELLO
On the other hand, back then, it
was only five...or six...and

French.

But COSTELLO, maybe, is sorry.

BILLY
I look around at your guys. They're all murderers right? I think "could I do murder?" And all I can answer myself is, "what's the difference".

COSTELLO
Give em up to the Almighty.	Like
that.

BILLY
Yeah, that's my point. You accuse
me once, I put up with it. You
accuse me twice, I quit. If you
make me fear for my life, I put a
fucking bullet in your head as if
you were anybody else.

COSTELLO looks up. This is new: but he's impassive. And impressed.

COSTELLO
(to Billy)
You got something you want to say

to me, William?

BILLY
You're seventy fucking years old. One of these guys is going to pop you. As for running drugs, what the fuck. You don't need the pain in the ass, and they're going to catch you. And you don't need the money.

COSTELLO smiles, and continues with the sketch. Later he will light up the paper.

COSTELLO
I haven't needed "the money" since I took Archie's milk money in the third grade. Tell the truth, I don't need pussy any more,but I still like it.

(MORE)
 



 
107.

 (2)
COSTELLO (CONT'D)
Point I'm making...you see...I got
this rat...gnawing, cheese eating
fucking rat...questions come
up...questions...see, Bill, you're
the new guy...and the girlfriend.
Why don't you stay in the bar when
I get the numbers. Your numbers.

Everybody's numbers.

BILLY
Is there something you want to ask me, Frank?

COSTELLO
Start with, you agree there is a

rat?

BILLY
You said there is one. I base most of what I do on the idea that you're pretty fucking good at what you do.

COSTELLO
Sure, sure, all that aside...but

you Bill, what would you do?

COSTELLO sketching.

BILLY
How many of these guys been with you long enough to be disgruntled? Who needs more money than you pay them? You don't pay much, you know. It's almost a feudal fuckin' enterprise.
(COSTELLO nods, accepting
this)
The question is, who thinks that
they would do what you do better

than you?

COSTELLO
Only one that can do what I do is

me.	You want to be me?

BILLY stares over a precipice: he knows this as well.

BILLY
I probably could be you. I know
that much. But I don’t want to be

you.
 





 
108.

COSTELLO
Heavy lies the crown...sort of

thing.

FRENCH comes in from the kitchen.

MISTER FRENCH
Francis.

BARTENDER
We're out of here, Mister Costello.

You'll have to set the alarm.

COSTELLO
(eyes on Billy)

Thank you, Jimmy. See you tomorrow.

ON SOUND the door closes and locks.

COSTELLO (CONT’D)
There's a boat coming in, up in
Gloucester. French will give you

all the details.

COSTELLO leaves.

INT. COSTELLO'S KITCHEN. DAY/INTERCUT: INT. COLIN'S OFFICE

COSTELLO is on the phone. MISTER FRENCH is sitting on a stool, smoking. OPERA playing on sound.

COSTELLO
You heard nothing?

COLIN
No.

COSTELLO
Nothing about drugs. Nothing about new guys, nothing about Gloucester?

COLIN
No, Frank, not a thing.	And I
promise you I would have heard

about it.

COSTELLO hangs up and turns to MISTER FRENCH.

COSTELLO
You’re sure. No other departments, no codes, like that...
 





 
109.




COLIN’S VOICE
Frank.	You can relax on this one.

COSTELLO
Okay, Collie.	I will.

Costello hangs up and turns to Mr. French.

COSTELLO (CONT’D)
(emotionally)
It ain’t Bill.	No way, he says.

Thank God for Billy.

INT. POLICE HEADQUARTERS. DAY

Everybody is busy in the office. It's COLIN's first day of Internal Investigations. COLIN'S moving through the bullpen. COPS stare at him with resentment.

COLIN
Morning.

He comes up to Queenan's door just as Dignam comes out.
DIGNAM faces COLIN down.

COLIN (CONT'D)
A problem?

DIGNAM
Yeah, I run rat fucks like you. I don't like them.

COLIN
The day you wouldn't take a promotion, you let me know. And I wouldn't even have a job if you did yours.

DIGNAM
Fuck yourself.

COLIN
I need to know the identity of your undercovers.

DIGNAM
Blow me. Not literally, there’s no promotion in it for ya.

He walks away.

COLIN goes into Queenan's office.
 
110.



INT. QUEENAN'S OFFICE. MOMENTS LATER

QUEENAN puts the cig into a cup of water, and throws it into the trash.

COLIN
Morning, Captain.

QUEENAN
Look who’s here. The Queen of the prom.

COLIN
They are not happy with me.

Especially Staff Sergeant Dignam.

QUEENAN
What do you expect? Everybody knows you're assigned here to find Costello's rat. They want to find the leak as much as you do. What they do not want is to be accused of being the rat.

COLIN sits uneasily.

COLIN
Fair enough. Well one of them has to be dirty, We know that, right?

QUEENAN
Two days ago, my undercover guy in

Costello's organization——

COLIN
Who is that?

QUEENAN
Lots of luck. (Not a chance.) You can go over my head, high as you like. You still won't get an answer.

COLIN
Fair enough.

QUEENAN
As I said, two days ago, my guy nearly found out who Costello's rat is. He lost him in the street.
 






 
111.




COLIN
Really?	Did he get a look at him?

QUEENAN
...No.

COLIN
Nothing that could help us?

QUEENAN
Nah.

COLIN
(swallows)

(Too bad.) Any advice?	Generally?

QUEENAN
Costello can't do (much) business
without coordinating with his
source...
(gestures out window)
Who is here.	In SIU.	Follow
Costello and you'll find his rat.

COLIN realizes: Just follow Queenan and you'll find his rat.

QUEENAN (CONT'D)
(turns away)

You're going to be looking at my people. Going through their bank statements, phone bills, medical records. Don't expect them to get you a coffee or invite you to their houses. Let me get you a coffee.

INT. COLIN'S OFFICE #2. DAY

COLIN is sitting in his office alone, remembering what
Queenan has just told him:

QUEENAN (V.O.)
Follow Costello and you'll find his informer.

In the fishbowl of his glass office, COLIN is being stared at by pissed-off cops. COLIN calms down. He opens the gray envelope. He takes out the forms that he was given by Costello, opens up POLICE PERSONNEL DATABASE and starts searching. He types in SS numbers. One, then another, then another. The result is always: "Person not found". He types in Costigan, William M, hits return. It comes up: "Person not found". COLIN keeps working.
 
112.



INT. COLIN'S OFFICE #2. LATER

MUGSHOTS of all of Costello's guys. He looks at them desperately...no one squares up with the blurred, impossible, images he saw on the CCTV screen (which he has printed out).COLIN closes the curtains on his fishbowl office (not fast enough to avoid seeing Dignam give him the finger), locks his door. He picks up the phone.

VOICE ON PHONE (V.O.)
Internal Investigations.

COLIN
This is Sullivan. I need constant
surveillance on Captain Queenan,

starting right now.

INT. COLIN AND MADOLYN’S NEW BEDROOM.	SAME NIGHT

COLIN is lying in bed, his back to MADOLYN.

COLIN
If I wasn't with the Mass State Police. If I did it full time,law school, I'd be through in a year. I'm thinking that. If I wasn't a trooper.

MADOLYN
What's going on?

COLIN
Nothing. Nothing. There's nothing going on. Just thinking.

MADOLYN
Okay, all right.
(thinking about it; blows
a breath)

And what about money?

COLIN
I got some money.	Another
city...I'm thinking that.

Another city doesn't seem unattractive to Madolyn, who's in her own cut-and-run crisis -- but maybe she can't believe that Colin is thinking about it. She blows a breath.

MADOLYN
Another city?	It'd be a clean
slate.
 




 
113.




COLIN is in hell.	He looks at her intensely.

COLIN
I want you to know you don’t gotta stay. If we're not going to make it, it's got to be you that gets out. I'm not capable
(a beat)
I’m fuckin’ Irish, so I’ll deal with something being wrong for the rest of my life.

Long pause.

MADOLYN
Not a bad idea, another city.

EXT. THE CHARLES STREET BRASSERIE. DAY

FITZY and DELAHUNT are smoking on the sidewalk outside the restaurant.

DELAHUNT
Of course I know how to spot a cop.

FITZY
Oh yeah, how's that?

DELAHUNT
If he's not paying attention to us, he's a cop.

THEIR POV:

A MAN across the street is looking into the window of an antique shop.

DELAHUNT (CONT'D)
See that guy over there, he's a
cop. He's not paying attention to

us. He's a cop.

FITZY
Lot of fucking cops.

A WOMAN walks by definitely ignoring both men, dragging a lapdog.

FITZY (CONT'D)
What kind of dog is that?

No response.
 




 
114.




FITZY (CONT'D)
She's a cop.

DELAHUNT
She's probably the fucking Police

Commissioner.

INT. CHARLES STREET BRASSERIE. CONTINUOUS

Too early to be opened for business. COSTELLO and NEW GUYS, six hard customers, come in through the fire door. At the BAR, BILLY is drinking coffee. He notices the NEW GUYS. Off the boat Dublin toughs. COSTELLO and FRENCH come in from the kitchen. FRENCH tells the NEW GUYS to move to the back. COSTELLO HAS BLOOD ON HIS SLEEVES. He comes over to the bar and looks at BILLY.

COSTELLO
You can get out of here.	This is
the crew for tonight.

BILLY
I thought I was on for that.

COSTELLO
I changed my mind. Take the night off.
(to Bartender)

Jimmy, get the mop.

COSTELLO heads to the back of the restaurant. MISTER FRENCH, grabs the BAR KNIFE from behind the bar. BILLY looks up at him.

MISTER FRENCH
Go out the back. Some guys answer the questions right. Some don’t.

MISTER FRENCH goes towards the back of the restaurant, holding the big knife. BILLY closes his paper.

EXT. THE CHARLES STREET BRASSERIE. MOMENTS LATER

BILLY steps out, ignoring DELAHUNT and FITZY.

DELAHUNT
You're a cop.

BILLY
Huh?
 






 
115.




DELAHUNT
You're ignoring us. You're a cop.
We're guessing who cops are. Most

good looking women are cops.

BILLY
Right. I'm going home. He's playing with his new boys.

DELAHUNT
See you later.

BILLY
Later.

BILLY walks down the street and heads into an alley. Around the corner, he opens his phone.

BILLY (CONT'D)
He's moving something with all new guys. (A whole new crew.) I don't want to tell you what or where. It might be disinformation. It probably is. Just keep following him. I need to see you today.
(a beat...reacting to
Queenan, Billy continues)
No. Today.

EXT. POLICE STATION/COLIN'S OFFICE. DAY

A DETECTIVE (DETECTIVE 1) is leading the team to trail after Queenan. On foot. A plug in his ear. Two other DETECTIVES sit in a sedan nearby. (These three detectives are new guys, never seen before, the I.I. surveillance team working for Colin).

DETECTIVE 1
Can I ask a question, Sergeant?

COLIN
Yes, go ahead.

DETECTIVE 2
Why the fuck are we following Captain Queenan? To find out about the good Catholic life?
 









 
116.




COLIN
(angrily)
I have to follow every lead,
however unlikely, however fucking
painful it might be to your

delicate fucking sensibilities.

DETECTIVE 1
Who says I have delicate

sensibilities?

COLIN
I have reason to believe that
Queenan is Costello's informer.

Follow him, and don't get made.

DETECTIVE 1
Copy that, Sarge

The detectives in the car get alert and start their car as QUEENAN comes out of the building.

DETECTIVE 1 (CONT'D)
We got him.

DETECTIVE 2
Sarge, we got the target.

EXT. TREMONT STREET/FINANCIAL DISTRICT. DAY

DETECTIVE 1 trails Captain Queenan through the crowds of people heading towards work.

INT. PARK ST. SUBWAY STATION. MORNING

QUEENAN begins to light a cigarette and then gives it up. A TRAIN comes in, and Queenan boards. DETECTIVE 1 boards the next car.

INT. DETECTIVE 1'S SUBWAY CAR. MOMENTS LATER

Looking through smeared glass into the next car as the train begins to move DETECTIVE 1 sees QUEENAN answer a cell call.

INT. QUEENAN'S SUBWAY CAR. CONTINUOUS

QUEENAN is on his cell.

QUEENAN
Where are you now?
 






 
117.




BILLY
Look down the car.

QUEENAN looks up mildly as the car rocks.

BILLY (CONT’D)
Got me?

QUEENAN'S POV:

BILLY is slumped in a seat at the far end, not looking towards QUEENAN.

BILLY (CONT'D)
Any reason you'd have a tail?

QUEENAN
No...Of course not.

BILLY
(on the verge of
hyperventilating)

I’m watching a guy...

QUEENAN
I don’t have a tail, Billy.

Through the glass we see DETECTIVE 1 watching Queenan.

BILLY
Okay. Get off at South Station. You wait there for ten minutes. After I leave I’ll text message you the address where we’ll meet. I’ll make sure you don’t have a tail.

QUEENAN
South Station.	Wait ten minutes.

As the train stops BILLY vaults off of it. On the platform he walks along, texting.

EXT. SOUTH STATION SUBWAY EXIT. LATE MORNING

QUEENAN, mild in his specs, chewing gum with his dentures, comes out of the station, and looks at the TEXT MESSAGE on his phone.
 
118.



EXT. A STREET SOUTH OF FT. POINT CHANNEL. MOMENTS LATER

A building under rehab, covered with scaffolding, but still functioning as a corporate building. QUEENAN goes along to the entrance, and in.

DETECTIVE 1 comes along after him. We see the Internal Investigations car up the street. DETECTIVE 1 dials his cellphone.

DETECTIVE 1
He went into a building on the waterfront. Address is 344 Wash...

INT. THE LOBBY. MOMENTS LATER

DETECTIVE 1 looks at the elevator-indicator, and the building directory.

DETECTIVE 1
He went to the top floor. It's

empty. No tenants.

INT. COLIN'S OFFICE #2. CONTINUOUS

COLIN, listening, playing with a COIN.

EXT. COMMERCIAL BUILDING. MOMENTS LATER

DETECTIVE 1 emerges from the building and joins other detectives in the car.

DETECTIVE 1

INT. COLIN'S OFFICE #2/BRASSERIE. CONTINUOUS

COLIN, after fumbling between cell phones, dials the correct one.

COLIN
(to COSTELLO)
I think I've got him.	I think
Queenan is meeting with him right

now.

EXT. CHARLES STREET BRASSERIE. MOMENTS LATER

FITZY and DELAHUNT'S phones ring simultaneously.

DELAHUNT
Get the van. Get the boys.
 
119.



EXT. COMMERCIAL BUILDING ROOFTOP. CONTINUOUS

BILLY is waiting on the roof as QUEENAN finally arrives.

QUEENAN
I assume these premises do not have an anti-smoking ordinance. So, what’s going on?

BILLY
I told you, he’s got dope coming
in, I don’t know where.	He’s

getting spooky, Captain...

QUEENAN
What do you mean?

BILLY
He’s crazy. I just saw the man. He had blood all over him. I can’t get any more information for you. I can’t trust it. He’s not including his regular guys... I’m telling you, he’s gonna find out who I am. He's gonna fuckin' kill me, I know it.

QUEENAN
All right, all right. I hear you. I'm sorry for you trouble. Look, I’m not gonna jeopardize your safety any longer. I’ll get you out. I can’t do it overnight but I’ll do it. We can bust him for what we have. At least I think we can...I hope. You’re out of there ASAP.

BILLY nods, and nods.

BILLY
Yeah?	What about the FBI?

QUEENAN
They’re compromised.

BILLY
What?

QUEENAN
They’re fucked, just like this

lighter.
 




 
120.




BILLY’S phone rings.

INT. FITZY'S VAN. CONTINUOUS

DELAHUNT is calling Billy from a van crowded with Costello's usual bad guys as it scorches through traffic.

DELAHUNT
Billy, where the fuck are you? We been trying to reach you. We found the rat. Top man says we're gonna take care of him. The address is 314 Washington Street. You got it? All right. See you there.

EXT. COMMERCIAL BUILDING ROOFTOP. CONTINUOUS

BILLY listens in horror, staring at the oblivious QUEENAN.

QUEENAN
What?

BILLY
You were fucking followed.

QUEENAN
By who?

BILLY
Costello’s people.

QUEENAN
Impossible.

BILLY
No. One of the cops he’s got inside tipped him.

QUEENAN realizes that his enemy might be...

INT. COLIN'S OFFICE #2. CONTINUOUS

COLIN raises his eyes. Diabolical.

EXT. COMMERCIAL BUILDING. MOMENTS LATER

FITZY'S VAN stops outside the building. COSTELLO'S MEN get out of the van, and head into the lobby.

INT. INTERNAL INVESTIGATIONS CAR. CONTINUOUS

The DETECTIVES are watching.

INT. COLIN'S OFFICE #2. CONTINUOUS

COLIN listens.

COLIN
Yes.

INT. STAIRCASE. DAY

Billy and Queenan are running downstairs when they hear footsteps coming up from below. They immediately go back up to the elevator lobby. Pushing through plastic sheeting.

INT. LOBBY ON THE TOP FLOOR. CONTINUOUS

Billy is slamming elevator buttons. The indicator shows both elevators coming up.

BILLY
They'll be on the elevators, too.

QUEENAN
Take the back fire escape.

BILLY
What’ll you do?

QUEENAN
I’ll be fine. If you get made I can't protect you. Go down the fire escape. Now. That’s an order. I’ll be fine.

BILLY goes. Queenan waits. Watching the elevator indicator. QUEENAN, in his specs, very mild, takes out his gun and breaks the cylinder, checking that it is loaded, and putting a shell into the empty sixth chamber.

EXT. FIRE ESCAPE. MOMENTS LATER

BILLY climbs out onto the fire escape at the back of the building and starts dropping down, fast.
 
122.



INT. THE TOP FLOOR LOBBY. DAY

The elevator door opens, revealing DELAHUNT and BOYS. QUEENAN looks right as the door to the staircase opens revealing FITZY and boys.

QUEENAN
Can I help you gentlemen?

FITZY
I guess we've had enough of this

shit. Where's your boy?

QUEENAN doesn't answer, and never will. He draws his gun and is tackled.

EXT. BACK ALLEY, COMMERCIAL BUILDING. DAY

BILLY drops off the fire escape and runs down the alley.

EXT. COMMERCIAL BUILDING. MOMENTS LATER

BILLY towards the front doors just as--

QUEENAN'S BODY bounces off the scaffolding, smashes into the pavement and explodes. BLOOD splashes all over BILLY.

INT. INTERNAL INVESTIGATIONS CAR. CONTINUOUS

DETECTIVE 1 screams into his headset.

What came off the roof?	What do
you mean something came off the
roof?	Go again with that
information.

EXT. THE COMMERCIAL BUILDING. CONTINUOUS

FITZY, DELAHUNT and boys come out. The crew has seen the UNMARKED COP CAR. FITZY grabs BILLY.

FITZY
You're fuckin' late. Where the fuck were you? Get in the fuckin' van.
 







 
123.




BILLY
What the fuck happened? I came to meet you.

They start piling into a van.

INT. THE INTERNAL INVESTIGATIONS CAR. CONTINUOUS

DETECTIVE 2 is yelling both at his partner and into the mic.

DETECTIVE 1
Stay in the fucking car. Stay in
the fucking car. This is a
surveillance unit.
(into mic to Colin)

Do I pursue.

INT. COLIN'S OFFICE #2. CONTINUOUS

COLIN is sitting very calmly.

COLIN
No.	Stay where you are.	I need
some fucking information here.

What came off the building?

DETECTIVE 1
I'm not sure.

INT./EXT. INTERNAL INVESTIGATIONS CAR/ THE STREET. CONTINUOUS

DETECTIVE 1
No pursuit.	No pursuit.

DETECTIVE 1 (CONT'D)
Fuck that.

DETECTIVE 1 gets out of the car and runs towards the fleeing men, gun drawn.

FITZY turns on DETECTIVE 1 with a pistol drawn. DETECTIVE 1 fires and DELAHUNT is hit in the stomach. FITZY shoots the detective (he is wounded in the hand, not killed). The VAN takes off.

DETECTIVE 4
Thirty-two X to CP.	Thirty-two X
to CP.	We're being fired upon. I
repeat.
 
124.



INT. COLIN'S OFFICE #2. CONTINUOUS

ON RADIO. "Officer down", etc. COLIN has never felt more guilty in his life.

DETECTIVE 4 (V.O.)
We have an officer down.	An
officer has been shot.	Request
immediate assistance.

He switches off the light and sits in the dark as the afternoon gathers.

INT. THE DEAD BAR. NIGHT

FITZY, BILLY, and the BOYS are drinking. Dirty, paranoid, guilty, frightened, smoking. DELAHUNT has been shot, is dying, on a dirty couch.

FITZY sits down and looks at Billy.

FITZY
And where the fuck were you?

BILLY
Boss told me to go home.

FITZY
Maybe he did and maybe he didn't.
At any rate you weren't fuckin'

home.

BILLY
I was in a fucking grocery store with no signal. When I got a signal I got the call. What the fuck do you want. Was I there or was I not there? Huh?

FITZY walks away.

DELAHUNT (OS)
Billy.	Billy
(Billy goes over to him)

BILLY
(re: his wounds)

Jesus Christ.
 








 
125.




DELAHUNT
Two days...two days ago the Boss says to me, it's been ten years already, and you've never done me wrong. He asked me, if one of the other guys is a rat, would I take him out. I told him I would but I don't know if I would. Now I know I can't. I've done a lot of bad things but I've never been a murderer.

BILLY realizes that DELAHUNT is dying.

DELAHUNT (CONT'D)
Hey Billy, I don't want no one to
put me in a dumpster. Just don't

put me in a dumpster.

BILLY
When you're dead it makes no

difference where they put you.

BILLY lights him a cigarette.

DELAHUNT
You know what I thought today?

BILLY
What's that?

DELAHUNT
Who didn't show up today is the

rat.

BILLY
Yeah, so?

DELAHUNT
You never been late in your life. And when I called you... I made a mistake. I gave you the wrong address. But you showed up at the right one.

DELAHUNT grips his arm. BILLY is terrified.

DELAHUNT (CONT'D)
Tell me why I didn't say anything.

Tell me why.
 






 
126.

 (2)


He waits for DELAHUNT to continue. But DELAHUNT after an odd smile of complicity, finally dies. BILLY, the only one who knows that DELAHUNT is dead, stares down at him.

FITZY
(drinking)
That cop was tough. We were

excessive with the cop.

BILLY walks past the table.

BILLY
He's dead. I'm going home.

BILLY leaves by the front door.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM. NIGHT

All hands present. Dignam is in a black silent rage.

ELLERBY
Do you know why Queenan went to

that building?

COLIN
No.

DIGNAM
A better question is why your

fuckers were following him.

COLIN
I told Internal Investigations to

follow him.

DIGNAM
Why?

COLIN
That's internal Investigations

business.

DIGNAM grabs COLIN by the neck and runs him into a wall. COLIN gets a palm under Dignam's chin and comes close to breaking his neck. The men at length are separated. COLIN straightens his good clothes.

COLIN (CONT'D)
I have to investigate everybody and anybody. I don't have to justify anything. Nor does anyone have to like it. I now have information...

(MORE)
 


 
127.


COLIN (CONT'D)
from a very good source...that
Queenan may have been killed by his

own undercover.

COLIN is trying this on.

DIGNAM
That's a fucking lie.

COLIN
Captain Queenan and Staff Sergeant Dignam here have information on this undercover, and other informants, in a locked file. I need those files unlocked.

DIGNAM
I don't have the password.	Why
don't you come down to the

garage...

COLIN
That's a lie.

DIGNAM hits COLIN in the face. COLIN goes down hard, into the crook of a file cabinet and the wall. Blood from his mouth.

DIGNAM
No one calls me a liar. Especially when I'm lying.

ELLERBY
Everybody shut up.
(to BROWN)

Work with the tech guys to unlock the files. Dignam. You take a leave of absence.

DIGNAM
Leave of what?

ELLERBY
Queenan's dead. That makes me your boss.

DIGNAM
I'll hand in my papers first.

COLIN
What?
 







 
128.

ELLERBY
Hey, world needs plenty of

bartenders. Two weeks with pay.

DIGNAM
Good.

COLIN
I need those codes.

ELLERBY
No, you want those codes.

EXT. MADOLYN'S OFFICE BUILDING. NIGHT

When she comes out: BILLY is waiting.

BILLY
I tried to call you a few times.

MADOLYN
I know.	(I know.).	I can't...

He leans close to her.	She strokes his head.

MADOLYN (CONT'D)
I can't be a friend to you. I

can't.	I'm sorry.

BILLY
It's okay, okay, I know.

MADOLYN walks away.

INTERCUT COLIN'S OFFICE #2/COSTELLO'S CONDOMINIUM. NIGHT

COLIN needs a shower and is gun-shy as people move past the glass windows. He is still rinsing blood out of his mouth.

COSTELLO is listening to LUCIA di LAMMAMOOR. GWEN sits nearby in attractive lingerie, reading a book.

COSTELLO
Now, when I hear Lucia, I can’t
stop thinking about the cocaine
curtsy you did on that nigger
broad’s face.
(the phone rings. Costello
answers:)
What?
 






 
129.




COLIN
(into phone)

Your shouldn't have killed Queenan.

COSTELLO
One of us was going to have to die. With me it tends to be the other guy.

COLIN
(agitated)

You’re crazy, Frank. You killed the guy who has all the information. And Dignam’s not in the office, he’s gone. He resigned.

COSTELLO
I don’t give a fuck about Dignam.

COLIN
He's fucking gone. They took his
papers in. He's not talking.	I

don't know where he is.

COSTELLO
Don’t get your balls in an uproar, Collie. That Irish piss-ant won’t be a problem. He’s so hot for me, we give him a whiff of my ass, he’ll crawl right in it. Let’s give him a whiff.

COLIN
I will.

COSTELLO
Don’t worry. I’ll take care of it.

COSTELLO turns to the GWEN.

COSTELLO (CONT’D)
Sweetheart, you’re giving me a hard-

on.

He starts to dial the phone.

GWEN
Are you sure it's me or all that talk about whiffin’ and crawlin’ up asses?
 






 
130.

COSTELLO
Hey, watch your fucking mouth.

GWEN
You watch it.

She rises and as she crosses:

GWEN (CONT’D)
Let me straighten you out.

COLIN looks out into the bullpen. People working. On a table he sees PLASTIC BAGS which contains Queenan's bloodstained effects— broken glasses, smashed wristwatch, and CELLPHONE. He glances around, and picks up the CELLPHONE. Blood gets on his fingers. He moves into the office, and seen through the glass, he seizes the phone and with trembling fingers punches up the last incoming number.

INT. BILLY'S MOTHER'S APARTMENT KITCHEN. NIGHT

BILLY is looking at a chipped SANTA MUG from his childhood and is eating something--sheer maintenance, and drinking wine from the bottle. His phone rings. He looks at the ID and is stunned. Queenan's number! He picks up the call but remains silent. The caller is also doing the same.

INT. COLIN'S OFFICE #2. CONTINUOUS

COLIN hears that the other side has hung up the phone. He sees: ELLERBY looking at him through the glass. But Ellerby hasn't seen the phone.

INTERCUT BILLY'S MOTHER'S APARTMENT/COLIN'S OFFICE #2. CONTINUOUS

BILLY is agitated. Exhausted. Frightened. He paces, and looks at the phone. He begins to pack, assembling clothes, money. Finally, like a man committing suicide--it's that intense-- he dials the number. INTERCUT.

COLIN
Yeah.

BILLY
You called this number on a dead

guy's phone.	Who are you?

COLIN
So it is you. Thank God you’re all right. We were very worried.
 





 
131.




BILLY
Who are you?

COLIN
You're talking to Sergeant
Sullivan.	I'm taking over

Queenan’s unit.

BILLY
Let me talk to Dignam to confirm

it.

COLIN
Staff Sgt. Dignam has... taken a leave of absence. He's very upset. We’re all very upset. The best thing would be for your to come in. We need you to come in.

BILLY listens to Colin go on. Then shuts off the phone. His other phone rings.

COLIN dumps out the box of Queenan's belongings. In the diary he sees an entry showing undercover suspects Costello is FBI informant.

BILLY listens to Colin go on. Then shuts off the phone. His other phone rings.

INT. THE CHARLES STREET BRASSERIE. DAY

COSTELLO is sitting with his key guys, including FRENCH and FITZY. A TV station plays above the zinc bar. BILLY is drinking, hitting it heavily.

NEWS ANCHOR
State Police have confirmed that the body of the man found dead in the Fenway marshes yesterday afternoon is that of Timothy Delahunt, an undercover policeman for the City of Boston.. This was the scene today.... If you have

any information about this murder, you are urged to call the Boston Police.

The TV shows DELAHUNT'S BODY being loaded into an ambulance. A crime scene. COSTELLO's eyes have widened slightly. But he is strangely undisturbed.
 






 
132.




FITZY
Fuck.	I can't believe it.

MISTER FRENCH
Don't believe what?

FITZY
I'm embarrassed. How the fuck did they find him so fast? I spent all fuckin' night out there, dragged the poor bastard.... I must have

been there seven hours. In three feet of mud. What the fuck is a marsh? And who walks their dog in a fuckin' marsh? In three feet of water? I don't believe it. I still don't believe he's a fuckin' cop.

COSTELLO
The cops are saying he's a cop so I won't look for the cop.
(to FITZY)

Are you soft? The next time I tell you to dump a body in the marshes, put it in the fuckin' marshes, not where some guy from John Hancock goes every Thursday to get a blowjob!

He makes a move for the door.

COSTELLO (CONT'D)
Proceed.

They get up to leave, following him.

EXT. SOUTHEAST EXPRESSWAY. NIGHT

Two cars carrying Costello and his men are speeding down the highway. Behind them, two SIU CARS are trailing.

INT. COLIN'S OFFICE #2/COSTELLO'S CAR. CONTINUOUS

COLIN closes his door and punches in a number.

IN COSTELLO'S CAR, his cell phone rings.

COSTELLO
Jesus Christ.

He answers it.
 




 
133.




COSTELLO (CONT'D)
What?

COLIN
Don't go. You've got a tail. Two cars. Not very subtle. They won't be subtle from now on. That's what I've been trying to tell you.

COSTELLO
Get rid of them.

COLIN
There's no need to go yourself,

Frank.

COSTELLO
Get rid of the fuckin' tail!

CLOSE on COLIN as what he has to do crystallizes.

COLIN
I will.	All right.

A cold look in his eye, Colin leaves his office and goes down the hall.

IN THE CAR

Costello remarks to French --

COSTELLO
Tails.	Fuckin' rats.	This rat
shit is wearing me thin.

FRENCH
Francis, they're all rats. Women
are rats... cunts...Yeah, we're

becoming a nation of rats.

INT. SURVEILLANCE OFFICE. MOMENTS LATER

BROWN is there. BARRIGAN. ELLERBY. Others.

COLIN
Stop. Stop. Pull these guys off. Tell your team to stop following Costello. We don't need to surveil him.

COLIN stands in the door like a gunfighter. Everyone looks at him.
 



 
134.




ELLERBY
What the fuck are you talking

about?

COLIN
I have it from an undercover:
Costello knows he's being followed.

Let our UC take him in.

ELLERBY
What informant?

COLIN
Queenan's guy. He called me when he found out Queenan was dead. I'm running him.

Everyone is impressed.

ELLERBY
No.	You give him to me.

COLIN
No. But I can give you Costello's

destination.

ELLERBY
You know where he's going?

COLIN
Yes. And what he's about to do. Call off the tail, and get Special Ops. Get them on standby. We meet him where he's going. Suit up. We're gonna take this prick tonight.

BROWN
(to crew on the road)

All units fall back.

Everyone moves at once.

EXT. SOUTHEAST EXPRESSWAY. NIGHT

COSTELLO is checking the rearview mirror. He sees: The TWO SIU CARS exit the highway onto Atlantic Avenue. COSTELLO smiles.

The cars exit the highway. The cars pass through a maze of industrial streets.
 





 
135.



BILLY, riding in the back seat, is trying desperately to see where they are. He sees a STREET SIGN and taps out a text message on his phone.

INT. COMMAND VAN. NIGHT (MOVING)

COLIN, in vest, observed by Brown, reads the message.

COLIN
It's the heavy equipment warehouse Costello owns on Sheffield. He must have a container or a truck in there.
(his big moment of
decision)
Go.

EXT. PARKING GARAGE. NIGHT

It is an unfinished structure, the lower parts used, the upper parts accessible but still under construction. It is built on a pier, the harbor lights beyond it. The COMMAND VAN and POLICE CARS pull up with lights off. A TACTICAL VAN disgorges TACTICAL OFFICERS who spread out through the dark.

INT. COMMAND VAN. CONTINUOUS.

COLIN
(into mic)

There's an exit on the other side. Cover it. We'll take him when he comes out.

COLIN checks the load on his pistol.

INT. AN UPPER FLOOR OF THE PARKING GARAGE. CONTINUOUS

COSTELLO unlocks a CONTAINER with a construction company logo on it, opens the doors, and steps back. BILLY looks into the container. It's cocaine or heroin in kilo bricks. Men stand around with MP5s under their coats.

COSTELLO
Load it.

BILLY, trying to save Costello...

BILLY
How do you know you don't have a

tail?

COSTELLO looks at him.
 





 
136.




COSTELLO
Were you in the fuckin' car?

BILLY
What if they took one off and put

another one on, Frank?

COSTELLO
Load.

The drugs having been loaded fast by the crew, including FNG's, the container is hosed out. BILLY turns from FITZY'S CAR as everyone gets it.

BILLY
Frank told me to check out the

back.	You guys go ahead.

FNG DENNIS
Watch your ass.

Instead of getting into COSTELLO'S CAR on the other side of the container, he steps back into shadows as both cars leave.

INT. COSTELLO'S CAR. NIGHT

FOUR CARS with no headlights bracket the vehicles as soon as they come out of the garage. COSTELLO realizes that something has gone wrong.

COSTELLO
Cocksucker.

LIGHTS come on, and Policemen are everywhere, guns in their hands. COLIN is not visible among them.

POLICE open fire at Costello's car. THE CAR reverses back into the garage. MISTER FRENCH (the driver) is shot in the arm, and the car crashes into a wall. A gunfight opens up.

FNG's exchange fire with brutally efficient tactical cops and are shot down expertly. COSTELLO, limping, gets out of the action, fast. He runs into the parking garage. French drives away (alternately is shot, or commits suicide).

INT. PARKING GARAGE. NIGHT

COSTELLO, shot through the stomach, is moving through the dark. All that's stored in this garage is heavy equipment for the big dig. Plenty of places to hide. We hear gunfire in the distance. COSTELLO hides between two pieces of heavy equipment and dials his telephone. To his surprise the phone rings quite nearby. And keeps ringing.
 



 
137.



COSTELLO moves out into the open, and sees, at a near distance, COLIN, his shadow long on the concrete. He has a gun in his hand. Costello moves out to face him.

COLIN
You’re an FBI informant.

COSTELLO comes out of the shadows.

COSTELLO
Jesus Colin, grow up. Course I'm

talking to the FBI.

COLIN
Do they know who I am?

COSTELLO says nothing for a moment.

COSTELLO
I never gave up anybody who wasn’t goin’ down anyway.

COLIN instantly raises the pistol to shoot him.

COLIN
Did you give me up?

COLIN'S PISTOL wavers.

COSTELLO
Nobody knows nothin’.

COLIN shakes his head and cocks the gun.

COLIN
Frank, Frank, do they know about

me?

COSTELLO
I know you, Colin. You know I’d

never give you up. You’re like...

COLIN
A son...to you? Is that what it is about, all that murderin’ and fuckin’ and no sons? What are you, shooting blanks?

COSTELLO tries to raise his gun which is inside his sleeve. He’s sitting on his coat so that the shot goes off sideways as COLIN shoots him.
 






 
138.

 (2)


COSTELLO topples backward into the bucket of the bucket loader.

ANGLE ON COLIN.

Then from the bucket loader, a post death tremor sets off one last shot from COSTELLO’S gun. Ricochet. COLIN fires into the dead body again and again. He backs away.

COLIN (CONT'D)
I got Costello! I got Costello

here!

INT. POLICE HQ/CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

Colin is debriefed concerning the shooting of Costello.
[Dialog separate document].

INT. BULLPEN AREA. DAY

COLIN enters, tired from a debriefing. Applause from everyone in the office--the full crew. COLIN is embarrassed by the attention. BROWN is leading the whole team to a standing ovation. COLIN looks past the heads of the crowd and sees: Dignam, staring at him evenly.

COLIN
(to crowd)

It's not any reason for, ah...

QUEENAN'S SECRETARY brings him some wine.

COLIN (CONT'D)
Thank you.

QUEENAN'S SECRETARY
No, thank you.

He takes a glass of wine. Then guiltily, almost in tears, he drinks. BROWN jerks a thumb towards Colin's office #2.

BROWN
He's waited a long time for you.
(COLIN looks up and sees
BILLY)
How'd you get him without the

files?

COLIN
Caller ID. On Queenan's phone. You know that guy?
 





 
139.




BROWN
Yeah, we were classmates together.

COLIN
I'm gonna go talk to him.

COLIN goes off.

INT. COLIN'S OFFICE #2. NIGHT

In Colin's office BILLY sits with his ankle on his knee. He looks very tired, dirty. Wearing a VISITOR badge.

COLIN
Good to see you Trooper.

BILLY
Yeah.	"Trooper".

COLIN
Colin Sullivan.	We spoke on the
phone. How long have you been

undercover?

BILLY
Long time.	Long fuckin’ time.

COLIN
I can’t begin to tell you what a
debt we owe you.	I want you to
know I’ll be recommending you for

the Medal of Merit.

BILL
Medal of Merit. Oh, yeah. That’s kinda like a gold star around here, right?

COLIN
It’s the highest honor we got.

BILLY
I just want my identity back.

COLIN
You want to be a cop again?

BILLY
No, being a cop's not an identity.

I want my identity back.

COLIN takes it.
 




 
140.




BILLY (CONT'D)
You’ll have to excuse me. My only contact has been with a police shrink.

COLIN
(throat clicks)
A police shrink.
(instead of asking the
obvious)

Was that... helpful for you?

BILLY
What are you gonna do about the rat in this building?

COLIN
I’m gonna find him.	Don’t you
worry about that.	You got
anything?	Did Frank, ah, say
anything...

BILLY
I'm all done being a cop.	I just
want to get my money and go home.

COLIN
Fair enough.	You’ve given a lot.
I can get you your file.	I just
need your password.

BILLY
The password’s my name, William Costigan, Jr. They gave it to me in case something happened to them and I had to explain myself to someone like you.

He writes it. Colin takes the paper and hides his astonishment.

COLIN
All right, Bill. Just give me a minute. I’m gonna go in the other room. This computer’s gone blooey on me.

Billy nods.	He goes.
 
141.



INT. COMPUTER ROOM. NIGHT

COLIN accesses the personal database, enters the password.
Billy's confidential file opens up. Every fact about the man.
Photos.

INT. COLIN'S OFFICE #2. CONTINUOUS

Billy takes a drink from the bottle COLIN has put on the desk. As he puts the bottle down he sees, sticking out of a box, a BROWN ENVELOPE. On it is written "CITIZENS." BILLY picks up the envelope...and knows everything.

INT. COMPUTER ROOM. CONTINUOUS

COLIN is reviewing it Billy's file. Outside the glass wall we see BILLY, staring at COLIN's back...and then moving on.

INT. COLIN'S OFFICE #2. LATER

COLIN enters, holding a printout of Billy's personnel file. He looks around the empty room. He sees the BROWN ENVELOPE lying on the desk, and understands everything. He sits down at his own computer--which does in fact work, and opens the personnel file.

COLIN clicks DELETE. "Do You Really Want to Delete?" COLIN clicks "Yes" and Billy's picture, file, life, disappear.

EXT. POLICE BUILDING. NIGHT

BILLY exits the police building and moves across the plaza.

INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE MADOLYN'S OFFICE - DAY

BILLY waits outside Madolyn’s office.

MADOLYN, carrying work, breakfast, rounds the corner and sees him standing and waiting for her. She’s a little spooked, opens her mouth to speak...

BILLY
I know. I’m not here to...I’m not here for that. I’ve got something to...to give to you...something I need you to keep. For me.

MADOLYN
What is it?
 







 
142.




BILLY
(stopping her from
speaking)

I need you to be my friend here and not ask any questions. That’s for you to hold.

He gives her a manila envelope.

BILLY (CONT'D)
Only you. Open this if I’m dead or if I call you and tell you to open it. Please do exactly what it says. Exactly what it says, please.

Madolyn is a friend. She’s not going to ask questions. She accepts the envelope.

MADOLYN
All right.

BILLY
I’m sorry to show up here like
this.	There was no one else I
could give it to.	I’m sorry.

There was no one else.

He backs away, and then turns to go.

MADOLYN
I...we...
(he turns)
I’ve, it's, been so confused... I

just want to say...

He turns and looks at her.	She doesn’t speak: can’t.

BILLY
Whatever you have to say, really
think about it, and if you still
want to tell me, tell me in two

weeks, all right?

She moves her head slightly, watches him go.

INT. MADOLYN'S OFFICE. MOMENTS LATER.

MADOLYN sits at her desk, devastated, looking at a fall of light. The envelope lies on her blotter. She sits on ...

then straightens up, takes a marker and writes "COSTIGAN" on the envelope and puts it in her desk drawer.
 



 
143.




We DISSOLVE to a SONOGRAM.

INT. COLIN'S APARTMENT. MORNING

A SONOGRAM picture of a fetus. It looks to him at first like a CCTV picture blown up. COLIN stares as if at something in a horror film.

COLIN
I was dreaming...

MADOLYN
What?

COLIN
I was dreaming I was dead.

MADOLYN
Death is hard.	Life is much
easier.

Referring to the envelope

COLIN
What’s this?

MADOLYN
Open it

He does.

COLIN
Really?

MADOLYN
Yeah.

COLIN
Really?

MADOLYN
Yeah.

COLIN
You’re joking...

MADOLYN
It’s not a joke, it’s a human

being.

Colin belatedly thinks of what a human being might do in these circumstances and kisses her.
 



 
144.




INT COLIN'S APARTMENT - LATER

COLIN is in the shower. MADOLYN moves into the kitchen and puts the kettle on. She checks the mail, lying there on the counter. It's tied with a string. She undoes the string and sorts through the mail. Suddenly, she freezes looking at:

AN OVERSIZED ENVELOPE addressed to COLIN: [COLIN SULLIVAN, 20 Pickering Street, Apt TK, Boston, MA, zip TK], with a return address of Wm. Costigan, 13 Conant St., Boston, etc., etc.]

MADOLYN stares at the envelope, listening to the shower going. Billy has written to her fiance. She starts to put the envelope down, and then realizes...she has to hide it...she has to open it.

Inside the envelope is a jewel case: EXILE ON MAIN STREET. And a note: PLAY ME NOW. MADOLYN puts the CD into the machine. She puts on the headset and listens...and listens.

COLIN comes out of the bathroom, dressed in jeans and t-shirt, barefoot, his hair wet. He looks at Madolyn, realizing that something is wrong.

COLIN
What?

MADOLYN pulls the headphone jack out of the stereo and roughly the following booms out of the speakers. [NOTE: THIS RECORDING WAS DONE IN POST -- I THINK FROM THE PORN THEATRE DIALOGUE.]

COLIN (CONT'D)
Your guys shouldn't have done that.

COSTELLO
One of us was going to have to die.

It tends to be the other guy.

COLIN stares at her and we ought to think murder is a possibility.

COLIN
I'm now in charge of everything here. Including Queenan's informers. Theoretically. I can't unlock the files until after the brass squeezes Dignam. If the brass squeezes Dignam.
 







 
145.

 (2)


COSTELLO
So Dignam's the only one with the

keys to the kingdom.

COLIN
He's fucking resigning. He put his papers in. He's not talking.

COSTELLO
Give me his location. Tonight.

COLIN and MADOLYN stare at each other.

MADOLYN
I thought I was the liar.

COLIN
I can explain.

She goes into the bedroom. COLIN'S PHONE RINGS. He answers it.

EXT. COMMERCIAL BUILDING ROOFTOP. DAY

BILLY is walking, on the phone, happy, and twisting the knife.

BILLY
Costello recorded everything. He put all the tapes in a little box and kept them with his lawyer. That was his insurance. His lawyer came to me. Costello trusted me the most. Imagine that you rat fuck. Sound quality good enough? I was a little worried.

INT. MADOLYN AND COLIN'S APARMENT. CONTINUOUS

COLIN closes a door to speak privately.

COLIN
What do you want?

BILLY
I want my identity, you two-faced

rat prick.

COLIN
Where are you?
 






 
146.




BILLY
Three o'clock. Where Queenan died.

You keep your cell on.

COLIN goes to the bedroom door and tries it. Locked. He knocks. No answer.

COLIN
Did we not talk about this?	This
is my job.

It's over. He starts to punch the door, and then does not.

EXT. COMMERCIAL BUILDING. DAY

COLIN comes along and walks into the lobby. He is not looking for a tail...

EXT. COMMERCIAL BUILDING ROOFTOP. DAY

COLIN looks out through the door, no gun drawn, but very much a cop clearing his corners. He steps out and--BILLY takes him from behind the door, his only blind side, and grabs the back of his collar and crams a pistol into the bottom of his skull.

BILLY
Get your hands up.	Hands.	Hands.

COLIN
Put the fuckin' gun down.

BILLY turns Colin around and puts the pistol to Colin's forehead, hard enough to break the skin. He takes out Colin’s belt gun and puts it in his pocket. (Billy screams "hands!" at Colin every time he makes a move).

COLIN (CONT'D)
I came here to talk some fucking sense to you. You get a hold of yourself and put down the fuckin' firearm and act professional and I can get you your money.

BILLY
(turning him around)

What did you say?

COLIN
I can get you your...
 






 
147.




BILLY cracks him across the jaw with the gun. COLIN goes down. COLIN is drooling blood, his bell rung, one eye open. Billy throws away Colin’s ankle gun.

COLIN (CONT'D)
(spitting teeth)

Fuck, shit...

BILLY
(going for Colin's cuffs)
You didn't come here to talk, you
fuckin' maggot, you came here to

get arrested.

COLIN
Arrested?	Arrested for what.
(as BILLY cuffs him)

So you got tapes of what? Costello was my informant. I was his rat? Fuck you. Prove it. I say he was my informant.

BILLY
Get up and shut your fuckin' mouth.

COLIN
What is this, a citizen's arrest? Blow me, prick. Only one of us is a cop, here, Bill. Nobody knows who you are. Nobody knows who you are.

BILLY
Would you shut the fuck up.

COLIN
I'm a sergeant in the Mass. State
Police.	Who the fuck are you?

Nobody.	I ERASED YOU.

BILLY puts the gun to Colin's head.

BILLY
You erased me?

COLIN
Go ahead. Shoot a cop, Einstein.

See what happens.

BILLY
What would happen is the bullet would go right through your fuckin' head.
 



 
148.

 (2)


COLIN
Watch what happens.

BILLY
What, you think you're gonna get
the parade?	The bagpipes and
bullshit?	Fuck you.
(safeties the gun)

I'm arresting you.

COLIN
That's the stupidest thing you

could do.

BILLY
Shut up, shut up, shut the fuck up.
(hits him)
I don't give a fuck if these
charges don't stick.
(whaling him in the beats)
But I'm still fucking arresting
you.

COLIN is hammered to his knees. Head down, blood in his hair, drooling blood, thinking (impossibly) about his next move. He seems to realize he's fucked.

BILLY (CONT'D)
[You are what you do.]	Get up.
(COLIN doesn't move.)

I said get the fuck up.

BILLY grabs the back of Colin's collar and puts the gun to Colin's head. A crunch of gravel, off. BILLY and COLIN both hear it.

BROWN
Put down the weapon and step away

from Sergeant Sullivan.

BILLY drags COLIN to his feet and using Colin as a shield aims the pistol at: BROWN. Brown is aiming his weapon.

BILLY
I called you.	You specifically.
You know who I am.	I'm not gonna
shoot. I told you to meet me
downstairs.

COLIN
Help me.
 





 
149.

 (3)


Billy realizes he's in a truly shitty situation: appearances are everything.

BROWN
Put the weapon on the deck and step away from Sergeant Sullivan.

COLIN
(a mess, bloody-mouthed)

Shoot the fuckin' prick.

BILLY
(desperqte)

Where's Dignam? I told you to bring Dignam!

COLIN
Shoot the motherfucker!

BROWN
Put the weapon on the ground and

we'll discuss it.

BILLY
He was Costello's rat. I got evidence. Tapes. Other documents.

BROWN
Maybe you do, but right now I need you to drop the weapon.

BILLY
I told you I've got the evidence
cold linking this prick to
Costello...
(BROWN wavers)
You fuckin' know who I am.	I'm
taking him downstairs now.

BROWN, weapon ready, follows into the elevator lobby.

INT. ELEVATOR LOBBY/ELEVATOR. DAY

BILLY moves COLIN into the elevator and as the doors close looks back at BROWN, still in a Mexican stand-off.

COLIN, nose broken, blood masking his face.

COLIN
I can't wait for you to try to
explain this to a Suffolk County

grand jury. This is gonna be fun.
 




 
150.




The indicator ticks. Down, down, down. Colin sobs.

COLIN (CONT'D)
Just fucking kill me.

BILLY
I am killing you.

The doors open and for a frozen moment BILLY, holding the gun on COLIN, stares out of the car. A LOUD BANG. BILLY is shot through the head. BLOOD sprays the walls, and COLIN is hit by flying blood and matter. BILLY falls, crumpled, on his face, half in and half out of the elevator. The doors try to close...open...COLIN, covered with blood, looks up.

BARRIGAN lowers his pistol.

COLIN slumps, covered with blood. BARRIGAN uncuffs him. COLIN feels his wrists. BARRIGAN picks up BILLY'S gun. The other elevator doors open and BROWN emerges. He looks into the bloody elevator and down at the dead man.

BROWN
(holstering his gun)

Shit...

BARRIGAN raises BILLY'S GUN and shoots BROWN in the head.
COLIN stares at him.

BARRIGAN
Did you think you were the only one he had? Costello was going to sell us to the FBI. It's you and me now. We have to take care of each other. You understand?

COLIN
All right. Give me that.

BARRIGAN casually hands COLIN BILLY'S GUN. COLIN presses the gun against BARRIGAN's forehead and fires.

EXT. THE COMMERCIAL BUILDING. DAY

POLICE TAPE, plenty of cars. Three corpses being loaded onto ambulances. COLIN, hands free, is drinking coffee from a paper cup, being checked out by a doctor.

INT. POLICE HQ/CONFERENCE ROOM - NOT MUCH LATER
 







 
151.




COLIN has been cleaned up a little by paramedics. He's maybe had his lip stitched, but he's still wearing his bloody clothes.

COLIN
At that time, Trooper Barrigan, who I now understand to have been Francis Costello's informer in SIU, intercepted us in the lobby and shot Trooper William Costigan once in the head.
(drinks water)
At that time Barrigan retrieved Trooper Costigan's undercover weapon and shot Trooper Brown as he was approaching our location. I attempted to subdue Trooper Barrigan and in the ensuing struggle was struck several times with the Walther pistol. I was able to wrestle the weapon away, at which time Barrigan drew his own weapon and took aim at me. I was able to get off a single shot, striking Barrigan in the head. I then checked for vital signs of Troopers Brown and Costigan and discovered that they had expired.

COLIN looks up, eyes clear, perfectly believable. As we transition to the FUNERAL...bagpipes coming up.

COLIN (CONT'D)
I'd like to go on record that I am recommending Trooper William Costigan for the Medal of Merit.

ON SOUND

BAGPIPES (Something like"Cross of Fire") as we DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. CEMETERY. DAY

BILLY'S GRAVESITE. The same cemetery as his mother is buried in. UNIFORMED POLICEMEN (not only State, but MDC, the way they do it, for "brother officers"), saluting.

MADOLYN is at the gravesite, dry-eyed though in, distinctly apart from COLIN. He looks at her. She looks away from him, apparently forever.
 






 
152.




COLIN squares off: his job in the world is to get ahead. A salute is fired with rifles. But later...

COLIN and MADOLYN are walking through the graves.

COLIN
What about the baby?

She moves away from him without answering. MADOLYN walks out through the cemetery gates. COLIN hesitates.

INT. THE STAIRWAY OF COLIN'S APARTMENT. EVENING

COLIN has a bag of expensive groceries and wine. Living the Beacon Hill dream. He climbs the steps slowly. He nods to a neighbor, an old lady coming down with her dog (who incidentally will never accept him as a neighbor, and COLIN briefly seems aware of this). (Don't be afraid to get a bit French here). He gets to his door, and starts to cry, and nearly crumples. But he gets the door open. He looks up and sees a gun. Behind it, stepping fast out of the shadows, DIGNAM. Avenging a guy he didn't even like, because it's the right thing to do. COLIN looks down and sees that Dignam has plastic hospital boots on his feet.

COLIN
(accepting it, sort of,
but only in a COLIN way)

OK.

DIGNAM fires. Flash groceries fall all over the floor. DIGNAM'S FEET step over COLIN's body, crushing one of a half dozen croissants, and DIGNAM goes down the expensive staircase, leaving the door to the apartment open. The strangest thing happens: a rat emerges and begins to eat the dead man's croissants. The rat hears something and runs so it's not in the shot when it

FREEZES.
