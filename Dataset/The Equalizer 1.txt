AN ALARM CLOCK

Hits 5:30 AM and goes off.


BEDROOM

Grey morning light. Alarm still BUZZING because the room’s empty.

Bed already made. Tight enough to flip a quarter. Room Spartan and immaculate.

Inside the BATHROOM...


A HAND WIPES STEAM OFF A FOGGED BATHROOM MIRROR

Just enough to see the straight razor gliding across the final patch of lather...


INT.	KITCHEN - MORNING

Blender being loaded: Wheat grass, Almond milk, Whey protein, a cup of organic Blueberries.

WRIST WATCH - finger hits the stopwatch button on it...


HANDS DO THE DISHES

Drying the blender and glass. Into a cabinet where there’s only ONE of everything.


ARMS IRON A SHIRT

With the precision of a surgeon. Spray starch, stiff collar and cuffs...


INT.	BEDROOM - MORNING

Shirt’s buttoned.	Leather belt slipped into creased pants.

Tie knotted and tightened exactly.

Stepping in front of a mirror...
 
2.


ROBERT MCCALL

Middle aged, middle class, middle of the road looks. Pleased with his appearance, McCall adds a final touch.

An ORANGE VEST. Finger hits the STOP button on the watch timer...



CUT TO:


A DOZEN ORANGE VESTS

Moving about various aisles inside...


HOME DEPOT - MORNING

Dollies full of Quickset, painting materials and plumbing supplies being wheeled through the aisles by CONTRACTORS AND HANDYMEN.

McCall on a ladder tossing down a box of wall switches to a DAY LABORER.

MCCALL
Didn’t you pick up switches last

week?

LABORER

Owner wants touch dimmers now.

McCall smiles.	Climbs down the ladder.

MCCALL

When they pay...

MCCALL/LABORER

They say.


LOADING DOCK

McCall PUSHES a dolly LOADED WITH PLYWOOD towards a panel VAN. Huffing and puffing past TWO YOUNG DUDES leaning against a fork lift.
 
3.


YOUNG DUDE 1
Should make the old guys take

fitness tests.

YOUNG DUDE 2

Like Firemen.

McCall sweating. Removing his gloves as he walks past the Young Dudes.

YOUNG DUDE 1

Betcha didn’t have to push no dolly in your last job, did ya Pops.

MCCALL
(good natured)

Guilty as charged.

As he walks off...

YOUNG GUY 2
Dudes come in here thinkin’ it’s
all tape measures, paint cans and
“how may I help you”.


INT. HOME DEPOT BREAK ROOM - DAY

McCall on his break. A DOZEN EMPLOYEES scattered around the room on plastic chairs in front of Formica tables.

McCall makes his way to the back table where RALPHIE, a heavyset kid in his 20’s sits alone. Takes a seat.

Ralphie empties the contents of his bag for McCall to see.

McCall looks suspicious.

RALPHIE

It’s Tuna.

MCCALL

What kind of bread?

RALPHIE

Whole grain.	Gluten-free.

MCCALL

Condiments?

RALPHIE

Sprouts.	Avocado.	Veganese Mayo.
 
4.


McCall smiles. Digs into his ground turkey and veggie mix as Ralphie bites into his sandwich...

CRUNCH

Ralphie winces. On McCall’s look Ralphie slides his sandwich across the table. McCall lifts the bread to reveal a layer of potato chips.

RALPHIE (CONT’D)

What?	Potatoes are a vegetable.

Prison yard stare from McCall.

RALPHIE (CONT’D)

I like crunchy things.

MCCALL

Carrots are crunchy. Dried seaweed is crunchy. You like those?

McCall picks off a chip, holds it up.

MCCALL (CONT’D)
Partially hydrogenated vegetable
oil.	Corn syrup.	Those are the
enemy, son.
(beat)
You wanna make Security Guard? You gotta lose weight. Test is coming up in a week. You asked me to help you. But if you’re not going to apply yourself...

Ralphie drops his head in defeat. McCall reaches across the table and lifts Ralphie’s head back up.

MCCALL (CONT’D)

Hey. You can do it. Progress, not perfection.


INT. SUBWAY - NIGHT

Rush hour crowded. McCall stands in the packed car. Just another tired face at the end of a long day...
 
5.


EXT. OCEAN AVENUE, BROOKLYN

Lower middle class neighborhood of aging apartment buildings and bodegas.

Street lamps flicker on as McCall reaches a five story walk up.


BUILDING FOYER

McCall opens the only mailbox with no name on it. Removes a flyer and a credit card offer that go right in the trash.

MCCALL’S KITCHEN

McCall watching the 6:30 news as he washes his dinner dishes... Single dish, fork, knife and glass.

EXT. CONEY ISLAND BOARDWALK - NIGHT

Only half operational. Ferris Wheel moans and creaks under the weight of bundled up PATRONS.

McCall sits on a bench PEOPLE watching. Comfortable. At peace.

PING! The SHOOTING BOOTH catches his attention. Watches a poor IMMIGRANT FATHER plop down dollar after dollar valiantly trying to win a giant Sponge Bob for his kid.

Only to fail every time.

The Father eventually runs out of dollars and walks off with his heartbroken son.


INT. MCCALL’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Clock reads 9:40. McCall in bed. Reading a hardcover of Hemingway’s “Old man and the Sea”.


CLOCK

1:48 AM
 
6.


MCCALL

In the dark.	Wide awake.


INT. A DINER - NIGHT

A punch-drunk, open-all-night dive. A bored COUNTERMAN behind the chipped Formica counter. DOORMAN from down the block reads the next days paper.

A lone GIRL at a table by the window, ear phones in, iPod playing, eyes closed... Cheap cocktail dress, stockings and costume jewelry leave no doubt what she is...

Wall clock says 2:11 AM when McCall walks in with his book.

Shuffles to a seat at his usual table near the back.

Counterman comes over and sets a cup and a small pot of hot water at McCall’s table without asking. McCall uses a napkin to wipe out the cup. Takes a tea bag from his pocket, drops it in the cup and pours the boiling water over it.

Opens his book and reads.

TERI (OS)

He catch the fish yet?

McCall glances up. Teri THE HOOKER pulling her earphones out. Pretty, late 20s. Few tats peeking out from her dress.

MCCALL

Just hooked it.

TERI

About time.

MCCALL

It’s a big fish. Don’t know if he can hang on to it though.

TERI
(playful)

Oh no.

MCCALL

Tooth and nail right now.

TERI

Maybe he’s too old.
 
7.


McCall nods. They’re quiet for a while. Teri takes a bite of her Apple pie.

MCCALL
Thought you were going to stop

eating all that refined sugar.

TERI
(with a mouthful)

I am.

MCCALL

When.

TERI

Any day now.

MCCALL

Bad for the vocal cords.

Teri looks away sheepishly.

MCCALL (CONT’D)

How’s the singing?

She shrugs.

TERI

Got myself a little machine to make demos. We’ll see.

MCCALL

Bet you’re good.

TERI

What makes you think that?

MCCALL

Intuition.

Teri smiles her first real smile. After a beat they descend back into silence.

Teri finishes her pie. Shoulders her tote and starts for the door.

TERI

Lemme know what happens next.
 
8.


INT. HOME DEPOT, ELECTRICAL AISLE - DAY

McCall rolls another Dolly past the Young Dudes slacking off.


INT. HOME DEPOT - HARDWARE AISLE - MORNING

Ralphie stocking packages of extension cords. Looks around to make sure no one is looking...

Pushes aside some boxes and reaches his arm to the back of the shelf. Pulls out...

A bag of sunflower seeds?

MCCALL (OS)

Crunchy.	Just how you like ‘em.

Ralphie looks up to see McCall walk off holding the Snickers Bar he was looking for.


INT. HOME DEPOT - LOADING DOCK

McCall on his break. Popping sunflower seeds and watching the trucks being loaded.

Looks up to see the two Young Dudes standing over him.

YOUNG DUDE 1

We’re bettin’ on what you did ‘fore you got here?

YOUNG DUDE 2

For a living.

YOUNG DUDE 2 (CONT’D)

I bet Insurance.	Claims and shit.

YOUNG DUDE 1

Wall Street.	Stock dude.

McCall pockets his seeds.

MCCALL

I was a Pip.

YOUNG DUDE 1

Pip?	The fuck is a Pip?
 
9.


MCCALL
You know.	Gladys Knight and the
Pips?

McCall gets up. Does a little Pip move. Pulling the whistle on the Midnight Train to Georgia. Young Dudes eyes widening as they slowly get it.

YOUNG DUDE 2

No shit!

MCCALL

One on the right.


INT. HOME DEPOT - DUSK

McCall collects his paycheck from the SUPERVISOR.


EXT. CHECK CASHING PLACE - DUSK

McCall stands in line with OTHER WORKERS.

FACES in line not much different from his. Men not where they expected to be at this stage in life.


INT. MCCALL’S APARTMENT

Dinner dishes already cleaned and put away.

McCall’s at his book case in the back hallway. Watering the few small plants that live on top of it. Shelves lined with book titles that seem eclectic...


MCCALL’S BEDROOM - LATER

Work clothes laid out.	Bed empty.	Clock reads 2:18 AM


INT. DINER - SAME TIME

McCall at his table reading a new book. Tea bag floating in his cup.

Doorman at the counter with the Post as Teri glides in and plops down in her usual spot.
 
10.


Counterman already over with her coffee and donut. Teri takes a quick bite and a sip. Turns to McCall.

TERI

He catch the fish?

MCCALL

He did.

TERI

Happy ending.	Yay.

MCCALL

Not exactly.

McCall closes his book.

MCCALL (CONT’D)
Old Man tied the dead fish to the

boat and had to row back...

Teri’s elbows on the table now.

MCCALL (CONT’D)

On the way in the fish bled out into the water. Blood drew sharks. The old man tried to fight them off...
(beat)

Ate the fish before he could get it home.

TERI

So the whole thing was a waste.

MCCALL
Depends on how you look at it.
(beat)
Old Man spent his life fighting
fish.	Then, when he figured that
part of his life was over, he met
his greatest adversary.
(beat)

It was as if both of them had been waiting for this moment.
(beat)

During the struggle the Old Man sort of formed a bond - a respect - for the fish. A kind of love.
 
11.


TERI

Why didn’t he let it go then?

MCCALL

The Old Man had to be the old man and the Fish had to be the fish. That’s life. You gotta be who you are.

A long pause.	Two people who understand loss.

TERI

Well.	He lost.

MCCALL

Old man went out too far. Farther than he should have.

A long silence. Teri breathes into her cup so the soft steam touches her face. Counterman rhythmically wipes the counter. McCall picks up his new book.

Outside, it begins to rain.


INT. BREAK ROOM - DAY

McCall sitting with Ralphie going over his food plan when
SEVERAL EMPLOYEES singing “Happy Birthday” enter the room.

SUPERVISOR GEORGIE holds a donut sporting a lit candle.

McCall reacts with confusion as Georgie puts the donut in front of him.

Georgie laughs at McCall’s blank look.

GEORGIE

You forget?

McCall realizes it’s for HIS birthday.	Shaking his head...

MCCALL

Talk about a senior moment.


INT. A DINER - NIGHT

Teri at her table. Ear phones in. Lost in some song when a donut is placed in front of her. Looks up to see McCall.
 
12.


MCCALL

Loaded with poison... Just the way you like it.

A beat, she looks up at him.	Ugly bruise on her face.

McCall pretends not to notice.

MCCALL (CONT’D)
Someone’s birthday at work.	Didn’t
want to waste it.

Goes to his table and sits. Counterman brings the pot and cup. McCall takes out his tea bag.

Teri walks over with the donut and sits. Slides a burned CD over to him.

TERI

Let me know if I’m any good.

Catches McCall sneaking a look at her bruise.

TERI (CONT’D)

You should see the other guy. It’s okay... Comes with the job.

Picks up the donut.

TERI (CONT’D)

Whose birthday?

MCCALL

Some guy.

TERI
Happy birthday, some guy.
(a beat)
I’m breaking protocol. Should I go back to my table?

MCCALL

No.	It’s fine.

TERI
I just needed company tonight.
(beat)
Teri.

MCCALL

Bob.
 
13.


Teri studies McCall.

TERI

You don’t look like a Bob. More like a Robert. Robert reads books. Bob watches TV.

McCall smiles.	Picks up the CD.

MCCALL

Teri the singer.

TERI
You and I both know what I really

am.

Takes a bite of the donut.

TERI (CONT’D)
I mean I WANT to be a singer.	I
THINK I can be a singer.	Doesn’t
make me one.

MCCALL
I believe anybody can be who they

want to be.

Teri laughs.

TERI

Maybe where you come from. Not in my world.

MCCALL

Then change your world.

TERI

Not that easy.

Comfortable silence.

TERI (CONT’D)
No ring.
(off McCall’s look)
On your finger. No Mrs. Robert at home?

MCCALL

No.
 
14.


TERI

Ever?

MCCALL

Once.	A ways back.

TERI

Break her heart?

MCCALL
She broke mine.
(beat)
She died.

Teri looks at McCall with a mixture of sadness and curiosity.

TERI

Thought that might be it. I see a lot of widowed guys. It’s the eyes.

MCCALL

The eyes.

TERI
Yeah.	Not sad.	Just... lost.
It’s sweet.

McCall doesn’t blink.	Smart girl.

TERI (CONT’D)

You always read?

MCCALL

No. My wife did. I was away a lot. For work. So she read. Was making her way through the 100 Books everyone should read. Got to 97.

(beat)
Figured it would give us something to talk about someday. Something we could share.

TERI

A hundred books... Holy moly. How many have you read?

MCCALL
 

91.
 
15.


TERI

No shit.	91.	Almost done.

MCCALL

Almost.

Beat.

TERI

Then what?

MCCALL

I don’t know.


EXT. DINER - NIGHT

McCall and Teri walk out together.

TERI

I’m gonna grab a cab.

Both head for the corner...

TERI (CONT’D)

What’s 92 about?

McCall holds up DON QUIXOTE.

MCCALL

Guy who thinks he’s a Knight. Only he lives in a world where knights don’t exist any more.

TERI

Sounds like my world.

Teri steps to the curb to hail a cab. A Few FLY BY. Then a WHITE VAN rolls up.

TALL MAN with LONG HAIR gets out of the passenger side. Bone-colored leather jacket, tanning-bed complexion.

McCall watches Teri stiffen.	The two ARGUE in Russian.

Finally Teri looks back at him.

TERI (CONT’D)
I have to go with them.	It’s okay.
See you... when I see you.
 
16.


Forces a smile and gets in the van. Tall Guy walks over to McCall. Hands him a card.

SLAVI
(Russian accent)
You call number... they send you
another one.	Just as good.	Tell
them Slavi said.

Gets back in the Van and drives off. McCall turns the card over in his hand.

An escort service.


INT. MCCALL’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Bathed in SHADOWS. Everything still. Just the SOUND of Teri’s CD wafting through the rooms.

McCall at the kitchen table with a glass of Grapefruit juice.

Listening.

Rough, edgy, passionate, unpolished.	A diamond in the rough.

McCall’s eyes twinkle just a tad.	Not bad...


INT. HOME DEPOT - DAY

PEARL, 300 pounds of attitude, walking towards the BACK OFFICE. The Two Young Dudes sidle up on either side of her.

YOUNG DUDE 2

Pearly. Which one of us you gonna ask out.

YOUNG DUDE 1

Seen you eyeing us for a week now. But you can only have one of us so... Whose it gonna be?

PEARL

Been eyein’ you two, alright.

Young Dudes primping now.
 
17.


PEARL (CONT’D)
Trying to figure out what either
one of you lazy mutherfuckers do
all day and why I shouldn’t fire

your worthless, bony asses.

Dudes stopping, letting Pearl continue on.

YOUNG DUDE 2

Seems more like your type...

Dude 1 SEES McCall handing a DRIVER a receipt at the LOADING DOCK. Stepping into his path.

YOUNG DUDE 1

Yo.	You weren’t no Pip, Old Man.

Shoves his iPhone under his nose. You Tube Video of Gladys Knight and the Pips. McCall smiles.

MCCALL
Soul Train.	‘82.	That’s me.	On
the end.

YOUNG DUDE 2

Ain’t you.

MCCALL
Few pounds lighter and a lot more
hair.	But damn.	I was good
looking.

McCall perfectly mirrors the dance moves then walks off leaving the Young Dudes staring at the screen.


INT. A DINER - NIGHT

McCall at his table. Tea poured. DON QUIXOTE open in front of him. Keeps glancing at the door.

No Teri tonight.


EXT. HOME DEPOT PARKING LOT - LUNCH BREAK

Several LUNCH TRUCKS parked out front. Orange Vests sprinkled out, eating under trees or on the grass.

Not McCall or Ralphie.
 
18.


They’re at the far edge of the lot, McCall putting Ralphie through an exercise routine. Urging him to do one more pull up, one more push up.

MCCALL
Who’s gonna be the best Security

Guard?

RALPHIE

I am, SIR!


INT. A DINER - NIGHT

McCall walks in. Again, no Teri. The Counterman brings over his cup and pot of hot water. Notices McCall eyeing the door.

COUNTERMAN
She’s up at Kings County.	Heard
someone beat her up pretty bad.


INT. KINGS COUNTY HOSPITAL, IC WARD - NIGHT

McCall is standing on one side of a chicken wire and glass window staring into the Intensive Care room.


INT. ICU

Eight beds.	All filled.	Teri’s in the far corner.
Attached to wires and IV’s.	Face bandaged, neck in a brace.
Almost unrecognizable.

A YOUNG WOMAN dozes in a chair next to the bed.


INT. HOSPITAL CAFETERIA - NIGHT

The same Young Woman pays for a cup of coffee. Takes it to a condiment station and loads it with an ungodly amount of sugar.

MCCALL (OS)

How’s she doing?

Her head snaps.	Finds McCall sitting at a far table.

MCCALL (CONT’D)

Teri.	How’s she doing?
 
19.


The Young Woman eyes McCall, hard as rock. Just another John...

YOUNG WOMAN

Well she’s not good.

The Young Woman reaches for her coffee and tries to bring the cup to her lips. Hands begin shaking and the coffee spills.

McCall steps over and takes the cup from her hands. Sets it down then gets some napkins and sops up the spillage.


THE CAFETERIA - LATER

Under the green glow of Fluorescents, McCall sits at the Young Woman’s table listening.

YOUNG WOMAN

... guy hit her. Some Johns think they can do that.
(beat)

She hit him back and the guy called Slavi...

WHAM!


TERI’S FACE (FLASHBACK)

Hit with a massive fist.	Cheek bone shattering.

YOUNG WOMAN (OS)

He set her straight...


UPSTAIRS OFFICE - WIDER

Teri face up on the carpet. A RING OF MEN standing over her. On the couch THREE OTHER ESCORTS (including the Young Woman) sit silently in horror.

YOUNG WOMAN (OS)
They like making examples of

trouble makers.

Slavi rubs his fist. Offers Teri his hand and gently helps her up.

Teri tries to speak but Slavi flicks open a knife and presses it to her throat.
 
20.


SLAVI
No talking.	Talking is not
problem.	Listening is problem.

Presses harder. Opens a small cut in her throat. Teri GROANS.

Uses the knife to push Teri to her knees in. Other hand unzips his pants and forces himself into her mouth.

Slavi uses the knife to control Teri’s head.
 

Boris moves behind Teri.

enters her from behind.
and Boris rape Teri.
 


Rips her pants open and violently The rest stare glassy-eyed as Slavi

 

HOSPITAL CAFETERIA

The Young Woman stares out into the empty room. Numb to the brutality.

YOUNG WOMAN
Said they’d cut her throat next
time.
(beat)
Said a whore who fucks and can’t
talk is worth twice as much...


INT. SUBWAY - NIGHT

McCall rides home on an almost empty car. Rocks with the rhythm of the train.


EXT. BRIGHTON BEACH CLUB - NIGHT

That White VAN pulls up to the Valet outside an AFTER HOURS CLUB. The Driver, BORIS, steps out and enters a street level door...


MAIN DINING ROOM - AFTER HOURS CLUB

Boris moves through the packed DINING ROOM to a...


BACK STAIRWELL

Where he jogs up to an second floor door.
 
21.


INT. UPSTAIRS OFFICE

THREE prison-hard THUGS sprawled on the couch watching the TV.

Boris waddles in and plops down in front of Slavi who sits behind a large desk. Tosses an envelope onto the desk. Slavi drops the envelope on an antique scale - sees it’s correct - and slides it into the top drawer. Pours a shot for Boris...

When the DOOR OPENS and Robert McCall steps inside...


OFFICE - WIDER

Heads turn. Russians eyeballing up McCall like lions do Antelope.

SLAVI

You lost, dedushka?

McCall hesitates. Makes his way to the desk. Places the card Slavi gave him in front of him.

MCCALL

You gave me this the other night.

SLAVI
I give out lots of cards.	You
want pussy, dedushka?	You still
get it up?

Chuckles from everybody.	McCall waits for it to stop.

MCCALL

I’m here about a certain girl.

Slavi waits.

MCCALL (CONT’D)
Name’s Teri.	She was beat up
pretty bad.

The room gets quiet.

SLAVI

I think you have the wrong address, dedushka.
 
22.


MCCALL

I’m not a cop or anything. I just want to help her.

Slavi studies the man in front of him.

MCCALL (CONT’D)
These girls.	They represent an
investment to you.	I understand
that.

McCall glances around at the other guys.

MCCALL (CONT’D)

I can give you four thousand eight hundred dollars. It’s all I have.

SLAVI
You want to give me four thousand

dollars.	For what?

MCCALL

Her freedom.

Slavi looks at McCall.	Another heartsick John...

SLAVI

This whore.	What’s her name again?

MCCALL

Teri.

SLAVI
(pretending to think)

Doesn’t ring a bell. Whoever she is she must really know how to suck cock.

The muscle LAUGH.

SLAVI (CONT’D)
Believe this guy?	Gonna give me
four thousand for one pussy.	Must
be Ferrari pussy...
(to McCall)
How many fucks you got left, man?
Enough you pay four thousand I
guess.

Slavi turns cancer serious.
 
23.


SLAVI (CONT’D)

The fuck you think you are? Come in here and offer money for my girl. Four thousand. Why not forty thousand? Four hundred thousand? You fucking Americans think you can come into my place of business and buy whatever you want!? You think you set the price? Fucking beautiful Russian girl... You fucking insult me.

All eyes boring in on McCall. An eternity of SILENCE. Then Slavi bursts out laughing.

SLAVI (CONT’D)

Look... he almost wet his pants! I’m fucking with you, man. You got big balls coming here. I like that. Okay. Be Mr. White Knight. The fuck do I care.

Slavi holds out his hand...

SLAVI (CONT’D)

Four thousand eight hundred for the pussy....

McCall takes it.

SLAVI (CONT’D)

A month.

McCall goes to pull away but Slavi tightens his grip.

SLAVI (CONT’D)
You think one-time payment?	For
pussy like that?

Lets go of McCall’s hand.

SLAVI (CONT’D)

Go home and jerk off four thousand eight hundred times. Then come back. She be used up then and I sell her to you.

McCall realizes that’s it.	Turns towards the door.
 
24.


Slavi nods to one of the Muscle who grabs a six-inch blade from a table and shoves it up his sleeve. Moves behind McCall as McCall reaches for the door knob.

Only McCall does something unexpected...

HE LOCKS IT.


MCCALL’S EYE

Turns. Half-lidded. Dull. Like a alligator. WE PUSH INTO THE PUPIL AS IT DILATES. In it WE SEE...


THE ROOM

As McCall sees it. With the detachment of a predatory animal...

A series of frozen pictures flashing through McCall’s head - mind calculating and evaluating a thousand details in a millisecond ...

PARTS OF THE ROOM FADE AWAY. THE UNIMPORTANT PARTS TO MCCALL. Walls, doors, furniture, faces...

Leaving only what’s necessary to him: The glass edge of a shelf. The DRAGON TATTOO covering the CAROTID on the man’s neck, the handle of a KNIFE in the man’s waistband... the throbbing heartbeat in the center of the second MAN’S CHEST... The SHOT GLASS on the edge of a table... The third man’s eye and the outline of a gun under his coat...

And the fork.

Weapons and targets disconnected from any sense of humanity.

The eye measuring the distance between the objects and the time it will take him to kill everyone in the room.

This has all happened...


IN THE BLINK OF...

McCall’s eye.

MOUTH mumbling - almost inaudibly...
 
25.


MCCALL

Forty-five seconds...


MCCALL’S HAND

Moves to his watch...	PUSHES a button...

CLICK...


WHAT HAPPENS NEXT

Defies explanation. There is no form or elegance to it. It’s not graceful or flashy. Just brutal and beautiful at the same time.

McCall snapping the glass shelf in two... the jagged edge hisses through the first man’s neck - slaying the dragon - an opera of blood enters the air...

McCall already across the room. Planting the fork deep into the heart of the second man...

The OTHERS halfway to their feet when McCall scoops the Gold shot glass from the table, ramming it into the eye socket of the third man, driving it deep enough to enter the man’s brain... Man quivering like a frog in a science experiment...

Slavi’s hand coming out of the desk drawer with a .45...

McCall already pulling the trigger of the gun inside eye-socket’s pocket...

Blowing Slavi’s hand off at the wrist... hand and gun twisting into the air like a dead bird...

McCall catching the head of the fourth man. Using his weight and leverage to snap the neck with a nauseating crunching sound...

McCall steps back...

As THE MEN fall around him.

Heartbeats, the rush of blood, the sigh of breath... all cease.

The room now ungodly quiet.
 
26.


McCall back to earth as gently as an autumn leaf...

CLICK

Hits the button on his watch.	49 seconds.

McCall looks disappointed...


SLAVI

Gasping for breath. Hyperventilating. Handless arm aspirating blood into the carpet. Good hand fumbling with his Cell Phone...

McCall crouches beside him. Takes Slavi’s Cell from his hand. Voice quiet and devoid of smugness.

MCCALL

Your heart’s beating three times its normal rate, trying to keep your blood pressure up. That’s why you’re having trouble breathing. But you’re losing too much blood. In 30 seconds your heart will give up and go into cardiac arrest. Your body’ll shut down and you’ll slowly suffocate. It’s going to suck to be you.
(beat)
So I need you to concentrate and
listen to me...

Slavi’s eyes find McCall.

MCCALL (CONT’D)

I want you to think about the girl. The one you beat and raped. I want you to know her life is going to go on while yours is going to end on this filthy carpet with no one giving a shit. I also want you to understand that you died over forty-eight hundred dollars. If you had taken it everything would have been different. I gave you an out but you didn’t take it. Guys like you never do.

Slavi’s eyes register the last words before they go blank.
 
27.


MCCALL’S HANDS

Under a running faucet. Trickles of blood mixing with the water...


MCCALL’S KITCHEN - LATER

Dark. Silent. McCall at the sink. Cleaning his hands. Looking up at his reflection in the window. Studies it like it was some other person.


ALARM CLOCK

Hitting 5:30 AM.


BATHROOM

Empty.	Mirror still steamed.


KITCHEN - MORNING

Blender drying in the sink...


INT. HOME DEPOT, BREAK ROOM - DAY

McCall staring at them.

MCCALL
Test is tomorrow.	You don’t want
to be eating that salty sh---

RALPHIE
They’re for you.
(off McCall’s look)
Open it.

McCall does. Nothing inside except a piece of paper with the number “210” written on it. McCall looks up.

RALPHIE (CONT’D)

What I weighed this morning. Down 9 pounds. I made the weight.
 
28.


McCall grins.

RALPHIE (CONT’D)
Gonna ace that test tomorrow, Mr.

McCall.	Thanks to you.

They knock knuckles. Ralphie notices the broken skin on McCall’s knuckles.

RALPHIE (CONT’D)

What happened?

MCCALL

I hit it on something stupid.


INT. SUBWAY - NIGHT

McCall with the other commuters at the end of another long day.


INT. MCCALL’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

McCall eating at the kitchen table. Watching the NEWS on his small TV.

On Screen: A REPORTER outside the After Hours Club, crime scene tape strung across the sidewalk behind her.

REPORTER

... in what Police are calling the beginning of a mob war between rival Russian factions.


MCCALL’S ALARMCLOCK

Reads 2:29 AM.	CAMERA PULLS BACK to REVEAL...

McCall SOUND ASLEEP.


INT. AFTER HOURS CLUB, UPSTAIRS OFFICE - SAME TIME

The scene of McCall’s decimation now empty and dark. Bodies gone but walls and floor like a Pollack canvass.

THREE SHADOWY MEN IN SUITS stand center room. No one saying anything for the longest time. Can’t see their faces.
 
29.


But their movements are those of men of power. Not used to not knowing...

VOICE 1

No forced entry. No defensive wounds. Not one of them got their pieces out.

Another long silence.	A FOURTH MAN walks in.

FOURTH MAN’S VOICE Security cameras in the restaurant worked fine. Till 8:02. Then they mysteriously go down for 8 minutes. 8:10 they’re back on and these guys are dead.

ALL are silent.	All eyes go to one man in particular.

VOICE 1

What do you want to do?


HOME DEPOT - MCCALL

Rolling a dolly of FIXTURES out to a Contractor’s Truck.

Just another orange vest...


BREAK ROOM

McCall sitting at his table. Meal finished. No Ralphie. Looks up at the clock as one of the Fork Lift Driver’s walks past...

MCCALL
Gordy.	You see Ralphie?	He’s
taking that Security Guard test

after work.

GORDY
Supervisor said he called in and

quit.

MCCALL

Quit?

GORDY
Quit.	No notice.
(starts off)

(MORE)
 
30.

GORDY (CONT'D)
Kids don’t know shit about

responsibility.


EXT. FLATBUSH AVENUE - DUSK

A block of small family-owned places. Bodegas and restaurants manned by people who came here to get their piece of the dream.

McCall coming down the block checking addresses. Stops across from...


EXT. EL TAPITO MEXICAN RESTAURANT - DUSK

Small place rammed mid-block. Door’s open, but the SIGN LIGHTS are off.


INT. EL TAPITO RESTAURANT

A few mismatched tables and a take-out counter.

A wall in the dining area is blackened and charred from fire. A couple booths ruined by water damage. Two YOUNG MEN and AN OLDER WOMAN are working to clean up the mess.

Ralphie walks out of the back room and sees McCall standing in the doorway. Face lighting up.

RALPHIE

Mr. McCall!

MCCALL
Ralphie.	Heard you quit.	I was
worried.

RALPHIE
My mom had a little accident here.

Gonna have to help around here now.

Turns to the older woman and tenderly motions her over.

RALPHIE (CONT’D)
Mama...esto es mi amigo, del
trabajo, el Sr. McCall.	El que me
ha estado ayudando.
(beat)
This is my mother Marta. Those are my brothers Rico and Manny.
 
31.


McCall looks around. SEES the love and hard work put into the place. Notices holes punched in the ceiling.

MCCALL

No one was hurt I hope.

RALPHIE

No.	Happened after hours.


EXT.	BACK ALLEY

McCall walks with Ralphie to the dumpster where he tosses some ruined floorboards.

RALPHIE
Probably a faulty wire or

something.

MCCALL

Wasn’t any wire.

Ralphie turns.

MCCALL (CONT’D)
Point of origin was middle of the
room.	Aren’t any outlets there.
Vent holes were punched in the
ceiling.
(beat)

What happened, Ralphie?

Ralphie gives McCall a look that could break your heart.

Empties the can then turns to McCall.

RALPHIE

Lot of the people in this neighborhood are new to this country. They don’t have much except their businesses. We’re easy targets. So men come in and say, for so much money every month, they’ll look out for us. Make sure nothing happens. So you pay. When business gets better, it goes up. When business is slow you still pay. You don’t...

Ralphie is quiet a moment, the vestiges of defeat, loss and resignation passing over this gentle man’s face.
 
32.


RALPHIE (CONT’D)

They gave my Mama a week to make it up. We’re gonna open for breakfast. See if we can make enough extra. Me and my brothers are gonna do the morning shift so my mother can rest.

An odd mixture of compassion and steeliness on McCall’s face. Nods his understanding that life sometimes sucks. Ralphie starts back inside.

MCCALL

Why don’t you call the police?

Ralphie turns back.	Looks at McCall with confusion.

RALPHIE

They are the police.


EXT. MCCALL’S APARTMENT BUILDING - AFTERNOON

A bright and peaceful Sunday. McCall approaching his Building with grocery bags in both hands. Puts them down to get his keys out...

VOICE (OS)

Hey!

McCall turns to SEE...


TERI

Fresh-faced, no make-up. Walking up healed and hopeful despite the faint bruises and bandage that circles her neck.

McCall looks at her with surprise. Teri breaks into a smile brighter than the sun.

TERI

Remembered you lived on this block. Been swinging by the last few days hoping to catch you.

McCall drinks in the change.

TERI (CONT’D)

Pretty different, huh.
 
33.


MCCALL

Night and day.

TERI

Mandy told me you came to the hospital. That was nice. Not many people cared.

McCall simply nods.

MCCALL

Well you look great.

TERI

I’m pretty much all better. Last stitches come out next week. Other than that...

Teri remembers something. Reaches in her purse and pulls out a battered copy of “The Razor’s Edge.”

TERI (CONT’D)

Ever read it?

MCCALL

No.

TERI

Got it at a used book store. Guy there recommended it. I’m reading now. You believe that?
(beat)
Got a real job with real people hours. Going to open Mic Nights at a few clubs. So I won’t be coming back to the diner.
(beat)

A new start I guess.

MCCALL

It suits you.

Pause.

TERI
Someone once told me you can be

whoever you wanted to be.

MCCALL

Life will surprise you sometimes.
 
34.


Teri smiles.	Holds out her hand.

TERI

I’ll miss the stories.

MCCALL

You have your own now.

McCall reaches out and the two shake. Only Teri doesn’t let go. Childlike eyes watering a bit.

TERI

Thank you.

MCCALL

For?

And there’s a moment where we understand - she knows. Not because of any proof or certainty. She just knows... Raises onto her toes, gives McCall a peck on the cheek.

TERI

For everything.

Then she’s off.


MCCALL

Motionless.	Watching her cross the street bright as a comet.

Whole life ahead of her.

When she disappears only then does McCall move.

Face reflecting a strange sense of peace. Eyes understanding one less person in the world is hurting.

THAT HE DID THAT.

Picks up his bags and heads into his building. Finally getting it. Finally understanding who he is...

INT. EL TAPITO MEXICAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Plastic bags cover the holes in the ceiling. A thin coat of paint barely masks the burnt wall. SEVERAL FAMILIES dining.

But the room is subdued.
 
35.


Then we see why: NYPD DETECTIVES, HARRIS and GILLY occupy the only booth. Large, red-faced men with predatory intent. Meals finished they slide out of the booth and stroll to the register where Ralphie’s mother waits.

Gilly takes a tooth pick. Ralphie’s dispirited mother removes an envelope from her apron and slides it across he counter. Harris takes it.

HARRIS

Beans were a little watery.


EXT. EL TAPITO MEXICAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT

The street is empty, traffic light this time of night.

Harris and Gilly walk to their car.	About to get in when...

VOICE (OS)

Officers...

Both men look up. McCall stands against an iron gated storefront.

MCCALL

I’d like to report a crime.

The Cops in no mood...

GILLY

Call 9-1-1 pal.


INT. IMPALA

Harris behind the wheel. Flips the visor up and cranks the engine. Gilly’s CELL PHONE RINGS. Flips it open.

MCCALL (OS)
Why call 911 and unduly tax city
services when I have two corrupt
cops right in front of me?

Harris looks out the window. SEES McCall talking to him from HIS cell.


EXT. STREET

Cops exit the vehicle and approach McCall.
 
36.


GILLY

Where’d you get that number.

MCCALL
Wasn’t hard.
(beat)
Neither was getting this.

Holds up the CELL PHONE so they can see the screen. A VIDEO PLAYS. From a hidden angle. Gilly and Harris in some BODEGA...

HARRIS (OS)
(on screen)

Don’t fuck with us. Ask the lady down the street. One that had the fire last week. Could happen to you. With your whole fucking family in it. You pay like everybody else.

The last IMAGE is Harris taking cash from the Proprietor.

McCall closes the phone.

MCCALL

When a person obtains money, property or services from a person, entity, or institution through coercion it becomes a criminal off-

Harris’ nickle-plated .38 is against McCall’s temple before McCall can finish. Gilly grabs the Phone from McCall. Pats him down.

Gilly shoves McCall against the gate.

GILLY

Copies?

MCCALL

That’s the only one.

Harris and Gilly exchange looks. What kind of a fucking psycho is this?

HARRIS

You must have a death wish then.

Gilly spins McCall around, pressing his face against the wall.
