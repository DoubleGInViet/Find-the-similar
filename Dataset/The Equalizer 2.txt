HARRIS (CONT’D)

What the fuck you want? Other than to be a corpse.

MCCALL

I’d like you to return the money you took from those people. All of it. To everyone.

HARRIS

Why would we do that?

McCall looks tired. The weariness of seeing too much of this shit.

MCCALL
Two reasons.	Because I’m asking
nicely.	And it would be in the
best interests of everyone

involved.

HARRIS

Maybe our best interests are to tie a cinder block around your waist and throw you into the east River.

Gilly takes out his handcuffs. Gets one around McCall’s wrist...

And suddenly...

He’s not there.

Somehow now behind Gilly. Ramming his face into the brick wall. Nose hitting first. SOUND of shattering cartilage nauseating.

Harris spins and pulls the trigger. Only to realize McCall’s thumb is already between the hammer and chamber.

McCall slamming Harris hard enough with his own .38 that knocks him to his knees. Delivers several compact blows to Harris and rips the gun out of Harris’ hand. Uses it to whack Gilly across the head. Gilly tumbling like a sack of cement.

Both cops down in heaps. Bleeding and dazed. McCall crouches down on their level. Adds Gilly’s revolver to his collection.
 
38.


The next words come from deep inside McCall.

MCCALL

You’re supposed to stand for something. Uphold the law. Serve and protect. Justice for all. Somewhere those words lost meaning and you became everything, you used to detest.

McCall rises. Like a machine ejects the clips from both guns. Empties the chambers, pockets the clips and tosses the guns into the cops’ laps.

Battered faces look up at him.

HARRIS

Who the fuck are you?

MCCALL

The guy you didn’t count on.


INT. TAXI - MOVING

McCall staring out the window as the STREETS and the LIFE in them whiz by...

MCCALL (OS)
By noon tomorrow you’ll have
returned the money you've taken.
You’ll tell those people it will
never happen again.	Do that and
this video will never be seen.


INT. MCCALL’S BATHROOM

McCall, ghost-like through the STEAM in the SHOWER. All sorts of feelings pulsating through him...

MCCALL (OS)

Don't and an hour later you’ll watch the uncut version of yourselves on every news outlet in the Tri-State area.
 
39.


EXT. STREET - HARRIS AND GILLY

Pulling their bruised bodies out of their Impala. Walking towards EL TAPITO...

MCCALL (0S)
There’s nothing you can do to
prevent any of this.	So don’t
waste your time...
(beat)
I’m not like anyone you’ve dealt

with.


INT. EL TAPITO

Ralphie’s mother taking the brown paper bag and looking into it.

MCCALL (OS)
I’m offering you a second chance.

You should take it.

Shock, disbelief and joy roll across her face as she sees the money and listens as Gilly explains their change of heart.

INT. HOME DEPOT - DAY

McCall stocking a pallet of Garden Hoses. Looks up as Ralphie walks by, Orange Vest and work gloves on, huge smile on his face...


EXT. SOFTBALL FIELD - SUNDAY AFTERNOON

Dirt diamond at one end of a LARGE PARK.

Softball game between Home Depot and IKEA. Out-of-shape CLERKS sporting two-toned T-shirts.

McCall out in left field.

WHACK! The ball is smoked to left. Sailing over McCall’s head who turns and takes off after it... Three steps in he pulls up, grabbing his hamstring. Watches the ball fall...

Into the glove of Young Dude 1 who comes out of nowhere like a blur.
 
40.


YOUNG DUDE 1
Hope you’re eligible for Medicaid,

Mr. Pip.

McCall smiles.	Starts in...	Then stops.


RALPHIE

Standing near the Home Depot bench. Resplendent in his blue SECURITY GUARD UNIFORM...


INT. MCCALL'S APARTMENT- NIGHT

McCall exits the bedroom. Stops at the bookcase and slides book number 93 off the shelf. "A Bend in the River" by V. S. Naipaul.

Grabs his keys from the Foyer table and opens the front door...


THE LARGE MAN FILLS THE DOOR FRAME

Grey suit, shirt and tie.	Frozen in mid-knock.

TEDDY

Mr. McCall.

Voice soft and face with a charming, almost ever-constant smile.

This is TEDDY COLEMAN. Forties, with ceramic black eyes. Body language like a walking credential. His whole being vibrates... wrong.

TEDDY (CONT’D)
Sorry to bother you.	I’m
investigating a homicide that
occurred in Brighton Beach ‘bout 10
days ago.

McCall’s face gives nothing away.

TEDDY (CONT’D)

Five guys dead.	Russian joint.

MCCALL
Saw it on the news.	I was there
that night.
 
41.


TEDDY

You were?

McCall smiles.

MCCALL

You wouldn’t be here if I weren’t.

Teddy laughs.

TEDDY
Got me there.
(beat)
Just checking to see if any of the patrons remembered anything suspicious.

MCCALL

Actually I did.

TEDDY

You did?

MCCALL

My waiter.

TEDDY

Your waiter?

MCCALL

Would disappear for long stretches at a time.

Teddy laughs.

TEDDY
That accounts for the poor Zagat
rating.
(beat)

So nothing unusual.

MCCALL

None that I recall.

TEDDY

Okay then.

About to go.	Stops...
 
42.


TEDDY (CONT’D)
Can I ask why you dined at that

particular restaurant?

MCCALL

Felt like some Pirozhki.

TEDDY
Pirozhki.	That’s the little pie
with the onions, meat stuffed
inside.	Sounds good right about
now.	Haven’t had dinner yet.
(good natured smile.
Then...)
I ask because there’s 7 authentic Russian restaurants within walking distance of your apartment. I assume they all serve Pirozhkis?

A jolt of electricity hits the air. You couldn’t tell it by McCall’s face. Remains neutral.

MCCALL

I was meeting a friend. She picked it.

TEDDY

Guess I should talk to...

MCCALL

Shelly. But she won’t be any help. She never made it. Her daughter had a fever.

Teddy studying the average looking McCall. Pieces not making sense.

TEDDY
Well.	Thank you for your time
then.

MCCALL

Don’t you want to give me your card? In case I remember anything later?

Teddy pats his pockets.

TEDDY

Must’ve given them all out.
 
43.


Teddy starts for the stairs...

MCCALL

How did you find me?

Teddy stops.

TEDDY

Excuse me?

MCCALL

Paid cash for my meal. Didn’t have a reservation. Wondered how you found me.

Teddy’s eyes suddenly laser sharp.

TEDDY
That’s what we do, Mr. McCall.

Find people we need to find.

McCall smiles.

MCCALL
Hope you get who you’re looking

for.

Teddy disappearing down the stairs...

TEDDY

I always do.


INT. SUBURBAN

Idling curb side. Exhaust swirling into the air obliterating outside commotion.

Teddy slides into the back seat. MASTERS turns. Teddy Jr. with matching haircut and morals but none of Teddy’s street smarts.

MASTERS

Anything?

Waits as Teddy replays the strange conversation in his head. Realizes he’s not going to answer. Throws the vehicle into drive.
 
44.


MCCALL - FROM HIS WINDOW

Watches the Suburban slip into traffic...


EXT. HOME DEPOT - MORNING

DAY LABORERS mill by the entrance to the PARKING LOT. Young Dudes wheeling out LAWN FURNITURE and GAS GRILLS as the store opens its doors...


INT. HOME DEPOT - HR OFFICE - DAY

LINDA PALISKI, the pleasant and mildly plump HUMAN RESOURCES GIRL at her desk. Looks up to SEE McCall in her doorway eating a Bagel.

MCCALL

You get a Bagel?

LINDA

Bagel?

MCCALL
Hit the lotto last night.	36
dollars.	Couldn’t retire on that
so figured I’d treat everyone to

Montague Street Bagels.

LINDA

Blueberry?

MCCALL

Better hurry.

McCall watches her go. Slips inside. Drops behind her desk computer...


ANOTHER COMPUTER - SOMEPLACE ELSE

ROBERT MCCALL being typed into the search box...

Teddy waits a second for the results. The LARGE ROOM he’s in suggests HIGH TECH EQUIPMENT of an enormous capacity...
 
45.


MCCALL

Small room and tiny computer. EMPLOYEE FILE on screen. HIGHLIGHTS his SOCIAL and changes it. Moves to his BIRTH DATE...


TEDDY

Downloads McCall’s HOME DEPOT FILE and hits PRINT. Paper spitting into the tray...


EXT. HOME DEPOT - DUSK

EMPLOYEES leaving for the night.	McCall one of them.

Bumping knuckles with Ralphie in his powder blue uniform...

We’re WATCHING THIS FROM...


INSIDE A SUBURBAN

Masters, Teddy’s main guy watches McCall disappear down into the Subway. Engine running, Bluetooth connected...

MASTERS

He’s what the file says. Home Depot employee. Keeps to himself, no connections to anything we’re looking for.

Frustrated silence.

TEDDY (OS)

Bring it in.


INT. DUANE REED - NIGHT

McCall loads his basket with TRAVEL SIZE mouthwash, toothpaste, shampoo, etc.


INT. KINKO’S - NIGHT

McCall in the PC Section. Cutting, pasting then typing something on the Computer screen.
 
46.


EXT. JFK INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY

A PRIVATE 747 sits wheels down and motionless at the end of Runway 13L. Far from the terminal buildings.

TSA VEHICLE crossing the TARMAC and pulling up next to the jumbo jet.

Teddy Coleman is let out.	Climbs the steps to the plane.


INT. 747 - DAY

Stripped of everything. ALL overhead bins and seats have been removed.

Just a painted, thickly carpeted cavernous shell contains nothing but four ZERO GRAVITY CHAIRS where business class would be, an aft SLEEPING SUITE and TWO COUCHES on either side of a CONFERENCE TABLE.

Just outside the COCKPIT a handsome teak dining table. At which sits...

VLADIMIR PUSHKIN

Small elegant man of 33.	Quietly eating dinner.

Teddy gets halfway to him when A LARGE SECURITY TYPE steps in his way. Directs him to the conference table.

IVANN GULYAYEVA motions Teddy to sit opposite him. Pushkin’s “Advisor” clears the paper work in front of him.

Looks at Teddy for several seconds. For the first time Teddy appears unnerved.

IVANN
Slavi Sokolov was a very valuable
part of our east coast, USA
enterprise.	Mr. Pushkin is
extremely upset at his demise.

Teddy’s eyes move over Ivann’s shoulder onto Pushkin. The man eats. Never looking up.

IVANN (CONT’D)

Eleven months ago you convinced Mr. Pushkin you and your team could offer unparalleled security and um...

(MORE)
 
47.

IVANN (CONT’D)
problem solving for our operation
here.
(beat)
We’ve paid you a lot of money to
shield our interests.
(beat)
But this happens.	And now Mr.
Pushkin doesn’t know what to think.

Teddy looks back to Ivann. Ivann lets the words hang there. If waiting were a martial art this guy would be a grand master.

Finally...

IVANN (CONT’D)

A man of your stature and means has neither identified or apprehended the people responsible. It sets a bad precedent.

Pushkin still hasn’t looked up from his meal. As if Teddy wasn’t there.

IVANN (CONT’D)

Mr. Pushkin wants the perpetrators punished. With extreme prejudice. A clear message sent.
(beat)

Otherwise...

Teddy feels a chill run down his spine. Looks over and SEES Pushkin staring at him. Eyes milky white and dead.

Pushkin may be blind but his eyes speak with impossible clarity...

Fix this or I’m looking at a dead man...


INT. TACTICAL ROOM - LATER

Teddy and his THREE GUYS sitting in the glow of a DOZEN plasma screens. Frustrated looks all around.

TEDDY

Three, four guys walk into a room, I don’t care you know ‘em or not, you prepare. These were hard core killers.

(MORE)
 
48.

TEDDY (CONT'D)
Not one of them gets their pieces

out.	No defensive wounds either.

Teddy reads over the Police Report for the umpteenth time.

MASTERS

Go back.	What’s the motive here.

PEDERSON

Payback for the Vlastok hit...

Teddy doesn’t look up.

TEDDY

Bunch of clowns. Company Intel had that group back in Moscow before her body hit the incinerator.

Guy with the Buddy Holly glasses swivels his chair around.

BUDDY

Slavi handled Pushkin’s east coast trade.

MASTERS

Except no one would so much as sneeze in Slavi’s direction because of our... involvement.

Teddy drops the report.

TEDDY

We’re looking at this wrong. We keep figuring a group. Looking at the patrons downstairs as some sort of look-out for the killing team.
(beat)
What if one of them WAS the killer.

All eyes move to Teddy.

TEDDY (CONT’D)

What if it was one guy.


MCCALL

In his KITCHEN pasting the newly printed Prescription labels on the Duane Reed bottles...
 
49.


MCCALL’S LAPTOP

Open on a TRAVEL SITE. McCall punches in his Pre-Paid Visa card number and hits PURCHASE. Confirmation for his business-class plane ticket to Cartagena, Columbia appears...


INT. HOME DEPOT - DAY

McCall in the hardware aisle with a frustrated HOMEOWNER. Guy has a Home Depot bag open and is holding a Kwikset DOOR KNOB and DEAD BOLT package.

HOMEOWNER

... I mean, what does it say right there?

MCCALL

Universal.

HOMEOWNER
Meaning it’ll fit any existing

door...

MCCALL

In the Universe.

HOMEOWNER

Only it didn’t fit in my door.

MCCALL
You sure your door is from this

Galaxy?

The guy looks at McCall.	McCall smiles.	Both LAUGH.

MCCALL (CONT’D)

Lets get you your money back.


HOME DEPOT, FRONT OF STORE - DAY

McCall walks up front to the REGISTER AREA. Sees the LINES are not moving.

MCCALL

C’mon.	I’ll get you out of here.

McCall walks him over to JENNY. Older and heavy set, checking out a customer on Aisle 1.
 
50.


MCCALL (CONT’D)
Jenny?	Can you do a quick card
refund for this gentleman?	He’s in
a hurry.

Jenny doesn’t move.	Head and eyes down...

McCall looks to the customer and SEES he’s WEARING A TRANSLUCENT PLASTIC MASK giving his face doll-like features.

Hand in the pocket of his Hoodie griping the butt of a Raven .25

MASKED THIEF

Tell the bitch to move it, old man.


MCCALL

Lowers his eyes and speaks quietly.

MCCALL
She’s scared.	I’ll get it.
(beat)

Excuse me, Jenny.

Gently steps in front of her. Opens the cash register, hands the cash to Masked Thief. Thief about to leave when he eyes the RING on Jenny’s hand.

MASKED THIEF

The ring.

Jenny puts her hand over the SMALL DIAMOND RING on her right ring finger.

JENNY

No.	Please.	It was my mother’s...

Masked Thief pulls his weapon and cocks the hammer. Jenny bursting into quiet tears.

Frantically tugging at the ring.	It’s on too tight.

McCall calmly takes her hand. Holds it to her cheek. Tears pool around the ring and with one twist McCall slips it off her hand. Hands it to Masked Thief.
 
51.


MCCALL LOOKING AT HIM

Like he did the Russians:	The series of snapshots flashing

through in head: Gun - make and model. Mask - Price sticker with store name. Tat - peeking out of the kid’s sleeve. Car Key - hanging from his belt.


BACK TO REAL TIME

McCall hasn’t moved. Stark still as the Thief backs out of the store. McCall’s eyes saying what his mouth doesn’t...

Shouldn’t have done that...


INT. HOME DEPOT - CAFETERIA - LATER

POLICE finishing up. McCall signs his statement. Gives Jenny a pat and walks over to a despondent Ralphie.

MCCALL

Hey. Nothing you could do. Police just said the guy’s done four like this. Shot a Security Guard over in Bensonhurst a month ago. It’s just money...


HARDWARE AISLE

McCall passes the TOOL SECTION and a rack of sledgehammers.


INT. HOME DEPOT - LOADING DOCK - NEXT MORNING

Jenny punching in. Hand shaking. Bandage on her face. McCall punches in behind her.

MCCALL

Feeling okay?

JENNY

Still a little freaked out.

MCCALL

Need anything, I got your back.

McCall walks off and WE STAY WITH Jenny.
 
52.


Through the store with her cash drawer. To her register. Keys it open. About to slip her drawer in when she looks down in astonishment.

Her mother’s diamond ring laying in the tray.


IN ANOTHER AISLE

McCall walking through the TOOL SECTION. Past the sledgehammers. One missing...


A GRAINY PICTURE OF MCCALL

From the SECURITY CAMERA in the Russian Restaurant. Hardly damning until WE PULL BACK AND SEE...


MANDY - INSIDE HER ONE BEDROOM APARTMENT

Teri’s friend from the hospital, holding the photograph.

Surrounded by Teddy and his men...

MANDY
That’s him.	He came to the
hospital to see Teri.

The Men exchange looks.

Teddy takes the Photo from Mandy. Pats her shoulder as Masters drops the clear plastic bag over her head.

Mandy kicks out wildly as the Large Man holds the bag tight. The girl not going quietly. So Teddy jams his knife into her carotid. Bag splattering with blood...


EXT. DINER - NIGHT

The wall of windows that fronts the diner cast a dull orange glow on rain slicked street.

Inside McCall’s at his table. Doorman at the counter reading his newspaper. Counterman is behind the counter, changing out coffee filters.

Still life by Edward Hopper.
 
53.


The rain has the street outside quiet. A CON ED WORKER, exhausted from his shift walks up to the diner, hard hat, lunch bucket.


INT. DINER - NIGHT

The Con Ed Guy grabs the table near the window.

CON ED GUY

Coffee.

Counterman pours a cup and carries it out to the guy.

CON ED GUY (CONT’D)
Egg sandwich, on a roll.	With
cheese.

Counterman back into the kitchen. McCall reading. Doorman checks the scores.

Quiet.

Con Ed guy stirs cream into his cup. The only SOUND is the clinking of the spoon.

The CRINKLE of PAPER. Doorman folds his Daily News and leaves.

Quiet.

Con Ed guy sips his coffee.	Yawns.	Long day.

McCall pours more hot water over his tea bag. Looks around for something. Then across the room to Con Ed Guy’s table and finds it. Bowl of sugar packets.

Walks over.

MCCALL

Can I grab a sugar?

Con Ed guy slides the bowl towards McCall. About to go back to his coffee when his eyes catch sight of McCall’s table.

On it a bowl full of sugar packets.

Looks up JUST AS MCCALL THROWS THE STEAMING CUP OF COFFEE IN HIS FACE..
 
54.


Con Ed Guy’s SCREAM is cut off as McCall’s hand cracks the man’s windpipe.

Con Ed Guy drops off his chair - Mac-10 Machine Pistol under his coat clatters to the floor.

McCall looks towards the street...


JUST AS THE WINDOWS EXPLODE IN A SHOWER OF GLASS

As automatic weapon fire strafing the interior.

McCall bellies to the floor. Arms pulling down tables as shields...

Grabbing a table knife and JAMMING IT INTO A WALL OUTLET...

A FLASH and the ELECTRICITY SHORTS OUT. Everything plunged into darkness.

Except for the LASER TRACERS that dot the room followed by bullets that destroy EVERYTHING...

.30 caliber shells SHREDDING WALLS, FURNITURE, GLASSWARE...

every possible square inch of space.


REAR OF THE DINER

Counterman stumbles from the back confused...

BULLETS dance across the COUNTER ripping up the Formica...

About to cut Counterman to shreds WHEN...

McCall tackles Counterman to the floor just as...

The deadly fusillade of metal SPRAYS OVER THEM.

McCall laying his body over Counterman UNTIL...

The shooting stops...

Silence.

Far off a CAR ALARM BLARES.

Somewhere a BABY CRIES...

The last piece of glass drops with a gentle ping.
 
55.


EXT. DINER - NIGHT

FIVE LARGE MEN DRESSED IN BLACK. Suppressed HK 416’s with Holographic Scopes and Thermal-mounted Screens... LASER SIGHTS dancing across every surface.

Team Leader looks to 3, 4 and 5 and gestures them to the back alley...

Team Leader and his COHORT step into the Diner like shadows...


EXT. STREET

BLACK VAN idling a half a block down from the Diner...


INSIDE THE VAN

TWO ARMED KILLERS sit in the front seat listening in on the RADIO COMMUNICATION.

IN THE BACK GPS satellite FEEDS, MONITORS with VIDEO IMAGES of the DINER and the surrounding streets...

Teddy and his Three Men watch intently. Teddy leans into the RADIO MIKE...

TEDDY
I’m waiting for the fucking

confirmation!


FRONT OF DINER

Leader and Cohort sweep the room. Nothing but the barely breathing Con Ed Guy. Moving around the counter towards the back...


INT. DINER, BACK ROOM - NIGHT

McCall drags Counterman and shoves him under a counter.


BACK ALLEY

3, 4 and 5 converge on the Diner’s FIRE EXIT DOOR.
 
56.


INT. STORAGE ROOM

McCall steps around BOXES of CANNED GOODS and reaches for Fire Door EXIT...


BACK ALLEY

3, 4 and 5 on either side of the door.	Guns raised...

Eyes riveted to the HANDLE...

SOUND OF METAL ON BRICK...

5 looks up...

AIR CONDITIONING UNIT falling out of the wall and crushing his skull...

3 and 4 distracted JUST ENOUGH for...


THE BACK DOOR

To EXPLODE OPEN - McCall like the blade of a scythe. Grabs 3 before he can raise his weapon. Using his BODY as a shield as 4 fires...

Bullets hitting 3 center mass. 3’s GUN going off and blowing HOLES across 4’s chest.


THE BACK ALLEY

Team Leader and COHORT stepping out to find the bodies and NO MCCALL. Stares down the inky blackness of the Alley...

Leader flicks the switch on his weapon-mounted SCREEN.


ON THE SCREEN

THERMAL IMAGES sweeping across the darkness...

Electrical boxes on the sides of buildings, power lines above GLOW RED AND ORANGE... ANYTHING radiating HEAT above 72 degrees appears.

Further down the Alley... HEAT running along the brick and cement walls DANCE ACROSS THE SCREEN like spider veins.
 
57.


COHORT’S POV

Green tinged Night Vision. Trash and rats... The alley narrowing.

No place to hide...


TEAM LEADER

Movements precise and efficient.	Screen showing a BLIP.

Then...

HEAT IMAGE of a WARM BODY on the other side of a DUMPSTER.


ALLEY

Leader positions for a clear shot. HEARS the HISSING the second he PULLS THE TRIGGER...

Hollow Points blowing through the metal Dumpster. Hitting stone wall. Sparking and...

Igniting the BROKEN GAS LINE...

WHOOSH!	Knife-like WALL OF FLAME pierces the dark alley...


THROUGH NIGHT VISION GOGGLES

FIREBALL blinding them...


TEAM LEADER AND COHORT

Ripping off goggles...

McCall COMING FROM BEHIND THE FIRE... WHAM! Throats, arms, tendons snapping. Bodies collapsing

McCall not having broken stride as they fall... Keeps moving AS...


STREET VAN DOORS SLIDE OPEN

LAST TWO ASSASSINS jumping out...
 
58.


VAN ASSASSINS

Hitting the Alley on a dead run. Seeing McCall disappear around the final corner...

Getting to the...


END OF THE ALLEY

Open GRATING leading under the street open and still rattling...

ASSASSINS clear the opening and quickly lower themselves THROUGH THE OPENING.


DROPPING

Into COMPLETE DARKNESS below. Too inky to see anything except the GLOW of their LASER SIGHTS...

They stop and LISTEN for McCall.	Tasting blood...

They HEAR the RUMBLE a SPLIT SECOND BEFORE...

The BRIGHT LIGHT HITS THEM

WHAM!

SUBWAY CAR KILLING THEM INSTANTLY AS IT ROARS BY...

HOLD A BEAT after it's gone...


MCCALL

Steps out from a recessed DOORWAY IN THE SUBWAY TUNNEL.

Turns and heads down the tunnel like a Ghost...


INT. DINER - SAME TIME

Teddy and his Men in the middle of what’s left of the place.

The SOUND of shoes on glass as they walk...

MASTERS

Who the fuck is this guy?

Teddy carefully surveys the carnage.
 
59.


TEDDY

When I was at Coronado there were stories about a disavowed team operating out of Bahrain. Reeked havoc on networks and cells in the area. Six guys with skills so off the charts it seemed like a joke. Until I met them. Then I got it. These were guys with particular expertise.
(beat)
They mentioned there used to be a seventh. I think we just met him.

The gravity sinking in as POLICE SIRENS grow LOUDER and coming from ALL DIRECTIONS...

MASTERS

How do you want to play this?

Teddy stepping over to Con Ed Guy.	Picks up the Mac-10.

TEDDY
Bunch of Russians shooting each
other over weapons, drugs...
Classified investigation, need to
know, blah, blah...	I’ll handle
it.

Fires FOUR SHOTS into Con Ed Guy.

TEDDY (CONT’D)

Make sure they’re all like him.


MCCALL’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Teddy and his Guys are spread out in different rooms.

Surgically going through his place.

Teddy standing in the LIVING ROOM studying the place like it was a puzzle.

Masters coming from the bathroom with empty prescriptions vials.

MASTERS

Coumadin and Precose.

Pederson appearing from the kitchen with receipts from trash.
 
60.


PEDERSON
Bunch a travel items purchased

three days ago.

Buddy peering over McCall’s open laptop.

BUDDY
Got a diabetic heart patient
traveling internationally.
(pointing to laptop)
Bought a plane ticket to Columbia
day before yesterday.

TEDDY

Guy was prepared for this. He’ll have his next 10 moves worked out. That means we’re nine behind him.


EXT. MCCALL’S APARTMENT BUILDING

Teddy and his Men exit the walk-up and slip into their double-parked Suburban.

TEDDY (OS)
Call DHS.	Fill ‘em in.	Call
McCall a person of interest.

Detain only status.

Suburban pulling into traffic.	WATCHING this from...


MCCALL’S POV

On a rooftop across the street.


INT. MCCALL’S APARTMENT

McCall in the living room. Righting an overturned plant. Fixing the couch cushions. Opens a window to let some air in.

That’s when he feels the warmth trickling down his leg.

Looks at the blood pooling around his shoes.
 

Only now realizing the he’s been shot...
 
61.


SHOWER

Blood mixes with the water as it runs over the holes just above McCall’s hip. Entrance wound in back smallish. Exit wound ugly and jagged...


KITCHEN

McCall holds a dish towel over the wounds as he removes a pot of honey from the stove.


ON THE WOUNDS

As McCall uses a wooden spoon to slather the boiling honey over the lesions. Cauterizing and disinfecting them. Winding gauze around his abdomen...


EXT. BOARDWALK - NIGHT

McCall on his bench.	Taking in the clear but chilly night.

Watching faces go by.	Families, kids, another world.

Some internal struggle taking place. For the first time, uncertainty clouds his thinking.

Eyes falling on that same shooting booth. Same father and son are back. Poor guy throwing dollar after dollar at the Barker and never coming close to winning that Sponge Bob.

That’s when McCall decides. It doesn’t have to be this way...


MCCALL’S APARTMENT HALLWAY

McCall removes the plants on top of the bookcase. Reaches inside the top shelf and WE HEAR a CLICK...

McCall slides the bookcase to the left. The entire unit rolling away to reveal...


A SAFE ROOM

The keeper of secrets.

Devoid of anything except the bags and boxes of a life once upon a time that sit untouched on the floor.
 
62.


A built-in shelving unit contains a few items we recognize: The car keys from Home Depot Thief. Handcuffs from one of Ralphie’s corrupt cops. Teri’s CD...

And the bloodied cell phone he took from Slavi.


BLACKBERRY SCREEN

List of phone numbers SCROLLS BY. One particular number occurring more often than the others.


MCCALL’S KITCHEN

McCall dialing the number.	RINGS once and WE HEAR...

TEDDY (OS)
You’ve reached my cell.	Leave a
message or call my office at 212-

246-7614.

McCall jots the number down.	Dials it.	After THREE RINGS...

SECRETARY (OS)

Agent Coleman’s office.

Pause.

MCCALL

I’m sorry. I was trying to reach someone else. Can you transfer me back to operator?

Two more RINGS and a FEMALE VOICE...

OPERATOR (OS)
Central Intelligence Agency.	How
may I direct your call?


INT. GRAND CENTRAL TERMINAL - DAY

Classic beaus arts decor, the night sky ceiling, the stone and ironwork never looked more ominous.

CROWDS of people rushing to and from trains.

McCall one of them. Disappearing into the tunnel of TRACK 17...
 
63.


EXT.	SHENANDOAH VALLEY - LATE AFTERNOON

Rolling meadows defined by old, split rail fences and farms dating back to the birth of this country. Great shadows of clouds blanket the green hillsides.

A nondescript RENTAL CAR winds its way across the Valley...


EXT. SMALL FARMHOUSE

The rental car rolls up a two-rut excuse for a driveway in the middle of nowhere heading towards a modest, farm house. Late 1800s, beautifully maintained.

A screen door swings open and JASON PLUMMER steps onto the porch.

Early 70s with serious, deep blue eyes that have seen most of what life can offer. Good and bad. Wears soft, comfortable clothes and a smile that matches.

Watches as McCall gets out. The two stare at each other for a long moment.

McCall walks up to the porch stairs.	No words are spoken.

But we feel something significant here as they walk inside.


INT.	DINING ROOM - DUSK

McCall, Plummer and his wife SUSAN sit at an old plank table. Lace table cloth, aged flatware and china, garden picked flowers.

The three eat in comfortable silence. No one feeling the need to ruin the meal.


INT. KITCHEN

McCall washing. Plummer drying. Susan brings in the empty serving trays. Exchanges looks with her husband then walks out for the rest.

PLUMMER
Stopped counting the reasons I

married that woman years ago.
 
64.


INT. STUDY

Well-worn early Native American. Pendleton blankets and throws. Fire going. McCall settled into a chair next to it. Plummer cracks walnuts on the couch.

Susan comes in with a tray of drinks. Sets it down on the slab of redwood that stands in for a coffee table. Hands McCall a cup of hot water and the exact tea bag we’ve seen him use at the diner.

After a beat of silence Plummer stands.

PLUMMER

Well. I’ll leave you two to catch up.

Susan waits for the door to close.	After a moment...

SUSAN

If you’ve come for my help I can’t give you any. I have no influence these days. I fly to DC three days a week. Sit in a office reserved for people with secrets too scary to let completely out of sight. I think they’re afraid I’m going to write a book or something. Apparently that’s what retired spooks do out here.

If McCall hears her he doesn’t let on. Finally takes his eyes from the fireplace. Looks at Susan...

MCCALL

What would the CIA have to do with a bunch of Russian pimps?

Susan processes the statement.	Her answer comes quickly.

SUSAN

Nothing. The CIA doesn’t care about pimps. Russian or otherwise. So start with the fact they weren’t pimps. Selling girls was a hobby.

Susan waits for McCall to process this.
 
65.


SUSAN (CONT’D)
Think Amazon.	Big.	All
encompassing.	Sells everything.
Place an order it’s delivered to
your doorstep.	Items are shipped
to you from various warehouses
across the country.
(beat)
Amazon employs teams to run those
hubs.
(beat)
The Russians - specifically, Vladamir Pushkin - are the black market Amazon. Gasoline, weapons, drugs, bonds, executions, extortion, secrets, you name it they provide it. Pushkin considers the US the biggest shopping mall in the world.
(beat)
You took out Pushkin’s East Coast
team.	Shut down a hub.	Your CIA
friends were paid to protect that
from happening.	Now they’re
looking for blood.
(beat)
More tea?


EXT. FARMLAND - NIGHT

Rolling hills likes waves on a black sea.

A long rail fence that disappears into the horizon. McCall and Susan leaning against it. Silhouetted by the cobalt night sky and lit by an old Coleman lantern.

A long moment.

SUSAN

When they told me you were dead, I didn’t believe it. Not from something as trivial as an IED. It just wasn’t you, Robert.
(beat)

That you’re alive is a relief. But not a surprise. Jason and I talked a great deal about you over the years. If anyone could have figured a way out.

66.

SUSAN (CONT'D)

A way to walk away for good, start fresh... it would have been you.
(beat)

Either way I figured I’d never see you again. Preferred it that way. I imagined you wandering the earth searching for some peace, some understanding of yourself. Wondering if you’d find it in time.

Lantern FLAME flickers in McCall’s eyes.

SUSAN (CONT’D)

In all my years as a handler there was no one ever like you. Your skills were undefinable. A mind that saw things no one else did. In ways no one else could.
(beat)
What you did for your country
cannot be measured.	You saved
lives too many to count.	Yet it
didn’t feel good to you.	Even
though what we did mattered, it

didn’t feel right to you.

MCCALL

I couldn’t see...

SUSAN

The meaning.	I know...

Flame starting to die out.

SUSAN (CONT’D)

The greatest violins cannot hear music. The most beautiful paintings cannot see the joy they bring. It’s simply the way it is.
(beat)

We can't all be heroes, Robert. Someone has to sit on the curb and clap as they go by.

A LONG silence.

MCCALL
I didn’t have to go there.	I
didn’t have to kill them.
 
67.


SUSAN

Yes you did.

McCall looks at Susan.

SUSAN (CONT’D)
It was clear.	It was just.	It
mattered.

A NIGHTHAWK swoops across the Valley. Gliding low in search of prey...

SUSAN (CONT’D)

We must be the thing we are. Your gift wasn’t right for our gray, murky world. Your soul needed black and white. A clear reason.
(beat)
You’re an instrument of justice,
Robert.	You can’t run from that.

Flame so low we can only see their eyes.

SUSAN (CONT’D)
But you knew this before you came

here.

Susan turns to look at McCall for the first time.

SUSAN (CONT’D)

You didn’t come here for help. You came here for permission.

McCall doesn’t move.	Knows it’s true.

SUSAN (CONT’D)

There were rumors about rogue CIA teams for years. Basically doing contract work for interests abroad.
(beat)

What you’re talking about is different. High level Field Agents on US soil. An arrangement with a Pushkin would make them extremely dangerous. Anyone perceived as a threat would be terminated.
(sighs)
Were I talking to anyone else my
advice would be this: Minneapolis
is wonderful this time of year.

68.

SUSAN (CONT’D)
(beat)
But I’m not.	I’m talking to a
force of nature.

Susan lifts the Coleman and turns it off. For a brief moment we are immersed in the absence of the light. When our eyes adjust, here, away from cities and the things of man, all seems right.

The two stand framed against this wonder. We can’t see them anymore. We just HEAR...

SUSAN (CONT’D)

All I can say is heaven help them.


INT. TEDDY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

An upscale LOFT in SOHO.

Teddy on a treadmill running hard.	Has been for some time.

Massive chest heaving as he pushes himself to the limit.


INT. TEDDY’S BATHROOM - NIGHT

A large shower already running. Teddy’s head under the steaming water. Letting the stream run over his face.

Looks down and realizes the water is pooling at his feet.

The drain is plugged.	Bends down to open it...

When lights go out.

TEDDY

What the...

Teddy slides opens the glass door and SEES...


MCCALL

Sitting on the closed toilet. Across the room from the shower. An electrical cord pulled from a lamp in his hand, ends stripped bare.

McCall stares at Teddy. A dark, hollow stare. Plugs the cord in.

Teddy starting to step out of the shower when McCall tosses the cord out like a fishing cast.
 
69.


Hits the water at Teddy’s feet sending a SHOCK through his body. Moving him back into the shower.

McCall pulls the cord back.

TEDDY

Who are you?

McCall stays quiet.

Teddy tries to move again. McCall snaps out the cord - shocking him again. Teddy jumps back.

Room filling with steam now... McCall’s image is getting faint. Ghost-like.

Begins touching the two ends of the cord together. Lighting his face through the mist in brief hypnotic flashes.

Teddy stays frozen in the shower.

TEDDY (CONT’D)
You don’t know who you’re fucking

with.

MCCALL

I know exactly.

TEDDY

If you did, this would be the last place you’d...

McCall throws the cord again. Hits the water... this time he leaves it a bit... SPARKS FLASH as Teddy trembles. The massive jolt surging through his body.

McCall snaps the cord back.

Teddy breathes heavy and braces himself against the walls of the shower. McCall sparking the ends of the wire again.

Steam getting thicker.	McCall’s image fainter.

MCCALL

Special Agent Theodore Coleman. CIA, NCS Division. Counter Intelligence, 9 years. 41. Ex-Navy Seal. Your liver enzymes are high. History of primary mitral valve prolapse.

70.

MCCALL (CONT'D)

It rains you walk with a limp because of the MCL injury you suffered in Kuwait never healed properly. I’ll show you the x-rays if you want.

TEDDY

You going to kill me, do it.

MCCALL

I don’t need to kill you like this. I can think of over 20 ways to kill you right now... in this room alone.

TEDDY

What do you want, McCall?
