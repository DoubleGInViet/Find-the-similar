McCall stares at Teddy through the dense steam... Almost disappearing.

Tosses the cord out again and leaves it. Teddy trembles as the VOLTAGE COURSES THROUGH HIS BODY. Eyes bulge, hands grip the sides of the shower...

When it’s almost too much to bear...

The cord snaps back.

Teddy falls in the shower GASPING for breath. Room now filled with steam. Can’t see more than a few inches. Out in the steam the cord ends spark like an orange beacon.

TEDDY (CONT’D)

WHAT DO YOU WANT?

MCCALL
I want us to be clear with one

another.

Teddy sees a wooden back brush. Grabs it and breaks the brush head off. Giving him a jagged sliver of wood.

Tries to SEE McCall through the steam. Can’t. Just his VOICE...

MCCALL (OS) (CONT’D) I’m going to take you down. Piece by piece. And everyone that’s with you.
 
71.


TEDDY

You think so...

MCCALL
I’m already doing it.	You just
have to decide who you’re more

afraid of...	me or Pushkin.

McCall SPARKS the ends together once more...

MCCALL (CONT’D)

Either way you’re done.

Teddy slides the glass door open a sliver...

MCCALL (CONT’D)

Be better all around if you turn yourself into IA. I’m offering you an out. I suggest you take it... Otherwise this will not end well

for you...

In ONE SWIFT MOTION Teddy throws the door open and JAMS THE WOOD SLIVER INTO THE WALL OUTLET! POWER to the HOUSE GOES OUT...

Teddy grabbing the GLOCK from under the towels and FIRING... PORCELAIN AND TILE SHATTERING as SIX ROUNDS EVISCERATES the TOILET...

Teddy moving naked through the steam and finding McCall gone.


TEDDY’S BEDROOM

Flushed and angry. Out into the hall, Glock in his hand, loaded and ready.

Slowly...


TEDDY

Clears the house. Room to room. Nothing. Gets to the FOYER and SEES he FRONT DOOR wide open...


EXERCISE AREA

Teddy grabbing his CELL off of the treadmill and DIALING.

Masters answers...
 
72.


TEDDY

He was here!

MASTERS

Who?

TEDDY

McCall!

MASTERS
He’s in Mexico City.	We just got
confirma--

TEDDY

HE WAS IN MY FUCKING HOUSE!

CLOSE ON the BACK OF TEDDY’S PHONE. An almost invisible CLEAR PLASTIC STRIP with faint circuitry running through it...


ON MCCALL

On HIS phone.	Ear piece in LISTENING TO...

TEDDY (OS)

Get a hold of everybody. I want a meet in 30.


INT. RADIO SHACK - LATER

McCall being handed a bag of CHEAP EQUIPMENT...


LEGAL PAD

Pen scribbling the name MASTERS on it. Names PEDERSON and BUDDY already on the page.


EXT. BATTERY PARK - DAY

Filled with FAMILIES and TOURISTS on this incredibly BRIGHT afternoon. Sailboats in the Harbour. The Circle Line Ferry chugging past the Statue of Liberty.

McCall on a picnic bench eating a salad. Pen and pad in front of him. HEADPHONES on. Head nodding in rhythm to what appears to be MUSIC.
 
73.


But really listening to...

TEDDY (OS)
Pederson takes the whore’s

apartment...

Stabs a plastic fork in his SALAD and takes a bite. Cheap Radio Shack Sound Amplifier under the table. $49.00 and good up to 100 feet. Pointed at...


TEDDY AND HIS MEN

Twenty yards away. Standing near the railing to the FERRY TERMINAL. Bodies tense and wound tight as steel tourniquets.

BUDDY
What’s he want?	I mean everybody
wants something.

TEDDY

He wants our heads. That’s all we need to know.


MCCALL

Writing the words Weak next to Buddy’s name.


PIER PARKING LOT

Jammed with CARS and SUV’s baking under a blazing sun.

Including Teddy’s. Under which McCall slaps a tiny GPS transmitter as he walks by.


INT. HOME DEPOT - SUPERVISOR’S OFFICE

McCall sitting across from the store’s SUPERVISOR Georgie.

MCCALL
Just a couple of days until I can

straighten it out.

GEORGIE

Hey. Family comes first. Marcus can cover your shift until Monday.
 
74.


INT. NAVIGATOR

Masters inside. Parked down the block from McCall’s Apartment Building. Eyes peeled.


INT. TAURUS - MOVING

Pederson passing the Check Cashing Place for the third time.

McCall’s bank/Credit card Statements on the passenger seat.


EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - MIDTOWN

A glass and steel monolith nestled in the 600 Block of Madison Avenue. No designation or name on the facade. But...


INT. CIA BUILDING LOBBY

Humming with SECURITY PERSONNEL.

Everybody emptying pockets and checked by GUARDS before stepping through SOPHISTICATED BODY SCANNERS.

Including Teddy and Buddy. Walking to the SECURE ELEVATORS where they wait in SILENCE.

Teddy playing the game with McCall in his head. After a moment...

TEDDY

Everybody cares about something...


EAST 19TH STREET

Rush hour TRAFFIC inches along. Staccato BURSTS of HORN and SQUEALING breaks. Buses heaving their hulks across lanes.

Weaving her way through it all comes...


TERI

Stepping between PARKED CARS and onto the sidewalk. Lugging her book bag halfway up the block.

Blissfully unaware of the TWO RUSSIAN MURDERERS sliding out of the Lincoln behind her.
 
75.


Predatory faces watching her enter her Five Story walk-up...


THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY

Teri trudges the final flight. Walks to the last apartment at the end of the hall. Unlocks the door and steps inside. SOUNDS of the CHAIN and DEAD BOLT follow.

A moment later the two Russians are on either side of Teri’s door. Pockets handgun heavy, assessing the locks. The LITTLE RUSSIAN pulls a set of tools...

The SOUND of GLASS BREAKING comes from somewhere down the adjoining hallway.

What happens next happens fast and like this: LARGE RUSSIAN (Mighty Joe Young with a brain) creeps along the wall to SEE what’s what.

Peers around the corner. The blow from the Fire Extinguisher collapses the front of his head like a soda can.

LITTLE RUSSIAN stunned for a split second. And that second gets him deceased.

McCall taking only one step and breaking his larynx before his weapon clears his belt.

The next thing WE SEE are their legs disappearing into the TRASH ROOM...


BASEMENT

TWO GUNS then BODIES tumbling from the trash chute and into the dumpster.


INT. TEDDY’S OFFICE

Typical Field Agent’s space.	File Boxes piled everywhere.

Six year old computer tied to a secure line.

Teddy at the window pondering the next move when his CELL RINGS. Recognizes the number and picks up.

TEDDY

Better be what I want to hear.
 
76.


MCCALL (OS)

Depends on what you were expecting. I suspect you’re a tad disappointed already.

Teddy doesn’t move.	You’d swear his pulse actually DROPS.



COMMUNICATIONS ROOM

SCREENS with CAMERA FEEDS from HOT AREAS in the City. SUBWAY PLATFORMS, BRIDGES, TUNNELS etc.

SEVERAL TACTICIANS wearing HEADSETS monitor WIRELESS COMMUNICATION.

Teddy striding in.	Slides the Mobile number in front of TACT

1.	It’s quickly punched into the system which begins triangulating McCall’s number.

ON THE SCREEN WE SEE the SIGNAL AREA shrinking rapidly...

TEDDY

Gotta tell you I consider myself a smart guy. Still can’t figure this. Why you...

MCCALL (OS)

Kick over a rock most of the time something crawls out from under it.
(beat)
You’re misfortune is I’m the one

who kicked over yours.

Teddy watching the SCREEN as the ADDRESS SCROLLS ACROSS THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN. Tactician 1 turning to Teddy.

TACT I
Isn’t that Agent Pederson’s

address?


INT. PEDERSON’S HOUSE

McCall in the Office. Flash Drive just about done copying files from Pederson’s LAPTOP.
 
77.


TEDDY’S OFFICE - SAME TIME

Teddy back at his window. Dull eyes watching the sun set between the buildings. Resignation washing over him.

INT. HOME DEPOT, EMPLOYEE ENTRANCE - NIGHT

Ralphie standing by the front door with his keys. Young Dudes looking spiffy heading home for the weekend.

YOUNG DUDE 2
Saturday night.	Big mash up at
Brian’s.	You down for that?

YOUNG DUDE 1
Like five bucks an hour.	Plus
tips.

RALPHIE

Tips?

YOUNG DUDE 1
Need a Security dude to watch the
liquor.	Bring your mace can,
Rambo.

RALPHIE

Fuck you...

Good natured LAUGHS as the Dudes head off.

Ralphie about to the lock the door when a man steps inside.

RALPHIE (CONT’D)

We’re closed...

Ralphie looks up into the face of Masters who shows him the Beretta jammed into his belt.

MASTERS

Don’t be a hero, Chubs.


INTERNET CAFE

McCall sifting through Pederson’s FILES. Processing what he’s seeing. From his look, something surprising...
 
78.


EXT. 34TH STREET - MCCALL

Man on a mission now. Swallowed up by Rush Hour foot traffic near Penn Station. Dialing the PRE-PAID CELL as he crosses 34th Street...

TEDDY (OS)

I was hoping you’d call.

MCCALL

Found your money.

TEDDY
Figured you would.	You can’t get
to it.	Or prove it’s mine...

MCCALL
Making assumptions like that is

dangerous.


TEDDY

Walking through the PARKING GARAGE underneath his building. Oddly calm. His eyes saying... this was fun while it lasted.

TEDDY

Know the difference between me and you?

MCCALL (OS)

Where should I begin.

Teddy slides into his vehicle.

TEDDY

I don’t give a shit. About anything. But you do. And that puts a big bulls-eye on your back. Took me a while to figure it out.
(beat)
I’ll be laser straight with you. Thirty minutes. Boat Basin. Just me and you.

MCCALL (OS)

Or?
 
79.


Teddy pulls a piece of paper from his jacket pocket.

Reads...

TEDDY
Ralph Marquez, Jennifer Gould,
Manny Ramirez and the six other
Orange vests won’t be going home

tonight.


MCCALL

Stopping in the cross walk.	Bumped and jostled by COMMUTERS.

TEDDY (OS)
Violence without a message is a
waste of movement.	Don’t you
think?

HOLD on McCall’s face.	Audio collapse washing over him.

Suddenly the city, its noise, its commotion doesn’t exist.

Eyes flat and hard. Whatever forms this man’s soul begins to spread through his entire body.

When his answer comes it’s soft and measured.

MCCALL

Alright.	We’ll play this your way.

Cuts off the call. Thinks for moment. Then looks down at his wristwatch...

And starts the Stopwatch ticking...


INT. HOME DEPOT - DUSK

Masters walking Ralphie to the back of the store. Meeting up with Buddy and Pederson who have Jenny, Manny and SEVERAL OTHERS.

At the SAME TIME...


DOORS TO A MIDTOWN BUS OPEN

McCall stepping onto the M4 headed downtown. Taking a seat near the MIDDLE EXIT DOORS. Pulling out another PRE-PAID CELL PHONE from the Radio Shack bag. Powering it up.
 
80.


With his other hand punches numbers into HIS cell phone.

Forwarding HIS NUMBER to the Pre-paid Phone...


HOME DEPOT - TOOL REPAIR AND RENTAL SECTION - SAME TIME

Sectioned off by a chain link fence. Employees herded into the area by Teddy’s Guys.


PARKING LOT - VARIOUS AREAS - SAME TIME

Over the rise WE SEE the dark gleaming grill of a black SUV roll into a lot.

Then another. And another. SIX identical black SUVs, ominous and forboding, pulling onto the asphalt surrounding the premises.

PULLING BACK TO SEE...

SUVs ringing the perimeter of the structure. INSIDE each sit TWO RUSSIAN KILLERS.


IN ONE OF THE SUVS

Russian 7 checks the load in his Glock. Russian 8 on his RADIO with Masters.

RUSSIAN 8

We’re here.

MASTERS (OS)

Lock down the perimeter. Shoot anyone who looks like him that gets within 20 yards of the place.


HOLDING AREA

Masters clicks off as Pederson comes back with a handful of NYLON wire WRAPS. Tosses them to Ralphie.

PEDERSON

Behind their backs.	Tight.

Teddy smiles.	DIALS...


INT. DOWNTOWN BUS

McCall not on it.	CAMERA MOVES under the seat he was in...

McCall’s Cell Phone under it.	RINGS SILENTLY...


MCCALL

Someplace else and moving ANSWERS the Pre-Paid Phone.

TEDDY (OS)
Thought you might go ICBM on me.
You’re making the right decision.
For better or worse it was always

going to end this way..

McCall keeps moving.

MCCALL
Yeah well, there are some worsts

nobody ever thinks about.

Click.


EXT. HOME DEPOT PARKING LOT - SAME TIME

TWO of the SUVs idling within sight of each other.


INSIDE ONE

RADIO PLAYS Curren$y. Russian 1 behind the wheel bouncin’ to it. Not understanding a word.

Looks out his window at the SUV across the way. Guys with their feet up on the dash talking to one another.

Back to his MUSIC. Turns it up. Adjusts bass. Likes it more. Glances back to the other SUV...
 

No one’s in it.
 
82.


Looks around the parking lot. Nothing. Sits up. Turns to his partner.

RUSSIAN 1

Hey...

He’s asleep.	Shakes him and the man falls forward.

Sharp object protruding through the back of his seat, disappearing into the man.

Russian 1 spins quickly towards the back seat.

McCall.

And that’s the last thing he sees.


INT. HOME DEPOT, HOLDING AREA - NIGHT

Employees on the floor. Hands tie-wrapped behind their backs. Just the SOUND of breathing...

Masters rolls the gate shut. Locks it with a padlock. Takes out his phone and starts to dial when...

Kool and the Gang begins playing over the store’s PA System.

All three snapping into tense mode.	Guns coming out...

Masters unlocks the cage.	Points his weapon at Ralphie.

MASTERS

Where’s that coming from?


DEPOT AISLE

Masters and Pederson follow Ralphie as they make their way through the empty aisles. Guns are drawn. MUSIC drifting from the SPEAKERS above.

KOOL (VO)
Oh yes it’s Ladies Night and

feelin’s right...


SECURITY OFFICE

Masters pushes Ralphie into the office as Pederson clears it.
 
83.


Empty.

CD player patched into the PA system. Power on. Masters hits stop and it’s suddenly QUIET again.

MASTERS

Who else is here?

RALPHIE

No one.	I swear...

Pederson grabs Masters arm. Points him to the SECURITY MONITORS.

Masters follows his look to CAMERA 16.	Middle of the store.

A LONE FIGURE moves like a Ghost down a center aisle.

MASTERS
(into his Radio)

He’s in the fucking store!


DOORS TO THE VANS AND SUVS OPEN

A wave of icy death pour out of the vehicles jacking their automatic weapons and fan out.

Split into GROUPS and head for the various entrances to the store.


MASTERS AND PEDERSON

Throwing Ralphie back into the Holding Area. Tie-wrapping his hands to the gate, padlocking it with Buddy inside.

MASTERS
We don’t come back...	kill ‘em
all.

Masters goes to call Teddy. Gets no signal. Looks up and follows Pederson’s eyes to the AWNING WINDOWS near the ceiling.
 

Everyone of them covered in TIN FOIL. Blocking the Cell signals in and out...
 
84.


BOAT BASIN - SAME TIME

Teddy opening the trunk and removing the standard issue Remington 12 gage. Cradles it under his arm and checks his PDA.

McCall’s signal closing in...

INT. HOME DEPOT - VARIOUS AREAS - NIGHT

Silent. Nobody moving. Store quiet and empty. Aisles deserted. Place feels feral and dangerous.

That’s when THE POWER GOES OUT. ENTIRE STORE plunged into blackness.
 
85.


OUTSIDE THE HOLDING AREA

Masters feels the chill run down his spine. Flips the safety off...


HOME DEPOT - WIDE

Dark FIGURES moving into the belly of the store from every conceivable angle...


RUSSIANS 4, 5, 6 AND 7

Walking slowly.	Every SOUND HEIGHTENED.


RUSSIANS 8 AND 9

Kel-Tec Shotguns on their hips. Eyes scanning every shadow and space.


RUSSIANS 1, 2 AND 3

Fan out.	Each taking a different aisle.


RUSSIANS 2 AND 3

Start down LIGHTING FIXTURES. Broken BULBS litter the middle of the aisle where someone ransacked the shelves...


RUSSIAN 1

Steps into the PAINT SECTION.	SEES...

TARPS, PAINT CANS and A HALOGEN WORK LIGHT splayed across the floor... Slowly maneuvers around the mess... Stepping over the Halogen stand WHEN...


THE LAMP BLAZES ON

Momentarily blinding Russian 1. Turns his head away and finds the spectre of...
 
86.


MCCALL

Who JAMS his thumb into the Russian’s eye. Then his throat. Cutting off his ability to make sound. WHAM! WHAM! Two thumbs into his ribs and diaphragm.

Russian 1 doubling over. Making it easier for McCall to snap his neck.

Checks his watch.


GARDEN AISLE

Russians 2 and 3 walk with purpose...


BATHROOM FIXTURE AISLE

Russian 4 sweeps his gun across the area...


RUSSIAN 3

Hardware Section. Mid-aisle. Stops and listens. HEARS a SNAPPING SOUND one aisle over.

Quietly pushes aside some boxes on the SHELVING UNIT.

Creating space TO SEE INTO THE NEXT AISLE.	REVEALING...


MCCALL

Pulling the trigger on the PNEUMATIC NAIL GUN. SINGLE CEMENT ANCHOR THUDDING into Russian 3’s FOREHEAD.

Pulls the spent CO2 cartridge out and pops in another...


RUSSIANS 5, 6 AND 7

Stepping around the corner.	SEEING their dead comrade.

Faces twists into a masks of rage.

Anger blinding them as they stalk down...


THE APPLIANCES AISLE

In and around the REFRIGERATORS. Past the WASHERS AND DRYERS...
 
87.


Then a HUMMING SOUND. Stop... listen... Eyes following the SOUND to...


THE DISPLAY OF MICROWAVES

Timers ticking down. Russian 5 leans down and looks inside...


THROUGH THE MICROWAVE WINDOW

A small propane tank turning slowly on the plate.

BOOM!!!!

THE WALL EXPLODES INTO FLAMES. A HUGE FIREBALL engulfing all three Russians. Bodies catching fire...


INT. HOLDING AREA

The SOUNDS coming from inside the store waft over Ralphie and the other hostages. The SCREAMS frighten them into puddles...

Buddy backs away from the gate.


RUSSIAN 8 AND 9

HEARING the SCREAMS.	Following them into...


THE APPLIANCE AISLE

Where Russians 5,6 and 7 lay smoldering. Flesh burning off their bones.



Fear now fills their souls. 8 and 9 exchange looks, turn and BOLT...

Racing like the wind towards...


THE EMPLOYEE ENTRANCE

Where they STOP DEAD.
 
88.


EMPLOYEE ENTRANCE DOOR

Chained and padlocked. From the inside. While on the OTHER SIDE of THE STORE...


MASTERS AND PEDERSON

Stare grimly at...


THE FRONT ENTRANCE

Titanium bicycle chain run through the door handles and locked.


BOAT BASIN - SAME TIME

Teddy waiting just off the rutted path. SEES McCall’s signal has stopped two hundred yards away. Not moving.

Dials...


MCCALL - DEEP IN THE STORE

Picks up after the first VIBRATION.

TEDDY (OS)

Second thoughts?

MCCALL
Just taking care of a few things.

Be right with you.


LASER DOTS

Dance across SHELVING AND MATERIALS. Stepping from the SHADOWS come...


RUSSIANS 3, 8 AND 9

Shoulder to shoulder. Fingers on triggers. Precision movements.
 
89.


A GLIMPSE OF MCCALL

Moving quickly across the aisle.


THE RUSSIANS

Fire their weapons. Shredding everything in its path. When it settles... No McCall.


HOLDING AREA

ECHOING GUNSHOTS shatter the SILENCE. Too much for Buddy. Feeling like a trapped animal so he unlocks the Cage, steps out and re-locks it. WHISPERS into his RADIO...

BUDDY

Where the fuck are you guys?


MCCALL

Like a shadow.	Moving towards the final area of the store.
Oddly calm.	Breathing measured.	Just the tick... tick...
tick of his watch...


MASTERS AND PEDERSON

In the LUMBER SECTION. Anxious and on edge. Masters clicks on his RADIO.

MASTERS

Stay with the Hostages.


MCCALL - SOMEWHERE

Pulls BOXES OF ROOFING NAILS AND BRADS off the shelves as he walks...


RUSSIANS 3, 8 AND 9

In the PLUMBING SECTION. Every SOUND amplified. 3 hand signals he’s splitting off...
 
90.


MCCALL’S HANDS - SOMEWHERE ELSE

Grabbing a GARAGE DOOR REMOTE PACKAGE from a rack of them.


AN X-ACTO KNIFE

Slices open an bag a FERTILIZER.	Then ANOTHER...


RUSSIANS 8 AND 9

Move down the BATHROOM FIXTURE SECTION. Turning the corner and...

SEEING McCall DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF THEM!

EMPTYING THEIR WEAPONS INTO HIS BODY...

ONLY TO SEE MCCALL’S IMAGE SHATTER INTO PIECES as the MIRRORED GLASS EXPLODES INTO FRAGMENTS...

Understanding too late that...

He’s behind them.


MCCALL

Running the 6” Drywall Saw through 9’s third and fourth ribs. 8 getting his weapon halfway up when he looks down and SEES the Chisel protruding from his chest as he loses feeling in his extremities...


RUSSIAN 3

Alone. Shuddering in fear three aisles over. Gets to the end of PATIO FURNITURE AISLE. White knuckling his weapon. About to peek around the corner.

Never feeling the extension cord until it’s around his neck.

Body jerking like a marionette until... it isn’t.

McCall gently drops the body onto the floor.


MASTERS, PEDERSON AND BUDDY

Coming together from different areas. Converging at the rear of the store.
 
91.


Wound tight. No longer smug. Eyes darting all over the place.


HOME DEPOT - HIGH ANGLE

NINE BODIES strewn about in VARIOUS SECTIONS. The last three men standing in the shadows. Knowing McCall could be anywhere...

About to head back into the middle of the store when...


MASTERS

SEES the shadow slip into the far rear section of the place.

Motions to the others...


GARDEN AREA

Like a GIANT GREENHOUSE. A large area filled with PLANTS AND TREES and GARDENING EQUIPMENT.


MASTERS, PEDERSON AND BUDDY

Stand at the ONLY ENTRANCE to the area. Hearts beating hard and fast. Knowing McCall is here.

Using hand signals MASTERS points Pederson and Buddy down separate aisles.


THE MEN MOVE SLOW

Every step painful.	Bile and dread inching up their throats.

Finally reaching the...


CENTRAL GARDEN AREA

FOUNTAINS, BIRDBATHS and WIND CHIMES. Against the back wall ALL kinds of PLANTING SUPPLIES.


MCCALL

Against the back wall in the shadows. Just the whites of his eyes visible. Standing amongst the garden TOOLS and a row of STEEL WHEELBARROWS.
 
92.


MASTERS

HEARS that TICKING SOUND. FIRES a SHOT blindly into the shadows.


MCCALL

Waits.	Like a cobra.	All three Men stepping into range.

CAMERA pans down McCall’s body to his hand. Garage Door remote in it. Finger over the clicker.


MASTERS, PEDERSON AND BUDDY

Taking three steps closer. Then they HEAR it. Eyes falling on the wheelbarrow as it lowers over the kneeling body of McCall.

Exchange confused looks.

And at the exact same time realizing they’re surrounded by LUMPY bags of FERTILIZER. EMPTY BOXES OF NAILS scattered across the floor.


MCCALL’S FINGER

Pushes the Clicker on the Remote as...


MASTERS, PEDERSON AND BUDDY

Have just enough time to exchange one stupid look before...

BLAMMMMMM!!!!

FERTILIZER BAGS EXPLODING. Nails SCREAM through the air at the speed of sound. High pitched WHINES as the projectiles literally nail...


MASTERS, PEDERSON AND BUDDY

Faces and bodies riddled with the nails. Muscles, tendons and bone cut to pieces. Organs punctured and shredded.
 
93.


INSIDE THE WHEELBARROW

Nails THUNK and PIERCE the steel like quills. Stopping inches from McCall’s body.


MASTERS

Barely alive. Bleeding from places he didn’t know could bleed. Stumbling to his feet. SEEING his dead Partners.


SO HE RUNS

Knees pumping like out-of-sync pistons. RACING towards the BACK OF THE STORE.


HOLDING AREA

Everyone in the cage frozen in fear. Except Ralphie. He’s furiously working on his tie wraps.

Almost gets them loose enough when Masters gun barrel slips through the fence and touches his forehead. Bloody face appearing against the chain link...


HOME DEPOT - FRONT OF THE STORE

Everything bathed in murky darkness. Nothing moves. The unearthly silent is shattered by...

MASTERS (OS)

MCCAAAAAAAAAAALLLLL!

The animalistic cry ECHOES throughout the cavernous store.

Then Ralphie appears out of the shadows.

BARREL OF MASTERS REVOLVER DUCT-TAPED TO HIS TEMPLE...

Masters PRESSED UP against Ralphie’s back. DUCT TAPE WEAVING ITS WAY AROUND HIS GUN HAND. COVERING HIS FINGER ON THE TRIGGER.

The only thing visible is the COCKED HAMMER...

MASTERS (CONT’D)
HEY!	I FLINCH, TRIP, I FUCKING
HICCUP HE’S DEAD!	UNDERSTAND???
 
94.


Ralphie’s eyes squeezed tight. Barely holding it together. In his trembling hand is a bolt cutter. Price tag still attached.

MASTERS (CONT’D)

I’M WALKING OUT OF HERE NOW!


MCCALL

Somewhere in the darkness. Eyes studying the impossible. Baretta M9. 4 pounds of pull making it a hair trigger for all intent and purpose. Duct tape masking the exact position of the trigger finger...

Reaches down and grabs the long barrel M16-A out of Russian 4’s dead hand. Flips on the LASER SCOPE. Takes a breath...

And steps back into the darkness...


MASTERS AND RALPHIE

At the FRONT ENTRANCE. Bicycle Chain the only thing between Masters and freedom.

MASTERS

Cut it.

Ralphie’s sweat covered hands fumble with the cutters.

Masters pressing the barrel harder into the kid’s temple.

Ralphie manages to cut one length of the chain. Places the teeth of the cutters over the last piece.

Masters eyes DART INTO THE DARKNESS OF THE STORE. No McCall. Eerie and way too quiet. Then SEES the FAINT GLOW of RED coming from the far aisle...

Looks down...

LASER DOT ACROSS THE DUCT TAPE where is hand would be... Masters JERKS RALPHIE around! SPINNING HIM SO THE DOT IS ON HIS CHEST...

MASTERS (CONT’D)

YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?
 
95.


MCCALL’S MOUTH

Right next to Masters ear.

MCCALL

It look like I’m kidding?


HARD CUT - THE M-16

Propped up on a shelf all by itself at the end of the aisle.


MCCALL AND MASTERS

Masters’ eyes GO WIDE as McCall’s arm snaps around his neck.

Masters squeezing the trigger...

But nothing happens.

Masters’ confused. Looks down and SEES THE CARPET KNIFE JAMMED INTO THE HOLLOW OF HIS TRICEP.

MCCALL
Brachial tendon’s severed, Slick.
You got nothing from the shoulder
down...

Box Cutter slices the barrel from Ralphie’s head. Ralphie falling to his knees. McCall twisting the dead arm towards Masters chest.

MCCALL (CONT’D)

So let me help you.

McCall touches Master’s finger. The Gun FIRES a single MUFFLED SHOT into Master’s heart.


HOME DEPOT -WIDER

Masters dead before he hits the floor. McCall reaches down and takes the keys from his belt. Walks over to Ralphie. Helps him to his feet.

Shock and awe plastered all over Ralphie’s face. Staring at McCall like he was some apparition. McCall drops the keys to the Cage and a pair of pliers into Ralphie’s hand.

MCCALL

You should go let them out.
 
96.


Ralphie nods.

MCCALL (CONT’D)
I don’t know if you heard.	I’m
away on a family matter.	I’ll be
back Monday.

A LONG beat.	Then Ralphie smiles.


INT. TEDDY’S CAR - BOAT BASIN

Teddy getting in. Tossing the Shotgun into the back seat when his Cell RINGS. UNKNOWN NUMBER appears on the screen. Answers and HEARS...

MCCALL (OS)

Run.


EXT. CREDIT SUISSE BANK BUILDING

A glass and steel modern structure with spiraled columns designed to support nothing except public awe and reverence.

Teddy coming out of the Bank pocketing AN ENVELOPE. Hits the remote. About to climb in when HE SEES...

TWO suit-clad MEN on the near corner. Eyes directly on Teddy.

Now SEES another TWO MEN on the far corner.

Looks across the street... FOUR MORE MEN in SUITS. ALL looking at Teddy.

MILLER (OS)

Agent Coleman...

Teddy spins. TWO DARK BLUE SUITS, matching haircuts and implacable faces behind him. Agency ID’s in their hands.

WARD
Special Agent Ward.	This is Agent
Miller.	CIA Internal Affairs.


INT. SEDAN - MOVING

Miller behind the wheel. Ward shotgun. Teddy behind the chicken wire screen in the back.
 
97.


Hands cuffed behind his back.


EXT. BATTERY PARK

Tip of Manhattan. Down Battery Place then taking a DETOUR. Crossing Water Street. The sedan jumps down a one lane dirt road that cuts a swath through a path of dense foliage.


INT.	SEDAN - BACK SEAT

Teddy looking around. SEES the CITY being swallowed up by the overgrown TREES...

TEDDY

Where the fuck we going?


EXT. THE SEDAN - DAY

Road getting smaller, foliage thicker. Rusted out boat trailers litter the shoulder.

We’re at the abandoned Boat Basin.


INT. THE SEDAN

Through the windshield foliage clears and the Harbour comes into VIEW.

The car bumps along a bit further then stops a few yards above the water line.

Miller and Ward exit the vehicle without a word leaving Teddy alone.

After what seems like an eternity the drivers side door opens and McCall slides in.

McCall doesn’t turn around.

MCCALL

It was your idea to meet here.

Now shifts so he can look directly at Teddy.

MCCALL (CONT’D)
It’s important you understand

everything.
 
98.


TEDDY

I understand enough.

MCCALL

I don’t think you do.

A long pause.	McCall lowers the back windows a few inches.

MCCALL (CONT’D)

The place we choose to inhabit, to live our lives, is like it’s own ecosystem. Ecosystems only survive when there’s balance. Otherwise there’s chaos, corruption and injustice.
(beat)

People like you upset that balance.

TEDDY
What the fuck are you talking
about?	It was bad guys killing
worse guys.	You don’t think that
exists every fucking place in the

world?

MCCALL

It does. I’ve seen it. But you’re in my world. And that’s...

unacceptable.

TEDDY

Wake up you self-righteous prick. The whole cake’s been divided down to the last crumb. You take what you can get when you can get it.
(beat)
I didn’t design the system.	I
simply learned how to play it and
win it.
(beat)
I got seven million dollars in my
pocket.	It’s yours.	Take it.
Dole it out to your ecosystem

McCall cracks the front windows. Stares out at the water for a few moments.

MCCALL
Most people don’t want anything
except fairness.

(MORE)
 
99.

MCCALL (CONT'D)

More and more they feel they can never have it. They see bigger, richer, more corrupt, morally bankrupt, spiritually vacant people get it all. The ones who don’t give a shit...

Turns the ignition key halfway.	Engine light coming on.

Turns around and starts going through Teddy’s pocket.

MCCALL (CONT’D)
You’re a bad guy, Teddy.	Worse,
you’re a bad guy who doesn’t give a
shit.	About anyone.	Even
yourself.	And that makes you more
frightening than almost any monster

out there.

McCall finds the check.	Sits back and looks at the amount.

Whistles. T eddy laughs.

TEDDY

Lot of money. Don’t be so smug. In my ecosystem I’ll do four years in some country club prison, get out, move to Dubai. Sell my knowledge and services to some Sheik who likes the idea of having an ex-CIA Agent on his staff. In two years, I’ll be a millionaire all over again.

McCall takes the check and sticks it on the rearview mirror.

MCCALL

Guess you can take it with you.

Slips the car into neutral then opens the door.

TEDDY

Hey!


EXT.	BOAT BASIN

McCall steps out and closes the door. The car starting to roll down the embankment...

TEDDY

HEY!
 
100.


McCall watches as the car lists down the embankment towards the water. Watches Teddy panic in the back seat, face twisted in impotent fury.

Front end of the car hitting the WATER... Teddy pressing his face to the small opening on the window.

TEDDY (CONT’D)

What’s this make you?

McCall doesn’t bother to answer.

The car sinking, hood already submerged. Water rushing through the open windows... Teddy staring through the back window.

Into McCall’s eyes. McCall doesn’t look away. Resignation washing over Teddy. Both men now calm, dispassionate... Water rising above Teddy’s chest, chin, then his face...

Finally the car disappearing under water.


MCCALL

Waits a long moment. Turns and walks up the embankment.

Crosses the road where ANOTHER CAR WAITS.

Walks over to it and gets in the back...


INT. CAR

Susan Plummer sits in the back. Miller and Ward silently up front.

The two exchange looks. Ward puts the car in gear and drives off.


EXT. MCCALL’S APARTMENT BUILDING

Car pulling up out front.


INT. CAR

Susan glances up at McCall’s apartment building.

SUSAN

I expected more.
 
101.


MCCALL

It’s enough.

Starts to get out.	Stops.	Turns back to Susan.

MCCALL (CONT’D)
He asked me, doing that, what it

made me...

Susan thinks.	Then looks at her old friend.	Smiles.

SUSAN

Life is a fight. But not everyone’s a fighter. That’s where you come in, Robert.
(beat)
You’re an equalizer.

McCall lets it sink in. Gets out without another word and the car drives away.


INT. HOME DEPOT - MORNING

CLEAN UP CREWS still working as EMPLOYEES drift in. Ralphie at his place by the front entrance when McCall and the Young Dudes step through.

Looks of surprise at the mess.

YOUNG DUDE 1

What the fuck?

YOUNG DUDE 2

What is this shit?

RALPHIE

You didn’t hear? Some guys broke in and took a bunch of us hostage. Was a big showdown and a bunch of guys got killed. No one’s telling us much else. Classified or something.

YOUNG DUDE 2
Well I ain’t cleanin’ that shit

up...

McCall starts to follow them into the store.
 
102.


RALPHIE

Mr. McCall?

McCall turns. Ralphie holds up the PAIR OF PLIERS with the price tag on it.

RALPHIE (CONT’D)

Mind putting these back for me?

The look that passes between them is understood instantly by both. This is our secret. And will remain so.

McCall smiles.	Takes the pliers and heads down the aisle.

Back to work...


EXT. CONEY ISLAND BOARDWALK - NIGHT

McCall on his favorite bench. Night air crisp and clean. Like McCall’s soul. There’s a tranquil, untroubled feeling to this man now.

Watches the United Nations of faces and families with different eyes.

Smiles at the Spanish woman fingering her rosary as she watches her daughter fly by on the Tilt-a-Whirl.

Her small son next to her playing Nintendo that probably cost her a months pay.

People trying.	That’s what counts.

McCall stands and starts for home.	Passes the...


SHOOTING BOOTH

Where that father and son are back. Trying again. Father handing over his last dollar only to get the same result. Takes his kids hand and about to slink off when...

MCCALL (OS)

Give the man a sponge guy already.

All three heads turn. McCall standing there, hands in his pockets.
 
103.


MCCALL (CONT'D)
Guy’s been here every Saturday
night for two months.	Paid for the
sponge ten times over.

BARKER

Who are you? The boardwalk police? Hit all six targets win the sponge guy.
(points to sign)
Or can’t you read.

And there’s that look again.

McCall steps to the counter and drops a dollar bill into the barker’s sweaty palm.

Turns to the father.

MCCALL

This one’s on me.

Lifts the beat up air rifle...	adjusts the aim and...

BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! All six targets nailed dead center in milliseconds.

Barker stands there slack-jawed as McCall grabs the LARGEST Sponge Bob and hands it to the Father. Kid’s eyes like saucers.

Places the rifle back onto the Barker.

MCCALL (CONT'D)
Site’s six degrees off to the left.

I’d fix that if I were you.

As he walks off...

MCCALL (CONT’D)

And I’ll be back to check.


INT. MCCALL’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

McCall at the Kitchen Table.	Laptop open.	Typing something.

WE HEAR MUSIC drift over the scene. Faint at first. Like it was coming through the open window.
 
104.


ON SCREEN

A CRAIGSLIST PAGE. Under the SERVICES subheading. McCall’s fingers writing a POST.

A VOICE now SINGING with the MUSIC.	A haunting SONG grows

LOUDER as WE SEE McCall’s words BEATING OUT ACROSS THE PAGE:

GOT A PROBLEM?

ODDS AGAINST YOU?

WRITE TO:

THE EQUALIZER


MCCALL

Stares at the screen. This is who he is now. At peace with that.

SONG getting LOUDER.	And as his finger presses SEND WE...

CUT TO:


A SMALL DIVE BAR

Somewhere in Hell’s Kitchen.	Dingy and dark and half full.

That SONG filling the ROOM.

On stage a PIANO PLAYER.

And Teri.

Singing the last notes with all her being. Heartbreakingly magicical...

The APPLAUSE more enthusiastic than expected.

The LOUDEST is McCall.	Against the back wall.


TERI

Walks off the stage and into the arms of a NICE LOOKING GUY. The look on his face tells us everything we need to know about her life now.
 
105.


MCCALL

Eyes bright with pride. Drops a twenty on the table and heads for the exit...

DISSOLVE TO:


EXT. DINER - EARLY EVENING

Maybe it’s the same diner fixed up. Maybe it’s a different one. Doesn’t matter. Because what’s the same is...

MCCALL

At a back table. Cup of tea. Book 94 open. “The Invisible Man” by Ralph Ellison.

And WE HOLD on this IMAGE for a few beats. Because it feels right and... just.

WE HEAR the faint DING of McCall’s CELL. Fishes it out and reads the email.

VOICE (OS)
I saw your ad and I am taking a
chance you are real.	I am
desperate.


SQUEALING TIRES OF A 757 HITTING THE RUNWAY...

VOICE (OS)

My family is in danger. The police cannot help.


INT. INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT TERMINAL

DOORS to CUSTOMS sliding open as McCall walks through them shouldering his bag

Sign above the doors says: WELCOME TO BRUSSELS


EXT. BRUSSEL’S AIRPORT

McCall coming out and walking to the curb.	Hails a taxi.
 
106.


VOICE (OS)

I know I am far away but I have no hope and nowhere else to turn. Can you help?

As the TAXI pulls curb side McCall slips a pair of SUNGLASSES on and WE GO TO...

BLACK
