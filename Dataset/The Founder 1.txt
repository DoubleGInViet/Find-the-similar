INT. ED’S DRIVE-IN - KITCHEN - DAY

The kitchen of a drive-in restaurant outside St. Louis. It’s 1954. Traveling salesman RAY KROC (52) stands before a sample MIXING MACHINE, making his pitch to the OWNER.

RAY KROC
Now, I know what you’re thinking:
“What the heck do I need a five-
spindle for? I barely sell enough
shakes to justify my single
spindle.” Right? Wrong.
(BEAT)
Mr. Paulsen, are you familiar with the notion of the chicken and the egg? I mention it because I believe it’s applicable here: Do you not need a Multimixer because you’re not selling enough milk shakes? Or are you not selling enough milk shakes because you don’t have a Multimixer? I firmly believe it’s the latter. You see, your customers, they know that if they order a shake from your establishment, it’s going to be a terrific wait. They’ve ordered one before, and by golly they’re not gonna make that mistake again. But if you had, say, a Prince Castle-brand five-spindle Multimixer with patented direct-drive electric motor, you could greatly increase your ability to produce delicious, frosty milk shakes fast. And before long, mark my words, dollars to donuts, you’d be selling more of those suckers than you can shake a stick at. Increase supply, demand will follow. Chicken and the egg. You follow my logic? Of course you do. You’re a bright, forward-thinking fella who knows a good idea when he hears it.
(BEAT)
So whaddaya say?

ON THE OWNER-- pondering thoughtfully.

OWNER
Nah.
(BEAT)

Thanks anyway.

EXT. ED’S DRIVE-IN - PARKING LOT - SHORT TIME LATER

Kroc lugs the heavy Mulitmixer back to his car. He lifts it into the trunk, wincing from his bad back.


INT. KROC’S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

Kroc sits in his car checking his APPOINTMENT BOOK. His next sales call: DEE DEE’S DRIVE-IN - 1 P.M.

He checks his watch. It’s 12:05. He turns on the car, pulls into a customer spot in front of Ed’s Drive-In.

He looks at the MENU BOARD, taking in the vast, seemingly random assortment of items: BBQ beef sandwiches, hot tamales, peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, chili dogs, etc.


INT. KROC’S CAR - SHORT TIME LATER

Kroc sits in his car, waiting for his food. He looks at his watch. It’s 12:50. He lets out a heaving, exasperated sigh.

KROC’S POV, the view out his windshield: a rowdy TEEN-HANGOUT SCENE. Rock-and-roll blasting from cars; female CARHOPS on rollerskates dodging grabby male patrons; leather-jacketed, cigarette-smoking hoodlums smacking each other around.

Kroc is the oldest customer by a mile--and seemingly the only one with anywhere to be. He HONKS his horn, summoning his CARHOP. She comes skating over holding a tray of Cokes.

RAY KROC
Miss, how much longer?

CARHOP GIRL
Should be any minute.

RAY KROC
You said that 20 minutes ago.

CARHOP GIRL
I’m sorry, we’re real--

She JUMPS-SQUEALS, startled. The tray of Cokes goes flying into the car, SPILLING ALL OVER KROC’S LAP. Several glasses and plates fall on the ground, SHATTERING.

Carhop Girl spins around, sees a GUY behind her cracking up.
He just pinched her butt.
 
3.


CARHOP
Dennis!
(re: Kroc, soaked)

Look what you made me do!

DENNIS
Sorry, gramps.

Dennis scampers off toward his pack of laughing friends. The carhop goes chasing after him, mad but not actually mad.

ON KROC-- looking down at the pool of bubbly brown liquid in his lap. He HONKS, leans out the window.

RAY KROC
Could I get some napkins?

No one hears him.


INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

ANGLE ON the pants drying on the shower’s curtain rod.

RAY KROC (O.S.)
It’s going great.

CUT TO: the NEXT ROOM. Kroc sitting on the bed, on the phone.

RAY KROC (CONT’D)
Lot of good leads today. Real

strong leads.

Through the phone, a tiny passive-aggressive sigh.

RAY KROC (CONT’D)
(prickly)

What?

ETHEL KROC (O.S.)
Nothing. That’s wonderful.

RAY KROC
There’s tremendous interest.

ETHEL KROC (O.S.)
I’m sure there is.

RAY KROC
You don’t believe me?

ETHEL KROC (O.S.)
Of course, Ray. Why wouldn’t I?
 
4.


SHORT TIME LATER--

Kroc sits on the edge of the bed, roiling from the call. He takes off his shirt, undressing for bed. His bare torso bears numerous surgery scars: heart, gall bladder, etc.

He reaches over to the night stand, grabs a fifth of Canadian Club. Unscrews the cap.


SHORT TIME LATER--

Kroc, in pajamas, stands before a PORTABLE PHONOGRAPH. He drops the needle on a record.


SHORT TIME LATER--

Kroc lies in bed in the darkened room, eyes closed. A soothing baritone fills the air--

RECORD (O.S.)
Nothing in the world can take the
place of persistence. Talent will
not; nothing is more common than

unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb.

ANGLE ON record sleeve next to the phonograph: “THE POWER OF THE POSITIVE” BY DR. CLARENCE FLOYD NELSON

RECORD (CONT’D)
Education will not; the world is
full of educated derelicts.
Persistence and determination alone

are omnipotent.

QUICK CUTS to other snippets of the record:

RECORD (CONT’D)
So I grabbed that brush, and I
shined up those boots so bright,
Pastor Walker could see his

reflection in them!

Later--

RECORD (CONT’D)
The lesson there being, it’s not what you do but how you do it. Any job worth doing is worth doing well.
 
5.


Later--

RECORD (CONT’D)
As I like to say, it’s not the size of the dog in the fight, it’s the size of the fight in the dog.

Later--

RECORD (CONT’D)
Misfortune is just a stepping stone

to fortune.

Later--

RECORD (CONT’D)
And I said to myself, “Clarence, you’ve got to muddle through this!”

Later--

RECORD (CONT’D)
How a man handles adversity is the true measure of a man.

Later--

RECORD (CONT’D)
Heck, anyone can paddle in a

sunshower!


INT. JOE’S DRIVE-IN - KITCHEN - NEXT DAY

The kitchen of another drive-in, Kroc pitching to the OWNER.
The scene is virtually identical to the previous day’s.

RAY KROC
Increase supply, demand will follow. Chicken and the egg. You follow my logic? Of course you do. You’re a bright, forward-thinking fella who knows a good idea when he hears it.
(BEAT)
So whaddaya say?


EXT. PARKING LOT - SHORT TIME LATER

Kroc lugs the sample Multimixer back to his car.
 
6.


INT. KROC’S CAR - SHORT TIME LATER

Kroc is pulled up to a customer spot in front of Joe’s Drive-In. The scene before him is very much like the one at Ed’s Drive-In, a riot of teenage rowdiness.

He looks at his watch. It’s 12:45. He HONKS, shouting out to no one in particular:

RAY KROC
Could someone tell me when my...

He trails off as a female CARHOP approaches with a tray. She hooks the tray onto his car door.

CARHOP
Enjoy.

She heads off. He lifts the cover off his plate, primed to dig in. His face falls at the sight of the hamburger beneath. He leans out the window, honks.

RAY KROC
I ordered the barbecued beef!

He’s howling into the void.


EXT. MERRIMAN’S DRIVE-IN - LATER

Another drive-in. Kroc with the OWNER.

RAY KROC
Mr. Merriman, are you familiar with the notion of the chicken and the--

OWNER
No, thank you.

The Owner disappears into the restaurant. Kroc, shut down, lugs the Multimixer over to his nearby car, heaves it into the trunk. He takes a swig from his FLASK.


EXT. MERRIMAN’S DRIVE-IN - MOMENTS LATER

Kroc at a pay phone, dialing a long-distance number.

JUNE MARTINO (O.S.)
Prince Castle, how may I help you?

RAY KROC
Hi, June.
 
7.


INT. PRINCE CASTLE SALES - CONTINUOUS

A modest office in a Chicago high-rise. At the reception desk is secretary JUNE MARTINO. (Intercut as necessary.)

JUNE MARTINO
Ray. How’s it going down there?

RAY KROC
Fine, swell, lot of interest.

JUNE MARTINO
That’s terrific. Hold on, I’ll

fetch your messages.

She grabs a pile of messages off the desk.

JUNE MARTINO (CONT’D) Let’s see: Gene Rafferty from United Aluminum, says he needs to reschedule Friday... Ed Nance calling again about the refund... a lady from March of Dimes about a donation... oh, and we got an order. Six.

RAY KROC
Six?

JUNE MARTINO
Some drive-in out in California.

RAY KROC
One place? That’s impossible.

JUNE MARTINO
I’ve got the slip right here.

RAY KROC
You must’ve misunderstood. Give me the number, I’ll straighten it out.


EXT. MERRIMAN’S DRIVE-IN - SHORT TIME LATER--

Kroc pours a few nickels into the pay phone, dials a number off his wrist.

YOUNG EMPLOYEE (O.S.)
Hello?

RAY KROC
Good afternoon. May I please speak to the owner?
 
8.


YOUNG EMPLOYEE (O.S.)
Which one?

RAY KROC
I’m sorry?

YOUNG EMPLOYEE (O.S.)
Dick or Mac?

RAY KROC
Um, whomever’s available.

The guy puts the phone down, heads off. Through the receiver, Kroc hears the sounds of an insanely busy--and efficient-- kitchen. “Order up!”... “I need six fries!”... “Patties up!”

DICK MCDONALD (O.S.)
This is Dick.

RAY KROC
Hello Dick, this is Ray Kroc from Prince Castle Sales. I’m phoning because someone there placed an order with us for some Multimixers.

DICK MCDONALD
Yes, yes, that was me. How soon can you get ‘em out here?

RAY KROC
Well, that’s actually why I was
calling. I believe there may have

been a miscommunication between--

In the background, someone SHOUTS SOMETHING to Dick.

DICK MCDONALD
Freezer! Top shelf, left side!
(back to Kroc)

Sorry.

RAY KROC
My secretary’s under the impression you wanted six.

DICK MCDONALD
You know what? I think that’s a

mistake.

RAY KROC
That’s what I figured. What kind of drive-in would be making 30 shakes at a--
 
9.


DICK MCDONALD
Better make it eight.

ON KROC-- flabbergasted. Another background SHOUT.

DICK MCDONALD (CONT’D)
What’s that, Al? There’s a brand-
new box in the storeroom!
(to Kroc)

Look, now isn’t the best time.

RAY KROC
I’m sorry, I’m still a bit--

DICK MCDONALD
You know where to send ‘em, right? San Bernardino, California. Corner of 14th and E.

RAY KROC
To anyone in particular?

DICK MCDONALD
Just the store is fine. McDonald’s.

Another BACKGROUND SHOUT distracts Dick.

DICK MCDONALD (CONT’D)
I gotta go. Just get those mixers

out here ASAP, okay? Thanks!

Click. Kroc stares at the receiver. What the hell was that?


EXT. MERRIMAN’S DRIVE-IN - MOMENTS LATER

Kroc stands over a U.S. ROAD MAP on the hood of his car. He unfolds it, opening the map westward. (Note: This part of the map is not well-worn like the Midwest; it’s virgin territory for Kroc.)

Kroc’s eyes drift westward to California. They land on a small town 60 miles east of Los Angeles: San Bernardino.

Kroc looks at the whole country. He notices something. A road directly connecting St. Louis to San Bernardino. Route 66.

ON KROC-- staring at Route 66. A single, unbroken line running from where he is now to that mysterious city out in Southern California.
 
10.


EXT. ROUTE 66 - DAY

Kroc driving west on Route 66. Cars, the open road, a limitless horizon. The sky, the country, the whole world seems to open up. His heart swells with possibility. The vastness excites his brain. This must be how Lewis & Clark felt. And then...


EXT. SAN BERNARDINO CITY LIMITS - ROUTE 66 - DAY

Kroc arrives in San Bernardino. A drab, dusty little town on the edge of the desert. Hardly the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow he was expecting. He continues along Route 66, heading toward the center of town.


SHORT TIME LATER--

Kroc driving. He sees the line before he sees the restaurant. A long line, hundreds of people, snaking toward a HAMBURGER STAND in the distance.

ON KROC-- taking in the strange sight of people out of their cars, queued up in a line leading toward a self-service window. It’s a distinctly FAMILY CROWD, lots of parents with their children. Not a teenage delinquent in sight.

He parks, gets out. Unsure what to do, he gets in the line.
He looks off at the restaurant, checks his watch. It’s 1:15.

WOMAN (O.S.)
Don’t worry. It moves fast.

ANGLE ON the WOMAN in front of him. No sooner does she say this than the line moves. Kroc shuffles forward 10 feet.

SHORT TIME LATER--

Kroc in line, significantly further along. He looks at his watch. It’s 1:19.


EXT. MCDONALD’S - SHORT TIME LATER

Kroc at the front of the line. He checks his watch. 1:23.

CASHIER (O.S.)
Welcome to McDonald’s, may I take

your order?
 
11.


Kroc looks up, sees a CASHIER looking at him with a friendly smile. Like all the other cashiers, he’s male and wholesome as apple pie.

RAY KROC
Um, yes...

He looks at the MENU BOARD. It has just FOUR ITEMS: burgers, fries, shakes, and Coca-Cola. A radical departure from the typical sprawling drive-in menu.

RAY KROC (CONT’D)
Hamburger, fries, and a Coca-Cola.

CASHIER
45 cents, please.

Kroc hands him two quarters.

CASHIER (CONT’D)
And five cents is your change.

Kroc barely has time to put the nickel away when--

CASHIER (CONT’D)
Here you are.

The cashier hands him a paper sack. Kroc looks at it with confusion.

RAY KROC
What’s this?

CASHIER
Your food.

RAY KROC
I just ordered.

CASHIER
(shrugs, smiles)

And now it’s here.

Kroc peers into the bag. Lo and behold, inside is a burger, fries, and a Coca-Cola. He sees it’s all wrapped in PAPER.

RAY KROC
(”Where are the”--)

Silverware? Plates?

CASHIER
You just eat it straight out of the wrapper. Then throw it all out.
 
12.


ON KROC-- bewildered. He takes the bag, unsure what to do.

RAY KROC
So now I bring it back to my car?

CASHIER
Most folks do. Or you could eat it in the park, at home... anywhere you like.

Kroc nods. This is all so strange to him. He turns, heads toward his car. On the way, he spots an EMPTY BENCH. He impulsively takes a seat.

Kroc reaches into the bag in his lap. He takes out the hamburger, noting the paper packaging. He unwraps the burger, looking at it, sniffing it. It looks and smells wonderful.

As he’s about to take a bite, out the corner of his eye he notices in a nearby car... a GORGEOUS BLONDE.

KROC’S POV: The blonde, biting into a hamburger. As she chews, a look of ecstasy comes over her face. She closes her eyes, her head tipping back a bit, borderline orgasmic.

ON KROC-- staring at the blonde.

MOTHER (O.S.)
May we?

Kroc is shaken out of his reverie by a FAMILY OF FOUR looking to sit on the bench. He slides over, making room.

MOTHER (CONT’D)
Thank you.

Kroc’s attention shifts from the blonde to the family. He discretely watches as the mother passes out burgers to her two young kids. The kids bite into them, “mmm”-ing audibly.

ON KROC-- observing this family of four, wholesome as can be, devouring their delicious McDonald’s hamburgers.

Kroc looks at the burger in his own hand, takes a bite. As he chews, his eyes roll back in his head.

MAN (O.S.)
How is everything?

Kroc looks up, sees a MAN standing before him. His necktie and demeanor suggest manager.

RAY KROC
This is the best burger I ever had.
 
13.


MAN
We aim to please.

The man smiles, extends a friendly hand.

MAN (CONT’D)
Mac McDonald.

RAY KROC
Ray Kroc.

They shake. Kroc pulls a BUSINESS CARD from a pocket, hands it to him. McDonald looks at it, unsure what to make of it:

RAY KROC - PRINCE CASTLE SALES CORP. - 2310 WACKER DRIVE, CHICAGO, ILL.

RAY KROC (CONT’D)
The Multimixer fella.

MAC MCDONALD
(it clicks in--)

You spoke to my brother.

Mac looks again at the card, noting the Chicago address.

MAC MCDONALD (CONT’D)
What brings you way out here?

RAY KROC
Oh, I was just in Los Angeles. Meetings. Business. Figured as long as I was in the neighborhood, I’d swing by, say hello.

MAC MCDONALD
Well, I’m glad you did. Welcome!

Kroc’s eyes drift to the busy, humming restaurant.

RAY KROC
Quite an operation you got here.

MAC MCDONALD
Care for a little tour?

There’s nothing Kroc would like more.


INT. KITCHEN - SHORT TIME LATER

A bustling kitchen, organized as a series of stations.
 
14.


MAC MCDONALD (O.S.)
Speed...

ON MAC-- leading Kroc through the kitchen.

MAC MCDONALD (CONT’D)
That’s the name of the game.

They come to a massive GRILL manned by THREE COOKS.

MAC MCDONALD (CONT’D)
First stop for every McDonald’s
hamburger is the grill, manned by
three cooks whose sole job is to
grill those all-beef beauties to

perfection.

Kroc watches the mouth-watering beef sizzling on the grill.

MAC MCDONALD (CONT’D)
Meanwhile...

He leads Kroc to an adjacent station, where two DRESSERS stand before a rotating Lazy Susan with 24 BUN TOPS on it.

MAC MCDONALD (CONT’D) As the patty cooks, our “dressers” get the bun ready.

DRESSER #1 puts pickle slices and onion on each bun--

MAC MCDONALD (CONT’D) Every McDonald’s hamburger gets two pickles, a pinch of onion...

--while DRESSER #2 applies a squirt of ketchup and mustard with a pair of trigger-operated CONDIMENT GUNS.

MAC MCDONALD (CONT’D)
...and a precise shot of ketchup

and mustard.

RAY KROC
(re: condiment guns)

Where’d you get those things?

MAC MCDONALD
We made ‘em.

RAY KROC
Made them?

MAC MCDONALD
Custom built. Whole kitchen is.
 
15.


ON KROC-- utterly amazed.

MAC MCDONALD (CONT’D)
(resuming tour)
Next it’s off to the finishing

station...

ANGLE ON the Lazy Susan, carrying 24 fully dressed bun tops, traveling along a belt toward a FINISHING STATION.

MAC MCDONALD (CONT’D)
Where it all comes together.

A pair of FINISHERS put cooked patties onto the fully dressed bun tops, then put on bun bottoms and neatly wrap it up.

MAC MCDONALD (CONT’D)
Voilá!

The finished product is fed into an angled metal sleeve that slides them to the front counter, where cashiers can grab and bag them with ease.

MAC MCDONALD (CONT’D)
A fresh and delicious hamburger,

grill to counter in 30 seconds.

ON KROC-- dumbfounded by what he’s seen. He looks at Mac.

RAY KROC
How?

MAC MCDONALD
Did I come up with all of this?
(sly smile)

I	didn’t.

Kroc is confused.

MAC MCDONALD (CONT’D)
We did.

Kroc follows Mac’s eyes to a MAN coming toward them.

MAC MCDONALD (CONT’D)
Dick McDonald. My brother.

Kroc grabs Dick’s hand, enthusiastically shakes.

RAY KROC
I just have to say, what you’ve

done here is nothing short of--
 
16.


DICK MCDONALD
(to Mac, ignoring Ray)

The fries.

MAC MCDONALD
What about ‘em?

Dick leads Mac toward the FRENCH FRY STATION. Kroc follows along. Dick plucks a fry off the drying rack, hands it to Mac, who pops it in his mouth.

MAC MCDONALD (CONT’D)
Perfect.

DICK MCDONALD
They’re five percent too crisp.

Dick takes a fry, tastes it. Frowns.

DICK MCDONALD (CONT’D)
I think we should drop to two

minutes, 50 seconds.

MAC MCDONALD
That’s what you had it at before.

DICK MCDONALD
400, not 375. Higher temp, shorter cook.

Mac takes another taste.

MAC MCDONALD
I really think they’re spot-on.

RAY KROC
(to Dick)

If it makes any difference, they’re the best fries I’ve ever tasted. Crispy golden brown on the outside, fluffy on the inside. Not too oily, perfectly salty and crunchy.

Dick looks at Ray, taking note of him for the first time.

DICK MCDONALD
Who are you?

MAC MCDONALD
This is that Multimixer fella you

spoke to.

RAY KROC
Ray Kroc, Prince Castle Sales.
 
17.


Kroc hands Dick his card. Dick gives it a cursory glance.

DICK MCDONALD
How soon you figure we can expect

‘em?

RAY KROC
I’m sending them Blue Label Air.

You should have it early next week.

DICK MCDONALD
Good.

With this, Dick abruptly walks off. Ray gives chase.

RAY KROC
Wait!

He catches up, grabs Dick’s arm.

RAY KROC (CONT’D)
Let me take you out to dinner.

DICK MCDONALD
(jokey)

You’re really not my type.

RAY KROC
You and your brother.

Mac, a few feet away, comes over, curious.

MAC MCDONALD
What for?

RAY KROC
I’m gonna shoot straight with you fellas. This restaurant is the most remarkable thing I’ve seen in all my years in the food-service industry. And believe you me, I’ve seen it all. I want to know everything about it. Where it came from, how you thought of it.
(BEAT)

Please. Tell me your story.


INT. STEAKHOUSE - EVENING

Kroc sits across from the brothers in a corner booth, rib eye steaks in front of all three.
 
18.


MAC MCDONALD
There wasn’t a job in all of
Manchester. All of New Hampshire.
So we packed our bags and headed
west. To Hollywood. I wanted to be
in the movie business. And Dick,
well, he wanted to be...

DICK MCDONALD
Employed.

MAC MCDONALD
We landed jobs driving trucks for Columbia Pictures. After a few years, we had enough saved up to buy our own little piece of show business. A little movie theater out in Glendora. Which would’ve been swell, except for the small matter of timing. It was September of ‘29. One minute we’re screening “Gold Diggers Of Broadway”, the next it’s “Brother, can you spare a dime?” Literally.

DICK MCDONALD
I couldn’t.

MAC MCDONALD
Nobody in town was making any
money. Except this one fella, Wylie
Reid. Ran a hot dog and root beer
stand. People still gotta eat,
right? So we decide to set up our
own stand, hot dogs and orange
juice, out in Arcadia.


EXT. ARCADIA - DAY (FLASHBACK)

A YOUNG DICK AND MAC manning their dusty, roadside HOT DOG STAND during the Great Depression. A smattering of CUSTOMERS.

MAC MCDONALD (V.O.)
It did okay, enough to keep us off the bread line, but we were hardly doing gangbusters. There just weren’t enough people in Arcadia.
 
19.


BACK TO PRESENT--

MAC MCDONALD
Meanwhile, one town over is San
Bernardino, the place is growing at
a terrific clip. We want to
relocate, but we’ve got no money
for a new stand. That’s when my
brother here gets one of his
brilliant ideas. Tell him, Dick.

Dick throws Mac a “That’s okay, you tell him” nod.

MAC MCDONALD (CONT’D) “Why don’t we move the stand we’ve got? Put it on a truck!”
(BEAT)
Genius, right? Except one small problem. On the road between the towns, there’s an overpass. The building doesn’t clear. I figure that’s it, we’re done for. But then Dick says...

Another nod of deferral from Dick.

MAC MCDONALD (CONT’D) “Why don’t we saw the restaurant in half?”


EXT. ROAD - DAY (FLASHBACK)

Dick and Mac driving an old flatbed Ford. On the back is the stand, SPLIT IN TWO. The truck goes under an overpass, narrowly clearing.

MAC MCDONALD (V.O.)
We truck the darn thing over in two pieces, put it back together!


BACK TO PRESENT--

Kroc guffaws with amazement.

MAC MCDONALD
We move the building, set up shop. But before we open, we decide to give the place a little tweak. It’s 1940. Drive-ins are all the rage, the hottest thing going. I say Dick, we gotta get in on this. Dick says sure.

(MORE)
 
20.

MAC MCDONALD (CONT'D)
Two months later, we open for
business...
(show-biz hands)

“McDonald’s Famous Barbecue!”


EXT. MCDONALD’S FAMOUS BARBECUE - DAY (FLASHBACK)

The brothers’ proto-McDonald’s, up and running. Pretty CARHOPS in tasseled short skirts and Western boots hustle about serving customers.

MAC MCDONALD (V.O.) We’ve got a 27-item menu, barbecue slow-cooked in a real pit out back. Uniformed waitresses bring the food straight out to your car. It does gangbusters. Going great guns. But then, sales start to level off.


BACK TO PRESENT--

DICK MCDONALD
The drive-in model, as we learn,

has a few built-in problems.

Kroc leans in, eager to hear their take on this.

DICK MCDONALD (CONT’D) For starters, there’s the customer issue. Drive-ins tend to attract, shall we say, a less-than desirable clientele.

MAC MCDONALD
Teenagers.

DICK MCDONALD
Hot rodders and hooligans. Juvenile delinquents in blue jeans.

Kroc nods, all too familiar.

DICK MCDONALD (CONT’D) Then there’s the service. It takes forever and a day for your food to arrive. And when it finally does--

RAY KROC
It’s completely wrong.
 
21.


DICK MCDONALD
The carhops are too busy dodging
gropes to remember you wanted a

strawberry phosphate, not cherry.

RAY KROC
If they remember at all.

MAC MCDONALD
Then there’s the expenses. Payroll is high due to the large staff required. Dishes are constantly getting stolen or broken.

DICK MCDONALD
Tremendous overhead.

MAC MCDONALD
But one day Dick has a realization. Going over the books, he notices something. The bulk of our sales come from just three items: Burgers, fries, soft drinks.

DICK MCDONALD
87 percent.

MAC MCDONALD
We say to ourselves, what the heck are we doing monkeying around with all this other stuff? Focus on what sells.

Kroc nods. Yes.

MAC MCDONALD (CONT’D) And that’s just what we do. Brisket, gone. Tamales, gone. And we don’t stop at the menu. We look at everything. What else don’t we need?

DICK MCDONALD
Turns out, quite a lot.

MAC MCDONALD
Carhops.

DICK MCDONALD
Walk up to a window. Get your food yourself.

MAC MCDONALD
Dishes.
 
22.


DICK MCDONALD
All paper packaging. Disposable.

MAC MCDONALD
Jukeboxes, cigarette machines.

DICK MCDONALD
Drive out the riff-raff.

RAY KROC
(totally in sync)
Create a family-friendly

environment!

MAC MCDONALD
And finally, the biggest, most

important cut of all... the wait.

DICK MCDONALD
Orders ready in 30 seconds, not 30 minutes.

MAC MCDONALD
We decide to tear down the kitchen. Rebuild. Reconfigure. Rethink the whole dang thing. And you’re gonna love how we do it. Tell him, Dick.

DICK MCDONALD
The tennis court?

MAC MCDONALD
He brings me out to this tennis
court, draws an outline in the
dirt. Exact dimensions of our

kitchen.


EXT. TENNIS COURT - DAY (FLASHBACK)

A TENNIS COURT, somewhere in San Bernardino. Mac watches as Dick carefully draws a KITCHEN OUTLINE on it with a stick.

MAC MCDONALD (V.O.)
We bring in a bunch of employees,
have ‘em go through the motions,

making pretend burgers and fries.

--An invisible kitchen, YOUNG EMPLOYEES mimicking the moves, trying to get it right.
 
23.


MAC MCDONALD (V.O.) Dick’s chasing after them with the stick, marking up where all the equipment should go. They do it over and over, hashing out the moves, choreographing like it’s some sort of crazy burger ballet.

--Over and over. It’s starting to get dark.

DICK MCDONALD (V.O.)
Finally, after about six hours of

this, we get it just right.

--Workers making pretend burgers and fries in perfect sync.

DICK MCDONALD (V.O.)
A symphony of efficiency. Not a

wasted motion.


BACK TO PRESENT--

DICK MCDONALD
We take the layout to a builder,

custom build to exact specs.

MAC MCDONALD
Ta-da. The Speedee System is born.
The world’s first-ever system
designed to deliver food fast. It’s

totally revolutionary.

DICK MCDONALD
And a complete disaster.


EXT. MCDONALD’S - DAY (FLASHBACK)

The grand opening. The hungry and the curious pulling up.

MAC MCDONALD (V.O.) Opening day, people pull into the lot, immediately start honking when no carhop comes over. We try to explain the walk-up window. They’re bewildered. Furious. “Whaddaya mean I gotta get out of my car?”
 
24.


BACK TO PRESENT--

MAC MCDONALD
Most of them just cuss us out and drive off. The few that stick around are mad as heck about having to eat off paper and discard their own trash.

DICK MCDONALD
We may have underestimated the

learning curve.

MAC MCDONALD
By five o’clock, Dick’s calculating the cost of converting back to drive-in. But me, I’m not quite ready to throw in the towel. Going back to my Hollywood roots, I say to myself, “We gotta go big with this. We gotta put on a show.” I tell Dick I want to throw a grand re-opening. A gala premiere to put Louis B. Mayer to shame.


EXT. GRAND RE-OPENING - EVENING (FLASHBACK)

The fast-food equivalent of a Hollywood-style premiere.

MAC MCDONALD (V.O.)
We rent a bunch of spotlights, the same ones we used to truck around to premieres in the Columbia days. I get sparklers, a juggler for the kiddies--it’s an event. People show up in droves. And then...

DICK MCDONALD (V.O.)
The flies.

--An ominous cloud gathers over the restaurant. A SWARM OF INSECTS. They swoop down in unison, as if in attack mode.

DICK MCDONALD (V.O.) They must’ve been drawn by all the lights.

MAC MCDONALD (V.O.)
Millions of ‘em. Looked like

something out of Exodus.

--Customers running, screaming. Swatting.
 
25.


DICK MCDONALD (V.O.)
The Pharaoh would’ve released the

Israelites.


BACK TO PRESENT--

MAC MCDONALD
It’s a total disaster. Towel time.
(BEAT)

The next morning, Dick and I meet up to discuss going back to the old format. As we’re talking, there’s a knock at the service window. Dick goes over, sees a little boy standing there. He wants a bag of burgers.


INT. MCDONALD’S - DAY (FLASHBACK)

Dick at the service window, looking at a YOUNG KID. His nose barely clears the counter.

DICK MCDONALD (V.O.)
I tell him we’re closed.

MAC MCDONALD (V.O.)
But he’s cute, I feel bad for him, so I fire up the grill, make him a batch. And as he’s heading off...

--A car pulls into the lot.

MAC MCDONALD (V.O.)
A car pulls up.

--A second car.

MAC MCDONALD (V.O.)
Then another.

--A third car.

MAC MCDONALD (V.O.)
And another. Before you know it,

there’s a line around the block.

--A LINE OF CUSTOMERS stretching into the distance.

MAC MCDONALD (V.O.)
Word has spread.
 
26.


BACK TO PRESENT--

DICK MCDONALD
And it’s off to the races.

MAC MCDONALD
We’re an overnight sensation.

Thirty years in the making.

ON KROC-- absorbing all of this, blown away.

Mac gives Kroc a modest little shrug.

MAC MCDONALD (CONT’D)
So that’s our story.


INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Kroc lies awake in bed, buzzing, unable to sleep.


EXT. MCDONALD’S - NEXT MORNING

Dick and Mac pull into the McDonald’s lot in Dick’s car. They’re startled to see--

Kroc, sitting out front. He approaches their car. Before Dick can fully roll down his window:

RAY KROC
Franchise.

DICK MCDONALD
Beg pardon?

RAY KROC
Franchise, franchise the thing.
It’s too good to just be one
location. There ought to be
McDonald’s everywhere. Coast to
coast, sea to shining sea. And I’m
just the man to help you do it.
I’ve spent the better part of my
life criss-crossing this country. I
know every highway and byway, every

city and every town.

DICK MCDONALD
Mr. Kroc...

RAY KROC
Let me just say one thing. One more thing.

(MORE)
 
27.

RAY KROC (CONT'D)
I want to confess something to you boys. I’m not out here in California on any business meeting. I’m out here for you. You’re what brought me out. A few days ago, I was standing outside a filling station in St. Louis, Missouri staring at a U.S. road map, staring at a long, white, unbroken line called Route 66. I took my finger--

DICK MCDONALD
Mr. Kroc--

RAY KROC
I took my finger, and I traced that line from where I was standing all the way out to California, where it ran smack-dab into this place we are now. As I stared at that line, something told me to follow it. Something told me to get in my car and see what’s out there at the other end. And when I laid eyes on your hamburger stand yesterday, all those people lined up to purchase your remarkable product, I knew it was--

DICK MCDONALD
We already tried!


INT. MCDONALD’S - BACK OFFICE - SHORT TIME LATER

Kroc and the brothers stand before a U.S. MAP.

DICK MCDONALD
Five.

ANGLE ON map. Five PUSH PINS are stuck in it, clustered around California and the Southwest.

DICK MCDONALD (CONT’D)
Three in Southern California, one
in Sacramento and one in Phoenix.
(BEAT)

And that’s all there’ll ever be.

RAY KROC
Why?
 
28.


DICK MCDONALD
Two words: Quality control. It’s
almost impossible to enforce

standards from afar.

MAC MCDONALD
Those places were a mess. Filthy

kitchens, inconsistent menus...

DICK MCDONALD
Sacramento was selling burritos.

MAC MCDONALD
To watch your precious creation get mismanaged like that. Your name.

DICK MCDONALD
Put Mac in the hospital.

Kroc looks at Mac, surprised.

MAC MCDONALD
Diabetes and extreme stress don’t

mix.

A BEAT as Kroc absorbs this.

RAY KROC
But if you had somebody in charge

of supervising.

MAC MCDONALD
We did.

RAY KROC
What happened?

DICK MCDONALD
He obviously didn’t do a great job.

RAY KROC
So replace him. With someone

better.

DICK MCDONALD
Our energies are better spent
making this place the best it can

possibly be.

MAC MCDONALD
Better one great restaurant than 50 mediocre ones.
 
29.


RAY KROC
Sure, but I still think if you had the right--

DICK MCDONALD
Thank you, we’re not interested.

RAY KROC
Someone as committed to quality as--

DICK MCDONALD
Thank you.

Kroc backs off. A BEAT of awkward silence.

Kroc’s eye goes to something else on the wall... a BLUEPRINT.
The building has towering arches on each side.

RAY KROC
What’s that?

DICK MCDONALD
A blueprint.

RAY KROC
Those:

Mac follows Kroc’s eyes to the arches.

MAC MCDONALD
It’s a way to make the place stand out when you’re driving past.

DICK MCDONALD
“The Golden Arches” I call ‘em.

Kroc stares at them, fascinated. It’s a crazy, radical (and kind of brilliant) thing to stick on the sides of a building.

RAY KROC
Who thought of that?

MAC MCDONALD
That’s pure Dick magic right there.

Dick’s gaze is still on the arches, clearly proud.

RAY KROC
Ever do one like that?

DICK MCDONALD
Just one...
 
30.


Dick looks at the U.S. map. A lonely push pin in the middle of Arizona.

DICK MCDONALD (CONT’D)
Phoenix.


EXT. ROUTE 66 - SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA/ARIZONA - DAY

Kroc driving back along Route 66, taking in the scenery.

SERIES OF SHOTS: Kroc passing through various small towns, each with a Main Street running through it. On every Main Street, we see the same two things: a church and courthouse.

Glimpses of various churches and courthouses. Churches topped with crosses. Courthouses with American flags.

ON KROC-- processing, wheels turning.


EXT. ROUTE 66 - FLAGSTAFF, AZ - NIGHT

Kroc driving through Flagstaff. He passes a road sign: I-17 SOUTH - PHOENIX - NEXT RIGHT

He takes an impulsive detour.


EXT. CENTRAL AVENUE (PHOENIX) - SHORT TIME LATER

Kroc drives down Phoenix’s Central Avenue. He sees the arches before he sees the restaurant.

Kroc pulls into the empty lot (the restaurant is closed). He gets out, looks up at the arches. They’re lit up and glowing. Glorious, magical.

He does a slow lap around the building, taking in the arches from all angles. Halfway around, the shifting perspective causes the arches to meet. They form a giant “M” (the McDonald’s logo as we know it today), 30 feet high.

ON KROC-- standing before the “M”, bathed in its golden, glowing light. Like Moses before the Burning Bush.

EXT. KROC’S HOUSE (DES PLAINES, IL) - DAY

A modest home in the Chicago suburbs. Kroc pulls up in his car.
 
31.


INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

ETHEL (53) is at the table, eating dinner by herself.

RAY KROC (O.S.)
Ethel!

Kroc comes bursting in, burning with excitement.

RAY KROC (CONT’D)
I’ve seen the future!

Ethel’s face falls.

ETHEL KROC
Again?

RAY KROC
I saw a restaurant, Ethel. It’s
like nothing you’ve ever seen.
They’ve got this system, the

Speedee System...

ETHEL KROC
Ray...

RAY KROC
Just hear me out.

ETHEL KROC
I’m too old for this.

RAY KROC
This place, it’s like something

sprung from the mind of Henry--

ETHEL KROC
I can’t do it. Not again.

RAY KROC
Don’t you want to be a part of

greatness?

ETHEL KROC
I want to be part of a cruise.
(BEAT)

All our friends are taking trips, enjoying their golden years. And us, we’re still scrapping and scraping like a couple of 25-year-olds. When do we get to start living, Ray? When do we finally get to start enjoying our lives?
 
32.


RAY KROC
Ethel, this place--

ETHEL KROC
It’s revolutionary.

RAY KROC
(bristles at her sarcasm)

As a matter of fact...

ETHEL KROC
It’s never going to get any better, Ray. We’re never going to have anything more than we have right now. And that’s okay.
(BEAT)
What’s not okay is us wasting our lives reaching for some brass ring we’re never going to grab.

RAY KROC
(flash of anger)
Maybe if I had a wife who had an
ounce of vision. Who gave me an

ounce of support.

ETHEL KROC
Support? Support?

This sets her off--

ETHEL KROC (CONT’D)
All I’ve done is support you! I’ve had your back through thick and thin, through one cockamamie idea after another. The wax cups, the Fold-A-Nook, the Multi-Mixer, on and on, every last one. And you have the nerve to say I don’t support you?

RAY KROC
(backing off, chastened)

I’m sorry.

ETHEL KROC
I’ve believed in you, Ray. Our whole marriage. Long past the point any rational, thinking person would’ve.

RAY KROC
You’re right.
 
33.


ETHEL KROC
I’ve sacrificed, I’ve saved. Made
do, gone without. My belt’s so

tight, I’m out of notches.

RAY KROC
You’re right.

ETHEL KROC
“Support”?
(BEAT)

How dare you?

Kroc just stands there in shamed little-boy silence.


EXT. MOVIE THEATER - SHORT TIME LATER

Kroc steps to the ticket window.

RAY KROC
One ticket, please.

The marquees reads MAGNIFICENT OBSESSION.


INT. MOVIE THEATER - SHORT TIME LATER

Kroc sits in the theater, the light of the screen flickering off his face. In his hand is his flask. He takes a discrete swig.


INT. PRINCE CASTLE SALES - KROC’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

June Martino watches Kroc pace, ringing phone to his ear.

EMPLOYEE (O.S.)
McDonald’s Hamburgers.

RAY KROC
Dick McDonald, please.

EMPLOYEE (O.S.)
He’s not available at the moment.

RAY KROC
Mac, then.

The employee puts the phone down, goes off to check. Through it, Kroc hears what sounds like a BIG CROWD.
 
34.


EMPLOYEE (O.S.)
I’m sorry, he’ll have to call you

back. We’re real busy right now.

Kroc glances at his watch, puzzled by the commotion.

RAY KROC
What time is it there?

EMPLOYEE (O.S.)
10 o’clock.

RAY KROC
(thrown)

What time do you open?

EMPLOYEE (O.S.)
11.

ON KROC-- amazed. They don’t even open for another hour.


INT. JOHNSON’S DRIVE-IN - KITCHEN - SHORT TIME LATER

Kroc out on a drive-in sales call, giving his standard spiel.

RAY KROC
(flat, distracted)

Mr. Johnson, are you familiar with the notion of the chicken and the egg? I mention it because I think it’s applicable here.


EXT. JOHNSON’S DRIVE-IN - PARKING LOT - SHORT TIME LATER

Kroc hauls the sample Multimixer back to his car, shoves it in the trunk. He takes a swig from his flask, staring off.

INT. MIDWAY AIRPORT - SHORT TIME LATER

Kroc steps to the TWA ticket counter.

RAY KROC
One ticket to Los Angeles.


INT. MCDONALD’S - KITCHEN - EVENING

The dinner rush. Mac and Dick hustle about making sure things run as smoothly as possible.

ON DICK-- reloading the Lazy Susan with bun tops.
 
35.


RAY KROC (O.S.)
Do it for your country.

DICK MCDONALD
(turns, surprised)

Ray.

MAC MCDONALD (O.S.)
What are you doing here?

Mac is there, too.

RAY KROC
If you boys don’t want to franchise for yourselves, fine. But do it for your country. For America.
(BEAT)
This place you’ve created, it’s not a restaurant. It’s not even a place. It’s an idea.

ON DICK-- absorbing.

DICK MCDONALD
(to nearby employee)

Tommy, finish the buns.


INT. BACK OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

Kroc stands before the brothers.

RAY KROC
That drive back home on 66, I passed through a lot of towns. A lot of small towns. In the middle of each one of them was a Main Street. And on each of those Main Streets were always the same two things: a courthouse and a church. A courthouse topped with a flag. A church topped with a cross. Flags and crosses, crosses and flags.

The brothers look at each other, unsure where this is going.

RAY KROC (CONT’D)
As I drove along, I pondered those crosses and flags. I asked myself why they’re so ubiquitous. What they mean. And as I did, I couldn’t help but think about your restaurant. About these--
 
36.


He goes over to the blueprint, plants a finger on the arches.

RAY KROC (CONT’D)
Now, forgive me if this flirts with blasphemy, but to my mind, these arches share a great deal in common with the Christian cross and the American flag. A building topped with a cross is a gathering place. A place where decent, wholesome folks can come together and be with others who share their values. The same can be said of a building flanked by a pair of your arches. Those arches mean more than simply “delicious hamburgers inside”. They signify family. Community. The ties that bind. They represent goodness, togetherness, a place for Americans to gather and break bread. McDonald’s can be that, too. The new American church, feeding bodies and feeding souls. And not just on Sundays. Seven days a week.
