Crosses. Flags. Arches.

ON MAC-- blown away. He looks over at Dick, expecting a similar reaction. He’s surprised to see a conflicted look on his face.

MAC MCDONALD
(to Kroc)

Would you please give us a minute?


INT. BACK OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

The brothers, alone in the office.

DICK MCDONALD
(tempted, torn)

I don’t know...

MAC MCDONALD
It’s your dream, Dick.
(eye contact)
Bigger than your dream. Arches--

your arches--coast to coast.

Dick’s eyes go to the U.S. map. A whole country, just waiting to be filled in with push pins.
 
37.


DICK MCDONALD
I can’t put you through that again.

ON MAC-- looking at Dick gazing longingly at the map.

MAC MCDONALD
I know how bad you want this. You

should have it.

DICK MCDONALD
Last time, you very nearly wound

up——

MAC MCDONALD
We’ll do it different this time.

Learn from our mistakes.

DICK MCDONALD
How so?

MAC MCDONALD
We keep a much tighter leash. Total oversight, every change has to go through us.

DICK MCDONALD
Who says he’s gonna listen?

MAC MCDONALD
We draw up a contract. Lay it out, clear as day in black and white.

ON DICK-- pondering. Seemingly warming to the idea.

MAC MCDONALD (CONT’D)
Whaddaya say?


INT. LAW FIRM - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

Ray Kroc sits across a table from the brothers and their LAWYER. Kroc is skimming through a BIG FAT CONTRACT. Full of clauses and sections and paragraphs.

ANGLE ON contract. Amidst a wall of legalese:

...ANY AND ALL MODIFICATIONS TO THE SPEEDEE SYSTEM OR ANY MCDONALD FRANCHISE, EITHER PHYSICAL OR CONCEPTUAL, MUST BE FORMALLY SUBMITTED IN WRITING FOR APPROVAL BY BOTH RICHARD MCDONALD AND MAURICE MCDONALD...

RAY KROC (O.S.)
Fine.
 
38.


Kroc has a rushed air about him, eager to get to the dotted line. He continues skimming. A glimpse of another page:

...KROC SHALL RECEIVE ONE AND NINE-TENTHS PERCENT (1.9%) OF NET PROFITS GENERATED BY FRANCHISEE(S), WITH ONE-HALF OF ONE PERCENT (0.5%) OF SAID NET PROFITS PAID TO RICHARD MCDONALD AND MAURICE MCDONALD...

RAY KROC (O.S.) (CONT’D)
Fine.


SHORT TIME LATER--

Three copies of the contract are laid out before Kroc, open to the last page. The brothers’ lawyer slides him a fountain pen. He readily signs in triplicate.

RAY KROC (PRE-LAP)
We are a dynamic, fast-growing

company.


INT. MIDWAY SAVINGS & LOAN - DAY (ONE MONTH LATER)

Kroc, dressed in his best suit and tie, sits across from a LOAN OFFICER.

RAY KROC
And now, we’re poised to make major inroads nationally.

The loan officer looks at a set of BLUEPRINTS on his desk titled MCDONALD’S #6 - DES PLAINES, ILL.

RAY KROC (CONT’D)
In addition to giving us a foothold in the Midwest, the Des Plaines location will serve as a lure for prospective franchisees.

The loan officer looks over the blueprint. Something catches his eye.

LOAN OFFICER
What are those?

Kroc follows his gaze to the arches. He smiles proudly.

RAY KROC
Oh, that’s just my little way of
separating us from the pack. “The

Golden Arches”, I call ‘em.
 
39.


The loan officer picks up a bound prospectus prepared by Kroc. Artist renderings, projected earnings, etc.

ON KROC-- anxiously watching as he leafs through it.

RAY KROC (CONT’D)
(filling the air)
There’s nothing like it in the

entire food-service sector.

The loan officer looks up from the materials.

LOAN OFFICER
You look familiar. Have we met?

RAY KROC
(a drop uneasy)

I don’t believe so.

ON LOAN OFFICER, staring, determined to place the face. He snaps his fingers--

LOAN OFFICER
The Fold-A-Nook!
(hint of smirk)
“It’s Like A Murphy Bed... For Your

Kitchen!”


EXT. MIDWAY SAVINGS & LOAN - MOMENTS LATER

Kroc exits the bank in defeat.


INT. ILLINOIS FIRST FEDERAL - LATER

Kroc sits across from another LOAN OFFICER, watching as he looks over the prospectus.

RAY KROC
There’s nothing like it in the

entire food-service sector.

The officer looks up at Kroc.

LOAN OFFICER #2
Have we met?

The man searches his face. Kroc squirms.

LOAN OFFICER #2 (CONT’D)
The paper-cup guy.

ON KROC-- silent a long beat.
 
40.


RAY KROC
(embarrassed, broken)

Among many other things.

The loan officer stares at Kroc, taking in his vulnerable, Willy Loman-esque visage. A wave of compassion/pity comes over him.

LOAN OFFICER #2
I tell you what. Let me refer you
to one of my colleagues. Somebody
who may be better suited to meet

your needs.


A FEW DESKS DOWN - MOMENTS LATER

Kroc sits before a different LOAN OFFICER. The man is filling out an APPLICATION FORM for Kroc.

LOAN OFFICER
Address?

RAY KROC
143 Juniper Road, Arlington

Heights, Illinois.

ANGLE ON the form as the man fills in Kroc’s address. It’s a HOME-MORTGAGE LOAN APPLICATION. A desk plaque tells us this is HARVEY PELTZ - HOME MORTGAGE REPRESENTATIVE.

HARVEY PELTZ
Home telephone number?

RAY KROC
Let me give you my office number.

Kroc glances at his WEDDING RING.

RAY KROC (CONT’D)
That’s the best place to reach me.


INT. KROC’S OFFICE - DAY

ANGLE ON blueprints for the Des Plaines McDonald’s covering Kroc’s walls.

RAY KROC (O.S.)
Did you schedule the stakeout with the engineer?

JUNE MARTINO (O.S.)
All set.
 
41.


ON KROC-- at his desk, plowing through a lengthy to-do list as June takes notes.

RAY KROC
Where are we at on fire department approval for driveway design?

JUNE MARTINO
Left a message yesterday.

RAY KROC
Call again. Excavation permit?

JUNE MARTINO
Meeting with them today.

RAY KROC
Insurers?

JUNE MARTINO
I left a message yesterday.

RAY KROC
Call again. What about the zoning

office?

JUNE MARTINO
All set. On file with the city.

RAY KROC
San Bernardino?

JUNE MARTINO
I just spoke to Dick. He says

they’re working on it.

RAY KROC
Working on it?

He lets out a heaving, irritated sigh.

RAY KROC (CONT’D)
It’s been a week.


INT. MCDONALD’S (SAN BERNARDINO) - OFFICE - SHORT TIME LATER

Dick is at his desk. An EMPLOYEE sticks his head in.

EMPLOYEE
Ray Kroc, line one.

DICK MCDONALD
Hiya, Ray.
 
42.


RAY KROC (O.S.)
You boys are killing me.


INT. KROC’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

(Intercut as necessary.)

RAY KROC
What’s the hold up? I break ground in two weeks.

DICK MCDONALD
These things take time. You’re

proposing substantial alterations.

RAY KROC
I’m adding a basement and furnace.

DICK MCDONALD
We need our architect to thoroughly review it to make sure everything’s safe and up to code.

RAY KROC
Has he looked at it yet?

DICK MCDONALD
I’m not sure, to be honest.

RAY KROC
I can’t afford to let this drag.

DICK MCDONALD
Ray, you need to take a breath. It hasn’t even been a week.

RAY KROC
I’ve got bulldozers rolling up on

the 23rd.

DICK MCDONALD
I’m not the one who scheduled that.

RAY KROC
Do you have any idea what it’d cost me to push?

DICK MCDONALD
Hopefully, it won’t come to that.
 
43.


RAY KROC
Every restaurant in the Midwest has a basement and a furnace. This is standard stuff.

DICK MCDONALD
I understand. But you have to understand, it’s our name on that building. God forbid the floor caves in and people get hurt or worse because of some design flaw we missed, we’re the ones on the hook. So let’s just slow down a minute and make sure it’s done the right way. Alright?

ON KROC-- pondering Dick’s words of reason.

RAY KROC
So much for the Speedee System!

He hangs up.


SHORT TIME LATER--

Mac is in the office with Dick.

MAC MCDONALD
Then what did he say?

DICK MCDONALD
He slammed down the phone.

MAC MCDONALD
He hung up on you?

DICK MCDONALD
Unless we got violently

disconnected.

Dick looks off, feeling the first pangs of buyer’s remorse.

MAC MCDONALD
It’ll be fine.


EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - ANOTHER DAY

ANGLE ON a sign: COMING SOON - MCDONALD’S FAMOUS HAMBURGERS!

A hard-hatted Kroc stands in a dirt lot, watching SURVEYORS outline a building foundation. He heads over to one of the surveyors, pointing to some detail--
 
44.


RAY KROC
Can we bring that out another foot?

JUNE MARTINO (O.S.)
Sir?

June comes over to Kroc with a letter. He looks at it, sees the San Bernardino return address.

RAY KROC
Read it.

She opens the letter, reads aloud--

JUNE MARTINO
“Dear Ray, Thank you for your letter sharing your idea to strike a deal with Coca-Cola to sponsor menu boards at the new Des Plaines location. An intriguing notion, indeed. As you rightly point out, such an arrangement would provide a steady source of revenue to the store at no additional labor cost.

ON KROC-- pleased with the letter so far.

JUNE MARTINO (CONT’D)
“However...


INT. PAY PHONE - SHORT TIME LATER

Kroc is on a pay phone across the street from the construction site.

RAY KROC
Small, along the bottom. Very

discrete.


INT. MCDONALD’S - SAN BERNARDINO - CONTINUOUS

On the other end is Mac in the kitchen, his brother nearby. (Intercut as necessary.)

DICK MCDONALD
I’m sorry, Ray, but we’re just not comfortable with the notion of turning our menu into an advertisement.

RAY KROC
Not an ad. Sponsorship.
 
45.


DICK MCDONALD
It’s distasteful.

RAY KROC
It’s free money.

DICK MCDONALD
There are plenty of things we could do to make a quick buck, but that doesn’t mean we should.

RAY KROC
Loads of restaurants do it.

DICK MCDONALD
Well, we don’t.

RAY KROC
Why not?

DICK MCDONALD
Because I have no interest in
indulging in that sort of crass

commercialism. It’s not McDonald’s.

RAY KROC
I didn’t realize I was partnering

up with a beatnik.

DICK MCDONALD
I happen to be a card-carrying

Republican.

RAY KROC
You coulda fooled me!

He slams down the phone. Again.


SHORT TIME LATER--

Mac and Dick, post-call.

MAC MCDONALD
He’s just a little... excitable.

DICK MCDONALD
A hothead like that, you don’t know what he’s capable of.

MAC MCDONALD
It’s all bluster, Dick. His bark is worse than his bite.
 
46.


DICK MCDONALD
(dark chuckle)
That’s what Neville Chamberlain

said.


INT. MCDONALD’S (DES PLAINES) - DAY (MONTHS LATER)

The brand-new Des Plaines McDonald’s, up and running.

TRACKING SHOT, high-energy, as Kroc moves through the KITCHEN barking out orders to his charges. It’s a bit militaristic in vibe, echoing Dick’s Hitler reference:

“Watch those fries!”... “Straighten that hat!”... “Buns to the left, pickles to the right!”... “Let’s go, boys!”

He passes an EMPLOYEE, catching him in a moment of repose--

RAY KROC
Grab a mop! If there’s time to

lean, there’s time to clean!

Tracking shot ends at the GRILL, manned by a trio of GRILLERS overseeing dozens of patties. Kroc moves down the line:

GRILLER #1, flipping a patty--

RAY KROC (CONT’D)
More wrist!

Kroc grabs the spatula, demonstrates proper form. He moves onto GRILLER #2, who’s lifting a patty off the grill--

RAY KROC (CONT’D)
It’s still pink!

Kroc puts the patty back onto the grill. He moves on to GRILLER #3--

RAY KROC (CONT’D)
What the heck are you--

Kroc trails off, realizing Griller #3 is doing NOTHING WRONG.

His patties are perfect, arranged in rows so precise they could have been lined up with a ruler.

ON KROC-- taking in the eager young buck, who looks maybe 21.

RAY KROC (CONT’D)
What’s your name?
 
47.


GRILLER #3
Fred Turner, sir.

RAY KROC
Fred Turner...
(small, approving nod)

Keep it up.

FRED TURNER
Yes, sir.

Kroc walks off. Turner is thrilled by the approval.


EXT. MCDONALD’S - NIGHT (AFTER HOURS)

Under the glow of the arches, Kroc scours the parking lot, fanatically cleaning. Picking up discarded cups, scraping gum off the underside of benches.


INT. KROC’S HOUSE - LATER

Ethel is asleep in bed. Kroc enters, home from another long day of work. He starts getting undressed.

As he unbuttons his shirt, he hears a sound. A tiny sniffle.
Ethel is awake, crying softly.

He goes over, sits on the bed next to her.

RAY KROC
I’m sorry.

ON KROC-- taking in her sad, lonely face.

RAY KROC (CONT’D)
I know I’ve neglected you.

He looks her in the eye.

RAY KROC (CONT’D)
Tomorrow night. Let’s have supper

at the club.

ETHEL KROC
(surprised, heartened)

Really?

RAY KROC
It’s been far too long.

He hands her a tissue. She blows her nose.
 
48.


INT. ROLLING GREEN COUNTRY CLUB - DINING ROOM - NEXT NIGHT

The dining room of a not especially upscale country club. Kroc leads Ethel to a big round table. At it are fellow CLUB MEMBERS, who warmly greet them.

JERRY CULLEN
By George, I think I’ve seen a

ghost!


SHORT TIME LATER--

The middle of the meal. Ray kibitzes with the men, Ethel engaged in a cross-conversation with the wives.

ON ETHEL AND THE WOMEN--

CLUB WIFE #1
I hear Acapulco is divine.

CLUB WIFE #2
Mildred Ballard was just there. She adored it.

Ethel nods along, not wanting to stick out.

CLUB WIFE #2 (CONT’D)
Where do you like, Ethel?

ETHEL KROC
Me?
(BEAT, scrambling)

Spain.

CLUB WIFE #3
Wonderful! How was it?

ETHEL KROC
(backtracks)
I mean, we’re thinking about it.

Planning to, in the fall.

Nods and smiles from the other women. The conversation moves on, bullet dodged.

BACK TO KROC AND THE MEN--

JERRY CULLEN
That’s the last time I try a sand

wedge in that bunker!

Hearty laughs from the others, loving the golf humor.
 
49.


JACK HORFORD
How’s your game, Ray?

RAY KROC
Lately? Non-existent.

The men laugh, missing the literalness of the statement.

JACK HORFORD
I’m no Ben Hogan myself.

ON KROC-- seeing an opening in the conversation.

RAY KROC
(cryptic smile)
But I did recently hit a hole-in-

one of a different sort.

The men glance at each other, intrigued.

RAY KROC (CONT’D)
Anyone interested in hearing about

an exciting investment opportunity?

Kroc sneaks a glance at Ethel. She’s staring at him, crestfallen. So this is why we’re at the club.

JACK HORFORD (O.S.)
(chuckle)

Here we go again...

ON HORFORD-- smiling at Kroc, a bit condescendingly.

JACK HORFORD (CONT’D)
What is it this time, Ray?

ON ETHEL-- taking in the way Horford looks at her husband. It irks her.

ETHEL KROC
Hear him out.

Ethel looks at Ray, looks back at Horford.

ETHEL KROC (CONT’D)
This is different.

ON KROC-- surprised and touched she has his back. He grabs her hand under the table, looks her reassuringly in the eye.

Yes, it is. It is different this time.
 
50.


SERIES OF SHOTS:

--Jerry Cullen signing franchise papers as Kroc looks on.

--Kroc and Jack Horford, in hardhats, presiding as ground is broken at a CONSTRUCTION SITE. Behind them is a sign with McDonald’s mascot Speedee, who says, “HOWDY, SCHAUMBURG! McDONALD’S IS ON THE WAY!”

--Kroc and Ethel having dinner again at Rolling Green CC, Kroc working the menfolk, trolling for franchisees.

--Kroc playing a round of golf at the club, giving his golf mates the sales spiel.

--Kroc looking on as one of the golf guys signs a contract.


EXT. MCDONALD’S (SCHAUMBURG) - DAY

Kroc pulls into the parking lot of Jack Horford’s brand-new Schaumburg McDonald’s. There’s a line out front, not spectacular but solid.

He parks, heads toward the restaurant. He slows, noticing something.

KROC’S POV: A patron in his car, biting into a hamburger.
Sticking out the sides of the burger is a PIECE OF LETTUCE.

ON KROC-- staring at the lettuce, disturbed by the sight.


EXT. ROLLING GREEN C.C. - GOLF COURSE - SHORT TIME LATER

Jack Horford, part of a foursome, is about to tee off.

GOLF BUDDY
Give it a whack, Jack.

Horford rears back to swing when, out the corner of his eye, he sees--

KROC, storming onto the course, marching toward him.

As Kroc gets closer, Horford sees he’s holding something...
a HAMBURGER. Kroc gets right up in his face with it.

RAY KROC
What is this?

Horford stares at the burger.
 
51.


JACK HORFORD
It appears to be a hamburger.

RAY KROC
It’s not a McDonald’s hamburger.

He lifts off the bun, pointing out its myriad deficiencies--

RAY KROC (CONT’D)
Too much ketchup. Three pickles not two. Lettuce. Lettuce, Jack?

JACK HORFORD
Do you think we could discuss this later? We’re in the middle of--

RAY KROC
And the patty.
(breaks it open)

Tragically overcooked.

JERRY CULLEN (O.S.)
I don’t know, Ray...

Fellow franchise owner Jerry Cullen (part of the foursome) leans in, checking out the burger.

JERRY CULLEN (CONT’D)
Looks good to me.

RAY KROC
(glares at Cullen)

What the heck would you know about quality?

ON CULLEN-- thrown.

RAY KROC (CONT’D)
I dropped in on your store today. I must say, I was quite disturbed.

JERRY CULLEN
What by?

RAY KROC
For starters, the menu... Corn on

the cob?

JERRY CULLEN
What’s wrong with corn on the cob?

RAY KROC
Fried chicken?
 
52.


JERRY CULLEN
People love fried chicken.

RAY KROC
Then they can go to a restaurant

that serves it!

Cullen and Horford trade glances, bewildered.

RAY KROC (CONT’D)
And the filth. The kitchen looked like some sort of Manchurian slum.

JERRY CULLEN
(smirk)

With great chicken.

Everybody laughs. Kroc is not amused.

RAY KROC
(to both of them)

Are you aware of what goes on at your restaurants? Do you even care?

JERRY CULLEN
Look, Ray, I don’t know about you, but I’m retired.

JACK HORFORD
You said this’d be a good place to park our money. It’s an investment, nothing more.

JERRY CULLEN
If I wanted a job, I’da applied for a cook position.

ON KROC-- silently stewing.


INT. KROC’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Ethel is getting dressed, putting on jewelry and makeup. Ray enters, home from work.

ETHEL KROC
Hurry up and get changed. Dinner’s called for seven.

RAY KROC
We’re not going to the club

tonight.
 
53.


ETHEL KROC
You cancelled our dinner plans?

RAY KROC
I cancelled our membership.

ETHEL KROC
What?

RAY KROC
Those Rolling Green people aren’t

our kind.

ETHEL KROC
What are you talking about?

RAY KROC
I’ve lost interest in hobnobbing

with the idle rich.

ETHEL KROC
Idle rich?

RAY KROC
With their golf and their Rob Roys.

ETHEL KROC
Please tell me this is a joke.

RAY KROC
Contented. Complacent.

ETHEL KROC
Those are my friends, Ray. My

entire social life!

RAY KROC
We’ll find new friends.

Ethel throws herself onto the bed, bursting into tears.

RAY KROC (CONT’D)
Far more suitable.


EXT. MCDONALD’S (SCHAUMBURG) - DAY

Kroc sits in his car across the street from Jack Horford’s McDonald’s, anonymously watching--

KROC’S POV: A crowd of ANNOYED CUSTOMERS waiting for their food. A customer checks his watch.
 
54.


CUSTOMER
(to cashier)

How much longer?

Kroc watches the shabbily run operation, sickened. He takes a swig from his flask.

The pre-lap sound of VOMITING carries over to--


INT. PRINCE CASTLE SALES - MEN’S ROOM - DAY

Kroc bent over the toilet, puking his guts out.


INT. OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

Kroc exits the bathroom, walks toward the FRONT DESK carrying the men’s room key.

SALESMAN (O.S.)
Just take a gander at this handsome gold inlay.

Kroc comes to the desk, where he sees a BIBLE SALESMAN (23) talking to June, briefcase full of samples popped open.

SALESMAN (CONT’D) You’re telling me such spectacular craftsmanship isn’t worth $8.95?

JUNE MARTINO
Thank you, I’m not interested.

SALESMAN
Not interested in a Bible sure to be the pride of your home library?

ON KROC-- observing the young salesman.

SALESMAN (CONT’D)
As you no doubt know, June, envy is one of the seven deadly sins. And that’s just what your friends and neighbors will be guilty of when they see this leather-bound beauty on your bookshelf.

JUNE MARTINO
Sir, this is a private place of
business. I’m afraid I’m going to

have to ask you to leave.
 
55.


BEAT. The salesman gathers up his things, heads out of the office. June’s telephone rings.

JUNE MARTINO (CONT’D)
Prince Castle Sales.
(BEAT, listening)

Oh, hello, Mac.

Kroc hears the name. A knot instantly forms in his stomach.

JUNE MARTINO (CONT’D)
One moment, I’ll see if he’s in.

She covers the phone, turns to Kroc.

JUNE MARTINO (CONT’D) It’s Mac... just wants to know how it’s going.

ON KROC-- frozen, staring at the phone.


INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

The salesman heading down the hall toward the elevator.

RAY KROC (O.S.)
Wait!

The salesman slows, turns. Standing there is Kroc, looking him over, sizing him up.

RAY KROC (CONT’D)
What’s your name?

SALESMAN
Leonard. Leonard Rosenblatt.

RAY KROC
Rosenblatt.

ON KROC-- digesting the name, intrigued.

RAY KROC (CONT’D)
What’s a Jew doing selling Catholic

Bibles?

LEONARD ROSENBLATT
(unapologetic)

Making a living.

ON KROC-- taking in the hungry young go-getter. It’s not hard to read his mind. This is just the sort of fella I need.
 
56.


INT. KROC’S OFFICE - DAY

Rosenblatt and his wife MYRA (22) sit across from Kroc. Kroc slides a pen and contract to them.

ON LEONARD AND MYRA ROSENBLATT-- looking at each other. Excited, hopeful. A young couple, staking everything on a shared dream. Myra gives his hand a squeeze.

MYRA ROSENBLATT
I believe in you.

LEONARD ROSENBLATT
Us, Myra.

ON KROC-- watching the interaction with admiration--and a touch of jealousy.


EXT. MCDONALD’S (THE ROSENBLATTS’) - DAY (A FEW MONTHS LATER)

The Rosenblatts’ new McDonald’s in Waukegan, IL. Festive bunting lines the front, a banner proclaiming GRAND OPENING TODAY! A line of the curious and hungry forms outside.


INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

The hustle and bustle of a smooth-running kitchen. It’s a model of cleanliness and professionalism, everything the country clubbers’ locations were not.

ON KROC-- in the middle of it all, observing, highly pleased.

LEONARD ROSENBLATT (O.S.)
Let’s go, chop-chop!

ON ROSENBLATT-- moving around the kitchen, barking out orders, making sure everything’s just so.

MYRA ROSENBLATT (O.S.)
Here y’go, champ!

Kroc looks toward the front of the store, where he sees...

Myra, handing out lollipops to children. She’s wearing a red apron that says MCDONALD’S--and a big smile on her face.

Kroc goes over. She hands him a lollipop.

MYRA ROSENBLATT (CONT’D) It’s normally ten and under, but for you I’ll make an exception.
 
57.


Kroc looks at the lollipop. Tied to it is a ribbon with the store’s address on it. He couldn’t be more impressed.

RAY KROC (PRE-LAP)
You shoulda seen ‘em.


INT. KROC’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - THAT NIGHT

Kroc is getting undressed for bed, buzzing.

RAY KROC
You’ve never seen a pair of dynamos like these two.

ON ETHEL-- in bed, half-listening, about to fall asleep.

RAY KROC (CONT’D)
He’s in back, running the kitchen, she’s up front, passing out suckers to the kiddies. Like a real team.
(BEAT)
It’s wonderful. Don’t you think?

No reply from the sleepy Ethel. He gives her a poke.

RAY KROC (CONT’D)
Don’t you?

ETHEL KROC
Don’t I what?

RAY KROC
Think it’s wonderful.
(angling)
Two people, side by side, working

together...

ETHEL KROC
Are you trying to hire me, Ray?

RAY KROC
You say you never see me anymore.

This is a perfect way.

ETHEL KROC
I don’t want to work for you.

RAY KROC
With me. Husband and wife, united

in labor and in life. You know?

ETHEL KROC
I mean...
 
58.


ON ETHEL-- pondering, really struggling with the notion.

ETHEL KROC (CONT’D)
Not really.

A stretch of tense, edgy silence.

RAY KROC
I made us supper plans for Friday.

ETHEL KROC
I don’t suppose you rejoined

Rolling Green.

RAY KROC
No.
(gazes off)

Someplace far better.


INT. VFW HALL - EVENING

ANGLE ON a big banner across a wood-paneled wall: VFW POST 482 - FRIDAY NIGHT POTLUCK DINNER & BINGO

PAN DOWN to a long table lined with couples. Blue-collar types, several rungs down the social ladder from Rolling Green. And younger, average age closer to 30 than 60.

In the midst of them, we find Ray and Ethel. They’re dressed deliberately “blue collar”, matching the people around them.

ON ETHEL-- edgily pushing her meatloaf and mashed potatoes around her plate.

RAY KROC (O.S.)
So, Art, what do you do for a

living?

Kroc is chatting up the COUPLE (mid-20s) next to them.

ART WOLODARSKY
Well, I had a little plumbing
business going for a while after
getting out of the service. Now I
sell vacuum cleaners. And give

piano lessons on the side.

RAY KROC
Golly. Plumbing, pianos, you’re a

regular jack of all trades.

ART WOLODARSKY
Whatever puts food on the table.
 
59.


Art’s WIFE smiles proudly at her hard-working man.

ON KROC-- sizing them up. They fit the profile to a T.

RAY KROC
How would you like to do more than merely “put food on the table”?

CUT TO:


INT. KROC’S OFFICE - SHORT TIME LATER

Art Wolodarsky signing up for a franchise, his faithful wife by his side. This leads to--


RECRUITMENT MONTAGE:

Kroc hunting for new recruits for the McDonald’s Army. Quick cuts of Kroc making the SAME SPEECH in various places. Shriners halls, synagogues, Amway meetings:

RAY KROC
I’m looking for a few good men! Hustlers! Scrappers! Grinders! Men willing to roll up their sleeves, men with fire in their bellies!
(BEAT)
I stand before you today offering something more precious than gold: opportunity. Opportunity to advance. To succeed. To get your shot at the brass ring, the American Dream. For McDonald’s, like this great nation itself, is a true meritocracy. If you’re willing to put in the work, if you’ve got the gumption and the guts and the desire, the sky’s the limit at McDonald’s. Put in the necessary elbow grease and, by gum, I promise you there’s a pot of gold waiting for you at the end of those Golden Arches. So who’s with me? Who’s ready to strap it on and step onto that first rung of the ladder of success? Who’s ready to make that glorious upward climb, ascending into the hard-won heavens of success and prosperity?

Shots of Kroc gaining traction, getting on a roll:
 
60.


--YOUNG COUPLES cashing out bank accounts.

--Kroc cutting the ribbon at store openings. Lines down the block. Cash registers ringing.

--Kroc biting into a burger served by the owner-operator of a new franchise. Art Wolodarsky.

--Kroc driving back to his own store in Des Plaines, sweeping the lot after dark. Relentless. Inexhaustible. Obsessed.

END OF MONTAGE.


INT. EASTERN AIRLINES - DAY

A flight in mid-air. Kroc, in a window seat, gazes out at the flat, snow-dusted expanse below. Next to him is Fred Turner, head buried in a McDonald’s operations manual.

FLIGHT ATTENDANT (O.S.) Ladies and gentlemen, we are about to begin our initial descent into Minneapolis-St. Paul.


EXT. MCDONALD’S - SHORT TIME LATER

Kroc and Turner pull up to a brand-new McDonald’s in a taxi. Stretched across the front is a banner: MINNESOTA IS MCDONALD’S COUNTRY! They step out of the cab.

JIM ZIEN (O.S.)
Welcome!

JIM ZIEN, the store’s burly, gregarious owner, comes out to greet them. With a showman’s flourish, he gestures to a pair of HIGH-SCHOOL CHEERLEADERS in McDonald’s red and white.

JIM ZIEN (CONT’D)
Gimme an M!

CHEERLEADERS
M!

JIM ZIEN
Gimme a C!

CHEERLEADERS
C!

ON KROC-- beaming, eating up the red-carpet reception.
 
61.


JIM ZIEN (O.S.)
Gimme a D!

CHEERLEADERS (O.S.)
D!


INT. ROLLIE’S STEAKHOUSE - LATER/EVENING

Kroc, Turner and Zien at a Minneapolis steakhouse. The WAITER is taking their orders.

RAY KROC
Ribeye. Bloody.
(hands waiter menu,
smiles)

I want the cow still mooing.

Everybody chuckles. Kroc is really feeling his oats.

RAY KROC (CONT’D)
And a couple sides of creamed

spinach for the table.


SHORT TIME LATER--

Kroc is tucking into his enormous, bloody steak.

JIM ZIEN
How is it?

RAY KROC
You couldn’t top this in Chicago.

JIM ZIEN
We don’t mess around up here.

RAY KROC
My compliments to the chef.

JIM ZIEN
I’ll do you one better. How about

the owner?

With this, Zien waves at someone across the room. A MAN comes over, gives Zien a chummy back-pat.

MAN
Jimmy! Good to see ya!

We get the distinct sense this was pre-arranged.
 
62.


MAN (CONT’D)
Everything alright tonight?

JIM ZIEN
Wonderful as always, Rollie.

Zien gestures toward his VIP guest--

JIM ZIEN (CONT’D)
Rollie Smith, Ray Kroc.

This is ROLLIE SMITH, the owner. He enthusiastically shakes Kroc’s hand.

ROLLIE SMITH
A pleasure.

RAY KROC
You’ve got one helluva restaurant

here.

ROLLIE SMITH
Coming from you, that’s quite a

compliment.

RAY KROC
(pleased)

I see my reputation precedes me.

ROLLIE SMITH
I’m a great admirer.

Kroc gestures to an empty chair, eager for more flattery.

ROLLIE SMITH (CONT’D)
(fake-demurring)

I don’t want to interrupt.

RAY KROC
Please.

ROLLIE SMITH
Maybe just a minute.

ONE HOUR LATER--

A BUSBOY is clearing plates. Smith is still at the table.

ROLLIE SMITH (CONT’D) Well, you’ve certainly found a warm and loving home here in Minneapolis.
 
63.


RAY KROC
So it seems.

ROLLIE SMITH
This town just can’t get enough of

McDonald’s.

Smith raises Kroc’s empty glass to a passing WAITER.

ROLLIE SMITH (CONT’D)
Another Canadian Club for my

friend.

The waiter nods, heads off with the glass.

ROLLIE SMITH (CONT’D)
(resuming--)

In fact, I’d say there’s sufficient enthusiasm to support another.

RAY KROC
A second location?

ROLLIE SMITH
And come to think of it, I can think of the perfect person to own and operate.

RAY KROC
(gamely playing along)

You don’t say.

ROLLIE SMITH
Somebody who knows what it takes to build a great restaurant. Someone with more than 25 years experience in the food-service industry.

RAY KROC
Who?

ROLLIE SMITH
Me!

RAY KROC
Oh!

ON KROC-- deeply enjoying this. For a man who’s spent his life groveling, sucking up to people, trying to curry favor, to be on the receiving end is a thrilling new experience.

ROLLIE SMITH
I’ve got the know-how. I’ve got the backers. And I’ve got the location.
 
64.


A PIANO is heard in the background. Light, lovely tinkling.

ROLLIE SMITH (O.S.) (CONT’D) Are you familiar with Hennepin Avenue?

ON KROC-- distracted, looking toward the piano.

ROLLIE SMITH (CONT’D) It’s one of the busiest commercial arteries in the whole Twin Cities. There’s a prime site that recently became available, a full acre on the corner of Hennepin and...
(sees Kroc not listening)

Mr. Kroc?

Kroc is staring off, transfixed. Smith follows his gaze to--

An ATTRACTIVE BLONDE, early 30s, playing a BABY GRAND PIANO in the corner. Smith watches Kroc watch her, clearly smitten.

ROLLIE SMITH (CONT’D)
Would you like to meet her?

This gets Kroc’s attention.


MOMENTS LATER--

Smith is at the piano, leaning in to the woman’s ear, saying something. She gets up, goes over to the table with him.

ROLLIE SMITH
Ray Kroc, meet Joan Smith.
(BEAT)

My wife.


SHORT TIME LATER--

Joan is sitting next to Kroc, hanging on his every word.

RAY KROC
...Milwaukee, Kenosha, Grand Rapids and the three Chicago area.

JOAN SMITH
Goodness.

RAY KROC
Oh, and Dayton, Ohio.
 
65.


JOAN SMITH
All in the last 12 months?

RAY KROC
Nine.

JOAN SMITH
Nine? You must be positively dizzy,

Mr. Kroc!

RAY KROC
Please. Call me Ray.

JOAN SMITH
(eye contact, purr)

Ray...

Kroc blushes, defenseless against the ego-stroking of a pretty blonde.

ROLLIE SMITH
That’s some growth.

JOAN SMITH
When did you start it?

RAY KROC
(caught off guard)

Hm?

JOAN SMITH
What year, did you start

McDonald’s?

BEAT. Kroc looks at Joan looking at him. So beautiful. So impressed.

RAY KROC
1954.

A BEAT as the lie settles. She smiles.

JOAN SMITH
Remarkable.

Kroc smiles back. She’s got him wrapped around her finger.

JOAN SMITH (CONT’D)
I should probably get back.

RAY KROC
To where?
 
66.


JOAN SMITH
The piano.

RAY KROC
Of course.

He nods, privately disappointed.

JOAN SMITH
What’s your favorite song?
(BEAT)

All-time favorite.

He thinks for a BEAT.

RAY KROC
“Pennies From Heaven”.

Joan gets up, heads over to the piano. She starts to play.
Ray immediately recognizes the melody.

JOAN SMITH
Every time it rains, it rains/

Pennies from heaven...

ON KROC-- charmed, immensely turned on.

JOAN SMITH (CONT’D) Don't you know each cloud contains/ Pennies from heaven?

Kroc gets up, heads to the piano. Takes a seat on the bench next to her. Removing her hands from the keys, he starts to PLAY THE SONG. And sing.

RAY KROC
You'll find your fortune fallin’
all over town/ Be sure that your

umbrella is upside down...

ON JOAN-- surprised and amazed. He leans in, sotto voce:

RAY KROC (CONT’D)
Worked as an organ salesman for a

few years.

She smiles, charmed. Possibly genuine.

RAY KROC (CONT’D)
Trade them for a package of
sunshine and flowers...
(to Joan)

Join in.
 
67.


She does--

RAY KROC AND JOAN SMITH
If you want the things you love,

you must have showers...

ON THE ROOM-- eating up the surprise duet. Including Rollie.

RAY KROC AND JOAN SMITH (CONT’D)
So when you hear it thunder, don't run under a tree/ There'll be pennies from heaven for you and me

BIG APPLAUSE. Kroc stands up and takes a bow, basking in it.
Joan stands up, clapping too.

JOAN SMITH
Bravo, Ray!


INT. AIRPLANE - DAY (THE FLIGHT HOME)

Kroc gazes out the window in a state of dreamy reverie. It’s not hard to tell what (or who) he’s thinking about.


INT. KROC’S HOUSE - DAY

Kroc enters the house. Ethel is in a living-room chair reading a Barbara Cartland romance novel.

ETHEL KROC
How was the trip?

RAY KROC
You want to know?

ETHEL KROC
I’m asking.

RAY KROC
It was... triumphant.
(BEAT)

They rolled out the red carpet for me. I was welcomed like a king. Wherever I went, I was showered with adulation. Admiration. Respect. People were kneeling before me, kissing my ring, practically begging for a McDonald’s.

A BEAT as Ethel absorbs.
 
68.


ETHEL KROC
That’s nice.

RAY KROC
It was.

ETHEL KROC
I’m sure.

She nods to herself, hard to read.

ETHEL KROC (CONT’D)
Pope Raymond The First.


INT. KROC’S OFFICE - DAY

Kroc stands before a U.S. MAP on the wall. There are a dozen or so PUSH PINS stuck in it, mostly clustered around Chicago and the upper Midwest.

ON KROC-- surveying the map with the bearing of a general, hands clasped behind his back.

JUNE MARTINO (O.S.)
Sir?

June is standing by the door.

JUNE MARTINO (CONT’D)
We have a small problem.


INT. KROC’S OFFICE - DAY

Kroc at his desk with June. Spread out before them is the company’s FINANCIAL LEDGER, open to a page.

RAY KROC
How could we be almost out of

capital?

JUNE MARTINO
Well...

She runs her finger down a column of figures.

RAY KROC
What’s that?

JUNE MARTINO
Your revenue. The monthly cut of

the stores.
 
69.


RAY KROC
That’s it?

JUNE MARTINO
1.4 percent of net.

RAY KROC
1.4?

JUNE MARTINO
1.9, minus Dick and Mac’s half

percent.

She seems way more familiar with the terms than he does.


SHORT TIME LATER--

Kroc is looking at his contract. A passage we glimpsed earlier, at the signing:

...SHALL RECEIVE ONE AND NINE-TENTHS PERCENT (1.9%) OF NET PROFITS GENERATED BY FRANCHISEE(S), WITH ONE-HALF OF ONE PERCENT (0.5%) OF SAID NET PROFITS PAID TO RICHARD MCDONALD AND MAURICE MCDONALD...

Kroc shakes his head, not happy.


EXT. MCDONALD’S (SAN BERNARDINO) - SHORT TIME LATER

Dick is accepting a large shipment of cups and plastic ware.
He signs, hands the clipboard back to the DELIVERY MAN.

EMPLOYEE (O.S.)
Mr. McDonald?

Dick turns, sees a YOUNG EMPLOYEE.

EMPLOYEE (CONT’D)
Ray Kroc on the line.


INT. BACK OFFICE - SHORT TIME LATER

Mac stands behind Dick, who picks up the phone, both of them bracing for it.

DICK MCDONALD
Hiya, Ray.

RAY KROC (O.S.)
I want to renegotiate.
 
70.


DICK MCDONALD
Renegotiate what?


INT. KROC’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Kroc paces, contract in hand. (Intercut as necessary.)

RAY KROC
My deal. My lousy deal.

Dick looks totally taken aback.

RAY KROC (CONT’D)
1.4 is barely enough to cover my
monthly nut, much less drive

expansion.

DICK MCDONALD
Ray, those are the terms.

RAY KROC
It’s not enough.

DICK MCDONALD
It’s more than triple our cut.

RAY KROC
Then you oughta be getting more,

too.

DICK MCDONALD
I’m not a greedy man.

RAY KROC
It’s not about greed, it’s about taking care of ourselves so we can take care of this company. If I had more money to work with, we could be growing at twice the pace.

DICK MCDONALD
I have no beef with the current

rate of expansion.

RAY KROC
We haven’t got a single location in

New York. Pennsylvania.

DICK MCDONALD
All in good time.

RAY KROC
Texas!
