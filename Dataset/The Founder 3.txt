DICK MCDONALD
I have no doubt it’ll come.

RAY KROC
I’ve been busting my hump for you

boys.

DICK MCDONALD
And you’re doing a bang-up job.

RAY KROC
Then I ought to be doing better

than just breaking even.

DICK MCDONALD
I don’t know what to say.

RAY KROC
Say you’ll renegotiate.

DICK MCDONALD
I can’t.

RAY KROC
Can’t or won’t?

DICK MCDONALD
Upping your cut, it wouldn’t be

fair to the franchisees.

RAY KROC
The franchisees are doing just fine. I’m the one drowning. Between your molasses approval process and the meager cut...

DICK MCDONALD
You freely and willingly agreed to the terms of your deal, Ray. Nobody put a gun to your head.

RAY KROC
Four percent.

DICK MCDONALD
No.

RAY KROC
Three and a half.

DICK MCDONALD
Ray...
 
72.


RAY KROC
What?

DICK MCDONALD
No.

RAY KROC
GODDAMMIT!

He hangs up.


KITCHEN - SHORT TIME LATER

Post-call. Dick is gazing off stormily.

MAC MCDONALD
Is he a pain in the rear? Yes. Has he got a few screws loose? Maybe. But that doesn’t mean he’s going to do us any harm.

DICK MCDONALD
How long are you going to keep this up, Mac?

MAC MCDONALD
Keep what up?

DICK MCDONALD
The whole “everything is fine” act.
(eye contact)

There’s a wolf in the henhouse! And we let him in!

ON MAC-- looking nauseous. Guilty.

DICK MCDONALD (CONT’D)
I never should have listened.

MAC MCDONALD
We have a contract, Dick. For just this sort of thing.

DICK MCDONALD
I should have trusted my gut.

MAC MCDONALD
He’s powerless.

BEAT. Dick shakes his head grimly.

MAC MCDONALD (CONT’D)
I’m sorry, Dick.
 
73.


Dick is silent, furious at his brother. At himself.

MAC MCDONALD (CONT’D)
I just wanted you to have your...

He trails off, seemingly losing his train of thought.

MAC MCDONALD (CONT’D)
I just wanted...

His face grows flushed. Dick sees something is off.

DICK MCDONALD
Mac.

MAC MCDONALD
I’m sorry, Dickie...

ON DICK-- recognizing what this is.

MAC MCDONALD (CONT’D)
I didn’t mean to leave the gate

open...

DICK MCDONALD
Take a seat.

MAC MCDONALD
I didn’t mean to let Boomer get

out...

DICK MCDONALD
(moving toward brother)

Mac, you’re having one of your--

CRASH. Mac flops over, crashing to the floor.


SAN BERNARDINO - KITCHEN - SHORT TIME LATER

Mac is sitting on the floor nursing a milkshake. Next to him is a tin box marked GLUCAGON EMERGENCY KIT.

DICK MCDONALD
A few more sips.

Mac takes a sip of the shake. His sleeves are rolled up, revealing a MEDIC ALERT BRACELET. Engraved on it is DIABETES TYPE 1.

MAC MCDONALD
I’m okay.

ON DICK-- looking at his brother with love and worry.
 
74.


ON MAC-- gazing off at something...

The Multimixer on the counter. Kroc’s machine, used to make the shake in his hands.


INT. KROC’S OFFICE - DAY

Kroc sits at his desk. Next to a bottle of Canadian Club is a pile of BILLS AND INVOICES. He picks one up. It’s from ILLINOIS FIRST FEDERAL, stamped PAST DUE. He picks up another one. From CHICAGO GAS & ELECTRIC. He stares at the amount owed.

RAY KROC (PRE-LAP)
Ninety-four dollars?


INT. MCDONALD’S (DES PLAINES) - COOLER - SHORT TIME LATER

Kroc in the walk-in cooler with Fred Turner. In Kroc’s hand is the Chicago Gas & Electric bill.

FRED TURNER
It’s unbelievable what these

suckers cost to run.

Kroc shakes his head, a knot in his stomach.

FRED TURNER (CONT’D)
My pop used to own an ice-cream
parlor. He went belly-up from the

refrigeration costs.

Kroc’s eye drifts to the left side of the cooler. The entire side is filled with drums of ice cream (for the milkshakes).

ON KROC-- staring at the drums.


INT. KROC’S HOUSE - ENTRANCE/LIVING ROOM - DAY

Kroc enters the house. He hangs up his coat and makes a beeline for the liquor cabinet, pours himself a stiff drink.

ETHEL KROC (O.S.)
A man called today.

Kroc turns, startled to see Ethel in a recliner in a corner of the darkened room.

RAY KROC
Ethel.
 
75.


ETHEL KROC
From a bank.

RAY KROC
Alright...

ETHEL KROC
Illinois First Federal.

RAY KROC
What did they want?

ETHEL KROC
You don’t know?

RAY KROC
Why would I?

She gives him an unnerving stare.

RAY KROC (CONT’D)
What?

ETHEL KROC
Ray...
(eye contact)

Did you mortgage our home?

ON KROC-- a deer in the headlights.


INT. ILLINOIS FIRST FEDERAL - DAY

Kroc marches through the bank to Harvey Peltz’s desk.

RAY KROC
I specifically said the office is

the best place to reach me!

ON PELTZ-- taken aback by the intrusion.

HARVEY PELTZ
I tried you there, Mr. Kroc.

Numerous times.

RAY KROC
You have no right to call me at my home. It is a blatant invasion of privacy.
 
76.


HARVEY PELTZ
With all due respect, sir, when you’re three months behind on your payments, you don’t get to pick and choose where you’re contacted.


INT. KROC’S CAR - DAY

Kroc driving along a highway. A sign appears ahead:

MINNEAPOLIS - 377 MILES


EXT. MCDONALD’S (ROLLIE SMITH) - NIGHT

Kroc approaches a gleaming new McDonald’s in downtown Minneapolis. He looks through a window, into the store.

ON KROC-- gazing.

KROC’S POV: Joan Smith in a McDonald’s apron, looking just adorable. Pretty much his fantasy image of a woman.

Out the corner of her eye, she sees Kroc through the glass.
She heads out to him.

JOAN SMITH
Ray?

RAY KROC
(jokey)

Surprise inspection!

JOAN SMITH
What are you doing here?

RAY KROC
Just thought I’d fly up, see how

things are going.

She smiles, impressed. It makes him feel great.


INT. ROLLIE’S STEAKHOUSE - LATER

Kroc having dinner with Rollie and Joan.

ROLLIE SMITH
$12,400.

RAY KROC
That’s some haul for month one.
 
77.


ROLLIE SMITH
And once we clear start-up costs...

RAY KROC
You’ll be looking at a tidy little profit.

Rollie and Joan nod, buzzing over the prospect.

ROLLIE SMITH
Speaking of which: I hate to mix

business with pleasure...

RAY KROC
(wry)

I don’t.

Everyone chuckles. Rollie proceeds.

ROLLIE SMITH
My expenses...

RAY KROC
What about ‘em?

ROLLIE SMITH
Well, they’re a bit higher than
anticipated. One in particular...

That dang walk-in.

ON KROC-- interested to hear more.

ROLLIE SMITH (CONT’D)
The bill’s a real whopper.

RAY KROC
All that ice cream.

ROLLIE SMITH
Exactly.

RAY KROC
It’s a real problem.

A BUSBOY comes by, clears their finished plates.

ROLLIE SMITH
Now, I don’t want to overstep my bounds here, but I think I may have found a solution.
(looks at Joan, proud)

Joan did, actually.
 
78.


RAY KROC
You don’t say.

Kroc turns to Joan, all ears.

JOAN SMITH
(salesman-like)

What if I told you there was a way to save you, us, and all your owner-operators literally hundreds of dollars a year in electrical costs?

Kroc cocks an intrigued eyebrow.

JOAN SMITH (CONT’D)
And free up valuable storage space. And reduce the amount of time it takes to make a milkshake by half.

RAY KROC
I’ll bite.

She reaches under the table, pulls out her purse. She takes out a copy of RESTAURANT BUSINESS MONTHLY, slides it to Kroc.

JOAN SMITH
Page 22.

Kroc opens the trade publication to page 22. A FULL-PAGE AD for something called INST-A-MIX. The ad copy trumpets:

ATTENTION RESTAURANT OPERATORS! INTRODUCING INST-A-MIX, THE MIRACULOUS INSTANT ICE-CREAM SUBSTITUTE THAT WILL SAVE YOU ‘SCOOPFULS’ OF TIME AND MONEY!

GREATER VOLUME! HIGHER PROFITS! MAKES REFRIGERATION A THING OF THE PAST!

JOAN SMITH (CONT’D)
A powdered milkshake. Costs a
fraction of ice cream, no

refrigeration necessary.

ROLLIE SMITH
Thickening agents and emulsifiers
simulate the texture of milk fat.

Tastes just like the real thing.

JOAN KROC
And it’s easy as pie to prepare. Just pour the convenient single-serving packet into water and stir.
 
79.


ON KROC-- staring at the ad poker-faced. Rollie and Joan can’t get a read on his reaction.

ROLLIE SMITH
I realize it may seem a tad blasphemous, what with your dairy-sector background and all.

JOAN SMITH
But personally...

Joan looks at Kroc, touches his hand.

JOAN SMITH (CONT’D)
I think it’s a marvelous idea.

ON KROC-- privately quivering at the touch.

WAITER (O.S.)
Could I interest anyone in dessert?

The WAITER holds out a dessert menu to the table.

ROLLIE SMITH
No thanks, Vic.
(to Kroc, cryptic smile)

We brought our own.


MOMENTS LATER--

ANGLE ON a pair of SILVER-FOIL PACKETS in front of Joan.

JOAN SMITH
Chocolate or vanilla?

RAY KROC
Vanilla.

Joan takes one of the packets, marked “V”, dumps the powdery contents into a glass. She pours in some water, stirs.

ON KROC-- watching with fascination as it thickens. Within seconds, it transforms into what looks like a vanilla shake.

Joan slides it to Kroc. All eyes on him as he takes a sip. A long, anxious BEAT from the table.

JOAN SMITH
What do you think?

RAY KROC
I think... I’m drinking a delicious vanilla shake!
 
80.


The table erupts in happy, relieved laughter.

JOAN SMITH
May I?

Kroc follows her eyes to the shake. He gives her a “be my guest” nod. She raises the glass to her lips, takes a long, languorous sip. Kroc watches, highly turned on.

She puts the glass down, smiles at Kroc.

JOAN SMITH (CONT’D)
I couldn’t resist.

Kroc’s gaze drifts to the glass. On the rim is a bright-red LIPSTICK MARK. He stares at it.

ROLLIE SMITH (O.S.)
So whaddaya say?

Kroc looks at Rollie, shaken out of his moment.

ROLLIE SMITH (CONT’D)
We try it out at our place. Then,

if it goes well...

JOAN SMITH
You roll it out nationally.

ON KROC-- suddenly a tad queasy, thinking of the brothers. He nods vaguely.

RAY KROC
I could.

A strange, shaky BEAT.

RAY KROC (CONT’D)
Let me think about it.

Rollie and Joan nod, surprised. They were expecting a big, unreserved yes.

ROLLIE SMITH
Of course. You’re the boss.

Kroc nods, privately churning. If they only knew.


INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Kroc is sitting on the bed looking at the Inst-A-Mix ad in “Restaurant Business Monthly”. On the nightstand is a pint of Four Roses bourbon, empty. He dials the phone.
 
81.


RAY KROC
Just hear me out.


INT. MCDONALD’S (SAN BERNARDINO) - NIGHT

The restaurant is closed. Dick is on the front-counter phone.

DICK MCDONALD
(instantly wary)

Hello, Ray.

ON MAC-- cleaning up in the background. His ears prick up.

RAY KROC
What if I told you there was a way to save you, me, and all our owner-operators literally hundreds of dollars a year in electrical costs?

DICK MCDONALD
And what would that be?

RAY KROC
Two words: Powdered milkshake.

(before Dick can reply--) There’s a remarkable new product I recently came across called Inst-A-Mix. It’s a powdered milkshake, costs a fraction of ice cream, no refrigeration necessary.

DICK MCDONALD
Ray--

RAY KROC
I tried it, and let me tell you, it is delicious. Tastes just like the real thing.

DICK MCDONALD
Is this some sort of joke?

RAY KROC
Comes in vanilla or chocolate.

DICK MCDONALD
Ray.

RAY KROC
Me, I’m a vanilla man.
 
82.


DICK MCDONALD
I have no interest in a milkshake

that contains no milk.

RAY KROC
You won’t be able to tell the

difference. Guarantee.

DICK MCDONALD
Why don’t we put sawdust in the

hamburgers while we’re at it?

RAY KROC
I’m being serious.

DICK MCDONALD
Frozen french fries!

RAY KROC
You don’t want to save a bundle?

DICK MCDONALD
Not like that.

RAY KROC
We’re talking the same great taste while boosting your bottom line.

DICK MCDONALD
It’s called a milk shake, Ray.

RAY KROC
Not to mention freeing up all that cooler space. I don’t know about you, but I’d sure like to--

DICK MCDONALD
Milk. Now and forever.

ON KROC-- shut down. Yet again.

RAY KROC
Well, thanks for giving it your
full and sincere consideration.
(fed up)

As always.


MOTEL ROOM - SHORT TIME LATER

Kroc silently gazes off. He FLINGS THE MAGAZINE across the room, knocking over a lamp.
 
83.


INT. KROC’S OFFICE - DAY

Kroc stares at the ever-growing mountain of bills on his desk. His gaze drifts to a letter from ILLINOIS FIRST FEDERAL marked FINAL NOTICE.


INT. ILLINOIS FIRST FEDERAL - DAY

Kroc is sitting with Harvey Peltz, his home-mortgage officer.

RAY KROC
You’ve got to extend my line.

HARVEY PELTZ
Until you build more equity in your home or pay down the loan...

RAY KROC
My business is booming.

HARVEY PELTZ
Unfortunately, that’s immaterial.

RAY KROC
Thirteen locations in nine states!

HARVEY PELTZ
It’s a home-equity loan.

RAY KROC
Then give me a business loan.

REVEAL, on the other side of a partition: a patrician, silver-haired BUSINESSMAN sitting across from an empty chair, listening in as he waits for his banker to return.

HARVEY PELTZ
These 13 locations. They’re yours?

RAY KROC
Meaning?

HARVEY PELTZ
You own them?

RAY KROC
I mean, not in the strict sense.

HARVEY PELTZ
So then what are your assets?

RAY KROC
Mine personally?
 
84.


HARVEY PELTZ
It is your business, correct? You

own it?

RAY KROC
Not technically, per se.

The businessman cringes for the poor, floundering schlub on the other side of the partition.

RAY KROC (CONT’D)
I’m the head of franchising. I’m

the one behind all the growth.

HARVEY PELTZ
That’s all well and good, but--

RAY KROC
Have you ever been to a McDonald’s?

The name catches the businessman’s ear.

RAY KROC (CONT’D)
We’ve got three stores right here
in the Chicagoland area. Perhaps if

you swung by, took a look.

HARVEY PELTZ
That’s quite alright.

RAY KROC
I’d be happy to give you a tour,

give you a better sense of--

HARVEY PELTZ
Thank you. I’ve got the gist.


EXT. ILLINOIS FIRST FEDERAL - MOMENTS LATER

Kroc exits the bank in defeat. He slumps off toward his car.

BUSINESSMAN
Mr. Kroc.

Kroc turns, sees the man approaching. Kroc looks him over. Dressed in an impeccably tailored suit, he has the finished, cosmopolitan air of a New Yorker.

RAY KROC
Can I help you?

BUSINESSMAN
No. But perhaps I can help you.
 
85.


He hands Kroc a business card. Kroc looks at it:

HARRY J. SONNEBORN - VICE-PRESIDENT OF FINANCE - THE TASTEE-FREEZ CORPORATION

RAY KROC
Thanks. We’re perfectly happy with our current supplier.

Kroc hands back the card, starts to walk off.

HARRY SONNEBORN
I’m not looking to sell you ice

cream.

RAY KROC
Then what do you want?

HARRY SONNEBORN
I caught a bit of your conversation back there. Sounds like you’re having some financial troubles.

RAY KROC
Why don’t you mind your own

business?

HARRY SONNEBORN
I’m a great admirer of your

establishment.

RAY KROC
That’s very nice.

HARRY SONNEBORN
I lunch at your Waukegan location at least thrice a week. And not once have I ever failed to witness a large, avid crowd.

RAY KROC
Your point being...

HARRY SONNEBORN
If you’re not making money hand
over fist, something is gravely

amiss.

This gets Kroc’s attention.
 
86.


INT. PRINCE CASTLE SALES - SHORT TIME LATER

Kroc enters the office with Sonneborn. As they pass the front desk:

RAY KROC
June, fetch the ledger.


INT. KROC’S OFFICE - SHORT TIME LATER

Kroc and Sonneborn sit in front of the ledger.

HARRY SONNEBORN
So to summarize, you have a
miniscule revenue stream, no cash
reserves, and an albatross of a
contract that requires you to go
through a glacially slow approval
process to enact changes--if
they’re approved at all. Which they
never are.
(BEAT)

Am I missing anything?

RAY KROC
I believe that covers it.

ON SONNEBORN-- thinking.

HARRY SONNEBORN
Tell me about the land.

RAY KROC
Land?

HARRY SONNEBORN
The land, the buildings, how that

whole aspect of it works.

RAY KROC
Well, it’s pretty simple really. The franchisee finds a piece of land he likes, takes out a lease. Usually 20-year. He gets himself a construction loan, puts up the building, and off he goes.

HARRY SONNEBORN
So the operator selects the site.

RAY KROC
Yes.
 
87.


HARRY SONNEBORN
He picks the property. Not you.

Kroc nods, unsure why he’s so curious about all of this.

HARRY SONNEBORN (CONT’D) You supply the training, the system, the operational know-how, and he’s responsible for the rest.

RAY KROC
Correct.

ON SONNEBORN-- processing. He seems troubled.

RAY KROC (CONT’D)
Is there a problem?

HARRY SONNEBORN
A big one.

RAY KROC
Which is?

HARRY SONNEBORN
That you don’t seem to realize what business you’re in.
(BEAT)
You’re not in the burger business.

You’re in the real-estate business.

Kroc looks totally confused.

HARRY SONNEBORN (CONT’D) You don’t build an empire off a 1.4 percent cut of a 15-cent hamburger. You build it by owning the land upon which that burger is cooked.

ON KROC-- wrestling with this strange notion.

HARRY SONNEBORN (CONT’D)
What you ought to be doing is buying up plots of land, then turning around and leasing said plots to franchisees, who as a condition of their deal should be permitted to lease from you and you alone. This will provide you with two things: One, a steady, upfront revenue stream. Money flows in before the first stake is in the ground. Two, greater capital for expansion.

(MORE)
 
88.

HARRY SONNEBORN (CONT’D) Which in turn fuels further land acquisition, which in turn fuels further expansion. And so on and so on.
(BEAT)
Land... That’s where the money is.
(BEAT)

And control. Control over the franchisee: Fail to uphold quality standards, you cancel their lease. Control over Dick and Mac: Their power stops at the building’s foundation. Yours goes to the soil.

ON KROC-- absorbing, registering the full significance.

RAY KROC
If I were to do this... the
brothers... this would

effectively...

HARRY SONNEBORN
Yes.

A long BEAT. Kroc searching his soul. We can almost see the Angel and the Devil on his shoulders.

HARRY SONNEBORN (CONT’D)
So whaddaya say, Ray?


MONTAGE:

The Harry & Ray Show. Sonneborn and Kroc jumping into action:

--Sonneborn taking meetings with BANKERS AND INVESTORS in New York City. Confidently presenting his sweeping vision to conference rooms of heavy hitters. He stands in sharp contrast to Kroc... Kroc is Main Street, Sonneborn is Wall Street. Kroc is a salesman, Sonneborn is a businessman.

--Hands being shaken, deals being struck.

--Kroc criss-crossing the country by plane shopping for land. Scouting suburban neighborhoods, plots of land near schools and churches. Fertile ground for the planting of arches.

--Kroc’s U.S. map filling in with push pins. 15, 20, 30...

--Kroc and Sonneborn presiding over lease signings. MOLINE, NASHVILLE, ORLANDO, KALAMAZOO.

--New franchisees combing through thick, 100-page agreements.
Glimpses of legalese:
 
89.


...ANY AND ALL CHANGES OR MODIFICATIONS MUST BE...

...SHOULD LESSEE FAIL TO UPHOLD STANDARDS OF CONDUCT AND QUALITY AS DEEMED BY LESSOR, LESSOR HAS THE RIGHT TO...

Control. For Kroc.

END OF MONTAGE.


EXT. MCDONALD’S (SAN BERNARDINO) - MORNING

The restaurant, not yet open for the day. A MAILMAN goes over to Dick with a stack of mail. Dick opens a LETTER, troubled by what he sees.


INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Mac is wiping down the front counter.

DICK MCDONALD (O.S.)
Have you heard of the Franchise

Realty Corporation?

Mac turns, sees Dick holding the letter.

MAC MCDONALD
What is it?

DICK MCDONALD
I have no clue. But apparently Ray

Kroc is president and CEO.

Mac takes the letter, instantly nauseous.

ANGLE ON letter, written on FRANCHISE REALTY CORPORATION letterhead. The letter itself is some innocuous bit of McDonald’s business from Kroc to the brothers. It’s really just an excuse to flash the letterhead. And the signature at the bottom: RAYMOND A. KROC - PRESIDENT/CEO


INT. PRINCE CASTLE SALES - SHORT TIME LATER

June is at the front desk. She picks up a ringing phone.

JUNE MARTINO
Franchise Realty Corporation, how

may I direct your call?

Behind her, WORKMEN are taking down the Prince Castle Sales sign and putting up a new one in its place: FRANCHISE REALTY CORPORATION
 
90.


INT. KROC’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

Kroc picks up his phone. (Intercut as necessary.)

RAY KROC
Hello, Dick. How are you?

DICK MCDONALD
Well, if you really want to know,

I’m tad miffed.

RAY KROC
What seems to be the trouble?

DICK MCDONALD
Franchise Realty Corporation.

RAY KROC
What about it?

DICK MCDONALD
For starters, would you mind

telling me what it is?

RAY KROC
Oh, nothing really. Just a little something I created to help provide leasing services and support to our new franchisees.

Dick can practically hear Kroc’s smirk through the phone.

DICK MCDONALD
You know full well you can’t do
something like that without first

clearing it.

RAY KROC
Why would I need to do that?

DICK MCDONALD
Why? Because as your deal plainly states, any and all changes must——

RAY KROC
It’s not a change.

DICK MCDONALD
Excuse me?

RAY KROC
It’s not a change. It’s a company. Its own separate company. Which puts it outside of your purview.
 
91.


DICK MCDONALD
Anything relating to McDonald’s is within our--

RAY KROC
You boys have full say over what goes on inside the restaurants. But outside? Above? Below?... Your authority stops at the door. And the floor.

ON MAC-- standing in the doorway, sick to his stomach. He can’t hear what Kroc is saying, but he knows it’s not good.

INT. KROC’S OFFICE - ANOTHER DAY

Kroc is leaning against his desk, arms folded confidently, a big grin on his face. It’s a slightly weird sight until we hear the click of a camera and realize it’s a PHOTO SHOOT.

PHOTOGRAPHER
Let’s try a few by the map.

The PHOTOGRAPHER leads Kroc to the expansion map, which is significantly more crowded with pins now. Kroc strikes the same pose, arms winningly crossed.

PHOTOGRAPHER (CONT’D)
Good, good.

Kroc impulsively grabs a prop hamburger off the desk, holds it up for the camera.

PHOTOGRAPHER (CONT’D)
Love it.

Kroc playfully pretends to take a big bite.

PHOTOGRAPHER (CONT’D)
(snapping away)

That’s a riot!


INT. MCDONALD’S (ROLLIE SMITH) - DAY

Rollie is hustling about the kitchen, supervising the lunch rush.

MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
(gruff)

Delivery.
 
92.


He turns, expecting to see a delivery man. Instead, Ray Kroc is standing there, leaning against THREE BOXES on a dolly.

RAY KROC
(like a delivery guy)

Where ya want these?


INT. BACK OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

Kroc looks on as Rollie opens one of the boxes, unsure what’s inside.

ANGLE ON box’s contents: hundreds of silver-foil packets.

ROLLIE SMITH
(excited, surprised)

Yeah?

RAY KROC
I’ve thought it over.

ON JOAN-- also there, anxiously awaiting Kroc’s next words.

RAY KROC (CONT’D)
Approved.

JOAN SMITH
Really? Oh, thank you!

RAY KROC
Thank you. It’s a whiz-bang idea.

And you thought of it.

Kroc revels in the feeling of playing kingmaker.

ROLLIE SMITH
Well, we’re deeply honored to serve as your test market.

RAY KROC
To heck with that. I’m rolling it

out nationally.

Joan gasps, honored, thrilled. Her idea, implemented across the country.

ON ROLLIE-- looking at Joan looking at Ray. We finally detect the first stirrings of jealousy.

RAY KROC (CONT’D)
Speaking of Inst-A-Mix, have you

seen the new issue of “RBM”?
 
93.


Kroc reaches inside his coat, pulls out a copy of “Restaurant Business Monthly”. Hands it to Rollie.

RAY KROC (CONT’D)
Hot off the press.

ON ROLLIE-- taking in the cover...

ANGLE ON magazine. Kroc is the cover boy. A big photo of him in his office, smiling, holding the hamburger. The headline:

MCDONALD’S TAKES A BITE OUT OF THE COMPETITION - UPSTART HAMBURGER EMPORIUM IS ‘ON THE GROW’

ON JOAN-- looking at Ray on the cover. Looking at Ray in the flesh.


INT. KROC’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Ethel is asleep in bed, alone.


LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Kroc is on the phone, speaking quietly.

RAY KROC
(intrigued)

Bloomington...


INT. ROLLIE AND JOAN SMITH’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Joan is on the kitchen phone, also speaking softly. She’s wearing a nightie.

JOAN SMITH
It’s about 10 miles south of downtown. They’re building a brand-new sports stadium there.

RAY KROC
I read about that.

JOAN SMITH
We’re getting a professional baseball and football team. They’ll both be playing there.

RAY KROC
I think I see where you’re going

with this...
 
94.


JOAN SMITH
A 40,000-seat stadium, just a
stone’s throw away. Imagine the

foot traffic.

RAY KROC
Hungry families looking for a bite after the ballgame.

JOAN SMITH
Or before. Whenever.

RAY KROC
I like the way you think, Joan.

You think big.

JOAN SMITH
Is there any other way to?

RAY KROC
You’d be surprised.

His gaze drifts downward. To his wedding ring.

RAY KROC (CONT’D)
A lot of people, they’re scared. Of taking a chance. Reaching for greatness.

JOAN SMITH
That’s so sad.

RAY KROC
I agree. Ambition, that’s the stuff of life.

JOAN SMITH
What’s that saying? “Fortune favors the bold.”

RAY KROC
Absolutely.

JOAN SMITH
Just look at you.

RAY KROC
Are you calling me bold, Joan?

JOAN SMITH
You don’t build a restaurant empire acting like a timid little mouse.
 
95.


BEDROOM - SHORT TIME LATER

Kroc lies in bed next to Ethel. His hands drift downward under the covers, toward his nether regions.


INT. KROC’S OFFICE - DAY

Kroc, Harry Sonneborn and Fred Turner stand huddled over a map of Texas.

HARRY SONNEBORN
(re: some city on map)

That’s a fast-growing area.

The phone rings outside the room.

HARRY SONNEBORN (CONT’D) And cheaper. You’re talking a good 15 percent less per acre.

RAY KROC
I still say Houston’s the move.

JUNE MARTINO (O.S.)
Sir?

June Martino is standing in the doorway.

JUNE MARTINO (CONT’D)
Dick on line one.


INT. MCDONALD’S - SAN BERNARDINO - CONTINUOUS

Dick on the phone in his office, Mac in the background.

DICK MCDONALD
I just got a very disconcerting

call.

Kroc on the other end--Harry, Fred and June listening in.
Kroc has a smug, cocky air, “playing to the crowd” a bit.

RAY KROC
Oh?

DICK MCDONALD
From Buddy Jepsen. Our operator in

Sacramento.

RAY KROC
I’m well aware who Buddy Jepsen is.
 
96.


DICK MCDONALD
He told me he received a shipment

this morning.

RAY KROC
It arrived?

DICK MCDONALD
You are way out of line, Ray.

RAY KROC
I figured it wouldn’t get there

until Friday the earliest.

DICK MCDONALD
Would you mind telling me what
you’re doing shipping four cases of

Inst-A-Mix to one of our operators?

RAY KROC
If you’re not interested in turning a profit, that’s fine. But please don’t stop the rest of us.

DICK MCDONALD
Us?

RAY KROC
Us. As in everyone but you.

DICK MCDONALD
Who did you send them to?

RAY KROC
Everyone but you.

DICK MCDONALD
You have no right, Ray. You are to stop this instant. Is that clear?

RAY KROC
Nah.

DICK MCDONALD
Excuse me?

RAY KROC
You heard me. Nah.

DICK MCDONALD
What the hell’s that mean?
 
97.


RAY KROC
It means from now on I’ll be doing things my way.

DICK MCDONALD
You will abide by the terms of your deal.

RAY KROC
I’m through taking marching orders
from you. Bowing to your dictates.

You and your endless parade of nos.

DICK MCDONALD
You have a contract.

RAY KROC
Don’t grow, don’t change... Cower

in the face of progress...

DICK MCDONALD
If phony powdered milkshakes is
your idea of progress, you have a
profound misunderstanding of what

McDonald’s is about.

RAY KROC
I have a far better understanding of McDonald’s than you two yokels.

DICK MCDONALD
What did you say?

RAY KROC
You heard me.

DICK MCDONALD
You will do as we say.

RAY KROC
Nope.

DICK MCDONALD
You have a contract.

RAY KROC
Contracts are like hearts. They’re made to be broken.


INT. KROC’S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Kroc and Ethel eat dinner together in edgy silence. All we hear is the sound of knife scraping plate as meat is cut.
 
98.


ETHEL KROC
Please pass the salt.
(he passes it)

Thank you.

RAY KROC
You’re welcome.

Another stretch of silence. Cutting and chewing.

RAY KROC (CONT’D)
I want a divorce.


INT. LAWYER’S OFFICE - DAY

The big, oak-paneled office of a top Chicago law firm. Kroc sits across from a LAWYER.

LAWYER
It’s not so simple.

He looks down at a document in his hand, Kroc’s contract with the brothers.

LAWYER (CONT’D)
This contract, it’s ironclad.

RAY KROC
I don’t care what it takes...

MATCH CUT TO:


INT. ANOTHER LAWYER’S OFFICE - DAY

Virtually the identical scene, except a different office and different LAWYER.

RAY KROC
Just get me out.

LAWYER #2
She’s gonna put up one hell of a

fight.

RAY KROC
She can have it all. The house, the car, the insurance policy...

LAWYER #2
(treading lightly)

What about the...
 
99.


RAY KROC
Never. I’d sooner die than give that woman one share of McDonald’s.


INT. MCDONALD’S (SAN BERNARDINO) - OFFICE - DAY

Dick enters the office. He notices a package on his desk, addressed to him and Mac. He opens it, pulls out a silver-foil Inst-A-Mix packet. It’s stamped “S”.

Dick reaches in, pulls out a handwritten note from Kroc:

NEW FLAVOR... STRAWBERRY. MAYBE YOU’LL LIKE THIS ONE!

--BEST, RAY

His dismay is soon eclipsed by something else:

The note from Kroc; it’s not on Franchise Realty Corporation letterhead. The letterhead says THE MCDONALD’S CORPORATION. It’s signed at the bottom RAYMOND A. KROC - PRESIDENT.


INT. FRANCHISE REALTY CORPORATION - SHORT TIME LATER

Workmen are taking down the Franchise Realty Corporation sign at the front desk, a new one going up in its place: THE MCDONALD’S CORPORATION.

RAY KROC (O.S.)
It was confusing.


INT. KROC’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Kroc on the phone.

RAY KROC
No one knew it had anything to do

with McDonald’s.


INT. SAN BERNARDINO - CONTINUOUS

Dick on the other end. Mac there, too.

DICK MCDONALD
What’s confusing is you calling
yourself the McDonald’s

Corporation.

ON MAC-- listening, strangely calm.
 
100.


DICK MCDONALD (CONT’D)
People will think it’s the whole
company, not just the real-estate
arm. Which I strongly suspect is

what you hope.

Without warning, Mac SNATCHES THE PHONE out of Dick’s hands--

MAC MCDONALD
IT’S NOT YOUR COMPANY, RAY!

RAY KROC
Mac.

MAC MCDONALD
Do you understand that?

RAY KROC
Don’t get all bent out of shape.

MAC MCDONALD
We came up with the Speedee System, not you. Us. What did you ever come up with, Ray? Name one thing. You can’t. Because you never have and you never will. You’re a leech! You’re a professional leech!

ON DICK-- stunned by his brother’s outburst.

RAY KROC
Would you like to know what I came up with? I’ll tell you, Mac. I came up with a concept. A highly novel concept called winning. You boys are content to sit back and be a couple of also-rans. To let the future run roughshod over you. Me, I want to take the future. I want to win. And you don’t get there by being some aw-shucks, nice-guy sap. There’s no place in business for people like that. Business is war. It’s rat eat rat, dog eat dog. If my competitor was drowning, I’d reach out and stick a goddamn hose in his mouth. Can you say the same?

MAC MCDONALD
I can’t, nor would I want to.

RAY KROC
Hence your single location.
 
101.


MAC MCDONALD
I want you out of this company.

RAY KROC
And how do you propose to do that?

MAC MCDONALD
Whatever it takes. We’ll sue you if necessary.

RAY KROC
You couldn’t afford to sue me. I could bury you in court costs alone. I’m the president and CEO of a major corporation with landholdings in 17 states. You run a burger stand in the desert.
(blistering, nuclear)
I’m national. You’re fucking local.

Kroc hears a loud THUD through the phone.

Mac has COLLAPSED to the floor.

The wail of an AMBULANCE SIREN carries us to--


INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

Mac lies in a hospital bed looking pale and weak. Dick stands by as DR. REEVES talks to Mac.

DR. REEVES
You’ve been following your eating
plan?
(Mac nods)
Checking your glucose levels?
(Mac nods)
Taking your medication on a
consistent basis?
(Mac nods)
Regular walks, 20 minutes a day?
(Mac nods)
No smoking?
(Mac nods)
Any stress?

MAC MCDONALD
(BEAT, understatement of
century)

Some.
 
102.


DR. REEVES
You need to watch that. It’s a big contributing factor.

The doctor flips to a page in Mac’s chart.

DR. REEVES (CONT’D)
As I said, your kidney function’s currently at 50 percent. 18 months ago, it was 65. Any lower, you’re at serious risk for kidney failure.


INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

Mac is doing a crossword puzzle, Dick in a chair nearby.

MAC MCDONALD
“William Who Rode With Paul

Revere.”

DICK MCDONALD
How many letters?

MAC MCDONALD
Five, fourth letter E.

DICK MCDONALD
Dawes.

Mac pencils it in. A knock at the door.

MAC MCDONALD
Come in.

Mac and Dick look toward the door, stunned to see...

Ray Kroc, holding a bouquet of flowers.

RAY KROC
How ya feelin’?

The brothers glare at their unexpected, unwelcome guest.

RAY KROC (CONT’D)
That was some spill. Felt it all

the way through the phone.

Kroc extends the flowers to Mac.

RAY KROC (CONT’D)
For you.
 
103.


Mac takes the flowers like they’re potentially laced with anthrax. He glances at the card attached.

RAY KROC (CONT’D)
Open it.

MAC MCDONALD
That’s alright.

RAY KROC
Please. I think you’ll like it.

Mac reaches in the envelope, pulls out a GET-WELL CARD. He opens the card. A CHECK falls out. Blank.

MAC MCDONALD
What’s this?

RAY KROC
What’s it look like?

MAC MCDONALD
It looks like a blank check.

RAY KROC
Then that’s probably what it is.

Mac and Dick look at each other.

RAY KROC (CONT’D)
How much should I make it out for?

MAC MCDONALD
What are you buying?

Kroc flashes them a “You don’t know?” smirk.


INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

Mac and Dick both gazing off gloomily. After a long stretch of silence--

MAC MCDONALD
We’ll never beat him.
(BEAT)

We’ll never be rid of him.

ON DICK-- absorbing. He knows Mac is right.
 
104.


INT. KROC’S OFFICE - DAY

Kroc is standing before the franchise map. There are nearly 50 PINS in it now. The intercom buzzes.

JUNE MARTINO (O.S.)
Dick McDonald.

Kroc picks up, friendly and casual.

RAY KROC
Hiya, Dick.

On the other end is Dick, in the KITCHEN in San Bernardino.

DICK MCDONALD
$2.7 million.
(BEAT)
A million for each of us after

taxes.

ON KROC-- taken aback by the staggering sum.

DICK MCDONALD (CONT’D)
And one percent of the company’s

profits in perpetuity.


INT. KROC’S OFFICE - DAY

Kroc is pacing furiously before Harry Sonneborn.

RAY KROC
It’s outrageous! Borderline

extortion!

Sonneborn is holding a document. A PURCHASE PROPOSAL from the brothers.

HARRY SONNEBORN
And they want one other thing.

RAY KROC
What?

HARRY SONNEBORN
San Bernardino.

Kroc is taken aback.

HARRY SONNEBORN (CONT’D)
To give to their longtime

employees. As a gift.
 
105.


RAY KROC
I need San Bernardino. I was
counting on its profits to cover

the debt on the purchase loan.

HARRY SONNEBORN
I’ve spoken at length about it with their lawyers. It’s unfortunately non-negotiable.

ON KROC-- calmly absorbing.


INT. LAW OFFICE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

Kroc and the brothers in a conference room, flanked by their respective teams of LAWYERS.

KROC LAWYER
Our client agrees fully to your conditions of sale. With one exception. Your one percent cut of future corporate earnings will have to be carried out on a handshake basis.

RAY KROC
On the insistence of my investor group. Their financing is contingent on leaving it out of the contract. It’s unfortunately a dealbreaker for them.

Dick and Mac look at each other, extremely wary.

RAY KROC (CONT’D)
You have my word you’ll get your

full due royalties.

He extends his hand, holding it out to them.


CONFERENCE ROOM - SHORT TIME LATER

Mac and Dick sit alone in the conference room as their lawyers pack up. (Kroc and his team are gone.)

ON MAC-- staring somberly at a check in his hands for $1,350,000.

ON DICK-- staring somberly at a check in his hands for $1,350,000.
 
106.


INT. MEN’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Kroc is at the urinal in the law office’s men’s room. He flushes, heads to the sink to wash his hands.

The rest room door opens. In walks Dick. He freezes at the sight of Kroc. Kroc smiles amiably at him in the mirror.

RAY KROC
Hello, Dick.

ON DICK-- gazing searchingly at Kroc.

DICK MCDONALD
I just have to ask you one thing.

Something I’ve never understood.

RAY KROC
Alright.

DICK MCDONALD
That day we met, when we gave you

the tour.

RAY KROC
What about it?

DICK MCDONALD
We showed you everything. The whole system, all our secrets. We were an open book.
(Kroc nods)

So why didn’t you just--

RAY KROC
Rip you off? Run off and start my
own place using your ideas?
(Dick nods)

Because it would have failed.

DICK MCDONALD
How do you know?

RAY KROC
Am I the only one who ever got the kitchen tour? I bet you invited loads of people back there. Countless would-be burger barons looking to replicate your success.

DICK MCDONALD
And?
 
107.


RAY KROC
How many succeeded?

DICK MCDONALD
Lots of people started restaurants.

RAY KROC
Bigger than McDonald’s?
(Dick is silent)
Of course not. No one has and no
one ever will. Because they all
lack that one thing that makes
McDonald’s special.

DICK MCDONALD
Which is...

RAY KROC
Even you don’t know!

DICK MCDONALD
Enlighten me.

RAY KROC
It’s not just the system. It’s the name.

Dick doesn’t follow.

RAY KROC (CONT’D)
That name. That glorious name.
McDonald. It’s wide open.
Limitless. It could be anything,
whatever you want it to be. It
sounds like... America.
(BEAT)
Compare that to, oh, say, Kroc. Now there’s a real lemon. Kroc. What a crock. Load of crock. Crock of shit. Would you eat at a place called Kroc’s? It’s enough to make you lose your appetite, a blunt, Slavic thing like that. But McDonald’s, now that’s a name. A fine, handsome, all-American name. That’s a winner’s name, the name of somebody who’s got the world by the tail. A man named McDonald is never going to get pushed around in life.

DICK MCDONALD
That’s clearly not the case.
 
108.


RAY KROC
So you don’t have a check for $1.35 million in your pocket?

Dick is silenced.

RAY KROC (CONT’D)
That’s the mistake your competitors made. All those would-be imitators. They assumed they could simply take your system, slap on some name like Hamburger Hamlet or Roscoe’s, and presto! Instant success! Not me, I wasn’t so arrogant. I knew there’s no beating a name like McDonald’s.

DICK MCDONALD
And if you can’t beat ‘em...

RAY KROC
Buy ‘em.

Dick chuckles in disgust.

RAY KROC (CONT’D)
I’ll never forget the first time I saw that name stretched across the front of your stand. It was love at first sight. From that moment, I knew I just had to have it. And now I do.

DICK MCDONALD
You don’t “have” it.

RAY KROC
You sure about that?

Kroc throws him an unnerving smile.


EXT. MCDONALD’S (SAN BERNARDINO) - DAY

ANGLE ON the McDonald’s sign in front of the restaurant.

PAN DOWN TO... Dick and Mac with Kroc’s lawyers, listening like they’re being read their Miranda rights.
 
109.


KROC LAWYER
As per the terms of your agreement, while you are entitled to maintain ownership of this location, you no longer have the right to call it McDonald’s, McDonald or any other such variation so as to create confusion or infringe upon the McDonald’s trademark which is now the exclusive intellectual property of Mr. Raymond A. Kroc.

DISSOLVE TO:

Workers dismantling the McDonald’s sign. The brothers watch helplessly as their name is removed from their own store.

DISSOLVE TO:

A new sign going up in its place. With a new name--

THE BIG M

Below this, it says, with a whiff of desperation:

“WE HAVE BEEN HERE 23 YEARS!”

The sign is as close to a McDonald’s marquee as is legally possible, but it’s just not McDonald’s. It’s heartbreaking.

PAN ACROSS THE STREET, where we see...

A NEW MCDONALD’S under construction. A hard-hatted Kroc is on site, watching as the signature Golden Arches go up.

YOUNG MAN (O.S.)
Mr. Kroc?

A YOUNG MAN comes over, slightly nervous to approach.

YOUNG MAN (CONT’D) My name is Will Davis. I’m a reporter for the Los Angeles Times. I’m interested in doing a profile of you pegged to the opening of your hundredth location here.

A BEAT as Kroc thinks it over.

RAY KROC
Call my office. They’ll set it up.

He reaches into the breast pocket of his sport coat.
 
110.


RAY KROC (CONT’D)
Here’s my card.

He hands a BUSINESS CARD to the reporter. He looks at it.

ANGLE ON card. Beneath a McDonald’s logo, it says, simply:

RAY KROC – FOUNDER

We hold on this for a long BEAT.

RAY KROC (PRE-LAP)
Now, I know what you’re thinking...


EXT. BEVERLY HILLS MANSION - DAY

A lavish, gated MANSION. A BLACK LIMOUSINE pulls into the driveway.


INT. MANSION - MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

A tuxedo-clad Ray Kroc stands before a mirror, stack of index cards in hand. He’s 68 now; it’s nine years later, 1970.

RAY KROC
How the heck does an over-the-hill 52-year-old milkshake-machine salesman build a fast-food empire with 1,600 restaurants in 50 states and five foreign countries, with annual revenues in the neighborhood of $700 million? It’s quite simple: persistence.

He turns to the next card.

RAY KROC (CONT’D)
Nothing in the world can take the
place of good old persistence.
Talent won’t. Nothing’s more common
than unsuccessful men with talent.
Genius won’t. Unrecognized genius
is practically a cliché.

His words have a familiar ring... They’re lifted straight from “The Power Of The Positive” by Dr. Clarence Floyd Nelson (the record from the beginning of the movie), with just a bit of rephrasing to make it “his own”.

RAY KROC (CONT’D) Education won’t. The world is full of educated fools.

(MORE)
 
111.

RAY KROC (CONT’D)
Persistence and determination alone

are all-powerful.

He pauses a beat to let his words of wisdom sink in.

RAY KROC (CONT’D)
There’s no obstacle under the sun
that can’t be overcome with honest
hard work and determination. It’s
these core principles that enabled
me to rise to the top of the heap
at a point in life when most men
would be thinking about retirement.
(glances to side, sly
grin)
We appear to have that in common,

Mr. Governor.

He pauses for laughter.

RAY KROC (CONT’D)
You were, what, 55 when you started in politics? Why, you make me look like a spring chicken!

Another pause for laughter.

RAY KROC (CONT’D)
Look at us, a couple of small-town
Illinois boys made good. Only in

America...

He continues talking to Mr. Governor off to the side--

RAY KROC (CONT’D) By the way, thank you for that splendid introduction. To be named California Chamber of Commerce Man of The Year is thrill enough, but to be presented the award by my dear friend and golf buddy Ronald Reagan, well, that’s just the cherry on the sundae.

He turns to the next index card.

RAY KROC (CONT’D) Now where was I? Ah, yes, the beginning. The year was 1954. The place, Des Plaines, Illinois. That’s where it all started. Right there on Lee Street--
 
112.


JOAN KROC (O.S.)
The car’s out front.

Joan Smith, now Joan Kroc, comes up behind him.

RAY KROC
(to her reflection)

Be right down.

She nods, exits the room.

Kroc looks down at the card in his hand, finding his place:

IT ALL STARTED. RIGHT THERE ON LEE STREET... MCDONALD’S #1

RAY KROC (CONT’D)
--McDonald’s #1.

Kroc’s eyes linger on those words on the card: MCDONALD’S #1.

He looks up, stares at himself in the mirror for a long BEAT.

As he takes in his reflection, we detect a flicker of something on his face. Regret? Guilt?...

It may have just been our imagination.

He tucks the index cards in his pocket, stands up.


INT. LIMOUSINE - MOMENTS LATER

Kroc and Joan Smith (now JOAN KROC) ride in the back of a stretch limo. She’s in a powder-blue gown, draped in diamonds and pearls.

LIMO DRIVER
Comfortable, Mr. Kroc?

An air conditioning vent blows cool air on Kroc.

RAY KROC
Oh, yes.
(placid)

Very.

CAMERA slowly pushes in on Kroc’s face as he rides in silence. He looks at Joan, smiles.

He indeed seems comfortable. Very.
