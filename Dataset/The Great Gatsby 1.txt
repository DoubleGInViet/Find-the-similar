A BLACK SCREEN.
The blackness is pierced by a single, pulsing green light... 
We drift, as if by boat, across a dark bay toward the light.
Then, we hear a troubled voice.
NICK (V.O.)
In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice: “always try to see the best in people,” he would say... 
A gentle snow begins to fall, obscuring the light... 
NICK (V.O.)
As a consequence, I’m inclined to
reserve all judgements.
The snow grows heavier.
NICK (V.O.)
But even I...  have a limit.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. SANITARIUM - WINTER - DAY
Continue drifting, through the snow, across an icy lake... 
NICK (V.O.)
Back then all of us drank too much.
DISCOVER: A stately Victorian building... 
NICK (V.O.)
The more in tune with the times we were, the more we drank.
CLOSE ON: The sign, “The Perkins Sanitarium.”
NICK (V.O.)
And none of us contributed anything new.

NICK
When I came back from New York I
was disgusted.
REVEAL: NICK CARRAWAY (37), unshaven, morbidly alcoholic.
NICK (CONT’D)
Disgusted...  with everyone, and
everything...  Only one man was
exempt from my disgust.
REVEAL: A kind, elderly DOCTOR.
DOCTOR
One man... ? Mr. Carraway?
NICK
(whispers)
Gatsby... 
DOCTOR
Was he a friend of yours?
NICK
He was...  the single most hopeful
person I have ever met...  And am
ever likely to meet again. There
was something about him... 
Nick wanders slowly towards the window, remembering.
NICK (CONT’D)
A sensitivity. He was like one of
those machines that register
earthquakes ten thousand miles
away... 
DOCTOR
Where did you meet him?
Nick stops and stares out the window, haunted.
NICK
At a party. In New York.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. NEW YORK CITY - DAY
THROUGH THE CLOUDS: New skyscrapers pierce a clear blue sky.
3.
NICK (V.O.)
In the summer of 1922, the tempo of the city approached hysteria... 
ON WALL STREET: A fever pitch of buying and selling... 
NICL (V.O.)
Stocks hit record peaks. And Wall
Street boomed, in a steady golden
roar... 
IMAGES OF DECADENT NEW YORK FADE IN, ILLUSTRATING NICK’S V.O. Dancing girls, speakeasies, bootleg kings, fat cats counting fresh fortunes, and the stock market climbing up, up, up... !
NICK (V.O.)
The parties were bigger; the shows were broader; the buildings were higher; the morals were looser; and the ban on alcohol had backfired...  making the liquor cheaper.
FADE IN: A sea of boater hats crowds a Manhattan street.
NICK (V.O.)
Wall Street was luring the young
and ambitious.
PUSH TOWARD: One of the hats. Its wearer stops, and gazes up.
NICK (V.O.)
And I was one of them.
REVEAL: A clear-eyed, hopeful, 29 year old Nick Carraway.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. LONG ISLAND - WEST EGG - DAY
AERIAL: The city is still visible in the distance...

INT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - DAY
Nick is unpacking... 
NICK (V.O.)
To get started, I bought a dozen
volumes on credit, banking and
investments--
CLOSE ON: A row of heavy red and gold-bound bonds books. Nick plucks one up.
NICK (V.O.)
All new to me... 
And turns on the radio.

INT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - DAY
Nick, still unpacking, eyes a mountain of unpacked books... 
NICK (V.O.)
At Yale, I’d dreamed of being a
writer.
He resists the temptation to swap bonds books for literature.
NICK (V.O.)
But I gave all that up.
EXT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - PORCH - DAY
Nick emerges onto the porch, greeted by dazzling sunshine.
NICK (V.O.)
With the sun shining and the great bursts of leaves on the trees, I planned to spend the summer studying.
Nick sits and places his bonds book in front of him... 
NICK (V.O.)
And I probably would have--
When woman’s shriek startles him... 
NICK’S POV: On the neighboring beach a group of revellers are frolicking. A scantily girl clad waves and then disappears into the trees, drawing Nick’s eye to his neighbor’s house... 
NICK (V.O.)
Were it not for the riotous
amusements that beckoned from
beyond the walls of that colossal
castle... 
Through dense foliage Nick spies the mysterious spires and towers of the neighboring Gothic folly.

So...  He was your neighbor?

My neighbor? No, Gatsby was-- Well-- If I think about it...  The history of the summer really began the night I drove over to my cousin Daisy’s for dinner... 
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - LATE AFTERNOON
HIGH AND WIDE: Nick’s old Dodge disappears down the drive... 
NICK (V.O.)
She lived across the bay... 
SWOOP ACROSS THE BAY TOWARDS... 
EXT. BUCHANAN MANSION - LATE AFTERNOON
An impressive Georgian mansion overlooks a quarter mile of lawn that cascades down to a private polo field.
NICK (V.O.)
In old money East Egg.
BRINNNGGG! BRINNNGGG! We hear a phone ringing off-screen.
FOLLOW: A polo player (TOM), as he gallops toward the house.
NICK (V.O.)
Her husband was heir to one of
America’s wealthiest families.
BRINNNGGG! BRINNNGGG!
Tom whacks the polo ball... 
NICK (V.O.)
His name was Tom Buchanan.
7.
The ball nearly hits one of Tom’s gardeners... 
NICK (V.O.)
When we were at Yale together he’d been a sporting star.
BRINNNGGG! BRINNNGGG!
Tom dismounts and bounds up the stairs to the porch... 
NICK (V.O.)
But now his glory days were behind him and he contented himself with...  other affairs.
Tom aggressively grabs the telephone from HENRI, the butler, and turns; revealing an imposing, hard-mouthed man of thirty.
TOM (INTO PHONE)
I thought I told you not to call me here... !
PULL FOCUS: Tom sees a servant escort Nick along the balcony.
Clunking down the receiver, Tom strides toward Nick and grasps his hand with overbearing strength.
TOM (CONT’D)
Shakespeare! How’s the great
American novel coming... ?
NICK
Oh, I’m selling bonds now Tom... 
with Walter Chase’s outfit--
TOM
Never heard of em.
Tom slaps Nick with irritating heartiness!
TOM (CONT’D)
Hey! What say after dinner we go
into town?
NICK
Can’t--
TOM
Catch up with the old wolf pack?
NICK
Big day on the new job tomorrow--
8.
TOM
Nonsense! We’re going.
INT. BUCHANAN MANSION - HALL OF CHAMPIONS - LATE AFTERNOON
Tom leads Nick down a grand hall lined with the trophies that chronicle Tom’s infinite sporting achievements.
TOM
First team, all-American!
Tom admires his own achievements.
TOM (CONT’D)
You see? Made me who I am today.
Tom pulls his favorite trophy from the cabinet--
TOM (CONT’D)
Here-- Forest Hills...  I played the
Prince of Wales. What a sissy!
Tom exchanges the trophy for a football.
TOM (CONT’D)
Life’s something you dominate Nick.
He pelts Nick with the ball--
TOM (CONT’D)
If you’re any good.
Nick fumbles as Tom charges him--
TOM (CONT’D)
Ha-ha-ha!
Tom tackles Nick, knocking him back, through a pair of vaulting doors, and into... 
INT. BUCHANAN MANSION - SALON - LATE AFTERNOON
A shimmering, sun-dazzled room in which enormous white curtains whip and snap in the breeze... 
CLOSE ON: Nick, frozen, awestruck.
We hear the giggle of naughty children... 
BOOM!!! As the French doors shut, and the curtains fall, a beautiful white hand rises from behind the couch, and with it, a low, thrilling voice... 
9.
DAISY (O.S.)
Oh Nicky...  Is that you my lovely?
Suddenly, 23 year old DAISY BUCHANAN, appears from over the back of the couch. Her bright eyes and passionate mouth are framed by a strawberry-blonde bob.
CLOSE ON: Daisy, captivating... 
NICK (V.O.)
Daisy Buchanan. The golden girl. A breathless warmth flowed from her. A promise that there was no one else in the world she so wanted to see... 
She whispers dramatically... 
DAISY
Do they miss me in Chicago?
NICK
Oh, yes. About a dozen people send their love.
DAISY
(unimpressed)
How gorgeous.
NICK
They’re absolutely in mourning... 
They’re crying... 
DAISY
No--
NICK
They’re wailing... 
DAISY
No--
NICK
They’re screaming, they’re
shouting... 
DAISY
No--
NICK
“Daisy Buchanan, we can’t live
without you!”
10.
DAISY
I'm p-paralyzed with happiness... !
Daisy takes Nick’s hand and squeals with childish glee as she drags him over the sofa and onto his back on the floor.
He stares up...  And, a mysterious, athletic girl glares back.
This is 22 year old, JORDAN BAKER.
DAISY (CONT’D)
Jordan Baker; a very famous golfer.
CLOSE ON: Nick, the blood drains from his face... 
NICK (V.O.)
She was the most frightening person
I’d ever seen--
Nick rights himself and extends his hand.
NICK
I’ve seen your face on the cover of “Sporting Life”. Nick Carraway... 
But Jordan merely yawns and stands (we get a good look).
NICK (V.O.)
But I enjoyed looking at her.
JORDAN
I've been lying on that sofa for as long as I can remember... 
Daisy turns to Nick with scandalous delight.
DAISY
I know! This summer I'll sort of,
fling you and Jordan together... 
As Tom prepares drinks at the bar, he glances skittishly at a white telephone set ostentatiously upon a marble pedestal.
DAISY (CONT’D)
I’ll push you into linen closets,
and out to sea in boats... 
JORDAN
I’m not listening to a word!
Irritated, Tom turns to Nick.
TOM
Nick, Daisy tells me you’re over at
West Egg;

11.
TOM (CONT'D)
throwing your lot in with those
social-climbing, primitive New
Money types... ?
NICK
Well, my little shack is cardboard box at eighty a month.
DAISY
Your life is adorable.
Jordan toys with a golf club, and speaks with bored contempt.
JORDAN
I know somebody in West Egg.
NICK
I don't know a single--
Jordan turns dramatically.
JORDAN
Oh, you must know Gatsby.
Daisy, a sharp intake of breath.
DAISY
Gatsby?
CLOSE ON: Daisy, as she struggles to control rising emotion.
DAISY (CONT’D)
What Gatsby... ?
Before anyone can reply, Henri announces--
HENRI
Madame, le diner est servi!
As Jordan WHACKS a golf ball into a makeshift cup - a trophy on the floor - waiters sweep open the doors and the curtains flutter up again.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. BUCHANAN MANSION - TERRACE - NIGHT
Daisy, Nick, Jordan and Tom sit at a long, sumptuously laid table. Food, wine, laughter, smoking... 
DISSOLVING ABSTRACTLY: Through fragments of conversation... 
12.
DAISY
Would you like to hear a family
secret? Its about the butler’s
nose... 
JORDAN
Things went from bad to worse... 
DAISY
Nicky...  I heard a rumor, that you were getting married to a girl out west... 
NICK
Its a libel, I’m too poor.
JORDAN
They have to be old so they die
quickly... 
NICK
Can’t we talk about something else? Anything? Crops? You’re making me feel uncivilized Daisy--
This draws a strangely violent interjection from Tom.
TOM
Civilization's going to pieces!
Have you read 'The Rise of the
Colored Empires' by this fellow
Goddard?
NICK
Why no... 
Tom stands and begins to pace--
TOM
Everyone ought to read it. The idea is that its up to us, the dominant race, to watch out, or these other races... 
Tom straightens the bow-tie on his black servant--
TOM (CONT’D)
Will have control of things.
DAISY
(wickedly)
Tom’s been very profound lately. He reads deep books with long words in them
13.
TOM
It’s been proved. Its scientific.
DAISY
(subtly mocking Tom)
We’ve got to beat them down.
SUDDENLY, BRINNNGGG! The telephone. All freeze. Another ring. BRINNNGGG!
TOM
Excuse me...  I’ll be right back.
He goes inside.
An embarrassed moment; suddenly Daisy throws her napkin down.
DAISY
I’m sorry... 
She follows Tom into the house.
Nick, at a loss, turns to Jordan.
NICK
Well, this Mr. Gatsby you spoke of is my neighbor... 
JORDAN
Shhhh...  Don’t talk. I want to hear what happens.
A subdued, impassioned murmur is audible in the room beyond.
NICK
Is something happening?
JORDAN
I thought everybody knew.
NICK
I don’t.
JORDAN
Tom's got some woman in New York.
NICK
Got some woman?
JORDAN
She might have the decency not to
telephone at dinner-time...  Don’t
you think?
14.
Almost before Nick has grasped her meaning, the doors bang open and Tom and Daisy return to the table.
DAISY
(a tense gayety)
I just love seeing you at my table Nicky. You remind me of a rose, an absolute rose...  Doesn’t he?
NICK
I’m not even faintly like a rose--
TOM
So...  After dinner Nick wanted to
go into town. Right Nick? To the
Yale club.
DAISY
Nicky, stay--
NICK
I have to work early.
TOM
Nonsense. Its only for a drink or
two.
Daisy and Tom stare at Nick - both demanding his allegiance.
SUDDENLY! The telephone rings again: BRINNNGGG! Again, all freeze. BRINNNGGG!
PUSH IN: On Daisy as the telephone continues to shriek.
NICK (V.O.)
None of us could ignore that fifth guest’s shrill metallic urgency... 
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. BUCHANAN MANSION - BALUSTRADE - LATER
Servants clear. Jordan and Tom retire to the salon, as Nick and Daisy stroll down toward the water, and Daisy confides:
DAISY
Oh Nicky... 
NICK
What?
15.
DAISY
Its just, well, you see, I think everything’s terrible anyhow. You know I’ve been everywhere and seen everything and done everything, and I’ve had very bad time Nicky...  I’m pretty cyncical about everything.
Daisy gazes melancholic across the bay; an awkward silence.
Nick tries to change the subject--
NICK
Your daughter; I suppose she talks, and...  eats, and everything?
DAISY
Pammy? Oh yes... 
Daisy leans on a stone balustrade and gazes down toward the dock, where a green light glows in the velvet dusk.
DAISY (CONT’D)
Listen Nick, when she was born, Tom was God knows where - with God knows whom - and I asked the nurse if it was a boy or a girl. She told me it was a girl, and I wept. 'All right,' I said, 'I'm glad it's a girl. And I hope she'll be a fool - that's the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool.’
She breaks off, and looks at Nick with that smile of hers... 
DAISY (CONT’D)
All the bright precious things fade so fast... 
And as a sad, sweet underscore plays, WE PUSH out over the water, and across the bay toward Gatsby’s castle... 
DAISY (CONT’D)
And they don’t come back.
EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - DOCK - NIGHT
WE DISCOVER: At the end of Gatsby’s dock, A MAN - his dark silhouette is cut against the paler black of the night sky.
In the distance behind him we see headlights. It is Nick, pulling up at his bungalow.
16.
EXT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - NIGHT
Nick gets out of his car. He stops. Through the trees, he can see The Man gazing intently across the bay.
NICK (V.O.)
When I arrived home I noticed that a figure had emerged on my neighbor’s dock.
Nick goes closer, and watches The Man... 
NICK (V.O.)
And something told me it was...  Mr.
Gatsby.
The Man reaches out--
NICK (V.O.)
He seemed to be...  reaching toward something out there in the dark.
A green light on dock pulses in the distant darkness... 
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. SANITARIUM - DOCTOR’S OFFICE - WINTER - NIGHT
Nick, troubled... 
NICK
The green light.
DOCTOR
Green light?
Nick struggles with a painful memory... 
NICK
I don’t want to talk about this
Doctor.
Nick breaks off; and after a VERY LONG SILENCE, he admits:
NICK (CONT’D)
I can’t talk about THIS.
DOCTOR
(delicately)
Then write about it.
17.
NICK
(skeptical)
Write?
DOCTOR
Yes. Write.
NICK
Why would I do that?
DOCTOR
After all, you said that writing
brought you solace, once upon a
time.
NICK
Yeah, well. It didn’t bring anyone else much solace...  I wasn’t any good.
The Doctor offers Nick a pen; but Nick does not accept.
DOCTOR
No one need ever read it. You can
always burn it.
NICK
What would I write about?
DOCTOR
Anything. Whatever you can’t quite talk about; a memory; a thought; a place...  Write it down.
CLOSE ON: Nick considering the challenge... 
NICK
(to himself)
A place... 
Slowly he takes the pen.
We hear the clatter of metal wheels on train tracks; AS THE SCREEN FILLS WITH WORDS, we hear them as voice-over.
NICK (V.O.)
The Valley of Ashes was a grotesque place... 
18.
EXT. THE VALLEY OF ASHES - DAY
HIGH AND WIDE: A vast dumping ground comprised of massive mounds of smoldering ash; train tracks cut through its heart and the gleaming towers of the city shimmer in the distance.
NICK (V.O.)
New York’s dumping ground, half way between West Egg and the city... 
IMAGES illustrate the poverty and hopelessness of life here.
NICK (V.O.)
... Where the burnt out coal that powered the booming, golden city was discarded by men who moved dimly and already crumbling through the powdery air.
A train waits at a drawbridge spanning a small, foul creek.
DISCOVER: Nick, aboard the train, looking out at the awful wasteland... 
NICK (V.O.)
... This fantastic farm was ever-
watched by Dr. T. J. Eckleberg... 
NICK’S POV: A gigantic paint peeling billboard reads: “Dr. T.J. Eckleberg.”
NICK (V.O.)
... A forgotten oculist whose eyes
brooded over it all like the eyes
of God.
INT. TRAIN - DAY
Tom, flushed with booze and heat, glances covertly around the halted carriage. Nick sits opposite.
NICK (V.O.)
Tom had invited me to town, on the pretense of a lunch at the Yale Club... .
As the carriage moves, Tom suddenly pulls Nick to his feet.
NICK (V.O.)
But the day took an unexpected
turn... 
Tom drags Nick from the moving train.
19.
TOM
Come on--!
EXT. THE VALLEY OF ASHES - DAY
As the train pulls off, Nick, exasperates, chases Tom.
NICK (O.S.)
What are we doing?
TOM
Trust me!
NICK
Wait a second would you!?
TOM

Dominate Nick! Dominate!
PAN DOWN TO DISCOVER: Tom and Nick outside a small garage.
A sign reads: “GEORGE B. WILSON. Cars Bought and Sold.”
INT. WILSON’S GARAGE - CONTINUOUS
As Tom and Nick enter the dim garage, WILSON, a nervous, spiritless man, appears from the back office.
TOM
Hello Wilson! How's business?
WILSON
(unconvincing)
I can't complain. When are you
going to sell me that car?
TOM
I've got my man working on it.
WILSON
Works pretty slow, don't he?
TOM
(coldly)
Maybe I'd better sell it somewhere else?
WILSON
I don't mean that, I just... 
20.
Wilson’s grovelling is terminated by the sound of chunky red heels corkscrewing down stairs from above. All turn to see: MYRTLE WILSON. Buxom. Smoldering. Elementally sensual.
MYRTLE
If its business you’re talking, you should be talking to me... 
(to her husband)
Get some chairs why don't you; so
somebody can sit down... 
Myrtle smiles slowly and, walking through her husband as if he were a ghost, shakes hands with Tom.
MYRTLE (CONT’D)
(without turning)
Hurry up!
WILSON
Oh, sure...  Sure... 
Wilson hurries out back.
TOM
Mrs. Wilson...  Nick Carraway.
MYRTLE
A	pleasure...

Nick’s a writer... 
Myrtle is completely uninterested.

Get on the next train.
MYRTLE

Now... ? Are we gettin’ that dog?
TOM
Whatever you want. And you can call

She’ll like him...

Oh no, that’s alright, I’m busy...

The muffled sounds of sex... 
CLOSE ON: A puppy mouthing a soggy dog biscuit that dissolves into a saucer of milk.
Nick, horrified, perches on a couch in a small room stuffed with tacky, pretentious objects; obviously bought by Tom.
Nick springs to his feet and yanks open the front door, only to be startled by a slender, louche girl in her twenties, with a sticky bob of red hair. This is CATHERINE.
She sweeps into the room, pivots, and extends her hand.
CATHERINE
I’m Catherine; ain’t we havin’ a
party?
NICK
Oh, I’m...  I’m not sure now’s a
good time-- I was just going--
But Nick’s exit is blocked.
MRS. MCKEE
Hello... !
MRS. MCKEE, a shrill woman in her 30s, enters with MR. MCKEE - a feminine man with a bit of shaving cream on his cheek.
MR. MCKEE
(extending his hand)
Chester McKee, pleasure to meet
you.
NICK
Nick Carraway.
22.
MRS. MCKEE
Where’re the kids?
Nick is still trying to leave, but Catherine corners him... 
CATHERINE
What’s the matter? Don’t ya like
me?
SUDDENLY! The bedroom door whooshes open and Myrtle appears wearing an astounding, red jersey sheath dress.
MRS. MCKEE
Myrtle Turtle... ! Oh, that dress is adorable!
MYRTLE
(with impressive hauteur)
It's just a crazy old thing. I slip it on when I don't care what I look like!
Tom appears behind Myrtle, arrogantly buttoning his shirt.
TOM
Get some ice Myrtle, before
everyone goes to sleep.
Myrtle sweeps into the kitchen; Tom opens the liquor cabinet.
NICK
(making for the door)
Tom, I really should be going... 
TOM
(grabbing Nick’s arm)
Nonsense... 
NICK
Tom; I don’t think-- Daisy’s my--
Tom pulls Nick back toward the party.
TOM
Listen Nick, you like to watch; I remember that from college. And that’s OK, I make no judgment; but we’ve got a whole summer - do you want to sit on the sideline and watch, or do you want to play ball?
CATHERINE
Yeah. Ain’t we good enough for ya?
23.
Catherine winks, pushes Nick into his chair, and fearlessly lands herself in his lap.
CATHERINE (CONT’D)
Take off yer hat and stay awhile... 
TOM
Hey Nick! McKee’s in the artistic
game.
MCKEE
Photography.
TOM
Nick’s artistic.
NICK
No... 
MCKEE
Really?
NICK
Ah, no, well, I write a little... 
Tom clunks the gramophone needle onto a record and Catherine raises her voice above the music.
CATHERINE
Do you live on Long Island, too?
NICK
I live at West Egg.
CATHERINE
Really? I was there at a party
about a month ago. At a man named
Gatsby's. Do you know him?
NICK
I live right next door to him... 
CATHERINE
He's a cousin of Kaiser Wilhelm's.
You know, the evil German king... 
CUT TO: Tom raising Myrtle’s skirt suggestively.
TOM
Hey McKee, take a picture of that!
MYRTLE

Oh, don’t!

MYRTLE (CONT'D)
I’m not one of those models... ! But
you can if you want... 
Catherine leans close and whispers in Nick’s ear.
CATHERINE
Neither of them can stand who
they're married to.
NICK
Doesn’t she like Wilson either?
MYRTLE
(overhears)
... He’s a greasy little scumbag!
Tom grins arrogantly and offers a drink to Catherine.
CATHERINE
No thanks; I feel just as good on
nothing at all... 
With a suggestive glimpse of tongue, Catherine pops a pill... 
CATHERINE (CONT’D)
Nerve pills, I get them from a
doctor in Queens. You want one?
NICK
My nerves are fine thanks... 
Catherine smiles mischievously, puts a pill on her tongue and suddenly kisses Nick...  He splutters, but Catherine tips the scotch to his mouth, washing the pill down.
NICK (V.O.)
I had been drunk just twice in my
life and the second time was that
afternoon... 
DISSOLVE TO: Blurry freakish images of time passing...  The whiskey is in demand by all; Catherine dances a solo. The music is sexy, dirty, deafening. The images become wilder, nauseatingly violent... 
As Catherine undresses Nick... 
NICK (V.O.)
That night, in the hidden flat that Tom kept for Myrtle, we were buoyed by a sort of chemical madness, a willingness of the heart that burst thunderously upon us all...  And suddenly, I began to like New York.
25.
As the puppy sits on the table groaning faintly through the smoke, Myrtle suddenly springs to her feet!
MYRTLE
... I've got to get a massage, and a wave, and a collar for the dog, and one of those cute little ash-trays where you touch a spring, and a wreath with a black silk bow for mother's grave!
Pivoting through the smoky air, Myrtle begins to strip... 
MYRTLE (CONT’D)
My dear I'm giving you this dress!
Myrtle strips as Mrs. McKee greedily lunges for the dress.
MRS. MCKEE
Adorable! Adorable!
SUDDEN CUT: Nick, very drunk, finds himself at the bathroom window, observing the infinite life of the city...

High over the city our yellow windows must have contributed their share of human secrets to the casual watcher in the street...

Nick, simultaneously in the street below, can see himself upstairs looking out from Myrtle’s window.
NICK (V.O.)
I was within and without; enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life... 
POETIC VISUAL: The Manhattan skyline - millions of lighted windows frame silhouettes of this inexhaustible humanity...

TOM
You’ve got no right to speak her

Tom and Myrtle emerge from the bedroom half-dressed...

Nick’s been reading to the Doctor. He sits on the couch, many hand-written pages on his lap. He admits... 
NICK
I have no clue how I got home.
EXT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - PORCH - MORNING
Nick is still asleep. Harsh morning light.
CLOSE ON: His eyelids slowly flutter awake.
He realizes he’s been sleeping on the porch in his underwear.
NICK (V.O.)
But I do know that I awoke with a
distinctly uneasy feeling... 
His pants lie next to him, his shirt is on the railing, his
jacket is in a tree, and his car is parked in the bushes... 
A sudden feeling of disquiet makes Nick look up... 
NICK (V.O.)
... .that Gatsby was watching me.
27.
INT. SANITARIUM - DOCTOR’S OFFICE - WINTER - DAY
The Doctor leans forward.
DOCTOR
(slightly incredulous)
Watching you... ?
NICK
Yes. He was watching me. In fact, I know now that Gatsby was always watching me... 
DOCTOR
And how do you know that?
NICK
Because I got an invitation...  I
was the only one.
FADE IN IMAGE: An immaculate CHAUFFEUR, in uniform of robin's egg blue, stands on Nick’s doorstep, holding a silver tray on which rests an invitation... 
NICK(CONT’D)
No one, except me, every received an actual invitation to Gatsby’s... 
The words written on the invitation PUSH FORWARD: “Dear Mr. Carraway, the honor would be entirely mine, if you would attend my little party... ”
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - TWILIGHT
A line of limousines stretches from the lights of Manhattan towards Gatsby’s gates.
NICK (V.O.)
You see, the rest of New York
simply came, uninvited... 
As an open-topped Rolls Royce motors through Gatsby’s gates, a roadster packed with rowdy revellers, swerves onto the verge and roars cheekily by... 
NICK (V.O.)
The whole city packed into automobiles and all weekend, every weekend, ended up at Gatsby’s... 
28.
CRANE HIGH AND WIDE: Gatsby’s magnificent castle. Illuminated fountains line a driveway packed with limousines; crowds of glamorous people stream up the broad marble stairs.
EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - PORTICO - TWILIGHT
Dressed in white flannels, Nick offers his invitation to a doorman who shrugs.
NICK (V.O.)
And I mean everyone: from every walk of life, from every corner of New York City, this kaleidoscopic carnival spilled through Gatsby’s door... 
A gaggle of gorgeous, but obviously low-class girls, carelessly sweep Nick through the portico and into... 
INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - HALL OF MASTERS - CONTINUOUS
A bizarre mix of characters surge toward light at the end of this dark, vaulting, vomitorium-like passageway. BANG! Doors burst open; the dazzling spectacle of the Grand Ballroom... !
INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - GRAND BALLROOM - TWILIGHT
Champagne fountains vault to the ceiling. At the base of the fountains waiters scoop finger-bowl sized glasses onto trays.
Nick, almost unable to believe his eyes, takes in the impossible variety of guests at Gatsby’s... 
NICK (V.O)
A caravansary of... 
IMAGES OF THE VARIOUS CHARACTERS illustrate his voice-over... 
NICK (V.O.)
Billionaire play-boy publishers,
and their blond nurses...  Heiresses
comparing inheritances on Gatsby’s
beach...  My boss, Walter Chase,
losing money at the roulette
tables...  Gossip columnists... 
Alongside gangsters and governors
exchanging telephone numbers...  Silent film stars...  Broadway directors...  Morality protectors...  Casino collectors... 
(MORE)
29.
NICK (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Underage hecklers...  And Ewing
Klipspringer, dubious descendent of
Beethoven!
Overwhelmed, and out-of-place, Nick approaches the bar... 
NICK
(to the bartender)
Do you know where I might find the host, Mr. Gatsby?
He brandishes his invitation.
NICK (CONT’D)
I live just next door... 
BARTENDER
Mr. Gatsby? I’ve never seen him
sir. Why, no one has... 
The bartender automatically hands Nick a martini.
NICK (V.O.)
Alone, and a little embarrassed, I decided to get...  roaring drunk.
He downs the martini in one gulp, steps over an even drunker guest, who collapses at his feet, and makes his way out to:
EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - TERRACE - TWILIGHT
Nick gazes out over the impossibly decadent party... 
NICK
Wow.
As, unbeknownst to him, a mysterious, masked guest stalks toward him from behind... 
VOICE
I thought I might see you here... 
Startled, Nick turns to find...  Jordan Baker.
NICK
Hello.
JORDAN
I remembered you lived next door... 
NICK
Its like...  an amusement park.
30.
JORDAN
Shall we?
Jordan seductively leads Nick down the terrace steps... 
NICK
Did you get an invitation?
JORDAN
People aren’t invited to Gatsby’s.
NICK
Well I was...  I seem to be the only one. Who is this Gatsby?
A haughty East Egger, TEDDY, interjects... 
TEDDY
He was a German spy during the war.
JORDAN
Teddy Barton. Nick Carraway.
NICK
(to Teddy)
A German spy... ?
Teddy’s annoying East Egger friend, NELSON, chimes in... 
NELSON
No, no, no, no. He’s the Kaiser’s
assassin.
And the third of the East Egger trio, LANGUID GIRL, adds... 
LANGUID GIRL
I heard he killed a man once.
NELSON
Its true!
LANUID GIRL
You look at him sometimes when he
thinks no one’s watching...  I’ll
bet he killed a man.
TEDDY
Kills for fun! Free of charge.
NELSON
Well he’s already richer than God.
Nick turns to Jordan; an alarmed whisper.
31.
NICK
You don’t believe he killed a man
do you... ?
JORDAN
(wickedly)
Let’s go find him, and you can ask him yourself... 
As the dance-floor erupts, and world-famous dancer Gilda Grey is announced, Jordan leads Nick off... 
INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - GRAND BALLROOM - EVENING
MUSIC FEVERISHLY BUILDS! As Nick and Jordan bound up a winding staircase, Jordan teases seductively... 
JORDAN
Oh, Mr. Gatsby... !
(to Nick)
Shall I lead you into his clutches?
INT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - LIBRARY - EVENING
BANG! Nick and Jordan explode into a dark room. A stout, middle-aged man wheels to them with unsettling intensity.
OWL EYES
You won’t find him... !
He plucks two finger-bowl sized cocktails from a row lined up on the table and hands them to Nick and Jordan.
OWL EYES (CONT’D)
This house and everything in it,
are all part of an elaborate
disguise. But Mr. Gatsby doesn’t
exist.
JORDAN
Phooey; I’ve met him!
OWL EYES
Which one; the Prince, the Spy, the Murderer? I’ve been wandering his halls drunk for about a week now - but no matter where I look, I can’t find anyone who knows anything real about Mr. Gatsby.
32.
JORDAN
(blithely dismissive)
Well I don’t care; he gives large parties - and I like large parties, they’re so intimate; at small parties there isn't any privacy.
NICK
(slowly to Owl Eyes)
But if that’s true; what’s all this for... ?
OWL EYES
That, my dear fellow, is the
question... 
Owl Eyes looks to the window; and Nick and Jordan follow his gaze to...  Gatsby’s garden, where, as the band hits fever pitch, and twilight becomes night...  THE PARTY HAS BEGUN!!!!
EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - POOL - NIGHT
As the music nears its final crescendo, the evening’s many fantastical characters dance uproariously around the pool!!!
On an elaborate flotilla in the center of it all Jordan and Nick are kicking a wild Charleston. The number finally peaks!
NICK
I didn’t expect all this... 
JORDAN
(coy)
What did you expect?
NICK
I don’t know... 
JORDAN
Disappointed?
NICK
Not in the slightest... 
Jordan and Nick look as if they might just kiss... 
TEDDY
(to Nick)
Penny-less pantywaist!
Teddy leers between them and pulls Jordan away... 
33.
TEDDY (CONT’D)
I’m stealing her away Carraway!
Over wild applause, the ORCHESTRA LEADER announces... 
ORCHESTRA LEADER
Ladies and gentlemen, please make
your way to the grand terrazzo; for
the premiere of Mr. Vladimir
Tostoff's “A Jazz History of the
World”, and accompanying fireworks!
Nick follow Jordan, but Teddy cuts him off--
TEDDY
Look around you! Rich girls don’t
marry poor boys--
On cue, a drinks tray floats into frame. There is a flurry of movement...  Teddy rudely snatches a couple of martinis... 
Nick, disoriented and empty-handed, begins up the stairs, and
as he does so, hears the voice of the man holding the tray... 
MAN
Your face is familiar. Weren't you in the Third Division during the war?
NICK
Yes; The Ninth Battalion.
CUT TO: THE MAN. He is tanned and handsome; just past thirty.
MAN
I was in the Seventh. I knew I'd seen you somewhere before...  Having a good time, old sport?
NICK
(very tipsy)
The whole thing’s incredible - I
live next door... 
(brandishing his now
crumpled invitation)
He even sent me an invitation, but I still haven’t met Mr. Gatsby, no one’s met him; they say he’s third cousin to the Kaiser and second cousin to the devil!
At the landing, half way up the steps, the man takes a drink from a waiter’s tray and hands it to Nick... 
34.
MAN
I’m afraid I’m not a very good
host, old sport...  I’m Gatsby.
CLOSE ON: Nick - his face drops.
NICK
(muttering apologies)
Oh.. I’m very sorry-- I...  I’ve had so much to drink... 
The delirious opening chords of Tostoff’s “History” coincide with a gorgeous explosion of fireworks in the night sky!
GATSBY
(apologetically)
I thought you knew, old sport.
Gatsby smiles a dazzling smile; sound fades to a serene hum.
NICK (V.O.)
His smile was one of those rare smiles that you may come across four or five times in life. It seemed to understand you and believe in you just as you would like to be understood and believed in.
All at once the bubble bursts, a silver-haired, fifty-ish man in an immaculate tail-suit, (HERZOG) leans into Gatsby.
HERZOG
Excuse me sir; Chicago on the wire.
Gatsby nods, but before he departs he smiles at Nick.
GATSBY
I’m trying out my new hydroplane in the morning. Want to go with me, old sport?
Nick shakes himself from his reverie.
NICK
What time?
GATSBY
Any time that suits you.
Gatsby turns, and catches for the first time, Jordan.
GATSBY (CONT’D)
Lovely to see you Miss Baker.
