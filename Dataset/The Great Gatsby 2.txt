He kisses her lightly on the hand.
GATSBY (CONT’D)
(to Nick)
If you need anything, just ask for it, old sport. I will rejoin you later...  Excuse me.
As Nick watches Gatsby walk away, he whispers with amazement.
NICK
I expected him to be... 
JORDAN
Old and fat?
NICK
Well, yes; young men don’t just drift coolly out of nowhere and buy a palace on Long Island.
JORDAN
He told me once he was an Oxford man. However, I don't believe it... 
NICK
Why not?
JORDAN
I don’t know...  I just don’t
believe he went there... 
Jordan is interrupted by a voice.
HERZOG
I beg your pardon... 
She and Nick jump to find Herzog suddenly beside them.
HERZOG (CONT’D)
Miss Baker; Mr. Gatsby would like
to speak to you...  Alone.
JORDAN
(surprised)
Me?
HERZOG
Yes, madame.
As Vladimir Tostoff’s erotic, ominous chords build, Jordan crosses the now empty dance floor toward the silhouette of Gatsby in the library window... 
36.
Nick, unsettled, watches her go... 
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - MAPROOM - LATER
Alarmingly drunk girls sprawl at the feet of the grand piano. Klipspringer plays, a weeping woman attempts to slur along, and as a dejected Nick passes them toward the front stairs, the library door opens, and Jordan emerges alone... 
Seeing Nick, she rushes to him... 
JORDAN
Nick! Nick! I've just heard the
most shocking thing; it all makes
sense... 
Teddy and the other East Eggers accost Jordan.
TEDDY
Where have you been!? The car’s
waiting!
Jordan is dragged out the door...  Nick, on tenterhooks follows, as Jordan calls back... 
JORDAN
Simply amazing! It all makes sense.
It all makes sense... 
EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - NIGHT
The night has devolved into drunken mayhem as cars jam the driveway and intoxicated guests search for their vehicles.
Nick chases Jordan down the marble stairs.
NICK
What makes sense... ?
JORDAN
Everything...  But here I am
tantalizing you... 
The East Eggers and Jordan pile into their limousine. Jordan, a mysterious smile as she leans out the window.
JORDAN (CONT’D)
And I swore I wouldn’t tell.
37.
NICK
But... 
JORDAN
Nick. I’m sorry, I swore I wouldn’t tell.
The car takes off and Nick is left staring; mystified... 
A voice startles him.
GATSBY
Sorry to keep her from you, old sport. Don't forget; we're going up in the hydroplane tomorrow morning.
Herzog appears behind Gatsby.
HERZOG
Philadelphia on the phone, sir.
Gatsby nods, then smiles that intoxicating smile.
GATSBY
Good night, old sport... 
NICK
Good night. Thank you.
Gatsby nods warmly, and turns inside.
As Nick walks away he is confronted by a bizarre scene: a big crowd gathers around a COUPÉ, resting on its side in a ditch.
SUDDENLY! Owl Eyes pops from the wreck. He leers drunkenly... 
OWL EYES
Whazza matter!? We run outta gas!?
The beep of a horn catches Nick’s attention. Jordan, leaning out of the window of her car as it sweeps away, calls to him.
JORDAN
Come and see me...  We’ll have tea!
I’m in the phone-book!
Nick waves, smiles, and cuts across the lawn.
CLOSE ON: Nick. As he reaches the stone-pass separating his yard from Gatsby’s, he stops; a familiar feeling... 
38.
INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - TOWER - CONTINUOUS
High up in the window, the shadowy figure of Gatsby stands, phone pressed to his ear, watching Nick. After a moment, he raises his hand in formal farewell.
NICK (V.O)
We rode in the hydroplane...  And I attended two more of his parties, even made use of his beach. But I soon realized that I knew absolutely nothing about Gatsby at all, until... 
INT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - MORNING
Nick is eating breakfast, studying bonds, when his glass of orange juice begins to rattle and shake.
Puzzled, Nick hurries to the window... 
EXT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - CONTINUOUS
Gatsby’s yellow Duesenberg hurtles up Nick’s drive and skids to a stop.
Nick emerges to his porch.
Gatsby leaps out!
GATSBY
Its pretty isn’t it, old sport... ? Haven’t you seen it before? Its all a custom job. Supercharged engine. Get dressed...  We’re having lunch!
SLAM CUT TO:
I/E. GATSBY’S CAR - LONG ISLAND COUNTRYSIDE - DAY
The Duesenberg whips and winds along a tree-lined road... 
Gatsby, beyond nervous, drives with reckless intensity.
GATSBY
Ah...  well...  Ah...  Look here, old sport...  What's your opinion of me, anyhow?
NICK
My...  opinion?
39.
GATSBY
Yes, yes, your opinion!
Gatsby yanks the wheel; Nick hangs on for dear life!
GATSBY (CONT’D)
I don't want you to get the wrong impression from all those bizarre accusations you must be hearing. A pack of lies I assure you. You’ve heard the stories... ?
NICK
Well--
GATSBY
I’ll tell you God’s truth. God’s
truth about myself!
(raises right hand)
I am the son of some very wealthy people from the Middle-West; sadly, all dead now...  I was brought up in America, but educated at Oxford; because all my ancestors have been educated there for many years. You see, it’s a...  a family tradition.
As Gatsby’s speech continues at breakneck speed...  Nick’s V.O. fades up.
NICK (V.O.)
The way he spoke...  No wonder
people thought he was lying... 
GATSBY
After that I lived like a young
Prince in all the capitals of
Europe!
NICK
Europe?
Barrelling around a blind turn, Gatsby wrenches at the wheel and maniacally overtakes a truck laden with farmhands... 
GATSBY
Yes, Europe! Paris; Venice; Rome;
Vienna, Zurich, Helsinki...  Collecting jewels, chiefly rubies, hunting big game, painting, a little, things for myself mostly, and trying to forget something very sad that happened to me long ago... 
40.
PAN UP: The Duesenberg rockets forth; in the far distance the lush green countryside cedes to the lifeless Valley of Ashes.
DISSOLVE TO:
I/E. GATSBY’S CAR/THE VALLEY OF ASHES - DAY
Gatsby hasn’t stopped for breath... 
GATSBY
Then came the war, old sport... 
NICK (V.O.)
Just when I thought it couldn’t be any more fantastical... 
GATSBY
It was a great relief and I tried
very hard to die, but I seemed to
bear an enchanted life... 
NICK (V.O.)
He became a war hero, single-handedly defeating the German army!
CLOSE ON: Gatsby. He speaks with sudden, subdued emotion.
GATSBY
In the Argonne Forest I took my machine gun detachment so far forward...  We were outnumbered five to one. There was a half mile gap on either side of us where the infantry couldn’t advance. We stayed there two days and two nights, 130 men with only 16 Lewis guns... 
Something catches Nick’s eye... 
NICK’S POV: Myrtle Wilson pumps gas outside Wilson’s Garage.
GATSBY (CONT’D)
... When the infantry came up at last they found the insignia of 3 German divisions among the piles of the dead.
SCREEECHHH!!! Gatsby slams to halt at the train crossing!
41.
GATSBY (CONT’D)
I was promoted to Major and every Allied government gave me a decoration; even Montenegro! Little Montenegro down on the Adriatic Sea.
SLAM! A medal is suddenly in Nick’s lap.
GATSBY (CONT’D)
Here! That’s the one from
Montenegro.
It looks authentic.
GATSBY (CONT’D)
Turn it.
NICK
(reads)
Major Jay Gatsby. For Valor
Extraordinary.
GATSBY
That’s right.
SLAP! A photograph joins the medal.
GATSBY (CONT’D)
Here’s another thing that I always carry. A souvenir of my Oxford days; the man on my left is now the Earl of Doncaster.
CLOSE ON: The photograph. Young men in blazers loaf in front of Oxford College. Gatsby stands with a cricket bat in hand.
NICK (V.O.)
What could I say... ? The photograph was undoubtedly authentic. Could it all be true?
DING! The gate lifts. And as Gatsby peels out, towards New York, he continues... 
GATSBY (O.S.)
But don’t take my word for it. At lunch, I’m going to introduce you to one of New York’s most distinguished businessmen; my friend, Mr. Meyer Wolfsheim, who will confirm all I’ve told you, and vouch for my good character... 
42.
I/E. GATSBY’S CAR - ASTORIA - DAY
Gatsby weaves between the pylons of the elevated highway.
NICK
I’m sure that’s not necessary... 
Gatsby wheels to Nick, smiling with charming intensity.
GATSBY
Oh but it is though... ! You see, I thought you ought to know something about my life. I...  I don’t want you to think I’m just some...  some nobody. You see, old sport, I’m going to make a very big request of you today.
NICK
A big request?
GATSBY
Yes. Yes...  Miss Baker will explain everything when you take her to tea this afternoon.
NICK
(caught off guard)
Jordan... ? What’s she got to do
with it?
GATSBY
Oh, I assure you it’s nothing
underhand. Miss Baker’s an honest
sportswoman; she’d never do
anything that wasn’t alright... 
RRIIIRRRAA! A shrieking police siren! Before Gatsby can continue, a MOTORCYCLE COP pulls alongside.
COP
Pull over!!! Pull over to the curb!
GATSBY
(calmly)
All right, old sport! Alright.
Without slowing, Gatsby takes a card from his pocket... 
COP
(embarrassed)
Right you are...  Know you next
time, Mr. Gatsby. Excuse me!
43.
The cop peels off; and the Duesenberg, carrying an absolutely mystified Nick, rockets towards the Queensboro Bridge!
NICK
One of your old Oxford pals?
GATSBY
Well...  actually, I was able to do the Commissioner a favor once; he sends a Christmas card every year.
(adds proudly)
I imagine he’ll be at lunch too... 
NICK
By the time we reached the bridge I was impossibly confused... 
Nick turns to see: A Rolls Royce in which two stylish AFRICAN AMERICAN MEN and a WOMAN haughtily quaff champagne. They are driven by a WHITE CHAUFFEUR.
An orchestral melody surges... 
NICK (V.O.)
I didn’t know what to think...  But the city seen from the Queensboro Bridge is always the city seen for the first time, in its first wild promise of all the mystery and the beauty in the world. Anything can happen now that we've slid over this bridge, I thought; anything at all... 
As the orchestra builds, Gatsby’s car shoots into Manhattan, through Times Square and beneath the famous advertisement of the man in the Arrow shirt. We follow, sweeping high over skyscrapers. The Duesenberg pulls up on the street below... 
SUDDENLY THE CAMERA PLUMMETS with startling velocity... 
NICK (V.O.)
Even Gatsby could happen... 
BAAAAM! A fat beat kicks as we explode through a grate, into:
INT. THE ANGRY DIAMOND SPEAKEASY - DAY
The sweaty grind of music shakes the air. On stage a pianist, THE PROFESSOR, bangs out a sizzling tune!
PULL THROUGH A DOUBLE-GLASS MIRROR INTO:
44.
INT. DICK DIVER’S CUTS BARBERSHOP - CONTINUOUS
DISCOVER: Nick and Gatsby entering the cramped shop... 
In the center of the room a tall, distinguished, grey-bearded man in an exquisitely cut suit, and with gold rings on every finger, is having a beard trim. This, is MEYER WOLFSHEIM.
WOLFSHEIM
Ah my boy... !
They embrace.
GATSBY
Meyer, Meyer... 
WOLFSHEIM
You smell so good.
GATSBY
Mr. Carraway; my friend, Mr.
Wolfsheim.
Gatsby guides Nick and Wolfsheim toward the back of the shop.
WOLFSHEIM
A wonderful pleasure, Mr. Carraway.
I know all about you.
NICK
Really?
WOLD
Of course! Mr. Gatsby is always
talking about you.
Gatsby raps a coded knock on a hidden door at the back of the shop. The door slides open, the rumble of music pours out... 
WOLFSHEIM
(sinister)
Come, join us for a little lunch... 
INT. THE ANGRY DIAMOND SPEAKEASY - CONTINUOUS
Gatsby ushers Wolfsheim and Nick down narrow creaking stairs, through the crowd and into the smoke-filled speakeasy... 
ECU: Nick, taking in his NEW, SEEDY surroundings.
45.
WOLFSHEIM
(whispers to Gatsby)
Tell Walter Chase; “he shuts his mouth or he doesn’t get a penny... ”
GATSBY
We’ll talk about that later... 
The HEAD WAITER appears.
HEAD WAITER
Highballs, Mr. Gatsby?
GATSBY
Yes, highballs it is.
(points to Nick)
You take good care of my friend
here!
A portly man of obvious stature, surrounded by scantily clad flappers, yells from a corner booth.
COMMISSIONER
Hey Jay... ! You’re under arrest!!!
Gatsby smiles and tips his hat.
GATSBY
You be careful now. You’re turning into a real Jazz-Hound Commissioner.
(to Nick)
See, that’s the Commissioner back
there.
Gatsby, the king here, greets patrons high and low... 
He sees SENATOR GULICK at the craps table.
GATSBY (CONT’D)
You be careful at those tables now
Senator!
SENATOR GULICK
Of course! I’ll put a bet on for
you Jay!
Waiters clear a front row table - best seat in the house - Gatsby helps Wolfsheim to his. Wolfsheim eyes the girls on the stage.
Gatsby flashes Nick a charming smile.
46.
GATSBY
Shall we order?
(to the waiter)
Lobster tails all round.
(to Nick)
They decorate it with truffle
slices and fine herbs. Very
artistic.
Wolfsheim glances to Gatsby, and then turns again to Nick... 
WOLFSHEIM
So...  How is the bond business Mr.
Carraway?
NICK
It’s fine, thank you.
WOLFSHEIM
I understand you’re looking for a
business gonnegtion--
GATSBY
No, no. This isn't the man. This is the friend I told you about.
WOLFSHEIM
Oh! Beg your pardon, I had a wrong man.
Woldsheim pats Nick on the back, unsettling him further... 
Gatsby, a quick glance to his watch and Wolfsheim, jumps up.
GATSBY
Now, if you’ll excuse me. I have to make THAT call.
(gesturing to Nick)
Meyer, do you mind?
Gatsby leaving Nick and Wolfsheim alone.
WOLFSHEIM
Gatsby! What a gentleman! From one of the finest families in the Midwest...  Sadly all dead now. Let me tell you, when I made the pleasure of Mr. Gatsby’s acquaintance just after the war, I knew I had discovered a man of fine breeding. A war hero! Such...  medals. And, an Oggsford man.
Oggsford College in England. You
know Oggsford?
47.
NICK
I've heard of it... 
WOLFSHEIM
Then you would know that a man like that can be trusted. With a friend, with someone like you, he would never so much as look at your wife... 
NICK
I’m not...  married.
WOLFSHEIM
But you work on Wall Street, right?
NICK
(totally confused)
Yes... 
Nick studies Wolfsheim, noticing an oddity about his outfit.
WOLFSHEIM
Looking at my tiepin?
CLOSE ON: The pin.
WOLFSHEIM (CONT’D)
Finest specimen of human molars... 
Before Nick can recover, Gatsby suddenly returns.
GATSBY
Gentlemen. Everything alright... ?
NICK
Oh, yes...  We were just talking
about other people’s wives... 
GATSBY
(taking his seat)
Other people’s wives? Ah...  I see.
Gatsby looks to Wolfsheim.
GATSBY (CONT’D)
Other people’s wives...  Meyer?
Wolfsheim nods, smiles, and checks out the dancing girls... 
WOLFSHEIM
Well, my work here is done. I’ll
leave you gentlemen to talk about
your sports and your women... 
48.
Wolfsheim follows his favorite dancer off... 
GATSBY
You’ll have to excuse him...  In his old age, he’s prone to “digress... ” He’s a regular around here; a real denizen of Broadway... 
NICK
Who is he anyhow?
GATSBY
Meyer? He’s a gambler.
Over Nick and Gatsby’s shoulders is Wolfsheim, mingling with the ladies; but occasionally glancing in their direction... 
NICK
An actor?
GATSBY
Meyer? No. He’s the man who fixed
the 1919 World Series.
NICK
Fixed it?
GATSBY
Fixed it.
NICK
How did he manage that?
GATSBY
He just...  saw the opportunity, I
suppose. He’s a very smart man.
(tries to change subject)
Now, old sport, about Miss Baker,
and that request we spoke of... 
Before Gatsby can go on, Tom Buchanan looms over the table.
TOM
Hey Nick! Nick! Where’ve you been!? Daisy’s furious you haven’t called up.
Nick and Gatsby stand.
NICK
This is Mr. Gatsby, Mr. Buchanan.
CLOSE ON: Gatsby. With strange intensity he offers his hand.
49.
GATSBY
I’m so very, very...  delighted to
make your acquaintance.
Tom turns back to Nick.
TOM
I wouldn’t have expected to find
you in this temple of virtue.
NICK
I'm having lunch with Mr. Gats--
Nick turns, but inexplicably, Gatsby is gone.
PUSH TOWARD: Nick, surprise rising into anger... 
CUT TO:
EXT. THE HOTEL SAYRE - ROOFTOP GARDEN - DUSK
Jordan is perched at an elegant table, overlooking Times Square and the advertisement of the man in the beautiful Arrow shirts.
DISCOVER: Nick, frustrated, dodging the fashionable and famous... 
NICK
I’m looking for Ms. Baker. Yes. The famous sporting star. The golfer...  There...  I’ve spotted her.
Nick comes to an abrupt halt in front of Jordan.
NICK (CONT’D)
What game are you and Gatsby
playing at!?
An immaculate MAITRE’D offers Nick a chair.
MAITRE’D
Will the gentleman be joining?
NICK
(frustrated)
One moment please--
JORDAN
Please, Nick, sit down. This is a
polite restaurant.
As Nick’s frustration and Jordan’s embarrassment grow--
50.
NICK
It’s all very strange. He picks me up in his fancy yellow car...  And he’s going on and on and on about his life and the war and rubies and Oxford and...  What is--
JORDAN
If you’ll just have a seat--
NICK
What is this big request!?
JORDAN
Nick--! He just wants you to invite
Daisy to tea.
NICK
Tea?
(not what Nick expected)
Daisy... ? And Gatsby... ?
Nick sits... 
NICK (CONT’D)
Why?
JORDAN
Well...  I don’t know quite where to start. You see...  I met Gatsby, five years ago, in Louisville... 
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. DAISY’S HOUSE - LOUISVILLE - DAY
TIGHT ON: Golf shoes biting into soft, green grass.
JORDAN (O.S.)
It was the day I got my new English golf shoes.
WIDE: A row of fancy Louisville homes - red, white and blue bunting “tut, tutting” in the breeze - are set along a beautiful, green stretch of park.
JORDAN (O.S.) (CONT’D)
Daisy was by far the most popular
girl with the Officers from Camp
Taylor... 
Across the road, 18 YEAR OLD DAISY is perched in the front seat of her flashy white roadster, beaming, happy... 
51.
JORDAN (O.S.) (CONT’D)
One of them was in the car with
her.
Beside Daisy REVEAL: A handsome lieutenant: YOUNG JAY GATSBY.
JORDAN (O.S.) (CONT’D)
It was Gatsby. And the way he
looked at her... 
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. THE HOTEL SAYRE - ROOFTOP GARDEN - DUSK
The silhouettes of Jordan and Nick, leaned close, are lit magnificently against the beaded lights of the city... 
JORDAN (O.S.)
Is the way all girls want to be
looked at.
Their eyes meet; a conspiring flicker.
NICK
(blown away)
So what happened?
JORDAN
Well, I don’t know... 
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. FRENCH BATTLEFIELD - DAY
Gatsby leads his men on a heroic charge out of the trenches--
JORDAN (O.S.)
Gatsby was sent off to war... 
A MASSIVE EXPLOSION rocks the battlefield!
JORDAN (O.S.) (CONT’D) But when the war ended...  For some unknown reason, Gatsby couldn’t return... 
DISSOLVE TO:
MONTAGE.
A NEWSPAPER FILLS THE SCREEN:

“AMERICA’S WEALTHIEST BACHELOR TO WED: TOM BUCHANAN LURES LOUISVILLE’S SWEETHEART.”
JORDAN (O.S.)
A year later, Tom Buchanan of
Chicago swept in and stole her
away... 
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. SEELBACH HOTEL - DAISY’S GRAND SUITE - NIGHT
An exquisite string of pearls coils around Daisy’s neck.
JORDAN (O.S.)
He gave her a string of pearls
worth $350,000.
REVEAL: Tom, tightening the clasp.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. SEELBACH HOTEL. DAISY’S GRAND SUITE - MORNING
JORDAN (O.S.)
But, the morning of the wedding,
Daisy received a letter... 
On the bed, Daisy, hysterical, clutches a bottle in one hand and a letter in the other.
DAISY
(screams)
Tell them Daisy’s changed her mind!
JORDAN
Daisy! Please, everyone’s waiting!
Daisy reaches for the pearls around her neck... 
YOUNG DAISY
Give them back!!
Suddenly! Daisy tears the pearls and hurls them; they explode into a hundred shimmering pieces against the hard wood floor!
CUT TO: A set of stern, white heels clicking down the hall... 
REVEAL: Daisy’s hard-mouthed MOTHER.
DAISY’S MOTHER
What on earth is going on in here!?
53.
her mother’s eyes land on the bottle, and then the letter... 
PUSH IN: The last line of the letter reads: Love, Jay.
DAISY
Leave me alone!
DAISY’S MOTHER
Jordan, run the bath! Now!
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. SEELBACH HOTEL - BATHROOM - MORNING
In the bath, Daisy’s grips the letter in her trembling hands.
NICK (O.S.)
What was in the letter?
A deep breath, a last look, and then, Daisy opens her hand... 
The letter comes to pieces like snow.
JORDAN (O.S.)
I don’t know. She wouldn’t tell me.
But before the letter disappears completely we read one more line: “The truth is... ”
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. LOUISVILLE CHURCH - FRONT STEPS - LATE AFTERNOON
Daisy and Tom, newly married, pose for photos.
JORDAN (O.S.)
Anyways, that day, at five o’clock, Daisy Faye married Tom Buchanan with more pomp and circumstance than Louisville had ever seen... 
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT
Jordan and Nick stroll beneath the soaring electric signs.
JORDAN
After the honeymoon, I saw them in Santa Barbara. It was touching, actually... 
(MORE)
54.
JORDAN (CONT'D)
I’d never seen a girl so in love
with her husband.
(muses cynically)
A week later, Tom crashed his car. The girl with him was a chambermaid at the Santa Barbara Hotel. It got into all the papers... 
As Jordan and Nick approach the curb, waiting for a cab, Nick turns to Jordan; he’s struck by a...  sudden, puzzled thought.
NICK
It’s a strange coincidence, isn’t
it? Gatsby’s house being just
across the bay... 
Jordan whirls round--
JORDAN
It’s no coincidence. He bought that house to be near her, he threw all those parties hoping she’d wander in one night. He constantly asked about Daisy...  I was the first one who knew her.
Nick takes this in; as if seeing Gatsby for the first time.
NICK
All that for a girl he hasn’t seen in five years... ? And now he just wants me to have her for tea... ?
(to himself)
The modesty of it.
JORDAN
Kind of takes your breath away,
doesn’t it?
A cab pulls up, and Nick opens the door... 
INT. TAXI - CONTINUOUS
Jordan slides in... 
TAXI DRIVER
Evening sweethearts! Where to?
JORDAN
Long Island, please.
55.
NICK
And you think I should? I mean,
does Daisy want to see Gatsby?
JORDAN
(a stern whisper)
She’s absolutely not to know. You are just supposed to invite her over so he can “happen to drop by.”
CLOSE ON: Nick, unsure... 
NICK (V.O.)
I remember feeling torn. Was it right to bring my cousin Daisy, a married woman, together with a man I hardly knew?
As Nick wonders, the taxi floats across Times Square, under the cool eyes of the man in the Arrow shirt... 
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. DIRT TRACK TO NICK’S BUNGALOW - NIGHT
Nick’s taxi pulls past Gatsby’s mansion, ablaze with light.
NICK (V.O.)
When I returned home, Gatsby’s was lit, from tower to cellar, as if for another wild party. But...  There wasn’t a sound.
EXT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - NIGHT
As Nick’s taxi groans away, Gatsby appears striding through the illuminated trees toward Nick.
NICK
Your place looks like the World’s
Fair...  or Coney Island!
GATSBY
(terribly anxious)
Ah, does it? I’ve...  I’ve just been glancing into some rooms...  Let’s go to Coney Island, old sport, we can take my car--
NICK
It’s too late tonight.
56.
GATSBY
Or we can take a plunge in the
swimming pool? I haven’t made use
of it all summer... 
NICK
I must go to bed... 
Gatsby looks crestfallen. Nick puts him out of his misery.
NICK (CONT’D)
Happy to do it. Jay-- I'm going to call Daisy and invite her to tea.
GATSBY
Oh, that’s alright. I don’t want to put you to any trouble... 
NICK
What day would suit you?
GATSBY
What day would suit you... ? I don’t want to put you to any trouble... 
NICK
Day after tomorrow alright?
GATSBY
Day after tomorrow? Well, I’d... 
I’d want to get the grass cut.
They both look at the grass - there is a sharp line where Nick’s ragged lawn ends and Gatsby’s manicured one begins.
GATSBY (CONT’D)
There’s another little thing...  I
thought-- Look here, old sport--
You don't make much money, do you?
NICK
Not really.
GATSBY
If you’ll pardon my...  You see, I
carry on a little business on the
side - a sort of sideline - you
understand what I’m saying right?
You’re selling bonds, aren’t you,
old sport?
NICK
Trying to.
57.
GATSBY
Well, this might interest you...  It happens to be a rather confidential sort of thing...  But you might pick up a nice bit of money.
NICK
I've got my hands full.
Gatsby’s face falls.
GATSBY
You wouldn't have to do any
business with Wolfsheim. I assure
you.
NICK
No, no, no...  Its a favor Jay. Just a favor.
Nick’s sincerity disarms Gatsby; a tiny, embarrassed nod.
NICK (CONT’D)
Happy to do it.
GATSBY
A favor?
NICK
Yes.
As if no one has ever done him a favor before in his life... 
GATSBY
Ah, right, right...  Goodnight.
NICK
Goodnight.
With this, Gatsby turns and strolls back toward his blazing castle. Nick’s gaze falls upon the unkempt lawn. He smiles.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - FRONT LAWN - DAY
TOP SHOT: An enormous mower clatters through frame, carving Nick’s unkempt lawn into a fresh, broad, band of green.
REVEAL: An army of gardnders giving Nick’s lawn and garden a make-over, fresh paint, new flowers, trimmed hedges... 
DISSOLVE TO:
58.
EXT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - FRONT LAWN - THE FOLLOWING DAY
Heavy rain now falls.
Gatsby, dressed in white flannel suit, silver shirt, and gold tie, leads a dozen umbrella-holding servants across the lawn. Herzog holds an umbrella over Gatsby; the other servants shelter extravagant floral arrangements in crystal vases... 
Nick watches the parade through his window, opening his door just as Gatsby arrives; the servants continue inside.
On the porch, Gatsby looks around distractedly.
GATSBY
One of the papers said they thought the rain would stop about four. I think it was the Journal... 
An awkward beat.
NICK
The grass looks fine.
GATSBY
Grass?
Gatsby looks at Nick without really comprehending, or seeing.
GATSBY (CONT’D)
What Grass?
SUDDEN CUT TO:
INT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - LIVING ROOM - DAY
TIGHT ON: A mantelpiece clock, ticking in the tense silence.
WIDER: The room is crowded with absurdly extravagant floral arrangements. Nick sits watching as Gatsby intensely paces. The silence stretches, and stretches...  Finally... 
GATSBY
Have you got everything you need?
NICK
Perhaps more flowers?
GATSBY
I think they did a fine job, don’t you?
59.
NICK
Beautiful.
GATSBY
You think it’s too much?
NICK
I think it’s what you want.
GATSBY
I think so too...  She’ll be
impressed, won’t she old sport?
NICK
I am.
With this, Gatsby straightens his suit, sits, and hurriedly checks his watch. Another long silence... 
PUSH IN ON: Gatsby...  SUDDENLY! He leaps to his feet!
GATSBY
I can’t wait all day. I’m leaving!
NICK
Don’t be silly. It’s just two
minutes to four... 
But Gatsby heads for the door... 
GATSBY
Nobody’s coming to tea. It’s too
late!
BEEEEEP! Gatsby glimpses Daisy’s Rolls Royce arriving out front, and turns to Nick, flushed with fresh panic.
NICK
It’s her.
PUSH IN ON GATSBY: Mind racing... 
EXT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - DAY
Daisy’s chauffeur-driven Rolls pulls up in the muddy drive.
As Nick assists Daisy from the car... 
DAISY
Is this absolutely where you live, my dearest one?
She looks at him with a mysterious smile.
60.
DAISY (CONT’D)
Why did I have to come alone? Are
you in love with me?
NICK
That’s the secret of Carraway
Castle.
(playing along)
Tell your chauffeur to go far away.
DAISY
Come back in an hour, Ferdie!
(grave murmur)
His name is Ferdie.
INT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - HALL - DAY
Daisy continues ahead into the living room.
Nick hangs back and listens hopefully to Daisy’s reaction at discovering Gatsby. He smiles as he hears a delighted... 
DAISY (O.S.)
Oh--! Oh, my goodness. I...  I can’t believe it. You-- Did you ransack a greenhouse?
INT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
DAISY
(to herself)
He is in love with me... 
Nick enters, but is shocked to discover that Gatsby is not there. Daisy’s merely been admiring the flower display... 
NICK
That’s funny.
DAISY
What’s funny?
KNOCK. KNOCK. Someone is at the door.
NICK
One moment... 
INT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - HALL - CONTINUOUS
Nick opens the door.
61.
Gatsby, pale as death and soaked, glares miserably at Nick.
NICK
What are you doing?
Without a word, Gatsby stalks past him, into... 
INT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Daisy, her back to the door, is still marvelling at the flowers. Then she turns. Sees Gatsby. A sharp intake of breath... 
The reunited lovers stand, staring at each other for a long, surreal, moment of disbelief. Gatsby, eyes locked to Daisy’s, is drowning in emotion. Daisy finally manages an artificial, choking murmur.
DAISY
I’m certainly glad to see you
again.
Gatsby’s face is flushed; the veins stand out on his neck as his lips spasm in a hopeless attempt to speak.
Finally, he finds words... 
GATSBY
I’m...  certainly glad to see you as well.
Their hearts pound - the tension excruciating.
EEEEKKK! The scream of a boiling kettle OFF SCREEN breaks the tension--
CUT TO:
INT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - LIVING ROOM - DAY
Gatsby reclines uncomfortably against the mantelpiece. His elbow rests near the mantelpiece CLOCK. Daisy sits opposite; frozen on the edge of a chair.
The rattle of the tea tray as Nick enters only contributes to the already unbearable tension. Gatsby manages to murmur.
GATSBY
We've met before... 
SUDDENLY the CLOCK tilts at the pressure of Gatsby’s elbow... 
62.
And falls! And breaks!
GATSBY (CONT’D)
Ah...  sorry... 
He clumsily tries to repair the clock; but drops it again!
NICK
(idiotically)
It's an old...  clock.
DAISY
(desperate for small talk)
Lovely though. A lovely...  clock.
Gatsby finally manages to set the clock back on the mantle.
Gatsby takes a seat.
A long silent beat.
DAISY (CONT’D)
We haven't met for many years.
GATSBY
(an automatic reflex)
Five years next November.
The precision of Gatsby's answer is acutely embarrassing.
NICK
(abruptly)
Tea?
GATSBY
(dying)
Thank you old sport.
DAISY
(also mortified)
Darling thank you.
Nick pours; and they all sit stiffly, sipping their tea.
A long, terrible silence... 
Suddenly Nick stands.
NICK
I just need to...  pop into town.
GATSBY
(horrified)
Town... ?
63.
NICK
The village; I'll be right back.
As Nick leaves, Gatsby follows.
GATSBY
I've got to speak to you... !
INT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
Wildly following Nick, Gatsby whispers miserably:
GATSBY
Oh, God! This is a mistake, a
terrible, terrible mistake... 
NICK
You're just embarrassed, that's
all...  Daisy's embarrassed too.
GATSBY
She's embarrassed?
NICK
Just as much as you are.
GATSBY
Don't talk so loud!
NICK
You're acting like a little boy!
You're rude. Daisy's in there all
alone and... 
Gatsby raises his hand, looks at Nick reproachfully, and heads back into the living room.
EXT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - CONTINUOUS
Nick runs for a TREE whose leaves shield against the rain.
NICK (V.O.)
Looking over my story so far, I’m
reminded that for the second time
that summer... 
WIDE: Nick beneath the tree looks tiny, and very alone.
NICK (V.O.)
I was guarding other people’s
secrets.
64.
INT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - LIVING ROOM - DAY
LATER. Nick re-enters, bedraggled, rain-soaked.
NICK (V.O.)
Once again I was within... 
He tries to get Gatsby and Daisy’s attention, to no avail... 
The lovers are completely and totally absorbed in each other.
NICK (V.O.)
And without... 
Nick bangs pots in the sink - still nothing.
He clears his throat:
NICK
Its...  stopped raining.
Daisy turns; a radiant smile. Every vestige of embarrassment between Daisy and Gatsby is gone. Gatsby literally glows.
GATSBY
Yes, it has... 
(to Daisy)
Hasn’t it?
He stands, walks to the window and looks out across the bay.
GATSBY (CONT’D)
What do you think of that, Daisy?
Come look.
Daisy joins Gatsby and they step out onto the porch together.
EXT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - PORCH - CONTINUOUS
DAISY
Look. Its my house. Just there
across the bay... 
Gatsby and Daisy’s eyes meet.
GATSBY
I know. I have the same view from
my place.
DAISY
Where’s your place?
Gatsby turns back to Nick.
65.
GATSBY
Nick, I want you and Daisy both to see my house. I’d like to show her around.
NICK
Are you sure you want me to come?
GATSBY
Absolutely, old sport. Absolutely.
EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - FRONT GATES - DAY
Servants swing open ivy-covered gates... 
GATSBY
(proudly)
I had the gates brought in from a
castle in Normandy.
REVEAL: Gatsby’s castle glistening in the sunlight.
CLOSE ON: Daisy. A delighted cry.
DAISY
Oh, Jay... !? Its so grand!
GATSBY
Do you like it?
DAISY
I love it... ! But how do you live
here all alone?
GATSBY
I don’t. I keep it always full of
interesting, celebrated people... 
As Daisy runs ahead, Gatsby murmurs to Nick.
GATSBY (CONT’D)
My house looks well doesn’t it? See how the whole front catches the light like that?
Daisy yells back... 
DAUSY
Come on you two! I want the royal
tour!
DISSOLVE TO:
66.
EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - GARDENS - DAY
Gatsby has transformed into a good-natured show-off, hurrying Nick and Daisy through a maze of fantastical gardens, past magnificent fountains and into his castle... 
INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - KITCHEN - DAY
Gatbsy shows off his brand new orange-juicer.
GATBSY
You must understand, I like all
things that are modern.
Daisy readies a cocktail shaker beneath the spout of the giant silver orange juice machine.
GATSBY
If you press this button here, the oranges shoot through here, are crushed there...  The juice of 200 oranges extracted in one hour... !
Gatsby presses, the machine groans and juice splashes out!
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. GATSBY’S BEACH - DIVING PONTOON - LATE AFTERNOON
Daisy, Nick and Gatsby drunkenly drive golf balls out toward the bay. Nick films on the world’s first home-camcorder... 
GATSBY
Its a remarkable little camera--
latest design.
While, nearby, a butler in a boat stands watch over a spinning gramophone and bottles of champagne... 
DAISY
You do know, I’m a champion golfer, don’t you? Here, I’ll show you how its done.
CRACK! Daisy cuts a marvelous swing, snapping a club in two!
She falls into Gatsby arms... 
Nick films... 
67.
GATSBY
She looks like she could be on the cover of Vogue, don’t you think... ?
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - GRAND BALLROOM - EARLY EVENING
Gatsby and Nick trail behind Daisy, crossing the ballroom.
Daisy, champagne in hand, spots the soaring ballroom organ.
DAISY
Oh... ! Its beautiful.
GATSBY
Its a custom Wurlitzer.
DAISY
Can anyone play it?
GATSBY
Klipspringer can.
(to his footmen)
Someone wake Ewing!
Daisy twirls round, overjoyed... 
DAISY
Music! And we can dance all night!
GATSBY
Ewing’s a symphonic genius, he can play anything... !
Daisy runs up the stairs and calls down... 
DAISY
Then I demand a Charleston!
Gatsby gazes up after Daisy, and confides in Nick... 
GATSBY
(as if in a dream)
She makes it look so splendid,
don’t you think old sport?
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE. GATSBY’S BEDROOM - EVENING
Nick and Daisy follow Gatsby into the bedroom... 
68.
Gatsby bounds ahead, starting up a spiral stair...  He throws open a massive cabinet, revealing a prism of suits, dressing-gowns, watches and ties.
GATSBY
I've got a man in England who buys me clothes... !
He playfully tosses Daisy a boater-hat... 
GATSBY (CONT’D)
Something for the lady... 
Then he begins yanking down shirts and tossing them over the rail to Daisy... 
DAISY
I’ve never seen anything like it!
GATSBY
He sends over a selection at the
beginning of each season... 
DAISY
Jay!
With ever-increasing enthusiasm!
GATSBY
These are silk! Linen! Indian
flannel! Egyptian cotton!
Daisy, intoxicated, leaps on the bed, arms outstretched... 
DAISY
No, Jay...  you’ll ruin them!
(to Nick)
Nicky! He’s a madman!
More and more and more shirts float down... 
The rumble of distant thunder.
CLOSE ON: Daisy. TIME SLOWS AS shirts flutter, like giant snowflakes, down toward her. Slowly, quietly, her mirth transforms to sobs...  She hides her face in shirts... 
Gatsby eases down the stairs and nestles beside Daisy, taking her tear-streaked face in his hands... 
GATSBY
What is it?
69.
DAISY
It’s just...  It makes me sad,
because... 
Daisy glances in Nick’s direction... 
GATSBY
Why?
DAISY
... because... 
A suspended moment; Daisy is incapable of speaking her heart.
NICK (V.O.)
Five lost years struggled on
Daisy’s lips. But all she could
manage was... 
DAISY
It’s just...  Because I've never seen such beautiful shirts before.
GATSBY
If it wasn't for the mist we could see the green light... 
DAISY
What green light?
GATSBY
The one that burns all night at the end of your dock.
