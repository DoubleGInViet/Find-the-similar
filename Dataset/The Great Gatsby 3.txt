As Gatsby and Daisy stare out across the bay... 
NICK (V.O.)
Possibly, it had occurred to Gatsby that the colossal significance of that light had vanished forever. Now, it was once again just a green light on a dock. His count of enchanted objects had diminished by one.
Nick, impelled to remind Daisy and Gatsby of his presence, emerges from the shadows and descends the spiral staircase.
He holds a photo of an elderly man in yachting costume... 
NICK
Who's this? Your father?
70.
GATSBY
No, no.. That’s Mr. Dan Cody, old sport...  He's dead now. He used to be my best friend years ago.
Daisy joins Nick at the bottom of the steps. In the photo
with Cody, also in yachting costume, is a young Gatsby... 
DAISY
(teases)
You never told me you had a
pompadour...  or a yacht.
Gatsby hastily plucks a scrapbook from a row on his desk... 
GATSBY
I want to show you something... 
Look, here's a lot of clippings,
about you.
They admire a scrapbook together.
DAISY
(touched)
You saved my letters... 
GATSBY
This was my first photo of you.
As Daisy flips through and pulls out an old letter of hers, we hear her reading the letter in abstract VOICEOVER:
DAISY (V.O.)
We cant lose each other and let all this glorious love end in nothing. Come home, I’ll be here waiting and hoping, for every long dream of you to come true...  Come home Jay... 
BBBRRRNNNGGG! The phone shrills.
GATSBY
Excuse me.
Gatsby crosses the room, snatches up the receiver, and turns away...  He lowers his voice.
GATSBY (INTO PHONE) (CONT’D)
Well I can't talk now old sport... 
As the timbre of Gatsby’s voice darkens we PUSH CLOSER.
GATSBY (INTO PHONE) (CONT’D)
I said a small town.
71.
ECU: Gatsby’s eyes narrow.
GATSBY (INTO PHONE) (CONT’D)
He must know what a small town is.
BOOOOMMM! A storming wind bangs open the French windows!
As Nick moves to shut them, he glimpses Gatsby... 
GATSBY (INTO PHONE) (CONT’D)
(frightening)
Well, he's no use to us if Detroit is his idea of a small town... 
Gatsby rings off abruptly, and catches Nick’s eye - a tense moment - which Gatsby banishes with that electrifying smile.
We hear the distant, jaunty sounds of a pipe organ... 
GATSBY (CONT’D)
Ah, Klipspringer! He must be awake!
Shall we?
INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - GRAND BALLROOM - DUSK BECOMING NIGHT
Daisy, wearing a flowing robe and heels, dances a Charleston with Nick.
An elaborate picnic, complete with candelabras and a mountain of cushions, is laid out on the floor. There, Gatsby sits, looking on, flush with joy.
Slowly though, Gatsby’s expression turns introspective. As he watches Daisy dance, memories flood back to him... 
DISSOLVE TO:
FLASHBACK.
AN ARRAY OF MEMORIES AND IMAGES DISSOLVE ONE INTO THE OTHER: Gatsby and Daisy, five years ago, about to kiss; a hand-written letter; a gathering storm; the green light... 
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - GRAND BALLROOM - NIGHT
Hundreds of candles flicker in patterns. As a slow, melancholic waltz plays, Gatsby and Daisy dance, enraptured... 
72.
DAISY
(whispers)
I wish I had done everything on
earth with you. All my life.
Gatsby holds her closer.
DAISY (CONT’D)
I wish that it could always be like this... 
GATSBY
It will be... 
Across the room, Nick, exhausted and drunk and unnoticed, stands to leave. At the ballroom doors he turns back and glimpses Gatsby and Daisy, in a universe all their own... 
NICK (V.O.)
If only it had been enough for
Gatbsy, just to hold Daisy... 
The towering doors close.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
Gatsby stands at his window, staring into the night.

INT. SANITARIUM - NICK’S ROOM - END OF WINTER - DUSK
Nick is writing at his desk... 
NICK (V.O.)
It wasn’t until the end of that summer, on the last night I saw Gatsby, that he told me of the life he had dreamt for himself since he was a boy... 
INT. SANITARIUM - DOCTOR’S OFFICE - END OF WINTER - DUSK
Nick stops his reading, and, very slowly, admits... 
73.
NICK
You see doctor...  Gatsby’s real
name was...  James Gatz.
DISSOLVE TO:
I/E. NORTH DAKOTA FARM HUT - DAY
PUSH TOWARD: A dilapidated hut, shrouded in a storm of dust.
NICK (V.O.)
His parents were dirt-poor farmers from North Dakota... 
DISCOVER: YOUNG GATZ, barefoot, at a dusty desk, surrounded by tattered books, strange charts, and lists. He is practicing his signature... 
NICK (V.O.)
But he never accepted them as his
parents at all.
Young Gatz turns from his writing, and looks through a hole in the roof towards the infinite heavens... 
NICK (V.O.)
In his own imagination, he was...  a
Son of God... 
CLOSE ON: The little boy looks up at CAMERA.
NICK (V.O.)
Destined for future glory... 
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. NORTH DAKOTA - PRAIRIE - NIGHT
The silhouette of TEENAGE GATZ, now 16 years old, disappears into the hills... 
NICK (V.O.)
Chasing this destiny, a sixteen

DISSOLVE TO:
74.
EXT. LAKE SUPERIOR - LATE AFTERNOON
CLOSE ON: A handsome 17 year old YOUNG GATSBY, in a torn jersey and dirty canvas pants, rowing with all his might.
NICK (V.O.)
One afternoon, off the coast of
Lake Superior, he spotted a yacht
in peril... 
Young Gatsby lets the row boat drift close to a magnificent yacht. Wind is whipping whitecaps on the bay.
NICK
He rowed out and rescued the vessel, and its captain, alcoholic millionaire Dan Cody... 
The bleary face of DAN CODY appears at the yacht’s railing.
CODY
Whadzamatta... ?
Cody is very drunk. Young Gatsby calls urgently.
YOUNG GATSBY
Sir! The shoal here’s real bad, this wind could drag you onto it... 
Cody waves a dismissive arm... 
CODY
Whaderathinkyerdoin... , old sport?
He collapses, dead drunk.
PUSH IN: On Young Gatsby; a plan forming... 
NICK (V.O.)
This was his opportunity, and he
seized it.
Springing into action, he clambers onto the yacht.
GATSBY (VOICE)
I decided right then and there to
call myself: Jay Gatsby.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. CODY’S YACHT - LATE AFTERNOON
Young Gatsby hoists the sail as the storm rages around him.

NICK (V.O.)
He sailed the yacht out of danger - and into his future... 
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. CODY’S YACHT - DAY
A perfect sunny day. Young Gatsby and Cody are sailing.
NICK (V.O.)
Gatsby showed skill and ambition, and for five years they sailed the world... 
GATSBY (VOICE)
He was alright, old Dan, he taught me everything... 
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. CLOTHING STORE - DAY
Young Gatsby, now transformed, models a suit in the mirror.
NICK (V.O.)
How to dress, act, and speak like a gentleman... 
He looks squarely at himself, and repeats a mantra.
YOUNG GATSBY
Gatsby. Jay Gatsby. A pleasure to meet you, sir. Gatsby. Jay Gatsby. Gatsby. Jay Gatsby.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. CODY’S YACHT - DAY
Young Gatsby stands at the bow, as the yacht cut across the clear blue ocean...  He turns to Cody and calls... 
YOUNG GATSBY
She looks well, doesn’t she... !?
Old sport.
HIGH AND WIDE: The yacht sails toward the golden sun... 
76.
NICK (V.O.)
Gatsby hoped to inherit Cody’s
fortune...  But when Cody died,
Gatsby was cheated out of his
inheritance by Cody’s family...  He’d been left with an ability to play the gentleman, but he was once again dirt poor.
SLAM CUT TO:
NEWSPAPER MONTAGE.
Piles and piles of New York City newspapers swirl rapidly
TOWARD CAMERA, and we read their headlines:
“GATBSY’S STAGGERING WEALTH - MONEY! MONEY! MONEY!”
NICK (V.O.)
By midsummer Gatsby was front page news... 
“GATSBY BUYING OUR CITY? INVESTMENT MONOPOLY FUELS CONCERNS”
“JAY CASHES IN! GATSBY STRIKES WALL STREET GOLD!”
“GATSBY INVESTS IN SKYSCRAPERS!”
“JAY PAYS FOR EVERYTHING: PARTIES, GALAS, PARKS, SCHOOLS!”
“WALL STREETS KING? MEET JAY GATSBY!”
A final newspaper COVERS FRAME:
“WHERE’S THE MONEY FROM!? MYSTERY MILLIONS SPARK WILD RUMORS”
We PUSH TOWARD the paper and DISSOLVE TOWARD:
EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - NIGHT
Another glittering party.
NICK (V.O.)
Where did the money comes from?
FADE IN: Decadent, grotesque images of drunken revellers... 
NICK (V.O.)
That’s what all of New York wanted to know. And it was the same question on Tom’s mind when he accompanied Daisy to one of Gatsby’s glittering parties... 
77.
DISCOVER: Gatsby leading Tom, Daisy and Nick to the top of the terrace stairs.
EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - TERRACE/DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT
GATSBY
We’ve got a great band here. Have a look around...  Excuse me... 
He turns briefly to talk to Senator Gulick... 
TOM
(mutters to Daisy)
A lot of these newly rich people
are just filthy bootleggers.
DAISY
Not Gatsby. He’s a businessman.
TOM
(snorts)
Hah! A businessman... 
DAISY
He owned a lot of drug stores.
Gatsby gracefully introduces Senator Gulick to the group... 
GATSBY
May I introduce Senator Gulick?
This is Mr. Carraway and Mrs.
Buchanan... 
DAISY
Delighted... 
GATSBY
And Mr. Buchanan... 
(a moment's hesitation)
The polo player.
TOM
(objecting quickly)
Oh no. Not me.
SENATOR GULICK
(shaking hands, nods)
Always a pleasure to meet a
Buchanan.
Gatsby bids the Senator farewell, while Tom glowers to Daisy:
78.
TOM
I’d rather not be the polo player.
DAISY
Oh Tom...  You should be proud of
your achievements.
Gatsby interjects--
GATSBY
(to the group)
May I show you around?
He guides them down the stairs... 
GATSBY (CONT’D)
You must see the faces of a lot of people you’ve heard of.
DAISY
Absolutely!
TOM
(scoffs)
We don’t go around very much. I
don’t think I recognize a single
person... 
GATSBY
Perhaps you know that lady there?
Gatsby indicates a lovely, orchid of a woman: MARLENE MOON, the silent film star.
DAISY
(taking Gatsby’s arm)
Its Marlene Moon...  I adore her
pictures... 
As Gatsby leads Daisy, we catch Tom repeating to Nick... 
TOM
I’d really rather not be the polo
player... 
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - GARDEN TABLE - NIGHT
Tom, Daisy, Nick and Gatsby sit an elaborately conceived dinner table, watching the band... 
79.
DAISY
(to Nick)
These things excite me so... 
Gatsby turns to Tom... 
GATSBY
I believe we’ve met somewhere before, Mr. Buchanan. About a month ago.
TOM
That’s right...  And you were with
Nick here. At the barbershop... 
GATSBY
That’s right. See...  I know your
wife.
TOM
Is that so?
GATSBY
Yes.
As the number subsides, and the crowd applauds, Herzog appears and addresses Gatsby with whispered intensity.
HERZOG
Mr. Gatsby sir. Mr. Slagle is
here... 
Herzog indicates SLAGLE, a dark-suited man who stands on the distant terrace with three sinister-looking 'associates'.
Gatsby, so besotted with Daisy that he cannot take his eyes off her, whispers fiercely... 
GATSBY
Not now.
Herzog silently recedes... 
A romantic foxtrot strikes up - Trimalchio introduces... 
TRIMALCHIO
And now... ! Dice, Brass Knuckles
and Guitars, with: The Foxtrot!
Gatsby turns to Tom, and gestures to Daisy... 
GATSBY
Mr. Buchanan, would you mind,
terribly?
80.
Tom does indeed look like he minds, but a group of scantily clad girls who cavort gracelessly on the other side of the garden momentarily catch his eye.
TOM
Of course not; I think I can keep
myself amused.
As Daisy takes Gatsby’s arm, she tucks a slim gold pencil into Tom’s breast pocket and murmurs... 
DAISY
In case you need to take down any
addresses... 
As Tom fumes, Gatsby leads Daisy out onto the dance floor.
PUSH CLOSE ON: Tom, growing increasingly suspicious... 
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT
As Daisy and Gatsby dance, Daisy murmurs thrillingly.
DAISY
Is all this made entirely from your own imagination?
GATSBY
No...  You see you were there all along, in every idea, in every decision...  Of course, if anything is not to your liking, we can change it... 
DAISY
It’s perfect. From your perfect,
irresistible imagination... 
EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - TERRACE - NIGHT
Tom and Nick watch Gatsby and Daisy dance. Tom looks around, perplexed by a distant thought.
TOM
I wonder where the devil he met
Daisy... ?
He notices Marlene Moon seductively, secretly watching him... 
81.
TOM (CONT’D)
(to Nick)
I’ll find you... 
He leaves Nick alone. And Nick watches as Gatsby simultaneously leads Daisy from the dance floor... 
EXT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - MAGIC TREE - NIGHT
Daisy runs ahead, playfully hurrying past the low-hanging branches of the massive tree. She disappears inside... 
Gatsby follows, but upon entering the secluded, starlit world sees no sign of Daisy.
Then, from out of the shadows, the sparkle of jewels... 
Gatsby turns, and Daisy’s lips suddenly find his.
A long, still kiss... 
EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - BAR - NIGHT
Nick is keeping watch, gazing down to his yard and the tree.
When Tom suddenly appears... 
TOM
Have you seen my wife... ?
Startled, Nick turns... 
NICK
(lies)
Ah...  no...  Not for awhile.
TOM
That’s funny. The Senator said he
saw her down here.
Tom follows Nick’s gaze down toward the tree... 
EXT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - MAGIC TREE - NIGHT
Gatsby and Daisy continue their passionate kissing... 
After a moment, Daisy whispers.
DAISY
I...  I wish we could just run away.
82.
Gatbsy is startled.
GATSBY
Run away? Darling, no. Daisy,
that...  that wouldn’t be... 
respectable.
EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - BAR - NIGHT
Tom is still looking to the tree.
TOM
(quizzically)
You live near here Nick... ?
Nick, an overwhelming sense of guilt, indicates vaguely in the direction of the tree.
NICK
Just next door.
TOM
That so... ?
EXT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - MAGIC TREE - NIGHT
Gatsby continues... 
GATSBY
We’re going to live here, in this
house, together. You and me...  Daisy...  It’s time for you to tell Tom.
EXT. GATBSY CASTLE - BAR - NIGHT
CLOSE ON: Nick, a moment of extreme tension as he fears Tom will investigate further.
SUDDENLY! Their attention is drawn to a commotion on the terrace. Glasses smash, a woman screams, and through the crowd, we see Slagle and associates causing a disturbance.
TOM
(pure disdain)
What a circus...  Well, if you see
her, I’ll be looking for her. You
tell her.
83.
EXT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - MAGIC TREE - NIGHT
The hidden lovers speak in intense, hushed tones.
DAISY
Remember how much fun we used to
have? Why can’t we just have fun
like that again?
Gatsby, frustrated, is about to speak... 
But Nick suddenly appears out of the shadows... 
Gatsby and Daisy break off, startled... 
DAISY (CONT’D)
Oh hello Nicky; we’re having a row.
NICK
What about?
Daisy glides toward him... 
DAISY
About things...  About the future... 
(trying to be funny)
The future of the Colored Empires.
NICK
Well, its Tom. He’s wandering
around the party looking for you.
Daisy flashes Gatsby an over-the-shoulder glance; when, suddenly, Herzog appears and murmurs... 
HERZOG
Sir; it’s Mr. Slagle; he’s quite... 
emotional.
A tiny, ruffled, moment; then Gatsby elegantly guides Daisy toward Nick.
GATSBY
Excuse me. Nick, would you mind?
As Gatsby follows Herzog back toward the castle... .
CLOSE ON: DAISY.

EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - DANCE FLOOR - LATER
Nick and Daisy return to a party that has become grotesque; drunken girls haphazardly bang drums... 
NICK (V.O.)
Gatsby disappeared to deal with a
dispute of some sort. Daisy
waited... 
CLOSE ON: Daisy, dejected... 
NICK
But Gatsby was unable to return.
As Daisy and Nick cross the tattered, streamer-littered dance-floor CRANE HIGH AND FADE INTO: the library window... 
INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS
Gatsby sits, solemn in an armchair; with quiet unease written in shadows across his face.
REVEAL: The ominous silhouette of Wolfsheim, pacing between Gatsby and the window; Herzog standing watch... 
We catch only a fragment of the conversation.
WOLFSHEIM
When these hot headed types appear, I rely on you...  But you were not available.. A scene was made...  What’s going on with you Jay?
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - FRONT GATE - NIGHT
HIGH SHOT: A sleek black limo winds quietly towards the gate.
CRANE DOWN TO DISCOVER: Daisy’s face through the limo window; her forlorn eyes search for Gatsby behind castle walls... 
TOM
Where were you?
DAISY
With Nicky. Mr. Gatsby was showing us the grounds.
85.
TOM
Well, he certainly must have
strained himself to get that
menagerie together... 
DAISY’S POV: Ignoring Tom, she looks back to the dark castle.
TOM (O.C.) (CONT’D)
I’d like to know who he is and what he does. And I think I’ll make a point of finding out.
As the limo passes through the gates and disappears, Slagle and associates are violently ejected by Gatsby’s “guards.”
CLOSE ON: Atop Gatsby’s gate, GATSBY’S COAT OF ARMS READS:
“Ad Finem Fidelis” (”Faithful to the End”).

EXT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - POOL - NIGHT
It is late. Agitated and intense, Gatsby paces by the pool, staring out to the green light pulsing across the bay... 
Nick descends the stairs, drunk.
NICK
Well there you are... ! Daisy just
left...  But she asked me to tell
you. She had a wonderful time... 
Gatsby is not amused.
GATSBY
She didn’t like it.
NICK
Of course she did.
GATSBY
No, she didn’t like it. She did not have a good time. I feel so far away from her now. It’s hard to make her understand.
NICK
You mean about the party?
GATSBY
The party!? I couldn’t care less
about the parties! You see... 
(shocking intensity)
(MORE)
86.
GATSBY (CONT'D)
She has to tell Tom that she never loved him.
NICK
What... ?
GATSBY
Yes. Then we can go back to Louisville, to her parents’ house - her parents are lovely people old sport - we’ll be married there... 
You see, Daisy and I are going to and start over, just as if it were five years ago.
NICK
I wouldn’t ask too much of her... 
GATSBY
Ask too much?
NICK
No.
Gatsby grows suddenly, strangely emotional. He turns his back to Nick to compose himself.
GATSBY
I beg your pardon old sport. Its just.. Its so sad because its so hard to make her understand, and--
NICK
Jay...  You can’t repeat the past.
Gatsby wheels around... 
GATSBY
Can’t repeat the past?
NICK
No.
GATSBY
Why of course you can. Of course you can. You’ll see. I am going to fix things just the way there were before. Everything’s been so...  so confused since then... 
Gatsby looks out to the green light.
87.
NICK (V.O.)
He talked a lot about the past... 
As if he wanted to recover
something... 
GATSBY
If I could just get back to the start...  If I could just get back to the start I could find it again.
NICK (V.O.)
Some vision of himself that he had put into loving Daisy...

Five years ago Gatsby found himself at Daisy’s house by colossal accident.
Amidst the many revellers, DISCOVER: Daisy, hurrying through the crowd.
GATSBY (BY THE POOL)
I went to her house first with some of the other officers from Camp Taylor...  I’d never been in such a beautiful house before... 
Daisy rushes up the steps, and looks back... 
At the bottom of the steps, smiling up, is: THE OBJECT OF HER AFFECTION, Young Gatsby in officer’s uniform.
NICK (V.O.)
But his uniform his the truth. That he was a penniless young man with only that grand vision of himself.
Daisy’s Mother stops her on the steps.

Checking to make sure no one has seen, Daisy slips quietly through a set of doors, into the conservatory...  Gatsby is not far behind...  A secret rendezvous.

GATSBY (BY THE POOL)
I waited for a moment longer.
He looks out the dark, crystal windows, beyond the trees... 
to a staircase of moonlight, climbing up, up, up... 
NICK (V.O.)
He knew that if he kissed this girl his mind would never again be free to romp like...  the mind of God...  That falling in love would change

I knew it was a great mistake for a man like me to fall in love. A great mistake. I’m only 32...  I might still be a great man if I could only forget that I once lost Daisy. But my life, old sport, my life has got to be like this... 
He draws a slanting line from the lawn to the stars.

GATSBY (CONT’D)
It’s got to keep going up.
Gatsby looks to the green light.
GATSBY (CONT’D)
She has to go to Tom and tell him she never loved him...  I need to give her more time. I just need to give her more time... 
He turns to Nick, reassuring both of them.
GATSBY (CONT’D)
Don’t worry old sport, don’t worry. I can protect her here. Good night old sport... 
Gatsby heads for his castle, and turns and calls...

Yes...  Daisy and I are very much in love.
NICK (O.S.)
I hear you fired all your servants?

Daisy comes over sometimes in the afternoons and I wanted some people who wouldn’t gossip...  until we decided what we’re going to do... 
You see these two towns are pretty close together. And it gets in the papers...  You understand?

They’re some people Wolfsheim

Tom stands and strolls to the open French window... 
TOM (CONT’D)
The sun is getting colder every
year... 
Daisy grips a wine glass in her trembling hand; her eyes are terrified, perspiration forms on her upper lip. She glances to Gatsby, who stares resolutely from across the table.
CLOSE ON: A perspiring Nick. He glances from Daisy to Gatsby.
The tension is excruciating.
Out the window Tom catches sight of a sailboat across the bay.
TOM (CONT’D)
How I’d like to be out on that bay today.
CLOSE ON: Gatsby. He looks up. Beyond the sailboat, he can see the outline of his castle.
GATSBY
I’m right across from you.
(points)
Right there.
TOM
(unimpressed)
So you are.
Gatsby slowly stands and walks behind Daisy.
GATSBY
Every night I can see that light at the end of your dock, blinking.
TOM
What light?
Gatsby gently moves his hand over Daisy’s... 
GATSBY
You see, Mr. Buchanan, I wanted to be close-- Daisy and I--
With sudden intensity Daisy stands!
95.
DAISY
(on the verge of tears)
It's so hot... 
Agitated, she sweeps toward the sideboard.
DAISY (CONT’D)
Everything's so confused.
She plucks a cigarette from a carved box, and fumbles with the paperweight-sized lighter.
DAISY (CONT’D)
What'll we do with ourselves this
afternoon... ? And the day after
that... 
(she snaps it again)
... and for the next thirty years?
(turns suddenly)
Let’s all go to town! Who wants to go to town?
Her nervous hands drop the lighter, which crashes to the mahogany floor. All but Tom recoil in shock.
TOM
Town!? Women...  They get these
notions... 
Gatsby walks to Daisy...  As Tom puffs, Gatsby retrieves the lighter in one hand, and with his other gently guides Daisy’s trembling hand...  In that moment, their eyes tenderly meet... 
GATSBY
(whispers)
Daisy... 
DAISY
(as if they are alone)
You look so cool. You always look so cool, like the advertisement of the man...  in Times Square... 
CLOSE ON: Tom, his jaw tightening.
DAISY (CONT’D)
The man in the cool, beautiful,
shirts.
CAMERA FLOATS TOWARD TOM...  He violently snuffs his cigar.
NICK (V.O.)
She had told Gatsby that she loved him - and Tom had seen... 
96.
SUDDENLY Tom explodes!
TOM
Let’s go to town! I’m perfectly
willing... ! That’s a marvelous
idea! Henri! Have the car brought
around immediately!
DAISY
Just like that? Can’t anyone at
least have a cigarette?
TOM
We’ve smoked all through lunch.
DAISY
Oh, let's have fun. It's too hot to fuss.
TOM
It was your great idea Daisy. Why
don’t we!? We’ll all go to town!
Daisy doesn’t budge.
DAISY
I’ve changed my mind... 
(teases)
You brute.
TOM
(a dangerous intensity) You’ve got me all excited, and now you don’t want to go? We’ll get a great big room at the Plaza, a cold bucket of ice, and some whiskey...  It will be fun.
DAISY
Fine. Have it your own way, Tom... 
Come on, Jordan.
As she and Jordan rush past Tom, down the hall, Tom turns calmly to Gatsby.
TOM
Will you join us, Mr. Gatsby?
Then turns and calls to Henri... 
97.
TOM (CONT’D)
Henri! Get some whiskey! Two
bottles, wrapped in a towel.
CUT TO:
EXT. BUCHANAN MANSION - DAY
CLOSE ON: Shoes shifting on gravel. Gatsby and Nick stand uncomfortably on the drive, waiting for Tom and the women.
BANG! Tom storms out wrapping a quart bottle in a towel.
Daisy and Jordan follow.
TOM
Mr. Gatsby! Would you be good enough to take my coupé? And I’ll drive everyone else in your circus wagon.
GATSBY
I don’t think there’s much gas, old sport.
Gatsby looks to Daisy, a burning stare.
TOM
(looks at the gauge)
Plenty of gas. And if we run out,
then we’ll stop at a drug store.
I hear you can buy anything at a
drug store nowadays... 
(savagely eyes Gatsby)
Isn’t that right, Mr. Gatsby?
A moment of sharp tension; Daisy wrenches from Tom’s arm.
DAISY
You take Nick and Jordan, Tom!
She slips quickly into the coupé... 
DAISY (CONT’D)
We’ll meet you at the Plaza! I’ll
be the man on the corner smoking
two cigarettes... 
Gatsby’s and Tom’s eyes flash; a harsh, competitive glance.
Tom lunges into the Duesenberg, slams the gears and lurches away, leaving Gatsby, Daisy, and the coupé in the dust.
98.
I/E. GATSBY’S CAR - LONG ISLAND COUNTRYSIDE - DAY
Tom throttles forward, watching Jordan and Nick... 
TOM
You think I'm pretty dumb, don't you? But I have a-- an almost second sight, sometimes, that tells me what to do. And I’ve made a small investigation of this fellow.
JORDAN
(condescending)
And you found he was an Oxford man?
TOM
Oxford, New Mexico! He wears a pink suit for Christ's sake!
With that, Tom shifts gears and the Duesenberg rockets on!
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. THE VALLEY OF ASHES - DAY
HIGH AND WIDE: The Duesenberg tears into the Valley... 
JORDAN (O.C.)
(mocking)
We’re almost out of gas Tom... 
EXT. THE VALLEY OF ASHES - WILSON’S GARAGE - DAY
SCRREEECH! Tom slams the breaks and the Duesenberg slides to a stop at Wilson’s... 
Wilson doesn’t budge. He’s staring with sickly eyes at the giant billboard of Dr. T. J. Eckleberg.
TOM
Wilson! Wilson! What are you
waiting for!? Let’s have some
gas... 
(gets out)
Do I have to do it myself?
WILSON
I’m sick. I’m all run down. I need money bad...  My wife and I want to go West.
99.
TOM
Your wife does... ?
Tom glances up to the window above the garage. Myrtle’s face,
badly bruised, stares back. Tom clocks this, and hesitates... 
NICK (V.O.)
Tom was feeling the hot whips of
panic. His mistress and wife, an
hour ago so secure, were both
slipping from his control... 
WILSON
I just got wised-up to something funny the last two days. She's goin’ whether she wants to or not.
Tom isn’t listening...  He sees the coupe approaching at high-speed, threatening to leave him in the dust!
TOM
What do I owe you!?
WILSON
Dollar twenty.
The blue coupé flashes by. Tom glances back to Myrtle...  And then jumps into the Duesenberg.
TOM
You can have the car! I'll send it around tomorrow!
He throws coins into the dirt for Wilson to collect. Then he floors the gas and peels out after the coupé!
I/E. GATSBY’S CAR/TOM’S COUPÉ - DAY
VRRROOMM! The cars roar neck-and-neck, veering, swerving and skidding PERILOUSLY close.
As Tom and Gatsby shoot dangerous glances at one another,
Daisy waves carefree back to Tom... .
PAN UP: The cars tear over the Queensboro Bridge, toward the glimmering, golden city... 
SLAM CUT TO:
100.
INT. PLAZA HOTEL. SUITE - DAY
CRACK! CRACK! CRACK! Shards of ice spilt off from a hunk as a bell-boy makes ice-cubes... 
TOM
That’s enough... 
The room is large and stifling hot, it has been filled with huge ice buckets in an attempt to cool it. Gatsby, Tom, Nick, Daisy and Jordan are bathed in a thin sheen of perspiration.
DAISY
Open another window.
NICK
There aren't any more.
DAISY
Then telephone for an axe... 
TOM
Forget about the heat. You make it worse by crabbing about it.
GATSBY
Why not let her alone, old sport?
TOM
That's a great expression of yours, isn't it?
GATSBY
What is?
Tom turns to Gatsby... 
TOM
'Old sport'. Where'd you pick it
up?
DAISY
Now see here, Tom; if you're going to make personal remarks I won't stay here one minute.
Gatsby's foot beats a restless tattoo; Tom eyes him suddenly.
TOM
Mr. Gatsby, I understand you're an
Oxford man.
GATSBY
No, not exactly.
101.
TOM
Oh yes, I understand you went to
Oxford.
GATSBY
Yes - I went there.
Tom's laugh is incredulous and insulting.
TOM
Sure; the man in the pink suit went to Oxford!
DAISY
Tom... !
Gatsby stands.
GATSBY
(slow, intense)
I told you I went there.
TOM
I heard you, but I'd like to know
when.
GATSBY
You’d like to know when... .? It was
in nineteen-nineteen, I only stayed five months. That's why I can't exactly call myself an Oxford man.
Tom glances around to see if the others mirror his disbelief.
But they are all looking at Gatsby.
GATSBY (CONT’D)
You see, it was an opportunity they gave to some of the officers who actually fought in the war.
Nick can’t help but smile.
NICK (V.O.)
I wanted to get up and slap Gatsby on the back.
DAISY
I'll make you a drink Tom, then you won't seem so stupid to yourself... 
But Tom’s not done yet.
102.
TOM
Wait a minute, I want to ask Mr.
Gatsby one more question.
GATSBY
Go on. Please Mr. Buchanan, go on.
TOM
What kind of a row are you trying
to cause in my house anyhow?
They are out in the open at last and Gatsby is content.
DAISY
He isn't causing a row; you're causing a row. Please have a little self-control!
TOM
Self-control! I suppose the latest
thing is to sit back and let Mr.
Nobody from Nowhere make love to
your wife? Well, if that's the idea
you can count me out...  See,
nowadays people begin by sneering
at family life and family
institutions and next you know
they'll throw everything overboard
and we’ll have intermarriage
between black and white!
JORDAN
We’re all white here, Tom.
GATSBY
Your wife doesn't love you. She's
never loved you. She loves me!
TOM
You must be crazy.
GATSBY
No, old sport. See, she never loved you...  She only married you because I was poor and she was tired of waiting. It was a terrible, terrible mistake, but in her heart she never loved anyone but me!
JORDAN
We should go... 
GATSBY
Daisy and I have nothing to hide... 
103.
DAISY
Jay let’s go, please... !
TOM
Sit down Daisy!
GATSBY
(reassuring)
Yes, Daisy, please sit down.
