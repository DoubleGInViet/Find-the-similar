Tom's voice gropes unsuccessfully for the paternal note.
TOM
What's been going on? I want to
hear all about it.
GATSBY
I just told you what's been going
on; its been going on for five
years... !
Tom turns to Daisy sharply.
TOM
You've been seeing him for five
years?
GATSBY
Not seeing. No, we couldn't; but both of us loved each other all that time, old sport, and you didn't know. I used to laugh sometimes, to think that you didn't know... 
TOM
Oh - that's all; you're crazy! I
can't speak about what happened
five years ago, because I didn't
know Daisy then - but I'll be
damned if I see how you got within
a mile of her unless you brought
the groceries to the back door. But
all the rest of that's a god-damned
lie. Daisy loved me when she
married me and she loves me now.
Tom starts to make himself a drink... 
GATSBY
No... 
104.
TOM
She does, though...  And what's more, I love Daisy too. Once in a while I go off on a spree, but I always come back, and in my heart I love her all the time... 
DAISY
You’re revolting... 
Daisy’s voice drops an octave lower, filling the room with thrilling scorn... 
DAISY (CONT’D)
Do you know why we left Chicago... ? I'm surprised they didn't treat you to the story of that little spree.
Gatsby walks over and stands beside Daisy.
GATSBY
That's all over now. Just tell him the truth, that you never loved him; and all this...  all this pain will be wiped out forever.
Daisy looks at Gatsby blindly.
DAISY
Why, how could I love him,
possibly?
GATSBY
You never loved him.
Daisy hesitates; too late, she realizes what she is doing.
DAISY
I never loved him.
GATSBY
That’s right... 
TOM
Not at Kapiolani?
DAISY
No.
TOM
(a husky tenderness)
Not that day I carried you down
from the Punch Bowl to keep your
shoes dry... ? Daisy? Never?
105.
DAISY
Please don’t.
TOM
Daisy... 
Her voice is cold, but the anger is gone.
DAISY
There, Jay.
She trembles as she looks to Gatsby... 
DAISY (CONT’D)
You want too much! I love you now; isn't that enough? I can't help what's past.
(begins to sob)
I did love him once; but I loved
you too.
GATSBY
(shocked, uncomprehending)
You loved me too?
TOM
(savage)
Even that's a lie. She didn't know you were alive. There are things between Daisy and me that you'll never know, things that neither of us can ever forget.
The words seem to bite physically into Gatsby.
GATSBY
I want to speak to Daisy alone.
She's all excited now... 
DAISY
Even alone I can't say I never
loved Tom. It wouldn't be true.
TOM
Of course it wouldn't.
Daisy turns to her husband.
DAISY
As if it mattered to you.
106.
TOM
Of course it matters. I'm going to take better care of you from now on.
GATSBY
You're not taking care of her any
more! Daisy's leaving you.
TOM
Nonsense.
DAISY
(with visible effort)
I am, though.
TOM
She's not leaving me; and certainly not for a common swindler!
Tom's words suddenly lean down over Gatsby.
TOM (CONT’D)
Mr. Gatsby, who exactly are you
anyhow? You see, I have made a
small investigation into your
affairs...  You're one of Meyer
Wolfsheim’s bunch.
Tom turns to the others and speaks rapidly.
TOM (CONT’D)
See, he and this Wolfsheim bought up a lot of 'drug stores' and sold bootlegged alcohol over the counter!
GATSBY
What about it, old sport?
TOM
Don’t call me ‘old sport!’ This drug store business is just small change compared to the bonds stunt you and Wolfsheim have got going on now.
GATSBY
Well your friend Walter Chase isn’t too proud to come in on it.
107.
TOM
I’ve been giving that some thought. How does a reputable banker like Walter Chase find himself up to his eyeballs in debt to a little kike like Wolfsheim?
GATSBY
It’s called ‘greed,’ old sport.
TOM
That’s right; you’ve got half of Wall Street out there swilling your free booze at that fun park every weekend... 
(to Nick)
I’m surprised he hasn’t tried to
drag you in... 
Nick looks away sharply. Tom registers this.
TOM (CONT’D)
My God, he has... 
GATSBY
He’s got nothing to do with--
TOM
With your little racket... 
(to Daisy)
Daisy...  Can’t you see who this guy is? With his house and his parties and his fancy clothes; he’s just a front for Wolfsheim, a gangster, to get his claws into respectable folk like Walter... !
GATSBY
(a vicious sneer)
The only respectable thing about
you, old sport, is your money,
that’s it, and now I’ve just as
much as you; so that means we’re
equal!!
Tom smiles with smug, condescending scorn.
TOM
Oh no, no, we’re different; I am,
(gesturing at Nick and
Jordan)
They are... 
(now at Daisy)
She is;
(MORE)
108.
TOM (CONT'D)
we’re all different from you - we were born different, it’s in our blood, and nothing you do, or say, or steal or dream up, can ever change that...  And a girl like Daisy will never... !
Gatsby explodes with terrifying rage.
GATSBY
SHUT UP! SHUT UP! SHUTTT UP!!!!
Shock jolts the room. We float toward Gatsby. His rage-filled eyes stare into the void, as, with all his willpower, he restrains himself from ripping Tom apart... 
NICK (V.O)
Gatsby looked, in that moment...  as if he had “killed a man.”
Tom snorts a dismissive laugh.
TOM
That’s right Mr. Gatsby, show us
those fine Oxford manners... 
Gatsby recovers and turns to Diasy, who is trembling in the corner, on the verge of tears.
DAISY
My sincerest apologies. I...  I seem to have lost my temper.
Struggling for self control, Gatsby turns toward her as if Tom suddenly no longer exists.
GATSBY
Daisy darling...  None of this has
any consequence. Don’t listen to
him Daisy.
Daisy blanches; Gatsby, now desperate, babbles incoherently.
GATSBY (CONT’D)
We’re going back to Louisville to be married. Then we’re going to live together in our house; it’s--
There is a feeling of excruciating unease in the room.
CLOSE ON: Nick.
109.
NICK (V.O.)
He began talking excitedly, denying everything...  But with every word Daisy was drawing further and further into herself, until only the dead dream fought on... 
DAISY
Please Tom; I can't stand this
anymore!
Daisy is staring, terrified, courage gone; she looks to Tom.
TOM
You two start on home... 
(to Gatsby)
In Mr. Gatsby's car.
Daisy is alarmed now.
TOM (CONT’D)
Go on. He won't annoy you. I think he realizes that his little flirtation...  is over.
Daisy, hysterical, runs from the room; Gatsby pursues her.
GATSBY
Daisy... !
Daisy and Gatsby are gone. A terrible silence fills the room.
Tom begins wrapping the unopened whiskey bottle in the towel.
TOM
Want any of this? Jordan? Nick?
Nick?
NICK
What?
TOM
Want any?
NICK
No...  I just remembered - today's
my birthday. I’m thirty.
Tom mutters as he pours himself a drink... 
TOM
Happy birthday... 
Nick is staring out the window, lost in thought... 
110.
NICK (V.O.)
Thirty - the promise of a decade of
loneliness... 
NICK’S POV: To the setting sun and the Queensboro Bridge... 
NICK (V.O.)
The formidable stroke of thirty
died away, as Gatsby and Daisy
drove on through the cooling
twilight, towards death... 
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. WILSON’S BEDROOM - TWILIGHT
MYRTLE FLIES PAST CAMERA as Wilson drags her across the room!
WILSON
God knows everything you've been
doing!
Grabbing his wife’s hair he presses her face to the window.
WILSON (CONT’D)
You might fool me but you can't
fool God!
OVER WILSON’S SHOULDER, we see with shock, that he is looking at the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleberg.
WILSON (CONT’D)
God sees everything!
Below the Eckleberg sign a train thunders through the level crossing.
The final carriage clears to reveal Gatsby’s yellow car waiting on the other side of the crossing.
CLOSE ON: Myrtle seeing the yellow car; a desperate whisper.
MYRTLE
(thinking its Tom)
He’s here... 
WHACK! Myrtle gives a sudden backhand to Wilson’s face as she twists from his grasp!
CUT TO:

Standing outside his restaurant, the owner, MICHAELIS sees Myrtle rush out of the garage shouting hysterically.
MYRTLE
Stop, Tom, please, stop!
I/E. GATSBY’S CAR - CONTINUOUS
SUDDENLY! Myrtle appears in the headlights of Gatsby’s car... 
ECU: The sleeve of the pink suit and the 'Daisy' signet ring, as Gatsby’s hand on the wheel tries to veer away... !
GATSBY
No... !
BUT the car STRIKES Myrtle!
SLOW MOTION, TERRIBLE, NIGHTMARISH, EXPRESSIONISTIC IMAGES: Glass shattering, blood splattering, Daisy screaming, Myrtle’s body flying through the air, her pearls showering the night like a thousand new stars... 
THUMP. Her torn open body hits the ground.
CLOSE ON: The giant billboard, the towering eyes of Dr. T.J.
Eckleberg, watching everything... 
DISSOLVE THROUGH THE WHITES OF THE EYES TO:
INT. TOM’S COUPÉ - NIGHT
CLOSE ON: The coupe’s blinding headlights.
As the coupé nears, Nick, Tom and Jordan see the commotion.
TOM
Wreck... ! Good. Wilson will have a little business at last...  Let’s take a look..
JORDAN
Must we?
TOM
Just a look.
112.
INT. WILSON’S GARAGE - NIGHT
The dim garage is lit only by a swinging yellow globe.
Wilson stands on the raised threshold of his office, swaying and wailing a high, horrible call.
WILSON
O, my Ga-od! O, my Ga-od!
A crush of gawking spectators speak in hushed tones.
CUT TO: Tom pushing through the crowd.
CLOSE ON: He stops, and makes a harsh sound... 
MYRTLE’S BODY, wrapped in a blanket, lies on a work table.
Tom bends over it, shocked, motionless.
CUT TO: Nick, watching Tom’s reaction.
A POLICEMAN stands next to Tom taking down names.
POLICEMAN
(to Tom)
Sir. Sir, I’m gonna have to ask you to step away--
TOM
Get off me... !
(regains his composure)
I’m fine. I’m fine.
POLICEMAN
You knew her?
TOM
(a long pause)
No...  Not really... 
POLICEMAN
Well then I have to ask you to step back.
TOM
What happened... ?
POLICEMAN
She ran out ‘inna road. Son-of-a-
bitch didn't even stopus car.
A well-dressed African American man steps near.
113.
WELL-DRESSED MAN
I saw it! It was a yellow car; big yellow car.
CUT TO: Tom; a slow realization.
PUSH IN: On Nick; a disbelieving horror.
The Greek restaurant owner MICHAELIS pipes up.
MICHAELIS
Yeah, a big yellow duezy; custom
job.
Some of this conversation has reached Wilson; suddenly sighting Tom, he moves toward him with a cry... 
WILSON
You don't have to tell me what kind of car it was! I know what kind of car it was!
Tom, realizing the danger, moves quickly and seizes Wilson.
TOM
(a soothing gruffness)
Pull yourself together... 
Wilson, distraught, almost collapses, but Tom holds him upright and pushes him into:
INT. WILSON’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Tom sets Wilson down and whispers intensely.
TOM
Listen, I just got here from New York. I was bringing you the coupé. That yellow car wasn't mine, do you hear? I haven't seen it all afternoon.
The policeman follows and turns suspiciously to Tom.
POLICEMAN
What color's your car?
TOM
Blue, a coupé; we've come straight from New York.
MICHAELIS
Yeah, they just stopped... 
114.
The policeman accepts, suspicious still... 
POLICEMAN
Alright...  Blue.
In the relative calm of the office, Wilson’s clouded, desperate eyes look up at Tom.
WILSON
Who owns the yella’ car... ?
TOM
(a tiny pause)
Fella named Gatsby; he’s a crook, George. Gives those parties the papers are always talking about... 
WILSON
Maybe he was the one foolin’ with Myrtle; maybe that’s why he killed her... ?
TOM
Yeah. Maybe. Guy like that, who
knows... 
Wilson starts sobbing again.
WILSON
Oh, Ga-od! Oh, my Ga-od!
He rests his head on Tom’s shoulder... 
Tom consoles Wilson and then whispers... 
TOM
Gatsby. Something outta be done
about a fella like that. He’ll
pay...  Oh, he’ll pay...

The goddamn coward didn't even stop his car... 
Jordan and Nick sit silently beside Tom; he turns to them, triumphantly accusing...

TOM (CONT’D)
You gonna defend him now, huh?
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. BUCHANAN MANSION - NIGHT
The coupe drifts slowly up the drive.
EXT. BUCHANAN MANSION - NIGHT
As they walk up the stone staircase, Tom disposes of the situation in a few brisk phrases.
TOM
I'll telephone for a taxi, Nick. Come in and have some supper while you wait... 
Tom opens the door.
NICK
No thanks. I'll wait outside.
Tom stares at Nick, absorbing his disdain.
TOM
What is the matter with you?
Tom snorts and goes in; Jordan puts her hand on Nick’s arm.
JORDAN
Won't you come in, Nick?
NICK
No...  thanks.
JORDAN
It's only half past nine... 
NICK
No. I think I’ve had enough...  Of
everyone.
CLOSE ON: Jordan; she gives Nick a long, hurt look... 
But Nick stares decisively back; after a moment he turns
sharply and walks off. Dejected, Jordan sweeps inside... 
116.
EXT. BUCHANAN MANSION - NIGHT
As Nick’s feet crunch upon the white gravel of the drive, he is startled by a voice from the shadows... 
GATSBY
Hello old sport... 
Cautiously, Nick approaches the hedge. The closer he gets the more certain he becomes: Gatsby is hiding, just below Daisy’s window. His pace quickens.
NICK
What are you doing!?
GATSBY
Just sitting here... 
NICK
Yes, I can see that.
GATSBY
Did you see any trouble out on the road?
NICK
Trouble!? That woman you ran down
is dead Jay!
GATSBY
I thought so...  I told Daisy I
thoughts so--
NICK
Daisy? Do you hear yourself--
GATSBY
Its better that the shock should
come all at once--
NICK
What’s wrong with you!? How could
you!?
GATSBY
Please...  Keep your voice down, old sport.
NICK
Tom was right! You’re nothing but a goddamn coward!
117.
GATSBY
(threatening)
Keep your voice down...  There. Was.
No. Point. In. Stopping.
NICK
NO POINT!?
GATSBY
It, it killed her instantly. I--
NICK
Yes, I was there. I saw! It ripped her open!
Panicked, Gatsby grabs Nick, trying to explain... 
GATSBY
I understand-- It was...  my fault. This woman just rushed out, as if she wanted to speak to us...  It all happened so quickly. She-- I...  tried-- to turn the wheel.
NICK
She?
SUDDENLY! The CREAK of a door opening. A shaft of light... 
Henri emerges.
AN INTERMINABLE moment. Gatsby and Nick hold their breaths.
Finally, Henri goes back in.
CLOSE ON: Nick, a realization.
NICK (CONT’D)
It was Daisy?
Finally, and very slowly, Gatsby admits.
GATSBY
You see, after we left New York, she was very nervous. She thought driving would steady her. But this woman, she just rushed out at us.
CUT TO: We replay the violent accident, this time fully REVEALING that it was Daisy behind the wheel... 
GATSBY (CONT’D)
It all happened so quickly. It
wasn’t her fault... 
(MORE)
118.
GATSBY (CONT’D)
It was my fault. I should have
taken the wheel... 
(intense)
No one must know. Promise me. No
one. Promise me.
NICK
Jay-- You shouldn’t be here. You
should get out of here.
Gatsby gazes back to the house... 
GATSBY
No. No. No. I’m going to wait. I’ll wait all night if necessary. You see, Daisy’s locked herself in her room, and she’s going to turn her light off and on again if he tries to bother her about that unpleasantness this afternoon. If he tries ANY brutality whatsoever--
NICK
Tom won't touch her. He’s not even thinking about her... 
GATSBY
Oh, I don't trust him, old sport. I don’t trust him.
Nick considers the light at the end of the terrace.
NICK
Alright. Alright...  You wait here.
I’ll see if there’s any commotion.
GATSBY
Would you do that for me? Thank
you. Thank you, old sport.
EXT. BUCHANAN MANSION - TERRACE - NIGHT
Nick skirts the terrace... 
Rounding the corner, Nick, unseen in the shadows, can see Tom and Daisy sitting at one end of the vast dining table, a plate of cold chicken and two bottles of ale between them.
As Tom speaks intently and earnestly at Daisy, his hand falls gently upon hers and she nods tiredly in agreement... 
TOM
Its going to be all right... 
119.
Then, very slowly, Daisy lays her head on Tom’s shoulder.
CLOSE ON: Nick, shocked...  angry.

Nick appears, coming across the yard.
NICK
Jay? Everything alright... ?
Exhausted, Gatsby turns... 
GATSBY
Oh, hello, old sport. Yes, yes,
everything’s just fine...  About
four o'clock she came to the
window; she stood there...  Then,
well, she turned out the light... 
So... 
(beckons to the car)
Give me a hand will you old sport?
CLOSE ON: Nick.
NICK (V.O.)
I should have told him what I had
just seen. But all I could manage
was... 
NICK
Jay...  You oughtta go away.
He helps Gatsby cover the car.
NICK (CONT’D)
Tonight. They’ll trace your car.
GATSBY
(as if Nick is crazy)
Go away? I can’t leave now. Not
tonight.
120.
NICK
Do you understand that a woman has been killed--?
Nick follows him from the garage toward the house.
GATSBY
Daisy’s going to call in the morning. Then we’ll make plans, to go away together.
NICK
But Jay she--
Sensing Nick’s tone, Gatsby cuts him off and banishes all doubt with intense certainty.
GATSBY
She just needs time to think... 
(he continues, calm)
She’ll call. In the morning. She
just needs time to think.
NICK
Jay--
GATSBY
She just needs to think. She’s
going to call in the morning.
Gatsby smiles that smile of endless possibility... 
He turns to go in but stops.
GATSBY (CONT’D)
Wait up with me? The suns almost

NICK (V.O.)
That was the night he finally told me the truth. All of it.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - MAPROOM - NIGHT
Gatsby’s voice echoes through the empty halls of his vast, lonely mansion as he confesses... 
GATSBY
You know, I thought for awhile I
had a lot of things...  But the
truth is...  I’m empty.
(MORE)
121.
GATSBY (CONT'D)
I suppose that’s why I make things up about myself...  But I‘ve wanted to tell you the whole story for a long time...  You see. I grew up, terribly, terribly poor, old sport. My folks were, well--
As Gatbsy continues, Nick’s V.O. FADES UP:
NICK (V.O.)
He revealed his humble beginnings, his transformative voyage with Dan Cody, the war, Oxford, and how he’d joined Wolfsheim in the business... 
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - WHARF - PRE-DAWN
In the silvery pre-dawn, Nick and Gatsby trail slowly toward the end of the dock.
NICK (V.O.)
It was also that night that I
became aware of Gatsby’s... 
extraordinary gift for hope.
GATSBY
... I can't describe to you how surprised I was to find out that I loved her, old sport. And that she loved me too.
NICK (V.O.)
A gift that I have never found in
any other person... 
GATSBY
I never realized just how extraordinary a nice girl could be.
NICK (V.O.)
And which it is not likely I shall ever find again.
GATSBY
I thought out my life with Daisy in it, trying to figure out how we could marry and struggle along on so many dollars a month... 
Finally, Nick is able to ask:
122.
NICK
What was in the letter?
Gatsby reaches the end of the wharf and looks to the green light across the bay... 
GATSBY
The truth, the reason why after the war, I hadn’t been able to return--
In the clouds overhead, the IMAGE OF DAISY, in the bathtub with the DISSOLVING LETTER...  And now, we can see what Gatsby wrote in that fateful, last letter: “Daisy, the truth is...  I’m penniless.”
GATSBY (O.C.) (CONT’D) I asked her to wait until I’d made something of myself. But-- She was young, there was so much pressure.
The IMAGE of Daisy fades... 
GATSBY (CONT’D)
You see, I felt married to her... 
That was all.
NICK (V.O.)
It had all been for her. The house the parties, everything.

HERZOG
A personal call? Of course.
The GARDENER comes to the foot of the steps.
GARDENER
I'm going to drain the pool today,
Mr. Gatsby.
GATSBY
Not today. It’s so beautiful.
(to Nick)
You know, old sport, I've never
used that pool all summer?
Gatsby enthusiastically heads down the stairs... 
GATSBY (CONT’D)
Let’s go for a swim. I’ll have the phone transferred to the pool... 
As Gatsby heads toward the pool, Nick checks his watch... 
NICK
Jay, I’ve got to go. I have to
work.
GATSBY
I understand...  Well, I’ll walk you out.
Gatsby leads Nick toward the side gate. At the gate... 
NICK
I'll call you up.
GATSBY
Do, old sport, please do.
(a thought)
I suppose Daisy'll call too.
NICK
I suppose so...  Well...  Goodbye.
Nick lingers...  Then they shake hands and he starts away.
Just before he reaches the hedge he turns back and calls:
124.
NICK (CONT’D)
They're a rotten crowd! You're
worth the whole damn bunch put

First Gatsby nods politely, and then his face breaks into that radiant and understanding smile.

NICK (V.O.)
They were careless people, Tom and Daisy. They smashed up things and people and then retreated back into their money and their vast carelessness... 
He looks to the throng of press swarming like vultures around Gatsby’s casket. Seized by fury, he snaps and screams as he advances down the stairs!
NICK
GET OUT! ALL OF YOU OUT! GET
OUT... !!!
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - GRAND BALLROOM - NIGHT
Time has passed. Nick sits on the steps slouched against the rail. He looks down to Gatsby’s still face, sad, alone... 
NICK (V.O.)
I rang, I wrote, I implored... 
THE CAMERA PUSHES SLOWLY DOWN TOWARD GATSBY:
129.
NICK (V.O.)
But not a single one of the sparkling hundreds who had enjoyed his hospitality all summer, attended the funeral... 
ECU: Gatsby.
NICK (V.O.)
And from Daisy, not even a flower.
Distraught and exhausted, Nick’s eyes slowly close... 
NICK (V.O.)
I was all he had; the only one who cared... 
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. SANITARIUM - DOCTOR’S OFFICE - SUMMER - MORNING
Nick is sound asleep on the couch, his typewriter and dozens of type-filled pages in front of him. Clearly, he has been writing all night... 
The Doctor enters. He looks tenderly to Nick, and picks up a loose page from the floor... 
DISSOLVE THROUGH THE PAGE TO:
EXT. NEW YORK CITY - DAY
Its winter now.
The city is blanketed by an unforgiving, cold grey sky... 
NICK (V.O.)
After Gatsby's death, New York was haunted for me... 
DISCOVER: Nick, a tumult of anger, grief and despair, wandering unshaven through a Fifth Avenue crowd... 
NICK (V.O.)
That city...  My once golden... 
shimmering mirage, now made me
sick.
DISSOLVE TO:
130.
EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - FRONT GATES - EVENING
DRIFT TOWARD: Gatsby’s castle, ghostly in the moonlight.
NICK (V.O.)
On my last night in New York...  I
returned to that huge, incoherent
house once more.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - NIGHT
Very drunk, Nick trails over broken relics of lost grandeur, through rooms that have been stripped... 
NICK (V.O.)
Wolfsheim’s 'associates' had
cleaned the place out... 
ALL AROUND NICK: Ghostly images from Nick’s memory - from all those glittering parties, haunting snatches of music, laughter and conversation, imagery - mixing and FADING IN AND OUT... 
JORDAN
He threw all those parties hoping
she would wander in one night... 
NICK
Its like an amusement park... 
DAISY
But how do you live her all alone?
GATSBY
She makes it look so splendid,
don’t you think, old sport?
DAISY
Music! And then we can dance all
night... 
GATSBY
Will you come old sport? We...  need you.
DAISY
I wish it could always be like
this... 
131.
GATSBY
It will be... 
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - TERRACE - NIGHT
Nick wanders out as a light rain beings to fall.
NICK (V.O.)
I remembered how we had all come to Gatsby’s, and guessed at his corruption...  While he had stood before us concealing an incorruptible dream... 
A FINAL MEMORY: Gatsby and Daisy together on the dance-floor...  Daisy leans in and whispers happily to Gatsby... 
DAISY
Its perfect...  From your perfect,
irresistible imagination.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - WHARF - NIGHT
Nick stumbles along the dock; the rain falling steadily now.
NICK (V.O.)
The moon rose higher...  And as I
stood there, brooding on the old,
unknown world, I thought of
Gatsby's wonder when he first
picked out the green light at the
end of Daisy's dock.
Nick looks to the end of the dock, where he first saw Gatsby that warm summer night... 
NICK (V.O.)
He had come such a long way... 
And suddenly, shimmering ghostly through the rain, Gatsby’s silhouette can be seen once more, gazing out across the bay.
NICK (V.O.)
And his dream must have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it.
Gatsby turns back towards Nick, and smiles... 
132.
NICK (V.O.)
He did not know that it was already behind him... 
Nick smiles back.
NICK (V.O.)
Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year, recedes before us... 
PUSH PAST GATSBY: Out over the water, toward the green light eternally pulsing at the end of Daisy’s dock... 
NICK (V.O.)
It eluded us then, but that’s no
matter - tomorrow we will run
faster... 
Gatsby reaches out--
NICK (V.O.)
Stretch out our arms farther...  And one fine morning... 
As we PUSH PAST Gatbsy’s outstretched hand, THE OPENING IMAGE RETURNS: The green light pulsing in the abstract dark... 
Nick’s final words appear as TYPE ON THE SCREEN.
NICK (V.O.)
So we beat on, boats against the
current, borne back ceaselessly,
into the past.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. SANTITARIUM - NICK’S ROOM - SUMMER - DAY
Nick pulls a final page from his typewriter, sets the page on top of his completed manuscript and we clearly see the title:
“GATSBY.”
Nick considers this and then handwrites:
“THE GREAT... ”
DISSOLVE THROUGH THE FINAL TITLE - “THE GREAT GATSBY” - TO:
The green light. It pulses one last time...  Then, fades to
BLACK.
THE END.
