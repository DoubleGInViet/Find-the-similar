INT. MASTER SUITE - MORNING
Fresh steam from a shower fills the air. Dvorak’s “Tempo di Valse” plays on the sound system with digital clarity.
MICHAEL BRYCE is getting ready for his day. Mid-thirties, handsome, very much in shape. This is a man at the height of his powers.
He uses a shaving brush and real cream, not foam. He hums along with Dvorak as he whisks the blade over his skin.
He quickly makes the bed -- the sheets are barely mussed.
He’s a good-looking guy to be sleeping alone.
Now onto the clothes. If you know suits, you can tell Bryce’s is handmade. So are his shoes. He completes the outfit -- cufflinks, wristwatch, double-windsor on the necktie.
Bryce’s cell phone BUZZES. Text message. It’s urgent. His movements become sharper, faster. He straps on two matching GLOCK 18 MACHINEPISTOLS -- one holstered above each hip.
Bryce slips on an overcoat of fine vicuna wool. He takes a final look in the mirror -- the concealed guns don’t break the line of the coat. Perfect.
INT. HOLDING CELL - MORNING
Darkness.
The LIGHTS snap on. The fluorescent hum is loud in the confined space. Time to wake up.
SEAN KIERNAN, mid-thirties, is already awake. And already dressed. He sits on his bare cot, staring straight ahead. He hardly even winces at the sudden bright light.
Under the jailhouse scruff, Kiernan’s a handsome guy. But his clothes are drab, carefully chosen not to stand out. And his expression is dark -- a black cloud hangs over him.
The cell door buzzes open. Four armed GUARDS enter. Kiernan rises from his cot. With just a hint of an Irish brogue:
KIERNAN
Morning, lads.
Kiernan politely complies as the Guards put him in leg irons, a waist chain, and handcuffs.
They lead him into the hall. Even in the restraints, Kiernan moves with a fluid grace.
2.
INT. BRYCE’S JAGUAR (MOVING) - DAY
TITLE:
Geneva, Switzerland
Bryce is behind the wheel of his Jaguar XFR, gliding through the business district. Fast but controlled.
He’s downloaded a set of architectural BUILDING PLANS to his phone. He scans through them as he drives, while also doing a call through his Bluetooth:
BRYCE
Tell him I’ll be there shortly. And that he should relax. There’s nothing to worry about.
MALE VOICE (ON PHONE)
Um... ?
BRYCE
I know. Tell him anyway.
Bryce hangs up. Turns on the stereo. Classical MUSIC plays.
INT. A CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
Recessed lighting. A long, polished table. Frosted windows of bulletproof glass.
TITLE:
INTERPOL Global Headquarters -- Lyon, France
Kiernan, still shackled, sits at the table with his lawyer,
HARR. They’re facing a line of three ATTORNEYS. Several other
PEOPLE sit in shadow against the wall.
Everyone tries not to stare at Kiernan, but they can’t help it -- they’re fascinated by his presence. The lead attorney on the other side, MORENO, begins.
MORENO
Mr. Kiernan. Following negotiations between the International Criminal Court and all of the relevant nation-states, we now have a formal and binding offer.
Paperwork is slid across the table.
3.
MORENO
If you testify against President
Demidov -- and if your testimony
results in a conviction -- your
wife will receive a full pardon
from all jurisdictions.
KIERNAN
Ex.
MORENO
Pardon?
KIERNAN
Janet’s my ex-wife.
MORENO
Of course. Apologies.
KIERNAN
Also, she’s completely innocent and you people have no business charging her with anything. You want to apologize for that?
Harr motions Kiernan to settle down. He skims the document.
HARR
That will suffice for Janet, very
good. And now -- what will my
client receive?
Another document is slid across the table. A single sheet.
MORENO
This letter, signed by myself and the leadership of the ICC, praising Mr. Kiernan’s cooperation and strongly recommending leniency.
Harr is appalled. This one, he doesn’t even bother reading.
HARR
My client is about to give you the most reviled war criminal on the planet. And in return, you want to give him a thank-you note?
MORENO
It will be a mitigating factor--
4.
HARR
There is no mitigating. My client
is a contract killer, facing two
dozen counts of murder in ten
countries. Absent a deal, he will
never breathe free air again. We
all know that. Now--
A SOUND stops them. Pen scratching paper. Kiernan is signing the document.
Harr starts to protest -- but a look from Kiernan tells him it’s pointless. Kiernan slides the papers back.
One of the people along the wall stands. He’s INTERPOL DEPUTY DIRECTOR RAFAEL CASORIA. Fifties, with an old-world elegance.
CASORIA
Let’s get this man to the Hague.
INT. UNDERGROUND GARAGE - DAY
Kiernan, now in a protective vest along with his restraints, is brought in by the Guards.
CASORIA
This is Agent Ryder.
INTERPOL AGENT AMELIA RYDER, thirty, attractive, falls into step with them. This is a big assignment for her.
AMELIA
Sean, I’ll be accompanying you, along with your security detail --
--	a dozen OFFICERS, clad in all black, wearing full body
armor and carrying ASSAULT RIFLES. They’re standing in front of three ARMORED SUVS.
To us, it’s an imposing sight, but Kiernan stops. Skeptical.
KIERNAN
Hang on now. Demidov has taken out every single witness against him, and this is my detail?
CASORIA
These men are GIPN. That’s France’s most elite police--
KIERNAN
--police, exactly. You need
military boys on this.
5.
Casoria’s second-in-command is ASSISTANT DIRECTOR GERARD FOWLER. Forties, British.
FOWLER
No one knows you’re testifying. Or that you’re even here.
Kiernan just laughs at that. The GIPN COMMANDER approaches --
GIPN COMMANDER
(French accent)
Monsieur Kiernan, I must insist on your cooperation. And I assure you, we are fully prepared--
KIERNAN
Oh are you, now?
(French, subtitled)
(Do you have air support? Advance
teams sweeping primary and
secondary routes? Spotters placed
at elevation points?)
The Commander is thrown. No.
KIERNAN
No offense to you fine people. But I’m the expert at this sort of business. Interpol, you’re a bunch of bureaucrats, and you --
(to the GIPN Commander)
--	you’re just a cop. Also, let’s face it: you’re French.
FOWLER
The court’s deadline is three days away. There is no time to arrange a multinational military escort.
KIERNAN
Even better, then: uncuff me, give me the car keys and a gun, and send these French lads home. I can handle myself.
GIPN COMMANDER
We can handle him. It is a short ride through town to the airfield. I have the utmost confidence.
AMELIA
(to Casoria)
But sir, maybe we should consider--
6.
Casoria silences her with a look. This is his call.
CASORIA
Take him.
The GIPN team starts to lead Kiernan towards the center SUV.
Fowler catches up to Amelia.
FOWLER
If you feel unsafe, we won’t force you to go.
AMELIA
Thank you, sir. I’m going.
KIERNAN
Suit yourself. But if I was being hired to kill me, against this...  I wouldn’t even charge full price.
Amelia hesitates -- but she gets in the SUV with Kiernan.
INT. BRYCE’S JAGUAR (MOVING) - DAY
Bryce pulls into a garage beneath a towering office building.
INT. PARKING GARAGE - DAY
Bryce cruises down the rows of spaces. He passes two MAINTENANCE GUYS at work. Finds a spot near the elevators.
Bryce walks to the elevators, looking straight ahead -- but using reflective surfaces of other cars to scan the garage. Casually watching his back without turning around.
He waits patiently at the bank of elevators. Gets on.
INT. ELEVATOR - DAY
Once the doors close, Bryce opens the elevator’s control panel. He takes a thick ring of keys from his briefcase. Finds one that fits.
He places a small ELECTRONIC DEVICE inside the control panel, clipping it to the wires. He hits the button for fourteen.
INT. FOURTEENTH FLOOR - DAY
An opulent reception area. A RECEPTIONIST at a massive desk.
7.
BRYCE
Terrence Donner. Mr. Seifert is
expecting me.
RECEPTIONIST
Yes, welcome. I’ll buzz him.
BRYCE
No need. Down the hall, fifth
office on the right, yes?
Bryce never stops moving. A busy executive. He reaches
SEIFERT’S OFFICE
where SEIFERT, forties, sits on the edge of his desk. His coat already on. A man on the verge of panic.
Bryce, on the other hand, looks perfectly relaxed.
BRYCE
Hi, how are you? Love this office.
Lighting is everything, isn’t it?
SEIFERT
(low)
My wife’s not answering her phone.
BRYCE
Your wife is safe. My associates
brought her to a hotel.
Bryce checks the windows, continuing his recon under the pretense of admiring the space.
BRYCE
Mr. Seifert, I’m very pleased that I can be of assistance. As with all new clients, I’d like to briefly explain our working relationship: if you want to live, you will do exactly what I tell you to do.
(beat)
I hope that’s acceptable.
Seifert quickly nods. It’s acceptable.
BRYCE
Excellent. Let’s be on our way.
Bryce leads Seifert back into the
HALLWAY
8.
BRYCE
I’ll walk just behind you, but I go through doors first. Relax. Smile.
They move at a brisk pace. Brisk, not rushed. Bryce keeps a pleasant smile on his face as he tells Seifert:
BRYCE
It’s important that this not look like an extraction. Whoever’s been sent is likely already here. If they think you’re running, they’ll move on you immediately.
As in the garage, Bryce stays aware of his surroundings without seeming to. As they approach the elevators --
--	Bryce draws a key fob from his pocket. A REMOTE. He hits the button --
--	the ELEVATOR he came up in opens. They get on.
INT. ELEVATOR - DAY
Bryce presses buttons for the lobby and the garage. As soon as the doors close, Seifert goes into full panic --
SEIFERT
Oh my God...  I never should have
gotten into business with those
people. I didn’t know--!
BRYCE
Mr. Seifert. You’re frightened and I sympathize. But my job becomes infinitely more difficult if I have to sedate you.
Seifert settles down.
As the elevator descends, Bryce takes a small black CYLINDER out of his briefcase and affixes it to the ceiling.
BRYCE
Move away from the doors, please.
Seifert does. They wait. The doors open at the lobby.
9.
INT. LOBBY - DAY
Bryce gets off first. All clear. He motions Seifert to follow. The doors close behind them. Bryce takes out his cell phone. It’s receiving a CAMERA FEED. A view of --
THE ELEVATOR
The cylinder Bryce placed on the ceiling is a CAMERA. The elevator doors open --
--	and now the camera has a view of the garage. Rows of cars, nothing unusual. The Maintenance Guys are gone.
Bryce studies the feed, then leads Seifert towards the stairs. Bryce knows right where they are -- he’s got the building layout memorized.
INT. PARKING GARAGE - DAY
Bryce and Seifert exit the stairwell.
BRYCE
Where are you parked?
Seifert points out his car. Bryce aims his phone at it -- camera mode, then he switches to an INFRARED VIEW.
There’s a HEAT SIGNATURE on the underside of Seifert’s car.
BRYCE
Let’s take my car.
SEIFERT
Why?
BRYCE
Because they put a bomb on yours.
Keep walking. Everything’s fine.
They go to the Jaguar. Bryce puts Seifert in the backseat. As he’s about to start the engine --
BRYCE
Put your head down.
SEIFERT
Why?
BRYCE
They put a bomb on my car, too.
Before Seifert can protest, Bryce calmly turns the ignition --
10.
-- PHWOOOOM -- the CAR BOMB detonates --
-- the Jag is hurled straight into the air -- -- then slams back down to the ground.
The Jag is scratched up, smoking, but otherwise -- intact.
Seifert, who didn’t put his head down like he was told, is dazed from bumping against the roof. And shocked to be alive.
BRYCE
Custom vehicle.
Bryce throws the Jag into gear, guns it towards the exit --
EXT. SEIFERT’S BUILDING - DAY
The two “Maintenance Guys” appear on either side of the ramp, both with SUBMACHINE GUNS -- FIRING at the Jag.
This time, Bryce doesn’t have to tell Seifert to get down.
The fusillade of BULLETS chips away at the Jag’s armored paneling and ballistic glass. Bryce tears past the attackers, they’re almost to the street --
--	a GARBAGE TRUCK slams to a stop, cutting off their escape. Bryce brakes, cuts the wheel hard, comes to a stop broadside of the truck.
Terrified PEDESTRIANS up and down the sidewalk. No clear escape path. The attackers are still FIRING, the ballistic glass is starting to give... 
There’s just enough space between the Jag and the truck for Bryce to open his door, drawing one of his MACHINEPISTOLS --
--	a half-second faster than the truck’s PASSENGER, leaning out the window with a SUBMACHINE GUN. Bryce FIRES -- the Passenger ducks back in.
Bryce pulls a small BLACK OBJECT from his coat, throws it in the truck’s cab --
--	it’s a STUN GRENADE. It explodes with a burst of blinding LIGHT and a concussive BOOM.
Bryce draws his other MACHINEPISTOL -- turns and FIRES over the hood of the Jag at the Maintenance Guys. He has excellent cover, they’re on exposed ground -- he kills them both.
11.
Back to the truck. The Passenger and DRIVER are still disoriented, trying to recover --
--	too late. Bryce SHOOTS them, too. Silence. Bryce scans the environment. No further threats.
He gets back in the Jag. GUNS it. Checks the mirrors. No pursuit, no second wave. Bryce whips --
AROUND THE CORNER
then pulls over. Seifert is huddled low in his seat. Bryce runs his hands over Seifert’s body, checking for injuries. None.
BRYCE
Congratulations, Mr. Seifert. You
have been a model client. And
you’re alive and unhurt.
Bryce gets back on the road. Seifert slowly emerges from his crouch. He starts breathing again. Suddenly, Seifert starts to LAUGH. A crazed, weepy joy.
SEIFERT
Oh...  oh my God... 
Bryce grins. He’s seen this before. He pops the glovebox.
Bottles of water, a container of pills.
BRYCE
Take one pill, please. One.
As Seifert swallows, Bryce places a call.
EMERGENCY OPERATOR (ON PHONE)
Polizei.
BRYCE
My name is Michael Bryce. I am an executive protection agent, licensed within the EU. I have just engaged assailants on the Route de Mayrin and am now extracting my client from the scene. When I am able, I will gladly return and make myself available for questioning. Thank you.
Bryce hangs up. Glances at Seifert. He’s starting to come down from the adrenaline rush. Bryce pulls out a cell phone.
12.
BRYCE
Your wife will want to hear your
voice. Hit send.
The call connects --
SEIFERT
(into phone)
Honey? I’m okay. Yes. Yes. I love you, darling. I love you so much... 
As Seifert gushes into the phone, Bryce listens with a smile.
But it’s a sad smile. Must be nice, what Seifert has.
EXT. LYON - HIGHWAY - DAY
Kiernan’s convoy races along the gleaming banks of the Rhone. Three armored SUVs, lights and sirens. Kiernan is in the center vehicle.
INT. KIERNAN’S SUV (MOVING) - DAY
The GIPN Commander and THREE OFFICERS. Kiernan rides in back with Amelia, the Interpol agent.
Amelia watches Kiernan. His eyes are closed. His head leaning forward. He’s...  dozing.
AMELIA
Thought you were so concerned.
Kiernan doesn’t even open his eyes.
KIERNAN
We’re on a highway.
Back to his nap.
EXT. LYON - PRESQU’ILE - DAY
The convoy pulls off the highway and into the heart of Lyon, moving across the Place Bellecour. Ancient buildings and grand fountains line their route.
INT. KIERNAN’S SUV (MOVING) - DAY
As the vehicle slows...  Kiernan comes awake. He leans forward, surveying the road. His focus is absolute.
He calls out to the GIPN Commander, riding shotgun:
13.
KIERNAN
Know where I would do it? On this stretch of road coming right up. The curves will cut our speed, and those buildings are close in -- great firing positions.
The GIPN team is uneasy. Kiernan’s the expert.
KIERNAN
If I could sit closer to the front,
I could help.
But the Commander ignores him. The convoy continues on.
The Fourviere hill looms ahead -- below it, Lyon’s medieval quarter. Pitched, narrow streets. Picturesque...  but deadly.
KIERNAN
Oh yeah. Perfect. Choke points all along our route and we have zero visibility.
Still nothing from the Commander. Kiernan turns to Amelia.
KIERNAN
Almost there... 
Amelia nods to the Commander: let him up.
The Commander, quietly furious, mutters in French to one of his Officers, who unbuckles Kiernan’s seat belt.
Kiernan gets on the floor. He slides forward as best as he can in his restraints. To the DRIVER:
KIERNAN
(French, subtitled)
(You won’t have time to decide if
you believe me. So decide now.)
INT./EXT. KIERNAN’S SUV/LYON - DAY
The vehicles wind through the quiet streets. PEDESTRIANS stop to watch. The old buildings are two and three stories, clustered on either side. Kiernan is on the lookout.
Then, movement outside -- PROJECTILES flying at the SUV -- -- the GIPN Officers turn, rifles up --
--	ROCKS bounce harmlessly off the car. Outside, a group of KIDS ducks back into an alley, laughing.
14.
The GIPN team is rattled. Kiernan barely even turned his head. He’s focused on the real danger:
They’re coming to a curve in the road.
As the convoy slows, Kiernan leans forward, scanning --
--	CARS parked along the road. Kiernan’s eyes lock on a small PEUGEOT. Innocuous, except the rear end is low to the ground, like there’s extra weight on the suspension --
KIERNAN
(Brake! Pull right, right--)
The Driver believes Kiernan. He brakes and pulls right as --
--	THE PEUGEOT DETONATES -- a huge FIREBALL -- just as they would have passed it --
--	no direct hit, but the blast knocks the SUV on its side -- it SLAMS into a line of parked cars.
The other SUVs screech to a halt -- more EXPLOSIONS all around -- ROCKET-PROPELLED GRENADES --
--	coming from upper windows on both sides of the street. But the SUVs are heavily armored -- holding for now.
The GIPN Officers pour out of the SUVs, FIRING up at the windows, taking out ATTACKERS.
The street is filled with smoke and fire.
KIERNAN’S SUV
The GIPN men throw open the side door -- now facing skyward -- and SHOOT out of the opening like tank gunners.
Amelia, still unsteady, calls to Kiernan --
AMELIA
I’ll unlock you--
She puts her hand to her belt -- no keys. Kiernan already has them. He’s unlocking his cuffs.
An Officer sees Kiernan about to free himself -- he draws a TASER, leaps at Kiernan -- the ELECTRIC WHINE building --
--	Kiernan doesn’t pull away, like anyone else would -- he lunges right into the Officer, HEADBUTTING him -- and taking the full force of the TASER right in the chest.
Fifty thousand watts.
15.
Both men go down -- but the Officer stays down. Kiernan recovers. He calmly finishes unlocking his cuffs. Amelia watches, stunned.
EXT. LYON STREET - DAY
Bodies everywhere. Heavy casualties on both sides.
The surviving GIPN men have formed a cordon around Kiernan’s SUV. The RPG bombardment has given way to a ground assault -- ATTACKERS advancing from all directions. A tightening noose.
INT. KIERNAN’S SUV - DAY
BULLETS pound against the frame of the SUV.
Amelia digs out the damaged radio as two GIPN men go out the top of the vehicle. The Commander stands FIRING in the open doorway -- then falls back into the SUV. BLOOD pours. Dead.
Kiernan takes the RIFLE and SIDEARM off the Commander’s body. He moves to the rear door --
AMELIA
Don’t!
Too late -- Kiernan throws the rear door open -- using it as a shield as he emerges into the open air --
EXT. LYON STREET - DAY
Kiernan takes in the scene. The ATTACKERS all around the SUV.
Drawing in.
Using the heavy SMOKE as cover, Kiernan runs directly away from the SUV -- holding his fire, staying low, concealed --
--	he runs right through the circle of Attackers -- now he’s behind them, he turns --
--	he’s not escaping. He’s making a counter-strike.
Kiernan circles around the Attackers, FIRING at a dead run, with incredible accuracy. He’s mowing them down.
Kiernan stops to reload --
--	the Attackers have taken out the last of the GIPN cordon. They’re advancing on the SUV.
16.
INT. KIERNAN’S SUV - DAY
Just Amelia and the final Officer in here. She’s trying the radio --
AMELIA
We’re under attack--!
No reply, no static, nothing. Radio’s dead. The Officer draws his weapon and races into the
STREET
and right into a barrage of GUNFIRE. He doesn’t have Kiernan’s speed -- he’s immediately cut down.
The final two Attackers move in on the SUV --
-- Kiernan emerges from the smoke, SHOOTS them both -- -- just as a THIRD ATTACKER rises from behind a car --
-- Kiernan spots him -- almost in time. They both FIRE -- Kiernan makes a perfect killshot, but also gets HIT.
The shooting stops. Silence. Charming, historic Lyon is now a graveyard.
Kiernan checks his body. Grazed in a few places -- and a direct hit, just below his knee. BLOOD flows from it. Kiernan stands -- he can put weight on the leg, at least.
Amelia calls from inside the wrecked SUV:
AMELIA
Sean?
KIERNAN
I’m fine. Check the others.
Kiernan’s not fine. His leg is bleeding heavily. But he’s got work to do:
He rifles through the corpses of the Attackers. He digs through pockets, rips off masks, checks tattoos. He does this roughly, quickly. No respect for the dead.
Amelia finds the SUV’s med kit and starts checking the GIPN team for survivors. None to be found. She’s shaken -- this kind of carnage is beyond her experience.
Kiernan rips the sleeve of one of the Attackers -- there’s an intricate TATTOO of a CHURCH on his forearm.
17.
Kiernan pulls a CELL PHONE from the Attacker’s pocket. He hits SEND. The call connects. Kiernan acts scared, desperate:
KIERNAN
(Russian, subtitled)
(We took fire. I’ve been hit...  I can’t find anyone. I need the key.)
MALE VOICE (ON PHONE)
(Russian, subtitled)
(Did you kill Kiernan?)
KIERNAN
(I’m...  not sure. I’ve been shot. I need the key. Please.)
MALE VOICE (ON PHONE)
(beat)
(Eight seven two. Good luck.)
The call disconnects. Kiernan uses the phone’s camera to take a few pictures of the church tattoo, then --
AMELIA
Drop the weapon.
He turns. Amelia’s holding the med kit -- and her SIDEARM, aimed right at him. He shrugs, kicks his gun to her.
The blood from Kiernan’s leg is pooling on the ground around him. She tosses him a set of handcuffs.
AMELIA
Put these on. I’ll dress your leg.
Kiernan hurls the cuffs away. Forget it. A brief stare-down.
He wins.
KIERNAN
We’re exposed out here.
Kiernan limps away. Amelia follows him into an
ALLEY
He digs through the med kit. He pockets a needle and surgical thread, then starts field work on his leg. Alcohol, pressure bandage, the basics.
Keeping her gun on Kiernan, Amelia takes out her phone --
KIERNAN
No calls.
18.
AMELIA
I have to tell Interpol--
KIERNAN
You can’t trust Interpol. After
this?
AMELIA
I’ll take precautions. But we’re the only agency with transnational jurisdiction. It’s still my only way of getting you to the Hague.
KIERNAN
I can get there on my own.
Amelia ignores that, dials --
INT. INTERPOL - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
Casoria, Fowler, and other AGENTS are gathered. Casoria lunges for the phone. Puts her on speaker.
CASORIA
We lost radio contact. What’s
happening--?
INTERCUT
AMELIA
We got hit. Everyone’s down.
CASORIA
Dear God. And Kiernan?
KIERNAN
Don’t tell them--
AMELIA
Kiernan’s alive.
CASORIA
Where is he now?
She’s got the gun -- Kiernan will have to convince her.
KIERNAN
I’m not going to run, alright?
Testifying is how I get Janet free.
You and I want the same thing.
FOWLER
Agent Ryder. Where is Kiernan?
19.
Chain of command. It’s decision time for Amelia. And --
AMELIA
I don’t know where he is. He
escaped.
Stunned silence in the conference room. Amelia hangs up.
END INTERCUT
KIERNAN
Nicely done. You’re a smooth one,
you are. Now close your eyes and
count to twenty.
Distant SIRENS. Kiernan starts limping away --
AMELIA
You really think you’ll make it? On that leg? As a fugitive?
KIERNAN
I’ll see you at the Hague.
She watches Kiernan go. Thinking it over. Calls after him:
AMELIA
My apartment’s not far. No one will look for you there. You need to rest. Clean up. And you need blood. I can get you blood.
She writes down the address for him. Kiernan checks his bandage -- already soaked through. He’s considering it.
KIERNAN
How do I know you won’t change your mind and send Interpol to fetch me?
As a sign of good faith, she gives Kiernan something else:
the gun she took from him.
Okay. He disappears down the alley.
EXT. OUTSIDE GENEVA - AIRFIELD - DAY
Bryce escorts Seifert to a waiting single-engine CESSNA.
The ENGINE is roaring -- too loud to talk. Seifert hugs Bryce tightly. Bryce takes the hug good-naturedly; he’s used to that reaction. Seifert disappears into the Cessna.
20.
Bryce goes to his Jag, parked by a hangar. He throws a cover over it, concealing its bullet-riddled frame. Parked right next to it --
-- a second, identical Jaguar. Clean and ready to go.
As the Cessna climbs into the air, Bryce’s cell RINGS. He checks the Caller ID -- this is important.
Bryce quickly ducks into the Jag for a quiet place to talk.
His voice drops a register:
BRYCE
You couldn’t stay away.
EXT. LYON STREET - DAY
Amelia stands among the wreckage of the attack. The SIRENS are getting closer. She’s on her cell.
INTERCUT
AMELIA
Hmm. Am I the one who’s been
staying away?
BRYCE
Fair point. I’m glad you called.
AMELIA
Can you be in Lyon tonight?
BRYCE
I absolutely can and I will.
AMELIA
Bring a few units of O-negative.
BRYCE
(beat)
Personally, I’m more fond of champagne, but now I sense this is not a social visit.
AMELIA
I can’t say more on the phone. This has to stay under the radar. Thank you, Michael.
Amelia hangs up -- just as the POLICE CARS surround her. She steps into the open, hands raised, badge showing.
Bryce stares at his phone for a moment. Starts the engine.
21.
EXT. LYON BACKSTREETS - DAY
Kiernan slips through the streets, making his getaway, talking on the cell he took off the Attacker.
KIERNAN
(heavy Irish accent)
Aye, it’s urgent. Did you not hear me say I’m her lawyer?
A few moments later --
INT. DOCHAS CENTRE PRISON - PHONE ROOM - DAY
Nothing but a table, chair, and phone. A Guard leads JANET KIERNAN inside. She’s thirty, a soft beauty. Doesn’t belong in this place. The Guard leaves. Janet picks up.
JANET
(Irish accent)
This is Janet.
INTERCUT
KIERNAN
It’s Sean.
Her breath catches. Conflicting emotions.
KIERNAN
They’re treating you well enough?
You’re getting by, are you?
JANET
Aye. Well enough.
KIERNAN
I am going to get you out. I promise you that. I know I’m not someone you ought to believe, but I will fix this. I ruined your life once, Janet. But just the once.
JANET
Sean...  how are you calling me?
What’s happened?
KIERNAN
Don’t ask. I don’t want to lie to
you again. Be well.
JANET
Sean--?
22.
He hangs up. After the line has gone dead --
KIERNAN
Love you, dear.
Kiernan turns the phone off. Removes the SIM card.
EXT. AMELIA’S BUILDING - DAY
Kiernan, looking ashen, goes in through a side entrance.
INT. AMELIA’S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - DAY
Bloody towels all over the floor. Kiernan is suturing the wound on his leg. His stitching job is adequate but a little jagged -- first aid isn’t his strong suit.
He’s using vodka as a disinfectant. He wants a drink, but the bottle’s almost empty. Hmm. He pours a little more on his leg, then gulps the rest. It goes down like water.
LATER
Kiernan tests his leg -- putting weight on it, springing off.
Like a mechanic running diagnostics.
INT. AMELIA’S APARTMENT - GUEST ROOM - DAY
Kiernan is laid out on the bed. Trying to conserve energy.
He scrolls through the cell-phone PHOTOS he took of the Attacker’s tattoo. Zooms in. In the detailed inkwork, now we see something more -- tiny NUMBERS hidden in the church.
On a notepad, Kiernan has written “8 2 7.” He copies down numbers from the tattoo, then begins transposing the digits.
Some kind of code.
INT. AMELIA’S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - DAY
Kiernan burns the notepad in the kitchen sink, then runs the garbage disposal. Destroying it completely.
INT. DEMIDOV’S CELL - DAY
Except for the heavy metal door, this feels more like a hotel suite than a prison cell. The inmate is the man himself: ALEXANDER DEMIDOV, fifties.
23.
TITLE:
ICC Detention Centre -- The Hague
Demidov has lost none of the imperiousness of power. He wears a suit and tie, and looks ready to retake command at any moment. The news plays on a small TV:
NEWSCASTER (ON TV) The trial of Alexander Demidov continues. Demidov, the former president of Kajekistan, is accused of selling black-market arms on a massive scale to terrorist groups and fellow dictators across the globe. Fueling genocides in Africa and Asia, as well as terror attacks against western democracies... 
Demidov is unfazed by the accusations. A KNOCK on the door.
He mutes the news.
Two GUARDS bring in LIVITIN, forties, Demidov’s attorney. He looks embarrassed to be here. Russian accent:
LIVITIN
Interpol wishes to have a word--
Fowler shoves his way in. Furious. He gets right to it.
FOWLER
There was quite the dust-up in Lyon this morning. You wouldn’t know anything about that, would you?
LIVITIN
Agent Fowler, you have made a long and pointless journey. My client has nothing to say. Goodbye.
DEMIDOV
(Russian accent)
I have no secrets. A diversion would be welcome. You are my guest.
Livitin sighs. Motions the Guards to leave. As soon as the three of them are alone --
FOWLER
I gave you exactly what you needed.
How can Kiernan still be alive?
24.
LIVITIN
You have come all this way to lodge a complaint?
FOWLER
I have come for my money. I
delivered as promised.
Fowler hands Livitin a pen and an official document.
FOWLER
The code for the wire transfer to
my Cayman account, if you please.
LIVITIN
The job is not yet done. We need
you back at Interpol, monitoring
for any sign of Kiernan.
FOWLER
No. They already suspect a leak.
Casoria is no idiot. If I tip you
off again, I risk exposure.
DEMIDOV
You are already at risk. As am I.
(beat)
It is crucial that evidence of my
misdeeds not become public.
Suddenly -- Demidov lunges forward -- you wouldn’t expect him to be so fast --
--	he grabs Fowler’s hand -- and stabs him through the palm with his own pen. Demidov claps a hand over Fowler’s mouth to muffle the SCREAM.
DEMIDOV
So be sure to hide your wound from the guards.
Demidov pulls the pen back out, slowly, letting it get soaked in Fowler’s blood.
He releases Fowler, who stumbles back against the wall.
Livitin tosses him a towel.
DEMIDOV
When Kiernan is dead, you will be
paid in full.
Using the pen, Demidov scrawls on the transfer document. The letters “IOU” -- written in Fowler’s blood.
25.
Fowler is shaking, terrified. He’s never seen this side of Demidov up close. Now he just wants to help.
FOWLER
Kiernan...  it looks like he might
have been injured in the attack.
You should send another team to
Lyon in case he’s gone to ground.
Demidov nods: thank you. Livitin knocks on the door for the Guards to open it. Fowler leaves, wobbly, the towel wrapped around his hand to cover the wound.
Livitin unmutes the news, catching the end of the story:
NEWSCASTER (ON TV) ... despite the long catalog of Demidov’s alleged atrocities, the prosecution has been hard-pressed to make a solid case. The judges have set a deadline for the end of this week for prosecutors to present compelling evidence or allow Demidov to go free.
Livitin turns it off. They switch to Russian, subtitled:
LIVITIN
(Nothing about Kiernan, of course. They don’t want to give us clues. But we will find him.)
DEMIDOV
(I find this process unsavory. Silencing witnesses, hiding my work? I am the rightful president. I should hide from no one.)
LIVITIN
(As soon as you are back in power.)
DEMIDOV
(You are a good lawyer. But you do not understand power. A true leader does not slither.)
EXT. AMELIA’S BUILDING - NIGHT
Bryce parks on the street. Pops the trunk. Neatly arranged inside: a variety of WEAPONS and MEDICAL SUPPLIES.
Bryce takes out a small COOLER. Heads for the entrance.
26.
INT. AMELIA’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Amelia lets Bryce in. She has a few bruises and scratches from the day’s attack. He pulls her close, concerned.
BRYCE
What happened?
AMELIA
Work. Just banged up. I’m fine.
BRYCE
Are you sure? You need to put
ointment on this.
AMELIA
Michael, I’ve had full medical
attention. I promise you, I am in
perfect health.
BRYCE
Not for long.
Satisfied that she’s alright, Bryce sweeps her up and puts her on the table. She laughs, playfully fighting him off. As they make out --
AMELIA
No, Michael, focus. I brought you
here for work.
BRYCE
You’re going to start paying me?
That’s really not necessary.
She’s trying to break it off before they’re too far gone --
AMELIA
Seriously, we can’t. This is
important. Get up. Up.
One last deep kiss before they break.
AMELIA
You brought the blood, good --
She opens the cooler. Inside: a half-dozen RED ROSES.
AMELIA
I told you this was business.
BRYCE
They’re short-stem. They’re
business roses.
27.
AMELIA
And they’re lovely.
She digs deeper in the cooler -- several packets of BLOOD.
AMELIA
O-neg, even more lovely. Come on. I
want you to meet someone.
Amelia leads Bryce down the hall to the guest bedroom. She knocks lightly on the door, opens it --
-- but the bed is empty. Kiernan’s gone. Amelia turns --
-- Bryce is gone, too.
From the kitchen: CLICK. CLICK. Two GUNS being cocked almost simultaneously.
Amelia runs into the
KITCHEN
Bryce and Kiernan have their guns leveled at each other.
AMELIA
Guys. Easy.
BRYCE
What is he doing here?
KIERNAN
I’ve got the same question.
AMELIA
You two know each other?
BRYCE
We’ve never been formally
introduced.
KIERNAN
But I’ve shot him a few times.
BRYCE
Shot at, I think you mean.
KIERNAN
I winged you in Tangiers. I know I did.
BRYCE
Mmm, sorry. But at this range, you might have a chance.
28.
AMELIA
Guys. I’m sorry for the surprise. I will explain. Guns down.
Neither man complies. No one wants to back down first.
Amelia steps right between them. She stares hard at Bryce. He lowers his gun. Kiernan follows.
AMELIA
Now you’re being formally
introduced. Michael Bryce, meet
Sean Kiernan. Your new client.
They stare at each other. What the hell... ?
AMELIA
We are going to go in the other
room and speak politely. Make
yourselves comfortable.
Bryce and Kiernan are not at all comfortable.
INT. AMELIA’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
The roses have been put into a vase.
Bryce comes out of the kitchen with a cappuccino. Kiernan is propped up on the couch, getting a transfusion of the blood from Bryce’s cooler.
Amelia adjusts the pillows for Kiernan. Bryce’s eyes narrow.
BRYCE
Amelia, I can’t say I approve of
your new friends.
KIERNAN
Not that I care about your
approval, but I’ve never killed
anyone who didn’t have blood all
over their own hands. If a job’s
not right, I turn it down. You
should try that sometime.
BRYCE
Forgive me. Did I just receive
moral guidance from Sean Kiernan?
Amelia shoots Bryce a look: quiet. She’s ready to explain.
29.
AMELIA
We apprehended him three weeks ago, wrapping up a decade-long manhunt.
BRYCE
How did you finally catch him?
Amelia looks to Kiernan: alright to say? He shrugs.
AMELIA
He surfaced to visit his ex-wife.
We took her in as well.
KIERNAN
On completely made-up charges--
AMELIA
That wasn’t my call. But it did get Kiernan to give up the only person bigger than himself: an old employer, Alexander Demidov.
(she lets that land) Kiernan’s not my friend. But I do take an interest in his well-being.
Bryce understands the gravity now. He’s thinking it over.
KIERNAN
Hang on. It’s a sweet gesture and all, but I do not need a bodyguard.
BRYCE
That’s fine, because I’m not a “bodyguard.” I’m not a fat man in a cheap suit who keeps you from touching the dancers. I am an executive protection specialist.
KIERNAN
You are an utter gobshite. If I did need protection -- which I don’t -- I could do a lot better than him.
BRYCE
Is that right? You’ve tried to take out several of my clients over the years. I don’t think you’ve fared all that well.
KIERNAN
I killed Jeremy Gibson.
30.
BRYCE
Gibson didn’t follow protocol. You didn’t get Quattrano, you didn’t get Roth, you didn’t get Atienza... 
KIERNAN
I got Atienza.
BRYCE
You thought you got him. I switched vehicles on you. Tony Atienza is alive and well.
KIERNAN
On a yacht in Monte Carlo?
Bryce’s face falls.
KIERNAN
Not anymore.
AMELIA
I have to get back or it’ll look suspicious. You boys are welcome to keep one-upping each other on your way to the Hague.
BRYCE
I don’t believe I’ve said yes.
AMELIA
If Demidov is acquitted, he’ll be back in power inside a year. With a massive, newfound grudge against the global community.
BRYCE
So you want me to guard a man who’s nearly killed me numerous times?
AMELIA
I want the western hemisphere to
not be on fire.
(beat)
You are the last person I want to
involve in this. But you’re the
only one who can get it done.
KIERNAN
Thank you for the blood and the
hospitality. I can take care of
myself.
