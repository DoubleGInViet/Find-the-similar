Bryce hates this. But it’s got to be done. He faces Kiernan.
31.
BRYCE
Demidov is pursuing you. The
authorities are as well. Any safe
houses you had are blown. You’re
alone. And you’re injured.
(beat)
Don’t try to be a hero. You have no experience of it.
Kiernan glares. Amelia holds up her cell. A threat.
AMELIA
You let Michael protect you, or you take your chances with Interpol. And if you die, Janet gets life. Are we good?
Pause. Kiernan nods. Fine. Whatever.
EXT. AMELIA’S BUILDING - NIGHT
Two POLICEMEN are talking with an elderly NEIGHBOR. No subtitles necessary. The Neighbor is describing someone -- demonstrating Kiernan’s limp.
One of the Cops pulls up a PHOTO of Kiernan on his phone. The Neighbor nods. That’s him.
INT. INTERPOL - HALLWAY - NIGHT
AGENTS grabbing their coats and tearing outside. Casoria is on his cell. An ASSISTANT runs up to him.
ASSISTANT
Sir? We ran the occupants of that
building.
The Assistant shows Casoria a sheet of paper. He grimaces.
CASORIA
(into cell)
I have to go.
INT. AIRPORT LOUNGE - NIGHT
Fowler is on his cell.
CASORIA (ON PHONE)
I’ll keep you updated.
32.
FOWLER
Good luck.
Fowler hangs up. Rubs his injured hand. He’s struggling with this. Then -- he pulls out another phone and sends a text.
INT. A VAN (MOVING) - NIGHT
Six Kajeki MERCENARIES, heavily armed. Driving quickly through the Lyon streets. Demidov’s second team.
INT. AMELIA’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Kiernan is taking in the last unit of blood. His color is back now. Bryce and Amelia say goodbyes at the door.
AMELIA
Hate to have you working for free.
She pulls out a single bill -- a five-euro note. Bryce grins, pockets it.
BRYCE
Once we’re on the road, I’ll have to change out my phone. Can’t call to check in.
AMELIA
I’ve learned not to worry about
you. Sort of.
BRYCE
This is nothing. One night of
driving. When it’s done, let’s go
away. A long weekend in Amalfi.
Villa on the water.
AMELIA
Sounds wonderful. But after the
long weekend, after the good wine
and great sex, what then?
Bryce doesn’t have the answer she wants.
AMELIA
Not sure I can keep doing this.
He moves in to kiss her -- she wants to make it a kiss on the cheek, but gives in at the last second.
AMELIA
Be careful.
33.
And then she’s out the door. Kiernan observed all that, but he’s not going to comment.
Each of these guys has always been the alpha male in every room they’ve walked into. And now, they’re in the same room.
Bryce sits across from Kiernan. He switches into client mode, polite and professional:
BRYCE
Mr. Kiernan. The past is past. You are now my client, and I am very pleased to be of assistance. The working relationship is simple: if you want to live, you will do exactly what I tell you to do.
(beat)
I hope that’s acceptable.
Kiernan gives Bryce a look of pure fuck-you. They hold each other’s gaze. A measuring of wills.
The moment is broken when Bryce’s cell RINGS. He answers.
BRYCE
It’s going great so far. I’ve explained the working relationship, and he fully understands.
Kiernan rolls his eyes.
EXT. AMELIA’S BUILDING - NIGHT
Amelia on her cell, walking to her car. Down the street, POLICE CARS are setting up roadblocks.
AMELIA
Police. Setting a perimeter.
INT. AMELIA’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
BRYCE
We’re moving.
Bryce hangs up. Kiernan has already read his body language -- he tears the IV from his arm. Slaps a bandage on it.
BRYCE
Police. If they’re here, so is --
KIERNAN
-- Demidov.
34.
In just a few seconds, they’re ready to go. Both always prepared. As they move to the door --
BRYCE
This building has two--
KIERNAN
--two stairwells, no fire escapes, no adjoining roofs. Yeah.
Kiernan draws his gun, he’s about to open the door -- then Bryce yanks him back. Hard.
Kiernan’s fist comes up -- he so wants to hit Bryce.
BRYCE
Mr. Kiernan. I go through doors
first. You don’t follow until I
give the all clear.
KIERNAN
You are a mental case. I’ve opened doors before.
BRYCE
Let me explain: my job is to keep
you out of harm’s way.
KIERNAN
I am harm’s way.
Bryce points to where he wants Kiernan to stand. Seething, Kiernan goes to his spot.
Bryce draws a machinepistol, opens the door, staying low --
INT. AMELIA’S BUILDING - HALLWAY - NIGHT
Bryce quickly crosses to the doorway opposite. The hallway is clear. He motions Kiernan to come out. Kiernan moves into the hall, with an expression of mock-terror.
EXT. AMELIA’S BUILDING - NIGHT
Amelia drives up to a roadblock. Shows her ID to a POLICEMAN. He reads it. Double-checks. Then --
OFFICER
(French, subtitled)
(Turn off the engine. Step out.)
35.
As Amelia complies, the Officer waves someone over: Casoria.
He’s not happy with her.
INT. AMELIA’S BUILDING - HALLWAY - NIGHT
Bryce and Kiernan move towards the near stairwell. Kiernan with just a slight limp now.
As they reach the stairwell door, Bryce draws a COMPACT MIRROR from his coat. Uses it to look through the narrow window --
--	one of Demidov’s MERCS is on the landing, one floor down. Signaling to a SECOND MERC below him.
Bryce pulls back from the door. Whispers:
BRYCE
Two hostiles, possibly more. We’ll take the other stairwell.
Bryce starts that way, but Kiernan doesn’t follow.
KIERNAN
Let’s go through these guys.
BRYCE
We engage only as a last resort.
KIERNAN
What kind of gun are you carrying?
Bryce holds it up so he can see --
BRYCE
Glock 18 --
--	Kiernan snatches the machinepistol out of Bryce’s hand, throws open the stairwell door --
INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT
--	Kiernan comes in low, a gun in each hand -- FIRING, instantly killing both Mercs --
--	still in motion, no hesitation -- Kiernan leaps off the stairs, goes airborne over the railing --
--	FIRING again in midair -- killing TWO MORE MERCS on the landing below --
--	Kiernan’s vision and reflexes are unreal --
36.
--	he lands on the flight of stairs below. Slams into the wall, spreading the impact across his body and good leg.
Kiernan immediately rises back up in a perfect firing stance.
Flawless.
Bryce rushes into the stairwell, his other gun drawn --
-- but Kiernan’s already killed everyone.
KIERNAN
Thank God you’re here.
BRYCE
Bravo. But guess what happens now?
With a look of disgust, Bryce points outside --
BRYCE
(French, subtitled)
(Shots fired.)
EXT. AMELIA’S BUILDING - NIGHT
A POLICE OFFICER near the building gets on his radio, and exactly as Bryce predicted:
OFFICER
(Shots fired.)
The police aren’t creeping in anymore -- now they’re charging in. The SQUAD CARS fire up their lights, the perimeter is pulled in tighter, and... 
... HELICOPTERS appear on the horizon. Their SEARCHLIGHTS bathing the ground.
INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT
Kiernan and Bryce race down the stairs. They can already hear the HELICOPTERS.
BRYCE
See, now we have a new problem.
KIERNAN
Nothing I can’t handle.
BRYCE
What I like to do is think ahead.
Plan. Account for contingencies.
37.
KIERNAN
Brilliant. What I like to do is
have talent.
As they reach the second-floor landing --
--	the stairwell door on the first floor opens -- the last TWO MERCS -- Bryce, watchful, spots them an instant before Kiernan does --
--	Bryce shoves Kiernan aside to shield him -- and SHREDS both Mercs with his machinepistols.
BRYCE
I would be a lot more impressed by you if I wasn’t me.
Kiernan’s ear is ringing -- Bryce fired right by his head.
KIERNAN
Right in my ear, thanks.
BRYCE
(into his other ear) Apologies. But it’s not like you’re listening to me anyway.
Kiernan brushes him off, starts down the stairwell -- Bryce pulls him back. Points through the window --
--	the helicopters’ SEARCHLIGHTS are now covering the ground outside the exit door.
BRYCE
This way.
He motions Kiernan towards the hall. Kiernan wants to ignore Bryce, but knows he’s right. As they head down the
SECOND-FLOOR HALLWAY
Bryce keeps an eye on Kiernan’s limp.
KIERNAN
The leg’s fine.
BRYCE
I’ll determine that, Mr. Kiernan.
KIERNAN
Stop calling me that.
38.
Bryce watches Kiernan walk -- then nods, satisfied. He picks an apartment halfway down the hall -- KICKS the door open -- they run inside.
INT. SECOND-FLOOR APARTMENT - NIGHT
Bryce and Kiernan run straight through the apartment -- a young COUPLE cowers behind the couch, terrified -- Bryce CRASHES through a window, Kiernan follows him --
EXT. AMELIA’S BUILDING - NIGHT
--	no lights or police here; they didn’t expect Bryce and Kiernan to come out this way.
Both men hit the ground, landing and rolling. Kiernan protects his injured leg. They’re back on their feet --
--	and running through the dark, reaching a covering of trees just before the SEARCHLIGHTS sweep over them.
Safe -- at least for the moment.
Just as he did with Seifert, Bryce starts to run his hands over Kiernan’s torso, checking for injuries. But Kiernan freaks when Bryce touches him.
KIERNAN
Hey! Hands off, you feck.
BRYCE
I’m checking if you’re hurt.
KIERNAN
If I was hurt, don’t you think I
could tell?
Bryce shrugs, relents.
KIERNAN
You got a car?
BRYCE
Yes, but we can’t get to it now,
thanks to you.
KIERNAN
You know what? I didn’t ask you to be here. You are more than welcome to walk away.
39.
Bryce surveys the scene. All the roads are blocked. POLICE are closing in from everywhere. It looks bad.
BRYCE
Alright. Yes. I think I will.
Bryce holsters his machinepistols. Straightens his clothes, fixes his tie. He hands Kiernan the five-euro note that Amelia gave him. A refund.
BRYCE
I wish you the best in all your
future endeavors.
And with that, Bryce simply walks out from under the trees.
Hands in the air, heading right for the nearest roadblock.
Kiernan watches him go. Good riddance. He starts moving in the other direction, staying low --
--	one of the SEARCHLIGHTS picks up Bryce. A police car and TWO OFFICERS wait at the roadblock. They yell commands in French. Bryce obeys, dropping to his knees.
BRYCE
(I’m not a part of this.)
Now the Officers can see Bryce’s face under the searchlights.
One gets on the radio:
OFFICER
(It’s not him.)
The helicopter flies away, the SEARCHLIGHT moves off Bryce --
--	as soon as he’s in darkness, Bryce MOVES -- a couple of quick strikes -- in an instant, he takes down both Officers.
Bryce sees Kiernan heading the other way --
BRYCE
Excuse me, Mr. Kiernan?
Kiernan turns back. Sees that Bryce has given them a clear path through the perimeter.
BRYCE
I was thinking -- if you’re
interested -- you could come over
here and, you know, get away.
Kiernan swallows his pride. Runs back to Bryce.
40.
Bryce hurls a STUN GRENADE away from their position -- the BLAST and LIGHT draw the helicopters, giving them a few more seconds of darkness.
They drag the two unconscious Officers out of sight, then get into the police car. Bryce at the wheel.
INT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT
Bryce doesn’t start the engine right away. He holds out a hand. Kiernan knows what he wants. He grudgingly gives the five-euro note back to Bryce. Hired.
Bryce kills the siren lights and headlights. They drive away, a shadow in the dark, unseen by the helicopters.
The POLICE swarm Amelia’s building, not realizing they’ve already lost their quarry.
INT. INTERPOL - DEBRIEFING ROOM - NIGHT
A room meant to be claustrophobic. Amelia sits at the table across from Casoria. Fowler is here, too. Standing against the wall. Baleful.
Casoria pages slowly through a folder. Letting Amelia sweat -- but she’s not sweating.
CASORIA
I always expected that you would climb the ladder. But it seems you have taken command a bit earlier than I would have liked.
AMELIA
Official channels were clearly compromised. I had to use unofficial channels. Sir, if I can continue to overstep my bounds -- you need to take Kiernan’s face off the wire. Call off the manhunt. If we find him, so will Demidov.
Casoria mulls that over. He flips to a page on Janet.
CASORIA
You’re certain Kiernan will go to
the Hague and testify? Given his
skillset, won’t he simply try to
break his ex-wife out of prison?
41.
AMELIA
And turn her into a fugitive? Janet is innocent. She married Kiernan not knowing what he really was. He wants her pardoned.
CASORIA
Tell me more about these unofficial channels.
AMELIA
He’s an ex-CIA field operative who now provides personal security to high-value targets.
CASORIA
(beat)
Do he and Kiernan know each other?
AMELIA
They’ve interacted professionally.
Casoria digests that. Closes his folder.
CASORIA
You’re on indefinite leave pending a full investigation. You’ll surrender your credentials outside.
AMELIA
Sir.
CASORIA
(to Fowler)
You too. It’s simply procedure.
Fowler is visibly stricken. But he’s not about to argue.
Casoria motions for Fowler to leave. He does.
Casoria leans back in his chair. A little more casual now.
CASORIA
Very well. I have decided to do things your way. Since you’ve given me no other option.
AMELIA
With your permission, I’d still
like to attend the trial. As a
civilian, of course.
Casoria smiles: she’s got moxie. He nods.
42.
CASORIA
Amelia, you realize you are going to be telling this story for years. From inside a very large office or a very small cell.
AMELIA
Sir, not to make light, but I believe the only way Kiernan and Bryce don’t make it to the Hague is if they kill each other.
EXT. HOTEL PARKING LOT - NIGHT
Dark, set back from the road. Bryce stands watch while Kiernan hotwires a nondescript car.
BRYCE
I would have preferred to transport you in my custom-modified Jaguar XFR, complete with all my weapons and gear. But I’m sure we’ll do fine in this 2002 Shitheap.
KIERNAN
This car’s in good working order,
and it blends in. Deal.
BRYCE
Back roads for a few hours, then the expressway...  we’ll make the Hague by dawn. For one night, yes, I can deal.
KIERNAN
Ah, about that. We can’t go to the Hague just yet. First we have to make a quick stop in Amsterdam.
BRYCE
(beat)
I’m sorry?
Kiernan tosses Bryce the cell phone he took off the Attacker.
Talks casually as he continues hotwiring the car.
KIERNAN
Check out the pictures.
Bryce scrolls through the photos of the church tattoo; the embedded numbers are visible.
43.
KIERNAN
I know how Demidov’s teams operate. Those numbers are part of a double-blind encryption system, coded with a substitution cipher. You know what all those words mean?
BRYCE
Funny. The encryption is for... ?
KIERNAN
It lets them change locations of their safehouses without being tracked. The numbers are longitude and latitude down to the tenth. I got the key, broke the cipher -- it’s an address in Amsterdam.
BRYCE
Your sleuthing is delightful. But
why would we go there?
KIERNAN
Amsterdam’s a port city, a hub for Demidov’s arms sales. We go to this address, get some evidence against Demidov, and bring it to the Hague.
BRYCE
Evidence? We don’t need evidence.
We have your testimony.
(silence from Kiernan)
Your testimony. Against Demidov.
KIERNAN
See, okay. I did jobs for Demidov, but there were always layers between me and him. I don’t know enough to put him away. But it was my only shot at getting Janet out, so I had to at least try. But with actual evidence, I won’t need to fake it.
(beat)
Amsterdam. Good town. It’ll be fun.
The ENGINE catches. Kiernan’s hotwired it.
It takes a lot to make Bryce lose his temper. But this is a lot. He’s now on a slow burn.
BRYCE
Ah. Well. This is a fascinating
development.
(MORE)
44.
BRYCE (CONT'D)
Let me be sure I understand. In addition to the festivities we’ve already experienced, now you want me to come help you infiltrate the global arms-trafficking operations of Alexander Demidov and the Kajekistani Ministry of War. Yes?
KIERNAN
I’m not asking you to come. Sure as hell, I don’t want you to come. But if I ditched you, you’d hop on the phone to your girlfriend --
BRYCE
-- she’s not my girlfriend --
KIERNAN
--	and she’d set Interpol right back on my trail. So I’m stuck with you. Now get in the car.
Bryce stands there. Thinking it over.
BRYCE
Mr. Kiernan, I am at your service. But let’s you and I get very, very clear about one thing: you are not stuck with me. You need me. And you know you need me.
Now Kiernan’s pissed. He gets out of the car.
KIERNAN
Oh? Oh, really? Do you not know who
I am? Hi. Sean Kiernan.
BRYCE
Who cares? I’m Michael Bryce.
They’re right in each other’s face now --
KIERNAN
I’ve evaded the authorities for years. All of the authorities. There is not a security force on the planet I haven’t beaten. I’ve killed from miles away, from inches away. Anyone and anywhere.
BRYCE
I have protected monarchs. I have protected presidents. The U.S. Secret Service has hired me to teach them to be like me. You could populate a small town with the people whose lives I’ve saved.
BRYCE
I’ll tell you why you need me --
45.
KIERNAN
Yeah, please enlighten me --
-- Bryce punches Kiernan right in the face.
BRYCE
That’s why.
Kiernan is laid out on the ground, stunned. He truly did not see that coming.
BRYCE
Hey, are you hurt? Can you tell?
As Kiernan recovers, so does Bryce -- he realizes that he completely lost it for a moment.
BRYCE
I was making a point. Granted, that might have been inappropriate.
KIERNAN
Oh? Might it have been?
BRYCE
I sincerely apologize.
Kiernan gets to his feet. Bryce takes up a defensive stance, expecting an attack.
KIERNAN
No no. I’m not going to retaliate.
I’m going to be the bigger man.
We’ve got work to do.
BRYCE
You’re right. Yes. Let’s just get
on the road.
As they start for the car -- Kiernan throws a sudden flurry of punches at Bryce. And somehow, Bryce blocks them all. Kiernan is shocked -- his punches don’t get blocked often.
BRYCE
I have this job for a reason.
Kiernan grins. For the first time, Bryce has impressed him.
They head for the car -- both going for the driver’s side.
BRYCE
Sorry. The client never drives.
Kiernan’s annoyed. But he goes to the passenger side.
46.
BRYCE
Sit in back, please. It’s the
safest place in the vehicle.
Kiernan reluctantly opens the back door. Gets in.
INT. STOLEN CAR (MOVING) - CONTINUOUS
Bryce pulls out. Kiernan sits silently in back, feeling weird. After a moment:
KIERNAN
Now this is just stupid.
BRYCE
This is standard protocol.
KIERNAN
Do I at least get a coloring book?
BRYCE
In the event of an attack, you’ll get down low between the front and rear seats.
KIERNAN
In the event of an attack, I’ll
counter-attack and kill everyone.
BRYCE
No, that’s not--
Tired of the argument, Kiernan settles it by climbing into the front seat.
There’s an icy silence. Bryce turns on the RADIO. Static.
BRYCE
Can you find a classical station?
KIERNAN
And why would I do that?
BRYCE
Will you please just look for a classical station? Can you do even one thing that I ask you to do?
Fine. Kiernan turns the dial. Flips through a few stations.
Then he grabs ahold of the radio and RIPS the entire unit out of the dashboard.
47.
Kiernan starts tearing the radio apart with his bare hands.
Methodically, piece by piece. Bryce just watches him do it.
Finally, Kiernan tosses the demolished radio out the window.
KIERNAN
I looked. Didn’t find one.
They drive on in silence.
BRYCE
My telling you what to do...  it’s not meant as an insult. I’m simply trying to keep you alive.
KIERNAN
(beat)
I know. And this isn’t what you signed up for. But you need to get that I’m not your usual client.
BRYCE
Fair point. We both need to adapt
to the situation.
KIERNAN
For starters, stop with the “Mr. Kiernan” shite. Call me Sean, I’ll call you Mike.
BRYCE
Sean it is. Actually, I prefer
Michael. It sounds better.
KIERNAN
Does it?
BRYCE
I’m not religious, but Michael is the archangel of protection. I like the sound of that. It’s cool.
KIERNAN
Is it?
(Bryce looks wounded)
You’re right. Michael the
archangel. It’s very cool.
They drive on in silence.
INT. FOWLER’S HOUSE - NIGHT
Fowler is on his cell. He’s coming unglued.
48.
FOWLER
I have gone beyond the limit for
you. It’s over.
INT. DEMIDOV’S CELL - NIGHT
Livitin is on his cell. Demidov sits in a chair, reading a newspaper, as though this whole matter is beneath him.
INTERCUT
LIVITIN
I will double your fee. But nothing gets paid until we have results.
FOWLER
I’ve been frozen out. They’re about to investigate. I need to run. So I need money. Now.
Livitin throws Demidov a look. Demidov takes the phone.
DEMIDOV
(into cell)
Agent Fowler. If you are no longer an asset, you are a liability.
Fowler freezes. Hangs up. Starts throwing clothes in a bag.
Grabs his passport.
Demidov coolly regards the dead phone. Sets it down.
Done packing, Fowler goes to the door --
--	then gets thrown to the ground. TWO MEN. They pin Fowler, one puts a plastic bag over his head --
--	no wasted motion, these guys are pros --
--	a third man, IVANOV, carefully steps over them. He stays out of the way. Letting his men do their job.
Ivanov goes through Fowler’s things, finds his cell. Fowler stops struggling. Dead.
Ivanov dials. Livitin answers.
IVANOV
(Russian)
(It’s been resolved.)
49.
They hang up. Ivanov’s men -- OLEG and PETR -- put Fowler’s corpse in a bag. They leave with the body and the suitcase -- making it look like Fowler ran.
END INTERCUT
Demidov has returned to his newspaper.
DEMIDOV
(Look what I have been reduced to.
Executing functionaries.)
Livitin sits. He’s not eager to say this to Demidov:
LIVITIN
(We need to seriously discuss our
contingency plans.)
DEMIDOV
(Part of me wants to simply tell the truth. To say yes, I did it. Then I could leave that court with my dignity intact.)
Livitin smiles. Shakes his head.
LIVITIN
(As your lawyer, I would prefer you didn’t.)
INT. BRYCE & KIERNAN’S CAR (MOVING) - NIGHT
Road trip. This is when most people would make small talk. But the car is silent. The French countryside rolls away in the darkness.
Kiernan is antsy. He wants something to do.
KIERNAN
Do you need to talk? To stay awake,
I mean.
BRYCE
I’m fine, thank you. I can stay
awake under my own power.
KIERNAN
Alright. But it’s a long drive. And this car’s got no radio.
50.
BRYCE
How did you get into this work? I mean, how does someone decide, I’m going to kill people for a living?
KIERNAN
That is an excellent question. As a wee lad, many’s the hour I wiled away ripping the wings off butterflies and drowning kittens. Then one day it hit me: “By Jaysus, I could make money at this.”
BRYCE
I didn’t mean to imply that you’re a psychopath. Necessarily. But it is an unusual career choice.
KIERNAN
(beat)
I fell into it. My father was an arms dealer. I grew up at his side, traveling around the world, hanging out with warlords and guerrilla fighters. Being around all that so young, I picked up things. I started training, got good, got very good. Dad began hiring me out to his clients. It went from there.
BRYCE
Your own father got you into being a hitman? My God, what kind of--?
A dark look from Kiernan: drop it. Bryce does.
BRYCE
How I got into protection work is--
KIERNAN
--oh, I’m bored already. Because the CIA pays for shit and it’s a shit life and you don’t know if you’re on the right side or not. I’ve got a better question: how come Amelia’s not your girlfriend?
BRYCE
I’d rather not discuss my personal life.
KIERNAN
What? I told you about my father,
and that was all sad and weepy.
51.
BRYCE
There’s nothing weepy about me and
Amelia.
Bryce is done talking. Kiernan leans his seat back.
KIERNAN
Wake me when you want to switch.
BRYCE
We’re not switching.
KIERNAN
Don’t be daft. You can’t drive the whole night through.
Kiernan closes his eyes. Silence. Then:
BRYCE
What I have with Amelia is great. We have fun when we’re together, but there are no strings and we can see other people. Simple as that.
KIERNAN
Ah. Ah. But she doesn’t see other
people, now does she?
BRYCE
I have no idea.
(beat)
She should. I do.
KIERNAN
No you don’t.
Bryce is surprised. And busted.
KIERNAN
I can read people. Helps with the
job. So what’s your problem?
BRYCE
(beat)
I work in an extremely high-risk profession. Any day, I might not come home. How can I ask someone to make a lifelong commitment to me when I don’t know how much longer my life will last?
KIERNAN
What does she say about that?
52.
BRYCE
That she knows I will come home. That soldiers get married. Firemen get married. She doesn’t say “married,” but you know.
KIERNAN
She’s not wrong.
BRYCE
This job is the thing I’m good at. The one thing. I’m not sure I could keep doing it if I had someone waiting at home for me.
KIERNAN
If it makes you feel better...  I think you’re just okay at your job.
Bryce laughs. Kiernan closes his eyes. Drifts off.
LATER
Kiernan’s driving now; they’ve switched. Bryce is in the passenger seat, asleep -- with a machinepistol in each hand.
INT. ICC - TRIAL CHAMBER 1 - MORNING
Demidov’s trial is coming back into session.
Three JUDGES in a row on a high bench. Moreno and the other PROSECUTORS settling in. Demidov and Livitin at their own table. SPECTATORS filing into the small public gallery. Headphones for translation placed all around.
Amelia takes her seat in the gallery. She watches as Moreno confers with Casoria. Tension is high. No sign of Kiernan.
Casoria looks over at Amelia. A dark expression on his face.
EXT. AMSTERDAM - SPUISTRAAT - MORNING
The city’s up and awake. Pedestrians, bicycles, even the occasional car.
TITLE:
Amsterdam, Netherlands
Bryce and Kiernan sit at an outdoor cafe at the edge of Dam Square. Bryce with a cappuccino, Kiernan with a black coffee.
53.
Bryce has shaved, and he’s still immaculate in his overcoat and suit. Kiernan has not shaved. He’s changed into new clothes to blend in with the locals, but still looks scruffy.
Bryce has PAPERS laid out in front of him -- architectural blueprints, real estate records, government documents, etc. He’s doing advance work on --
SPUISTRAAT 294
A two-story home down the block. Unremarkable in this or any other neighborhood. Kiernan keeps an eye on the front door.
KIERNAN
How’s that cappuccino?
BRYCE
Mediocre. Outside of northern
Italy, no one gets the foam right.
KIERNAN
I hate that.
BRYCE
That’s just coffee in there, right?
KIERNAN
What’s that supposed to mean? Because I’m Irish, you think I’m a boozer?
BRYCE
I think you’re a “boozer” because
I’ve heard from many sources that
you are. Which I’m sure has no
connection to your being Irish.
KIERNAN
I never get pissed on a job. Okay?
BRYCE
(re: paperwork)
Nothing out of the ordinary. No
modifications on record.
KIERNAN
Still no movement out front.
BRYCE
Stay here while I do a pass.
Bryce gets up -- so does Kiernan. He’s coming with.
54.
EXT. BEHIND SPUISTRAAT 294 - DAY
Bryce and Kiernan stand in the alleyway, with a view of the back door. Bryce points his phone at the house.
BRYCE
No heat signatures. I’ll go in first and clear the structure. Once I know it’s safe, you can come in.
As Bryce starts for the back door --
KIERNAN
You have a lot of experience
breaking into places, do you?
Bryce considers that. He stands to the side, keeping watch.
Kiernan examines the back door.
KIERNAN
No cameras, no tripwires, no pressure plates. These boys really want this place to blend in.
Kiernan balls up his coat and smashes the back windowpane.
Reaches in and unlocks the door. Easy enough.
Bryce steps forward -- I go in first. Kiernan relents.
INT. SPUISTRAAT 294 - DAY
The house is sparsely furnished. Everything is orderly and untouched. This looks more like a model home than a place where someone actually lives.
Bryce does a sweep through the rooms. Kiernan tries to hang back, but it’s not in his nature -- he keeps moving ahead, getting in Bryce’s way. They’re still working out the kinks.
Fortunately, there’s no threat in the house. The only remarkable thing is a heavy deadbolt on the basement door.
As a loud BUS rolls past outside, Kiernan FIRES a single shot, blowing out the deadbolt.
They descend the stairwell into --
INT. BASEMENT - DAY
Virtually the entire basement is glistening WHITE. All the surfaces are surgically clean.
55.
The main area is dominated by a full OPERATING ROOM -- surgical table, biomonitor, implements -- they’re equipped to perform major surgery down here.
A row of empty beds, a generator, stores of food and water.
This is a miniature hospital, entirely self-contained.
KIERNAN
If I’d left any survivors in Lyon, they’d be here getting patched up.
Kiernan starts combing through the basement. Bryce joins him.
The men quickly tear the place apart. And... 
... they find nothing. There’s nothing here that isn’t for medical or survival purposes.
Kiernan is getting more and more frustrated.
KIERNAN
Dammit, dammit... 
Kiernan keeps searching -- going back over places he’s already checked. Bryce knows it’s hopeless.
BRYCE
This place has been scrubbed. We
should go.
Bryce moves for the stairs. Kiernan is fuming.
KIERNAN
And do what, then? This is our only lead.
BRYCE
I guarantee you we activated some
sort of alarm when we came in.
Think we’ll be alone much longer?
KIERNAN
You’re right. Good. Good thinking.
BRYCE
What?
Kiernan checks his gun.
KIERNAN
Whoever comes, we kill all but one.
We get what we need out of him.
56.
BRYCE
My job is to keep you alive, I’m
not going to let you--
KIERNAN
--let me? Alive’s not good enough. Without evidence, I can do nothing for her.
BRYCE
We have no idea what’s coming. This position is impossible to defend.
Bryce starts up the stairs, like he’s leaving --
BRYCE
Let’s hide upstairs.
On Kiernan. Good.
INT. SPUISTRAAT 294 - FIRST FLOOR - DAY
Kiernan and Bryce leave the back and basement doors ajar, then scatter SYRINGES on the ground. Now it looks like junkies broke in and left in a hurry.
They take up hiding places, Bryce with a view of the street.
They settle in to wait.
Nothing yet. Calm before the storm.
BRYCE
Understatement, but you’ve gone
above and beyond. For the court,
for your ex. Maybe they’ll cut your
sentence after all.
KIERNAN
Wouldn’t count on that. Got a bit
of a record, you know.
BRYCE
If I can ask...  what did you tell
your wife you did for a living?
KIERNAN
Said I was an intelligence operative. Top-secret and all. She believed me until the day Interpol knocked on our door.
BRYCE
Do you regret it?
57.
KIERNAN
Lying to her? Worst thing I’ve ever done. Really. Being married to her? Don’t regret a moment of that.
(beat)
Same as you -- in my line of work, I knew I could die any day. So I thought, I’ll grab hold of this beautiful thing while I can. Life is short, isn’t it? You and I know that better than most.
Bryce stays with that a moment. Then something out the window catches his eye --
EXT. SPUISTRAAT 294 - DAY
A beat-up van has pulled up out front. Four KAJEKI MEN get out. They’re dressed casually, but SUBMACHINE GUNS are visible under their coats.
BRYCE
Four. Coming in.
Kiernan takes up a firing position. Bryce considers.
BRYCE
We’re in a neighborhood. Gunshots
will bring the police.
KIERNAN
What? Now you want to run?
BRYCE
No. I want to take them without
firing shots.
Kiernan nods. Nice. Let’s do it.
As the Kajekis come around to the back door, Bryce and Kiernan move into separate rooms.
The Kajekis come in through the back, GUNS out. They spot the scattered syringes.
Two of the Kajekis start clearing the rooms, like Bryce and Kiernan did. The other two head down to the basement.
The first Kajeki checks one room --
KAJEKI
(Russian, subtitled)
(Clear.)
58.
The second Kajeki goes through another --
KAJEKI 2
(Clear.)
It’s routine, smooth. Bryce and Kiernan signal each other, they’ll each take one Kajeki --
-- now --
--	Kiernan claps a hand over the first Kajeki’s mouth, stabs him with a SCALPEL, heart and throat -- precision strikes -- he’s done for --
--	while Bryce presses the muzzle of his Glock against the second Kajeki’s head. Whispers:
BRYCE
(Clear.)
Kajeki 2 can tell Bryce is a pro. He calls out:
KAJEKI 2
(Clear. All clear.)
Kiernan gently lowers the corpse to the ground. Takes the second Kajeki’s gun. Bryce keeps his Glock on him.
BRYCE
(You’re lucky you got me.)
Bryce and Kiernan consider taking their captive and running for it. But they can hear FOOTSTEPS -- the other Kajekis are already on their way back up.
KAJEKI 3 (O.S.)
(Nothing down here.)
Bryce and Kiernan take positions near the stairwell... 
KAJEKI 3 (O.S.)
(Taras? Yuri? Are you there?)
Bryce nudges the second Kajeki -- TARAS.
TARAS
(Yeah. They must have left.)
Kajekis 3 and 4 are almost to the first floor, Kiernan and Bryce move to get clear angles... 
TARAS
(Both of them.)
59.
Good signal. So much for surprise. Bryce pistol-whips Taras, dropping him --
--	as 3 and 4 emerge from the basement, SUBMACHINE GUNS coming up --
--	Kiernan and Bryce are on them, slashing, punching -- wrestling for the guns --
--	both Kajekis are good fighters, they don’t go down fast -- but they do go down. 3 is dead, and as Kiernan slashes 4’s throat --
BRYCE
Get down!
-- Kiernan dives --
-- Taras has gotten to a loose submachine gun -- FIRING -- -- WHAMWHAMWHAMWHAM -- Bryce and Kiernan take cover --
EXT. SPUISTRAAT 294 - DAY
The front windows of the house SHATTER, blown out by Taras’s shots -- PEDESTRIANS duck, bewildered --
INT. SPUISTRAAT 294 - DAY
Bryce dives out from cover and SHOOTS Taras -- once in each shoulder, wounding him.
He kicks Taras’s gun away, checks him -- he’s bleeding heavily. Starting to fade.
BRYCE
I need to stop this bleeding. Help me get him downstairs.
But there’s already commotion on the street outside --
KIERNAN
No time. Got to do it on the move.
Kiernan hauls Taras to the door as Bryce races down to the
BASEMENT
and grabs medical supplies, raking bandages and vials into his pockets.
60.
INT. SPUISTRAAT 294 - FIRST FLOOR - DAY
Kiernan struggles to keep Taras on his feet. Bryce joins them at the door. SIRENS already closing in. Bryce runs out to --
EXT. SPUISTRAAT 294 - DAY
CARS waiting at a light. Most of the vehicles are small and underpowered, but there’s a BMW M3 --
-- Bryce aims his machinepistol at the M3’s DRIVER.
BRYCE
Out.
The Driver bails. Bryce takes the wheel.
INT/EXT. BMW M3 (MOVING) / AMSTERDAM STREETS - DAY
Bryce pulls the car around. Kiernan gets in the back, pulling Taras in with him.
As Bryce drives away, Kiernan digs into the medical supplies.
Rips Taras’s shirt open to treat him.
Taras tries to push Kiernan away -- Kiernan calmly holds up his gun in one hand, the bandages in the other.
KIERNAN
(Pick one.)
Taras relents. Kiernan starts dressing his wounds.
They didn’t get out of there fast enough -- the POLICE have already locked onto them. TWO CARS in pursuit and closing.
Bryce tears through the cobbled streets and over the bridges of the Canal Loop -- fast, but not flooring it. Staying in control, trying not to kill any PEDESTRIANS and CYCLISTS.
In the backseat, Kiernan tries to dress Taras’s wounds -- but he’s having a hard time with it. Blood everywhere. Bryce sneaks a look in the rearview.
