BRYCE
I realize this goes against your nature, but the idea is to keep the blood inside the body.
KIERNAN
I’m working on it --
61.
Kiernan glances up -- sees the POLICE CARS closing in --
KIERNAN
Oh Jaysus, maybe try the gas pedal, why don’t you?
BRYCE
It’s not a getaway if we crash.
Kiernan rips open a packet of CELOX (clotting powder) and dumps it over one of Taras’s wounds -- Bryce watches --
BRYCE
Don’t just sprinkle it, you’ve got to pack it in --
KIERNAN
Will you shut up! And stop driving in circles. You stay in one area, the cops will converge --
BRYCE
I know what I’m doing --
Bryce rounds a corner, a POLICE CAR has pulled into the middle of the street ahead of them, blocking the way --
-- Bryce brakes hard.
KIERNAN
No, ram him!
Bryce ignores Kiernan. Stays on the brake. Once he’s almost to a full stop -- he hits the gas again --
--	and drives right into the cop car. At this low speed, it’s not a crash; he’s just pushing the other car out of the way.
BRYCE
Why ram when you can nudge?
Bryce pushes through -- they’re in the clear again, racing down
KERKSTRAAT
It’s a long straightaway, coming up the Magere Brug bridge.
But there are more POLICE CARS bearing down on them.
BRYCE
Think you can drive better? Because I know I can do what you’re doing better.
62.
KIERNAN
Give me the wheel.
Bryce opens the sunroof -- throws the car in neutral -- leaps up to give Kiernan space to crawl in below him --
--	now Kiernan has the wheel. And he absolutely floors it.
Bryce is almost thrown from the car -- he barely manages to climb into the backseat.
Kiernan drives exactly how you’d expect him to. He’s fierce. He drives straight at the oncoming cop cars -- then cuts at the last second, weaving around them, blasting down the road.
Almost to the Magere Brug -- it’s a pedestrian-only bridge, but not today -- Kiernan tears down it -- miraculously not killing anyone --
-- in back, Bryce works on Taras. His hands are sure -- expertly packing in the Celox clotter, applying pressure, and putting on bandages even as the car weaves back and forth.
Bryce keeps his head down the whole time -- he’s intent on his work, and trying not to watch Kiernan’s driving.
Kiernan’s cleared the bridge -- now he’s whipping through the
CITY CENTER
He keeps the M3 at full speed, barely slowing even at blind curves, with utter faith in his instincts and reflexes. The POLICE CARS are starting to fall behind.
Bryce finally looks up -- then looks right back down, shaken.
BRYCE
(to Taras)
I can stop your blood loss and sew you up. But it won’t matter because we’re all going to die.
KIERNAN
Not just yet.
Kiernan cuts down a street -- then has to turn sharply to avoid a LIGHT-RAIL TRAIN as it hums down its track.
Kiernan accelerates, driving parallel to the train, the pursuing CARS right behind them. And up ahead --
--	stalled TRAFFIC. No way to get around it. Kiernan GUNS the engine, straight towards the stopped cars --
63.
--	he’s racing to get past the train -- the gap is narrowing, there’s just a sliver of daylight --
--	Kiernan torques the wheel, cuts right across the front of the train -- to the other side, clear --
--	leaving the police cars behind. Cut off by the train.
Kiernan watches the rearview. No pursuit. Bryce checks Taras.
Wounds dressed, pulse steady. They did it.
Kiernan reaches back his hand. Bryce resists for a moment, then slaps it. High five.
INT. ABANDONED BUILDING - DAY
Busted windows. Dust on the floor. Taras tied to a chair.
Kiernan’s handling the interrogation. Bryce sits by the wall, trying his best to get Taras’s blood out of his clothes. He wants no part of this.
Kiernan paces in front of Taras. Just warming up.
KIERNAN
(How’s your English? I have a lot
of bad memories in Russian.)
TARAS
English fine.
KIERNAN
Nothing to this. I want to know where Demidov’s operating from, and what I’ll find when I get inside. That’s it.
He gestures to the table. The rest of the medical supplies that Bryce gathered are laid out.
KIERNAN
Tell me what I want, and my friend here will shoot you up with a very nice psychotropic cocktail. You’ll see pretty pictures for a few days, then wake up in a hospital bed, good as ever.
Kiernan pulls out a pen and paper. Ready to take it all down.
64.
KIERNAN
But if anything you tell me is wrong, I’ll know where to find you. English fine. Let’s have it.
Taras is silent. Not going to be that easy. Kiernan stands.
Starts to unbutton his shirt.
KIERNAN
I travel a lot for work. Been all over the world. I’ve got souvenirs.
Kiernan pulls off his shirt.
As we already know, Kiernan is in phenomenal physical shape. But now we’re seeing something else -- the gallery of SCARS that blanket his torso.
These are not battlefield scars.
Burns, electrical scars, gashes, gouges...  every single one looks like it was slow and excruciatingly painful.
KIERNAN
(points to a scar)
This one I got from the FARC rebels in Colombia. I was their guest for a couple very long weeks.
(another scar)
This one is from some Congolese
gentlemen.
(another scar)
North Korean special intelligence. A lot of pent-up anger in that country.
(another scar)
Irish Republican Army, if you can believe it. Total misunderstanding. They took me out for pints after. Good lads.
Kiernan’s not explaining what exactly was done to him -- he doesn’t need to.
KIERNAN
(another scar)
This one...  I don’t even remember.
How about that?
Kiernan moves close to Taras. Stare-down.
65.
KIERNAN
You want some souvenirs, too? You
can take a world tour, right here
in this chair. Or talk to me.
Bryce goes to the door. He cannot watch this.
But Taras decided to cooperate a few scars ago.
TARAS
Demidov still controls the Ministry of War. He is making a big weapons sale. Soon. I don’t know who the buyer is. They keep it very quiet. There is a warehouse in Houthaven port. I tell you exactly the place.
Bryce eases back into the room. Kiernan takes a seat, pencil and paper at the ready.
INT. ICC - HALLWAY - DAY
The trial is in recess. Demidov waits on a bench. Livitin comes up to him, holding a PHOTO.
It’s a still from a security camera. A shot of Kiernan and Bryce tearing apart the basement on Spuistraat -- Kiernan’s face is clearly visible.
LIVITIN
(I think he wants payback before he testifies. Your men went after him, now he’s coming after your men.)
Demidov studies the photo.
DEMIDOV
(Fortunately, I have many men.)
EXT. HOUTHAVEN PORT - DAY
Kiernan observes a warehouse through binoculars.
THE WAREHOUSE
is eight stories tall. One side opens directly onto the expanse of the North Channel, with a wet dock.
Kiernan can see numerous GUARDS carrying assault weapons.
They’re all wary, on alert. Kiernan lowers the binoculars.
He’s seen all he needs to.
66.
KIERNAN
Our boy steered us right. Give him his reward.
They’ve switched cars again -- something nondescript. Bryce pops the trunk. Taras is inside, bound and gagged. Bryce preps an injection for him.
BRYCE
We just hit their safehouse.
They’ll have their guard up.
KIERNAN
Know who else had their guard up?
Everyone I’ve ever killed.
Kiernan gets in the car. As Bryce slides the needle into Taras’s arm --
BRYCE
My friend, you are going to enjoy the next few days considerably more than I will.
EXT. EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY
Bryce and Kiernan lay Taras on the ground. He’s unconscious, twitching like he’s dreaming. They get back in the car.
INT. CAR (MOVING) - DAY
Kiernan’s driving. Bryce is still unsettled. Kiernan sees it.
KIERNAN
I wasn’t going to do anything to
that guy. Wasn’t necessary.
BRYCE
(beat)
During my CIA training, they put us through simulated interrogations. It wasn’t my favorite.
KIERNAN
What happened? Did you break?
BRYCE
(yes)
I’ve endured plenty of pain in
combat. Being tortured is... 
different.
67.
KIERNAN
(changing the subject)
To get into that warehouse, we’ll
need to gear up in a serious way.
My Amsterdam storehouse is blown.
BRYCE
Mine’s not.
On Kiernan, surprised.
INT. BRYCE’S STORAGE FACILITY - DAY
Bryce unlocks the unit, codes-out the alarm. Kiernan follows him in. Bryce hits the lights, revealing --
--	his own personal armory. An array of GUNS, WEAPONS, and other EQUIPMENT, all carefully laid out.
Kiernan walks through. Impressed -- and annoyed.
KIERNAN
You didn’t think to mention this earlier? Say, before we walked into that safehouse?
BRYCE
If we had needed to retreat and
resupply, I would have said so.
(beat)
I felt strange about letting a hitman browse through all my gear. But go on, have a look.
Bryce hits a button -- classical MUSIC fills the storehouse.
Kiernan throws him a look, annoyed.
Kiernan goes through the inventory. Weapons, medical equipment, surveillance gear, GPS tracking systems...  Kiernan evaluates it all with an expert’s eye.
Bryce unlocks a case holding a SECURE PHONE. He dials.
INT. ICC - HALLWAY - DAY
Amelia, despondent, walks into the courtroom with the other SPECTATORS. Her phone BUZZES -- unknown number.
AMELIA
Ryder.
68.
BRYCE (ON PHONE)
Hey, Ryder. Get to a hardline.
Leave the number on my voicemail.
Bryce’s voice -- thank God. But Amelia forces herself to look casual. She hangs up and starts down the hall.
INT. BRYCE’S STORAGE FACILITY - DAY
Bryce hangs up, then opens a cabinet -- several SUITS and OVERCOATS hang there, all cleaned and pressed.
KIERNAN
Seriously?
BRYCE
I’m in an image business.
As Bryce starts changing into fresh clothes, he eyes Kiernan, who looks as scruffy as ever.
BRYCE
If you want to spruce up for court, I might have something in your size. Could help make a good impression on the judges.
KIERNAN
Ah, not much for the fancy stuff.
Bryce pulls off his shirt -- Kiernan spots a small SCAR on his torso.
KIERNAN
Tangiers! I did hit you. I knew it.
BRYCE
(busted)
You grazed me. Very slightly.
KIERNAN
Didn’t want to admit it in front of
Amelia, did you?
Bryce shrugs. Kiernan goes back to browsing. He picks up a HANDGUN with an oversized barrel. Next to it are magazines loaded with RUBBER BULLETS.
KIERNAN
Rubber bullets? Are you also
running a day care?
69.
BRYCE
Nonlethal rounds. For situations
where there’s a risk of killing
civilians.
KIERNAN
You are an archangel.
Kiernan flips open a RIFLE CASE...  and stops cold. He stares into the open case with genuine awe. Inside is a gleaming black SNIPER RIFLE.
BRYCE
Yeah.
KIERNAN
This is a... 
BRYCE
Yeah.
KIERNAN
... a McMillan L15X Super Magnum.
BRYCE
Chambered with three thirty eight
Lapua Magnum. Go ahead.
Kiernan carefully takes the rifle from its case. Fits the scope to the stock. Feels its weight in his hands.
KIERNAN
They only made... 
BRYCE
... ten of them, before the patent
suit from H&K. Tragedy. Finest
rifle anyone ever shot.
The MESSAGE LIGHT on Bryce’s secure phone is blinking. He checks his voicemail.
KIERNAN
You take care of this, right? You
break it down and re-oil it--?
BRYCE
--every two months.
KIERNAN
Do it every month.
Kiernan drops a .338 round into the chamber. While he geeks out with the rifle, Bryce dials a number.
70.
INT. ICC - SIDE OFFICE - DAY
Amelia’s alone. Door closed. She picks up in half a ring.
INTERCUT AMELIA & BRYCE
AMELIA
Are you alright and where the hell are you?
BRYCE
We’re both fine. Slight change of
plans, but all is well.
AMELIA
Thank God. You’re not talking to
Amelia now. This is Agent Ryder.
Where are you?
BRYCE
(beat)
Amsterdam.
AMELIA
Really? That is so wonderful. And
how are the hookers, Michael?
BRYCE
Long story. We’ll be there soon.
Kiernan grins -- it’s fun watching Bryce take a scolding.
AMELIA
There is too much riding on this. I need to know what is going on and I need to be there with you.
BRYCE
Absolutely not. It’s too dangerous.
AMELIA
The other option is, I tell Casoria to put a red notice out on both of you. That’s you on every wire all over Europe. What’s it going to be?
BRYCE
Can you put Amelia back on?
AMELIA
Michael.
Bryce gives Kiernan a sour look. He’s stuck.
71.
INT. ICC - HALLWAY - DAY
Amelia emerges from the side office and heads for the exit, slipping through the milling CROWD.
No one takes any notice of her, except --
Ivanov.
He signals to Oleg and Petr. They start tailing her.
INT. ICC - TRIAL CHAMBER 1 - DAY
Casoria is taking his seat. His cell phone BUZZES. An email from Amelia:
“Trust me for one day more.”
Casoria sees she’s not in the gallery. Considers his options. Starts to say something to the AGENT next to him -- then holds off. He settles in to wait. Not thrilled about it.
INT. AMSTERDAM STATION CENTRAAL - DAY
Amelia gets off the NS train. Heads right for the lockers.
Oleg and Petr get off the train a few moments after her. They shadow Amelia, switching off to avoid being spotted. They’re both wearing earpieces.
AT THE LOCKERS
Amelia sits on a bench, feels under her seat -- a LOCKER KEY is taped there. She goes to the locker, opens it. Inside: a CELL PHONE. She hits redial.
KIERNAN (ON PHONE)
Buy a Metro ticket for the fifty-three line towards Gaasperplas. You need to be on the next train.
She’s already moving --
--	Oleg, seeing Amelia on a cell, pulls a small DEVICE from his bag. Jacks it into his earpiece.
As Oleg scrolls through his display, We HEAR snippets of PEOPLE TALKING -- he’s tapping into all the cell-phone conversations around him. His device is an IMSI CATCHER.
Oleg keeps scrolling, finds the call he wants:
72.
AMELIA (ON PHONE)
I see it. I’m going there now... 
Oleg follows after her.
INT. AT THE TICKET KIOSK - DAY
Ticket in hand, Amelia rushes towards the network of tunnels leading to the Metro trains.
Oleg trails her, farther back in the crowd of TRAVELERS.
KIERNAN (ON PHONE) Take a seat in the center car. You’ll lose service. But keep this phone on you.
As Amelia goes
AROUND A CORNER
someone falls in next to her -- BRYCE. He puts a finger to his lips. Squeezes her hand, a silent hello.
As he leads her towards the wall, he plucks the phone from her hand. Kiernan is still giving instructions:
KIERNAN (ON PHONE) Redial this number at every stop and every time the train goes above ground... 
Bryce drops the phone into a PASSERBY’s shoulder bag -- then guides Amelia through a SIDE DOOR --
--	just before Oleg comes around the corner. Oleg scans the crowd -- he’s lost sight of Amelia for the moment, but Kiernan’s VOICE is still in his ear --
--	Oleg continues walking calmly along.
INT. SERVICE CORRIDOR - DAY
Bryce shuts the door. Kiernan is here, on a cell. He continues giving decoy instructions into the phone:
KIERNAN
... if we haven’t made contact again, get off at Gaasperplas. Wait at the south end of the terminal.
73.
Bryce wands Amelia with an electronic SENSOR -- sweeping for tracking beacons. She’s clean.
Kiernan dumps the cell. The three of them run down the corridor, vanishing into the bowels of the station.
INT. AMSTERDAM STATION CENTRAAL - DAY
Oleg and Petr are standing outside the 53 train. Frantically scanning the PASSENGERS -- no Amelia.
As the train doors close, Ivanov comes down the escalator.
Sees the look of defeat on Oleg and Petr. His eyes narrow.
INT. BUILDING UNDER CONSTRUCTION - DAY
The Amsterdam outskirts. Skyscrapers going up everywhere. We’re in the shell of a new building -- high up, with a stunning view of the old city.
The floor is covered with Bryce’s usual exhaustive advance work -- architectural blueprints, recon photos, maps, etc.
Amelia is more than a little unnerved.
AMELIA
Guys...  isn’t this something you
can hand off to the police?
BRYCE
The prosecution has to rest in two days. To get a warrant, based solely on the word of a runaway hitman, would take months.
KIERNAN
And if Demidov has eyes inside Interpol, you know he’s tight with the local cops.
AMELIA
Then your plan is to go in,
commandeer a couple tanks, and
drive them to the Hague?
KIERNAN
We don’t need the weapons. The weapons do nothing for us. We need the paperwork.
(off her look, confused)
How much do you know about selling arms on the black market?
74.
AMELIA
It’s not a hobby.
Kiernan hands her a printout. It’s of an official-looking DOCUMENT, adorned with seals and stamps.
KIERNAN
This is an “end-user certificate.” These are how weapons move about the world. If Kajekistan wants to sell fifty Stinger missiles to, say, China, that’s legal. China just supplies a document certifying they’re the end user of the missiles, and the shipment sails right through. But if you want to sell those same fifty Stingers to a bunch of terrorists, that’s a bit tougher. You can’t hide large-scale arms inside a banana crate, you have to ship them in the open. So you get an end-user certificate from a legit customer -- either forge it or bribe somebody -- and then divert the shipment.
AMELIA
So whatever weapons are in that
warehouse --
KIERNAN
--	arrived here with fake end-user certificates. That evidence puts Demidov away.
BRYCE
It’s not glamorous, but it works.
Like getting Capone on tax evasion.
AMELIA
But they know you’re coming.
KIERNAN
They think I’m coming to kill them.
They don’t know I need evidence.
BRYCE
They’re preparing for a full-on
assault. We’re just going to slip
in and take a few papers.
Amelia is thinking it over. She pulls Bryce aside.
75.
AMELIA
I asked you to help. But now this
has gone way beyond. If you’re
doing it for me...  don’t.
BRYCE
I’m doing this because it has to
get done.
KIERNAN
I won’t let him get hurt.
That gets a little smile from Amelia. She nods. Okay.
INT. BRYCE’S STORAGE FACILITY - NIGHT
Kiernan and Bryce preparing for the assault. GUNS and GEAR are spread out everywhere.
KIERNAN
When we get in there, don’t expect me to play the client. This is too heavy for me to take a backseat.
BRYCE
Agreed. You and I work pretty well together. That means together. Don’t try to do it all yourself.
They keep working. Checking and rechecking.
INT. AMELIA’S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
Nothing fancy. Low-end corporate. A KNOCK on the door.
Staccato, like a code. Amelia answers. It’s Bryce.
AMELIA
I thought you didn’t believe in
pregame activity.
BRYCE
I’m just here to talk.
She lets him in. He’s carrying two cans of soda.
BRYCE
I know this place isn’t up to our usual travel standards. But I got you a gift: a blackcurrant soda. A local delicacy, available only in the vending machine down the hall.
76.
AMELIA
Ooh.
They drink. It’s awful. They set the cans down.
BRYCE
And that is why.
AMELIA
I shouldn’t have forced you to bring me up here. I didn’t need to come. But...  I did need to.
BRYCE
I’m glad you’re here. I told you I wasn’t doing this for you... 
(beat)
I’m very good at certain things.
And very bad at everything else.
(beat)
I’ve never told you how much--
Amelia senses an “I love you” coming. She stops him.
AMELIA
You’re going off to war. You may not know what you’re feeling. When this is all over with, if there’s something you want to say to me... 
Bryce hauls her in for a kiss. With a sudden, fierce intensity. She responds. They need each other now. He moves her to the bed.
She holds him tightly. She doesn’t want to say it, but she’s afraid for him.
EXT. HOUTHAVEN PORT - NIGHT
Dead of night. Everything is still.
The only activity in the port is at the warehouse -- it’s being heavily patrolled by Kajekistani COMMANDOS.
Several man the roof, some stand guard outside, we see others in the windows. A formidable defense force.
ON THE WATER
Several small BOATS are scattered throughout the inlet.
Watchposts on the dark water.
77.
One boat floats close to the warehouse. Two Kajeki COMMANDOS onboard. One checks the time, gets on the radio:
COMMANDO
(Russian, subtitled)
(Position one. All clear.)
As soon as he clicks off -- THWIP -- THWIP -- two silenced BULLETS, both Commandos fall --
-- Kiernan’s head sinks back beneath the surface.
THE WAREHOUSE
Kiernan and Bryce swim to it, cutting silently through the water. The outer stone of the building is worn and gouged by erosion -- plenty of handholds.
Kiernan and Bryce free-climb the structure. Two shadows in black wetsuits. Bryce has a large DUFFEL on his back.
They reach a lower window. Kiernan peers in. Dark. He pops the hinge with a small pry bar. Lets the glass panel slide into the water.
They’re in.
INT. THE WAREHOUSE - SIDE ROOM - NIGHT
They’re in a small storage space. Empty.
Bryce unzips the waterproof duffel -- it’s full of WEAPONS and GEAR. They change into dry clothes and start arming themselves. Heavily.
Bryce pulls out a small laptop. He types a few commands -- his screen fills with images from numerous SECURITY CAMERAS. He’s hacked into the warehouse’s security system.
Kajeki COMMANDOS are patrolling everywhere. Looks like there are SEVERAL DOZEN spread throughout the building.
BRYCE
Did they bring the whole country?
KIERNAN
I’d be insulted if they didn’t.
Kiernan opens the hallway door, just a crack. Bryce checks the camera feed, making sure the doorway is in a blind spot. It is.
78.
Bryce and Kiernan watch the movement of the patrols, the patterns. Then they see what they’re looking for -- TWO COMMANDOS heading down the hallway towards them.
Kiernan moves to the door -- waits --
INT. WAREHOUSE - SECURITY ROOM - NIGHT
A Kajeki OPERATOR sits at a huge bank of MONITORS. He’s watching the same footage as Bryce and Kiernan. We see the two Commandos walk out of frame --
INT. WAREHOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT
--	Kiernan steps into the doorway -- THWIP -- THWIP -- he SHOOTS both Commandos -- they drag the bodies into the
SIDE ROOM
Bryce and Kiernan put on the Commandos’ coats and hats, and take their radios.
A few more clicks on the laptop -- now the SECURITY FEED is transferred to Bryce’s PHONE. They’ll have eyes on the whole building as they move. They head into the empty hallway.
INT. SECURITY ROOM - NIGHT
To the Operator, it all appears normal. Bryce and Kiernan, now wearing the Commandos’ clothes, look like just another patrol team moving down the hall.
INT. WAREHOUSE - CORRIDORS - NIGHT
Bryce has memorized the building’s layout, and he can watch the other patrols on his phone. He and Kiernan slip through the warehouse, changing directions and ducking into side rooms to avoid running into anyone.
It’s not easy -- the warehouse is crawling with COMMANDOS -- but so far, so good.
Bryce opens an old FUSE BOX and clips a small ELECTRONIC DEVICE to the switches. Then they head into --
INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT
Cameras on every landing. Fewer outs now.
79.
They quickly climb a few floors. Bryce keeps an eye on the security feed -- problem --
--	two COMMANDOS are about to enter the stairwell a few floors above them --
--	Bryce yanks Kiernan through a doorway --
INT. FOURTH FLOOR - NIGHT
An exposed walkway; they stand back out of sight. They can see more patrolling COMMANDOS, mostly on the lower floors.
Now they also have a view of the cavernous interior of the warehouse --
-- and the huge cache of WEAPONS arrayed on the bottom level.
Mostly large sealed CRATES, but we can see a few surface-to-air MISSILE LAUNCHERS and several FAST-ATTACK VEHICLES -- open jeeps with machine guns mounted on them. There are also rows of EXPLOSIVE ORDNANCE, heavy SHOULDER-MOUNTED WEAPONS... 
... Bryce keeps watching his phone -- bigger problem --
--	more COMMANDOS are about to come around the corner -- the two Commandos on the stairs are heading down to their floor -- they’re going to be boxed in.
They slip back into the stairwell, the least bad option --
INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT
The two Commandos come down the stairs. Bryce and Kiernan lower their heads and walk by, mumbling a greeting --
-- the Commandos nod hello and walk past, it worked --
--	no, it didn’t. The second Commando turns back, wanting a better look, going for his radio --
--	a KNIFE appears in Kiernan’s hand, Bryce hits a button on his phone --
INT. FIRST-FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT
The fuse box that Bryce rigged -- a tiny POP from within -- the LIGHTBULBS along the hall flash and EXPLODE --
80.
INT. SECURITY ROOM - NIGHT
The FLASH of the exploding bulbs draws the Operator’s eye to that screen, so he’s not watching --
INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT
--	Kiernan quickly kills both Commandos. Bryce and Kiernan each grab a corpse and haul them up a few more steps to --
INT. FIFTH FLOOR - NIGHT
They dump the Commandos’ bodies in a blind spot.
Glassed-in offices ring the perimeter of the warehouse, connected by walkways. Bryce and Kiernan head for a small office. They’re almost running now.
INT. SECURITY ROOM - NIGHT
The Operator scans the hall where the light bulbs popped. He completely missed Bryce and Kiernan killing the Commandos.
INT. FIFTH-FLOOR OFFICE - NIGHT
Bryce and Kiernan slip inside. A couple of desks and a heavy
SAFE in one corner. Jackpot. Kiernan quickly examines it.
Bryce stands guard, checking his phone --
--	two more COMMANDOS have entered the stairwell where they just killed the other two. Bryce can only watch as they take a look around --
INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT
Bryce and Kiernan cleared the bodies, so the Commandos don’t see anything unusual. But as they start down the stairs --
-- one notices a dark stain on the floor. He touches it -- -- fresh blood. He fumbles for his radio.
INT. FIFTH-FLOOR OFFICE - NIGHT
The radios Bryce and Kiernan took off the Commandos start CRACKLING. Yelling in RUSSIAN, overlapping voices.
They just got made. Bryce hits a button on his phone --
81.
INT. SECURITY ROOM - NIGHT
On the MONITORS, we see COMMANDOS racing around -- the whole warehouse is going into battle mode. Then -- all the screens go BLACK. Bryce just killed their feed.
INT. WAREHOUSE - GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT
Ivanov is here among the crates, flanked by Oleg and Petr. As the ALARM sounds, he gets very still. Thinking, calculating.
INT. FIFTH-FLOOR OFFICE - NIGHT
Kiernan has checked out the safe --
KIERNAN
This would take hours to crack.
Going to have to blow it.
Bryce doesn’t like that, but there’s no choice. Kiernan packs C-4 EXPLOSIVE around the safe’s hinges -- they stand back --
-- BOOM.
ON THE LOWER FLOORS
There was no missing the EXPLOSION. The Commandos zero in on Kiernan and Bryce.
INT. FIFTH-FLOOR OFFICE - NIGHT
Bryce extinguishes the last of the FLAMES -- Kiernan kicks away the charred, mangled door -- digs through the safe --
KIERNAN
Got em. Got em.
Kiernan pulls out a sheaf of documents -- END-USER CERTIFICATES, like what he showed Amelia. He flips through --
BRYCE
We’re good?
KIERNAN
We’re perfect.
Kiernan opens a thin METAL CASE -- slips the certificates inside, then straps it to his chest.
They move back into the
82.
HALLWAY
and dump their silenced weapons. Bryce draws his machinepistols, and Kiernan hoists a SUBMACHINE GUN.
The stealth portion of the evening is now over.
They encounter resistance right away. Several COMMANDOS pour out of the stairwell --
--	but Bryce is still wired into the security cameras through his phone, he can see the attacks coming --
--	he and Kiernan tear the Commandos apart. Once everyone is dead, they step over the bodies and run into the
STAIRWELL
both FIRING, dropping more Commandos.
Then it gets quiet for a moment. The rest of the Commandos haven’t gotten to them yet. And Bryce and Kiernan --
-- do nothing.
They’re on the fifth floor of an eight-story building, with several dozen armed men racing up towards them, and --
-- they just wait.
They calmly reload, listening to the FOOTSTEPS pounding up towards them, getting closer...  and...  now.
Bryce and Kiernan run up the stairs --
INT. EXIT STAIRS - NIGHT
They’re one flight below the roof.
Kiernan lays more C-4 EXPLOSIVE at the base of the final staircase. He and Bryce run up to the
EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT
and get the drop on the two COMMANDOS still at their posts, killing them both.
They’re alone on the roof. But not for long, because the Commandos are almost to the final stairwell --
-- Kiernan pulls out a DETONATOR, punches the button --
83.
--	BLOWING THE STAIRCASE beneath them. There’s no way to get onto the roof now. Or to get off it.
The BOATS have drawn in closer -- their SEARCHLIGHTS illuminate the inlet. A water escape’s no good.
But Bryce and Kiernan are already running to the other side of the building -- solid ground below. They put on CLIMBING HARNESSES, uncoil ROPES, and fix an ANCHOR into the roof.
INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
Ivanov was in the crowd of Commandos going for the roof -- as the SMOKE clears from the explosion, his Commandos are confused, YELLING --
IVANOV
(Quiet! Everyone quiet.)
He listens. Nothing.
IVANOV
(No helicopter...  everyone get to
the windows.)
EXT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
Bryce and Kiernan RAPPEL down the face of the building.
Bryce is harnessed with his back to the ground, Kiernan is facing the ground -- between them, they have a 360-degree range of fire.
COMMANDOS begin appearing at the windows, trying to get a lock on their position -- Bryce and Kiernan open FIRE at every face that emerges -- it’s vertical Wack-A-Mole.
They’ve dropped their ropes directly between windows, so the Commandos can’t reach them.
Then the recoil from a burst pushes Kiernan too close to a window -- just as a COMMANDO leans out -- Kiernan knocks the Commando’s gun aside --
--	but the Commando grabs onto Kiernan -- he’s trying to tear Kiernan’s hands off the rope, sending him into free-fall --
--	Bryce laying down COVER FIRE --
--	Kiernan has to let go of his GUN -- it clatters all the way to the ground as he wrestles with the Commando -- he’s barely hanging on --
84.
--	Kiernan clamps down on his descender, locking himself in place on the rope -- has both hands free now --
--	he grabs the slack rope beneath him, wraps it around the Commando’s neck -- hauls him out of the window --
--	Kiernan THROTTLES the Commando with his climbing rope. The Commando goes limp, his neck broken --
--	Kiernan lets the body fall to the ground.
BRYCE
Coming to you!
Bryce throws Kiernan a fresh SUBMACHINE GUN. Kiernan plucks the weapon out of the air, is FIRING a quarter-second later.
As Bryce continues his descent -- a sudden JERK on his rope. He looks up --
AT A WINDOW
high above him, another COMMANDO has climbed out on the ledge, he’s cutting through Bryce’s rope --
--	Bryce FIRES -- killing the Commando -- the body falls straight towards him, Bryce swings to dodge -- his rope is now FRAYING where the Commando cut it. Almost gone --
--	Bryce swings to a ledge, scrambling for a firm grip -- just as his rope BREAKS --
--	Bryce FALLS -- catches himself on the ledge -- slowly pulling himself up --
--	another COMMANDO bursts into the room Bryce is hanging outside of -- Bryce drops back down, dangling from the window, making himself a small target --
--	the Commando runs to the window and leans down, FIRING -- but Bryce isn’t there.
Bryce is now standing on the ledge, off to the side -- he SHOOTS the Commando point-blank. Bryce climbs back
INSIDE
He uncoils a fresh rope, secures it to a pipe, hooks in -- ready. He swings back
OUTSIDE
He and Kiernan continue their descent, side-by-side -- then a sudden TUG on Kiernan’s rope -- they look up --
85.
-- now Kiernan’s rope is being cut, by another COMMANDO.
BRYCE
To me!
Bryce swings towards Kiernan, Kiernan towards him --
--	as Kiernan’s rope is sliced clean through -- Kiernan is free in space, he jumps for it, pushing off the building --
--	and catches ahold of Bryce’s rope.
Kiernan’s hanging just above Bryce, but he’s not hooked in. It’s only a few more stories to the ground --
BRYCE
Go?
KIERNAN
Go!
-- Bryce unhooks himself, too --
--	they FAST-ROPE straight down -- a pure free-fall, with just the friction of their bodies on the rope to slow them.
Bryce lands first, clears the ground for Kiernan. He hurls a STUN GRENADE into the air -- it detonates, blinding the Commandos at the windows --
-- as Kiernan lands, a little too hard, on his bad leg --
--	Kiernan gets up limping, but he can still move. They run along the side of the warehouse, into the darkness --
INT. FIFTH-FLOOR OFFICE - NIGHT
Far from the combat, Ivanov runs into the office. He sees the exploded safe, the scattered papers -- realization hits.
He knows what they came here for.
EXT. HOUTHAVEN PORT - NIGHT
Bryce and Kiernan run away from the warehouse, towards a high fence. Beyond it, the outer ring of the AMSTERDAM CANALS --
-- and Amelia, waiting in a SPEEDBOAT.
Bryce has a few steps on Kiernan -- he scales the fence, perches on top, turns around --
86.
-- and FIRES on the Commandos pouring out of the warehouse.
Kiernan gets to the fence. Tries to climb -- can’t. His leg won’t take the weight.
Bryce reaches his hand down -- Kiernan’s about to grab it, but then he sees --
ON THE WATER
The Kajekis’ SPEEDBOATS are roaring out of the inlet, heading for the canals.
The speedboat escape won’t be a clean getaway.
AT THE FENCE
Kiernan watches the boats close in. He pulls his hand back.
He’s not going over the fence.
BRYCE
What are you doing--?
KIERNAN
Draw them away from me. I’ll meet
you at the rendezvous.
Kiernan’s serious, he’s going to run for it on his own --
BRYCE
Sean, no--!
The Commandos running out of the warehouse are closing in, FIRING -- Bryce is an easy target up on the fence. He jumps down, landing on the canal side.
Bryce and Kiernan face each other across the fence. A final moment before they split up.
BRYCE
We have a speedboat. You’re on
foot. At least give me the case.
Kiernan unstraps the case, almost throws it over -- doesn’t.
KIERNAN
I’ll make it.
Kiernan tucks the case under his arm. Runs. Bryce doesn’t waste time on anger. He runs to the
87.
EXT. CANAL - NIGHT
and leaps into the speedboat. Amelia guns the ENGINE --
BRYCE
He’s got the certificates.
AMELIA
Where the hell is he going?
BRYCE
I’ll tell you in a second.
Bryce opens a compartment, pulls out a GPS TRACKER -- we saw it in his storage unit. He powers it up.
BRYCE
I put a beacon on him in case he
did something incredibly stupid.
Like exactly this.
Bryce takes the helm. Turns them to follow Kiernan.
