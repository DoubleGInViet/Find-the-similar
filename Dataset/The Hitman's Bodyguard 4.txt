EXT. AMSTERDAM STREETS - NIGHT
Kiernan knifes through the narrow streets, trying to disappear into the city. If he was healthy, he could do it -- but now he’s down a step.
FOOTSTEPS and car ENGINES are all around him. The Commandos closing in.
EXT. SPEEDBOAT (MOVING) - NIGHT
Bryce tries to stay close to Kiernan, following the BEACON display on his tracker.
But the two KAJEKI SPEEDBOATS are coming up from behind --
BRYCE
Get down!
Amelia hits the deck as GUNFIRE from the pursuing boats caroms off the canal walls.
Bryce evades, whipping under a bridge. He rips something from his belt -- chunks of C-4 and DETONATORS.
BRYCE
Rig these.
As Amelia jams a detonator into each chunk of C-4 --
88.
EXT. AMSTERDAM STREETS - NIGHT
Kiernan runs up a staircase, starts racing across the
ROOFTOPS
The Commandos are everywhere, swarming, trying to get a bead on him from the street.
Kiernan ignores the pain -- through sheer force of will -- somehow, he’s almost at a full sprint.
EXT. CANALS - NIGHT
Bryce is still cat-and-mouse with the Kajeki speedboats.
Amelia’s wired each chunk of C-4 with a detonator.
They’re coming up on a tight turn -- a line of ROWBOATS is tied up by the wall.
BRYCE
Throw them in.
As Bryce whips through the turn, Amelia hurls chunks of C-4 into the empty boats.
Bryce grabs the REMOTE DETONATOR -- as the pursuing boats come around the turn, he hits the button --
--	all the C-4 charges go off at once.
The BLAST engulfs the pursuing speedboats --
-- both Kajeki boats are now dead FIREBALLS on the water.
Bryce checks the tracking beacon. He guns the engine -- back in pursuit of Kiernan.
EXT. ROOFTOPS - NIGHT
Kiernan comes to a gap in the roofs, he’ll have to jump it -- he forces himself to sprint even faster, ignoring the pain --
-- Kiernan reaches the edge of the roof, springs off, JUMPS --
--	and makes it. Just barely. He almost cries out from the pain in his leg -- but he’s still going.
89.
EXT. CANALS - NIGHT
Bryce checks the beacon -- Kiernan’s close. He brings the boat to a stop by the wall.
BRYCE
Get clear of here. We’ll meet you
at the rendezvous.
Bryce climbs onto solid ground. Amelia takes the helm and speeds off into the darkness.
Bryce runs down the street, GPS tracker in hand. Hunting.
EXT. ROOFTOPS - NIGHT
Kiernan, still going. He comes to another gap in the roofs, makes another jump --
-- but as he’s in midair --
ON THE STREET BELOW
-- Petr is there, waiting, he has a clear shot, FIRES --
--	the BULLET tears into Kiernan’s arm, the one holding the metal case --
--	Kiernan lands on the far roof, he made it -- but the impact JARS THE CASE LOOSE --
--	Kiernan is still rolling forward, the case is sliding away from him, he tries to turn, counter his momentum --
--	the case now skittering towards the edge of the roof --
--	Kiernan diving for it -- almost to it --
--	no --
--	THE CASE GOES OFF THE ROOF.
Kiernan runs forward, peers over the edge -- and almost gets torn apart by a fusillade of BULLETS from below.
The case has fallen into a group of COMMANDOS. They unload on Kiernan -- it’s a wall of lead. Nothing he can do.
More Commandos are racing across the rooftops, closing. Kiernan runs to another edge of the roof, leaps onto a
BALCONY
90.
with a view of where the case fell. Petr has already scooped it up -- throws it into a waiting SUV -- the ENGINE guns --
-- gone. The case is gone.
Kiernan just stands there. Shattered. Oblivious to the danger around him. For the moment, he just does not care.
INT. SUV (MOVING) - NIGHT
Ivanov is in the back seat. He opens the case. Flips through the end-user certificates. On his cell:
IVANOV
(I’ve recovered the items.)
INT. LIVITIN’S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
Livitin, on his cell.
LIVITIN
(Now clear the warehouse. And get
both men. I want this done with.)
INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
KAJEKIS are securing the weapons for transport. Loading them onto trucks. Frantic, working double-time.
EXT. ROOFTOPS - NIGHT
The Commandos race to the edge of the roof, reaching the
BALCONY
where we last saw Kiernan. But now he’s gone.
EXT. AMSTERDAM STREETS - NIGHT
Kiernan hobbles down the street, making his escape. Numb.
He stops. Leans against a building. Even with his phenomenal conditioning and pain tolerance...  he’s spent.
SIRENS, but far away. And no sign of the Commandos.
There’s a church across the street. Kiernan tries the door.
It’s open. He goes in.
91.
INT. CHURCH - NIGHT
Kiernan’s not a religious man. Just needs a quiet place. He sits in a back pew. Stares at nothing. Closes his eyes.
When he hears a GUN being cocked, he doesn’t even react.
Maybe he’s hoping it’s over.
Bryce has come in. Kiernan is mildly surprised to see him.
Bryce is about to ask -- but he can see Kiernan’s empty hands. The expression on his face. The question isn’t even necessary.
Bryce sits. Both men are on empty.
BRYCE
By now, they’ve rolled up the whole operation. Cleared the warehouse.
KIERNAN
Yeah.
BRYCE
That was our shot.
KIERNAN
Yeah. How did you find me?
Bryce touches the back of his neck. Kiernan reaches -- finds the tiny TRACKING BEACON hooked into the back of his shirt.
A tired smile from Kiernan. It’s almost funny to him.
BRYCE
What now? Do you testify?
KIERNAN
Might as well. I’ll be at the hotel for awhile, working on my leg.
BRYCE
I’m going to the rendezvous. I need to tell Amelia what’s happened.
KIERNAN
I can get to the Hague by myself.
BRYCE
(beat)
Is that how you want it?
KIERNAN
Put you through enough, haven’t I?
92.
Bryce goes to Kiernan. Hands him something: the five-euro note. That’s their goodbye. As Bryce heads for the door --
KIERNAN
Michael.
(Bryce stops)
My life got set on a path early. By the time I was old enough to know what I wanted for myself, I was already a fugitive on three continents. Janet and I never had a chance. My life was always going to catch up to me someday.
(beat)
You found a good girl. Don’t screw it up. That’s the last of the moral guidance from Sean Kiernan.
Bryce leaves.
EXT. AMSTERDAM STREETS - NIGHT
Bryce walks through the empty streets. No need to hurry now.
On the horizon -- FIRST LIGHT.
The city is just starting to glow under the sun.
As Bryce takes in the beauty of it all...  there’s almost no change in his stride or expression -- he’s careful not to betray a reaction, but -- he knows he’s not alone.
The threat is close. Bryce scans the streets and alleys, mapping escape routes. And now --
--	he breaks into a sprint, MACHINEPISTOLS out -- he SHOOTS the two KAJEKIS lying in wait ahead of him --
--	but MORE KAJEKIS pour out of the alleys, he’s surrounded --
--	a soft POP, a BUZZ -- Bryce is struck by two TASER DARTS -- he goes down. His guns go flying.
SIX KAJEKIS descend on him. Bryce recovers, draws a KNIFE, kills one but then loses his blade, now it’s hand-to-hand, Bryce is a blur, a machine --
-- it takes all five Kajekis to finally bring him down.
Zipcuffs. Duct tape. Captured. An SUV tears out of the alley, they bundle Bryce inside, flooring it --
93.
INT. SUV (MOVING) - CONTINUOUS
Ivanov sits across from Bryce. Holding the metal case.
Bryce only has a moment to appreciate the irony -- the certificates are right in front of him -- before the hood is pulled down over his head.
INT. BUILDING UNDER CONSTRUCTION - MORNING
The rendezvous point. Kiernan limps up the stairs. He’s carrying a nearly-empty bottle of whiskey. He’s hammered.
KIERNAN
Hey. Guys? Hello?
But he’s the only one here. To the empty space:
KIERNAN
I’m sorry. I am really sorry.
There, I said it. Can I go now?
He wanders over to the edge to catch the view. Spots a large
PACKAGE tucked behind a pillar, wrapped in plain brown paper.
A note on top: “Sean.” He opens it, reads:
“I doubt they’ll let you keep this in your cell. But I want you to have it. Michael.”
Kiernan unwraps the paper -- it’s Bryce’s SNIPER RIFLE.
Footsteps on the stairs. Amelia.
KIERNAN
Ah, Amelia. It’s a long story. With an unhappy ending.
That hits her hard. But even worse --
AMELIA
Michael’s not with you--?
KIERNAN
I’m sure he’ll be along soon.
AMELIA
He’s never late. For anything.
Fear in her eyes.
94.
INT. BASEMENT - DAY
The hood is pulled off Bryce’s head. A bright LIGHT shines down on him. He’s tied to a table, spread-eagle.
Ivanov, Oleg, Petr, and a few other KAJEKIS all around him.
Ivanov pulls up a chair so they can chat.
IVANOV
You know what these are, yes?
Of course -- Ivanov is holding up the stack of end-user certificates, tucked in the metal case.
IVANOV
I believe we have all of them back.
Am I correct?
(Bryce nods)
Good. Then we have only one more
small piece of business. Where is
Sean Kiernan?
BRYCE
I have no idea.
Bryce is a good liar. But not good enough to beat Ivanov.
IVANOV
You are Michael Bryce, formerly of the Central Intelligence Agency. I showed your picture to some associates. You are well-known in certain circles.
Ivanov gestures for Oleg to come over. He’s carrying something. Bryce strains, trying to see... 
IVANOV
I heard a story about you being
interrogated.
Oleg is carrying a CAR BATTERY.
Bryce goes white. He’s been through this before. He tries to put on a brave face, but finds himself pulling desperately at his bonds.
IVANOV
Memories, yes? A bit old-fashioned, but so effective.
(Russian, to the others)
(This won’t take long.)
95.
The others LAUGH. Bryce’s breathing is fast, jagged. He’s almost hyperventilating. He knows exactly what’s coming.
Oleg wraps a leather strap around Bryce’s head. Connects the wires at his temples. Two more wires go around his feet. Ready to go.
IVANOV
Where is Sean Kiernan?
Bryce doesn’t answer. Trying to prepare himself. Ivanov signals. As Oleg brings the wires to the battery --
BRYCE
Wait. Wait wait wait.
Oleg stops. A faint smile from Ivanov.
BRYCE
Kiernan needed the certificates because he has no testimony. Do you understand? He’s not dangerous to you now. He doesn’t matter.
IVANOV
I see. This is good. If Kiernan does not matter, then you can tell me where he is. It’s of no concern. So. Where is he?
BRYCE
(beat)
Don’t.
Ivanov signals -- Oleg touches the wires to the battery, COMPLETING THE CIRCUIT --
--	Bryce HOWLS. He shakes and thrashes against his bonds. His body convulses as the CURRENT surges through him.
This goes on for some time.
At last, Oleg turns off the power.
Bryce pulls in huge, teary panic breaths.
This isn’t a hardened operative absorbing punishment. The agony is instant and overwhelming.
Bryce just wants it to stop.
IVANOV
Where is Sean Kiernan?
96.
Bryce almost gives him the answer. He almost does. But he holds back. Ivanov signals -- the CURRENT is turned back on.
Bryce SCREAMS. Ivanov watches, impassive. Oleg starts to turn the power off -- Ivanov signals him to keep going.
Thin tendrils of SMOKE begin to rise from Bryce’s temples.
The other Kajekis turn away. Even for them, this is hard to watch. Finally, the power is turned off.
IVANOV
Where is Sean Kiernan?
BRYCE
He’s...  somewhere safe.
(beat)
He’s very, very safe.
Ivanov is surprised. They all are. It looked like this was over. But Bryce just went deeper inside himself. And found something more.
Ivanov motions Petr to come over. He’s wearing heavy rubber gloves. Carrying something.
It’s nothing out of the ordinary -- just a plastic bucket, full of WATER. Petr pours out a little so Bryce can see.
BRYCE
Go ahead, asshole.
Petr DOUSES Bryce with the water --
-- the POWER is turned back on, the CURRENT flows again -- the water conducts it throughout Bryce’s body --
-- it’s an entirely new level of pain -- SPARKS pop and fly --
--	but Bryce doesn’t talk. He doesn’t even scream. He simply endures.
Lost in the agony, Bryce’s vision BLURS. Everything goes fuzzy. He’s only dimly aware as a few BURSTS of LIGHT begin to appear at the edges of his vision.
They’re MUZZLE FLASHES.
One, then another, then another...  then many more.
Bryce doesn’t even realize what’s happening:
KIERNAN IS KILLING EVERYONE IN THE ROOM.
97.
Even drunk -- and he most certainly is drunk -- Kiernan’s utterly lethal. It doesn’t take him long.
Kiernan stops firing. He knows he’s killed everybody, but for a moment, he’s not sure where he is.
Bryce is slowly coming back to the world. Now Kiernan is standing over him, undoing his bonds.
KIERNAN
I didn’t trust you, either.
Kiernan pulls something off Bryce’s pant leg -- a tiny TRACKING BEACON.
KIERNAN
But damn, I should have.
Kiernan clasps Bryce’s hand. He’s holding something -- the five-euro note. He’s giving it back to Bryce.
BRYCE
Are you drunk?
KIERNAN
Aye.
Bryce smiles. He looks off to the side. Kiernan follows his gaze...  to the metal case, holding the end-user certificates.
EXT. ALLEY - DAY
Amelia waiting anxiously. Hand on her gun.
Bryce and Kiernan stumble out of the building. Not a pretty sight. Kiernan is limping and drunk, Bryce is still weak from the torture. But they’re triumphant -- they’ve got the case.
Amelia runs to them. She can see that Bryce has been through something horrible. She looks in his eyes: what happened?
BRYCE
They...  uh... 
(beat)
They tore my shirt. I really liked this shirt.
She embraces him. Gently.
98.
INT. A VAN (MOVING) - DAY
They’re on their way to the Hague. Amelia’s driving. Kiernan is riding shotgun and pounding coffee. Bryce is laid out in back, still recovering.
Kiernan flips on the RADIO and finds a classical station. A gesture for Bryce.
BRYCE
Oh, this is a great piece. It’s
Beethoven’s third symphony, the
maturation of his middle period.
It’s also known as the “Eroica”--
Kiernan turns around and stares hard at Bryce: don’t push it.
Bryce stops talking.
To Kiernan, quietly, so Bryce doesn’t hear:
AMELIA
Thank you.
INT. ICC - SIDE ROOM - DAY
Livitin and Demidov. Livitin closes his cell phone. Furious.
Wants to punch the wall.
LIVITIN
(He hasn’t gotten here yet. We
still have a chance to stop him.)
Demidov is calm. And still. A coiled serpent.
EXT. ROADSIDE - DAY
Bryce and Amelia standing outside the van. They’re on a hill overlooking a broad plain.
TITLE:
The Hague, Netherlands
The coastline is visible in the distance. The Hague is dominated by a huge building, angular and gleaming white:
The HAAGSE ARC.
This is the seat of the International Criminal Court.
99.
Blue-helmeted UNITED NATIONS TROOPS have established a security perimeter all around the Arc. Most of the surrounding roads have been closed down.
Everything looks quiet. Under control.
Bryce has cleaned up and changed into a fresh suit. He’s got a FOLDER full of blueprints and building diagrams -- advance work on the Arc. He watches the plain below with binoculars.
THROUGH THE BINOCULARS
Bryce observes several VEHICLES doing patrols just outside the security perimeter. They’re definitely not UN personnel -- KAJEKI COMMANDOS. Demidov’s final line of defense.
Bryce observes the pattern of the patrols -- in particular, a BLACK VAN with tinted windows.
Kiernan climbs out of the van. He’s sobered up. Surprisingly, he’s now wearing a sportcoat. It looks good -- but he hates it. He rips the coat off. Sticking with his usual look.
BRYCE
Let’s go to court.
Amelia dials a cell phone.
INT. HAAGSE ARC - HALLWAY - DAY
Casoria steps out of the trial chamber to answer his cell.
CASORIA
Casoria.
INTERCUT CASORIA & AMELIA
AMELIA
It’s Ryder. Call me back from a
landline. We need to discuss the
plans for my very large office.
Casoria breaks into a huge grin.
INT./EXT. KAJEKI VEHICLE/HAAGSE ARC - DAY
Two Kajeki COMMANDOS drive slowly down the street in front of the Arc’s main entrance.
On the adjoining streets, other Kajeki VEHICLES also circle the building. Including the BLACK VAN.
100.
They’re just waiting. Nothing yet.
INT. BACK OF A VAN (MOVING) - DAY
Amelia is on her cell.
AMELIA
We’re ready. Go.
INT./EXT. KAJEKI VEHICLE/HAAGSE ARC - DAY
Motion -- suddenly, UN TROOPS start massing in front of the main entrance. The Kajekis go on alert. The PASSENGER gets on the radio:
PASSENGER
(Watch the front.)
The other Kajeki vehicles begin moving to cut off access to the front. Including the BLACK VAN -- it starts coming around from the side --
--	but then a UN SUV pulls out in front of it, cutting it off. The black van has been made.
PASSENGER
(into radio)
(Careful. Not too close.)
POLICE CARS are converging on the black van now -- the other Kajekis have to back off.
INT./EXT. - BLACK VAN/HAAGSE ARC - DAY
The side door of the black van slides open -- Kiernan and Amelia are in back, along with two bound KAJEKI COMMANDOS. Bryce is behind the wheel. They pulled a switch.
AMELIA
(into cell)
Perfect. Thank you, sir.
The back door of the UN SUV opens -- Casoria is waiting inside.
Concealed by the stopped vehicles, Bryce, Kiernan, and Amelia slip out of the black van and climb into the SUV.
As the SUV pulls away, POLICE CARS surround the black van, now empty except for the bound Kajekis.
101.
The UN Troops -- decoys -- are still massed at the Arc’s front entrance.
INT. UN SUV (MOVING) - DAY
No one talks yet. The SUV pulls right up to the Arc’s side entrance, they all get out and rush inside --
INT. HAAGSE ARC - CORRIDOR - DAY
-- where four armed ICC GUARDS are waiting.
CASORIA
Sean Kiernan, welcome to the Hague.
BRYCE
Let’s keep moving.
GUARD
(to Kiernan)
We won’t cuff you just yet, but I
have to ask you to disarm.
BRYCE
Absolutely not. Not until we’re in the courtroom.
GUARD
We can’t let him roam the halls--
KIERNAN
It’s fine. I’ll disarm.
(re: Bryce)
If he can keep his weapons.
Casoria nods. Kiernan gives the Guards his guns and a large DUFFEL BAG holding more weapons -- keeping only the metal case with the certificates.
Bryce calls up a BUILDING MAP of the Arc on his phone. He scrolls to show the Guards a route through the building.
BRYCE
Gentlemen, this is the path we’ll
take to the courtroom. Two front,
two back. I’ll stay with the
principal.
(to Casoria and Amelia)
Meet you there.
The ICC Guards fall in under Bryce’s command. They move down the hall in formation -- Bryce is at maximum readiness.
102.
Bryce is taking them through the Arc’s
SERVICE CORRIDORS
They barrel down the halls, surprising the CUSTODIANS and MAINTENANCE STAFF as they pass. Kiernan lets Bryce go through doors first, stands where Bryce tells him -- Kiernan has become a model client. The trust is there now.
So far, no resistance. Now they move into --
INT. HAAGSE ARC - STAIRWELL - DAY
The Guards open the door. Bryce walks in, motions for everyone to hold. He scans the stairwell. Clear.
They escort Kiernan up one flight, then into another
CORRIDOR
The Guard indicates a door down the hall. Two more GUARDS standing outside it.
GUARD
Almost there.
Bryce stays on alert, expecting...  something. Now they’re a hundred feet away.
Eighty.
Sixty.
Forty.
The door Guards start to move --
-- Bryce’s hands go to his machinepistols --
-- twenty feet -- the Guards swing the door open -- -- Bryce motions everyone to hold. He walks into --
INT. TRIAL CHAMBER 1 - DAY
The courtroom is packed. The GALLERY, the JUDGES, both sets of ATTORNEYS...  everyone’s here. So is DEMIDOV, calmly studying his notes.
They’re all settling in, just back from a break. Bryce came in through a side door -- no one’s even noticed him yet.
103.
Bryce carefully surveys the scene. Everything is exactly as it should be.
They made it.
Bryce surrenders his own weapons to the Guards, who put them in a storage locker. They cuff Kiernan, then bring him in.
The courtroom goes still. Everyone turns. Demidov looks up.
He shows no reaction. Just stares.
Kiernan gives the metal case to Moreno at the prosecution table. Moreno opens it, flips through... 
... and leaps to his feet. He wants a sidebar. Now.
As the lawyers and judges confer, Kiernan is escorted to a chair behind the prosecution table.
Casoria and Amelia have come in as well. Casoria shakes Bryce’s hand.
CASORIA
Many thanks. Perhaps we will be able to work with you again in the future. We should discuss.
Bryce nods. Sure. Then he takes a seat next to Kiernan.
Neither man speaks for a moment. They can’t quite believe they’re really here. The effort of the last few days is suddenly catching up to them.
KIERNAN
Been meaning to tell you something.
BRYCE
What’s that?
KIERNAN
I’m sorry that I killed so many of your clients over the years.
BRYCE
Oh. Thank you.
(beat)
“So many”? You mean, a few.
KIERNAN
Mmm...  more than a few.
BRYCE
Well, that’s very kind. I’ve been meaning to tell you something, too.
104.
KIERNAN
What’s that?
BRYCE
You remember Atienza? The guy, I
switched vehicles on you... 
KIERNAN
... then I killed him on his yacht.
BRYCE
I also switched yachts.
KIERNAN
Really?
BRYCE
Yep. You blew up an empty boat.
KIERNAN
(beat)
You fucker.
Bryce starts to LAUGH. Kiernan does, too. It’s a combination of giddiness and deep exhaustion. They keep laughing --
--	people are starting to turn and look. They’re like two kids cracking up in class. They can’t help it.
Amelia turns and stares: what is wrong with you two? Finally, they settle down. Mostly.
The sidebar is over. Didn’t go well for Livitin. Back at the defense table, he makes a last-ditch effort:
LIVITIN
The defense objects to the
introduction of this--
Out of nowhere, Demidov slams the table, yells --
DEMIDOV
No! Enough.
Livitin knew this was coming. He’s done all he can do.
LIVITIN
My client wishes to briefly address the court.
Curious, the lead Judge nods. Demidov rises, satisfied to finally be taking center stage.
105.
DEMIDOV
I have spent months sitting in that chair, nodding along with this ludicrous charade. It is a waste of your time, and far more importantly, of mine. With apologies to my excellent attorney, the charges against me are entirely correct.
A BUZZ in the gallery -- what? He plows ahead:
DEMIDOV
I am the ruler of Kajekistan, a sovereign nation of this earth. As the ruler of my nation, I will do as I wish -- without exception, without apology. I recognize no authority that limits my power.
Bryce and Kiernan are as shocked as everyone else. Bryce is more than shocked -- he’s worried.
BRYCE
Did we get in here too easily?
Kiernan turns to him, confused, as Demidov continues:
DEMIDOV
In this trial, the world community is attempting to make a statement.
BRYCE
Demidov has massive resources. We just walked in. Where were the rest of his men?
DEMIDOV
But now I would like to make a
statement of my own.
KIERNAN
(gets it)
The UN team was focused on me.
They’re out of position --
Bryce and Kiernan get up, rushing towards Casoria --
DEMIDOV
I do not recognize the jurisdiction of this court... 
Livitin has been quietly packing up his briefcase. He nods to a KAJEKI in the gallery, who whispers into his cell --
106.
DEMIDOV
... so I will now take my leave.
With my dignity intact.
Demidov and Livitin brace themselves as -- -- we hear a MASSIVE EXPLOSION --
-- the BUILDING SHAKES -- everyone is thrown to the ground -- -- more EXPLOSIONS offscreen -- now SHOUTING, GUNFIRE -- -- total chaos --
-- Bryce and Kiernan trying to regain their feet --
-- the ICC Guards moving to secure Demidov -- but then --
-- a wave of KAJEKI COMMANDOS bursts into the courtroom -- wearing full tactical gear -- gasmasks --
-- FIRING on the Guards, throwing TEAR GAS GRENADES --
--	the Guards make the mistake of trying to fight through the gas -- they collapse, CHOKING --
--	Bryce and Kiernan know better, they run to the door they came in through, pulling Amelia with them --
--	the Commandos give masks to Demidov and Livitin, rushing them outside -- Kiernan and Bryce can only watch --
--	Alexander Demidov is busting out of the Hague.
INT. CORRIDOR - DAY
Bryce, Kiernan, and Amelia make it out of the courtroom -- fresh air --
AMELIA
How did they--?
BRYCE
The weapons at the warehouse.
KIERNAN
Demidov was never selling them.
This was his backup plan.
Kiernan has KEYS he pulled off a fallen Guard -- he unlocks his cuffs, then the door to the --
STORAGE LOCKER
107.
where all their WEAPONS are being kept.
As Kiernan and Bryce dig through their duffel bag, re-arming themselves, they can hear more GUNSHOTS and EXPLOSIONS. They’re both utterly spent. But it’s time for one last push.
Casoria staggers out of the courtroom. Bryce pulls two RADIOS off the door Guards. Gives one to Amelia.
BRYCE
Help him. He’s got to direct the UN force. We’re going after Demidov.
Kiernan and Bryce race down the corridor, around the corner to the
COURTROOM ENTRANCE
At the end of the hall --
--	a huge HOLE has been blown into the side of the building. SMOKE and DAYLIGHT. Demidov’s escape route.
There are KAJEKI COMMANDOS and UN TROOPS down the hallway, locked in combat. There’s no clear path for Bryce and Kiernan to follow Demidov --
Kiernan starts down another hall -- but Bryce pulls two GUNS, runs straight ahead -- FIRING right into the crowd --
-- BODIES start falling -- is Bryce killing the UN troops? --
--	no -- he has a MACHINEPISTOL in one hand, and his gun that fires RUBBER BULLETS in the other -- left hand lethal, right hand nonlethal --
--	killing the Commandos, knocking out the UN troops --
--	clearing the path. He and Kiernan tear down the hall, through the rubble, towards the gash of smoldering daylight --
EXT. HAAGSE ARC - DAY
The UN security perimeter has been utterly obliterated.
PATROL VEHICLES, smoking and charred, litter the road. The only troops in sight are corpses.
A MISSILE LAUNCHER, set up in the back of a truck, is still aimed at the building. SHOULDER-MOUNTED ASSAULT WEAPONS are scattered on the ground. The weapons we saw in the warehouse, now abandoned --
108.
-- as the Kajekis make their getaway.
They’re speeding away in two FAST-ATTACK VEHICLES. Bryce and Kiernan are on foot. No way to catch up.
Kiernan limping behind him, Bryce races up a low hill to an
OVERPASS
Now he can see the final piece of Demidov’s escape plan:
A small PLANE waiting in the distance. The fast-attack vehicles are closing on it. Bryce gets on the radio:
BRYCE
(into radio)
Tell Casoria they’re flying out
from the west. And I need you to
get back in that storage locker.
EXT. AT THE PLANE - DAY
The fast-attack vehicles screech to a stop. Demidov, Livitin, and the Commandos hustle to get onboard. The PILOT waits in the hatchway -- he greets Demidov with a formal salute.
Demidov returns the salute. He’s back in command.
EXT. OVERPASS - DAY
Kiernan and Bryce watch the plane begin a slow taxi down a blocked-off road. It’s heading towards the coastline and --
-- the endless expanse of the NORTH SEA.
Bryce scans the horizon -- more UN and POLICE VEHICLES are coming from the east, but they’re still far away. Demidov will be in the air before they can get to him.
The plane is still taxiing -- it has to make a few turns before it can reach the final straightaway.
BRYCE
Can you make a shot from here?
KIERNAN
With what?
Amelia is running up the hill towards them -- carrying Bryce’s SNIPER RIFLE.
109.
KIERNAN
Absolutely.
Bryce FIRES into the guardrail, shredding the metal to create a gap -- a perfect sniper position for Kiernan.
Amelia gets to them. She also brought a MED KIT. Kiernan takes the rifle, starts assembling it.
This is the only elevated spot around -- and they’ve been spotted. Surviving Kajeki COMMANDOS are racing towards them. Coming in from all sides.
KIERNAN
As soon as they turn onto the
straightaway, I’ll have a shot at
the pilot.
As Kiernan sets up his position, Bryce turns to Amelia.
BRYCE
Get out of here.
She looks around at the incoming Commandos. Doesn’t want to leave Bryce alone.
BRYCE
I need to protect him. I can’t do that unless I know you’re safe. Go.
No time to argue. No goodbye kiss. She turns and runs back down the hill. Gets on the radio --
INT. UN VEHICLE (MOVING) - DAY
Casoria is riding with the UN TROOPS, racing towards Demidov’s plane.
AMELIA (ON RADIO)
Kiernan’s in position.
Casoria can see Bryce and Kiernan on the overpass. The plane taxiing in the distance. The bullet will have to travel more than a mile. A hell of a shot.
Casoria starts to respond to Amelia -- but there’s nothing to say. Nothing to do but watch and hope.
EXT. OVERPASS - DAY
Kiernan and Bryce are alone. But not for much longer. The Commandos are closing in from all sides.
110.
Bryce pulls ammo clips from his pockets. Hooks them on his belt. Kiernan sets the rifle in place. Chambers a round. He lies on the ground -- sniper’s crouch. Bryce stands over him.
BRYCE
I have you covered. Don’t think
about anything except the shot.
Kiernan sights the plane. Zeroes out the scope. He picks a spot farther down the plane’s path -- at the last turn, where he’ll have a clear shot at the pilot.
THE COMMANDOS
are closing in.
AMELIA
is at the bottom of the hill. Watching. Trying not to watch.
ON THE OVERPASS
Bryce draws his machinepistols. Shakes his hands out. Getting loose.
Kiernan lying on the ground. Bryce standing over him. The hitman and his bodyguard.
The Commandos --
-- are now in range --
-- Bryce opens FIRE.
He STRAFES the Commandos. His SHELL CASINGS clatter on the pavement. They return FIRE, but he’s too fast -- won’t give them an opening.
Kiernan glances up, checking to be sure he’s safe -- Bryce screams down at him:
BRYCE
I’ve got you. Make the shot.
Bryce continues laying down 360-degree cover fire --
We’re with Kiernan. He puts his eye to the rifle scope. He breathes.
And...  EVERYTHING GETS SLOW.
Kiernan’s tuned out the rest of the world.
There’s nothing but the plane. The rifle scope. The trigger.
111.
Bryce’s shell casings falling like leaves all around him.
The plane is turning. Almost in the kill zone.
Kiernan takes a deep breath. Holds it.
He listens to his heartbeat. Waiting for a moment between beats, to achieve perfect stillness.
The plane comes out of the turn --
--	the PILOT is in his cross hairs. Kiernan squeezes the trigger.
A soft POP -- a gentle nudge of recoil --
--	and --
--	the cockpit window SHATTERS --
--	a fine RED SPRAY blooms from the head of the Pilot --
--	Kiernan lifts his head -- triumphant --
--	as a shadow passes over him --
--	Bryce, falling to the ground.
His shirt is red with BLOOD.
The world rushes back in on Kiernan -- FAST again --
Bryce’s body hits the ground -- Kiernan rolls -- two more Commandos coming, the last two, Bryce took out the rest --
-- as Kiernan scrambles to grab a machinepistol --
--	both Commandos fall -- Amelia is running up the hill, emptying her SIDEARM -- she’s killed the Commandos --
--	it’s just Kiernan and Bryce. SIRENS fill the air.
Kiernan tears away Bryce’s shirt. A round went through the gap in his bulletproof vest.
Bryce is distant, glassy. Fading.
Focused on Bryce, Kiernan doesn’t even notice, off in the distance --
112.
THE PLANE
now without a pilot, drifting off to the side, slowing...  the wave of UN VEHICLES is closing in on it... 
ON THE OVERPASS
Kiernan dives for the med kit Amelia brought. Finds packets of CELOX blood clotter -- what they used to patch up Taras.
Kiernan dumps the Celox powder into Bryce’s wound, packing it in, just the way Bryce showed him --
-- SIRENS all around now --
-- Kiernan balls up Bryce’s shirt, a pressure bandage --
--	Kiernan isn’t aware of the AMBULANCE or the TWO MEDICS until they’re trying to pull him away from Bryce --
--	Kiernan shakes them off. He’s not leaving Bryce. He holds the pressure bandage in place as the Medics start CPR.
Amelia is trying to get to them -- the POLICE won’t let her through --
Kiernan and the Medics work in silence.
Bryce COUGHS. He takes a breath. Another. And another.
One of the Medics gently pulls Kiernan’s hands away. He applies a clean bandage to the wound. Puts an oxygen mask over Bryce’s mouth.
MEDIC
He’s stable.
The Medics wheel out a stretcher to load Bryce into the ambulance.
Bryce’s eyes are refocusing. He looks at Kiernan. A question. Kiernan looks up at --
THE PLANE
Demidov’s Commandos are getting down on the ground, complying with the UN TROOPS surrounding them.
Demidov is also on the ground, hands cuffed behind his back.
Casoria stands over him.
113.
ON THE OVERPASS
Kiernan nods.
KIERNAN
They got him. We did it.
(beat)
Technically, I did it.
Bryce grins under the mask. Gives Kiernan the finger as he’s loaded onto the stretcher.
Kiernan watches him get put into the
AMBULANCE
Amelia has gotten past the police. She runs to Bryce.
Bryce pulls off his oxygen mask. The Medic is about to hook him up to an IV, but Bryce waves him away.
BRYCE
Not yet. I need a clear head.
Amelia takes Bryce’s hand. He’s weak, but he needs to say this now:
BRYCE
You asked me to wait until this was over. It’s over. And I know exactly what I’m feeling.
(beat)
Amelia...  I love you.
(beat)
That was really average. I’m sorry. Can I try again later, when I haven’t just been shot?
AMELIA
That was perfect. I love you, too,
Michael.
BRYCE
Okay. Good. That’s good.
(to the Medic)
And now I would like you to inject me with every painkiller you have.
The Medic puts the oxygen mask back over Bryce’s face. Starts up the IV.
Amelia lays a kiss on Bryce’s mask. She holds his hand as he drifts away.
114.
KIERNAN
kept his distance, but he watched all of that. Now there’s a
VOICE from behind him:
GUARD
Get down on the ground.
It’s two of the ICC GUARDS who escorted him to the courtroom earlier. Kiernan complies. They cuff him.
From the ground, Kiernan watches the ambulance take Bryce and Amelia away.
FADE TO BLACK.
FADE IN:
INT. HAAGSE ARC - TRIAL CHAMBER 1 - DAY
Demidov’s sentencing. Security is beyond airtight.
The CLERK reads out the sentence:
CLERK
... Alexander Ilyich Demidov, for your crimes, you are hereby sentenced to serve the remainder of your natural life as a prisoner under the jurisdiction of the Criminal Court... 
Bryce stands in the back of the gallery. He doesn’t look fully recovered yet, but he’s getting there.
As the sentence is read out, Bryce slips into the
HALLWAY
The damage from the attack has been mostly patched up. Bryce walks down the hall and into --
INT. TRIAL CHAMBER 2 - DAY
A much smaller courtroom. A single JUDGE presiding. Two defendants stand before him: Janet and Sean Kiernan. Kiernan is in leg irons, and his hands are cuffed at his waist.
Bryce takes a seat in the empty gallery.
115.
JUDGE
Janet Kiernan, under the plea
bargain as so described, you are
free to go.
(beat)
Sean Kiernan. This court has received several pleas for leniency on your behalf -- from the ICC prosecutors, the leadership of Interpol, as well as your ex-wife.
Kiernan steals a look at Janet. He wasn’t expecting that. The Judge continues:
JUDGE
However, the court finds that your recent actions cannot outweigh your past crimes. You are hereby sentenced to serve the remainder of your natural life as a prisoner under the jurisdiction of the Criminal Court. We are adjourned.
Kiernan and Bryce knew this was coming. Neither man shows any reaction. As the GUARDS start to escort Kiernan away -- Janet goes to him.
KIERNAN
You see? I only ruined your life
the one time.
She hugs him. A kiss on the cheek.
JANET
Ah, Sean. You never did.
As the Guards lead Kiernan away, his eyes meet Bryce’s. A moment between them. A look, a nod, and goodbye.
Bryce walks back into the
HALLWAY
Casoria sits on a bench, waiting for Bryce. He motions him to sit. Hands him some papers.
CASORIA
We have met your terms.
INT. PRISON TRANSPORT (MOVING) - DAY
Kiernan rides alone in back. Expressionless.
116.
The transport rumbles to a stop. The back doors are thrown open. The GUARDS motion Kiernan to get out --
EXT. ROADSIDE - DAY
The middle of nowhere. The deserted parking lot of a small DIVE BAR. Kiernan has no idea what’s going on.
As the Guards lead Kiernan to the door, we might notice Bryce’s Jag parked off to the side.
INT. DIVE BAR - DAY
The place is empty except for a few INTERPOL GUARDS -- and Bryce and Casoria. They sit at a table with a bottle of whiskey and three glasses.
The Guards lead Kiernan to a chair. Bryce has a poker face.
Casoria gets right to it:
CASORIA
Interpol was first chartered to coordinate between law-enforcement arms of various nations. But we’ve found that by the time we get the FBI, SIS, FSB, so on to even sit at the same table, the criminals are already enjoying their retirement.
(beat)
Interpol needs to do more than coordinate. We need to be able to act. I have been authorized to create Interpol’s first ever clandestine division. I have asked Mr. Bryce to consider joining.
(beat)
He agreed, on one condition: he would join if and only if you were brought on as his partner.
Bryce nods. Kiernan can’t believe it. Casoria continues:
CASORIA
My initial reaction was extremely negative. But Mr. Bryce and Agent Ryder finally brought me around. I am now inviting the two of you to be the founding and sole members of Interpol’s clandestine division.
Kiernan, still stunned, doesn’t say anything just yet.
Casoria is happy to continue:
117.
CASORIA
Mr. Kiernan, you will need to keep a low profile, to maintain the illusion that you are in prison. Shouldn’t be difficult for you. But we will insist that you not return to your prior line of work.
(turning to Bryce)
You are free to continue in your executive-protection business, with the understanding that from time to time, we will call on you.
(beat)
It being a clandestine division,
that’s all I can tell you unless
you agree to join.
Bryce and Kiernan exchange a look. No discussion required.
They’re in.
A Guard unlocks Kiernan’s cuffs while Casoria pours drinks.
They make a silent toast.
CASORIA
We’ll be in touch soon. For now,
you have both earned a vacation.
Gentlemen.
They rise to shake hands, then Casoria and the Guards disappear out the door. Now it’s just Bryce and Kiernan in the empty bar.
KIERNAN
I don’t know what to say.
BRYCE
I couldn’t let you do that time.
And strange as it is -- we make a
pretty good team.
KIERNAN
We do, don’t we?
And with that --
-- Kiernan punches Bryce in the face.
Bryce goes down. He truly did not see that coming.
KIERNAN
Even! Now we can move on.
Bryce lies there, dazed. Then he starts laughing. Kiernan helps him back up.
118.
KIERNAN
Right, let’s have another.
Back to the table. Kiernan pours a fresh round of shots.
BRYCE
To a long life.
KIERNAN
To a long life.
They drink -- Bryce slams his empty glass down on the table before Kiernan does. A challenge.
KIERNAN
Sure you want to drink against me,
Michael? That’s a dangerous road.
BRYCE
Pour.
Kiernan pours. They drink and slam their glasses down -- at the exact same moment. It’s on.
As Kiernan pours another round --
KIERNAN
Hang on. Who’s driving?
BRYCE
Screw it. We’ll call a cab.
They drink, slam their glasses down --
THE END
