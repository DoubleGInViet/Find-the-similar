AND FADING UP FROM THAT BLACK TO:

A BLACK AND WHITE FILM.	SILENT.

A PIANO. It starts playing by itself. And now we’re MOVING over MEN IN TUXEDOS and WOMEN IN GOWNS until we find --

A STAGE. On that stage, there are three men with sheets over their heads. GHOSTS. Each holds an umbrella. A man in a SKELETON COSTUME rushes the stage. And now --

SKELETON and GHOSTS rush into the audience. The Women are SCREAMING now... or LAUGHING? All of this is creepy and weird and foreign and most of all?

Deeply fucking PRETENTIOUS.

It is Renoir’s classic, RULES OF THE GAME.

If you don’t know that, congratulations, you’re not an elitist dipshit who spent way too much money on film school.

A female VOICE --

FLIGHT ATTENDANT (O.S.)
Can I get you a snack?

TILT OFF THE FILM, playing on the screen of an iPAD to FIND --

A bright-eyed FLIGHT ATTENDANT.	So...


INT. MAIN CABIN - PRIVATE JET - IN FLIGHT - NIGHT

... We’re on a PLANE. A HIGHLY EXTRAVAGANT ONE. Cabin lights are dimmed... several SLEEPING FORMS in fully reclined seats as The Attendant’s smile focuses on --

RICHARD.

A middle-aged man in trendy glasses and a scarf he doesn’t need. He slips off his super-trendy-top-of-the-line-wireless HEADPHONES, annoyed --

RICHARD
... What?

FLIGHT ATTENDANT
... I’m sorry, sir... I didn’t mean to interrupt, I just --

RICHARD
-- But you did.	Interrupt.
 
5.


What a dick.	The flight attendant smiles back.	A pro --

FLIGHT ATTENDANT
Sorry, sir...	I just wanted to see
if you’d like a snack.

RICHARD
What’ve you got?

FLIGHT ATTENDANT
Actually, we have some fantastic

caviar.	It’s Ossetra, fresh fr--

RICHARD
-- Nah.

FLIGHT ATTENDANT
All right... I could make you a
sandwich -- We’ve got fresh deli
and a variety of cheeses... There’s

a kale lasagna I could heat up f--

RICHARD
-- Is it vegan?

FLIGHT ATTENDANT
(uh...)

It’s a kale lasagna.

RICHARD
Is the pasta made from eggs?

FLIGHT ATTENDANT
... I’m not sure --

RICHARD
-- I’ll just have some champagne.

FLIGHT ATTENDANT
Of course, sir.

She smiles (forcefully), moves off down the aisle.

Richard checks out her ass as she opens a small fridge in the GALLEY, plucks out a champagne flute --

RICHARD
Is that the Heidsieck?

FLIGHT ATTENDANT
... Sorry?
 
6.


RICHARD
German sub sank a ship on the way to Tsar Nicholas II... couple years back they found the wreck and a case of the 1907 Heidsieck. They sent a little robot down to bring it back up -- Athena bought three bottles at 50K per... she said she was bringing one with.

Oh fucking brother. The Flight Attendant tries not to roll her eyes. She smiles --

FLIGHT ATTENDANT
This’s just plain old Dom Perignon.

She expertly POPS the cork, wraps a cloth napkin around the neck of the bottle as she moves back towards Richard --

RICHARD
Guess that’ll have to do.

Dick. She puts the flute down on the table before him. This is a BIG plane. Like Air Force One. She starts to pour --

RICHARD (CONT’D)
You like working for Athena?

FLIGHT ATTENDANT
(a beat; lies)

Yes.	She’s sweet.

RICHARD
“Sweet?”	Don’t let her hear you
say th--	WHOA -- JESUS!!!

-- The champagne SPILLS OVER the full flute, onto his lap --

RICHARD (CONT’D)
... What the fuck?!?

--	But The Attendant is frozen in SHOCK and confusion, looking past Richard at --

A MAN.	TWENTIES.	Head to toe in DENIM.

He has just emerged through a curtain towards the back of the plane -- a long strand of DROOL dripping from his mouth as he stumbles forward into the main cabin, SLURRING --

DENIM
Whazzzzzzzzzzzzzz?

Chaos ensues.
 
7.


Richard hops to his feet, knocking over the full glass --

RICHARD
SHIT!!!!

--	The SLEEPING BODIES start to stir -- A MIDDLE-AGED MAN whom we will call THE DOCTOR slips off his eye mask --

THE DOCTOR
... What’s going o--?

RICHARD
--	ONE OF THEM‘S FUCKING AWAKE!

--	“One of them?” That must be DENIM, whom Richard points to animatedly, PANICKED -- Denim blinks repeatedly, staggers further into the cabin --

DENIM
... Whazzzzzzzappen?

--	The Doctor is wide awake now, on his feet, grace under pressure, pushes past The Flight Attendant --

THE DOCTOR
Get some towels.

--	The Flight Attendant snaps out of it, heads off to do just that -- OTHER PEOPLE stirring awake now, but can’t make them out in the dark. One is a WOMAN in pajamas --

WOMAN
Jesus...

THE DOCTOR
Calm down.	Everything’s fine.

He’s preternaturally COOL as he reaches Denim, puts his arm around the man’s shoulder as he guides him towards a seat --

THE DOCTOR (CONT’D)
It’s all right... You’re okay. I’m a doctor. What’s your name?

Denim’s eyes try to focus -- He’s VERY fucking confused -- Still can’t quite make his mouth work --

DENIM
... Rahhhhhhhh...

The Doctor turns to the (totally terrified) Flight Attendant who has just returned with the towels --
 
8.


THE DOCTOR
Fantastic.	If you can just lay
them down on the floor right there.
(turns to Richard)

What’s his name?

RICHARD
Uh... Boxer, I think?

THE DOCTOR
His real name.

RICHARD
I don’t kn--

DENIM
-- Rannnndeeee?

THE DOCTOR
... Randy? Great -- Randy, you’re okay. I just need you to lie down on these towels here so I can put you back to sleep.

What. The. FUCK? The Doctor guides Denim (now RANDY) towards the towels, now spread across the floor --

RANDY
... Wh...Why?

THE DOCTOR
Because you woke up before you were supposed to.

What? Woke up... before he was SUPPOSED TO? The Doctor turns to the Flight Attendant --

THE DOCTOR (CONT’D)
May I have your pen?

He’s pointing to the one clipped to her little apron. She nods -- Hands it to the Doctor...

DOCTOR
Thanks.

--	The Doctor clicks the end of the pen, and then, without hesitation nor fanfare --

Jams it into Randy’s NECK!

RICHARD
JESUS CHRIST!!
 
9.


The Flight Attendant SHRIEKS --AN ARTERIAL SPRAY OF BLOOD SPLASHES ONTO THE TOWELS -- RANDY GURGLES as the Doctor, cool as a cucumber, turns to Richard --

DOCTOR
Gimme a hand?

RICHARD
FUCK, TED!!!!

DOCTOR
Give me a hand.

Randy’s eyes blink rapidly -- Blood -- LOTS of fucking BLOOD turning his white t-shirt DARK RED -- Richard , FREAKING OUT, takes a knee, helps The Doctor lay Randy down on the towels --

RICHARD
... Why’d you do that, man?!?

DOCTOR
He woke up.

Randy looks up at The Doctor, CONFUSED, life draining --

RANDY
... Graahhhhhhhhgle?

RICHARD
FUCK -- It hasn’t started yet!!!!

Wait. What’s “it?” And WHY hasn’t it “started?” Randy’s eyes blink, confusion -- and then? SURVIVAL. It happens FAST -- He reaches out, grabs the CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE --

--	SMASHES IT INTO THE SIDE OF RICHARD’S FACE. The Flight Attendant SHRIEKS. Richard stumbles back --

RICHARD (CONT’D)
MOTHERFUCK!!!

--	Randy is ADRENALIZED -- ON HIS FEET -- HAND OVER HIS NECK,
FIGHTING FOR HIS LIFE -- BRANDISHING THE BROKEN NECK OF THE BOTTLE -- THE DOCTOR DODGES -- TOO SLOW -- RANDY STABS HIM IN THE SHOULDER -- IT’S A SHIT SHOW -- THE OTHER PASSENGERS SHOUT IN ALARM, BUT DO NOTHING TO HELP AS WE SMASH TO:


INT. A DARKENED PRIVATE BEDROOM - JET - CONTINUOUS

--	MUFFLED SHOUTS of the melee -- We’re clearly CLOSE BY. DARK IN HERE -- but enough light to see a BED and a WOMAN laying down upon it.
 
10.


She sits up, awakened by the BATTLE. Slides off her EYEMASK. We stay BEHIND HER. Throughout what’s to come, we never see her face... It will be a LONG time before we do.

The Woman cocks her head, listens to the RAGING BATTLE just beyond the door behind her for a moment. And then...

Calmly reaches to the side of the bed and picks up one of her HIGH-HEELED SHOES. She RISES. And now we’re MOVING BEHIND HER as she OPENS THE DOOR and we’re --


INT. MAIN CABIN - PRIVATE JET - IN FLIGHT - NIGHT

-- Back in the MAIN CABIN -- DOWN AT THE END OF THE AISLE -- RANDY fighting for his life, SWINGING THE BROKEN BOTTLE -- THE DOCTOR AND RICHARD both WOUNDED -- SHOUTING, TRYING TO KEEP HIM AT BAY --

RICHARD	DOCTOR	
JESUS FUCK--!!!	-- GRAB HIM!	
		
--	YOU FUCKING GRAB HIM!

--	MOVING BEHIND THE WOMAN, striding towards them, fearless, her shoe clutched in her right hand, Randy’s back to her as he LUNGES to STAB THE DOCTOR AGAIN -- And she calmly says --

THE WOMAN
Hey.

Randy instinctively turns towards her, one moment to register SURPRISE before --

--	She jams her stiletto heel right into his fucking eye.

THWUUUUUUD.	Randy falls back, hits the floor.

The shoe is literally STUCK to his face.

His mouth opens and closes like a fish out of the tank. Blood leaks from the wound in his neck, life literally pouring out of him. And it’s clear --

He is done fighting now. And we STAY HERE with him, never leaving his face as the cabin goes QUIET. Just the ragged breath of the wounded passengers standing above him. Finally, a single, reverent word --

THE DOCTOR (O.S.)
... Athena.

For that is The Woman’s name. ATHENA. Still unseen. But we HEAR her voice, eerily calm --
 
11.


ATHENA (O.S.)
Put him back with the others.

Her hand reaches into frame -- SKLISSSSSSSH! -- Slowly pulls the stiletto heel out of Randy’s face. HIS EYE, impaled on the bottom, the OPTIC NERVE CORD still attached until her fingers reach in, gently pinch it, freeing her shoe.

We never leave Randy’s face, gasping his final breaths. Now, another voice. Richard’s --

RICHARD (O.S.)
... But it’s not fair. He doesn’t know -- It hasn’t started yet.

We hear a soft, resigned SIGH.	Then --

ATHENA
No sentimentality, comrade.

War is war.

Now, a pair of hands, the Doctor’s, reach down and grabs Randy by the arms -- PULLING HIM down the aisle.

HOLDING ON RANDY, the blood no longer pouring from his wounds as his heart gives out -- Heading BACK through the CURTAIN he initially staggered through and into --


INT. THE HOLD - PRIVATE PLANE - CONTINUOUS

--	THE HOLD. The Doctor drags Randy to a spot, then drops his arms. Mutters under his breath as he EXITS --

THE DOCTOR (O.S.)
Fucking redneck.

CLOSE ON RANDY’S ONE-EYED FACE. It’s almost over now. His final rasping breaths. All alone. He’s gonna die all alone.

But wait. He turns his head with his remaining strength. And there, right next to him --

Is a YOUNG WOMAN. She’s out cold. Randy opens his mouth, manages one final whisper --

RANDY
H.... Hel....	Help....

And that’s it.	He’s done.	He’s DEAD.

And so, his journey complete, we FINALLY LEAVE him, drifting off Randy’s face on and onto hers. This SLEEPING BEAUTY. Closer and closer and CLOSER until --
 
12.


EXT. WOODS - SOMEWHERE - DAY

--	SHE SITS UP SUDDENLY!!!!!

HARSH LIGHT OF DAY. Her eyes blink in fear and CONFUSION. We see now she’s wearing a TANK TOP and cutoff denim shorts, colloquially known as DAISY DUKES. For now, that’s what we’ll call her.

DAISY.

And she will be our hero.

She blinks, getting her bearings. Sits up. She’s in an elevated, flat, less-woodsy patch of WOODS. Maybe that’s called a CLEARING. Point is, it’s remote. Oh. And here’s something else worth noting as Daisy touches her face --

-- She’s GAGGED.

Her panicked fingers maneuver over the THICK LEATHER STRAP covering her mouth, bound around the back of her head with a metal clasp... held closed by a small dangling PADLOCK.

Jesus.	Christ.

WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON RIGHT NOW. It’s disorienting. SCARY. Now we know how Daisy feels. A SOUND A FEW YARDS AWAY, drawing her attention to --

A WOMAN. Maybe Forty. Late. ALSO GAGGED. She’s crouched down, looking at something on the ground.

Daisy stands up -- Wobbly -- Was she drugged? -- Moves towards the woman, who we now see is wearing a NATIONAL RENTAL CAR SHIRT with a NAME-TAG on it.

It says “CRYSTAL.”

DAISY
Mmmmm!	Mmmm-mm-mmmmm!

Crystal glances up at Daisy and her muffled attempts to speak, but pays her no mind. Calmly puts her focus back down on what she’s doing --

Floating a DRIED LEAF in a shallow PUDDLE OF WATER.

Daisy furrows her brow as Crystal removes her name tag, SNAPS OFF the FASTENING PIN on the back -- Rubs the pin furiously against her HAIR. Then, carefully, she places the pin on the leaf. After a second --

The leaf STARTS TO TURN.	Because it’s not a leaf anymore...
 
13.


... It’s a backwoods COMPASS.

DAISY (CONT’D)
Mmmm!!	MMMM-MM-MM-MMM!!!

Crystal ignores her as she rises, holds her hand up to block the sun as she checks its position --

And WALKS OFF.

Daisy isn’t sure what to do. Or where she is. Or how she got here. Part of her wants to follow this woman, But it didn’t look like she wanted a fucking travel companion. MORE SOUNDS, bringing our attention --

ACROSS THE CLEARING

There are OTHERS stirring... sitting up -- ALL OF THEM (maybe TEN?) ARE GAGGED -- A FEW are moving towards the center of the clearing, where we notice for the first time --

There is a LARGE WOODEN CRATE. Roughly the size of an INDUSTRIAL REFRIGERATOR.

Daisy moves towards it, brow furrowed, looking at the faces of the other people WAKING UP around her and clearly not recognizing any of them. And now she’s reached --

--	THE CRATE.  There’s WRITING on the side in the same,
stenciled block letters that would traditionally say “THIS END UP.” This, however, is non-traditional. It says --

“FOUR LEGS GOOD.  TWO LEGS BAD.”

There’s a CROWBAR leaning against its side. Inviting someone to open it. A mid-thirties guy in a BUDWEISER SHIRT picks the crowbar up. But before he can use it, a fiftiesh DUDE IN A COWBOY SHIRT grabs Budweiser’s wrist, shakes his head --

COWBOY SHIRT
MmmmphRAP.

--	Cowboy Shirt’s got a GAG on like everybody else. But the translation is obvious. “TRAP.” Budweiser disagrees, pulls away. Angles the crowbar into the lid --

--	Fuck this. Cowboy Shirt RUNS FOR COVER, as does Daisy -- WE STAY WITH HER as she ducks behind a TREE.

TWENTY YARDS AWAY --

--	Budweiser works the crowbar -- PUSHES DOWN -- A CRACK OF WOOD AND NAILS as he POPS THE LID AND...
 
14.


... Nothing happens.

A BEAT as Daisy peeks out from behind the tree --

--	His back to us, Budweiser PUSHES THE LID OFF, looks down into the crate to examine its contents --

A HIGH PITCHED SQUEAL!!! Budweiser staggers back -- TRIPS -- As something LEAPS from the open crate --

It’s a fucking PIG.

Not a big one... the size of a small dog, like the one Clooney had as a pet... IT SQUEALS as it jets for safety, running right past Daisy, who furrows her brow -- What. The. Fuck. And now --

BUDWEISER (O.S.)
HFFFFEEYMMM!

--	Back to Budweiser, who is reaching into the crate and pulling something out. Well, hot damn. It’s an ASSAULT RIFLE. Budweiser handles it easily, comfortable with it.

Cowboy Shirt emerges from behind his tree, Daisy (hesitantly) does the same, heading over to the crate and getting a look for themselves at what’s inside --

WEAPONS. Lots of ‘em. RIFLES, PISTOLS, and KNIVES. And SURVIVAL GEAR. CANNED FOOD, a FIRST AID KIT, JUGS OF WATER.

Cowboy Shirt doesn’t hesitate -- reaches in and grabs himself a PISTOL -- a SOUND behind them -- Cowboy and Budweiser turn, leveling their GUNS at --

--	SEVEN MORE PEOPLE. Emerging from the woods -- All disoriented. Men and women, a variety of ages and sizes, all wearing GAGS WITH LOCKS. No time to introduce them one by one as they’ve gotten a glance at what’s in the CRATE and --

--	It’s a fucking FREE-FOR-ALL. They’re all just grabbing stuff like it’s Walmart on Black Friday -- Some go for the guns, others the jugs, twisting off the caps and pouring WATER over the leather straps covering their mouths, slurping up whatever makes it through.

Daisy is still cautious, unsure what to make of all this... and that’s precisely when she looks down at the discarded LID OF THE CRATE and spots something TAPED TO IT --

It looks like a small KEY. She kneels down, plucks the key from the tape. Smart enough to figure out what it’s for --
 
15.


--	SNAPS her fingers a the nearest person -- a younger guy in a TRUCKER HAT. She holds up the KEY, gesturing for him to come closer. He does. She slides the key into the small padlock dangling from his gag --

--	KLK. IT POPS OPEN. Daisy takes his gag off. Trucker coughs. Then inhales a big lungful of air.

TRUCKER HAT
... Thanks.

Daisy snaps, pointing to her gag. He takes the key and unlocks it for her -- SHOUTS TO THE OTHERS --

TRUCKER HAT (CONT’D)
WE GOTTA KEY!

Several of them move towards him, eager to be freed as Trucker Hat unlocks Cowboy Shirt’s gag --

DAISY
... What’s happening? What... is this?

TRUCKER HAT
Fuck if I know.

Cowboy pulls off his gag, reaches into the crate, pulls out a PISTOL, offers it to Daisy --

DAISY
... I don’t think I can use that.

Cowboy frowns, holds up his index finger, wiggles it as if to say “come over here.”

COWBOY SHIRT
Can you do this?

DAISY
... Yeah?

COWBOY SHIRT
Then you can squeeze a trigger.

Take it.

Daisy is clearly uncomfortable, but take it she does. Feels the weight of the weapon in her hand. Trucker Hat points --

TRUCKER HAT
That there’s the safety. Give her a flick, you’re ready to party.
 
16.


Daisy furrows her brow, fumbles a bit with shaky fingers, but manages to do as she’s told -- FLK. She offers a nervous smile to Trucker (he’s kinda cute, actually) --

DAISY
Thanks.

Trucker nods, a small grin (cause he knows he’s kinda cute) --

TRUCKER HAT
Welcome.

Krak.

In the distance. Dry. Like a branch. Daisy turns her heads towards the sound --

DAISY
... What was that?

COWBOY SHIRT
(worried)

Sounded like a ri--

--TUNK! A piece of bark FLIES off the tree right next to them. She’s confused. He isn’t. Then, another Krak.

COWBOY SHIRT (CONT’D)
GIDDOWN!!!

DAISY
... What?	What’s happ--?

--	HER FACE VAPORIZES.

PIECES OF HER SKULL AND BRAIN splatter all over TRUCKER --

TRUCKER HAT
... JESUS!!!

-- COWBOY is diving behind a tree, SHOUTING --

COWBOY SHIRT
GET THE FUCK DOWN!!!!

Everyone SCATTERS from the crate as Daisy’s lifeless body goes weak at the knees, collapses in a heap.

So she will not be our hero.

No, that distinction would fall on --

TRUCKER -- Krak! -- Who dives into the dirt as SHARDS OF CRATE explode behind him, detonated by another unseen bullet!
 
17.


--	HE SCRAMBLES -- HUNKERS DOWN on the opposite side of the crate -- There’s a red-headed woman, thirties, a little heavy, her face covered in FRECKLES here too, GUN HELD TIGHTLY IN HER HAND -- She’s INTENSE --

FRECKLES
Over there --

She nods -- Trucker looks, sees -- A HUNDRED YARDS OFF --

A GLINT OF SUNLIGHT OFF A SCOPE -- TWO QUICK MUZZLE FLASHES --

KRAKKRAK! The OTHERS around them, scattering for COVER, Trucker BRAVELY points out the SNIPER --

TRUCKER HAT
THERE!	HE’S FUCKING OVER TH--

Half his hand disappears in a PUFF OF RED VISCERA.

Trucker pulls what’s left of his palm back -- Blinks in SHOCK at his sudden reduction of fingers --

TRUCKER HAT (CONT’D)
... Aw shit.

KRAK!	Freckles isn’t waiting around -- SHOUTS --

FRECKLES
MOVE!

--	And move she fucking DOES -- Breaks cover from the CRATE as another shot HITS IT -- SPLINTERS OF WOOD -- Trucker looks up from his mangled hand as --

--	SHE RUNS -- Heading for the cover of a FALLEN TREE in the distance -- But right before she gets to it --

--	She DROPS OUT OF EXISTENCE. Literally FALLS INTO THE FUCKING GROUND.

Trucker blinks. KRAK!	What the hell?	Then hears --

FRECKLES (O.S.) (CONT’D)
HELP!!!!

-- ANOTHER PIECE OF CRATE EXPLODES --

--	And Trucker, because he IS our hero, leaps up and RUNS towards Freckles’ cries for HELP -- KRAK!

--	MOVING WITH HIM FAST AND FURIOUS until he reaches the spot where she disappeared from view --
 
18.


--	A HOLE.  A trench.  A trap.  FOUR FEET DEEP.  Littered
with the LEAVES that were previously HIDING IT from view. A row of SHARPENED WOODEN SPIKES in its floor, one of which --

--	Has IMPALED Freckles. A spike juts from the right side of her abdomen. Lots of BLOOD. She looks up at Trucker, scared and confused --

FRECKLES (CONT’D)
... I fell.

--	KRAK! Trucker falls to his belly beside the trench, extends his non-decimated hand to help her --

TRUCKER HAT
C’MON!

FRECKLES
... It’s my birthday tomorrow.

TRUCKER HAT
-- What!??

FRECKLES
I’m gonna eat a whole pie.

He shakes his head -- Jesus, she’s in SHOCK -- KRAK! -- He reaches down further -- Within REACH --

TRUCKER HAT
Goddammit TAKE MY HAND!

She coughs up blood... furrows her brow... extends her hand -- And Trucker GRABS it as DIRT kicks up in the ground a foot away from him. He doesn’t hesitate -- PULLS --

--	SSSSHLKISH! The Woman SHOUTS IN EXCRUCIATING PAIN as Trucker yanks her up and out, SLIDING her off the sharp spike like she was a piece of chicken on a shishkabob --

--	But he’s GOT her. KRAK! Trucker wraps his good arm around her, grits his teeth through his own pain --

TRUCKER HAT (CONT’D)
We gotta move.

--	SO THEY DO -- CLOSE ON TRUCKER, his arm around The Woman as they STUMBLE... and BLEED... as far away from the gunfire as they can fucking GET --

It’s okay...	TRUCKER HAT (CONT’D)	
	I got you...	I got y--	

CLICK.
 
19.


That doesn’t sound good. Trucker looks down at his workboot, which just stepped on the thing that CLICKED. It’s a pressure plate. Attached to a MINE.

In the movies, that mine will not detonate until you remove your foot and you can make your peace with God and/or attempt to fashion a fancy way of surviving like when Indiana Jones puts a bag of sand on that thing to get the gold idol. But in real life? The second you step on that shit?

THWOOM!	IT EXPLODES.

As does TRUCKER.	He’s BLOWN APART like a gut-filled piñata.

Freckles is THROWN by the blast, lands in a heap on the ground. Which would make her our hero...

Except half her body is missing.

The OTHER half -- SKLISH! -- HAS LANDED RIGHT BACK ON THE SKEWER from which it was just removed.

-- And now A MAN carrying a PISTOL is running up to her -- Wearing shirtsleeves and a rumpled tie -- Receding HAIRLINE -- He crouches beside her, taking in the carnage --

HAIRLINE
... Aw fuck...

FRECKLES
... Shoot me.

He seems confused by the request... She reaches out with bloody hands, grabs his gun, POINTS IT AT HERSELF --

HAIRLINE
... Wait... Hold on... Don’t --

FRECKLES
--	LEGGO YOU FUCKING SNOWFLAKE!

--	She PULLS the gun from his hand, puts in her own mouth --

BLAM!!!	BLOWS THE BRAINS OUT THE BACK OF HER HEAD!!!

Okay. We know this is getting tired, but it’s settled now. We’ve only just met him. But somehow this guy -- HAIRLINE --

He’s gonna be our hero.

And we don’t hear the gunfire anymore... it’s either stopped or we’ve gotten far enough away from it. But Hairline ain’t waiting around for it to start up again --
 
20.


-- He grabs the GUN out of Freckles’ hand and starts to run --
FAST -- HUFFING AND PUFFING -- BOBBING AND WEAVING THROUGH THE TREES -- And now he’s suddenly running --

--	UPHILL. Using rocks and branches to pull himself forward. He half-runs, half-climbs to the top of the incline --

And then he stops DEAD as he sees what’s before him --


EXT. ROAD - DAY

... It’s a ROAD.

Flat and paved. It winds off into the woods in both directions. And now, a FOOTBALL FIELD AWAY --

MORE PEOPLE break from the treeline. TWO of them. Hairline points his gun at them --

--	They see him -- THROW UP THEIR HANDS -- He recognizes them from the crate. PREY. Just like him. And then, a sound right BEHIND HIM. Hairline SPINS, gun raised --

VOICE
--	WHOA!!!

--	A MAN comes out with his hands up.  It’s BUDWEISER.

BUDWEISER
... Don’t shoot, asshole.

Hairline lowers his gun, relieved... another FRIENDLY. Budweiser nods towards the OTHER TWO, now making their way down the road towards them --

BUDWEISER (CONT’D)
They with us?

HAIRLINE
Yeah.
(then)

Whatever that means.

Budweiser takes in the road --

BUDWEISER
Civilization.

HAIRLINE
... Huh?
 
21.


BUDWEISER
Road means civilization.

Civilization’s our fucking friend.

The other two have reached them now. One is a MAN with long hair and a jean jacket. Let’s call him KID ROCK.

The other is a stocky WOMAN wearing a flannel shirt. Not a lumberjack, but a LUMBERJANE.

KID ROCK
Y’all got guns?

Hairline and Budweiser show that they do --

KID ROCK (CONT’D)
Aright, let’s go.

HAIRLINE
Go where?

KID ROCK
(points to the woods)

Away from the motherfucker shootin’ at us.

HAIRLINE
ZZZZZZ.

LUMBERJANE
... What?

HAIRLINE
Motherfuckerzzzzz.	There’s more
than one of ‘em.
(beat)

You know what this is, don’t you?

A beat. It would seem Hairline has figured something OUT. Something the rest of them are (literally) dying to know --

HAIRLINE (CONT’D)
It’s goddam Manorgate.

“MANORGATE.”

That word means nothing to us. Why would it? It does, however, seem to mean something to THEM.

LUMBERJANE
It’s... real?

KID ROCK
Feels pretty fucking real to me.
 
22.


What’s real? What’s happening? We’ll have to wait because before this can be further discussed --

A sound.	An ENGINE.	They all turn towards it --

AN OLD-SCHOOL VW BUS, coming down the road towards them. Budweiser doesn’t even think, steps onto the edge of the road, WAVING IT DOWN --

BUDWEISER
HEY!!!!

Hairline and the others ain’t so sure --

HAIRLINE
The fuck’re you doing?!?

BUDWEISER
GETTIN’ US RESCUED!!!
(back to waving)

HEY!	HELP!!!!

Now, if one wanted to rescue a deserted motorist, one might slow down and pull to the side of the road to do so...

One would not accelerate and veer across the double yellow line FULL SPEED AHEAD TOWARDS THE PERSON WAVING THEM DOWN --

BUDWEISER (CONT’D)
Shit.

Hairline doesn’t hesitate -- BLAMBLAMBLAM! -- Raises his gun and STARTS FIRING at the VW just as --

--	FWAAAAAAAAAAK!  The VW SMASHES into Budweiser -- His body
FLIES THROUGH THE AIR -- AND LANDS IN A MANGLED HEAP TWENTY YARDS AWAY, JUST IN TIME FOR THE VW TO RUN OVER HIM, DRAGGING HIS BODY DOWN THE ROAD --

--	BLAMBLAMBLAM--klik! -- Hairline empties his magazine and maybe it’s Budweiser’s corpse getting caught up in the transmission and maybe Hairline actually HIT the Driver but --

--	The VW veers off the road -- CRASHES INTO A TREE and comes to a stop.

Hairline lowers his gun arm, surprised. Kid Rock and Lumberjane stand behind him, impressed. She whistles --

LUMBERJANE
Shit, Baldy.	You got the sumbitch.

Hairline allows himself a small smile of satisfaction. Fucking-A-Right, he got the sumb--
 
23.


--	THE VW’S ENGINE REVS -- DIRT FLIES from beneath its rear tires as it attempts to unstick itself from the TREE.

Hairline is no dummy. His gun is empty. And his head start will be gone the moment the VW and that tree part ways. So he does the only sensible thing --

HAIRLINE
RUN!!!!

-- So once again, WE ARE RUNNING -- HANDHELD and CHAOTIC -- Moving with Hairline as he HUFFS AND PUFFS on the edge of the road, checks over his shoulder TO SEE --

--	Kid Rock and Lumberjane, following his lead -- In the distance, the VW continues to REV, but it’s still STUCK -- And now, as he rounds a curve in the forested road --

A MIRACLE.

Just a couple hundred yards up the road -- A SMALL, COUNTRY SERVICE STATION.

It’s a roadside Chevron, straight out of a Coen Brothers Movie. An OASIS.

Hairline QUICKENS HIS PACE -- a second (if not third or fourth) wind upon seeing this oasis of safety -- PUSHING HARDER AND HARDER for the station until he finally --


INT. MA & POP’S GAS STATION - CONTINUOUS

--	BURSTS THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR.

A TINKLE of a small bell above the hinge to announce a customer has arrived...

And a moment.	Just a moment.	To breathe.

A few aisles of sundries -- CHIPS and GUM and JERKY. A couple of humming FREEZERS with an assortment of beverages.

FOX NEWS plays on a TV SET above the counter, currently being watched by the station’s owners --

MA and POP.

Early seventies. Salt of the earth. Southern accents. They turn towards Hairline, sweaty, out of breath... and HOLDING HIS FUCKING GUN AT HIS SIDE.

Pop puts up his hands, nervous --
 
24.


POP
... There’s thirty dollars in the

register.	S’all yours.

HAIRLINE
Where are we?

MA
... What?

POP
... Look, son -- We don’t want no trouble. Just take the money and--

HAIRLINE
--	I don’t want your damn money. Where the fuck ARE we?

Ma and Pop exchange a confused look --

MA
Route 31... Just outside Elaine.

HAIRLINE
Elaine where?	What state?!?

MA
Arkansas.

--	THE DOOR SLAMS OPEN -- Kid Rock and Lumberjane BURST INTO the store as Hairline turns to them, exasperated --

HAIRLINE
Arkansas!

KID ROCK
... What?

LUMBERJANE
We’re in Arkansas?

HAIRLINE
Fucking.	Arkansas.

KID ROCK
Jesus.

HAIRLINE
C’mon... gimme a hand --

Hairline grabs a LARGE MAGAZINE RACK, starts to pull it to BLOCK THE DOORS. Kid and Lumberjane pitch in.
 
25.


--	THE RACK slides in front of the doors. Hairline looks out the window -- Coast SEEMS clear. Turns towards a terrified Ma and Pop --

HAIRLINE (CONT’D)
You got a phone?

MA
Please... please... we have

children... Grandchildren.

HAIRLINE
Do your grandchildren have a phone? Because that’s all I’m asking for, lady. A fucking phone.

Ma, still freaked, picks a cordless receiver from its dock on the counter, offers it to Hairline who takes it and DIALS --

POP
Son... whatever’s goin’ on h--

HAIRLINE
--	What’s goin’ on here is we’re bein’ goddam hunted.

Ma takes them in.	Furrows her brow.

MA
But y’all have guns.

HAIRLINE
For defense.

KLK -- A calm FEMALE DISPATCH through the receiver pressed to Hairline’s ear --

DISPATCH (O.S.)
9-1-1, What’s your emergency?

HAIRLINE (INTO PHONE)
Hello... yeah... there’s a

fuckin’... murder spree happenin’ -- You need to get out here right now.

DISPATCH (O.S.)
(a beat; then)

There’s a... what happening, sir?

HAIRLINE
A murder spree.	A massacre.	Out
in the woods.	It’s Manorgate!

That WORD again.	But Dispatch is as CLUELESS as we are --
 
26.


DISPATCH (O.S.)
I’m sorry, sir... What?

HAIRLINE
Manorgate.	Fucking... Google it!

DISPATCH (O.S.)
I can’t do that right n--

HAIRLINE
--	Jesus... just --- Listen -- We woke up with these... gags on our mouths... with locks and --

DISPATCH (O.S.)
--	“Woke up,” sir?

Kid Rock keeps anxious watch from behind the magazine stand blocking the door -- Lumberjane wanders through the snack aisles, looking for something to eat --

HAIRLINE (INTO PHONE) I was in Staten Island... New York. At a bar after work. And that’s the last thing I... They musta drugged me. They drugged all of us --
(shouts to the others)

Where’d they get you from?

KID ROCK
Orlando.

LUMBERJANE
Wyoming.

HAIRLINE
Fuck... okay...
(back into phone)

Listen -- They grabbed us from all over and brought us here to kill us and they’re still trying to kill us, they’re right down the fucking road in a VW VAN and they’re gonna be here any fucking second!

DISPATCH (O.S.)
What is your current location, sir?

HAIRLINE
I’m at a gas station... can’t you

just trace me?

A beat.
 
27.


DISPATCH (O.S.)
Of course.	That’s a great idea.
We’ll trace you, sir.

Hairline furrows his brow.

HAIRLINE
Okay... good.

DISPATCH (O.S.)
Sit tight.	Help is on the way.

KLIK.	Dispatch hangs up.	Hairline looks at the phone.	Huh.

KID ROCK
What’d they say?

HAIRLINE
They said they’re comin’.

LUMBERJANE
Thank Christ.

She finds a box of RITZ CRACKERS.	Takes it from the shelf.

KID ROCK
Gimme one of those.

LUMBERJANE
Get your own box.

She gestures to the cracker aisle as Hairline returns the phone to the counter where Ma and Pop remain, hands up, unsettled by the chaos that has descended upon their sleepy little store. Pa nods to Hairline --

PA
Son... you mind puttin’ that gun away? You seem a little... worked up and you wouldn’t want it to go off on accident.

Hairline seems offended by the implication --

HAIRLINE
It’s not gonna go off on

“accident.” I own seven guns.

MA
Why?

HAIRLINE
... What?
 
28.


MA
Why do you own seven guns?

HAIRLINE
Because it’s my constitutional right to protect myself should I ever happen to be getting shot at like I am right fuckin’ now. Okay?

MA
Sure.	Okay.

And that’s the end of it.	Except --

MA (CONT’D)
So... the people shootin’ at you...
They’re just exercisin’ the very

same right.

Hairline raises an eyebrow --

HAIRLINE
... What the hell’re you talking

about, lady?

MA
Will there still be sugar after the rebellion?

WHAT?!? This is just... WEIRD now. Hairline looks at Pa, nods to Ma as if she’s clearly suffering from Alzheimer’s --

HAIRLINE
She okay?

PA
Sure.	She’s fine.
(smiles)

How’re you?

ON HAIRLINE.	Something is very... not right here.	Then --

KID ROCK
... The fuck?

Hairline turns towards Kid Rock, who stands there in the food aisle looking into his Ritz Cracker box, CONFUSED.

HAIRLINE
What?

Kid Rock turns the box over. WHITE POWDER pours out on the floor. Flour? SUGAR?
 
29.


The fuck INDEED.

Hairline strides over... grabs a third box off the shelf...
rips it open, turns it over. MORE POWDER. Hairline is confused, turns towards Ma and Pa at the counter --

HAIRLINE (CONT’D)
What the hell is th--?

--	But he never finishes his sentence. Because while his back was turned, we failed to notice...

Ma and Pa have put on GAS MASKS.

Oh.	And also, Pa is holding a SAWED-OFF SHOTGUN.

HAIRLINE (CONT’D)
Wait...

--	KRAKOW!!! Hairline’s CHEST EXPLODES -- HIS BODY FLIES BACK INTO LUMBERJANE AS IF HE’S BEEN KICKED BY A MULE.

--	Lumberjane just stands there in numb shock as Kid Rock turns from the magazine rack that’s now preventing him from escaping, reaches for his gun --

KID ROCK
Whoawhoawhoa...

--	But Ma is already holding a CANISTER in her hands --She pulls the PIN -- Tosses it right at Kid Rock’s feet where --

It EXPELS A PLUME OF GAS RIGHT UP INTO HIS FACE.

This is not tear gas. It is something much, much NASTIER. Kid’s eyes BULGE as he hits the ground -- starts to CONVULSE, foaming at the MOUTH --

--	Lumberjane SHRIEKS, tries to push HAIRLINE’S BODY off of her, struggling to get up --

--	But here’s POP, out from behind the counter, loading fresh shells into the shotgun as he approaches her --

MA (THRU GASMASK)
DON’T MAKE A MESS!

POP (THRU GASMASK)
WHAT?

MA (THRU GASMASK)
I’M NOT CLEANING HER UP!

Pop considers that.	Nods.
 
30.


POP (THRU GASMASK)
THROW ME A CAN.

She produces another CANISTER, tosses it to Pop who catches it, kneels beside a still-struggling Lumberjane, extends the canister towards her face as --

--	She SPITS into the glass circle of the gasmask that covers Pa’s eye. Hisses at him --

LUMBERJANE
You’re goin’ to hell.

Pop leans in, all traces of his folksy charm (and southern accent) now gone as he cooly intones through his gasmask --

POP (THRU GASMASK) I don’t believe in hell, young lady. As you so eloquently wrote, I’m a Godless elite and I feed the murdered babies I pull from their mother’s wombs to my purebread fucking poodles.

Wait.	“As you so eloquently wrote?!?”

We don’t know what the FUCK he’s talking about. But based on the surprised look on Lumberjane’s face, in this, her final moment on Earth?

SHE knows.

POP (CONT’D)
For the record...
(beat)

Climate change is real.

And with that -- TUNK! -- He PULLS THE PIN. FSSSSSSSS! A BLAST OF GAS RIGHT INTO HER FACE! She SPASMS underneath Hairline’s corpse, but it doesn’t take long for her to go still as Pop rises to his feet. Turns back to Ma --

POP (CONT’D)
YOU CAN HIT THE VENT, HONEY!

Ma nods, reaches under the counter and flips a SWITCH.

VROOOOOOOO! What sounds like a massive VACUUM CLEANER FROM A VENT IN THE CEILING IN THE CENTER OF THE STORE as --

--	All of the lingering GAS gets sucked up INTO THE VENT. In just ten short seconds, the air is once again CLEAR.

Pa pulls off his gas mask.	Ma pulls off hers.
 
31.


They take in their handiwork.	THREE BODIES.

We still have no fucking clue what’s going on here. Or WHY it’s going on. But it’s now abundantly clear that these dead folks are, as Hairline surmised, THE HUNTED. And Ma and Pa?

Well, they’re the fucking HUNTERS.

POP (CONT’D)
I’ll get a mop.

SMASH TO:


INT. MA & POP’S GAS STATION -	A LITTLE LATER

A WET MOP WORKS it’s way across the floor, cleaning up the last of Hairline’s life blood in a puddle of pink water as --

MA grunts as she drags Lumberjane’s body into a STORAGE CLOSET where we glimpse the other two corpses.

She piles Lumberjane in with the others... in doing so, Kid Rock’s arm THWUMPS down. Ma hesitates, seeing something --

POP
... What?

MA
Nothing.

POP
Tell me, honey -- What’s wrong?

A beat.

MA
He’s... wearing a wedding ring.

Pop shrugs.

POP
Don’t.	He’s a monster.

Ma looks at the body, not without empathy for the life she has taken. Pop sighs.

POP (CONT’D)
Honey. Twelve arrests for drunk and disorderly. Five for domestic abuse... and he uses the N-word on Twitter.

(MORE)
 
32.

POP (CONT’D)
Those people suffered four hundred years of bondage at the hands of that uneducated piece of shit’s ancestors -- Four hundred years.

MA
“Those people?”

Pop shakes his head guiltily -- Of course, she’s right.

POP
Sorry... African Americans.

MA
Privilege, Julius.

POP
Yeah, yeah.	I know.

A BURST OF STATIC from behind the counter.	A FEMALE VOICE --

FEMALE VOICE (OVER WALKIE)
Hello?	Come in?	You there?

Pa plops the mop back into the rolling bucket, cleanup complete as Ma heads over to the counter, pulls a WALKIE TALKIE out of a drawer, KEYS IT --

MA (INTO WALKIE)
Hey.	We’re here.
(beat)
We got three.	Mollie, Moses and
Mr. Frederick.

“MOLLIE?”	“MOSES?”	“MR. FREDERICK?”	WHAT?!?!?

FEMALE VOICE (OVER WALKIE) Yeah? Great. Martin got Clover. It was absolutely brutal.

Ma doesn’t quite know what to say to that.

FEMALE VOICE (OVER WALKIE) (CONT’D)
Anyway, Snowball’s headed towards you now, she’s maybe five minutes out. You gonna be ready, or do you need us to slow her down?

Ma looks over to Pop, who has pushed the bucket into the supply closet. He nods --

POP
We’re good.
 
33.


Ma nods too, back into the walkie --

MA (INTO WALKIE)
No need... all set here.

FEMALE VOICE (OVER WALKIE) Great. She’s unarmed, so have some fun with it.

MA (INTO WALKIE)
Copy that.	Uh... over and out.

She clicks off the walkie, puts it back in the drawer. Sees Pa has opened the fridge, helps himself to a CAN OF COKE.

MA (CONT’D)
(disapproving)

Honey.	That’s poison.

POP
... We rigged the soda?

MA
No.	But it has chemical 4-
methylimidazole and thirty nine

grams of sugar in it.

POP
(smiles disarmingly)

You’re always looking out for me.

She smiles back as he puts the can back in the fridge --

MA
.... Alrighty then.
(claps her hands)

Let’s get some more!

SMASH TO:


INT. MA & POP’S GAS STATION - A FEW MINUTES LATER... AGAIN

Once again, FOX NEWS plays on the TV.

If we were paying careful attention, we might notice it’s the exact same story that was on before... REWOUND. Ma and Pop are back in position behind the counter to spring their trap. Could it be...

That THEY are our heroes?

MA
... Here she comes.
 
34.


MA’S POV -- Out through the GLASS FRONT DOOR (the magazine rack has been pushed back to its place) as they see --

A WOMAN walking past the gas pumps. Hard to entirely make her out from here. And then... she abruptly STOPS.

Pop’s got his back to the door, pretending to watch TV. He furrows his brow. Quietly asks --

POP
What’s going on?

Ma tries not to move her lips as she responds, confused --

MA
She stopped.

POP
... Why?

MA
I don’t know, Julius.

But the question is moot as the woman continues on her way, opens the door with the TINKLE of the bell --

It’s CRYSTAL.

The woman in the National Car Rental shirt. Who fashioned her own compass. And somehow, between when we last saw her and now, found a way to get her GAG off. How she unlocked it doesn’t matter... Let’s just leave it at she knows how to do shit. And here’s the thing --

While Hairline burst in with all the MANIC ENERGY one would expect of someone who just witnessed multiple people dying around him whilst being shot at? Crystal? Well...

Crystal is mellow fucking yellow.

And Ma and Pop are a little... unsettled by that. But his faux Southern accent is back in full effect --

POP
Hey there.	Help you?

Crystal walks up to the counter.	A long beat.	Finally --

CRYSTAL
Pack of Marlboro reds.

Okay. NOT what Ma and Pop were expecting. Us either. But Ma shakes it off --
 
35.


MA
You got it.

She turns to the display of cigarettes as Crystal just stares at Pop. He forces a smile --

POP
You wanna fill ‘er up?

She just stares.

POP (CONT’D)
Your car?

CRYSTAL
Don’t have a car.

Pop tries his best to seem surprised --

POP
Oh... you walk over?

Again. She just stares. Ma returns with the cigarettes. Places them down on the counter -- right above the concealed sawed-off shotgun. Crystal kneels --

POP (CONT’D)
Everything okay?

-- She pulls up her pantleg, reaches into her sock --

CRYSTAL
Lost my wallet.

--	Pulls out a FOLDED TWENTY DOLLAR BILL, rises, places it on the counter.

CRYSTAL (CONT’D)
For emergencies.

Ma smiles congenially, takes the bill, rings her up --

MA
You need matches, hon?

CRYSTAL
(nods)

What state is this?

POP
... Sorry?

CRYSTAL
You don’t understand the question?
 
36.


POP
No... I... it’s just... most people know where they’re at.

CRYSTAL
I ain’t most people.

No.	She most assuredly is NOT.

This isn’t going at all the way that Ma and Pop would expect.

Shouldn’t Crystal be terrified?	Freaked out?

Pop’s hand drops down to the butt of the shotgun, but Ma keeps up the act, puts Crystal’s CHANGE on the counter --

MA
You’re in the glorious state of

Arkansas, sweetheart.

Crystal nods. Picks up her change. Ten bucks and a couple of coins. Looks at it in her hand.

MA (CONT’D)
Anything else we can get for y--

--	WHAM!  Crystal punches Ma in the face.  Fucking HARD.

Ma staggers back -- goes DOWN -- Pa fumbles for the shotgun --

--	But Crystal is already VAULTING over the counter, KICKING HIM IN THE CHEST. And now that she’s on the other side --

--	She sees the shotgun, pulls it out, and without even a fucking MOMENT of hesitation --

--	BLAM!!!  BLOWS PA’S HEAD OFF HIS SHOULDERS!

MA SCREAMS, LOOKS UP AT CRYSTAL with terror as the shotgun swings towards her to do the same --

CRYSTAL
Cigarettes in Arkansas only cost
six bucks.
(beat)

You fucked up, bitch.

MA
WAIT!	PL--

--	BLAM!!! MA’S FACE DISAPPEARS IN AN EXPLOSION OF GORE. Crystal lowers the shotgun.
 
37.


Jesus.

Now, she tucks the shotgun into her armpit, opens up the pack of Reds.

It’s EMPTY.

Crystal frowns... but there are more important things to attend to. She’s in RECON mode. Opens up a drawer --

SHOTGUN SHELLS. She takes two handfuls, stuffs them into her pockets, expertly LOADS the sawed-off as she spots --

THE WALKIE. She grabs it, clips it to her belt, heads back around the counter GRABBING A BAG OF JERKY as we FOLLOW HER --

EXT. GAS STATION - DAY - MOMENTS LATER -- OUT BACK.
There’s a PICKUP TRUCK parked here.	Arkansas plates.
Crystal approaches it, noticing something OFF...

... There aren’t any screws on the LICENSE PLATE.

Huh.

She grabs the plate with both hands and YANKS. It UNSTICKS from the bumper. Revealing a NARROWER PLATE. Lots of numbers and letters. Like you’d see OVERSEAS.

But Crystal has noticed something ELSE now --

She crouches lower. There’s some kind of PACKAGE taped under the car. It looks a lot like --

--	A BOMB. C-4 PACKETS with a thin FISHING LINE sticking out of them. She tracks the line from under the car to find --

It’s TIED TO to the DRIVER’S SIDE DOOR HANDLE.

Another BOOBY TRAP.

But Crystal ain’t no booby. She rises -- looks around. CLOSE ON HER EYES as they move back and forth. She’s thinking. Thinking what to do next.

Thinking of a PLAN.

Her eyes STOP. Focus. Whatever she’s looking for, she just fucking FOUND it as we SMASH TO:
 
38.


EXT. HILLTOP - OVERLOOKING GAS STATION - DAY

--	A TREE-COVERED hilltop with a perfect VANTAGE POINT of the gas station down below.

Crystal HUNKERS DOWN behind a tree, eyes on the station, shotgun in one hand, opened bag of jerky in the other. She chews on the dry meat.

Waiting.

Finally -- A BURST OF STATIC from the walkie on her belt --

FEMALE VOICE (OVER WALKIE)
... Hello?	Come in?

Crystal grabs the walkie... LOWERS the volume, holds it to her ear --

FEMALE VOICE (OVER WALKIE) (CONT’D)
... Julius?	Miranda?	You there?

Of course, there is no response. Because Julius and Miranda no longer have heads. The voice seems WORRIED now --

FEMALE VOICE (OVER WALKIE) (CONT’D)
... Dale, are you on?

ANOTHER VOICE, now... a MAN --

MALE VOICE (OVER WALKIE)
Affirmative.	I’m here.

FEMALE VOICE (OVER WALKIE)
Did anyone see Snowball go in?

Crystal’s eyes narrow.	Is SHE “Snowball?”

MALE VOICE (OVER WALKIE)
No... We lost visual at the road.

FEMALE VOICE (OVER WALKIE)
Why don’t you go take a look.

MALE VOICE (OVER WALKIE)
Ten-four.

Crystal chews on another piece of jerky, but it isn’t long before she HEARS SOMETHING. A high pitched WHIRRING. And it’s getting progressively louder.

Something is COMING.
