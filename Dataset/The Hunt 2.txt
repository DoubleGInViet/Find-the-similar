Crystal dips down even lower behind the cover of her tree,
narrowing her eyes as the source finally reveals itself --

Coming from far off in the distance.	But approaching fast.

It’s a DRONE.

Crystal gets LOW as it flies up to the gas station WINDOW. The radio crackles --

MALE VOICE (OVER WALKIE) (CONT’D)
... I don’t see anybody inside.

Checking the back now.

The drone banks to do just that when --

--	BANG!

It’s shot out of the air!!!

MALE VOICE (OVER WALKIE) (CONT’D)
... Shit.	I lost...

FEMALE VOICE (OVER WALKIE)
-- What happened?

MALE VOICE (OVER WALKIE) I can’t see anything. The signal went out.

FEMALE VOICE (OVER WALKIE)
Turn your radio off.

MALE VOICE (OVER WALKIE)
... What?

FEMALE VOICE (OVER WALKIE)
Turn your fucking radio off, now.

KLK.	Crystal’s walkie goes silent.	She grunts to herself--

CRYSTAL
... Least one of you’s smart.

And now, in THE DISTANCE --

A HEAVYSET MAN (30s) comes out of the woods. He approaches the drone nervously.


It would seem, from his general appearance, that this man is an ally. But Crystal can’t be sure.

Heavyset pokes the drone with his toe. It doesn’t move. He STOMPS on it. Smashing it to pieces. Then he moves on to the TRUCK...
 
40.


... The one with C4 EXPLOSIVES wired under it. Heavyset approaches the driver-side DOOR -- Reaches out toward the handle. Crystal WHISTLES.

Heavyset wheels around, PISTOL raised, looking for the source of the sound. And can’t find it. Until Crystal, slowly, steps up out of her hunting blind. Gun raised.

HEAVYSET
... DON’T FUCKING MOVE!

-- She keeps moving, calm --

CRYSTAL
Lower your gun -- I’m a friendly.

HEAVYSET
HOW DO I KNOW THAT?!?

CRYSTAL
Pull that door handle, blow the

fuck up, then you’ll know.

Heavyset looks closer at the door handle.	Sees the WIRE.

HEAVYSET
Well, shit.
(beat)

Thanks.

But Crystal couldn’t care less... she’s already walking off into the woods.

HEAVYSET (CONT’D)
Where you goin’?

CRYSTAL
Saw some tracks earlier.	Gonna
follow ‘em.

HEAVYSET
... Whose tracks?

But she doesn’t answer.	Keeps moving.

HEAVYSET (CONT’D)
Hey!!!	WHOSE TRACKS???

CUT TO:
 
41.


EXT. TRAIN TRACKS - DAY

TRAIN TRACKS. Winding through the WOODS. Crystal walks along them. Heavyset keeping pace behind her, clearly just downloaded on her adventure in the GAS STATION --

HEAVSETY
... Why were they pretendin’ to

work there?

CRYSTAL
Don’t care.

HEAVYSET
Why didn’t they just kill you when you came in?

CRYSTAL
Don’t care.

HEAVYSET
You wanna hear my theory?

CRYSTAL
Not really.

-- But he’s gonna give it to her anyway --

HEAVYSET
I saw this article -- Every year, these liberal elites... y’know, The globalist cucks who run the Deep State? They kidnap a bunch of normal folks like us and then hunt us for fucking sport at this mansion in like, Vermont or something. I forwarded it to fifty friends... but it’s not like I believed it.
(beat)

Do you believe it?

CRYSTAL
That you have fifty friends?

HEAVYSET
No.	The rest of it.

It’s a lot to take in, but all Crystal says is --

CRYSTAL
This ain’t Vermont.
 
42.


Heavyset furrows his brow as she breaks from the tracks and heads into the woods --

HEAVYSET
Now where you goin’?

She doesn’t answer. Just steps behind a tree, pulls down her pants and SQUATS.

ON HEAVYSET -- He turns away, embarrassed as we hear the sound of her piss on the ground... Feels like he needs to say something --

HEAVYSET (CONT’D)
I’m Gary.

Crystal stands.	Pulls up her pants --

CRYSTAL
Shut the fuck up, Gary.

She walks back towards the tracks... and now we hear something. A distant something approaching. Crystal takes a knee, puts her hand on the tracks.

CRYSTAL (CONT’D)
How fast’re you?

GARY
... What?

CRYSTAL
Train’ll be going at least thirty-five -- We’re not gonna be able to get on standin’ still.

Louder now. Something coming around the bend ahead. A TRAIN. And Crystal ain’t waiting... she takes OFF RUNNING --

GARY
Wait...

--	So Gary has no choice but to start running, too as THE CHUGGING SOUND of the train gets LOUDER --

Crystal’s arms pump at her sides, her face strained as she pushes herself into a full-out fucking sprint. The train bearing down on them --

--	She lets the LOCOMOTIVE pass, then counts as the first three FREIGHT CARS pass too. Timing them. Then she jumps --
 
43.


EXT. TRAIN - CONNECTION PLATFORM - DAY

--	LANDING on the PLATFORM between two cars.

And doing so in a perfect fucking NINJA CROUCH. Like she’s done that shit a thousand times before.

Which maybe she has.

Gary, on the other hand, is fat and out of shape and completely fucking new to this. As he lands on the platform behind her, his FOOT slips out from under him and he FALLS BACK, arms FLAILING...

Crystal grabs him and hauls him back to safety. Then she yanks open the freight car DOOR, pushing Gary in --


INT. TRAIN - FREIGHT CAR - DAY

-- Where he collapses, panting and shaken.

GARY
Holy... shit.

CRYSTAL
Get up.

Crystal scowls, blinking, waiting for her eyes to adjust to the darkness. Then takes a couple of steps forward... And stops. Staring. Gary is, too. We CUT AROUND and see why:

A group of REFUGEES are hiding in this TRAIN CAR.

There’s about TEN of them, all different ages and genders. Maybe Middle-Eastern? SYRIANS? They’re just as surprised as Crystal and Gary are.

Especially because Crystal is holding a fucking SHOTGUN.

A refugee BABY starts to cry. For a moment its sobs and the rattle of the train are the only sound.

Finally, one of the REFUGEES says something in ARABIC, (seemingly) frightened --

REFUGEE MAN (IN ARABIC)
... Nahn ghyr musalihina.

Gary raises his gun --

GARY
English.
 
44.


The Refugees react -- NERVOUS -- but they could just be acting nervous. Gary turns to Crystal, paranoid --

GARY (CONT’D)
How do we know they ain’t part of

this?	What if they’re not real?

Crystal turns to them, very, very chill, almost PLEASANT --

CRYSTAL
I’ve got a drawing in my pocket of your holy prophet sucking himself off... who wants to see it?

Crystal studies them, but they’re CONFUSED -- So she asks --

CRYSTAL (CONT’D)
If one of you doesn’t say something in English in three seconds, I’m gonna shoot all the men in their kneecaps. One. Two...
(a beat)
Two and a half...

-- She sighs, lowers her gun, turning to Gary --

CRYSTAL (CONT’D)
They’re real.

Okay then.	Gary lowers his gun.	Asks the obvious --

GARY
... Who are they?

CRYSTAL
Refugees.	Probably tryin’ to do
the same thing we are.

GARY
... Which is what?

CRYSTAL
Escape.

-- A WHISTLE sounds.	Shit.	The train’s SLOWING DOWN.

The refugees PANIC. Whispering frantically in Arabic. One of them reaches into a BACKPACK and Crystal instinctively raises her gun again...

... But all he pulls out is an ORANGE.

Crystal looks at it, confused. The man peels the orange, then squeezes the JUICE over his face and body.
 
45.


The OTHER REFUGEES do this too. Smearing the pulp on themselves, using the RIND to rub it in.

BACKPACK
Put!

The BACKPACK GUY holds an orange out to Crystal --

CRYSTAL
... What?

BACKPACK
Alkalb.	Woof woof.

CRYSTAL
You mean dog?

Backpack nods.

BACKPACK
Woof woof!	Put.	Put.

--	Crystal GETS it. It’s to disguise their SCENT. She grabs the orange... starts peeling it as she turns to Gary --

CRYSTAL
You heard him.	Put.

--	Crystal rubs the orange over her body -- Gary grabs one
and does the same -- and sure enough, we hear REAL woofs from outside -- FUCKING DOGS as --

--	Crystal finds a SLAT in the side of the car and looks through. TWO BORDER AGENTS IN MILITARY FATIGUES walk alongside the train with a fierce-looking GERMAN SHEPHERD.

The agents reach Crystal’s car. Giving the DOG plenty of time to sniff around the traincar...

It’s TENSE. But the refugees are silent. As are Gary and Crystal. And so eventually the dog MOVES ON...

Apparently, the oranges weren’t the dumbest idea of all time.

Or maybe they were.

Either way, it doesn’t matter. Because just as the Border Agents are walking away, the BABY starts to cry.

Goddamn babies.

Its MOTHER panics -- holding her hand over the baby’s mouth, but this just makes it cry LOUDER. The dog starts BARKING. Crystal sees the chessboard three moves from now, to Gary --
 
46.


CRYSTAL (CONT’D)
Toss your gun.

GARY
... What?

CRYSTAL
Toss it or we’re fucking dead.

She takes her shotgun, SLIDES it across the boxcar floor. Gary follows suit just as --

--	A CASCADE OF SUNLIGHT as the door of the freight car SLIDES OPEN revealing the TWO BORDER AGENTS and their snarling dog -- Large AUTOMATIC WEAPONS raised --

BORDER AGENT
OTICI SVLAKA!

--	This is clearly NOT English either, but the meaning ain’t too hard to derive... “GET OFF THE FUCKING TRAIN.”

Hands raised above her head, Crystal does, stepping down... Gary and the REFUGEES following suit behind her --

--	THE DOGS BARK FIERCELY -- ONE LUNGES at a REFUGEE -- IT’S SCARY -- THE BABY CRIES LOUDER -- And now we’re --


EXT. TRAIN - BORDER CHECKPOINT - DAY

--	OUTSIDE ON A RAMSHACKLE TRAIN PLATFORM -- A makeshift CHECKPOINT -- The AGENTS shout in a FOREIGN TONGUE --

BORDER AGENT
RUKE NA VLAKU!

HALF A DOZEN other BORDER AGENTS with assault rifles descend on us -- FORCIBLY pushing the refugees up against the train -- SEARCHING THEM -- THE DOGS SNARL AND BITE --

-- In the midst of it all, Crystal.	Somehow, she stays COOL.

CRYSTAL
American.	I’m American.

--	And this gives the AGENT IN CHARGE pause -- Wherever they are in the world, that word has POWER. It always does.

AGENT IN CHARGE
... American?

Gary follows suit, points to himself --
 
47.


GARY
Me too!	American.

The Agent furrows his brow, turns to one of his cohorts.
Unsure of what to do here...

... But as Crystal and Gary are now getting slightly preferential treatment, a BEARDED REFUGEE SPEAKS UP --

BEARDED REFUGEE
America!	America too!

He points to himself.

Gary, a true patriot, is understandably and deeply OFFENDED --

GARY
Uh UH -- NO!	No he’s fucking not!

But the Bearded Refugee makes his case emphatically --

BEARDED REFUGEE
New York!	Hot dog!	Kendrick Lamar
Be Humble!

-- The Agents are confused.	Gary is IRATE --

GARY
That’s not English!	He’s just
saying shit --	Does he look
American to you?

BEARDED REFUGEE
--	Pizza Pie! Law Order Special Victim Unit! SuperBowl Yankees!

GARY
--	Yeah? Sing the Anthem. Sing the fucking Anthem, Mohammad!

--	DOGS SNARL -- Several of the other AGENTS are getting torqued -- GUNS UP --

--	THE BABY CRIES -- Crystal grits her teeth, turns to Gary --

CRYSTAL
... Shut up.

-- But he doesn’t -- HE SINGS --

GARY
OHHHHH SAY CAN YOU SEE?	BY THE
DAWN’S EARLY LIGHT?	C’MON ASSHOLE,
YOU KNOW THE WORDS!
(MORE)
 
48.

GARY (CONT'D)
WHAT SO PROUDLY WE HAILED... AT THE

TWILIGHT’S LAST GLEAMING!

--	The Agents are shouting at each other now in their foreign tongue, CONFUSED AND RATTLED -- AND ANGRY --

CRYSTAL
Shut.	UP.

-- DOGS BARKING -- LEAPING -- BABY CRIES --

GARY
WHOSE BROAD STRIPES AND BRIGHT STARS, THROUGH THE PERILOUS FIGHT! O’ER THE RAMPARTS WE WATCHED, WERE SO GALLANTLY STREAMING --
(to the Bearded Refugee)
--	WHY AREN’T YOU FUCKING SINGING, MR. AMERICAN??!?

--	It all kinda happens at ONCE -- A DOG LUNGES -- A WOMAN SCREAMS -- AN ERRANT SHOT GOES OFF and --

--	EVERYONE FUCKING SCATTERS IN COMPLETE AND UTTER PANIC.

BAM!-BAM!-BAM!-BAM!-BAM!

--	The Bearded Refugee’s skull disappears in an ONSLAUGHT OF RIFLE FIRE.

Gary stops singing... and RUNS!!!!

The Agents lose their cool... training kicks in as they INDISCRIMINATELY OPEN FIRE ON THE REFUGEES --

BAM!-BAM!-BAM!-BAM!-BAM!-BAM!-BAM!-BAM!-BAM!-BAM!

--	Crystal’s got instincts too -- She turns, heroically DIVES ON TOP OF THE MOTHER AND HER CRYING BABY.

ON CRYSTAL -- CLOSE ON HER FACE as bullets fly over her head and she HOLDS DOWN the mother and baby below her --

-- BODIES FALLING BESIDE THEM -- CARNAGE -- SLAUGHTHER -- DOGS BARKING -- IT’S THE END OF THE WORLD AND IT’S NEVER GONNA STOP...

... Until it does.

It’s QUIET.	The silence of death.	Crystal stays down.

Then, a pair of hands ROUGHLY PULLS Crystal up to her feet -- ROUGHLY PULLING A ZIP TIE AROUND HER WRISTS, hisses in his native tongue --
 
49.


BORDER AGENT
Ovo je tvoja krivica.

Crystal doesn’t understand him, but gets the gist. She looks down at the ground. They’re being roughly pulled to their feet as well, but miraculously --

The mother and the baby are still alive.

EVERYONE ELSE FROM THE TRAIN IS DEAD.	Except...

Crystal narrows her eyes, scanning the bodies as she’s marched past them... looking for Gary and not finding him...

He must have MADE IT.

But that’s of little solace to Crystal as she WIPES FRAME and we CUT TO:


INT. BORDER PATROL TRANSPORT VEHICLE - MOVING - DAY

--	The rear of a MILITARY TRANSPORT VEHICLE. ROCKING AND ROLLING OVER THE BUMPY ROAD. There’s two rows of BENCH SEATS in the back. Crystal, her zip-tied hands in her lap, sits stoically. Across from her --

THE MOTHER. Holding her baby to her chest. TEARS OF GRATITUDE streaming down her cheeks --

REFUGEE MOTHER
Thank.

Crystal looks at her. Are we finally gonna see a crack in that uncrackable facade --?

CRYSTAL
Only got on top of you ‘cause I knew they wouldn’t shoot the baby.

-- Nope.

CUT TO:


EXT. REFUGEE CAMP - CROATIA - DAY

--	A REFUGEE CAMP. The TRANSPORT VEHICLE pulls to a stop and a GUARD comes around and opens the back gate, unloading Crystal, the mother, and the child.

Crystal looks around the ENCAMPMENT. Tall FENCING surrounds the facility. BARBED WIRE at the top.
 
50.


There’s a couple of makeshift, corrugated-steel structures, but the place is mostly DIRT. And MUD.

And PEOPLE.	LOTS of people.

The camp is filled way-past capacity with REFUGEES of all different ages and sizes, all of them appearing to be MIDDLE-EASTERN. They looked tired and hungry and they’re clearly IMPRISONED here. It seems like Crystal’s about to be too.

A CAMP GUARD approaches her.	Broken English --

CAMP GUARD
You American?

CRYSTAL
Yeah.

Being American means something. He nods, grabs her by the arm. But he doesn’t lead her to the encampment. Instead they head toward a PRE-FAB OFFICE TRAILER.

UPCUT TO:


INT. OFFICE TRAILER - REFUGEE CAMP - DAY

-- THE TRAILER.	Inside of which is an OFFICE.

Crystal sits there alone, waiting. There’s almost nothing in this place. Just an ASH TRAY and a SWIMSUIT CALENDAR and a whole lot of Eastern European austerity.

Two BUREAUCRATS enter. One wears a cheap suit, the other just shirtsleeves and a tie. Both take a seat.

DINO
I’m Dino.
(gestures)

This Bojan.	You have papers?

CRYSTAL
Where are we?

Bojan lights a cigarette.

BOJAN
... You have name?

CRYSTAL
(repeats)

Where are we?

Dino lights a cigarette.
 
51.


DINO
Where you think?

CRYSTAL
Well... I was gettin’ some supper in Mississippi when I got knocked out for what was at least eighteen hours. Taking that into account, along with your accent and a license plate I saw, I’m guessing I’m probably in Bosnia.
(beat)

... Serbia?	Croatia?

Dino and Bojan make eye contact.	Bingo.

CRYSTAL (CONT’D)
Croatia then.

BOJAN
How you get here?

CRYSTAL
Don’t give a shit.	You need to
call the American embassy.

DINO
Show us papers.

CRYSTAL
I don’t have fucking papers. Call the embassy.

Bojan and Dino exchange a look.	A beat.	Then --

BOJAN
You hunted?

UH OH.	Crystal narrows her eyes.

CRYSTAL
Who said I was hunted?

BOJAN
Don.

DINO
You hunted like Don?

CRYSTAL
... Who the fuck is “Don?”

Bojan nods to Dino.
 
52.


BOJAN
Bring Don.

Dino gets up and leaves the office. Bojan puts out his cigarette stub. Lights another.

CRYSTAL
Can I get one a’ those?

BOJAN
No.

After a beat, Dino returns.	With him?

A ZIP-TIED MAN with a BLACK HOOD on his head.

Dino pushes him down into a chair next to Crystal. Then pulls the hood off, revealing --

-- COWBOY SHIRT.

The middle-aged SOUTHERN GOOD OL’ BOY from the CLEARING. He blinks. Sees Crystal. A flash of recognition --

COWBOY SHIRT
Howdy.

--	This must be DON. Crystal recognizes him, too. She turns back to Bojan --

CRYSTAL
Yeah.	Hunted like Don.

Don smiles satisfyingly, no longer in this alone --

COWBOY SHIRT
I told you assholes.

AND WE CUT TO:


EXT. REFUGEE CAMP - DAY

--	Crystal and Don stand in line with a bunch of hungry-looking REFUGEES. Each with a banged-up metal BOWL no SPOON. Waiting to eat from a BIG POT of God-knows-what.

DON
... I was headin’ north when the dogs came after me. I thought I was fucking dead... that it was them... I was relieved when it was just the fucking Russians.
(shakes his head)
(MORE)
 
53.

DON (CONT'D)
What was up with that crate? Why’d they give us weapons before they started pickin’ us off? To make it more fair? And what’s with “Four legs good, too legs bad?”
(beat)
Maybe they’re fucking Vegans.

Crystal says nothing. Reaches the front of the line. A REFUGEE ladles GRUEL into her bowl. Don is next.

DON (CONT’D)
Oh I cannot wait to blow the lid
off this shit.	We’re gonna be on
Hannity.	You and me... like the
two Jews who fucked Nixon up.
(to Refugee)
A little more there, pal?

The Refugee looks taken aback by the idea of someone not taken what they’re given... but gives Don another SLOP. He follows Crystal, who hunkers down on a split stump. Eats.

DON (CONT’D)
Hey. Sweetheart -- You wanna share what you’re thinkin’?

CRYSTAL
Not really.

DON
... C’mon -- You don’t care why

they’re doing this to us?

She wipes her mouth with her sleeve.	Looks at him, evenly --

CRYSTAL
They’re trying to kill me. I don’t give a shit why.

She licks the last drops of gruel out of her bowl and throws it in the dirt as--

--	We hear the sound of TIRES on gravel. And we see the headlights of a JEEP as it drives up to the camp.

Parks outside the office trailer. There’s a FLAG sticking out of the passenger-side window. A familiar one. Stars and stripes. Red white and blue. AMERICA FUCK YEAH.

A MAN gets out of the jeep. He’s YOUNG-LOOKING, barely shaving. The unofficial uniform of a foreign diplomat -- KHAKIS, SHORT-SLEEVE BUTTON-DOWN, TIE. He looks every bit an AMERICAN ENVOY.
 
54.


DON
Well well... if it ain’t Uncle

Sam’s nephew.

He turns to Crystal, smiles with relief...

DON (CONT’D)
We’re rescued.

... She does not.

CUT TO:


INT. ENVOY’S JEEP - DRIVING - EVENING

Crystal’s in shotgun, Don in the back as the ENVOY drives them to safety. He shakes his head, clearly having received a head-spinning DOWNLOAD from his evacuees --

ENVOY
They built an entire gas station
out here... to convince you this
was Arkansas?	What kind of sick
people would even come up with
something like that?
(incredulous)
It’s just... horrifying.

DON
You fucking said it, Junior.

ENVOY
As soon as we get back to The Embassy, we’ll call The State Department and get military support out here to find these... animals. What they put you through... I can’t even imagine. Why would they do that?

DON
Same reason elites do anything.
‘Cause they think they’re better

than us.

Crystal says nothing. Just looks out the window. The Envoy furrows his brow. Trying to understand.

ENVOY
Why you, though? I mean-- it seems so personal.
 
55.


DON
... What?

ENVOY
I’m just asking... why did they pick you of all people? You must’ve done something to get on their radar... to make them target you specifically...

DON
We didn’t do shit.

ENVOY
... Are you sure?

DON
What?	You think this was our
fucking fault?

ENVOY
No... no... Of course not... I’m sorry -- The last thing I’d ever do is blame the victim. I’m just trying to understand this... I mean, the resources these people must have expended to do what you’re describing... You’d just think there would be a reason. Can you think of anything that would make them want to do something so horrible to y --

--	Crystal tilts backwards, swinging her feet up -- and
smashes them into the envoy’s face. The force of her kick sends head right through DRIVER-SIDE WINDOW of the car -- SHATTERING IT -- glass goes flying --

--	Crystal reaches over, opens the driver DOOR -- PUSHES THE ENVOY OUT OF IT --

--	The jeep skids to a stop. Crystal moves to the driver’s seat, puts the car in REVERSE. She backs up and we hear a CRUNCH as --

--	The back tire FLATTENS THE ENVOY’S SKULL.

DON
... THE FUCK?!?

Crystal puts the car in park. Takes the KEYS out of the ignition and hops out.
 
56.


EXT. ENVOY’S JEEP - CONTINUOUS

Don jumps out right behind her as Crystal crouches next to the ENVOY. His SKULL a bloody pancake. She searches his body as Don freaks out --

DON
Why’d you do that?	He was trying
to fucking SAVE us!	He --

--	Crystal pulls a GLOCK PISTOL from the Envoy’s waist band.

DON (CONT’D)
... Oh.

She checks the clip as Don reconsiders --

DON (CONT’D)
How’d you know he was lying?

CRYSTAL
Because everyone is lying.

Don contemplates that.

DON
Well... maybe you shoulda waited to kill him until he told us why they’re doing this!

CRYSTAL
Pretty sure he wanted us to tell

him why they’re doing this.

Don’s eyes light up --

DON
... Do you know why?

CRYSTAL
I know I don’t give a shit.

Now she’s moving to the back of the car. Uses the key to pop open the trunk. Don REACTS when he sees what’s inside.

A DEAD BODY.

DON
Jesus...

CRYSTAL
Nope.
(beat)

Gary.
 
57.


The last time we saw Gary, he wasn’t dead. He also didn’t have EIGHT-INCH HUNTING KNIFE stuck in his forehead. Now, though... he does. Don exhales --

DON
Guy you hopped the train with?

CRYSTAL
Uh huh.

DON
Fuck... There were ten of us when we first woke up. Three down outta the gate. Guy who got hit by the van... You said three at the gas station. One right here.
(beat)
That leaves you and me.

Crystal doesn’t care about the math. Makes no difference. Besides, she just spotted something UNDER Gary’s corpse --

A FOLDED-UP MAP.

DON (CONT’D)
... What’s that?

She pulls it out from underneath him. Unfolds it. Looks it over for a beat.

CRYSTAL
Where Mr. Bullshit was takin’ us.

She shows the map to Don.	It’s extremely literal.	“HUNTING
GROUNDS” is written at the top.	Then there’s a circled area
labeled “KILL ZONE” and another one labeled “HUNTER’S BLIND.”

Don furrows his brow, skeptical --

DON
... Seems a little obvious.	Like
maybe they wanted us to find it?

CRYSTAL
Depends on whether they’re smart pretendin’ to be idiots or they’re idiots pretendin’ to be smart.

Don doesn’t quite get that. Or maybe he does. Either way, he shakes his head --

DON
Well I say fuck those fuckers. We got a car... Let’s just fucking go.
 
58.


CRYSTAL
No.

DON
...”No?”

Crystal turns her attention back to Gary and the KNIFE stuck in his head, which she grips and begins to WIGGLE FREE --

CRYSTAL
My mama used to tell me this story ‘bout the Jackrabbit and the Box Turtle. Jackrabbit’s a real dick, brags all the time, says nobody’s faster n’ him. And it’s true. Every time he races, Jackrabbit always wins.
(beat)

The whole fucking forest has to put up with his shit day in, day out -- This fucker always wants to race just to rub it in some more, so Box Turtle figures, why not, he’ll give it a try. Jackrabbit laughs -- This’ll be fun. Let’s fuckin’ go.

--	ON CRYSTAL, wiggling the knife, CRUNCH OF SKULL AND BRAIN as she attempts to work it free --

CRYSTAL (CONT’D)
Bang.	They’re off.	Jackrabbit
leaves Box Turtle in his fucking
dust... he’s way out in front.
‘Course he is.	Jackrabbit always
wins.	But he wants to put on a
show, make it seem close, so he
stops and takes a nap.
(beat)
Well, he sleeps longer than he wanted to and when he wakes up, he knows he’s fucked... Jackrabbit goes full tilt, but it’s too late. Box Turtle crosses the finish line first. Crowd goes fucking wild.

--	SHLIK -- Crystal YANKS the knife out of Gary’s head. It’s wet with blood. She casually wipes it on her pants.
 
59.


CRYSTAL (CONT’D)
Later that night, Box Turtle’s
havin’ dinner with his family,
relivin’ his victory, tellin’ his
little Box Turtles how he did it --
Never give up, just keep crawlin’
forwards and you can overcome just
‘bout anything.
(beat)

Then the door smashes in. It’s Jackrabbit and he’s got a hammer. He smashes up the wife and kids first so Box Turtle can watch ‘em die. Then it’s his turn. Once the whole family’s broken into pieces, Jackrabbit sits down at the table and eats their dinner.
(beat)

Every last bite.

Crystal holds up the knife. Looks at Don for the first time since she started this story as she reveals its moral --

CRYSTAL (CONT’D)
Jackrabbit always wins.

Jesus.

ON DON.	A bit speechless.	Finally, he manages to ask --

DON
... Your mama told you that story?

Crystal just looks at him. HARD AS A ROCK. A rock forged by a helicopter parent of a different kind -- A helicopter that drops you off in ‘Nam and just LEAVES you there to figure out shit on your OWN. Don’s confused --

DON (CONT’D)
... Wait. So who’s the rabbit? Us or them?

Crystal shakes her head. It’s fucking OBVIOUS. But before she can answer --

--	A RUSTLING sound, coming from the BUSHES. She swivels toward it, cat-quick, KNIFE RAISED --

AS THE PIG emerges from the brush.	It STOPS.

Looks at them.	And they look at it.

Destiny steering each and every one of them TO --
 
60.


EXT. HUNTER’S BLIND - NIGHT

--	THE AFOREMENTIONED HUNTER’S BLIND.

We’re in a CAMP on a HILLTOP. There’s a row of RIFLES with heavy-duty NIGHT-VISION SCOPES, all mounted on TRIPODS and pointing down at the VALLEY below, bi-sected by a ROAD.

Hanging out near their rifles are the insidious fuckers responsible for this whole mess -- SEVEN HUNTERS --

MARTIN, DOUG, LIBERTY, DALE, RICHARD and THE DOCTOR.

We’ve met the last two before, on the plane. Three of the others are wealthy-looking MIDDLE-AGED LIBERALS. The fourth is different.

This is DALE. He’s grizzled, sports a buzzcut. He doesn’t fit in with the rest of these folks...

Because he knows what he’s DOING.

THE DOCTOR peeks through his scope --

THE DOCTOR
Where the hell is Oliver? He left to get them two hours ago.

No one answers -- They’re all sitting by their guns, simultaneously nervous and bored. Martin thumbs through Instagram on his phone --

MARTIN
That’s weird.	Susan Orlean just
liked my post.

DOUG
Do you know her?

MARTIN
No... Maybe we might have met at

the Time 100 dinner?

Martin leans over, shows Doug his phone screen --

MARTIN (CONT’D)
This was the picture she liked.

From when I was in Haiti.

DOUG
(sarcastic)

Wait.	You were in Haiti?
 
61.


MARTIN
HaHa.

DOUG
No, seriously-- it’s been almost six hours since you mentioned you were there. Remind me, what were you doing again --? Curing AIDs in a favela?

RICHARD
Don’t joke about AIDS, man.

DOUG
I’m not joking.	AIDS is serious
and Thank God Martin is single-

handedly taking it on.

MARTIN
First, there are no favelas in Haiti, asshole. That’s Brazil. So evolved of you to bust my balls for helping people.

DOUG
You built one house. That helps a person.

MARTIN
All you do, Doug, is write checks.

I like to be hands on.

DOUG
Yeah you do.

Doug raises his eyebrows.

MARTIN
... What?

DOUG
Nothing.

MARTIN
What, Doug?

DOUG
I just heard you got a girl

pregnant down there.

Liberty’s ears perk up.

LIBERTY
... Is that true?
 
62.


MARTIN
(defiant)

I fell in love.

DOUG
I hope she was pro-choice.

MARTIN
Fuck you, Doug.

The Doctor FROWNS, ignoring this, focused on his SCOPE --

THE DOCTOR
Where are they?

LIBERTY
Just call Oliver on the radio...

MARTIN
(you fucking idiot)

His radio is off because they think he’s an envoy. Jesus, Liberty -- Use your br--

--	Mid-tirade, Martin accidentally hits his rifle with his elbow -- The entire tripod comes APART --

MARTIN (CONT’D)
--	Shit. Uh... Dale? Can you, uh... help?

Dale moves towards him, FRUSTRATED, like a babysitter --

DALE
Please keep your voices down.

RICHARD
... Why?	They’re in a car.

Dale gives Richard an annoyed glance as he moves over to Martin, starts to fix the knocked-over rifle.

DALE
You hired me to consult you.	I’m
consulting you.

MARTIN
What movie did you work on again?

DALE
Tears of the Sun.
 
63.


MARTIN
Really?	It’s actually called
“Tears of the Sun?”

DALE
Yes.

MARTIN
And it came out?	In theaters?

Dale takes a deep breath.

DALE
Bruce Willis was in it.

RICHARD
... Why is the sun crying?

A SHARP VOICE FROM OFF SCREEN --

VOICE (ON LAPTOP)
Stop fucking talking.

A FEMALE VOICE. Authoritative. And FAMILIAR -- the same one we’ve been hearing on the WALKIE. Now it’s coming from a LAPTOP open on the camping table. Martin glances warily at it, answers chagrined --

MARTIN
Sorry, Athena.

Doug stands --

DOUG
I gotta go pee.
(then)

Who has the hand sanitizer?

LIBERTY
Christ, Doug... rough it.

Doug frowns, but walks off as The Doctor calls after him --

THE DOCTOR
Watch out for the trip wires!

CUT TO:


EXT. HUNTER’S BLIND - BUSHES - NIGHT

--	THE EDGE OF CAMP. It’s dark out here. Doug’s enjoying a long, satisfying piss. He hears a twig break. Turns his head -- dick still out -- and sees...
 
64.


... DON.	He is carrying the PIG in his arms.

DON
Hey... this your pig?

Doug stares. SURPRISED. Opens his mouth to CALL OUT FOR HELP WHEN --

--	Crystal POPS UP BEHIND HIM, slits his throat with a GIANT KNIFE. A HOT RUSH OF ARTERIAL BLOOD as Doug COLLAPSES, GURGLING and we SMASH BACK TO:


EXT. HUNTER’S BLIND - NIGHT

--	THE HUNTER’S BLIND. Dale’s suddenly ALERT. His senses tingling. Telling him something...

DALE
Everyone up.	Perimeter.
Like we practiced.

Martin tries to get his rifle off the tripod, fumbles -- jamming his finger.

MARTIN
Motherfucker... I can’t...

DALE
Leave the rifle.	Sidearms.	Now.

The “HUNTERS” all draw their PISTOLS as they form a circular perimeter at the edge of the camp. From the way they organize, it seems they’ve have had some training.

We go CLOSE on Martin as he peers into the darkness. Concern on his face.

MARTIN
... Doug?

DALE
Shhhh.

MARTIN
Don’t shush me!
(back to the woods)

Doug?!?

NOISES in the bushes.	Everyone points their pistols.

DALE
Easy.	They’ll hit the trips.
 
65.


Dale puts his hand up.	Tense.	In control.

Another rustle.

Dale keeps his hand up -- don’t fucking shoot.

They’re all chomping at the bit to fire. Some wouldn’t mind accidentally killing DOUG, to be hones--

-- BOOM!	A FLASH OF LIGHT AND --

The PIG comes flying through the air, landing with a THUD in the middle of camp. It’s lit on fire and SQUEALING.

BANG!-BANG!-BANG!-BANG!-BANG!-BANG!-BANG!-BANG!-BANG!-BANG!

SUDDENLY EVERYONE’S SHOOTING WILDLY AT IT.

DALE (CONT’D)
STOP!

They do.	The pig is no longer squealing.	It just sizzles.

LIBERTY
What the fuck?

THE DOCTOR
It must’ve hit one of the wires?!?

Martin glares at Richard --

MARTIN
You almost fucking shot me.

RICHARD
Well, I didn’t, did I?	‘Cause
you’re not fucking sh--

BANG!

Martin’s head explodes.

RICHARD (CONT’D)
FUCK!!!

BANG!	BANG!	BANG!

-- Crystal EMERGES from the woods, GUN UP --

--	hits Dale with three bullets in the chest and neck. She spins -- BANG!

--	Shoots Liberty, who knocks over the laptop on her way down, sends it into the dirt as --
 
66.


--	Richard SPRINTS out of the camp full tilt, but Crystal ignores him turns to The Doctor--

BANG!	BANG!	BANG!	BANG!

--	Shoots him four times in the face and neck. The whole thing is over before it started.
Crystal takes a breath. Everyone in the camp is down. But she hears GURGLING. It’s Dale. He’s still alive. And reaching for his LEG HOLSTER...

Crystal gets to it first. Disarms him of his two PISTOLS and a KNIFE. Just as SOMEONE is coming out of the forest.

Crystal whips around with her gun --

DON
Hey, hey, hey...	It’s me.

DON walks into the camp.

CRYSTAL
Thanks for all the help.

DON
I dropped the pig on the mine

thing!	Gimme a gun!

Crystal scowls... But tosses him a gun. Then she moves over to one of the mounted rifles. Looks in the SCOPE. Where --

THROUGH THE SCOPE

--	Richard.  Still running away... or attempting to.  He
stumbles, recovers, and keeps going as Crystal lines up the shot. Then she WHISTLES.

Richard turns his head back toward the sound --

BANG!

-- His neck flies apart.

One shot, one kill. But before Crystal can be too satisfied with herself --

--	LIBERTY GRABS HER. TACKLES HER TO THE GROUND. Crystal’s caught off guard. But that doesn’t really matter. It’s not a fair fight. Crystal quickly gets the KNIFE out of Liberty’s hands. Pins her to the ground. STRADDLES HER.

Don is behind Crystal, now.	She turns to him --
 
67.


CRYSTAL
Anything you wanna ask her?

DON
... What?

CRYSTAL
You got mad I killed the fucker in the car before you could ask him anything. Now’s your chance.

Don thinks.	Looks at Liberty --

DON
Why’re you doing this to us?

Liberty stares at him.	Pure venom --

LIBERTY
Because JESUS told me to.

The sarcasm is not debatable. Don frowns. Crystal cocks her gun, points it at Liberty’s head --

CRYSTAL
Well, there’s your answer.

DON
WAIT.	You can’t just -- ... She’s
a	woman.

Crystal frowns, turns to Liberty --

CRYSTAL
You think you should be afforded

mercy ‘cause you’re a girl?

Liberty processes the implications of her answer. Doesn’t want to die. But she has PRINCIPLES...

LIBERTY
... No.

BANG!

She shoots Liberty in the head.

DON
WHAT THE FUCK?!?

Don puts his hands on his head, pacing. He seems overwhelmed. And then --
 
68.


FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
Don?	Don?	... Did you get her?

It’s the same VOICE, coming from the same LAPTOP -- which is now OVERTURNED ON THE GROUND.

UH OH.	ON CRYSTAL.	She points her gun at DON.

DON
Whoa!	HEY!

FEMALE VOICE (ON LAPTOP)
Don!?!

The implication of someone on the laptop calling Don’s name is OBVIOUS --

CRYSTAL
You one of them?

DON
What?	No.

CRYSTAL
Drop the gun.	Pick it up.

Crystal gestures to the LAPTOP.	Don doesn’t budge.

DON
I’m not dropping my gun.

FEMALE VOICE (ON LAPTOP)
Don?	What’s going on?

CRYSTAL
Pick it up.

Don’s got his gun at his side, pointed down. Keeps it there as he slowly moves to the laptop. Picks it up with his other hand. The SCREEN IS BUSTED, a BULLET HOLE THROUGH IT --

DON
(to the computer)

... Who’s this?

FEMALE VOICE (ON LAPTOP) Don, you don’t have to pretend anymore. She figured it out.
(then)

Is she hurt?

Don looks confused and scared. Like he’s being tricked by this woman... or at least pretending to be. To Crystal --
 
69.


DON
I don’t know who the fuck this is.

CRYSTAL
Drop the gun.

FEMALE VOICE (ON LAPTOP)
Shoot her, Don.

DON
(to Crystal)
They’re fucking with you!	I’m on

your side!

CRYSTAL
Drop the gun.

Don’s eyes narrow -- He starts to raise his arm --

BANG!

Crystal shoots Don dead. Just fucking puts him down. Maybe because it looked like he was about to shoot HER.

Or maybe she just didn’t believe him.

Crystal moves to the laptop. The bullet hole has completely frizted it. WE CAN’T SEE who’s on the screen.

FEMALE VOICE (ON LAPTOP)
... Don?

CRYSTAL
Don’s dead.	So’s everyone else.

A beat.	Another.	Then --

FEMALE VOICE (ON LAPTOP) Then I guess you’d better come and get me.

There’s a BEEP as the woman signs off.

Crystal drops the laptop.	A GROAN.	It’s --

DALE. He’s almost dead now. But not quite. Crystal moves over to him, crouches down beside him.

CRYSTAL
Heard them call you a “consultant.”

You trained these fuckers?

She clearly heard EVERYTHING the Hunters were saying earlier. Dale’s a dead man, so why deny it --
 
70.


DALE
Yeah.

CRYSTAL
How much’d they pay you?

DALE
Nothing.

Dale gestures to the laptop.

DALE (CONT’D)
I owed her a favor.

CRYSTAL
Who?

DALE
You don’t... wanna tussle with her.

Trust me.

CRYSTAL
Where is she?

DALE
(shakes his head)
... Just go home.	You won.	Go

home.	It’s over...

Crystal PUSHES HER THUMB INTO ONE OF DALE’S BULLET WOUNDS -- HE GRUNTS IN PAIN --

CRYSTAL
Where the fuck is she?

He can see it’s pointless not to answer --

DALE
Three clicks Northeast. Dirt road. Follow it to the gate. She’ll be in her Manor.
(beat)

Waiting.

Crystal nods.	Satisfied.	Dale sizes her up --

DALE (CONT’D)
Were you in the service?

CRYSTAL
Afghanistan.
(then)

You?
 
71.


DALE
National Guard.

CRYSTAL
So you were never in the shit.

DALE
Nope...

Dale offers a final noble smile --

DALE (CONT’D)
... But I’m in it now.

Crystal nods. He surely is. Then, without hesitation, she puts her gun in his face. And the ensuing BANG! CUTS US TO:

EXT. WOODS - SOMEWHERE

... A DIRT ROAD winding through the woods. Crystal walks down it. Following Dale’s directions.


EXT. CLEARING

She breaks from the woods -- spots in the DISTANCE --

A GORGEOUS HOME.

Not a dilapidated old mansion as we might expect. It’s a beautiful Nancy Meyers house. Crystal heads towards it, looks off to the RIGHT --

THERE’S AN AIRSTRIP.

A PRIVATE JET is parked at the end of it, like a car in the driveway. Except a jet. On an airstrip.

Crystal keeps walking. Notices a “BEWARE OF DOG” sign -- fearsome silhouette of a ROTTWEILER on it.

She finally reaches the front porch.	Walks up the steps.
There’s an INTERCOM DOORBELL.	She presses it.

DING DONG.	A beat.	Then, a matter-of-fact FEMALE VOICE --

FEMALE VOICE (OVER INTERCOM)
Put your gun in the mailbox.

CRYSTAL
Why the fuck would I do that?
 
72.


FEMALE VOICE (OVER INTERCOM) There’s a shaped C4 charge underneath the porch. I could blow you up right now... but where’s the fun in that?
(then; forceful)

Gun.	Mailbox.	Now.

Crystal’s eyes narrow. She looks down at her feet on the porch. Imagines what’s beneath them. Not much of a choice.

She pops the clip out of her pistol and clears the chamber.
Then she opens the mailbox and puts the gun and clip in.

BZZZZZZZZZZZ. A magnetic lock. Crystal reaches for the front door handle. Pushes it open. ENTERS as we --

MATCH CUT TO:


INT. OFFICE - DAY

--	A well-appointed WOMAN entering a well-appointed corporate OFFICE. We are BEHIND this woman and will be for the entire scene, PULP FICTION STYLE.

Her hair is pulled up in a tight bun and even though we can’t see her face, we know instantly that it isn’t Crystal.

No.	This is ATHENA.

This is another time.	Another place.

A man is standing waiting for her. This is PAUL. He wears wire-rimmed glasses, a crisp white shirt and (ironed) JEANS because when you’re a fucking billionaire, you can do that. He smiles --

PAUL
Athena... Hi, shut the door. Have a seat.

He gestures to the couch across a coffee table, upon which sit never-opened Taschen Books featuring photographs of the Civil Rights Movement.

ATHENA
What’s she doing here?

“She” is CLARISSA, dressed like a lawyer. Because she’s a lawyer. She sits in a chair beside the couch. Unlike Paul, she is not smiling.
 
73.


PAUL
Please.	Sit.

Athena hesitates. We still can’t see her face (nor will we, at least not HERE), but eventually...

She SITS.

PAUL (CONT’D)
I assume you heard that Martin was hacked last week?

A beat.

ATHENA
I’m the CEO of this company.	Of
course I heard.

PAUL
It was very embarrassing for him.
(frowns)

The sexual improprieties.

ATHENA
Is that what you call them? Because I heard he sent his wife’s oncologist photos of his cock.

Paul drops his eyes uncomfortably.	Clarissa is unflinching.

PAUL
Athena...	This is serious.

ATHENA
Of course it is.	Clarissa only
shows up when it’s serious.

PAUL
It’s not just the sexual im--
(fuck it; moving on)

Martin also said some very critical things about the president.

Athena’s posture changes.	TIGHTENS.

ATHENA
Last I heard free speech still

exists, Paul.

PAUL
(exasperated)
Don’t... First Amendment me, okay?

(MORE)
 
74.

PAUL (CONT'D)
This isn’t a country, it’s a
corporation... there are optics!

Fucking optics, Athena!

A beat.	Athena does the math.

ATHENA
You fired Martin.

PAUL
He gave his resignation to the

Board, yes.

ATHENA
Because you asked him to?

PAUL
Because he fucked up.

Athena’s head cocks as she registers the same thing we do --
Clarissa has been playing with a RED FOLDER on her lap.

Playing with it like a loaded gun she cannot WAIT to fire.

ATHENA
What’s in the file, Clarissa?

Paul sighs.

PAUL
Do you recall a text thread you had with Martin, Richard, Doug, Liberty, and others in December of ‘17 at about two in the morning?

ATHENA
I don’t recall text threads from last fucking Tuesday, Paul. Why? Did I say something critical about the president?

She’s losing it.

She knows she’s losing it.

PAUL
Clarissa.

Paul nods to Clarissa, who (not without glee) opens the red folder and reads aloud, monotone, matter-of-fact, a somewhat familiar series of TEXTS --

CLARISSA
Martin.	“Did anyone see what our
ratfucker-in-chief just did?

(MORE)
 
75.

CLARISSA (CONT'D)
Liberty. “Don’t wanna know.” Athena. “At least the hunt’s coming up. Nothing better than going out to The Manor and slaughtering a dozen inbred rednecks. Oliver. “Hah!” Richard. Miranda. “We promised not to talk about ‘the manor’ on text!” Ted. “Viva El Manor!” Liberty. “DELETING THIS THREAD!!!”

Clarissa closes the folder.	And her case.

Athena sits there for a moment.

ATHENA
I don’t get it.

PAUL
Are you aware that there is now an active group of people who believe this is a real thing?

ATHENA
... Believe what’s a real thing?

PAUL
That you’re hunting human beings.
(then)
Annually.
(then)

For sport.

A beat.	And then?

Athena LAUGHS.	She laughs for a good ten seconds.

Paul and Clarissa do not.

ATHENA
Wait... hold on... What?

PAUL
The conspiracy websites are all over it. The message boards on...
(to Clarissa)

What is it, Redder...?	Redthat?

CLARISSA
Reddit.
 
76.


PAUL
Reddit.	They’re going berzerk.
Some asshole pulled the property
tax records for a Manor House you

own in Vermont.

ATHENA
A...	Manor?	No, Paul.	I do not
own a fucking MANOR in Vermont.

PAUL
You shouldn’t have used that word.

ATHENA
“Manor?”

PAUL
(uncomfortable)

No.	The “R” word.

ATHENA
What the fuck is the “R” word?!?

PAUL
(doesn’t wanna say it)

Clarissa?

ON CLARISSA. She doesn’t want to say it either. But finally, she whispers --

CLARISSA
Redneck.

ATHENA
“REDNECK?!?”

PAUL
... Athena...

ATHENA
... It’s the “R” word now? I mean, I know I’m not allowed to say “fat” anymore, but I didn’t get the fucking email that I can’t say fucking “redneck” --

PAUL
-- Athena, please --

ATHENA
--	What would you prefer I call them, Paul? “Gun Clutchers?” “Academically Challenged?” “Tooth Deprived?”
 
77.


PAUL
Enough!

Paul takes off his glasses, pinches the bridge of his nose as he shakes his head --

PAUL (CONT’D)
This is out there.	This is
happening.	We’ve got our best team
in reputation management flooding
the search engines so it doesn’t go
mainstream.	But even if by some
miracle it doesn’t...
(beat)
These people aren’t going away.
They believe this.
(shakes his head)
Martin did what he had to. Richard is out at BlueWest... Miranda and Ted stepped down from their foundations and Liberty exited her fund. I’m so sorry, Athena... I really am...

He leans in.	Not without empathy --

PAUL (CONT’D)
But you have to go.

Athena calms. A death row inmate seated in the electric chair, knowing the switch is about to be thrown. It’s a little eerie hearing the distance in her voice.

One could later argue it’s the moment she became a sociopath.

She just has one question...

ATHENA
What people?

PAUL
... Sorry?

ATHENA
What people believe that I’m hunting human beings. At my Manor.

Paul and Clarissa don’t have an answer. And so, Athena asks again, AT THE TOP OF HER FUCKING VOICE --

ATHENA (CONT’D)
WHAT FUCKING PEOPLE?!?!?!?!

SMASH TO:
 
78.


INT. FOYER - THE MANOR - MORNING

CRYSTAL.

That’s what fucking people.

As she enters the foyer, Crystal hears SOFT ROCK playing deeper in the house. It sounds like fucking VAN MORRISON...

She ALSO hears the JINGLE of a DOG COLLAR -- braces herself -- mind flashing to the “BEWARE OF DOG” sign outside -- but this isn’t a fearsome Rottweiler...

... It’s an beautiful IRISH SETTER. Shaggy red hair shimmering as it bounds up to Crystal, licks her hand.

Crystal leaves the dog, follows the VAN MORRISON into...


INT. MANOR - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

... THE LIVING ROOM. Have we mentioned that this house is unbelievably beautiful?

It’s unbelievably beautiful.

Every VINTAGE SCONCE and CASHMERE THROW has been hand-selected with impeccable taste. And probably cost a lot more than Crystal’s car. If she even has a car.

A LARGE GEORGIA O’KEEFE has been taken off the wall. The pink flower petals bearing more than passing resemblance to the female sex organ... But that’s neither here nor there.

In the empty space where the painting was, someone has tacked up ELEVEN PHOTOS. ELEVEN FACES. ELEVEN people who were brought here to be HUNTED. RANDY from the Plane. DAISY. TRUCKER HAT. FRECKLES. BUDWEISER. KID ROCK. HAIRLINE. LUMBERJANE. GARY. DON.

All PREY.

There are X’s over ten of them.

All except CRYSTAL’S.

She stands there, taking this in. Her eyes lingering on her own unsmiling mug.

Then she keeps moving. Van Morrison getting louder, now. As she walks into...
 
79.


INT. KITCHEN - THE MANOR - DAY

... THE KITCHEN. There’s a bottle of CHAMPAGNE chilling in an ice bucket. But don’t notice that, because we’re focused on the WOMAN standing at the KITCHEN COUNTER.

Her back is turned toward us.	We still can’t see her face.
But by now, we know who this woman is...

ATHENA
It’s amazing to me. People go their whole lives without realizing the most simple, obvious truth...

... Athena’s doing something with a long, serrated knife.

ATHENA (CONT’D)
... The only way to properly slice tomatoes is with a bread knife.

She keeps slicing, her back still to Crystal. It’s pretentious and dismissive and all about POWER.

ATHENA (CONT’D)
You killed Don?

CRYSTAL
Uh huh.

ATHENA
Because I convinced you he was one of us?

CRYSTAL
Was he?

ATHENA
Maybe.
(then)

Maybe not.

With that, Athena puts the knife down. Picks up a plate and turns around.

For the first time, we get to see her.	She is beautiful.
She would also find that description sexist.

And rightly so. Because it neglects to mention her intimidating intellect and preternatural composure. As well as her EYES. Imagine if Gwyneth Paltrow was not the magnate of the Goop empire, but instead, the most dangerous woman in the world. For when ATHENA MALONE stares at you, it’s like that nightmare where you’re naked at your High School dance.
 
80.


Athena locks in on Crystal. At the same time dressing her tomatoes -- drizzle of oil, sprinkle of salt. She never looks down. Just holds the gaze. Crystal stares right back.

ATHENA (CONT’D)
Who am I?

CRYSTAL
... Huh?

ATHENA
Who.	Am.	I.

CRYSTAL
Beats me.

Athena is clearly ANNOYED.

ATHENA
The name Athena Malone doesn’t ring a bell?

CRYSTAL
Lady, I don’t know who you are.
(beat)

So who am I?

A beat.

ATHENA
Crystal May Creasey. Born 1974 in Mississippi. “Whites Crossing”... Fitting.
(beat)

Dropped out of high school at 14. Right around the time your father was killed by the police when they raided a methamphetamine lab he was working in.
(then)
Your mother joined him soon after that. Overdose. Probably the last batch of his stuff. Romantic.

Athena eyes track every micro-movement on Crystal’s face.
Searching for a sign of weakness.	She doesn’t find one.

So she turns to the stovetop behind her -- flips the SANDWICH she’s making.
 
81.


ATHENA (CONT’D)
Most people say you should use
cheddar in a grilled cheese, but I
use gruyere.	Nothing else has that

kind of melt.

Oh brother. Crystal tries to keep her eyes from rolling out of her skull. The grilled cheese sizzles as Athena turns back to Crystal and continues --

ATHENA (CONT’D)
After your mom died, you bounced from part-time job to part-time job to welfare, and back. More times than I could count, honestly. The only consistency was your inability to stay employed.
(beat)
That would have been fine. Our country belongs to the uneducated and ignorant just as much as it belongs to me. You fail, we pay. Eventually, a cow falls on you or you blow your brains out in a parking lot because you finally understood what a waste your life truly was. But not you, Crystal...
(beat)

You decided to go on the internet and run your stupid fucking mouth.

Athena picks up a SHEET OF PAPER (the stock is exquisite) from the counter --

ATHENA (CONT’D)
Thirteen months ago, you posted

this in a comments section --

Crystal’s face is neutral. Just fucking watching as Athena reaches into her pocket for READING GLASSES.

ATHENA (CONT’D)
I want to make sure I get it
exactly right.
(reading)

“Fuck this bitch. Athena Malone murders innocent men and women for sport. The evidence is all their.
(beat; condescending)
T-H-E-I-R.
(continuing)
Her Manor, her travel records...

(MORE)
 
82.

ATHENA (CONT’D)
Oh, and in case you were still on the fence: she fucking ADMITTED to it in a text message.”

Athena places the paper back down on the counter.

ATHENA (CONT’D)
“Admitted” was all-caps.

CRYSTAL
Huh.

ATHENA
“Huh?” That’s all you have to say for yourself?

CRYSTAL
No.	I’m just confused.

ATHENA
Confused about what?

CRYSTAL
Everybody you kidnapped... and killed... it’s ‘cause they busted you and your friends and put it on the internet?

ATHENA
No one busted us.	They... you...
made it all up!

CRYSTAL
Made... what up?

ATHENA
It was just a joke. An obvious joke. But you ignorami took it literally because nuance and appreciation for satire were bred out when you people started fucking your cousins! I am worth hundreds of millions. I have a doctorate. I’ve chained myself to redwoods and nursed orphans in Zaire! What kind of fucking simpleton would actually believe that I WOULD FUCKING HUNT HUMAN FUCKING BEINGS FOR SPORT?!?

She’s SCREAMING now.	Crystal remains totally chill.

CRYSTAL
But you are.
 
83.


ATHENA
What?

CRYSTAL
Hunting human beings for sport.

ATHENA
No...

CRYSTAL
... Yes.

ATHENA
NO.	It was a lie.

Crystal looks around, takes in the space --

CRYSTAL
This is your manor, isn’t it?

ATHENA
It’s not a fucking -- manor. It’s a house. A house in fucking Croatia that I fucking rented and had decorated!

CRYSTAL
Right. But it’s yours. And you’re hunting people.
(shrugs)

So it’s true.

Athena’s losing it. This is the worst imaginable version of WHO’S ON FIRST and she does NOT want to play --

ATHENA
Now it is. Now. Because you made it true. Your fucking lies cost me everything and the other fucking trolls believed them and spread them and nothing I said would convince you it was bullshit... so why not just do it?!? This was your idea. Not mine.

Crystal just looks at her.

CRYSTAL
Well... not my idea.

ATHENA
... What?
 
84.


CRYSTAL
I didn’t wanna mess up your big grilled cheese speech, but you done fucked up, lady.
(beat)

You got the wrong Crystal.

Wait.	HOLD ON.

CRYSTAL (CONT’D)
There’s another Crystal Mae Creasey back home. She spells the Mae with an “e.” I get her mail sometimes.

WHOA.	Athena shakes her head, confused... not processing...

ATHENA
Bullshit.

CRYSTAL
My dad’s an asshole, but he never did drugs. My mom’s still alive, too -- We can call her right now if you want.

Athena shakes her head -- No.	No WAY.

ATHENA
You’re lying.

CRYSTAL
Maybe.
(a small smile)

Maybe not.

TOUCHE.	Athena’s eyes narrow.	Crystal just sighs --

CRYSTAL (CONT’D)
So do I have to keep listening to Van Morrison or can we fucking get on with it?

Athena’s eyes narrow.	Her body tightens.

... And so, they get ON with it.

Both women LUNGE for the BREAD KNIFE.

And we'll block out every detail of this gigantic, John-Wick-style fight scene. But for the purposes of this draft, let’s boil it down to essentials:

Crystal and Athena couldn't have more different fighting styles. One’s well-trained and precise and agile.
 
85.


The other’s tough and bites and scratches and plays dirty.

Despite that, these women couldn’t be more evenly-matched.

Its starts as a knife fight. They slash at each other like sword fighters... until Athena knocks the blade out of Crystal’s hand -- and Crystal BASHES HER WITH THE HOT GRILLED CHEESE SKILLET --

--	And now they’re into the pots and pans. Going through enough COOKWARE for a 14-course meal -- Which means that they soon start using blow-torches and meat thermometers and porcelain flour jars. Anything they can get their hands on and use to beat the shit out of each other.

... When the powdered sugar clears, the fight ends like all good fights do...

... IN HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT.

Both women are covered in blood. Each having taken heavy damage. Athena glimpses an opening. Fakes a punch toward’s Crystal’s stomach, then slams upward with a KARATE CHOP -- hitting Crystal square in the fucking neck.

Crystal crumples. Gargling blood. But as she falls, she grabs Athena's leg -- pulls her down with her. The two go tumbling across the floor, locked in a wrestling match.

Crystal ends up on top. Pins both of Athena's arms down. And holds them there with her left hand as she starts to pummel Athena with her right.

Over, and over, and over she bludgeons Athena’s face. Going for the fucking KILL now. Athena’s flickering.

But then -- somehow -- she summons a final burst of strength -
-	slips her hands behind Crystal's head and yanks down -- cracking Crystal's forehead into her knee. HARD.

Crystal falls back, stunned. Athena reaches -- grabs a knife off the floor... And drives it into Crystal's chest.

Fuck.

Crystal falls backward into the cabinets. Athena scrambles forward, straddling her. Grabs the knife in Crystal’s chest with two hands. Readying for a final death twist --

--	But Crystal grabs the knife too. Now they’re in a deadlock. Both pairs of arms tense and quivering with exertion --
 
86.


--	Crystal’s just a little bit stronger.  Despite Athena's
entire weight on top of her, she starts pulling the knife out of her chest. Finally wrenches it free. Then she turns the blade around...

... And buries it Athena’s heart.

Athena slumps back against a counter.

She’s done fighting.

Both women are. Each slumped back against their respective cabinets. Facing each other as they bleed out.

And this is how our story is going to end. With these two mortal enemies dying here, in a fucking Nancy Meyers kitchen.

The Van Morrison is still playing.

Crystal looks at Athena.

CRYSTAL (CONT’D)
Why Snowball?

ATHENA
... What?

CRYSTAL
Why’d you call me “Snowball?”

Athena spits out a mouthful of blood.	Then --

ATHENA
It’s a reference to George Orwell’s “Animal Farm.” He’s... a pig.

CRYSTAL
Yeah... But why am I Snowball?
Snowball’s an idealist.	He wants
to make the world a better place.
(beat)
That’s why the other pigs make up
lies about him.	To turn him into
the enemy.
(beat)

You should be Snowball.

Athena takes this in.	Feeling a lot of different things.
But one more than anything else:

For someone who prided herself on knowing just about everything, it seems only fitting that she dies SURPRISED --
 
87.


ATHENA
You’ve... read... Animal Farm...?

Athena collapses backward.	Eyes rolling up in her head.

And she’s GONE.

Crystal takes ragged gasp of air. She’s just as hurt as Athena was. Which means she’s about to die, too.

But instead of doing that, she stands up. Staggers over to the kitchen counter and grabs a handful of towels. Ties them together end-to-end. Then she ties the whole thing around her blood-soaked chest.

The Van Morrison’s still playing. Crystal moves to the kitchen SPEAKER. It’s one of those modern things with no fucking buttons.

She opens the drawer below it. Finds an IPAD. Next to a pack of American Spirits. Crystal grabs the IPAD and scrolls through. Picks a song. Then she puts it back and grabs the cigarettes.

The Etta James version of “Take It To The Limit” begins to play (you thought it’d be some country shit, didn’t you?).

Crystal lights the cigarette and takes a long drag. The song continues as we UPCUT TO:


INT. BATHROOM - THE MANOR - DAY

A few minutes later. Crystal’s in the bathroom. Watching herself in the mirror as she unwraps the makeshift tourniquet.

Her wound is still bleeding pretty badly. Crystal takes a bottle of rubbing alcohol and pours it over the cut. Winces in pain.

Then she picks up a BLOWTORCH. The type of thing you use to make creme brûlée.

She takes a deep breath.	Turns it on.


INT. SHOWER - BATHROOM - THE MANOR - DAY

Crystal showers. Washing blood off the now-cauterized wound on her chest.
 
88.


INT. ATHENA’S CLOSET - THE MANOR - DAY

Crystal flicks on the light in Athena’s closet. Rows and rows of fancy suits and dresses and high heels.


INT. ATHENA’S BEDROOM - THE MANOR - DAY

Crystal dresses herself in the least fancy thing she could find. Still...

It’s extremely fancy.

When she’s done, she looks in the mirror. We don’t see the outfit. Just her reaction to it.


EXT. FRONT PORCH - THE MANOR - DAY

Crystal walks out on the porch.	Etta James still playing.
She blinks.	Puts on a pair of Athena’s sunglasses.

And now we get to see her whole look. The clothes she borrowed fit fucking perfectly. And standing there, dressed to the nines, Irish Setter by her side... Crystal looks like a different person.

She opens the mailbox.	Puts the clip back in her pistol.
Chambers the bullet.

She looks at Athena’s PLANE on the tarmac.	But doesn’t move.
Something making her hesitate as we CUT BACK TO:


INT. KITCHEN - THE MANOR - DAY

THE BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE. 1907 Heidsiek & Co. It was knocked down during the melee. But it’s not broken. Just lying there on the floor with melting ice cubes all around it.

A HAND reaches in and grabs it.


EXT. MANOR - AIRSTRIP - DAY

Crystal walks up to Athena’s private jet -- gun in one hand, champagne in the other. The Irish Setter at her heels as she walks up the steps and enters --


INT. MAIN CABIN - PRIVATE JET - DAY

--	THE MAIN CABIN of the plane. Where the FLIGHT ATTENDANT and the PILOT were just flirting. They turn, see Crystal --
 
89.


FLIGHT ATTENDANT
--	Oh shit.

They see her GUN.

CRYSTAL
Hey there.	The assholes you work
for tried to kill me... but I
killed them instead and now I’d
really like to go home.
(beat)

... That gonna be a problem?

The Pilot and Flight Attendant quickly accept the New World Order and their place in it --

PILOT
Certainly not, ma’am.

He nods and heads for the cockpit. The Flight Attendant looks at Crystal uncomfortably... then nods to the CHAMPAGNE bottle in her hand --

FLIGHT ATTENDANT
May I pour that for you?


EXT. MANOR - AIRSTRIP - DAY

--	We get a last look at the MANOR as the jet barrels down the runway, engines roaring...

... AND TAKES OFF INTO THE SKY.


INT. MAIN CABIN - PRIVATE JET - IN FLIGHT

The flight attendant fills Crystal’s glass with champagne.

FLIGHT ATTENDANT
How about a snack?	We have some
fantastic caviar.	It’s Ossetra,
fresh fr--

CRYSTAL
-- Yeah.

FLIGHT ATTENDANT
You got it.

The flight attendant smiles uncomfortably, disappears to the galley where she will most likely pray for her life.

In the meantime, Crystal takes a sip of champagne...
 
90.


Reaches down and adjusts the recliner on her seat. Finds a comfortable position and settles in, satisfied.

The flight attendant returns with the CAVIAR. It sits in a small jar amidst a spread of blinis and little silver bowls with accoutrements.

She sets it all down on a table in front of Crystal.

Crystal doesn’t quite know what to do, but doesn’t give a shit. Picks up a blini and dunks it into the caviar like a nacho, scoops up the delicate black eggs until it’s HEAPING --

Then pops it into her mouth.	And CHEWS...

FLIGHT ATTENDANT (CONT’D)
... How is it?

Crystal washes the bite down with a CHUG of champagne.

We do not know if she is Crystal Mae Creasey or Crystal MAY Creasey. It doesn’t really matter. What we DO know?

Is that she is most certainly not “Snowball.”

No.

She is the JACKRABBIT.

And the Jackrabbit always wins.

Crystal wipes her mouth with the back of her hand.	Swallows.

She looks up at the flight attendant. And for the very first time, allows herself a genuine, satisfied smile --

CRYSTAL
It’s fucking great.
