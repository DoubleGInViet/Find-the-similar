FADE IN:


EXT. PROSPECT PARK - BROOKLYN - AN EARLY SPRING MORNING

An eclectic Group ranging in age from 30 to 80 gather in rows performing the ancient Chinese martial art of TAI CHI. They are led by their young and graceful Instructor. CAMERA GLIDES PAST one student to the next, as they move in sync through their meditative poses. CREDITS BEGIN.

BEN (V.O.)
Freud said, “Love and work, work
and love.	That’s all there is.”
Well, I’m retired and my wife is

dead.

And on that, we ARRIVE on BEN WHITTAKER. Ben just turned Seventy, an Everyman in many ways, but a unique man to all who know him. He exhales as he turns in sync with the others.

BEN (V.O.)
--	As you can imagine, that has given me some time on my hands.

INT. BEN’S HOUSE - BROOKLYN - NIGHT

BEN, wearing a suit and tie, sits in an upright chair in his comfortable brownstone, TALKING TO CAMERA. Looks like he’s on VIDEO.

BEN
My wife’s been gone for three-and-a-half years. I miss her in every way. And retirement -- that is an ongoing, relentless effort in creativity. At first, I admit, I enjoyed the novelty of it. Sort of felt like I was playing hooky.

EXT. JFK TARMAC - NEW YORK CITY - DAY

A jumbo jet lifts off.

BEN V.O.
I used all the miles I had saved
and traveled the globe.
 
2.


INT. BEN’S BROWNSTONE - BROOKLYN - NIGHT

Ben ENTERS in an overcoat, carrying his suitcase and wearing a purple lei around his neck. He stands for a moment in his quiet, empty house.

BEN V.O.
Problem was, no matter where I
went, as soon as I got home, the
nowhere to be thing hit me like a

ton of bricks.


EXT. BROOKLYN STREET - MORNING RUSH HOUR - WINTER

It’s noisy. Ben walks among the crowd, paper under his arm.

BEN V.O.
I realized the key to this whole
deal was to keep moving.	Get up,
get out of the house and go

somewhere. Anywhere.


INT. PARK SLOPE STARBUCKS - MORNING

Crowded with folks on their way to work. Ben sits on a stool at a corner table with a bagel and the morning’s Post.

BEN V.O.
Come rain or shine, I’m at my
Starbucks by 7:15.	Can’t explain
it, but it makes me feel part of

something.

Two Male Execs in their 40’s, ask Ben if they can share his table. Ben’s delighted, moves his papers. The Guys take the two remaining stools, turn them away from Ben and begin an impromptu meeting -- as if Ben wasn’t even there.

INT. BEN’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Ben to CAMERA.

BEN
How do I spend the rest of my days? You name it. Golf, movies, books, pinochle, tried yoga, learned to cook, bought some plants, took classes in Mandarin.
(SPEAKS MANDARIN)
Translation? Believe me, I’ve tried everything.
 
3.


INT. FUNERAL HOME - DAY

Ben walks the center aisle between the pews. Many of his friends sit around him. He pats a back or two as he looks for an empty seat.

BEN V.O.
And then of course, there are the funerals. So many more than I could imagine.

As Ben looks for a seat, a cute number about Ben’s age, PATTY POMERANTZ, smiles at him, hoping he’ll sit next to her. Just then, Ben spots his friend, MILES, who shows him he saved him a seat. Ben smiles back at Patty but joins Miles, who shakes his head at their deceased friend, lying before them. Ben looks at his friend, tears quickly welling in his eyes.

CLOSE - AN OPEN SUITCASE

On Ben’s BED. Ben places TWO GIFTS wrapped in Toy Store wrapping paper on top of his clothes, zips his bag shut.

BEN (V.O)
The only traveling I do these days is out to San Diego to visit my son and his family.

A CHILD’S BEDROOM CEILING - NIGHT

The ceiling is filled with stars that glisten in the dark.
CAMERA TILTS DOWN past them.

BEN V.O.
They’re all so great, I love ‘em to pieces, but to be honest, I think I’ve probably relied on them way more than I should.

We arrive on a LITTLE GIRL ASLEEP in the top bunk of a bunk-bed. As CAMERA CONTINUES TO BOOM DOWN we find Ben wide awake in the bottom bunk under Dora the Explorer sheets.

BEN (V.O)
Don’t get me wrong. I’m not an unhappy person. Quite the contrary. I just know there’s a hole in my life and I need to fill it.

Ben TURNS TOWARD CAMERA, turns out a small lamp and the SCREEN goes BLACK.

BEN (V.O.)
Soon.
 
4.


EXT. MARKET - BROOKLYN - DAY

Ben EXITS carrying groceries, just about passing by the market’s colorful Bulletin Board.

BEN (V.O.)
Which brings me to this morning, when I was leaving Trader Joe’s and caught your flyer out of the corner of my eye.

CAMERA WHIPS to a flyer -- Senior Internship Program at ClothesThatFit.com. OVER Ben’s V.O. reads: Seniors -- Be an Intern!
We Need Your Experience and We’ll Teach You What We Know! Apply Today!

ON BEN. Amused and intrigued. As he reaches for the flyer --

PATTY (O.S.)
I thought that was you!

Ben turns to find Patty, the woman from the Funeral.

PATTY (cont’d)
What’d you find?
(reads for herself)
Senior Internship Program at... How do you pronounce this? I hate when they don’t put spaces between the words.

BEN
ClothesThatFit.com. I think an
internet place is looking for
Senior Interns. Am I reading that

right?

PATTY
Lemme see.
(skims the Flyer)
You have to be over 65, have organizational skills, genuine interest in e-commerce, whatever that is, and a roll up your sleeves attitude. Well, that’s you to a T, kid.

BEN
ClothesThatFit... Is that the
outfit that took over the--

PATTY
Yeah, I think they bought one of the factories on Front Street. My daughter tells me they sell clothes on the web. How that works, I have no idea.
 
5.


Ben tears off the Flyer, then seems thrown.

BEN
Oh. You have to upload the
application. That could be
challenging. Listen to this.
(reads)

Cover letters are so old fashioned. (they both react, Ben continues reading)

So show us who you are with a cover letter video.
(Patty’s confused, Ben
reads)
Upload your video to youtube or
vimeo using .mov, .avi or an .mpg
file. We look forward to meeting
you.
(amused)

Okay. I guess that’s meeting me.

PATTY
I swear, I don’t even know what
language that was. What are you
doin’ tonight Ben?
(peeks in his grocery bag)
Frozen Lasagne... I could make a
little salad and turn that into
dinner for two.
(confidentially)

Like we did that time but never did again. That was five months ago, you know.

BEN
(sweetly)
Was it? Yeah, no, we should do that again for sure but okay by you if I take a rain check?

PATTY
You’re cute you know that?

BEN
No, I didn’t...

Ben bends down to kiss Patty on the cheek. She takes his face and kisses him on the lips.

PATTY
Don’t wait too long, doll. We’re
not gettin’ any younger.


INT. BEN’S KITCHEN - THAT NIGHT

Ben washes his dinner plate, puts it in the empty dish rack.
Then washes a single glass, puts that in the dish rack.
 
6.


1 A.M. - BEN CAN’T SLEEP

He stares at the ceiling, then impulsively tosses off the covers.

A MOTORIZED TIE RACK SWINGS into action. Ben decisively selects a tie.

IN THE BATHROOM, now wearing a crisp suit and tie, Ben combs his hair. Looks at himself, knows what he has to do.

BEN (V.O.)
So -- here I am...


INT. BEN’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

An old model Camcorder is perched on a table, it’s red RECORD light ON. CAMERA circles behind the Camcorder until it finds what it’s shooting -- BEN, in his suit and tie.

BEN
--	applying to be one of your
interns because the more I think about this idea, the more tremendous I think it is. I have a ton of knowledge I can share. Love the idea of having a place I can go every day. I want the connection, the excitement, I want to be challenged and I guess I might even want to be needed. The tech stuff might take a bit to figure out, I had to call my nine year old grandson just to find out what a USB connector was...but I’ll get there. Eager to learn. Also, want you to know, I’ve been a company man all my life. I’m loyal, I’m trustworthy and I’m good in a crisis. I read once, musicians don’t retire. They stop when there’s no more music in them. Well, I still have music in me. Absolutely positive about that.


INT. THE FANTASTIC OFFICES OF CLOTHESTHATFIT.COM - DAY

A former factory retrofitted as an enormous bullpen. It’s a football field of cubicles buzzing like a trading floor.

Some have described it as organized chaos -- it’s a young company growing at hyper-speed. The surroundings are not fancy but there’s a coolness factor here that can’t be denied. It’s a start up that’s taken off.
 
7.


Everyone working here is either young or really young. Cute, fashion-y women and sweatshirt-clad engineers.

CAMERA quickly moves past cubicles, ENTERING the very swamped CUSTOMER SERVICE area, where 25 Young Men and Women wear headsets and chat to their Customers. As we pass by, we HEAR:

”Good news, I found a size 8 in navy!” “You’re right, it should have arrived by now, let me track that for you.” “Yep, these pants are awesome if you have hips. Super slimming.” “Yes, we are called ClothesThatFit and I’m very sorry the dress didn’t fit... Sir.”

We arrive at the last cubicle where JULES OSTIN is mid-call. Jules has been “leaning in” since pre-school -- hard-wired to be something, to do something. She prides herself in not wanting to be stereotyped. Her strongest attribute is her very big brain, which unfortunately for those around her, never shuts down. Ever.

JULES
(into headset)
Okay, let me just review this with you. You have six bridesmaids and you bought six of the silk chiffon Antoinette dresses, in pink. The wedding is in three days and the dresses arrived this morning -- all in charcoal gray.
(a co-worker overhears,
mouth agape)
--	which we don’t even sell, so
that’s a bit of a mystery. Rachel, please don’t cry, you have to look fresh for your wedding. Really, let me cry ‘cause this is entirely our fault. So, okay, here’s what we’re going to do. I’m going to call the vendor and get this fixed today, I will personally see the dresses myself before they are Fed Exed and they will be at your front door by 10 a.m. on Friday. Let me give you my cell just in case...

Ready? 917-582-4848. (Others around her take note of this)
Okay? --Well, you’re starting to sound a little better already. Thank you so much for your patience. Oh! I’m also going to refund you back 50% on each dress. It’s the least we can do. No -- thank you! So check this one off your list, this is done! And Rachel, have a great wedding!

(hangs up)
OhmyGod, how did that happen?
 
8.


Jules looks up and sees her perennially overwrought YOUNG ASSISTANT, BECKY -- just out of college and a little nervous around Jules. Becky is an incredibly hard worker but unfortunately has no ability to prioritize or organize.

JULES (cont’d)
(rises )
I know, I’m late for something.

BECKY
Yeah. Everything.

JULES
But you see why I take customer
service calls?	This is so good.
Learn so much. What’s up? What’s

going on?

As Becky reads from a Post-It, Jules climbs onto a nearby bike, starts to peddle through the office. Becky tries to keep up, talks fast.

BECKY
Okay. Candice was waiting for you but had another meeting, she said she’ll be back at Two. Your 11:00 is in the conference room, so is your 11:10, finance needs you and I guess you e-mailed a bunch of people at 4 a.m. about something?

JULES
--	Oh, good! I forgot about that. I want to figure out a way for girlfriends to shop together on line...make it less of an alone thing. E-mail me that idea, will ya?

BECKY
Yeah, I like that.
(writing quickly, takes
out Phone)
Is now a good time to call your

Mother back?

JULES
(What?)
Dude, I’m on a bike...

A small Group sings Happy Birthday to a co-worker. They hope Jules will stop by but she just waves instead as she pedals past.

Jules passes by an EMPTY CUBICLE which everyone uses to store their crap. It’s filled with files, shoe boxes, hangers, computer cords. An eye sore. Jules squints at the mess as she rides by.
 
9.


JULES LANDS IN HER CHAIR - AT HER DESK

Near the FRONT OF THE ROOM. On her desk is a ridiculous stack of work, a computer with two monitors, a laptop and a sign that says “FOCUS”.

JULES (cont’d)
(without looking up)
Becky...
(Becky arrives out of
breath.)

Can you patch me in. You okay?

Becky nods, hits a few keys on her phone, nods to Jules.

JULES (cont’d)
(picks up her phone, then
OVER THE P.A.)
I need creative and marketing... and the buying and merchandizing teams for the silk chiffon Antoinette dress. Oh! Also... Just did some Customer Service calls - we got a great review from a customer in Michigan who said
(pulls a note out of her
pocket, reads)

--	opening our box was like giving a gift to herself. Thought that was cool.

A WAVE starts across the office, and as it reaches Jules, she does a half-assed version and is off to the Conference Room.

INT. CTF LOBBY - SAME TIME

A couple of White Leather Sofas, iPads on security cords sit on a coffee table. Huge CTF photos on the walls. Lady Gaga plays in the b.g.

Ben, in a suit and tie, takes in his surroundings as he approaches the 21-year-old jeans and tank top wearing Receptionist who’s eating a taco. Behind her, a huge flat screen runs behind-the-scenes footage of a photo shoot.

BEN
Hi, I’m Ben Whittaker. I received
an e-mail about an interview for
the Senior Intern Program.
(kind of laughs at the

idea)

RECEPTIONIST
Hey Ben, how’s it goin’?
 
10.

BEN
It’s goin’ good. Real good. Thank
you.

RECEPTIONIST
Excellent.	Take a seat right
around the corner and someone from
Talent Acquisition will come get

you.

Ben thanks her, heads around the corner mumbling, “Talent Acquisition” and sees a dozen older folks waiting for interviews. It looks like a Doctor’s waiting room. Ben takes a seat among them.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - UPSTAIRS -	SAME TIME

A long white table and white chairs. Jules and a group of co-workers stand, crowding around a computer. One of the girls in the group, holds a small dog.

JULES
Guys, you have to remember, the home page has to read in a glance.
(backs 4 feet away)
Also, none of you are over thirty
so you need to get back like this
to see what this looks like if
you’re like over 35.
(squints)

Okay, so I can’t see anything, but if I could see it, what do you want me to read?
(reading)
Nine girls one shirt or Check out
the fit.

ROBBY, mid-twenties, jeans, T-shirt.

ROBBY
Both. But I really want you to see the shirt worn by nine different body types.

JULES
Okay, then you gotta make me see
that.	Try making the photo grid
bigger and the type smaller.
(the Photo grid ENLARGES)
Oh! Love that one of them’s
pregnant.

ZOE - cute, 30, Asian and pregnant.

ZOE
Thanks.
 
11.

JULES
It would be good if you could put
the girl in the red shirt in the
middle? It’s a great red. It’s

gonna fly outta here.

ROBBY
We really don’t have the time, Jules. I needed you to sign off on this two hours ago.

JULES
I know, but can you try?

Robby and Zoe exchange a look as a Tech kid works quickly.

JULES (cont’d)
Mia, tell me that thing again.

MIA, striped Tee, bold glasses, typing on her laptop.

MIA
Forty-six percent of our visitors
don’t go past the home page.

JULES
Man, we have to fix that. How long do we have them for before they leave?

MIA
Seven to nine seconds.

JULES
(totally focused on that
remark manages to say)
Did we order lunch?

ZOE
(yells)
Becky!

The Techie spins his laptop around, shows the new Home Page to Jules.

JULES
I love it.

TECHIE
(hits a few keys)
And it’s up.

JULES
Thank you!
(turns to another group at
the table)
(MORE)
 
12.

JULES (cont'd)
Okay, the Antoinette dress. Major
screw up by the vendor.


DOWNSTAIRS -- A TINY 22 YEAR OLD - KEIRA

In a short sundress, Converse, purple braided hair, walks Ben into her SMALL OFFICE.

KEIRA
There’s going to be a couple of interviews today, Ben. We want to make sure both of us find the right fit. Business as usual is not really our motto so hope you have some fun here.

Ben nods, takes a seat in a hot pink chair across from Keira who sits cross-legged on a sofa.

KEIRA (cont’d)
This is the first time we’re hiring Senior interns. Our Team Manager thought it would be an important interface with the community so our Intern questions might not exactly fit your profile, but, we’re gonna go for it anyway, okay?

BEN
Fire away.

KEIRA
Okay. Good.	Where’d you go to
school?

BEN
I went to Northwestern.

KEIRA
Hey, my brother went to
Northwestern!

BEN
Probably not at the same time.

KEIRA
Probably not. He graduated in 2009.

BEN
-- Class of ‘65.

KEIRA
Whoa. What was your major? Do you remember?

BEN BEING INTERVIEWED
 
13.


By a more Senior Exec.	SAMANTHA is 25.

SAMANTHA
And after Northwestern you went on to..?

BEN
I went to work for Dex One. Became the Vice President of print publishing.

SAMANTHA
Okay, and they made..?

BEN
Phone books.
(Samantha goes a bit
blank)

I was in charge of overseeing the printing of the physical phone book. I did that for the last 20 years and before that, I was their VP of Sales and Advertising.

SAMANTHA
Of the phone book thing?
(Ben nods)
So do they still make phone books?
I mean, doesn’t everyone just

Google numbers?

BEN
--	I believe they do. But before google, it was how you...

SAMANTHA
No, yeah, I get it.


INTERVIEWER #3 - JUSTIN

Sweet faced, wishes he could grow a beard, reads from an iPad.

JUSTIN
--	So, 40 years at the phone book company. That’s amazing. Seriously. So, Benjamin, this is one of our more telling questions for all of our Interns, so I want you to think about this one. Take your time -- Where do you see yourself in 10 years?

BEN
(amused)
When I’m 80?
 
14.

JUSTIN
Sure. Whatever.
(checks application in
front of him)

Wow. Did not realize you were 70. That’s just not a good question for you. Should we just scratch that one and not--?

BEN
Your call, Justin.

JUSTIN
Thanks. Okay. It’s gone.
(then)
You look great by the way. And you’re clearly more than qualified for the job. You’re super over qualified. What can I say -- great video, great interviews -- Ben, you’re in it to win it! You got it, man. Congrats. You’re an intern.

INT. JULES'S CUBICLE	- LATER THAT DAY

Jules is behind her desk, talking to Eli from the Tech Team.
Several other tech guys stand behind him, all looking weary.

JULES
So you’re saying by speeding up
check out....

ELI
--	eighty percent of the addresses in the last 24 hours got screwed up.

JULES
Oh, God...
(Zoe passes by)
Zoe, how’s that red shirt doing?

ZOE
Sold out.	We just ordered two
hundred more.

JULES
See if you can cancel that. Just
say “Sold Out”.
(Zoe looks confused)

It’s more exciting.

BECKY
Jules, the Photo Studio really
really needs you.
 
15.

JULES
(rising, then to Eli)
Two really’s.	I gotta go.

ELI
Jules, we need to deal with this.

JULES
I know. Okay, just go back to the way it was but then can you do a deep dive on this? We have to eliminate a button. Think One Click at Amazon. We need our version of that. Gotta make it faster.

CANDICE COOK, the Number Two person at CTF joins Jules.

CANDICE
I need you for two minutes --
uninterrupted.

Candice is the Ying to Jules's Yang. She came to CTF via eBay and to eBay via Harvard. Candice is the accessible, straight-forward, go-to-person for everyone at the company.

Jules, washing her hands with Purell, joins Candice. Candice opens her palm and Jules squirts some Purell in as they zig zag around desks.

CANDICE (cont’d)
Remember when we talked a few weeks
ago about the Senior Intern
Program?

JULES
(reading her phone)
No...

CANDICE
Seriously? We had a big
conversation about it.

JULES
We did? Remind me. Seniors in high school or in college?

CANDICE
Seniors in life.	Older people.

JULES
(looks up)
Hold on.	What?

CANDICE
I told you I felt we needed to do an outreach program. You seemed to

(MORE)
 
16.

CANDICE (cont'd)
be liking the idea so I put it in
motion.	It’s gonna be great.

JULES
Hold please. You’re hiring Senior
Citizen interns?	What does that
even mean?

CANDICE
There’s been a ton of research on this. The results are, without fail, fantastic. Imagine an intern with a lifetime of experience as opposed to someone who has spent the last four years of their life playing beer pong.

JULES
Do they eventually want jobs here?

CANDICE
No, they’re all retired. They just want the experience. And I want one to work directly with you.

JULES
Candice, c’mon. First of all, I’m not great with older people... you know how I am with my parents. Why do I have to have one?

CANDICE
Because you have to set the tone.

JULES
Isn’t that your job?

It’s my job to make it your job. You’re the founder, everyone looks to you. Now, would you prefer a man or a woman? There’s a great 70 year old woman.

JULES
That’s like the same age as my
mother.	That’s too weird.

CANDICE
Fine. There’s a man everyone loves.
I saw his video. He seems amazing.

They arrive at the PHOTO STUDIO where all the photos for the
site are taken.	Models, racks of clothes, hair dressers and
make-up artists swarm about.	As Jules joins the commotion...
 
17.

JULES
This is not going to work in my opinion, but how long do I have to do it for? Minimum.

CANDICE
(taking off)
Six weeks or we’ll be sued.

JULES
I know we never talked about this.

CANDICE
Yeah, we did. He starts tomorrow!


INT. BEN’S BEDROOM - THAT NIGHT

Ben, excited for his first day of work, sits in his pj’s, on the side of his bed, setting his alarm. He then sets a back up alarm on another clock, placing the two clocks next to one another.

Ben crosses to his dresser and reviews his wardrobe selection for tomorrow. Hanging on the knobs of the dresser are his suit, shirt, tie. Ben opens a new shoe box, digs through the tissue, checks to make sure they are both the same size. Satisfied, he heads for bed...

BEN
Back in action.	Thank God.


INT CTF OFFICES - THE NEXT MORNING - JAY Z PLAYS OVER

VARIOUS ANGLES: Rows of Young Employees at their computers, wearing headsets. Huge flat screens flash images of models. Young faces - everywhere. We’re seeing all these details THROUGH BEN’S EYES as he TAKES A TOUR of the OFFICES.

JASON, tall, off-beat-cute, mid-twenties leads FOUR NEW INTERNS through the massive space.

The New Interns are: Ben, DORIS, early 70’s, 4’11”, VICTOR, Black, professorial-looking and a new Young Intern -- DAVIS, in his twenties and thrilled to be here.

JASON
--	So, Interns, all of CTF, is on this one floor and that’s because we’re all about communication and teamwork. Everyone works in cubes. No one has an office, not even our founder and CEO, Jules Ostin. Who is actually right over there.
 
18.


Jason points across the office to Jules sitting stationary on her bike, talking on her iPhone.

JASON (cont’d)
She loves to ride her bike through the office. That woman does not like to waste time plus she counts it as exercise.

DORIS
That’s adorable.

JASON
(biting his tongue)
Yes it is.

Ben looks over at Jules just as she notices the Senior Interns and just as quickly turns away from them.

DAVIS
(to Ben)
How ya doin’?
(extends his hand)

I’m Davis.

BEN
(shakes his hand)
Hey Davis. Ben Whittaker. Exciting place, huh?

DAVIS
Oh my God, they had one opening for a regular age intern -- no offense, and I got it. I’m so psyched.

BEN
I’m pretty psyched myself.

Some of the Young Employees pass by, checking out our group.

JASON
New interns.
(the Kids laugh)
Hey, gray is the new green.
(walking backwards)

A few words about Jules. No, wait, I’ll let her talk for herself.

Jason POINTS A REMOTE at A FLAT SCREEN. A VIDEO begins featuring Jules in the CTF offices.

JULES
I’m Jules Ostin and I started clothesthatfit in 2011 after I worked for another on-line shopping site and couldn’t help but notice that almost 50% of all dresses and

(MORE)
 
19.

JULES (cont'd)
pants were returned with one common comment. It didn’t fit! I read the words “It didn’t fit” in at least 15 different languages.

The words “It didn’t fit” pop on the screen in 15 different languages -- all handwritten.

JULES (cont’d)
It’s pretty impossible to know from a photo if something’s right for you, especially when the models are all 5’10 and 100 pounds...
(A Photo of a tall, slinky
model pops up with an X
over her)
So I started CTF to let women know how something’s really going to fit before you buy it. Buying clothes on-line should be about more than making the return easy -- it should be all about being thrilled with your purchase.

A PHOTO of JULES SITTING AT HER KITCHEN TABLE in front of her laptop, surrounded by racks of clothes.

JULES (cont’d)
I started CTF in my kitchen eighteen months ago. It was just me, a model and a photographer, we were all women and we tried on everything we sold.
(QUICK PHOTOS of all 3
trying on clothes, then
sitting at computers)
Then we described the fit to save

you the hassle.

We see WHAT THEY’VE TYPED: “Got boobs? This dress is for you!” “Snug fit but super-cool!” “This dress fits everyone! We all just bought one!”

JULES (cont’d)
We called it human curation, then we mixed that with technology and four months later we were launched and now we have 250 people working with us here in Brooklyn and we’re still growing!

BEN
(to himself)
Wow...
 
20.

JASON
(clicks off the video)
Okay, a quick who’s who around
here.

DAVIS
So, Ben, you gonna wear a suit
everyday?

BEN
You bet.

DAVIS
Like that confidence. Plus you got the gangsta thing goin’. Very cool.

JASON
(continuing the tour)
--	These 3 rows are our Marketing Team, they do everything from on-line marketing to Google search engine optimizaton, followed by Creative - they work on how the site looks and feels then our Merchandisers, Copy and Copy Editing...

DORIS
(to Victor)
-- So far, I’ve understood nothing.

JASON
And these four rows are our
resident rock stars --
(rows of exhausted Geeks)

Our Tech Team. They keep us up and running 24/7 ‘cause those are our store hours. And this corner of prime real estate is the illustrious Intern Team. Guys, meet the new Interns.

Six or so scruffy, overworked, very young Interns in dopey T-shirts stop what they’re doing and look at the new, well dressed Interns. Neither gets the group they’re about to become part of. Ben shakes hands with the Intern closest to him and that begins everyone shaking hands.

JASON (cont’d)
Okay, very nice. Last thing. Our perks. We have a free lunch every day, an in-house massage therapist and a world class gym one floor below. New interns, grab a desk, check your e-mail, you may find you’ve been assigned to one particular person or one team or you may just be a floater. It’s

(MORE)
 
21.

JASON (cont’d)
all good. And remember, with great power, comes great responsibility and that’s why we love being interns.

Davis sits at a desk, takes out his iPhone, an iPad mini, a flash drive, opens up his computer

Ben finds an empty desk, sits at it and although the atmosphere is foreign, he takes enormous pleasure in once again, sitting behind a desk. Ben opens his well worn briefcase, takes out a new Pen and Pencil set, a small leather-bound pad, a flip phone, a travel clock.

LEWIS, a scrawny sleepy-looking Intern with big hair, sits across from Ben -- watching him.

Ben takes out his lucky Pocket Calculator, then an Eyeglass Case, then another eyeglass case. He slips on his bifocals, raises his neck and looks down at the CTF Screen Saver.

Ben stares at the keyboard, not sure what to do when he becomes aware he’s being watched. He looks over, sees Lewis eyeing him. Lewis decides to help him out by showing him to hit the space bar on his key board.

BEN follows, hits his space bar. The computer turns on and a lot of icons pop up that don’t look familiar. Lewis helps out again by moving his mouse to the Mail Icon, Clicks. Ben catches on and does the same.

BEN
Oh. Got one.


AN E-MAIL - FROM CANDICE COOK - SUBJECT:	WELCOME BEN!

Congratulations. You’re internship will be directly with our Founder, Jules Ostin. Becky Scott will contact you with a time to meet Jules. Look forward to meeting you!

Just as Ben computes this he HEARS:

DORIS
I’m in the Photo Studio!

VICTOR
Business Analytics. Perfect.

DAVIS
Floater. Love!!!

All eyes turn to Ben.

BEN
Looks like I’m a personal intern.
 
22.

JASON
Nice.	To...?

BEN
Jules... Ostin.

LEWIS
(shakes his head, then to
himself)
Unfortunate.

Jason crosses to Ben, leans over, hugs him, goes back to his desk.

PING.	Ben gets another email.

Hi Ben. I have secured an appointment for you to meet Jules Ostin today at 3:55 pm. Please be prompt as Jules has another meeting at 4 pm. Thanks! Becky Scott.

BEN reacts to that.	A five minute meeting. Wow.

DAVIS
(rises)
Goin’ to Merchandising.

BEN
Beautiful.

Davis offers Ben his fist. Ben pounds it. Awkwardly. Ben notices a Young Woman has come to get Doris. Ben glances around the office, no one is idle. He spots Jules in her Conference Room talking to a large group.

Ben’s eyes go to his CLOCK. It’s 10:02. It’s a long time ‘til 3:55. As CAMERA PULLS UP AND AWAY, we see everyone on the floor is busy while Ben waits patiently to meet the Boss.

CLOSE - BECKY - 3:54 P.M.

Becky’s desk is overloaded with work, her half eaten lunch still sits on her desk.

BECKY
(frazzled, into headset)
-	I’ll try to have her there at five. Oh, wait, I booked her with a Vendor at 4:45. Let me work on this.
(takes an Advil, chokes on it)
Call you back.
(looks up to Ben) Yes? Hello.
 
23.

BEN
Hi. I’m Ben.
(doesn’t ring a bell)
Whittaker.	I have a 3:55
appointment with Miss Ostin.

BECKY
(scans computer)
3:55?	I thought she was meeting
with her new intern.

BEN
That’s me.
(Becky turns to him)
How ya doin’?

BECKY
I’m sorry, but how are you an
intern?

BEN
It’s a Senior Intern Program. Just started today.

BECKY
Oh my God. How’s that going to
work?
(whispers)

How old are you?

BEN
Seventy.	You?

BECKY
Twenty four. I know I look older. It’s the job. It ages you, which won’t be great in your case. Sorry.

BEN
I actually thought you looked
younger.

BECKY
Yeah, right.

BEN
Any tips before I go in?

BECKY
--	Just talk fast, she hates slow talkers. Or maybe that’s just when I talk slow. Just don’t dawdle, in any way. Keep it moving and don’t forget to blink.

(Ben reacts. Blink?)
She hates when people don’t blink. It weirds her out. It’s 3:57, this

(MORE)
 
24.

BECKY (cont'd)
meeting she’s in just ate up 2 of
your five--

The Conference Room DOOR OPENS and Ben watches a group exit.

BECKY (cont’d)
You’re up! Go!


INT. CONFERENCE ROOM

Jules is typing on her laptop, her hair thrown up in a pony tail. Ben arrives in the doorway, waits for her to acknowledge him. She doesn’t.

BEN
Hi Jules... I’m Ben.
(Jules looks up)
Your new “intern”.

JULES
I’m glad you also see the humor in this.

BEN
Be hard not to.
(BLINKS!)

JULES
So, Ben I was going to say what’s a nice guy like you doing in a place like this but Candice gave me the drill so can I just be honest with you?

BEN
Please.

JULES
I’m not going to have a lot for you to do.
(Ben’s surprised)

That’s the truth. And, you being assigned to me is kind of just for me to, you know, set an example for the rest of the team. If you ask me, I think you’d probably be much better off working in creative or marketing. It’s a little slower pace. Maybe a little easier to grasp. If you requested a transfer, we could make that happen. Okay?

BEN
If that’s what you prefer.
 
25.

JULES
You’ll be happier, believe me. I’m not so fun to work for.

BEN
That’s what I gather.
(Jules looks up)
But I can get along with anybody and I’m here to learn about your world, be of help where I can so...

JULES
--	You’re saying you don’t want to be transferred?

BEN
Not really, Sir.
(mortified)
Excuse me. Terribly sorry.

(big blink)

JULES
(kind of laughs)
It’s not like that’s the first time that’s happened. Okay then. Well, looks like you’re stuck with me.

(returns to her laptop)

BEN
Great. I’m excited.

His smile and enthusiasm throws Jules.

JULES
I’ll e-mail you when I have
something for you to do.

BEN
Or I could just stop by a few times a day, check in.

JULES
I’ll e-mail you.	And don’t think
you need to dress up, we’re super
informal here.

BEN
I’m comfortable in a suit, so if
it’s okay.

JULES
No, sure, it’s fine.	Old school.

BEN
Exactly. At least I’ll stand out.
 
26.

JULES
I don’t think you’ll need a suit to do that.

BEN
True. Well, I think we did it in
under two minutes. I’ll wait to
hear from you.
(crosses to the door)
Would you like the door open or
closed?

JULES
Doesn’t matter.

Ben exits, CLOSING the door behind him.

JULES (cont’d)
Open. Actually.

Ben opens it back up, slips a last look at Jules.

JULES (CONT’D) (cont’d)
You’ll get used to me.

BEN
Look forward to it.


INT. BEN’S BATHROOM - THAT NIGHT

Ben, in his pj’s, stands in front of the mirror and dumps out all the pills in the “Monday” compartment of his 7 Day Pill Organizer. He catches his reflection and practices blinking.

INT. CTF OFFICES - THE NEXT MORNING

Ben sits at his desk, reading The Times. Everyone around him is crazy-busy. The tech-talk is so intense, Ben literally can’t understand a word of it. Jason passes, speed typing on his phone.

JASON
Ben! You good?

BEN
(gives OK sign)
Perf.

Jason laughs. Ben checks his e-mail.	Doesn’t have any.
 
27.


A ROW OF VENDING MACHINES

Ben is trying to figure out where to put his money in the eco-friendly interactive vending machine. A Young Guy comes along, taps on the panel, takes out an apple.

GUY
It’s free.

Ben tries touching the screen. Nothing happens. Tries again.

IN THE AFTERNOON

Ben is at his computer, getting familiar with the CTF site. He looks over his bifocals and sees the ELEVATOR DOORS CLOSING with Jules inside. He rolls his chair back, looks out the window and sees A DRIVER standing next to an SUV, stomp out a cigarette. Jules EXITS THE BUILDING and heads toward the car.

SEVEN P.M.

The office is emptying for the night. Davis, slips on his jacket, heading out.

DAVIS
You’re staying?

BEN
(indicates Jules at her
desk)
Can’t leave before the boss leaves, Davis.

Davis gives Ben a gangsta handshake that Ben stumbles through.

DAVIS
We’ll work on that.

Ben clicks on his e-mail one last time.	Still nothing.


INT. BEN’S HOUSE - THE NEXT A.M.

Ben’s TWO ALARM CLOCKS go off within a second of one another.
We find Ben sitting in a chair, fully dressed, ready to go.

BEN
(rises)
Let’s make it happen!

INT. OFFICES - THE NEXT MORNING

Kiko, the one Young Female Intern, PULLS A HUGE DOLLY stacked with reams of printer paper down a row of cubicles. She’s delivering the paper to each desk. Guys in the office scoot
 
28.


past her as she lugs the dolly forward, Ben arrives to help, pushing the dolly for her.

BEN (cont’d)
I’ll push, you deliver.

KIKO
Thank you!!!


JULES - ON THE PHONE AT HER DESK

notices Ben pushing the dolly as he and Kiko quickly deliver the paper. She also notices Ben is getting smiles and thanks from many of the Young Women he passes.

LATER - AT DAVIS’ DESK

Ben and Davis look at data on Davis’s screen.

BEN
Okay, so they want to know what
customers bought who didn’t come
back - so they can spot the

problem, if there is one, right?

DAVIS
Yeah, but I don’t get how to...

BEN
--	Alright, here’s how I think we should do this.

JASON
(joining them)
--	Okay, Ben, here she comes, watch how she won’t...
(Becky heads in their direction)
--	Hey, Beck, what’s up? You look really nice tod--

Becky walks right past, ignoring him. Jason turns to Ben.

JASON (CONT’D) (cont’d) How long can a woman be mad at you for?

BEN
Kind of depends on what you did.

JASON
First of all, nothing on purpose. We were going out for a minute, she was cool...I really liked her...
(confidentially)
--	then I... like sort of had sex (MORE)
 
29.

JASON (cont'd)
with her roommate.
(Ben winces)
I had no idea she was her roommate.

Met her out. How would I know?

Ben notices A STRIKING WOMAN, late fifties or sixty, crossing through the office. She has a natural look, soft clothes, soft hair, and a warm comfortable confidence.

JASON (CONT’D) (cont’d) Ben, you have a lot of experience, how long will she be mad at me for?

DAVIS
Jay, I have zero experience and I can tell you there’s no coming back from this one.

BEN
I assume you’ve talked to her, apologized, told her what she means to you.
(Jason stalls...)
You didn’t talk to her? What did
you do? Send her a tweet?

JASON
No. Of course not. I texted her,
like a billion times, she didn’t
answer, then I e-mailed her, but
you know, like a nice e-mail, a
long one.
(Ben looks at Jason over
his bifocals. That’s all
it takes)
I should probably just actually
speak to her.
(to himself)
Obviously.

BEN
Can’t imagine it would hurt.

Jason nervously nods, pats Ben on the back. Ben tries to find the Pretty Woman again, but she’s nowhere to be found.

LATER - JULES AND CANDICE CROSS THROUGH THE OFFICE

JULES
Did yesterday’s numbers come in?

Candice looks through a stack of papers she’s holding as Jules washes her hands with Purell. Jules SQUINTS across the room SPOTTING BEN pitching with a Young Copy Writer. She types as he talks.
 
30.

JULES (cont’d)
My intern sure keeps busy.

CANDICE
Mr. Congeniality. Big hit. Everyone loves him.

Jules washes her hands again with Purell.

CANDICE (cont’d)
You just did that. You’re going to wash the skin off your hands.

Candice hands Jules a print out as Jules pauses at the cubicle that’s been turned into the community junk pile. It so clearly annoys her, and to make things worse, someone drops a case of water on the chair.

JULES
Okay? Seriously?


LATER - BEN TAKES A SEAT IN HIS CUBICLE

clicks on his e-mail, leans forward - shocked. He actually has one. Subject -- NEED YOU!

BECKY’S DESK

Ben awaits his orders. As always, Becky is on her headset, overwhelmed, juggling a zillion things.

BECKY
(to Ben)
--	Jules spilled soy sauce on her Stella McCartney jacket, can you take it to the photo studio, they have all kinds of cleaners and stuff in there.

BEN
Sure.	Where’s the jacket?

BECKY
(duh?)
She’s wearing it!
(Ben hesitates)
Go in and get it!
(into headset)
I’m sorry. You need the proofs back by when?
