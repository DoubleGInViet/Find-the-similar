INT. CONFERENCE ROOM

Candice and Jules are clearly in the middle of something important. Leftover sushi sits between them.

JULES
Wow. I did not see this coming. But I should have.... They want me to

bring in a CEO? Why? Because they think I’m... what? Too inexperienced at running a business...
(Candice almost nods)
Didn’t go to Harvard...?
(Candice tries not to nod) My work habits aren’t by the book..? I mean, isn’t that how we got here? Really? I need adult supervision? Jesus, I’m the oldest one in the whole office! How do you feel about this? Tell me the truth.

CANDICE
I think it’s worth exploring.

JULES
Why? Could we be doing better? We hit our five year goal in nine months.

CANDICE
Exactly. Jules, we can’t keep up with our own success. You know that. You’re an hour late to every meeting. We have a name for it. Jules Standard Time. And I get it, there’s just so many hours in the day. We’re all playing catch-up. Our tech guys are working ‘til two, three in the morning. Customer Service is swamped. We’re running out of inventory. We have shipping issues, programming problems. And the bigger we get, the more complicated it’s gonna get. And honestly, your time can be better spent than worrying about so much minutia. How much time did we spend last week setting up the L.A. warehouse? And because you were doing that, we never met all week with engineering...

JULES
Isn’t this what a start up is?
(sees Candice is about to
say something)
(MORE)
 
32.

JULES (cont'd)
--	What? Say it. What’s everyone worried about?

CANDICE
That it’s all going so fast, it can get away from us. The VC’s think a seasoned CEO will take things off your plate -- that’s all -- free you up to do what you do great. You come up with the ideas and let someone else make the trains run on time.
(Jules hates this)

They’re not only our investors, Jules, they’re our partners -- they do want what’s best for us. They want us to make it.

JULES
But Candice, that new person is going to run things their way. Technically be my boss. How can I do what I do and have to report to someone else, run every idea I have by this person? Can you see that working?

CANDICE
Gilt Groupe brought in a CEO, how
are they doing?

JULES
I know, but, for me this is...
I mean get me CEO lessons, but
don’t...
(her eyes fill up with

tears)

BEN O.S.
-- Excuse me.

Candice and Jules turn to see Ben standing in the doorway.
Jules quickly recovers.

BEN
I apologize but Becky said you needed something taken care of...on your jacket...

JULES
Oh, right--

Keeping her face turned away, Jules takes off her jacket, slides it down the table, then quickly dabs at her eyes. Ben catches the jacket, pretends not to see her tears.
 
33.

CANDICE
Thanks Ben.
(Ben nods, EXITS)
The VC’s made up a list of potential CEO’s. Let’s look at the list, explore it, then decide. Baby steps.

Jules struggles with how to respond.


BECKY’S DESK

Ben passes by with Jules's jacket.	Becky stops typing.

BECKY
Something big going on in there?

BEN
I couldn’t say.

BECKY
You were in there a long time.

BEN
(touches his left ear)
I can’t hear a thing.

Becky doesn’t believe him. He doesn’t give. She returns to her typing.

Ben spots Jason nearby mouthing: “Say something about me to her!!!” Ben gestures he should come over himself. Becky looks up. Ben covers. Becky wonders why Ben is still hanging around.

BEN (cont’d)
On my way, boss.


INT. OFFICES - END OF THE DAY

As Ben packs up his briefcase, he notices Jules sitting alone in the Conference Room. She wipes the corner of her eye, turns her back to the room.

LEWIS
Hey Ben. Ben?
(Ben turns)
How old’s that briefcase?

Ben looks down at his well worn, very loved briefcase.

BEN
It’s a 1973 Dunhill London Two
Buckle. They don’t make this one
anymore.
 
34.

LEWIS
(eyeing it)
I’m a little in love with it.

BEN
It’s a classic, Lewis. Unbeatable.

Ben turns his attention back to Jules and sees her leaving the conference room, wearing her sunglasses. She heads for the elevator, clearly in a funk.

Ben takes this in, snaps his briefcase shut.


EXT. CTF - THE FOLLOWING MORNING - ESTABLISHING


INT. OFFICES

Jules makes her way through the office, still in her sunglasses, carrying her iPad, holding a Starbucks. As she passes the desk usually piled high with everyone’s crap she stops short. It is now a cleaned up perfectly empty cube. Those around her watch her react.

JULES
Okay, this is thrilling.

A few people nearby laugh.	Jules takes off her sunglasses.

JULES (cont’d)
I swear I was going stay late and
do this myself.

ALI
Ben came in at 7 this morning and
did it.

JULES
Who?

A few others look up.	She doesn’t know him?

ALI
Ben.	Your intern.

Jules cranes her neck to find Ben, doesn’t even know where to look. Candice watches from her desk and hits the P.A.

CANDICE
(over the P.A.)
Ben Whittaker!

WIDE - A SEA of CUBICLES

BEN’S HEAD RISES OUT OF HIS CUBE, wondering what’s up.
 
35.

JULES
(spots him - points to the
clean cubicle)
Brilliant! Thank you!	Best thing
that’s happened around here all
week.

Ben raises two fingers to his forehead, saluting her from across the room. The entire office applauds.

MOMENTS LATER

Ben is on-line at his desk when a LOVELY PAIR OF HANDS begin massaging his shoulders.

WOMAN O.S.
This is your gift for a job well
done.

Ben turns, looks up and there she is -- The beautiful Woman he spotted days ago, across the room. She speaks with an English accent and smells like lavender. She rubs his shoulders.

WOMAN
I’m Fiona -- the house masseuse.
This feel okay?

BEN
Feels great actually. Thank you.

FIONA
You’re a bit tight, Ben.

BEN
Haven’t sat at a desk for a while.
My body’s not used to it.

FIONA
I get it, plus they say “sitting” is the new smoking. Let me see what I can do.

Ben inhales deeply as she massages him. Feels good. Lewis and Davis smile to one another. Ben’s a happy guy.

FIONA (cont’d)
I spotted you the other day, in the lunch room.
(Ben can’t believe that)
Then someone told me you were an
intern. So clever of you to do
this.
 
36.

BEN
It’s a brave new world. Thought I’d jump in, see what it’s all about.

FIONA
(pulls up a chair, reaches
under Ben’s jacket) Absolutely. I’m constantly amazed at what they do here. Love being part of it.

As Fiona slides her hands down Ben’s back and toward his bum, Ben’s eyes go wide.

Davis and Lewis sit on either side of Ben. Lewis’s eyes widen, then he indicates Ben’s crotch. Davis checks it out. Whoa. Big Ben. He definitely has an erection.

FIONA (cont’d)
Feeling better?

BEN
(barely able to speak)
Much.

Davis tosses a newspaper on Ben’s lap.

DAVIS
Here you go.

Ben nods appreciatively, nervously spreads out the paper. Fiona straightens out Ben’s jacket, a final rub on the shoulders.

FIONA
Great to meet you.	Love that
there’s another oldie but goodie
here.
(hands him her card)

See you again?

BEN
Love to.

And with a final pat on Ben’s shoulders, she’s off. Ben watches her go, then puts a fist out on either side and both boys pound him.

BEN, DAVIS AND LEWIS WALKING THRU THE OFFICE	- LATER

The Boys are returning from lunch.

LEWIS
So, wait, you’re saying you shave every day of your life -- even on Sundays and even if you know you’re

(MORE)
 
37.

LEWIS (cont'd)
not going to see anyone you know...
(Ben rolls his eyes)

DAVIS
(reads his iPhone)
How is this possible? I’m on cheapapartments.com and I literally can’t afford a single apartment in all of Brooklyn.
(scans the site)
My parents gave me two weeks to
find a place and that is just not

going to happen.

BEN
Getting evicted?

DAVIS
Hey, I’m in no rush but apparently they are.

Something catches Ben’s attention OUT THE WINDOW. He moves closer, sees JULES'S DRIVER, tucked in an alley, drinking from a paper bag then stashing the bottle in his pocket. He seems to have a slight balance problem when he tries to answer his cell.

Ben turns, LOOKS FOR JULES - SEES her slipping on her jacket.


EXT. BUILDING

The Driver, MIKE, stands by the SUV, popping a couple of Chiclets in his mouth. Ben approaches, a bit out of breath.

BEN
Hey, how’s it goin’?	Mike, right?

MIKE
Yeah.

BEN
I’m Ben, I work for Jules.

MIKE
(not much eye contact)
She’ll be down in a minute.

BEN
I know, look, I don’t want to make you uncomfortable but I just happened to have looked out the window and it appeared you were drinking something from a bag, so --
 
38.

MIKE
(heading for the car)
I don’t know what you’re talking
about Pops.

BEN
(sees Jules heading out)
Why don’t you tell Jules you can’t drive her today or I’m gonna have to.

Jules arrives, sees Mike and Ben.

JULES
(to Mike)
We all good?

MIKE
Yeah.

Mike opens the rear passenger door, Jules gets in. As Mike is about to close the door, he looks up, sees Ben has moved closer.

MIKE (cont’d)
-- Jules...
(She looks up at him)
Sorry to do this, but I’m actually not feelin’ so hot -- not sure I should be driving. Wouldn’t want to give you anything.

JULES
Oh, sure, yeah.	No, take the day
off and feel better, okay?

Mike thanks Jules and EXITS. Jules immediately washes her hands with Purell, checks her watch.

BEN (O.S.)
I’m happy to cover for Mike..

JULES
(Jules looks up, sees Ben
at the open door, holding
the car keys)

That’s okay, Becky can drive me.

BEN
Really? You want to give her more to do?

INT. SUV - MOVING - DAY

Ben is now behind the wheel.
 
39.

JULES
(typing on her iPad)
Hope you don’t mind if I don’t get in the front. Not trying to be rude but I think better in the back. I mean, I could get in the front but...

BEN
(stopping her)
-- This is perfect.

JULES
(reading her iPad)
Yeah.
(cell RINGS)

And everything you hear in the car is strictly confidential, okay?

BEN
Goes without sayin’.

JULES
(answers cell)
Hi Mom...

She places the call on SPEAKERPHONE while typing on her iPad.

JULES'S MOM (O.S.)
I found you!

JULES
Yeah... What’s up? How’s
everything?

JULES'S MOM
Everything’s comin’ along. Your Dad
and I are finally putting together
all our research at the hospital.

JULES
(typing)
That great...

JULES'S MOM
I hear you typing...
(Jules types more softly) We’ve been studying women under 40 who sleep less than six hours a night...

JULES
(suddenly interested)
And?	What’d you find out?
 
40.

JULES'S MOM
Seems they’re approximately 38% more likely to experience major weight gain and 11% more likely to become obese compared with women who slept 7 hours a night.

JULES
(looks down at herself)
Are you kidding me!	You know I
haven’t slept in two years.

JULES'S MOM
I can’t change the facts, dear.

JULES
(typing)
Look, Mom, I’m rushing into the city for a meeting and I need to prepare. Can I call you when I get home?

JULES'S MOM
You don’t have to.

JULES
Okay.	Love you.

JULES'S MOM
Thank you.

Ben can’t help but react to that. Jules looks into the rear view mirror. Ben’s eyes are steady on the road.

PING. Jules clicks on Face Time on her iPad. It’s Candice.

CANDICE
How we doing?	Did you look over
the material on Sheekey?

JULES
I did... CMO Travelocity,
Citigroup... I get it. He’s major.

CANDICE
He is. And the best thing about him is he’s been watching us and he loves what we’re doing. But he’s only one of the names on the list, so if you don’t like him, we move on. But try to be open. He’s supposed to be kind of brilliant and the VC’s love him. A lot.
 
41.

JULES
Acchhh. Mark Zuckerberg never
brought in a CEO. And he was a
teenager.

Ben agrees.	Tries not to nod.	Jules notices.

CANDICE
Call me after!


BEN OPENS JULES'S CAR DOOR

We’re on PARK AVENUE.	Jules steps out of the car.

JULES
This shouldn’t take more than an hour, if you can’t stay here, I’ll call Becky and she’ll find you, then just pull up and--

BEN
--I’ll be here.

JULES
Oh.
(almost to herself)
I think I forgot to eat today.

BEN
Should I pick you up some sushi?

JULES
No, I eat too much mercury. I’ll be fine. I’m good. I’m also kinda nauseous, so...

Jules's eyes go up to the skyscraper in front of her, then looks to Ben, a bit self-conscious. Ben gives her a “go get ‘em” kind of fist-move. She acknowledges it, nods.

INT. PLUSH OFFICE SUITE - MOMENTS LATER

Jules follows an Assistant down a long corridor. She’s nervous, her palm hitting the side of her leg, heart pounding. The Assistant shows her into a large office where ERIC SHEEKEY stands with his back to the door. He hangs up from a call and turns in Jules’s direction.

Jules catches Eric’s ready smile and dimples he’s a bit too proud of. They shake hands but all Jules sees is:

ERIC’S HAIR. He uses a product that gives him a wet look. One strand strategically falls on his forehead.
 
42.

ERIC
Jules!

Because of Jules’s state of mind, she catches only PIECES of what Eric says. JUMP CUTS tell the story.

ERIC (cont’d)
Congratulations. You are a great
merchant and a passionate
visionary.
(Jules forces a smile)
But let’s look at where you are
from 30,000 feet, shall we?
(Jules is finding it hard
to swallow)

You’ve had your arms wrapped around the business really well -- until the last two quarters. But what everyone wants is a long term sustainable business and at this point, we still need hyper-growth. So what’s the plan to make that happen for CTF?

Jules starts to answer but a cough comes out instead. Eric pours water from a sleek water pitcher and holds the pitcher up a little too high, the water flowing in slow mo, right into the glass.

We both know 90% of all tech companies fail so you’re going to need me, or someone like me to get you over this hump. We also know mobile is the future... you need a plan for that and you needed it six months ago.
(hands Jules the glass of
water)

--	You have relentless perseverance, Jules, I’ll give you that, but that’s not enough to get you where you need to be. My role will be to keep my head out of the cyclone, provide insight, direction and stability. I’ve been right here before.

(Jules shifts her position)
Now I have some great people I’d like to bring over with me -- very smart, very pedigree’d. Different level.
(Jules wipes her upper lip
-	different level???)
I guarantee you by next quarter we will do far more than make the trains at CTF run on time.
(MORE)
 
43.

(cont'd)
(Jules drinks the water) I’ve watched what you’re doing Jules and it’s exciting. Your obsessive focus on the customer serves you well, I see it in all the data, but the money’s never there until it’s there. So, take the next step, strengthen your infrastructure and make some changes -- and next year at this time, you’ll be killing it and right where you should be -- hangin’ with the big boys. That’s a promise.

As Eric ends his speech his eyes land on Jules's thigh -- her skirt has hiked up a little too far. Jules catches his look. He doesn’t have the decency to look away.

JULES - WALKING QUICKLY - EXT. BUILDING PLAZA

CAMERA rushes to keep up with her. She stops at the curb, her eyes searching when the SUV pulls right up to her.

SLAM

Jules, safe in the backseat of the car, catches her breath.

BEN
That was fast.

JULES
Not fast enough.

Jules Purells her hands, notices a brown bag next to her seat. Opens it.

BEN
I picked you up some soup from a
place I know.

JULES
Thanks, really, you didn’t...
(opens the bag)
-- Oh, it smells so good.

Jules opens the container, dips in the spoon, has some.

JULES (cont’d)
Highlight of my day.

Jules phone RINGS. She hits speaker.

JULES (cont’d)
Word travels fast.
 
44.

CANDICE (O.S.)
Pretty short meeting.

JULES
Yeah. I hated him.

Ben reacts.

CANDICE (O.S.)
Really? I heard he’s so wonderful.

JULES
He is -- in a loathsome sort of
way.

Ben tries not to smile.

CANDICE (O.S.)
What went wrong?

JULES
I thought he was a condescending sexist know-it-all who did not seem to get what we do, at all, and honestly, I think he’d run our company in a completely inorganic way that would lose us all the customers we’ve killed ourselves to get. And I also think he’d replace us as soon as he could. Swear to God. And worst of all -- never blinked. An Olympian non-blinker.

CANDICE (O.S.)
Okay, then.

JULES
Yeah...
(eats her soup, Candice
waits)

Did you hear my idea about putting bows on the boxes, based on that gift thing that customer said. That would be good, right?

CANDICE (O.S.)
We have a dozen ribbons on your
desk to pick from.

JULES
Thanks...
(Jules softens)
See you in the a.m.?

CANDICE (O.S.)
Be there or be square.
 
45.

JULES
I’m sorry.

CANDICE (O.S.)
Don’t be.

Ben nods to himself. He looks in the rear view mirror. Jules leans back, closing her eyes.

EXT. PARK SLOPE - SUNSET

The SUV pulls up in front of a beautiful but aging townhouse. This 19th Century facade is lean and white with a tall black door.

JULES
(as she gets out)
Thanks for helping out with Mike today and getting me chicken soup -- Oh, and cleaning up that cubicle...that was awesome. Seriously.

BEN
You’re very welcome.

Ben starts to say something, decides not to. Jules moves to the passenger window, peers in.

JULES
-- It’s okay.	I really won’t bite.

BEN
You started this business a year and a half ago by yourself and now you have a staff of 250 people. Remember who did that.

JULES
Who?	I’m kidding. Thank you.

BEN
And I hate to say it but -- try to get some sleep.

Jules smiles in a very tired kind of way. Ben watches as Jules climbs the stairs to her front door. The DOOR OPENS and to Ben’s surprise Jules's FAMILY GREETS HER.

Newly energized, Jules runs to greet her 4 year old daughter, PAIGE. Paige flies into Jules's arms. Ben watches, a bit struck that Jules is a Mom. He had no idea.

Behind Paige is Jules's husband, MATT, in jeans, t-shirt, open flannel shirt. Matt has an adorable smile and an immediate feeling of authenticity about him.
 
46.


Jules turns back, waves good night to Ben.	Ben waves back.

BEN (cont’d)
(driving off)
Over the hump.


INT. JULES'S TOWNHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

The house is partially under construction. Jules carries
Paige into:

THE KITCHEN

The only room downstairs that’s been finished. Long open shelves, an island, a farm table. Pots and pans are on the stove. Play-doh spread across the island.

PAIGE
Guess what? Maddie said she didn’t want to be my friend anymore.

JULES
Oh, I don’t think she means that,
she’d miss you too much.
(Paige nods, agreeing)

MATT
(hands Jules a glass of
wine)
I’m convinced Maddie is bipolar. We go through this every other day. How was your meeting? It was today, right?

JULES
(sipping the wine)
Just had it.

PAIGE
(indicating play-doh)
Daddy, can we finish?

MATT
Let me talk to Mommy for a sec.

PAIGE
Mommy I think I’m winning, look!

Matt and Paige are in a Play-Doh Cake Challenge.

JULES
Which one is yours, let me guess.
(Paige smiles at Matt)
Well, I love the pink one so much --
 
47.

PAIGE
That’s mine!	Are you happy at me?

JULES
So happy at you. Beyond happy at
you!

PAIGE
Daddy helped me with the icing.

JULES
Good job guys.	So, what’s for
din, it smells so good.

PAIGE
Turkey burgers.	But we ate ours.

MATT
Sorry. We were starved.

PAIGE
We were. But we’ll sit with you,
don’t worry.

JULES
Thank you angel. How ‘bout I give
you your bath first.

MATT
(doing dishes)
--	Wait. Tell me, I was waiting for you to call. Did you like the guy or..?

JULES
Thought he wasn’t the right fit.
For me. Kinda scary actually.
(Matt looks disappointed)
There’s a lot more names on the

list, so...

Matt nods as Jules ponders why he’d want this.


INT. BEN’S KITCHEN - SAME TIME

Ben takes leftovers out of the fridge. A Django Reinhardt CD plays while Anderson Cooper is on mute. Ben is clearly feeling upbeat as he playfully hits his Voice Mail on his phone.

MILES (O.S.)
Ben!	Haven’t seen you in days.

BEN
That’s right, homey, Ben’s got a
job!
 
48.


Next -- Patty, the woman Ben ran into at Trader Joe’s. PATTY (O.S.)

Oh, you’re never home! What are y-- Never mind! Oh. It’s Patty!
(CLICK)

Ben laughs, then digs in his pocket, brings out Fiona’s card. He crosses to the phone, thinks for a sec, then dials, quickly pouring himself a drink and taking a sip -- but she answers too quickly.

BEN
(swallows fast, then)
Fiona, hi. This is Ben Whittaker
from --	Oh, good to hear your
voice too...
(Ben makes a victory fist)


INT. PAIGE’S BEDROOM - LATER THAT EVENING

Paige is still awake but under the covers. The light is dim. Next to her, Jules is asleep, with one of Paige’s books open against her chest. Matt steps in the doorway.

MATT
(softly)
Jules?

PAIGE
Sh-sh... let her sleep, Dad.

Matt sees that Jules is out cold then covers his disappointment in front of Paige.

INT. MATT AND JULES'S BEDROOM - 11 PM

Jules ENTERS and finds Matt asleep. She feels badly she’s missed their evening -- she clicks off Kimmel, crosses to her side of the bed, gets under the covers. She lifts her lap-top onto her lap, checks her e-mail.

MATT
I tried to stay up.

JULES
I know. I’m sorry I fell asleep in there. I passed out.
(Matt doesn’t answer,
could be back asleep)
I know we had a plan to have a
grown-up conversation tonight.
(Matt opens one eye)

Do you understand what’s happening in Yemen? I’m kidding... I mean, I

(MORE)
 
49.

JULES (cont'd)
don’t understand it, but...
(Matt shuts his eyes)
Want to Netflix something?

Silence. Disappointed, she resumes typing.

MATT
Sorry. Fell out for a sec. Paige learned to say “humongous” today. Cracks me up. But I think I’m ready for her to start school full time. I hate to sound like the other Moms but I’m feeling I need a little “me” time.

JULES
I know...

She waits. He doesn’t answer. Seems to be back asleep. He turns on his side, AWAY FROM HER.

Jules moves her computer off her lap, sidles up behind Matt, kisses his neck. No response.

JULES (cont’d)
Anybody home?

MATT
Can’t keep my eyes open, Jule.
We’ll do it tomorrow, k?

JULES
(moving back to her side)
How many nights in a row has one of us said that?

Matt turns to Jules, takes her hand. She looks at him, hopefully.

MATT
Can you turn out your light?

Jules turns out her light. The Screen goes BLACK.


INT. BEN’S BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING - STILL DARK

A RINGING PHONE wakes Ben from a dead sleep. On his nightstand, we see the book -- Twitter for Dummies.

BEN
Hello.

BECKY (O.S.)
Hey Ben, it’s Becky. From Jules'
office.
 
50.

BEN
(looks at his clock - it’s
5:30)
Hey, what’s up?

BECKY (O.S.)
Jules's driver is MIA. He’s not answering any of my texts. I know you drove Jules yesterday and I didn’t hear any complaints, so can you pick her up this morning?

BEN
Sure.

BECKY (O.S.)
You know where she lives?

BEN
(is she kidding?)
I was there yesterday.

BECKY (O.S.)
Okay, so you remember?

BEN
Yes.

BECKY (O.S.)
(loudly)
And you’re hearing me, right?
(Ben rolls his eyes)

Ben!!!

BEN
Loud and clear, boss.

BECKY (O.S.)
Okay, so be there at 7:45, ring the bell and walk away. She’ll know it’s you.

BEN
Ring bell, walk away. Got it.


BEN’S FINGER ON JULES'S DOOR BELL

He rings, waits a sec.

BEN
-- Oh. Walk away.

Just as Ben turns to walk away the door OPENS. Ben turns back, Matt is at the door.
 
51.

MATT
Hi, you’re here for Jules?

BEN
Yes, hi.	Sorry. I’ll wait in the
car.

MATT
She’s on the phone... want to come in? Just made some coffee.
(Ben hesitates)
Could be a while.
(offers his hand)
I’m Matt.

BEN
Ben Whittaker.

PAGIE (O.S.)
Daddy!

MATT
Come on in, watch your step.

Ben pauses in the ENTRY as he HEARS Jules's Voice upstairs.


INT. KITCHEN

Paige sits at the island, eating Oatmeal and playing a game on an iPad.

MATT
Have a seat, Ben.	Paige this is
Ben.	He works with Mommy.

Ben takes a seat on the stool next to Paige. Matt hands Ben a mug of coffee then starts packing Paige’s lunch box.

BEN
(to Paige)
Hi...

PAIGE
(showing him her iPad)
I’m playing Princess Memory Game.

BEN
Looks like you’re about to win.

PAIGE
(finishes with a touch)
I did!

He gives her a thumbs up.
 
52.

PAIGE (cont’d)
You want to play one time?

BEN
-- Sure.

Paige hands the iPad to Ben. He plays as they chat.

MATT
You’re Jules's new driver?

BEN
No, actually, I’m her intern.

Matt pauses from his sandwich making, tries not to react.

PAIGE
That’s hysterical.

MATT
You know what an intern is?

PAIGE
No.

BEN
That’s okay, everyone thinks it’s
hysterical.

Paige points out two matching tiarras on the iPad.

BEN (cont’d)
Oh, good one.	Thanks.

With that, Jules ENTERS dressed for work, carrying a cup of coffee, some clothes for dry cleaning and her heels.

She stops a bit short, surprised to see Ben sitting at the island, drinking coffee and playing Princess Memory Game.

JULES
...‘Morning.

BEN
(feeling her unease)
Good morning.

MATT
More coffee, Ben?

BEN
No, I’m good, thank you, Matt.

Ben doesn’t know if he should stay or go. Jules drops her dry cleaning on the counter as she slips on her heels.
 
53.

MATT
All dry cleaning?

JULES
(feeling exposed in front
of Ben)
Uh, these three are, these are
laundry and this button is loose,

if they could... thanks.

To keep busy, Ben continues playing the game which chimes as he goes. Jules looks over -- really? Ben mutes it.

MATT
Jules, before you leave, gotta go
over a couple of things.

JULES
Okay.
(surprises Paige by
showing her a headband)
Found it! It was in your hamper!
(Paige is thrilled)
Matty, did a CTF box arrive for me?

MATT
On the table.
(Jules crosses to it,
opens it)

BEN
I think I’ll just...

PAIGE
(whispers)
Ben...
(Ben turns to her)

You want a raisin?

She hands him one. He eats it. Jules meanwhile is examining the contents of the CTF box.

MATT
Okay, tonight...
(Jules takes a photo of
the contents of the box)
Are you listening or did I lose

you? -- Ben, is she listening?

Ben doesn’t know what to say.

JULES
Totally listening. I ordered some
stuff to check on how it arrived.
Not great by the way. Go ahead.
 
54.

MATT
Okay, tonight you’re working so Paige and I are going to my Mom’s for dinner. After school is Ruby’s birthday party...

Ben slips a look at his phone, sees an E-mail from Fiona - Subject: Looking Fwd 2 Tonite! Ben is disappointed, realizing he now has to work this evening.

MATT (cont’d)
And what about Monday? Do you know yet if we can do dinner with Annie and Robby?

JULES
I’m so slammed next week...
(sees Matt is exasperated) I’m sorry. If you want to go, I’ll be there. When is it?

MATT
See what men have become Ben?
We’re the new ball and chain.

BEN
(laughs to be polite then
rises)
Thank you for the coffee.
(to Paige)
Thanks for letting me play...
(to Jules)
Meet you in the car?

JULES
Actually I have to go...
(lifts Paige)
C’mon sweetie. Ben, we’re going to drop Paige at school, okay?

Matt hands Ben Paige’s lunch box.

BEN
(taking it)
Let’s do it.


INT. SUV - MOVING - DAY

Paige sits in her car-seat looking at a book. Jules is next to her, on her iPad, answering e-mails.

BEN
Matt seems like a terrific guy.
(Jules looks up)
Sorry didn’t mean to interrupt.
 
55.

JULES
(back to her e-mails)
That’s okay.	I agree. He is.

PAIGE
Who?	The Dad?

JULES
(laughs, then to Ben)
That’s what the other kids call him because he’s the only Dad in a sea of Moms.

BEN
I’ve read about these house-
husbands.	Interesting, how that
all worked just now.

JULES
They actually prefer to be called
Stay-at-Home Dads.

BEN
Oh, sorry. Did not know that. Well, it’s very admirable. He’s a real 21st century father.

JULES
Yes, he is, which beats my 20th
Century father, by a long shot.
(stops typing)

Matt had a really good job in marketing but when CTF took off, he left to be a full-time Dad. Saved our butts.

Jules and Ben’s eyes meet in the rear view mirror. Ben nods, not wanting to go on too much about this.

Jules returns to her iPad.	Writes an EMAIL TO CANDICE.

JULES EMAIL
C - Love if you would transfer Ben to another team. K?
(looks outside)

Oh. We’re here big girl!


EXT. PRE-SCHOOL - FOLLOWING

Jules walks Paige toward the other Kids and Moms at the gate. The other Moms notice Jules was “driven” to school, eye each other about that, then turn away. Ben notices their chilly behavior as Jules approaches them.
 
56.

MOM #1
Jules, nice to see you here.
(Jules doesn’t react to
her lack of subtlety)

Not sure if you saw our e-mail, but we’re doing a Fiesta lunch next Friday and we thought you could bring the guacamole but you probably won’t have time to make it, so you can buy it -- which will be fine. Enough for 18.

JULES
I can make it. Not a problem.

MOM #2
Great.	Matt can bring it.

JULES
(keeping a lid on it)
Totally...

Jules looks to Paige who has missed none of this. She kneels next to her, hands her a little stuffed dog and her lunch.

JULES (cont’d)
Have a great day, honey and have
fun at Ruby’s party, okay?

PAIGE
Mommy do you know how to make
guacamole? You can tell me the
truth.

JULES
Yes, I do. Really well! We’ll make it together, okay? Followed by a mother-daughter dance party...

Paige nods with a big smile. A worried-looking little girl in braids watches them standing behind one of the Moms.

JULES (cont’d)
(to the girl)
Hey Maddie, what’s up?
(Maddie ducks behind her

Mom)

PAIGE
Bipolar.

JULES
OhmyGod..
(hugs Paige.)
I love you big girl.
 
57.


THE CAR DOOR SLAMS

Jules hits the backseat hard.

JULES
God! Taking the high road is
exhausting!	It’s 2013, are we
really still critical of working
Moms?!	Seriously? Still?
(to Ben)
I’m sorry. That was all rhetorical.

No need to respond.

BEN
Wasn’t going to.

As Ben pulls into traffic. Jules notices Candice has written her back.

CANDICE’S EMAIL
Transfer Ben? Really?	Why?

JULES TYPES
I don’t know.	Too observant.

Jules rubs her temples then turns her attention to the CTF BOX next to her.

JULES
Oh! Ben, I want to stop at the
warehouse.	480 Greenpoint.

Ben moves into the LEFT LANE.

JULES (cont’d)
No, no, make a right. 9th to
Hamilton to the Expressway.

BEN
I think we should take 4th to
Flatbush. Much faster.

JULES
It won’t be.

BEN
By 12 minutes. At least.
(sees her in the rearview)
Can I try?


EXT. CTF WAREHOUSE - GREENPOINT - DAY

The SUV sits in front of a block long warehouse with the letters CTF on the outside.
 
58.


INT. SUV

JULES
I apologize.

BEN
No need.

They both open their car doors at the same time.


INT. WAREHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Endless rows of shelving units. Workers on golf carts. An enormous table in the center where mostly Latina Female Workers fold the clothes, toss them in plastic bags and box them.

Ben stands near the door, shaking hands with the Foreman, then catches Jules showing the Workers the photo on her iPhone. She then demonstrates what she wants by carefully folding the clothes herself and neatly placing them in bags. She makes a joke and the women around the table laugh. Ben can’t help but be impressed. SAMBA MUSIC BEGINS.

EXT. CTF - A LITTLE LATER - ESTABLISHING - MUSIC CONTINUES


INT. CTF’S MASSAGE ROOM - MUSIC CONTINUES

The walls are covered in ethnic fabrics. The room is dimly lit. Fiona lights a candle when there’s a KNOCK on the door.

FIONA
It’s open.

The DOOR OPENS, Ben stands tentatively in the hallway.

FIONA (cont’d)
Ben! Come on in.

BEN
(entering)
Wow, didn’t expect this.

FIONA
I like to think of it as a little bit of paradise. Can I interest you in a back rub?

BEN
Oh, no, no thanks. I came by because I just found out I have to work late --
 
59.

FIONA
Awww... Then, no dinner tonight?

BEN
Sorry. I was really looking forward to it. Was hoping we could pick another night.

FIONA
Of course. Come sit down.

Ben checks his watch, then sits in a comfy chair as Fiona lights another candle then sits on a stool at Ben’s feet.

FIONA (cont’d)
What about a foot massage?

BEN
(giggles, tries to resist)
During office hours?

FIONA
That’s kinda the point.
(points to Ben’s feet)
May I?

Ben nods as Fiona slips off his shoes, then gently rolls his socks down and off. Ben slides down a bit in his chair.

BEN
It’s already pretty good.

FIONA
All I’ve done is take off your
socks.

BEN
Yeah, well, no one’s ever done that better.
(then, as she begins)

Whoa!

Fiona has placed oil in her hands and has taken Ben’s right foot between her palms and massages it deeply. Ben’s dying.

FIONA
Try to relax. You can shut your
eyes if you want.

Ben nods, shuts his eyes as the massaging continues, the candles flicker and the Samba slows down. Wow...

FIONA (cont’d)
So when would you like to
reschedule?
 
60.

BEN
Tomorrow?

FIONA
Can’t tomorrow.	What about
Saturday?

BEN
Good. Oh, God, this is
enormously....satisfying.
(opens one eye)

What time should I pick you up?

FIONA
How’s noon?	I love daytime dates.

BEN
Lunch.	Perfect. It’s sooner.

FIONA
(laughs, then)
So how’s it going?	How’s Jules?

BEN
Her world’s a fascinating one to
fall into. Hope I can help her.

FIONA
Help her?

BEN
She works on all cylinders all the time. Doesn’t stop, doesn’t sleep...never see her eat. Maybe it’s good that I’m here, you know...

FIONA
(stops massaging for a
sec)
I knew you were gonna be a good

guy. I knew it!

Ben looks at Fiona, smiles.	She massages him deeply. Oh boy.

BEN
This can’t be okay to do at work.

He rests his head back, closes his eyes. The massaging just gets better and better. Ben almost loses it - big moan. Just then, Davis opens the door, sees candlelight, hears Ben moaning and Fiona hunched over him. Ben and Fiona both turn, looking caught.

DAVIS
Ohmygod! I’m sorry! Oh, jeez. Okay don’t stop. I’m leaving!
 
61.


He can’t get out the door fast enough.
