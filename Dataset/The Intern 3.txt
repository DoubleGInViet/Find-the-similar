INT. OFFICES - END OF THE DAY

Most of the Interns have left for the day. Ben sits at his desk, reviewing an apartment lease for Davis.

BEN
I don’t know, kid, this lease
doesn’t look so hot to me.
Three months security deposit? You must love the place.

DAVIS
No, it’s horrible but I can get in this week.

BEN
If you can keep looking I would.
(looks up, notices a
jittery Lewis)
What’s up Lewis? I’ve never seen

you so awake.

LEWIS
I was just asked to deliver this huge order to Tribeca and I think it’s to Jay Z’s apartment. I’m not kidding. Look -- it says, S. Carter, I’m a little freaked out.

BEN
I don’t know who that is but is this someone you’d like to impress?

LEWIS
This is a genius, Ben and he’s got the hottest chick in the game -- Beyonce could potentially answer the door.

BEN
Okay, I know who she is. Maybe you should put on a proper shirt, with a collar.

LEWIS
Why, do I look bad?

BEN
--	Dress to impress Lewis. Go in the closet, find a “boyfriend shirt” that fits. And try to bring the hair down.
 
62.

JASON
(joining)
Benjamin, I made some progress.

BEN
Very big day for the intern team.

JASON
It was great, she yelled at me but-

BEN
--	She yells at me all the time too.

JASON
Hey, it was communication.

The guys high five. Lewis re-enters, wearing a girl’s “boyfriend shirt” -- shows himself to Ben.

LEWIS
I’m possibly meeting Jay Z and or
Beyonce and I’m in a blouse.

BEN
Wear it dude. It’s an improvement.

JASON
(shocked at how good he
looks)
Whoa. Big one.


EXT. CTF BUILDING - NIGHT - ESTABLISHING


INT. OFFICES - SAME TIME

The place is nearly empty. Jules is working alone in her Conference Room, takes a bite of a slice of pizza. She notices Ben, way across the field of desks, also eating.

ANGLE - BEN

Typing slowly at his computer and eating a Subway. He notices Jules approaching, carrying a pizza box and two bottles of beer. He wonders where she’s headed.

JULES
(arrives at his desk)
I hate eating alone.

BEN
So do I.

Jules offers Ben a beer, pulls up a chair.
 
63.

JULES
I swiped these from the tech
fridge.

BEN
Nice goin’.
(toasts her)
Cheers.

JULES
Want a slice?

BEN
Sure. Thanks.
(treading lightly)

I noticed a couple of hours ago you had a meeting with another possible CEO. Saw him arrive. How’d that go?

JULES
Was going well until he called us, I believe the term he used was a “chick site.” Then I didn’t hear anything he said after that.

BEN
Nooo.

JULES
Apparently selling “clothes” makes us a chick site. I mean, really? How is this not legit?

BEN
Couldn’t agree more. I find that...
surprising.

JULES
Sexism in business? Really?
(takes a swig of her beer)
What did you do for work Ben,

before you retired?

BEN
I was a VP for Dex One.

JULES
... Phone books?

BEN
I was in charge of printing, before that ran sales and advertising.

JULES
So big jobs...
(Ben nods)
Wait, wasn’t this a factory that
(MORE)
 
64.

JULES (cont'd)
made phone books..?
(Ben smiles...)

No! What? This is where you worked?

BEN
For almost forty years.
(Jules can’t believe it)
For twenty-some years I sat right by that window. That was my office. It was up a few steps back then. I could look out over the whole factory. Our printing presses were in that corner. That’s why the floor dips back there.

JULES
Nooooo....

BEN
I know everything about this building. Or used to. You know the Sycamores out front?

JULES
Yeah, I love them.

BEN
I remember the day they were
planted.

JULES
(wipes a tear)
Is it totally weird being back
here?

BEN
No, feels like home. Remodeled but home.

JULES
(takes a sip of beer,
notices Ben’s screen)
So you’re on Facebook, huh?

BEN
Well, I’m trying to figure it out.
I joined ten minutes ago.

JULES
Better late than never. Want some
help?

BEN
I’d love some but, really, you
don’t have to waste your time.
 
65.

JULES
--	I need a diversion. You have a photo of yourself?

BEN
No, do I need one?

JULES
(takes out her phone)
If you want to find all those hotties from high school. Hold on.
(takes Ben’s photo, looks
at it)

Cute. I’ll send it to you. Okay, now there’s these questions for your profile that you can answer if you want or not.
(scans them)
Religious beliefs, political beliefs, people who inspire you...

BEN
Jules Ostin.
(Jules shoots him a look)
I’m not trying to brown-nose you,
but I’ve been in business a long
time and have never run across
anyone quite like you. You do
inspire, Jules.

JULES
You know what? I just knew a woman at the end of the day with a glass of wine and a laptop had real shopping potential. And if we actually promise her things would fit...

BEN
See -- that’s what I mean.

JULES
(changing subject, reads
his screen)
Okay do you have a favorite quote?

BEN
I do. You’re never wrong to do the right thing.

JULES
Who said that -- you?

BEN
Yes, but Mark Twain said it first.

Jules laughs as she types the quote into Ben’s profile.
 
66.

JULES
Favorite music?

BEN
Oh, jeez. Sam Cooke -- one my all
time faves. Love Miles Davis,
Billie Holiday...

JULES
She was great, huh?	Hold on...
(goes on iTunes)
What’s your favorite song of hers?

BEN
These Foolish Things.

Jules buys the song and it BEGINS.

JULES
Transports you, doesn’t it?

BEN
Every time.

JULES
Okay. Books?

BEN
Love Clancy. Ludlum. Crazy about
Harry Potter.

JULES
(types those in)
Matt loves Harry Potter too.

JULES (cont’d)
What about your status?	Married,
single...?

BEN
Widower.

JULES
Oh, I’m sorry.	I think we should
say single then... Okay, now you
know what you need?
(Ben looks to her)

Someone to friend.

BEN
I’ll be friends with the other interns. They’ll show me how to do it the morning.

JULES
You can friend me.
 
67.

BEN
Thank you.

Jules types in her name and confirms.

JULES
Okay, congrats -- you’re now part
of the Facebook generation.
(finishes her beer, rises)
I’ve got about another hour of

work.	You good with that?

BEN
Of course.	This was great, Jules.

JULES
Yeah, nice to have an adult conversation with an adult man. You know what I mean, not about work and not about...

BEN
I know what you mean.

Jules nods and awkwardly waves, heading back.


EXT. JULES'S HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT

The SUV pulls quietly in front of the house.


INT. SUV - SAME TIME

Jules is out cold in the backseat and making a racket -- snoring. Ben doesn’t know if he should wake her. He sits, waits, tries not to listen but it’s SO LOUD. Another car passes and Jules startles awake.

JULES
Oh. We’re here. Oh...
(straightens up)
Sorry.	Was I snoring?

BEN
No, no, just sleeping.

JULES
Oh, then I was snoring. Sorry about that. You know my parents are sleep researchers and they’ve studied my sleep my whole life.

(gathering her things) Apparently my REM is all screwed up or the ratio of my flow-volume curve and my...

(MORE)
 
68.

JULES (cont'd)
(stops herself, then...)
Fun gettin’ to know me, right?

BEN
It is.	You need some help back
there?

JULES
No, I’m good.
(Ben Exits, Jules lets
herself out - they meet
on the curb, she loses
her balance, he catches
her)
Thank you. I never fall asleep in
the car so that was actually
amazing.	Apologize about the
racket.

BEN
Barely noticed.

JULES
I’ll pretend I believe you.
(looks up at her house)
I love this house. It’s gonna be great when we’re done. It just looks happy to me. Like if it was in a kid’s book, it would make you feel good when you turned the page and saw it. Know what I mean?

BEN
I do.

JULES
Well.
(salutes)
Sayonara.

BEN
Sayonara.

Ben watches until Jules is safely inside the house.


INT. JULES BEDROOM - LATER

Jules EXITS her bathroom in her pj’s,and slides into bed next to Matt who is asleep. She turns toward Matt. He stirs.

MATT
Didn’t hear you come in.
 
69.

JULES
You know... I was thinking...
(Matt opens his eyes)
We need some awake time together.

Matt nods, kisses her. Just what she needed.

JULES (cont’d)
Yeah...and that too.

Matt kisses her more deeply. Her eyes fill up as she kisses him back and they begin to make love.

EXT. JULES'S HOUSE - THE NEXT MORNING

Jules EXITS her front door and sees the SUV waiting at the curb. She squints at Ben, wondering why he didn’t ring the bell.

INT. BACKSEAT

Jules get in, cheerier than we’ve seen her before.

JULES
‘Morning.

Doris, one of the other new Senior Interns, sits behind the wheel and turns to Jules.

DORIS
Good morning.	I’m Doris. They
asked me to drive you today.	All
set back there?	Seat belt
fastened?

JULES
Where’s Ben?

DORIS
Somebody said he got transferred.
You know the best way to get to
headquarters?

Without looking, Doris PULLS INTO THE STREET, a car swerves around her HONKING.

DORIS (cont’d)
Hold your horses, maniac!
(turns back to Jules)
Which way, hon? I’m all turned

around here.

HONNNKKKKK.
 
70.


CLOSE - CANDICE

Walking through the office on her cell.

CANDICE
You told me to transfer him!


JULES - DRIVING THE SUV

Doris is in the backseat.

JULES
(into her phone)
--	That was 2 days ago! Why didn’t you check with me?

CANDICE
First of all, it was yesterday...

JULES
Where is he, do you know?


INT. STARBUCKS - BROOKLYN - SAME TIME

Ben is waiting at the “pick up” end of the counter, standing between two other office-schleppers. This recent turn of events has left him looking and feeling uncomfortable.

His name is called and he’s handed two take out trays of coffee. Just as he takes them, he looks across the crowded shop and spots Jules rushing through the door.

JULES
(sees Ben, crosses to him)
You must think I’m demented.

BEN
Not the word I’d use, but I was a
little surprised when I got the
call.	Jules, I apologize if I
overstepped in some way...

JULES
--	No, no, no. No, don’t apologize. You did nothing wrong. Look, I have a lot going on, and I’m a really private person and at first, I don’t know, I thought maybe this wasn’t going to work but I was wrong. Let me take one of those.

(takes one of the trays)

BEN
Jules, no explanation necessary.
 
71.

JULES
No, actually one is, Ben, ‘cause I’m usually better than this. The truth is, something about you makes me feel calm or more centered or Zen, and I can use that. Obviously. I hope you’ll accept my apology and come back to work. For me. If you would....

(Ben almost hesitates) And I’m not just saying this because I screwed up but I was thinking this morning, I’d like to move you up to my area, next to Becky. I know you can handle more work, if you’d like more. God, I really hate that I jumped the gun and made you feel--

BEN
I’m happy to come back.

JULES
Thank you.
(catches her breath)
That’s great. Can I give you a lift back to the office?

BEN
Sure.

JULES
(as they walk away
together)
You mind driving? I don’t actually have a license.

INT. OFFICES - LATER THAT DAY

Jason and Kiko are adding a new DESK right next to Becky who is freaking out. Ben ARRIVES holding his briefcase, keyboard, a few files and things.

BECKY
--	This is crazy Ben. Two desks are not going to fit in here.

BEN
I promise to stay out of your way.

BECKY
That’s impossible, I have no room
to--
(shuts up when Jules

ARRIVES)
 
72.

JULES
Hi. This is good, right? I like this arrangement. Becky, I want you to let Ben give you a hand, okay? And cc him on all my e-mails.
(Becky nods)

Did we get yesterday’s numbers?

BECKY
Yes. We did. I saw them here.

Becky looks all over her messy desk. Can’t find them. Ben spots the sheet with the numbers and indicates to Becky where it is with his eyes. Becky follows, hands them to Jules.

BECKY (cont’d)
Here you go.

JULES
Thanks. Also, I need to go over the data on the customer purchase patterns. Let Ben take a look at that too. Actually let Ben take a look at it first.
(This throws Becky)
Don’t worry Beck.	Back up’s good.

Ping me when Candice gets in.

Jules heads off. As soon as she’s out of sight, Becky breaks down in tears. Ben motions for Jason to go to her. Jason nervously walks to Becky and she collapses into him. He puts his arms around her, thrilled but not sure what to say.

BEN
Becky..?

BECKY
(turning to Ben)
I’ve been here 9 months, Ben, and she’s never asked me to take a look at anything for her. Ever. Okay?

BEN
I hear ya.	That’s frustrating.

BECKY
Totally! I went to Penn, I have a business degree but I never seem to do anything right around here and you’re like 50 years older than me and deaf and...
(collapses into Jason -
he’s so happy)

BEN
(sneaks Jason his hanky)
I happen to think you do a lot of
things right.
 
73.

JASON
(offering Becky the hanky)
You do. So much.

BECKY
(using the hanky)
I know that, but she doesn’t. I bust my ass for her 14 hours a day. She never notices. Ohmygod, I hate girls that cry at work.
(backs away from Jason)
Breaking news... my life sucks!

BEN
How about if you, just as an experiment, try letting me help you. A lot of your stress is going to be lifted once you’re out from under this mountain of work.
(She starts to say
something)

And maybe you should consider leaving here at a normal hour once in a while, see your friends, have a little fun.

JASON
I can offer my assistance in this
area. Would love to actually.

BECKY
I just don’t want her to think I
can’t do my job and need an
“intern” to help me.

BEN
Okay... you’re not going to want to hear this, but I heard women who sleep less than 7 hours a night gain 38% more weight than women who sleep more than 7 hours a night.

BECKY
(sobbing now)
What?! I leave here every night at 11, I’m back at 7, I sleep like 5 hours a night. Now I’m going to get fat?!!

BEN
(indicating her stack of
work)
Let’s get through this stuff. Let’s do it together. Let’s clean slate it.

Jason pats her arm just to punctuate.
 
74.


INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER

Jules, Candice and a small group are intently huddled around a LAP TOP. They’re watching a live CTF MAP of the U.S. that shows purchases as they happen. Icons of Shopping Bags pop up in Miami, Tuscon, Chicago, etc.

CANDICE
(watching a sale)
Thank you St. Louis.

JULES
Okay, look at Chicago, she put the same boots in her cart as the woman in Houston. Let’s see what she does at check out. What?! She’s not buying them either. Check the delivery costs on those boots, will you? Why aren’t they selling?

Ben gently knocks on the open door. Jules turns to him.

BEN
I took a look at the data purchase patterns... Shall I come back?

JULES
No, no, come on in. That was fast.

BEN
Well, I enlisted Becky’s help. Seems the most expensive place you’re advertising is actually bringing you the customers who are spending the least and the channels you’re least investing in are adding enormous value in segments that currently appear to have low value but actually have the highest spending potential...
(everyone stares in awe)
That’s what I could tell. So far.

JULES
Whoa.	Ben!	Could you like deal
with all that for me?	Maybe come
up with a better plan? I mean, if

you have the time.

BEN
Happy to.

Candice loves that Jules is delegating. She smiles at Jules.

JULES
The man spent 40 years in business.
 
75.

CANDICE
I get it.

BEN
And Jules. Becky was a huge help in this. You know she has a business degree from Penn.

JULES
I know. I mean, I forgot, but I
know.
(Ben doesn’t let her off
the the hook)

I’ll say something to her.

BEN
That’ll be major.
(Ben exits)

The Women in the room, just watch after him. Loving him.


A LARGE DUFFEL LANDS NEAR BEN’S DESK - LATER

DAVIS O.S.
How’s it goin’ up here in first
class?

BEN
(sending off an e-mail)
Busy. I see you found an apartment.

DAVIS
Nope. My two weeks were up. I’m
moving in with my cousin.

BEN
Excellent.

DAVIS
In Philadelphia.

BEN
Davis!

DAVIS
What? It’s only for a few weeks. I’ll get there by eleven, leave at five. That’s cool. I can do it.

BEN
I feel like everybody’s uncle
around here...

DAVIS
Why?
 
76.

BEN
Because I’m going to save your ass, and put you up for a few weeks...obviously.

Davis grabs Ben, hugs him, kisses him on the cheek. Then kisses him again.

BEN (cont’d)
Okay, okay... Easy fella...


INT. BEN’S DEN - THAT NIGHT

Ben is in a recliner, wearing pjs and a robe and Davis is on the couch in sweats. They’re watching Sports Center.

DAVIS
You got the life here, dude. You’re a great cook. You got a dream house. Big TV’s in every room. A backyard. You got it made.
(Ben doesn’t answer)
Ben?

Still no answer. Davis sits up, stares at Ben. He can only see him from the side.

DAVIS (cont’d)
You okay?
(stands)
Ben! Yo!
(no response from Ben)
Hey, look! Fiona’s here! She’s
totally naked! She’s....

Still nothing. Davis looks at Ben’s hand, which has fallen limply at his side.

DAVIS (cont’d)
Ohmygod.

Davis nervously steps away from the couch, moves closer to Ben -- runs his hand in front of Ben’s nose and mouth. Doesn’t feel a thing.

DAVIS (cont’d)
(screams)
BEN!!!!!

Ben jerks awake.	Davis leaps back, grabbing his heart.

DAVIS (cont’d)
Oh, fu--!	Thank God! You’re alive!

BEN
-- What is wrong with you?
 
77.

DAVIS
You scared me. We were talking, drinking beers and then suddenly radio silence. And your hand looked so out of it.

BEN
Jesus Christ, Davis. I dozed off.
If I die, you’ll know.

DAVIS
Very funny. And obviously I won’t, but... Oh, man, am I relieved. I am not the right person to find a dead body.

BEN
I’m starting to understand why your parents kicked you out. I’m going to hit the hay. Do not check on me.

DAVIS
I won’t, I promise, but can I sit in the recliner or is that like off limits for anyone but..

BEN
-- Be my guest.
(rises, notices something
on the table)

Why would you put your beer next to the coaster?

DAVIS
(moving it onto the
coaster)
You’re right. I’m sorry. So where are the master quarters? Just so I know in case of any...
(off Ben’s look)

It wasn’t on the tour. I’m curious.


INT. BEN’S BEDROOM

The Boys admire the well made bed.

DAVIS
I like that you do the throw pillow thing.

BEN
I was married for a very long time.

DAVIS
Whoa! Is that your closet?
 
78.


The Boys ENTER BEN’S CLOSET. Organized, color coordinated, and bigger than you’d think.

DAVIS (cont’d)
Busy man about town!	What is in
all these drawers?

BEN
Boxers, t-shirts, pocket squares,
handkerchiefs...

DAVIS
Okay, what’s the deal with the handkerchief? That one I just don’t get, at all.

BEN
It’s essential. That your generation doesn’t know that is criminal. The best reason to carry a handkerchief is to lend it. Ask Jason about this. Women cry, Davis. We carry it for them. One of the last vestiges of the chivalrous gent.
(Davis is enamoured)

I know you want to hang, but I have to go to sleep, kid. I’m pooped.
(pats Davis shoulder)

‘Sleep tight.

DAVIS
Night Ben. Thank you!
(hugs him hard)
Will you wake me in the morning or is that asking too much? My parents always--

BEN
Too much.

The Boys EXIT IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS as Ben turns out the lights. We stay in the dark..

DAVIS (O.S.)
Understood. I’ll set the alarm on
my phone... I just hope I hear it.
I’m a deep...

BEN (O.S.)
--OhmyGod.	I’ll wake you!

DAVIS	(O.S.)
Thank you. Love you!	Not kidding.
 
79.


INT. JULES & MATT’S KITCHEN - THE NEXT A.M.

Matt is packing Paige’s lunch. Paige and Ben sit side-by-side at the island, eating pancakes. A few work folders sit by Ben’s plate.

PAIGE
(to Ben)
Can you pour me more syrup please?
(Ben pours)

Perfect. Good job.

Ben and Matt laugh as Jules ENTERS.

JULES (O.S.)
Oh, boy!
(fixing herself coffee)
Okay, so this really big CEO named Townsend, the one everyone said would never be interested in us, because we weren’t big enough for him...

MATT/BEN
(at the same time)
-- Yeah?

MATT
We’re like your sister-wives.

JULES
(laughs, then)
Well, we just found out -- he’s
beyond interested.

MATT
Exciting.

Ben looks from Matt to Jules. Jules and Ben connect for a split second.

JULES
Yeah, maybe. Everyone’s flipping out, but you know I’m still on the fence at best, but anyway, only thing is, I have to go to San Francisco to meet him. He can’t get here.

MATT
(handing her pancakes)
When do you have to go?

JULES
The only day he could meet is next Thursday. Want to come? Maybe we could stay for the weekend?
 
80.

MATT
(looks at fridge calendar) Sounds good but... I can’t. Paige is snack leader on Thursday and I’m supposed to be in the class with her. It’s kind of a big deal.

JULES
Right. No, I forgot.

MATT
Maybe Ben could go with you.

PAIGE
Yeah. Dat’s a good idea.

JULES
Guys, Ben has a life.

BEN
-- Not really.
(Jules looks over at him) Not one that takes me to San Francisco. If you want the company, I’d love to go.

JULES
Really?

BEN
Definitely.

PAIGE
Guess what Ben?	Today my Dad is
going to be Ariel, it’s his turn.

BEN
That’s good, right?

MATT
You think finding a CEO is a big deal? Here the big negotiation is about who gets to be Ariel when we play Little Mermaid and, just for the record, it’s never been my turn. This is huge. I get to comb my hair with a fork... play with gadgets and gizmos a-plenty...

Paige giggles as Jules looks lovingly at Matt, almost teary-eyed. Ben picks up on this, smiles to himself when Jules’s phone RINGS and breaks the moment.

INT. SUV - MOVING QUCKLY - SHORTLY AFTER

Ben, behind the wheel. Jules on SPEAKER PHONE with Candice.
 
81.

JULES
--	So guys how long ‘til we get it fixed? I mean, if you can’t zoom in, you probably won’t buy.

Ben nods, agreeing.	They exchange looks in the rear view.

CANDICE	O.S.
First couple of hours are already
down 23%.

BEN
Oh, boy.

JULES
I’ll be there in like...

BEN
-- Six minutes.

CANDICE	O.S.
We’re on it.

JULES
Ben, do you have the info on the
friends shopping together...

Ben hands Jules a folder as her 2nd CELL RINGS. She quickly answers as she peruses the folder.

JULES (cont’d)
This is Jules.

JULES'S MOM
(on Speaker)
What’s wrong?

JULES
Oh, Mom. Hi. Oh, I just found out
the zoom link...the button you
click on to zoom in on a photo

isn’t working.

JULES'S MOM
That doesn’t sound like a big deal.

JULES
Actually it is... it’s how people
get a closer look at what they’re
buying.	Everyone zooms in.

JULES'S MOM
--	Oh, I guess I don’t go to your website enough to know that.

Jules makes an incredulous face at the phone, then starts typing an e-mail to Matt as her other phone RINGS
 
82.


CLOSE - E-MAIL TO MATT

JULES'S EMAIL
Matt -- Question. Why is my mother always such a raging bitch?

JULES'S MOM
Typing and ringing....

JULES
(looking at 2nd phone)
Yeah, sorry.	It’s the warehouse.
Can I call you back Mom?

JULES'S MOM
No need.

JULES
Okay. Love you.

JULES'S MOM
Yep.

CLICK.	Ben’s eyes widen.

JULES
(to herself)
Who says yep to I love you?

Ben can’t disagree on that one. Jules continues her e-mail.

JULES'S E-MAIL
She’s seriously f-ed up. How did I turn out so normal?
(she	adds an - “ish” to
normal, answers phone)

JULES
Hey Alonzo.

LATINO VOICE
Jules, I have not good news.

JULES
Lay it on me.

LATINO VOICE
In a routine check by the
sanitation department, they found
one bed bug in the warehouse.

JULES
Noooo!

ALONZO
Unfortunately, yes. We sent out
4800 boxes yesterday.	We have to

(MORE)
 
83.

ALONZO (cont'd)
get them all back, shut down the warehouse, spray for bedbugs, then we can start shipping again.

JULES/BEN
Nightmare!

As Ben pulls up in front of CTF, Jules grabs her bag then realizes she didn’t send Matt her e-mail about her Mom. She types in M for the start of Matt’s name, looks out the window at CTF and INSTEAD OF CLICKING on MATT’S E-MAIL ADDRESS, accidentally, clicks on MOM’S E-MAIL ADDRESS. Distracted, she PUSHES SEND.

INT. OFFICES - MOMENTS LATER

Jules, walking hyper-fast through the office. Ben is a few paces behind her. Suddenly, she STOPS, senses she might have done something awful.

JULES
No no no no no!

Jules looks at her phone, checks her last SENT E-mail and SEES SHE ACCIDENTALLY SENT the “My mother’s such a bitch” e-mail to her Mother. She GASPS, looks up as Ben joins her.

INT. BIG CONFERENCE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

At least 20 Techies are scrambling into the room for an emergency meeting. Jules paces at the head of the room, washing her hands with Purell. Ben stands to the side as Candice and Becky join.

JULES
I know the Zoom’s broken and I don’t mean to take anyone off of that but... I need a favor. I, accidentally sent an e-mail to the wrong person and she’s at work right now and I know she doesn’t check her personal e-mail until she gets home at 5:30, so I have until then to figure out how to delete it because if this person sees this e-mail, it’ll be...horrible and on top of that, she has a slight heart condition and I think this could possibly be not good for that, so, I’m relying on your good graces and brilliance to figure out how to save my ass.
(a few laughs)

Please tell me there’s a way.
 
84.

TECHIE #1
Are you two on the same server?

JULES
I’m on gmail she’s on Earthlink.

Mumbles from the crowd.	Earthlink??

JULES (cont’d)
Okay, whatever.

The Guys talk amongst themselves. Argue it out.

TECHIE #2
Truthfully Jules, it’s pretty
impossible to hack into a server.
(Jules sinks)

TECHIE #3
And you definitely don’t know her
password?

JULES
No idea.

Ben crosses to the front of the room, joins Jules, turning her away from the crowd.

BEN
I think there’s only one thing you can do.

JULES
What? Tell me.	I’m dying.

BEN
I think me and the boys take off,
break into your Mom’s house and
steal her computer.

JULES
Break in and steal her computer?!!
Are you kidding me?!
(He’s not)

That’s fucking genius.


EXT. STREET - NEW HAVEN, CONN. - DAY

Jules's SUV makes its way into a suburban neighborhood.

GPS VOICE (O.S.)
Turn right in 300 yards.
 
85.


INT. JULES'S SUV - MOVING - SAME TIME

Ben’s driving. Jason is next to him. In the backseat, Davis and Lewis. Davis is now wearing a tie, a la Ben.

JASON
Little does GPS Lady know she’s an accomplice to a crime.

BEN
The woman has a heart condition,
think of it as a good deed.

DAVIS
I never thought you’d be a bad
influence on me, Whittaker.

BEN
Relax fellas, this is going to be painless. The key is under a flower pot, we go in, we delete, we disappear.

LEWIS
She doesn’t have an alarm, right?

BEN
No she does not.

JASON
And what if we need a password to
get onto her e-mail.	Then what?

BEN
Then we take the computer. Jules
said she’d buy her a new one so
it’s a win/win.

GPS VOICE
You have reached your destination
in 100 yards.

LEWIS
This is like an Oceans movie.
Ben’s the older guy in the big
glasses..

JASON
Elliot Gould. Come on...

LEWIS
Jason -- you’re Clooney.

JASON
Thank you.
 
86.

LEWIS
I’m Matt Damon ‘cause I’m kind of
an outsider.

DAVIS
Who am I?

LEWIS
You’re Ben Affleck’s brother.

DAVIS
Why aren’t I Brad Pitt?

LEWIS
I think that’s self explanatory.

BEN
Okay, Clooney, you’re behind the wheel. Keep the engine running and your eyes open. Damon, Affleck’s brother, you’re with me.

Three car doors open at the same time.

TOO MANY FLOWER POTS

Sit at the back door. The Boys start lifting them all. Davis finds the key.

The KEY IS INSERTED into the LOCK. As soon as the Boys ENTER THE KITCHEN, they hear a BEEPING SOUND. They look around, SPOT AN ALARM KEYPAD on the wall.

DAVIS
Great plan so far. Fuck!

BEN
Davis, call Becky.

Davis quickly dials, hands his phone to Ben.

LEWIS
If we don’t know the code, this is going to turn into an alarm in 60 seconds.

BEN
(into phone)
Becky, put Jules on, it’s--
(can’t believe it)

--	She put me on hold. What is wrong with that girl?

DAVIS
(starts to panic)
This is so not good.	What are we
supposed to do?
 
87.

BEN
Start looking for the computer.
(they go off together)
Separately!
(into Phone)

--	Becky! Don’t screw around. Put Jules on, it’s an emergency. Interrupt her!
(wipes his brow)
Jules! Your mother has an alarm. Yes she does, I’m in her kitchen and it’s about to go off. What’s the code?

ANGLE JULES

rushing outside of the Conference Room, on her cell

JULES
I have no idea. Ben, listen to me.

BACK AT THE HOUSE

Davis ENTERS THE KITCHEN, without the computer.	Shrugs.


INTERCUT JULES AND BEN - JULES ON SPEAKERPHONE

JULES
--	I know this woman, trust me, that’s a fake alarm she bought from some infomercial or something. It’s not connected. It’s just to scare off burglars.

DAVIS
(freaking out)
It’s doing a good job.

JULES
My parents would never pay for a
burglar alarm,.	They’re the
cheapest people in America.

BEN
(maybe believing her)
It hasn’t turned into an alarm
yet...still beeping.

JULES
--	That’s cause it’s a fake. Trust me on this. Have you found the computer?

Lewis re-enters, empty handed.
 
88.


CAMERA FOLLOWS as they all RUSH UP THE STAIRS, in and out of
Bedrooms.	Then:

LEWIS (O.S.)
Found it!

DAVIS (O.S.)
Got it!

Both guys ARRIVE in the UPSTAIRS HALLWAY, holding laptops.

BEN
(into phone)
We found two. Which one is hers?
The white one or the silver one?

JULES
(trying to remember)
White one or silver one? White one or silver one? I don’t know.

BECKY
(joining)
Your Mom’s computer? It’s white.
(Jules hesitates)
I got it fixed for her once. I’m

positive.

JULES
The white one!

Lewis hands the white computer to Ben. Just then the ALARM GOES OFF FULL BLAST.

JULES (cont’d)
Oh my God!

DAVIS
I knew there was no such thing as a fake alarm! We’re getting arrested. That’s it. We’re dead. Our fingerprints are all over this place.

JULES
Ben, do you see the e-mail?

Ben is now in a chair, the computer on a table next to him.

BEN
(opening the computer)
Not yet.

DAVIS
Double time it dude!

Lewis takes over at the computer.
 
89.

LEWIS
Found it!
(reads)
Why is my mother always such a
raging bitch?	Subject:	She’s A
Terrorist.

Ben reacts to the e-mail.

JULES
Yes!	Delete it!

LEWIS
It’s gone.

JULES
Now from the trash.

As Lewis deletes from the trash, we hear a POLICE SIREN. All the Guys look up.

BEN
Davis, where’d you find this?

DAVIS
Under the bed. Right side.

Lewis takes off with the computer, comes right back.

LEWIS
Which right side?

DAVIS
Right side facing the bed.
(Lewis exits)
Oh, God, we’re so screwed. My life is over. I’m going to be a felon and I haven’t even committed a crime. You’re old, Whittaker, they’ll let out for good behavior, but the rest of us--

BEN
Davis! Pull it together. Can’t you hear how far away that is. We’ve got at least 30 seconds until they’re here.

DAVIS
It takes you 30 seconds to stand
up!	No offense, but fast is not
one of your speeds.	How will I
explain this to my parents?	They
will not get breaking and--

BEN
Twenty seconds.
 
90.


Davis FLIES OUT OF FRAME as Lewis returns. All three run down the stairs as fast as they can.

JASON - IN THE SUV

Is listening to Lil Wayne very LOUDLY. He’s looking out his window away from the house oblivious to the siren.

BEHIND HIM WE SEE

Lewis, Davis and Ben, SPRINTING to the car.

When they reach the car, the doors are LOCKED. They bang on the car doors. Jason doesn’t react. Davis THROWS HIMSELF on the hood of the car.

DAVIS
Open the fucking doors!!!!!!

Jason LEAPS, flips the unlock door switch.	The Guys jump in.
Davis has to slide off the hood and run to catch up.


CLOSE - 5 TEQUILA SHOTS

Five hands ENTER FRAME and lift them up.


INT. BAR - BROOKLYN - NIGHT

Jules and the Four Guys take the Tequila shots. It’s not easy for any of them.

DAVIS
(to Ben)
You’re a crazy son-of-a-bitch, you know that?

BEN
I didn’t actually. I’m sure my
blood pressure was through the
roof, but...
(sucks on his lime)

--it was worth it.

JULES
Guys, I can’t, literally can’t, thank you enough for what you just did. It was so above and beyond and brave and loyal! I’m indebted to you forever.
(to Bartender)
I’ll have another.
(to Guys)

Anybody else?
 
91.


Jason and Lewis nod.

DAVIS
Sure.
(to Bartender)
But can I just get a half this

time?

The Bartender shoots him a look and pours him a a half a shot. Ben watches Jules throw hers back and then quickly bite her lime wedge.

BEN
Jules!

JULES
I know. I can drink. It’s a thing
about me. So what are your names
again? I never want to not know

you.

JASON
I’m Jason. I’ve worked for you about a year. I’ve delivered things to your home. I’ve met Matt a bunch of times. I tied your daughter’s shoe once.

JULES
Of course I’ve seen you around, I
just didn’t know your name.
(to Davis)

And you’re new, right?

DAVIS
Yeah. I’m Davis, I started the same day as Ben. We’re pretty much besties and I’m also his mentee. He gave me this tie for example. It was his. It’s vintage.

Ben shakes his head, although amused.

JULES
I like it. Love men in ties. And you’re Lewis. I could hear a little over the phone. You were very cool under pressure.

LEWIS
It was my first heist but I tried to be chill. Thanks for noticing.

JULES
Boys, what can I say? Sorry, didn’t mean to call you boys. No one calls men “men” anymore. Have you

(MORE)
 
92.

JULES (cont'd)
noticed?	Women went from Girls to
Women and men went from Men to
Boys. This is a problem.	In the
big picture. Know what I mean?
(They don’t. She indicates
one more drink to

Bartender)
