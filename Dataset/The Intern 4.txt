BEN
Another?	You sure about that?

JULES
Yup. Here’s my theory about this - we all grew up during the “Take your Daughter to Work Day” thing, right?
(they nod, although
they’re not sure)
So we were always told we could do
anything, be anything.	And I think
somehow the boys got, maybe not
left behind but not quite as
nurtured. We had Oprah, you know. I
wonder sometimes how guys fit
in...they seem to still be trying
to figure it all out. Still
dressing like little boys, still
playing video games.

(takes her next shot)

As she sucks on her lime, Ben wishes she’d slow down.

BEN
Oh, boy...

JULES
Here’s another thing. You ever notice how the husband on every commercial on TV is always such a dope? Has it always been that way or is the “husband” the new dumb blonde? In one generation men went from guys like Al Pacino and Harrison Ford to...

She pauses as she indicates the Guys who wish they weren’t standing there in T-shirt and hoodies.

JULES (cont’d)
Look at Ben here. A dying breed...
Look and learn ‘cause if you ask
me...
(points to Ben)

This is what cool is.

BEN
Thanks Ace.	You’re not going to
drink anymore, right?
 
93.

JULES
I mean... calling me Ace... Super-cool, right? Okay, I’m officially a little dizzy, haven’t eaten. I apologize for the tirade. I’m gonna have to go but I’m forever in your debt, gentlemen... another word that’s never used anymore. Let’s bring it back, shall we? Ben, I’ll be Uber-ing home.

She starts to tip over.	Ben catches her.

JULES (cont’d)
And that is what a gentleman does
for a lady.


EXT. BAR - NIGHT

Jules is just finishing throwing up in a trash can as Ben holds back her hair.

JULES
Achhh. I’m so sorry.	I’m fine
now...
(throws up again)

Oh, God...

Ben hands Jules his handkerchief.	She wipes her mouth.

JULES (cont’d)
Haven’t done that since college.
Thank you...	Oh, man...
(looks at Ben)

You know what you are...?

BEN
Uh, no.

JULES
You are an actual wonderful person.
And I don’t know many of those.
(Ben appreciates this but
seems more concerned with
how she is)
Very sorry you had to see this.
Humiliating.

BEN
It’s all good.	You feelin’ any
better?

JULES
Yeah. I’m good now. I’m fine.
 
94.


She cleans her hands with Purell then extends her hand to Ben. He shakes it. Jules can’t help herself, she folds into him, leans on him, resting her head on his chest. She doesn’t move.

JULES (cont’d)
Leaving in a minute. Just working on making this the worst night possible for you...

(finally pulls away)

BEN
Not at all.
(she looks up to him...)
You’ve had a stressful day.

A Town Car pulls up.

JULES
How is it you always manage to say the right thing, do the right thing, be the right thing? It’s uncanny.
(with a gentle salute)
Thank you and......

BEN
(salutes her)
Sayanora.

JULES
Absolutely.

Ben nods as Jules ducks into the cab and it takes off.


EXT. BROOKLYN STREET - SATURDAY AFTERNOON

Amongst the Saturday shoppers, we find Ben and Fiona. Ben’s in a suit, Fiona, in a dress and heels. Ben’s walk is noticeably more jaunty.

BEN
Really so nice of you to do this.
Most women would have just
rescheduled.

FIONA
Not to worry.	I understand.

They stop at their destination.

BEN
It was unexpected.

Fiona nods as they turn and ENTER a FUNERAL HOME.
 
95.


INT. FUNERAL HOME - SAME TIME

Ben and Fiona make their way down the center aisle. There’s a lot of elbowing going on so all can take a gander.

Ben and Fiona take seats next to Ben’s friend Miles. Miles checks out Fiona.

MILES
(tickled)
Benjie, you brought a date to a
funeral! Unreal.

BEN
We had plans. Who knew this was
going to --

Miles leans over Ben and shakes Fiona’s hand.

MILES
How do you do? I’m Miles.

FIONA
Hello. Fiona.	So sorry for your
loss.

MILES
(seeing only her cleavage)
Thank you dear.
(to Ben)

Wowza.

Fiona obviously heard this. Ben looks at her, embarrassed and then is startled when he catches Patty Pomerantz directly across the aisle staring him down.

Just then the REAR DOORS TO THE CHAPEL OPEN and the casket is wheeled into the room, down the center aisle, and past the mourners. Everyone stands. Ben lets out a sigh. Fiona takes his hand. Ben looks back at Patty who hasn’t taken her eyes off of him. He offers her a small “don’t hate me” smile. She raises her middle finger and starts to say the Fu-- of Fuck You as the casket moves past and blocks her words. Once the casket passes, her finger comes down but we get the message.

EXT. STREET - BROOKLYN -DAY

Ben and Fiona turn a corner from a residential street onto a street lined with shops. Fiona holds a pink bakery box.

Fiona
I never went to a shiva before. The laughter was wonderful and I don’t think I’ve ever eaten more... I’m not even sure how I left with a box of cookies.
 
96.

BEN
You were a big hit. Giving the widow that back massage -- winning move.

FIONA
She needed it.

BEN
I definitely think it’s a good idea to take all first dates to a funeral. Real ice breaker, don’t you think?

FIONA
I know you’re kidding but honestly, who needs the strain of the dinner date and the “Why aren’t you married” conversation. At our age it’s not even possible to catch up.

Ben stops, letting others pass around them. Ben and Fiona stand face to face.

BEN
I can do me in ten seconds. Ready? Widower. One son. Two grand-kids. Spent my life manufacturing phone books which now no longer have a function. I’m currently working as an intern, havin’ a ball and best news is, I have a crush on a girl I met at work.

FIONA
(loves that, then)
I’m sorry you lost your wife...
Okay...

(points to herself) Divorced. Three beautiful daughters. One grandchild, a boy, on the way. I was sick a few years back. I’m not anymore. I’m an in-house e-commerce masseuse. Love my job and I finally met a man I actually want to hang out with.

CAMERA RISES as Ben and Fiona continue talking and sharing a laugh, walking off together. DISSOLVE TO DUSK where Ben and Fiona cross a tree-lined residential street. Ben takes Fiona’s hand, she smiles at him as they walk away from us and down the street, chatting, completely at ease with one another.
 
97.


EXT. JULES'S HOUSE - MORNING

The door OPENS to reveal Matt, in a robe, messy hair. He looks awful. He routinely hands Ben a mug of coffee.

BEN
(taking the coffee)
Hey buddy, you don’t look so great.

MATT
Believe me, I look better than I
feel.	Do I feel hot to you?

BEN
(ENTERS, feels Matt’s
forehead)
Not too bad.

MATT
Good. I don’t want the girls to get this. You see the Knicks last night?

BEN
They were on fire.

O.S., we HEAR Paige CRYING. They ENTER THE KITCHEN. Paige sits on her regular counter stool, sobbing. Jules is trying to get her to eat her oatmeal. Ben takes his seat next to Paige.

BEN (cont’d)
What’s with the waterworks, Little
One?

JULES
I just told her the sitter’s going to have to take her to Maddie’s birthday party today ‘cause Matt’s sick...

PAIGE
(tearfully)
--	But I don’t want to go with the sitter. Ben, can you take me?
(between sobs) Please...?

JULES
Awww, honey, I’m sorry, but Ben has to go to work today.

Paige dramatically throws her head down on the counter, sobbing. Her little shoulders shake. Ben can’t take it.
 
98.

BEN
Jules, come on, it’ll take an hour.
(whispers)
Lemme take her...

Matt indicates -- let him do it. Jules feels badly asking,
but...


INT. SUV - MOVING - DAY

BEN
(driving, mid-argument)
--	I can’t believe we’re still going through this. I’m going the right way. Please, have a little trust.

ANGLE - THE BACK SEAT

Paige is in her car seat, looks up from her toy computer.

PAIGE
But the park where the party is--
(looks outside)
Oh, actually this is it.

(returns to computer)

BEN
(shakes his head)
Like a clone.


EXT. PROSPECT PARK PLAY AREA - MOMENTS LATER

A dozen Moms and their 4 Year Olds. Ben arrives holding Paige’s hand and carrying a gift. The Moms who gave Jules a hard time at school are all here and silently comment to one another about Paige’s escort.

BEN
(whispers to Paige)
Which one is Maddie?

PAIGE
(whispers)
The one in the pink.

Ben looks over at a group of kids and sees Ten Little Girls huddled together all wearing pink.

PAIGE (cont’d)
You can sit with the other Moms,
okay?
 
99.

BEN
Okay.	Want to give Maddie her
present?

Paige rushes off as Ben joins the Moms on the benches.

BEN (cont’d)
Hi. I’m Ben, I’m helping Matt and Jules out today.

MOM #2
Oh, are you Matt’s Dad?

BEN
No, no, I work for Jules.

One of the Mom’s mumbles to another -- that can’t be fun.

BEN (cont’d)
(catching her drift)
Hmmm?

MOM #1
Oh, nothing, I’ve heard she’s, you know, kind of “tough.”
(the Other Moms agree)

BEN
Tough? Jules? She’s a total bad ass. Guess that’s how she became an internet sensation.
(sees Women are
uncomfortable)
Must make you proud, huh? One of your own out there every day crashing the glass ceiling of the tech world. So -- bravo! Good for her. Right?

MOM #1
(eating shit)
Yeah...no...for sure.

Ben raises his fist in solidarity. Paige runs to Ben, cuddles up next to him.

BEN
What’s up kiddo?

PAIGE
I don’t feel good.

BEN
Want to sit on my lap?

Paige nods.	Ben lifts her onto his lap, feels her forehead.
 
100.

MOM #2
If she’s sick, she probably
shouldn’t be here.

MOM #2’s Daughter heads for Paige. Her Mom grabs her arm, yanks her back.

BEN
Tough crowd, Paigey. Should we hit the road?

PAIGE
Does that mean leave?


INT. SUV - MOVING - PARK SLOPE - SHORTLY AFTER

Paige now seems fine and energetic as they drive down Jules's street.

PAIGE
I spy with my little
eye...something... blue!

BEN
Is it the car next to us?

PAIGE
No.

BEN
Is it that dog leash?

PAIGE
No!

BEN
Is it the sky?

PAIGE
Yes!	You got one! Your turn Ben.

As Ben nears the house, he SEES Matt, looking entirely better and bounding down the front steps in a GREEN T-SHIRT.

BEN
Okay, I have a good one.	I spy
with my little eye - something
green...

PAIGE
(looking the opposite way,
yawns)
Is it that tree?

BEN
Nope.
 
101.

PAIGE
Is it that front door? Well, that’s kinda green.

Ben watches as Matt SMILES AND WAVES TO SOMEONE IN A WAITING SUV. Curious, Ben gets a little closer and sees it’s a WOMAN WITH DARK HAIR. Matt gets in the Woman’s car and they immediately kiss and then kiss again and again.

ANGLE - BEN

Dumbstruck. He’s now dangerously close to the Woman’s car. He slows down as Matt and the Woman separate, go back for one more kiss, then drive off.

PAIGE
--	Is it Ben? Is it that front door?

BEN
Yeah, it is. Good girl.

Ben can’t process what he just witnessed. He’s momentarily frozen. A car honks at him. Snapping to, he turns at the corner, looks in the rear view and sees Paige nodding off. Ben pulls over, parks under a tree, tries to compute what he just saw. Just then, a TEXT FROM JULES. He looks at his phone:

TEXT
How’s it going?	Thank you! :)

Ben’s finger trembles but he manages to type back: A-OK. Then, adds an exclamation point before shutting his eyes for a quick sec.

His heart races, he can’t seem to focus. And then he hears something familiar. He looks up at the rear view and sees Paige is snoring. He looks at her sweet little face and feels a new found pain just at the sight of her.

EXT. JULES'S HOUSE - AN HOUR LATER

Ben walks up the steps carrying a sleeping Paige. Matt opens the door in a new change of clothes.

MATT
Awww. Thanks so much Ben.


INT. PAIGE’S ROOM

Ben lies Paige on her bed then Matt pulls up her covers. Matt turns toward Ben and finds Ben staring at him. Matt wonders why.
 
102.


INT. CENTER HALL

Ben crosses to the front door.

MATT
Can I get you something before you go? Cup of coffee, bite of something to--

BEN
I’m good. Thanks.

MATT
How was she?	Didn’t give you any
trouble?

BEN
She was perfect. She wasn’t feeling so great at the party so we... we left a little early then she fell asleep so I just hung out in the car and let her get in a nap. She slept good...

MATT
So nice of you. Thank you.

Matt gets a text, takes out his phone, quickly looks at it, returns the phone to his pocket. Looks up guiltily.

BEN
You seem like you’re feeling more
with it...

MATT
(hates lying)
Yeah. Just needed a little downtime, I guess or maybe I wasn’t that sick, I don’t know.
(Ben nods...)

Ben, I wanted to ask you, what’s your take on this whole CEO thing? You’re more on the inside than I am.

BEN
I know Jules is trying to do right by everybody - the investors, the company... you... She’s got a lot on her shoulders. The pressure’s unreal.

MATT
Am I wrong to hope it happens? I mean, I want what she wants but you know what it’s like around here --

(MORE)
 
103.

MATT (cont'd)
we don’t see her enough. Maybe this will fix that.

BEN
A CEO’s going to fix... what’s
going on here, Matt?
(Matt stops cold)
Whatever she decides...
(wipes his eye...)
I just, I want it to be good for
her, I want her to be happy.

(eyes landing on Matt)

MATT
Of course.

Ben nods, his eyes steady on Matt.


INT. CTF - AFTERNOON

Ben wends his way through the office, pre-occupied, looking a bit wan. He passes Lewis who is clean shaven, got a bit of a hair cut and is wearing a tie and carrying a briefcase exactly like Ben’s. Ben doesn’t notice.

LEWIS
Benjamin, dude, what do you think? (Ben’s not sure what he means)

Of my man look. I got so many compliments, it’s crazy. And check this out...
(holds up briefcase)

--found it on e-bay. You’re right, total classic.

BEN
(half-hearted)
You look awesome, kid.

Across the office, Ben notices a small crowd has gathered to sing “Happy Birthday.” He sees Jules is part of the crowd, smiling, singing. He takes a deep breath at the sight of her. Jules gives the Birthday Girl a hug, then spots Ben.

BEN CLICKS ON HIS E-MAIL

He has tons. His desk is now stacked with paperwork.

JULES (O.S.)
How’d it go?

Jules leans on Ben’s desk, eating a piece of cake and handing Ben a piece.
 
104.

BEN
You have a great kid, Jules.	She
was adorable.

JULES
Awww. Thank you so much for doing
that.	So -- you excited about
going to San Francisco tomorrow?
(Ben wipes his brow with
his hankie, he’s having
trouble having eye
contact with Jules)

You okay?

BEN
Yeah.

JULES
Oh, man, I hope you don’t have what
Matt has.

BEN
I don’t.

JULES
You sure?

BEN
Positive.
(takes a small pill)

JULES
What’s that?

BEN
Blood pressure. Take it everyday.

JULES
You sure you’re okay ‘cause you don’t look like you. You’re all flushed. Why don’t you go see Fiona, the masseuse, and just chill for a little.

DAVIS
(walks by, notices Ben
mopping his brow)
What’s up? You okay Ben? You seem to be slightly malfunctioning.

Ben rolls his eyes as Becky joins.

JULES (CONT’D)
Does he look right to you?
 
105.

BEN
Okay, thank you. I think we’re good here. Got a lot of work to do.

BECKY
Is it his coloring?

BEN
Oh my God, you’re all nuts. I’m a hundred percent. Let’s move on kids. Big day, lots to do.

JULES
Ben, if I’m giving you too much to do or wearing you out, please do not think you have to go with me to-

BEN
--	Jules, people my age get tired sometimes. That’s all this is.

JULES
You’re tired?	That’s why you
haven’t looked at me once since I
walked over here.

BEN
(turns to her)
I’m looking at you.

She realizes he’s looking at her for the first time.

BECKY
Jules, Candice is on the phone.

JULES
If you don’t feel good later or
tonight or...
(Ben drops his head...)
I’m just sayin’...I can go by
myself tomorrow. I’m a big girl.
I’ll be fine.


INT. PLANE - IN THE AIR -	THE NEXT DAY

Ben and Jules in first class, both have work on their tray tables. Jules is on her iPad. Ben is staring at her. Bursting, but not talking.

JULES
(finally, turns to him)
Okay! Seriously. Ben! What - is-
it!?!
 
106.

BEN
(giving up)
You know, I’m a sensitive man. I don’t look it, people don’t think that about me. But I am. Under all this man stuff that you so admire, I’m just a big bowl of mush.

JULES
I know that.

BEN
Okay!
(calming himself down)

JULES
That’s it? That’s what 24 hours of crazy comes to? That you’re a sensitive bowl of mush.

BEN
Jules.
(almost tells her what he
knows, changes his mind) Jules, what are we doin’ here? We got the day off. We’re travelin’ in first class.
(starts packing up his
papers)
Let’s at least have a little fun.

JULES
Okay! That I get.

She snaps her iPad case shut, calls for the Flight Attendant.


INT. PLANE - A LITTLE LATER

Jules and Ben are mid-meal and getting refills on their wine. Jules is telling Ben a story and laughing so hard, she can’t get the story out. Ben is dying laughing. Can’t catch his breath. He laughs, wiping away tears as Jules continues.

LATER - READY TO LAND

Jules and Ben put their seats in the upright position. Jules takes a deep breath.

BEN
You okay?

JULES
Yeah. Just thinking, tomorrow I meet the guy who may become my boss. A lot of people have bosses right? Most people have bosses!
 
107.

BEN
Jules, it’s simple. If you think Townsend is going to be good for you and good for the company, then do it and if not...

JULES
--	Exactly. Just because I came here...

BEN
Right.. Doesn’t mean....

JULES
(nods)
I agree. Do you think I can take a Xanex if I had two glasses of wine an hour ago?

BEN
I’d wait another couple of hours.

Jules nods. As they prepare to land, Jules closes her eyes, kisses her fingertips, touches her eyes, nods her head, counts to four then mumbles something that ends in the word Amen. Ben watches.

JULES
It’s a thing I do when I land.
We’re good now.


EXT. FOUR SEASONS SAN FRANCISCO - NIGHT


INT. JULES HOTEL ROOM - SAME TIME

Jules has wet hair, she’s in the hotel robe and on her iPad. TV is on in the b.g.. Suddenly there’s a LOUD SIREN-LIKE BEEPING coming from the hallway. Jules looks up sharply.

INT. BEN’S ROOM - SAME TIME - THE BEEPING CONTINUES

Ben is asleep with an open book on his chest. His eyes pop open.

EXT. FOUR SEASONS HOTEL - NIGHT

A hundred or so Hotel Guests have gathered on the street dressed in everything from bath towels to tuxedos. Jules, in her robe and wet hair, pushes through the crowd, relieved to spot Ben walking toward her in his pj’s and robe.
 
108.

JULES
This alarm going off is not a good omen about this guy. It’s a sign, Ben.

BEN
I’m pretty sure it’s not.	You
haven’t taken the Xanax yet.

JULES
You told me to wait two hours. You travel with your own robe?

HOTEL MANAGER
Ladies and Gentleman, a smoke alarm went off in one of our rooms but the problem has been taken care of. Our sincerest apologies.

JULES
Yep.	Two hundred people, 4
elevators.	Definitely a sign.
Iceberg ahead.


INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Ben walks Jules to her room.

JULES
Thanks for escorting me back. Want to see my room?
(Jules OPENS her door. Ben
peeks in)

I mean do you actually want to come in? I have a tea kettle, we could have tea...
(then)
I’m ridiculously nervous about
tomorrow.


INT. JULES'S HOTEL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Jules is pouring hot water into two mugs.

JULES
You lie down, I know you’re tired
and I’ll sit in the chair.

Ben catches the reflection of Jules's bare legs in the mirror and looks away. He lies on the edge of the bed, one foot planted on the floor. Jules joins him on the bed.

BEN
I thought you were going to sit in the chair.
 
109.

JULES
Please let me be here.	I need to
lay down too.

Ben shakes his head as Jules joins him on the bed. A bit awkward as they lie next to one another.

JULES (cont’d)
We don’t have to talk about work or anything...

BEN
Alright.	What should we talk
about?

JULES
Marriage?
(Ben gets nervous, looks
over at her)
Will you tell me about your wife?

She was great, right?

BEN
She was.	Molly was her name. She
was a middle school principal.
Beloved.

JULES
So perfect.	Long marriage?

BEN
Not long enough.	Thirty-eight
years.

JULES
Wow. What was that like?

BEN
You know when people say they want to grow old together?
(Jules nods)

Well, we did it. We met when we were 20. I was 20. She was 19. What was amazing was that she never really changed. That’s a hard thing to pull off. She handled life like it was easy. Always... even when it wasn’t.

JULES
God, I envy that.
(Ben smiles, Jules crosses
to the Mini Bar)
You hungry?	We’ve got Gummy bears.
Chocolate chip cookies. Pringles.

She grabs everything and takes it all back to the bed.
 
110.

BEN
You know those are like $15 each.

JULES
Benjamin, I run a very big internet company. Let’s go crazy. So...

BEN
(laughs, eating gummy
bears)
So..?

JULES
I got a weird one for you. Matt is cheating on me.

BEN
(almost choking)
You know about this?

JULES
What does that mean?	You know
about it?

BEN
(hates saying this)
I saw them together.

JULES
Oh, God. When?

BEN
Yesterday. I’m sorry. It was an accident that I saw them but I did.

JULES
Yesterday?!	Oh, okay, so, it is
still going on.
(slinks down in bed)

I was thinking maybe it was winding down. Fuck! Excuse me.

BEN
It’s okay.

JULES
Thanks. FUCK!!!

BEN
How long have you known?

JULES
For like 18 days. She’s a Mom at Paige’s school. It’s still so hard for me to grasp. I was in the kitchen making sandwiches and his phone was sitting there, he was

(MORE)
 
111.

JULES (cont'd)
upstairs with Paige and he kept
getting all these texts. I don’t
know why, but I read them.
(starts to cry)

It was not good. I thought my heart was going to stop. They had little nicknames for each other. She sent him a photo which is now forever implanted in my brain... I guess cell phones are going to do in all guys eventually.

BEN
Does he know you know?

JULES
No... because, honestly I’m not really ready to deal with it. I would like to be a little less devastated if that’s possible. It’s classic, though, isn’t it? The successful wife’s husband feels ignored, his manhood is threatened so he acts out. The girlfriend I guess makes him feel more like a man. Sometimes I think maybe I don’t know how to do the -- make him feel like a man thing, you know? And anyway, is that even what I’m supposed to do? I mean, that’s an exhausting endeavor.

BEN
Wait, wait wait. Hold on. You’re not actually taking the rap for any this, are you?

JULES
No. No! He’s doing something bad. No! Monogom-ish is not what I’m going for. I’m just trying to wait it out for a sec. I’m hoping it’s just a horrible lapse in judgment and not like, love -- and once he gets it out of his system, we’ll be able to eventually be okay again. What do you think of that?
(off Ben’s look)
Clearly you don’t think that’s a
possible thing.

BEN
It would be unusual.

JULES
I get not everybody could do that
but everybody’s not us.	I have
hope for us ‘cause I believe he
(MORE)
 
112.

JULES (cont'd)
still loves me and we’re going
through a lot right now and... God, I wish all of your expressions weren’t so transparent. Some couples do survive these things. Anyway, there’s something to be said for getting through it. Putting value on us and not the affair. Also, I know you want to say something, here’s the last thing -- I don’t want to give up on him ‘cause I know him and I know he knows better. But I’m only human, so I’m obviously so mad at him...
(tries to pull it
together)

So much has happened to us so fast, maybe I was somehow even expecting this. You know he was the more successful when we started out...

BEN
No, didn’t know that.

JULES
Yeah. He was. He was a rising star... I’m sure this is why I’m even entertaining this whole CEO thing... thinking maybe it will let me get my life back on track but--

BEN
--	Oh, God, okay, that’s it! (makes the Time Out sign)
I hate to be the feminist here,
between the two of us, but you
should be able to have a huge
career and be brilliant without
having to accept your husband is
having an affair as some kind of

payback.

JULES
Right on.

BEN
I mean it.

JULES
Me too. But such is life, my
friend.

BEN
No it isn’t. Not always.	And I’m
really mad at him too. Except I’m
not so forgiving.
 
113.

JULES
I’m not so forgiving. I’m saying I could potentially be forgiving. But don’t think I don’t feel what’s happening here. It’s crushing. And when I think of Paige...

BEN
Oh, don’t...

JULES
Also, I know if we got a divorce, he’d remarry, not necessarily to this girl, but someone and we know I’m not easy, so I could be like single forever which means and forgive me but I think about this sometimes in the middle of the night...

(covers her face...)

BEN
What??

JULES
--	That I don’t want to be buried alone. Paige will be with her husband, Matt will be with his new family and I’ll be buried with strangers. I’ll be in the single strangers section of the cemetery. Ahhhhhh. Not that that’s a reason to stay together, that’s just a scary side bar...

BEN
Okay, let’s take that one off your plate. You can be buried with me and Molly. I happen to have room. Okay?

JULES
(so touched, tears
streaming)
Thank you. So much. And to think I didn’t even want to hire you...

BEN
The one time I don’t have my hanky.

JULES
(wipes her eyes on the
belt of the robe)
I’m okay. You want to see what’s on TV? Just for a few minutes?

BEN
Yeah.	I would...
 
114.


Jules picks up the remote, clicks around and is relieved to land on Gene Kelly and Debbie Reynolds dancing to “You Were Meant For Me” from Singin’ in the Rain. They watch in silence at the optimism, innocence and youthful beauty on the screen. Ben turns to Jules, sees her eyes are shutting. Ben watches the movie alone, happy to be lost in another world.

INT. BARBER SHOP - THE NEXT A.M.

Ben is getting a shave. His eyes go to the clock on the wall. It’s 9:30.

EXT. SAN FRANCISCO STREET - LATE MORNING

Ben paces in front of a town car when he spots Jules, walking quickly out of the building, wearing sunglasses. He opens the back door of the car. She nods, gets in. Ben joins her in the backseat.

INT. CAR - MOVING

DRIVER
To the airport?

JULES
The airport.

Silence.

BEN
Did we like him?

JULES
(pulls out Purell)
He said everything right. Said no one knows CTF like me. Said he doesn’t want to remove the soul of the company.
(Ben opens his palm for a
squirt of Purell)
He said he doesn’t have a plan, wants to watch us and see what works. He was polite, he was respectful, he was super smart and I hired him.

BEN
Seriously?	You did it in the room?

JULES
He told me to sleep on it and we’ll talk tomorrow but I told him the job was his. We shook hands on it.
(then)

(MORE)
 
115.

JULES (cont'd)
You know if we disagree on something... he’s the tie breaker.

BEN
Of course. He’s the CEO.

JULES
Matt’ll be happy.

Ben lowers his window a couple of inches, turns toward the fresh air.

INT. JULES'S FOYER - THAT NIGHT

Matt bounds down the stairs as Jules ENTERS. He kisses her hello.

JULES
Hey.	You smell minty.

MATT
I just made mint tea.	So?	Yes?
No?

JULES
I did it. I liked him a lot and I offered him the job.

MATT
Wow. Really?
(Matt hugs her)
Congratulations.

JULES
Yeah. I think it’ll be good for us.
Do we have like any real booze?
Like vodka or something?

ON THE STAIRS - A MOMENT LATER

Jules sits on the stairs. Matt joins her with two glasses of Vodka.

MATT
Did good for us mean CTF or us?

JULES
You and me us. If someone else can call some of the shots at work, then maybe we can get back to where we were 18 months ago. They say you can’t get the genie back in the bottle, but we can try. Right?

Matt turns to her but neither says a word.
 
116.


INT. JULES BATHROOM - THAT NIGHT

Jules lies in the bathtub, wiped out. She looks over at the sink, sees two toothbrushes in a cup, then to the back of the door -- Matt’s robe hangs on the hook. She shuts her eyes for a sec, rubs her chest, tries to calm her breathing. A few of Paige’s bath toys sit on the tub ledge. Jules picks up a little frog, winds it up, places it in the tub and watches it flip around. Her eyes fill with tears.

INT. BEDROOM - SAME TIME

Matt lies across the bottom of the bed, wishing his life wasn’t crumbling. He sits up, faces the closed bathroom door, wants to do the right thing, but can’t seem to get up and go in there. His phone pings - he has a text. He doesn’t look at it.

EXT. BEN’S HOUSE - EARLY A.M.

A Cab pulls up. Jules steps out and walks up the front path just as Davis EXITS in a suit, carrying a brief case.

JULES
Wait, you live here?

DAVIS
Oh. Hi! Yeah, Ben’s been putting me up ‘til I find a place. Should I tell him you’re here?

JULES
That’s okay, I’ll knock.

Jules KNOCKS on the FRONT DOOR and in a sec, Fiona answers.

JULES (cont’d)
(stunned)
Fiona??

FIONA
(surprised)
Hi Jules.	Come on in.

Fiona opens the door and we find Ben, clearing the breakfast dishes.

FIONA (cont’d)
I’m just on my way to work, I’ll
let you two talk.

Fiona grabs her tote, crosses to Ben, gives him a kiss on the cheek. Ben smiles softly as she heads out.
 
117.


Now alone with Ben, Jules remains in the Living Room, a distance away.

BEN
Hi.

JULES
Wow. You and Fiona. Who knew?

BEN
She’s a great gal. She surprised me last night. Brought over dinner. It’s... brand new.

JULES
Congrats.	I love her.

Jules pauses, putting all that together, then rolls on. JULES (cont’d)

So, I was ready kind of early today. Since about four... and Matt and Paige left an hour ago for a field trip so thought I’d come by, hope that’s okay. Just wanted to say I slept on it, I haven’t called Townsend yet but I still think it’s the right thing to do.

BEN
I didn’t sleep so well myself.

JULES
Over this?

BEN
You remember the day I drove you to the warehouse? You were giving me the wrong directions and...

JULES
I remember.

BEN
Okay, well, I stood in the back and watched you show the workers how to fold and box the clothes. I knew then, that was why CTF was a success. No one else is ever going to have that kind of commitment to your company Jules. To me, it’s pretty simple. CTF needs you and if you don’t mind me saying - you need it. Someone may come in with more experience than you, but they’re never going to know what you know. I never had something

(MORE)
 
118.

BEN (cont'd)
like this in my career. Not many people do. This big, beautiful, intricate thing that you created -- it’s a dream isn’t it? And you’re going to give that up in the hopes that your husband will stop having an affair? I don’t see how that adds up. You should feel nothing but great about what you’ve done. Don’t let anybody take that away from you.
(Jules wipes a tear from
her cheek)

I guess you came over here ‘cause you wanted to hear some of this...

JULES
Yeah, I did. And maybe also ‘cause you’re my...
(she can’t quite say it)

BEN
Intern.

JULES
I was going to say...
(mumbles)
Intern/Slash/Best friend, but no need to get all sentimental even though we could potentially be buried together. Can’t get closer than that and I think it’s moments like this when you need someone who you know you can count on. So thank you for that.
(Ben nods)
I like your house so much by the
way.

BEN
Thank you.

They both take the time to think about what was just said.

BEN (cont’d)
So. Shall we?


INT. CTF - FOLLOWING

Ben and Jules get off the elevator together. Just another day for everyone else. Becky, looking fresh and relaxed greets them, carrying an iPad.

BECKY
Welcome back you two.	Jules, got
something cool to show you.
(clicks on a Photo)
(MORE)
 
119.

BECKY (cont'd)
Do you remember taking a customer service call about a Bride whose bridesmaids’ dresses all showed up in grey and you had the Vendor remake them overnight and we put them on a plane and --

JULES
-- Yeah, yeah...Rachel!

BECKY
Check this out.

Becky shows Jules a PHOTO of RACHEL and her BRIDESMAIDS lined up in their Pink Dresses.

JULES
The silk chiffon Antoinette dress.
They look beautiful.

Jules and Ben arrive at their cubicles. There’s a huge arrangement of Peonies on Jules's desk. She hopes they’re from Matt.

BECKY
Also, these just arrived from Ted
Townsend. Here’s the card.

JULES
(reading the card)
Get me Townsend’s number will you?

Ben watches Jules then checks his watch. Jules's PHONE RINGS.

JULES (cont’d)
This is Jules. Hey Alonzo, what’s up? Okay, uh-huh, do we need that many?

Jules feels someone standing over her.	Looks up.	It’s Matt.
He looks like he may have run to get here.


INT. CONFERENCE ROOM

Jules and Matt stand in the Conference Room.

MATT
Don’t do this for me, Jules.
Please. Do what feels right for
you.

JULES
Oh, God.	I want to continue
running my company Matt -- you
gotta know that.
 
120.

MATT
Then do it. I don’t want you to be unhappy.

JULES
I’m already unhappy.

That came out too fast to take back.

MATT
Because of me?

She looks at him in a way that reveals what she’s been going through. His eyes fill with tears.

JULES
Is it almost over ‘cause I don’t
know how much longer I can --

MATT
It is over. I love you Jules and I don’t know how to say this any better than to tell you how deeply sorry I am. I’m so ashamed of myself and what I did to us... I will do so much better at this. If you’ll let me.

Jules openly cries now. Matt waits for her response, not sure what to do.

JULES
Know what would be good?	If you
carried a handkerchief.

MATT
I’ll buy some.

A long look at one another. So much to say...

JULES
Okay...

And through her exhaustion and tears, the smallest of smiles and a nod make their way through.

MATT
Thank you...
(wiping away his tears)
Have you called Townsend yet
because if I ever met anyone who

didn’t need a boss -- it was you.

JULES
--	I was just about to call him and tell him I changed my mind. I

(MORE)
 
121.

JULES (cont'd)
mean, we’re good here. We’ll make it. I’m gonna make sure we make it.

MATT
Good. And maybe you could offer him the job of COO, under you... let him make the trains run on time and report to you.

JULES
He won’t take that.

MATT
But somebody will.

JULES
(wiping her tears)
Yeah...

MATT
I’m sorry, Jules, but I gotta get
back to the field trip.	I’m in
charge of snacks and...

Jules nods and Matt hesitates then hugs her in a way that finally relaxes them both.

INT. OFFICES - MOMENTS LATER

Jules quickly zigzags around the desks, arriving at Ben’s desk. He’s not there.

JULES
Becky, where’s Ben?

BECKY
Not sure. Said he’s taking the day off.

INT. FIONA’S ROOM - DIMLY LIT

Someone is in the massage chair. The door opens, Jules sticks her head in.

JULES
Fiona, do you know where Ben is?


EXT. PROSPECT PARK - DAY

Ben’s Tai Chi group, all in sync, move slowly toward the right, arms raised. Ben is among them. Jules approaches. Ben doesn’t see her at first. She joins the group, standing awkwardly near Ben.
 
122.

JULES
(whispers)
Sorry to interrupt.

Ben motions for her to be silent, then to get next to him.
She does.

BEN
(whispers)
Extend your left arm, Jules. Bend your knees, breathe and relax.
(Jules drops her shoulder
bag, tries it)

For inner balance...

JULES
(not quite getting it)
Am I doing it right?

BEN
Almost.

Jules tries harder.

JULES
I have something good to tell you.

BEN
Tell me when we’re done.

JULES
Okay.

BEN
Breathe deeply, Jules...

And as Jules follows Ben and tries her best to achieve inner balance, CAMERA DRIFTS and slowly we:

FADE OUT.
