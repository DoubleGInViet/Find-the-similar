INT. WRESTLING RING - NIGHT

A 1950’s regional mid-west crowd of a few thousand roar with fury as the abominable, heavy brow, buzz cut giant, FRITZ VON ERICH (JACK ADKINSSON) pummels his OPPONENT.

FRITZ grunts angrily at the crowd in a bad German accent and raises his giant, powerful right hand, making a rigid CLAW with his fingers. FRITZ guides his hand down onto the forehead of his wobbling OPPONENT and locks his thumb and pinky into the man’s temple, clutching the head in the palm of his hand. The OPPONENT drops to his knees screaming in pain.

Sitting in the crowd are FRITZ’S sons, KEVIN (7) and DAVID (5). They are the only ones cheering on FRITZ. They turn and yell at the other fans for booing their father.

INT. ARENA CONCOURSE - CONTINUOUS

DORIS, FRITZ’S heavily pregnant wife, paces in the empty concourse.

INT. WRESTLING RING - CONTINUOUS

Back in the ring, blood drips from the OPPONENT’S head, over FRITZ’S hand. The OPPONENT finally collapses onto his back. The referee slaps down on the mat - ONE, TWO, THREE - and signals for the bell. DING DING DING DING. The referee raises FRITZ’S hand. The crowd boo the villain they love to hate.

RING ANNOUNCER (O.S.)

The winner, FRITZ VON ERICH.

HARD CUT TO:
 
TITLE CARD:	THE IRON CLAW


INT. DRESSING ROOM - LATER

A sweat drenched FRITZ sits alone on a wooden bench in a grimy locker room. Wrestling might be staged but there is nothing fake about the performance. These matches take a massive physical toll.

INT. ARENA EXIT - LATER

FRITZ, showered and cleaned up is heading out. His family, DORIS and the two BOYS, KEVIN and DAVID are waiting for him. The boys run and leap onto him. FRITZ scoops up KEVIN. DAVID hangs on FRITZ’S leg. FRITZ and DORIS kiss.

KEVIN

You crushed that guy Pop.

FRITZ

I sure did.

KEVIN puts a playful IRON CLAW on his dad.

FRITZ

So nice to have you guys here for once. You see anything Dotty?

DORIS

Not a chance. But it sounded like they were all very angry with you.

FRITZ

That’s the idea.

THE FAMILY walk across the cold icy parking lot.

DORIS

What is that thing attached to our home?

FRITZ

You guys like it?
 


EXT. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS
 
A BRAND NEW CADILLAC is attached to an OLD MOBILE HOME.

KEVIN

Oh Dad, it’s incredible.

DAVID

Yeah, incwedible.

KEVIN runs around the car. Little DAVID follows.

FRITZ

I had the boys switch it out

during the show. Surprise.

DORIS

What are you thinking? We can’t

afford this.

FRITZ

Well, hear me out, I was talking to the promoter and he said if I want to be a star I need to act like a star. So he told me to rent a Cadillac.

DORIS

I’m not going to ask how much it
costs.

They load the kids into the back seat. FRITZ gets in to the driver seat.

DORIS

How much does it cost?

She slaps him on the side of his arm.

FRITZ

It’s going to be fine Dotty. I’m almost there. We need a real house, a safe place to raise these guys.

KEVIN sits in the back listening to his parents.

DORIS (O.S.)

How is blowing money on a fancy
car going to get us a house -
 
FRITZ (O.S.)

The only way to beat this thing

that follows us -

DORIS (O.S.)

There is no THING that follows us-

FRITZ (O.S.)

The only way to beat IT is to be the toughest, the strongest, the most successful. The absolute best. To rely on no one but ourselves. I will get us there, I will be the NWA world heavyweight champion, and nothing will hurt us ever again.

DORIS closes her eyes.

DORIS

Let the morning bring me word of
your unfailing love, for I have
put my trust in you. Show me the
way I should go, for to you I
entrust my life...

FRITZ watches adoringly as DORIS quotes the bible to herself.

FRITZ

We have been through hell and we
are going to leave all that

behind. I promise.


In the back seat, We are close on KEVIN, listening, absorbing...

CUT TO:


INT. THE VON ERICH RANCH - KEVIN’S ROOM - PRE DAWN

An ALARM SOUNDS like a ton of bricks waking KEVIN VON ERICH, now in his 20s. Tall, lean, chiseled, athletic, with a warm smile, and head of golden hair. He struggles to pull himself out of bed, sore and stiff from last night’s wrestling match. His brother DAVID sleeps in the bed across
 
the room.


INT. THE VON ERICH RANCH - MORNING

A recent FAMILY PORTRAIT hangs above the fire place. Next to it a black and white photo from the 50’s of their deceased son, JACK JR, age 8.

On one living room wall is A LARGE TROPHY CASE filled with the family’s athletic accomplishments including FRITZ’ wrestling highlights and the boys’ childhood sports trophies. THIS FAMILY IS TEXAS ATHLETIC ROYALTY.

On the other wall is a GUN CASE, showing the impressive collection of hand guns and hunting weapons.

EXT. THE VON ERICH RANCH	- DAWN

The sun is about to rise on the fairy tale VON ERICH RANCH. FRITZ’ dream home just outside of Dallas, built with money made from his wrestling fame and fortune. Acres of wild land, woods for hunting, ponds for fishing, fields of grazing cattle and horses. KEVIN emerges in the landscape running, pushing himself into a full sprint.

KEVIN (V.O)

Ever since I was a child people said my family was cursed. We never talked about it. And I don’t know if my brothers and I believed it back then. But bad things kept happening. Mom tried to protect us with God, Pop tried to protect us with wrestling, he said if we were the toughest, the strongest, the most successful nothing would ever hurt us. I believed him. We all did. We loved our father and we loved wrestling.

INT. THE SPORTATORIUM WRESTLING RING - NIGHT

A CAPACITY CROWD of 3000 adoring fans scream for their local hero KEVIN. FRITZ, now in his 50s, is in KEVIN’S corner.
 
Fierce boos ring out. THE SHEIK antagonizes the crowd. The famous GENERAL SKANDOR AKBAR is in the SHEIK’S corner.

The SHEIK hits KEVIN over the head with his championship belt, knocking KEVIN to the ground. The SHEIK spit polishes his Texas Title and the crowd goes ballistic.

The BELL SOUNDS, the match begins. We are close up on KEVIN, laying dazed on the mat.

INT. SPORTATORIUM WRESTLING RING - NIGHT

KEVIN, who wrestles barefoot, springs to his feet and delivers a brutal kick to the side of THE SHEIK’S head.

We see how special KEVIN is for a young wrestler. Large, quick, agile, and powerful - a lethal combination.

AKBAR climbs in the ring and tries to intervene but FRITZ steps in and clothes lines him over the top rope.

INT. THE VON ERICH RANCH - WEIGHT ROOM - EARLY MORNING

KEVIN lifts weights, pushing himself to his absolute limit on the bench press.

INT. SPORTATORIUM WRESTLING RING - NIGHT

KEVIN climbs onto the top rope and leaps across the ring with a flying cross body to take down, and pin THE SHEIK. The ref pounds on the mat: 1, 2, 3... The Bell sounds. The Sportatorium erupts. FRITZ rushes into the ring to celebrate as KEVIN lifts the Texas Heavyweight title belt.

RING ANNOUNCER

Ladies and Gentlemen, the winner, and new TEXAS HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION, Kevin Von Erich!

KEVIN is elated but exhausted. Struggling to catch his breath, his father holds him up in the middle of the ring.

FRITZ

You did well tonight son.

KEVIN
 
Thanks Pop.

FRITZ

This is just the start.

KEVIN

Of course.

FRITZ

Tomorrow you’re back and working

harder than ever.

KEVIN

Yes sir.

FRITZ

Proud of you.

INT. THE VON ERICH RANCH - WEIGHT ROOM - EARLY MORNING

KEVIN finishes a set and lets out a guttural scream to push out the final rep.

INT. THE VON ERICH RANCH - KITCHEN / DINING ROOM - MORNING

DORIS, now in her 50s, cooks mountains of food for her giant sons and husband. THE BROTHERS roam the kitchen serving themselves before sitting to eat at the dining room table.

DAVID (20s), though younger than KEVIN, is the BIGGEST BROTHER. He only wears tighty whities as he scoops food onto his plate.

DORIS

Pants tomorrow please David. Thank you.

DAVID

I couldn’t find them Ma.

DORIS

They’re in the wash, heard of it?

MIKE, the youngest, is less athletic than his big brothers. He survives this family with his sense of humor. He eats as quickly as he can.
 
DORIS

Michael, breathe. You eat like a

starving mutt.

MIKE

(Mouth full of food)
If I don’t eat quickly they take

my food.

DAVID reaches over and steals a piece of MIKE’s bacon as he sits. MIKE slaps his hand away. Then KEVIN, straight up from the gym, grabs a piece.

DORIS

Manners. Please. Who raised you
animals?

FRITZ is at the head of the table with a smile on his face, basking in his family.

FRITZ

Mike, you need to hit the weights more kid, start filling out.

KEVIN and DAVID hate these comments.

DAVID

I’ll always have your back Mikey.

FRITZ

You won’t always be around.

DAVID

Mike’s fine pop.

FRITZ

Kid won’t be able to defend

himself being that scrawny.

MIKE

Well, I might be scrawny but I can still eat the most.

FRITZ

It’s not a joke. Kerry is about to become the family’s first Olympian. Kevin is the NWA Texas champion -
 
KEVIN

Pop, come on.

FRITZ

-	David is about to make his ring debut. You need to start thinking about what you’re going to be.

Now we all know Kerry’s my favorite, then Kev, then David then Mike, but that can always change. Everyone can work their way up or down.

FRITZ has a charming way of delivering this that makes it an accepted part of the family dynamic.

EXT. THE VON ERICH RANCH - EARLY MORNING

THE BOYS do their SUNDAY MORNING RANCH CHORES. DAVID and KEVIN stack hay. KEVIN looks out at MIKE who fixes a fence. FRITZ is standing over him giving him a hard time.

INT. THE VON ERICH RANCH - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - LATER

MIKE is waiting in line for the bathroom pounding on the door.

MIKE

Come on DAVID!! I’ve got to take a dump.

KEVIN passes by him in the hallway.


INT. THE VON ERICH RANCH - BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

DAVID is jerking off in the shower.

DAVID

Stop talking man, give me a

second.

INT. THE VON ERICH RANCH - MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

DORIS is getting ready for church. KEVIN enters.
 
DORIS

Good morning Kevin.

KEVIN

Morning Ma. Hey I’ve been thinking about something. Can I talk to you?

DORIS

Baby, that’s what your brothers

are for.

KEVIN

I know but -

DORIS

I need to keep getting ready.

KEVIN

Dad’s too tough on Mike Ma, you’ve got to talk to him -

DORIS

That’s between them. Now go get
ready, we’re leaving in fifteen

minutes.

EXT. CHURCH - DAY

The CONGREGATION gather in front of the church.

EVERYONE congratulates KEVIN for his recent victory. People try to meet FRITZ and welcome him to the CHURCH. As much as he does not want to go to church, he is there for his wife, there for his family. He is good at speaking with people in his community. They congratulate him on the success of WCCW, and the excitement of KERRY going to the Olympics.

DORIS is at the center of everything, she stands with the PASTOR greeting people as they file into church.

FRITZ looks at the doorway and braces himself.


INT. CHURCH - MOMENTS LATER

FRITZ, DORIS, KEVIN, DAVID and MIKE sit together. KEVIN watches his father look uncomfortable, swallowing his
 
pride. FRITZ looks straight up at the rafters, like he is LOOKING UP TO GOD...

CUT TO:


INT./EXT. KEVIN’S TRUCK - DAY

KEVIN and DAVID drive up to a small suburban house in a cul-de-sac, the neighborhood is pure seventies Americana.

A HIGHSCHOOL PROG ROCK BAND practices in an open garage. We see MIKE is the lead singer and guitar player. He is good, passionate. His big brothers watch on proud, they clap as the song finishes. MIKE says goodbye to his bandmates and jumps in the truck.

KEVIN

How was orchestra practice

Michael?

MIKE

It was good, thanks Mom... Man, I’m starving. Can we get a burger on the way?

KEVIN

There’s food in the cooler.

MIKE

I miss Kerry, he’d eat a burger

with me right now.

DAVID

I’ll eat a burger with you little brother.

MIKE

Come on Kev.

KEVIN

Alright, alright, but just drive

through.

INT. KEVIN'S TRUCK - LATER

ECU: MIKE FLIPS THE CASSETTE.
 
KEVIN, DAVID and MIKE devour burgers as they drive, windows down, music blaring.

EXT. RIVER - DAY

The BOYS fly into the river from an old rope swing. They swim, happy together. OTHER PEOPLE float down the river on inner tubes, drinking beer. A summer ritual.

INT. SPORTATORIUM - BACKSTAGE - LATER

KEVIN is dressed in tights and a sequined jacket with his Texas heavyweight belt around his waist, looking ring ready. He stands next to BILL MERCER in front of a cheap backdrop.

BILL MERCER

Welcome back ladies and gentlemen, I’ve got the newly crowned Texas heavyweight champion, Kevin Von Erich here and he is scheduled to fight in a tag team match later on tonight against Gino Hernandez and Bruiser Brody. But his partner is still a mystery.

KEVIN

That’s right Bill, first I want to say, Gino, you’ve been shooting your mouth off way way too long...

There is a slightly too long, awkward pause. KEVIN searches for the words.

KEVIN

And I’m here to take care of it. But boy oh boy, do I have a surprise for you tonight. Shall we try that again?

BILL MERCER

Yep, from the top... Welcome back ladies and gentlemen, I’ve got the newly crowned Texas heavyweight champion Kevin Von Erich here and he is scheduled to fight in a tag
 
team match later on tonight against Gino Hernandez and Bruiser Brody. But his partner is still a mystery.

BILL delivers his lines like a machine, perfect every time. KEVIN’S delivery is a bit mechanical. He loses his charming personality when he speaks into a microphone. This is KEVIN’S one FLAW in the world of wrestling, and with the emergence of the televised main event, it is a costly flaw.

The SOUND MAN walks in and adjusts a mic. THE CAMERA MAN resets. We reveal DAVID, in street clothes, watching from behind camera. He is trying not to laugh.

KEVIN

That’s right Bill, and I just want to say first that Gino has been shooting his mouth off way too much about me and my family, and tonight he’s going to get it. It’s not going to be all roses - Fuck.

KEVIN stalls again. The more he falters, the more nervous he gets.

KEVIN

David, I hear you. Stop.

DAVID

I didn’t say anything.

BILL MERCER

It’s ok. Let’s go again. Welcome back ladies and gentlemen, I’ve got the newly crowned Texas heavyweight champion Kevin Von Erich here and he is scheduled to fight in a tag team match later on tonight against Gino Hernandez and Bruiser Brody. But his partner is still a mystery.

KEVIN

That’s right Bill, I’ve got a big surprise to bring out for our home crowd tonight...
 
(Pause)

Something that’s going to make

them all very very happy, but
first I just want to say, that

Gino, you’ve been shooting y-y-
your mouth off, sh, sh, sh - god

damn it!

DAVID

Shooby dooby do.

KEVIN

You come try it then if it’s so

easy.

DAVID

Yeah, I mean, I’d love to but that will kind of ruin the surprise -

KEVIN

I know it will you big bastard,
you’re not helping. Just get out

of here.

DAVID loves to wind KEVIN up.


EXT. SPORTATORIUM - NIGHT

A truck speeds towards the glowing red light gleaming “SPORTATORIUM.” This is the first time we are seeing the exterior of our arena, a large shed-like structure in the shadow of the Dallas skyline. It doesn’t look like much, but this is wrestling Mecca... The Camera is in the back of a pick up truck with a bunch of YOUNG PEOPLE. The parking lot is packed. Excitement is in the air. The camera jumps out of the car with a GUY who runs to the long ticket window line. The camera moves off of him and finds a CLUSTER OF FANS drinking, while others are trying to get close to some WRESTLERS entering the back door. They fight through the groping crowds to get inside.

INT. THE SPORTATORIUM - BACK STAGE - NIGHT

KEVIN and DAVID talk to two other wrestlers, BRUISER BRODY

&	GINO HERNANDEZ, in their tights and robes, ready to go on.
 
BRUISER BRODY

I’ll have you in an arm bar, really sell it. Spin out, give me a knee, body slam, elbow drop, I’ll roll out, pick you up, shoot you to the corner, charge, you jump out and tag Kev.

KEVIN

I’ll go straight up on the top

rope, don’t give me too long -

GINO HERNANDEZ

I’ll come charging across the ring for the -

DAVID

And then the double drop kick -

BRUISER BRODY

Yep.

DAVID

And then the claw.

GINO HERNANDEZ

Can’t wait. Your pop’s been

coaching you on that one?

DAVID

A little bit.

BRUISER BRODY

Welcome to the show.

They all pat DAVID on the back.


INT. THE SPORTATORIUM RING	- MOMENTS LATER

Cut in mid-match as BRUISER BRODY gives DAVID a big boot to the head. DAVID gets up and they exchange blows. The climax plays out how they planned it backstage... DAVID and KEVIN put a double drop kick on BRODY, knocking him out of the ring. GINO gets up dazed and steps right into DAVID’S IRON CLAW - DAVID grips his right hand around the temple of GINO. GINO submits. The bell sounds. THE AUDIENCE IS ELATED. DAVID is impressive and powerful on his debut.
 
BILL MERCER(O.S)

And a kick out from Gino. David picks up Gino but he pushes him into the corner. Here comes Brody charging across the ring. He misses him, he misses him and comes all the way back over to the other side. Kevin’s getting up on the top rope. He knocks down Brody. The brothers line up a double drop kick. Blowing the roof off of this place. Can you hear these people? And here comes the Iron Claw, his father’s notorious signature move. Oh and he slaps it on Gino. Look at him. The pain is too much, Gino taps out. And the Von Erichs win. Look out NWA, David and Kevin Von Erich are here.

RING ANNOUNCER (O.S)

And the winners, David and Kevin

Von Erich!

FRITZ WATCHES ON FROM THE AISLE. HE SMILES, HE KNOW HE HAS SOMETHING SPECIAL ON HIS HANDS.

INT./EXT. SPORTATORIUM - LATE NIGHT

KEVIN and DAVID exit the backstage door after a match. The parking lot is mostly empty but for a few FANS. KEVIN signs autographs, he loves connecting with the fans. As they get away from the group, a young woman, PAM, approaches KEVIN.

PAM

Hi Kevin, can I get your
autograph?

KEVIN

Sure.

He signs a piece of paper.

PAM

Well don’t you want to ask me who to make it out to and all that?
 
KEVIN

Oh yeah, sure.

PAM

It’s Pam.

KEVIN

Okay Pam.

PAM

You’re supposed to say nice to

meet you Pam.

KEVIN

Sorry, yeah, nice to meet you Pam.

PAM

Nice to meet you too Kevin.

KEVIN

Do you want my brother to sign -

PAM

No. Just you.

KEVIN

Ok then.

They stand in awkward silence.

PAM

Your folks not teach you how to

ask questions?

KEVIN

Well, like what?

PAM

Like, who shall I make this autograph out to? Or do you want to have a drink with me some time, Pam?

KEVIN

You’re asking me out?

PAM

Make me feel a little worse while you’re at it.
 
She hits him on the arm.

KEVIN

Oh no, no, I’d love to go out with you, I’ve just never been asked before.

PAM

Well hopefully it will go well and then no one else will have the chance to ask you again.

Kevin laughs. He’s in.


INT. SPORTATORIUM OFFICES - DAY

FRITZ counts cash from Saturday night’s ticket sales. He divides up payments for each wrestler. He pays DAVID and KEVIN less than everyone else and slips the extra cash into a lock box. BILL enters.

FRITZ

Morning.

BILL MERCER

Morning.

BILL sits down.

BILL MERCER

David’s good.

FRITZ nods.

FRITZ

David’s good.

BILL MERCER

Saturday night’s ratings came in, our best numbers yet. I got a call from someone over at ESPN. They want to offer us a national slot on Saturday nights.

FRITZ

That’s great news. What does it

mean?
 
BILL MERCER

It’s a very good financial base. We’ll get ad revenue, we’ll draw bigger names passing through, but if we perform, and have a world heavyweight champion on our roster we could be the biggest promotion in wrestling.

FRITZ

Oh, we’ll have a world heavyweight champion, I can promise you that. Let’s move forward.

INT. BBQ PLACE - NIGHT

PAM and KEVIN are on a date. KEVIN signs an autograph on a napkin for a passing FAN.

PAM

You this famous everywhere?

KEVIN

Uh, not everywhere. They’re not
such big fans of us up in

Missouri.

PAM

You travel a lot?

KEVIN

Yeah, we go out on the road but we don’t need to as much now that our show is doing so well.

KEVIN eats massive amounts of meat, fried chicken, ribs.

PAM finds it endearing but she can only eat the pecan pie.
They laugh.

KEVIN takes a bit from a massive beef rib.

PAM

So, what do you want in life Kevin

Von Erich?

KEVIN

More ribs.
 
Pam laughs. He finishes chewing.

KEVIN

I want to be the world heavyweight champion.

PAM

Can you explain that to me, cause isn’t it all just fake?

The word FAKE is the most offensive word you can say to a wrestler. And she kind of knows it...

KEVIN

FAKE? No. Nothing is fake about

what we do -

PAM

Sorry. Prearranged? Written?

KEVIN

You move up in any industry based on your performances right? Based on how audiences or clients respond to you. A belt, like my Texas title, is a job promotion. The promoters keep moving you up and up and if you reach the top, you become world champ as an award, because you are the best based on your ability. It’s like an actor winning an Oscar. No one says that’s fake.

PAM

So, is that all you want?

KEVIN

Course not. I want to be with my

family. Be with my brothers.

PAM

That’s sweet. What do you like to do with your brothers?

KEVIN

Anything. Just being together we
can do anything. What about you?
 
PAM

I want kids. I want to have my own practice. I want a man who is ok with that.

KEVIN

Cool.

He just nods and chews.

PAM

So, would you be OK with that?

KEVIN

Damn right I am, we could be like one of those modern power couples. We can have our own ranch, everyone can come live with us, all my brothers and their families.

Pam laughs. It’s sweet, but not what she has in mind.

PAM

You have oldest brother syndrome.

You want to take care of everyone.

KEVIN

Maybe. I’m not the oldest though.
When I was five my big brother

Jack Jr. died.

PAM

My God, Kevin. I’m so sorry. I had no idea.

KEVIN

It’s alright. I mean it’s alright now. I don’t really think about him anymore.

PAM

What was that like?

KEVIN reflects on this, maybe for the first time.

KEVIN

I don’t know. It was strange as a kid; he just wasn’t there to play
 
with one day. So, I’m not the

oldest. I must have the second

oldest brother syndrome.

PAM watches KEVIN feel all sorts of pain he’s uncomfortable with. She gets up from the table and walks around to sit next to him. She hugs him. He doesn’t know what to do at first, he’s never received this kind of affection or empathy before.

PAM

I’m sorry.

After a moment he folds into her. They just hug. He tries to make a joke of it.

KEVIN

It’s a part of the family curse.

PAM

What’s that?

KEVIN

Oh, I’m just kidding. Haven’t you heard about the curse of the Von Erichs?

PAM

No.

KEVIN

It’s this silly story. Pop changed his name to Von Erich which was my Grand Ma’s name and I guess her family had all sorts of tragedy so when my brother died people started saying it was this curse. But that’s stupid, it was just bad luck.

PAM

Well, I don’t believe in curses,
and I don’t believe in luck. I

think we make our own luck.

KEVIN

You’re lucky then.
 
They laugh and, despite a bit of BBQ sauce on his mouth, have their first kiss.

INT. THE VON ERICH RANCH - NIGHT

KEVIN comes into the house, floating from his date. FRITZ sits in the living room, waiting up for him, celebrating with a drink, feeling uncharacteristically jubilant.

FRITZ

Kev?

KEVIN

Yeah pop.

FRITZ

Get in here. Sit down son.
Big news for you.

KEVIN sits down across from his father.

FRITZ

I’ve booked Harley Race to come to the Sportatorium. You’re going to fight the World Heavyweight Champion.

KEVIN

Pop, you for real?

FRITZ nods and KEVIN bounces out of his seat with excitement.

FRITZ

Your first match will be a non-title fight. But if you put a whoopin’ on him, and show the world who you are and what you can do, you will become the number one contender for the world heavyweight championship and get your title shot.

KEVIN

Thank you Pop, I’ll make you so
proud.

FRITZ
 
I’ve dreamed of having that belt in this house my whole career but the NWA never gave me the chance I deserved. I got close many times, but they always robbed me over at the last minute. So you have to take this opportunity. You can be the one to bring it home.

KEVIN

Yes sir.

CUT TO:


INT. TV STUDIO - NIGHT

World heavyweight champion HARLEY RACE holds his championship belt and speaks directly into camera.

HARLEY RACE

I	am the four-time World Heavyweight Champion, me, Harley Race. The real World Heavyweight Champion. Not any of this plastic nonsense that you all parade around with out there. You have all these guys walking around, talking loud about how they are the man. Ric Flair, Dusty Rhodes, Tommy Rich or one of your snot nosed Von Erich kids. Well, this belt is the only measure of who is the man. And that man is me. The World’s Heavyweight Champion, Harley Race.





INT. THE SPORTATORIUM - NIGHT

ON A MONITOR we see the TV broadcast of WCCW’s famous Saturday Night Show: The DRUMS, the bad graphics flying over the awkward picture of the globe, fading into a shot of the Sportatorium.

The camera pans around to find BILL MERCER sitting in front
 
of the WCCW backdrop. The DIRECTOR signals they are on air in 2, 1... BILL talks directly to camera.

BILL MERCER

Good evening ladies and gentlemen, welcome to an exciting night of World Class Championship Wrestling on ESPN for a momentous main event. NWA World Heavyweight Champion Harley Race comes to town to take on the Texas champion, Kevin Von Erich.

INT. THE SPORTITORIUM RING - NIGHT

KEVIN VON ERICH and The legendary HARLEY RACE are introduced in the ring to a packed house of screaming fans.

BILL MERCER (O.S.)

Here we go folks, you can feel the excitement here at the world famous sportatorium, right here in downtown Dallas Texas, as that man right there, local hero Kevin Von Erich faces his biggest challenge to date, four-time world champion, the indomitable Harley Race. What an occasion this is for the Von Erich Family, for the 3500 fans here in the building, and everyone watching at home, as we are broadcasting in 62 countries around the world. All eyes are on this contest. Now this is a non-title fight, the belt cannot change hands here tonight, but it is a tremendous opportunity for Kevin. If he can win, he would become the number one contender for the NWA world heavyweight title.

The two men lock up. HARLEY hits hard. KEVIN hits back.

Things get heated between them.

The color of the ring mat and the lighting have changed.

Everything is a little more colorful.
 
KEVIN has a good run of quick moves and overwhelms the world champion. But KEVIN hits HARLEY in the face and pisses him off. HARLEY gives KEVIN an unexpected LOW BLOW. KEVIN loses his breath.

HARLEY RACE

Let’s take a walk.

HARLEY tosses KEVIN hard over the top rope onto the floor. HARLEY comes down to the floor and delivers one of his masterful suplexes onto the concrete floor. KEVIN was not expecting that. KEVIN is stunned, he has never felt so much pain. He cannot move.

HARLEY climbs back in the ring and taunts the crowd more. THE REFEREE starts to count KEVIN out. 1 -- 2 -- 3... Time slows down. KEVIN is trying to get up but still cannot move.

THE CROWD IS SCREAMING FOR HIM TO GET UP. PAM watches from the crowd. She is worried. DAVID and FRITZ stand in the aisle, looking on anxiously. We can tell by the expression on their faces that this is not planned.

THE REFEREE continues to count. 6 -- 7... KEVIN uses all his might, gets to his knees... 8 -- 9... and pulls himself back into the ring just in time to avoid the COUNT OUT, only to be met by a giant boot to the ribs.

HARLEY picks up KEVIN and is about to put him into another suplex when KEVIN slips out, HARLEY turns and KEVIN delivers a hard kick to the jaw. It knocks HARLEY down. KEVIN bounces off the ropes and dives into a splash on HARLEY. The crowd erupts. KEVIN pins RACE, 1 -- 2 ---

HARLEY kicks out at 3. HARLEY knows he is in trouble so he tosses the REF who immediately disqualifies him. THE BELL sounds and the fans boo.

RING ANNOUNCER

The Winner by disqualification,

Kevin Von Erich.

HARLEY grabs a CHAIR from ringside and smashes KEVIN over the head with it. He does it again and again until... DAVID storms the ring. He lays a series of moves on HARLEY who falls out of the ring. The CROWD goes crazy. HARLEY grabs his belt and walks backwards to the dressing room, taunting the Von Erich Brothers as he goes.
 
KEVIN, back on his feet, grabs the MIC but is out of breath.

KEVIN

Harley Race... You coward...
Afraid I was going to beat you so you cheated?

KEVIN takes a long nervous pause. With a small, but course changing action, DAVID takes the MIC from KEVIN. DAVID has immediate charisma and shines on the MIC where KEVIN stumbles.

DAVID

Harley Race, we showed you tonight what we are made of. You came into our building, with our fans, and my brother here put a good old-fashioned Texas whoopin’ on you. You are the past, your days are numbered, we are the future of this sport. So keep running, high tail it out of here, but everyone sees you, and we’ll catch you, whether you are man enough to stop back through Dallas, or if we have to chase you down in Missouri, Kevin deserves his rematch and he will fight you anywhere anytime for a fair shot at that NWA world heavyweight title. You can’t mess with Texas and you can’t mess with the Von Erich boys.

The crowd erupts. FRITZ WATCHES DAVID TALK, ELATED BY THE POTENTIAL HE SEES. HE KNOWS THAT DAVID’S PERFORMANCE HERE IS OUTSHINING HIS BROTHER, HE KNOWS WHAT HE HAS TO DO.....

INT. THE SPORTATORIUM - BACK STAGE - NIGHT

KEVIN is icing his back. DAVID is with him, bandaging a cut on his forehead. FRITZ enters, he feels preoccupied. The boys wait for the verdict.

FRITZ

You were long getting up.
 
KEVIN

I’ve never hit the floor that

hard.

FRITZ

You got to take it and get up.

KEVIN

I know. He wasn’t supposed to

throw me out the ring. It caught
me off gaur. There was nothing I

could do, I physically couldn’t

move.

FRITZ

This is how they test you.

KEVIN

Did I do enough to get my rematch?

FRITZ

We’ll see what those rat bastards say. I’ll chase them.

(Turns to David)
David. Great on the mic son.

Really great. We’ll get you out on

the road. Get you some more

exposure.

DAVID nods, FRITZ leaves.

DAVID

Dad’s downplaying it cause he doesn’t want to get your hopes up Kev, but you were incredible.

KEVIN

Why didn’t you let me talk? You

should have let me talk.

DAVID

Sorry. I was trying to help.

KEVIN stares at the floor. He knows it didn’t go as well as it could have.

DAVID

Hey. Smile. You just beat the
 
world heavyweight champion.

This does make KEVIN smile.


EXT. OLYMPIC TRAINING FACILITY - DAY

KERRY VON ERICH, 20’s, is younger than David and Kevin, older than Mike. An ADONIS, he stands totally still, posed like a statue ready to throw the DISCUS. A SHOT FIRES. He spins around, and around and releases the discus. He knows immediately it’s a good throw. HIS COACHES, dressed in TEAM USA sweats, do too. KERRY has a huge smile that lights up a room.

They wait for the measurement to be signaled back from the field. VARIOUS ATHLETES practice their events around the facility. 100 meters, long jump, high jump etc.

COACH

65.5. Personal best Ker. Would of shattered your state record.

They clap, high five. KERRY, focused, sets up for his next throw. Driven to do better, to achieve greatness.

EXT. OLYMPIC TRAINING FACILITY - DAY

KERRY and his OLYMPIC TEAMMATES stretch on the field after a long day of training. Across the complex, A FRANTIC COACH runs out of the office and down the bleachers onto the field. He starts talking to other STAFF MEMBERS and a panic spreads around the camp.

ATHLETES standing near the COACHES catch wind of the news. Some just collapse on the ground. Some start to cry. KERRY looks over, knowing something is very wrong. He gets up and starts to walk with urgency towards the grieving athletes.

INT. THE VON ERICH RANCH - LIVING ROOM - EVENING

KEVIN, DAVID, MIKE, FRITZ and DORIS are watching PRESIDENT CARTER address the nation on TV.

PRESIDENT CARTER

In my judgement, what we are doing is preserving the principles and
 
equality of the Olympics, not destroying it. It is absolutely imperative that we and other nations who believe in freedom and who believe in human rights, let our voices be heard in an absolutely clear way and not add the imprimatur of approval to the Soviet Union and its government...

INT. THE VON ERICH RANCH - LIVING ROOM - EVENING

The family continues to watch the president’s speech on TV.

KEVIN feels devastated for his brother.

PRESIDENT CARTER (O.S.) ...While they have 105,000 heavily-armed invading forces in the freedom-loving, and innocent, and deeply religious country of Afghanistan. And I hope recognition

of a grateful nation will at least partially make up for the sacrifice that you'll have to make this summer in not going to Moscow for the Summer Olympics. I can't say at this moment what other nations will not go. Ours will not go.

FRITZ is crushed by the news. He clenches his jaw. To him, this feels bigger than a single event...

INT. BUS - DAY

PRESIDENT CARTER’S speech trails off as we see KERRY ride a greyhound bus home. America passing by outside the window.

INT. BUS - NIGHT

KERRY rides the bus overnight.
 


EXT. THE VON ERICH RANCH - DAY
 
KERRY walks down the long and isolated ranch driveway.

KEVIN, DAVID and MIKE hang a sign over the front porch at FRITZ’ direction - WELCOME HOME KERRY.

KERRY arrives home. The FAMILY embrace him with their condolences. FRITZ is visibly shaken. KERRY looks worried he let his father down. They shake hands.

KERRY

I’m sorry it didn’t work out Pop.

FRITZ

Me too son.

KERRY reunites with his BROTHERS. They hug, forming a huddle. Happy to be together.

EXT. THE VON ERICH RANCH - EVENING

SATURDAY AFTERNOON FAMILY GATHERING. The BOYS play football. FRITZ plays quarterback. KEVIN and MIKE play against KERRY and DAVID. IT GETS COMPETITIVE. KEVIN outruns KERRY and playfully taunts him. KERRY takes offense and pushes KEVIN. They scrap. The other brothers break it up.

FRITZ

Fastest in the family Kevin. None of you could ever catch him. Still got it son.

FRITZ, loving the aggression, eggs them on.

FRITZ

You’ve got to put him on his ass

before he breaks past you Kerry.

Next play, FRITZ throws a pass for MIKE and he drops it.

FRITZ yells at him. MIKE waves in acknowledgement.

FRITZ

Oof, Mike, you could’ve dove for

that one. You got to lay out for

that.

Across the grass, the football game gets more competitive.

KERRY lays a tackle on KEVIN. KEVIN bounces right back up.
Focused.
 
FRITZ

Yes Kerry. Now that’s a tackle my boy, that’s a tackle.

KEVIN and KERRY scrap but the other boys pull them apart.

It is all loving but competitive.

Next play, FRITZ throws a pass to MIKE but KERRY intercepts it and runs it back for a touchdown. FRITZ is glowing at his son’s athleticism.

FRITZ

That’s why you were the best

linebacker in the state Kerry,
Coach Royal called me from UT,

says, Fritz, why is the best

linebacker in the state watching

from the stands? Good job son.

EXT. THE VON ERICH RANCH - MAGIC HOUR

Bugs and dust hovering in the afternoon light. You can feel the warmth, both of the air and the family being together. They eat a feast.

PAM feels at home. She holds KEVIN’s hand under the table. They look into each other’s eyes, falling in love. MIKE is sweetly obsessed with PAM. No one has ever brought a girl home.

MIKE

Hey Pam, I can pour you some more lemonade or something?

PAM

Sure, thanks Mike.

He gets up and walks the jug of lemonade over and pours it for her. FRITZ leans over to KEVIN and speaks quietly.

FRITZ

You keep hold of her son. She’s a good one. You put that down and someone else will pick it up.

KEVIN

Yes sir.
 
KERRY

Man, I’ve been watching, the show looks great. Kev I was so proud watching you fight Harley.

KEVIN

Thanks.

KERRY

When’s your rematch?

KEVIN

Still waiting. We haven’t got the call yet.

He looks to FRITZ.

FRITZ

I’m working on it. It will happen.

MIKE

Ker, you notice the camera angles are all different now. It’s really cool right?

FRITZ

We’re talking about wrestling, not camera angles. Your brother fought the world champion on national TV, who gives a damn about camera angles?

DAVID bristles.

KERRY

And how’s the music coming Mikey?

PAM

Oh, what do you play Mike?

MIKE

Lots of things. Viola. Violin.

Piano. Some other instruments.

DORIS

Musical like his father.

All the boys look at DORIS, she’s had a glass of wine and is smirking.
 
MIKE

Dad’s musical?

They look down the other end of the table at FRITZ who almost looks embarrassed.

DORIS

When I met your father he was
classically trained on the

clarinet. He had a music
Scholarship to the University of

Texas but he turned it down to

play football at Southern

Methodist.

FRITZ

Decided there was no future in
music. I chose sport and I was

right.

FRITZ is embarrassed, playfully irritated at DORIS for telling them. She knows she has exposed his secret, she smirks.

DORIS

He used to play the most beautiful pieces for me when we first dated. He was such a well-rounded man, not like anyone else I’d ever met

-

FRITZ

Dotty please.

The boys love hearing this.

MIKE

Hey, I wanted to ask you guys,

I’ve got this quartet I’m a part
of from school, and we actually

have a gig.

DORIS

That’s great Michael, when is it?

MIKE

Well, it’s tonight. At UT Dallas.
 
DORIS

You’re too young to be setting

foot on a university campus on a

Saturday Night.

MIKE

Kevin went on a national tour at
17.

FRITZ

That was for work.

MIKE

This is work. We’re going to get

paid.

KEVIN

I can go with him. He can just play the gig and we’ll leave right after.

DORIS

The answer is no.

The BOYS and PAM all look at each other.


EXT. THE VON ERICH RANCH - NIGHT

All the lights are off. MIKE climbs out of his bedroom window. DAVID and KERRY catch him as he jumps from the roof.

They sneak to KEVIN’s truck without making a sound. PAM sits in the driver’s seat and puts it in neutral. KEVIN, MIKE, DAVID and KERRY push the truck down the driveway. They build up speed and jump into the flat bed. When the truck is far away enough from the house PAM turns on the engine and they drive off.

INT. COLLEGE HOUSE PARTY - NIGHT

MIKE’S prog rock band perform. The crowd love him. DAVID, KERRY, KEVIN and PAM drink beer and watch, proud.

CUT TO:

KERRY and DAVID do KEG stands, very drunk. KERRY rips his
 
shirt off and ties it around his head. GIRLS are falling all over him.

KIDS

One more stand! One more stand!
One more stand!

KERRY hands A KEG TAP to the closest GIRL, then does a KEG STAND, DAVID helps him get inverted. KERRY then does inverted push ups on the keg while a GIRL pours beer into his mouth.

KIDS

6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15

KEVIN and PAM watch, impressed, amused, but concerned.

PAM

He’s got an appetite for drinking.

KEVIN

Yeah Kerry can put ‘em back. Look at my beautiful brothers.
(Screams out)
Wooo!

KEVIN is a sweet drunk, he just gets a soft and happy.

PAM

Probably good he’s letting off

some steam.

KEVIN

So, what do you think? We’re a

lot.

PAM

I love your family Kevin.

PAM nuzzles in under his arm.


EXT./INT. KEVIN'S TRUCK - NIGHT

KEVIN and PAM sneak out of the party and climb into the truck. They are kissing passionately. She unbuckles his pants.

PAM
 
This OK?

KEVIN

Oh yeah.

Clothes clumsily start to come off.

KEVIN

Have you ever?

She laughs. He doesn’t respond.

She stops and is overcome by a moment of rage because she thinks he is judging her.

PAM

Would that be a problem?

KEVIN

Oh, no, no, no, not at all. Not at all.

PAM

What is it then?

KEVIN

I’ve just -

PAM

Never?

KEVIN

Not never never, just like, not -

PAM

Oh, Kevin Von Erich you sweet

thing.

They kiss and start to make love for the first time.


INT. THE SPORTATORIUM -OFFICES - NIGHT

FRITZ watches RIC FLAIR beat HARLEY RACE in a cage match for the world heavyweight title on TV. He is strangely calm. He has a plan.
 

EXT. THE VON ERICH RANCH - NEXT MORNING
 
Early Sunday morning ranch chores. KEVIN, KERRY, MIKE and DAVID dig post holes in the field. They are all painfully hung over. It is grueling work and the sun is hot already. KERRY throws up. They all burst out laughing. He looks around to see if FRITZ saw. He covers it up with dirt.

Across the field FRITZ works hard. A Deep anger is welling up in him. He makes a decision.

FRITZ walks across the field to the BOYS working.

FRITZ

Kerry, I don’t know if you’ve been thinking about wrestling, but in terms of raw talent and power, you show the most promise of all your brothers. I wouldn’t wish wrestling on any of you, I only wrestled to provide for you all and I always hoped you boys would choose another profession.

KEVIN and DAVID look at each other, smile and shake their heads. What a load of bullshit...

FRITZ

But the Olympics has been taken from you, the way professional football was taken from me and taken from Kevin too. The world is taking from us and I’m sick of it, I want to fight back and the more of us in it together the better. Kerry, I want you to join your brothers in the ring.

KERRY

OK.

FRITZ

It’s a grueling life, but it has given us all this. So, if you’re sure then I’ll give you everything I can to help you be the greatest wrestler in the world.

KERRY

I’m sure. I’d love that.
 
FRITZ

Good.

KEVIN and DAVID embrace KERRY. MIKE feels left out.

KEVIN

Let’s get you training little

brother.

INT. THE SPORTATORIUM - NIGHT

The Sportatorium is ruckus, packed to the rafters, an energy like we have not seen. THE BROTHERS WALK THROUGH THE BACK STAGE AREA all wearing sequined jackets.

Just as they are about to enter the arena,“TOM SAWYER” by RUSH kicks in on the loud speaker. FANS look around, surprised, excited. THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME MUSIC WAS USED FOR A WRESTLING ENTRANCE.

KERRY, KEVIN AND DAVID EMERGE FROM BEHIND THE CURTAIN. They walk down the aisle to the ring. The crowd are in a frenzy. WOMEN storm the aisle to touch the brothers. KERRY is nonchalant, sexy. He plants a kiss on ONE WOMAN and she faints.

The BROTHERS storm the ring and start an all-out brawl with their opponents, THE FABULOUS FREEBIRDS - MICHAEL HAYES, TERRY GORDY, and BUDDY ROBERTS. The pace is exhilarating,

DAVID

Freebirds, ever since you’ve
arrived in the WCCW, you’ve done

nothing but lie, bully and cheat
your way to victory. And we’re

sick of it. Now you’ve made this

about Georgia versus Texas and it
isn’t. It’s about filth versus

decency. And you know it. And

we’re here today to restore
 
justice and order to the wrestling federation that our father built with his own two hands. The hands that were passed down to us. The hands that will deliver the Iron Claw to you.

INT. THE SPORTATORIUM - NIGHT

And the challengers from Denton, Texas, weighing in with a combined weight of 690 pounds, Kevin, Kerry and David Von Erich.

RING ANNOUNCER (O.S.) The winner and new NWA world’s six-man tag team champions, Kevin, Kerry and David Von Erich!

FRITZ storms the ring to celebrate with his sons. MIKE, dressed in street clothes joins them. BILL gets in the ring with the MIC to interview the Brothers. TRUE ELATION, UNTIL.... FRITZ picks up the mic and with a crazed

intensity, looks directly into the TV camera.

FRITZ

Freebirds! Tonight, you saw the strength and resilience of this family. We’re sending a message to Sam Muchnick and every other
 
territory out there in the NWA, WCCW is the best in the business, the Von Erichs are the best in the business, and we are coming for you all.

The crowd erupts for the VON ERICHS.

BILL MERCER (O.S.) Wow, Fritz, calling out the man who runs the NWA by name on air is a bold and unprecedented move.

FRITZ

It’s necessary Bill. Because I
will

make it my life’s work to see to
it that David Von Erich will be

the next NWA world heavyweight

champion.

KEVIN is stunned by FRITZ. He tries to stay in character but * he is disoriented, his world just flipped.

FRITZ

And then each and every one of my sons, starting with Kevin, then Kerry, then Mike, all, one day, will lift the world heavyweight title because the Von Erichs are, and will forever be, the greatest family in the history of wrestling.

KEVIN looks over at DAVID who feels awkward he was just named as next in line to challenge. DAVID leans in.
