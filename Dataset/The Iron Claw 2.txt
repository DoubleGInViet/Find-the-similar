DAVID

I’m sure he didn’t mean me first.

KEVIN

Pop doesn’t make mistakes like

that.

FRITZ turns and catches them.

FRITZ

Is there a problem?
 
The BOYS shake their heads. They shift back to PUBLICLY CELEBRATING their new 6-man tag team championships.

INT. THE SPORTATORIUM - LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT

THE LOCKER ROOM IS EMPTY. DAVID, KEVIN and KERRY enter. TIME HAS PASSED. WE FEEL THE GRIND. THEY sit down in the dressing room, sweat-drenched, sore, and exhausted after another grueling match. Their hair is a little longer, costumes a little brighter. KERRY is covered in blood. KEVIN straps ice bags to both knees. DAVID’S back has seized up. He gets an injection to deal with the pain. He pops some pills.

FRITZ enters with news. He is buzzing.

FRITZ

Boys. I’ve got good news. We are finally getting a world heavyweight title shot with Ric Flair. And they want it to be you, David.

DAVID feels bad for KEVIN, but this is what he wants. He looks to KEVIN for some approval.

FRITZ

Don’t look to your brother. This
is your time. Your opportunity.

You have been chosen. You earned

it.

KEVIN can’t look at DAVID.

FRITZ

You’ll go on the road and feud with Flair in every territory in America over the next six months. Then you’ll go to Japan. You can’t be world champion unless you win over Japan. Then you’ll fight with Flair at Parade of Champions in May at Texas Stadium. Are you up for it?

DAVID

Of course I am.
 
FRITZ

I’ve waited my whole life to have the Von Erich name on that belt. We have had a couple of setbacks, but I can feel it, this is our time. If you perform, the title will be ours.

DAVID

I Love you Pop.

FRITZ

Love you too son.

FRITZ and DAVID come together and hug, a moment of rare affection. FRITZ turns to KERRY and KEVIN.

FRITZ

This wouldn’t be happening without the two of you. You’ve made your brother better and your collective effort has pushed him to the top. Keep it up out there. You never know when your opportunity will come.

FRITZ leaves. KERRY is ecstatic for DAVID. He runs over and picks his brother up giving him a bear hug and swinging him around.

KERRY

Fuck yeah David. FUCK, YEAH.

DAVID looks to KEVIN, concerned.



EXT. CHURCH - DAY

CHURCH BELLS RING. KEVIN and PAM leave the church JUST MARRIED. A small gathering of family and friends crowd the steps.

INT. TOWN HALL - WEDDING RECEPTION - DAY

KEVIN and PAM dance like goofs, totally free together. Everyone crowds around having a great time. KERRY takes DORIS by the hand and they jump onto the dance floor and
 
join.


INT. BATHROOM - LATER

KEVIN, joyful and drunk, walks into the bathroom and takes a piss at the urinal. Someone VOMITS in the stall.

KEVIN

Too much to drink already, it’s
still early. Who is that?

KEVIN peeks through the open stall door to see it is DAVID.

KEVIN

Shit brother, you alright?

DAVID

Yeah, just some stomach cramps,
I’ll be good.

KEVIN pushes open the door. DAVID gags, then vomits again.

There is BLOOD.

KEVIN

Jesus man. You got to see a

doctor.

DAVID

I’m fine.

KEVIN

You’re not fine.

DAVID

It’s just a bug I picked up on the road. Don’t worry.

KEVIN

Maybe you’re pushing too hard. You need some rest.

DAVID

I’m almost there.

KEVIN

You think it’s going to slow down if you become champion?
 
DAVID

I’m fine Kevin. Seriously. I’m

just sick today.

KEVIN

I don’t think you should go to

Japan next week.

KEVIN means it but they start to laugh. They know it’s a ridiculous idea.

DAVID

You’re stupid.

They gently slap box each other, laughing, sitting on the floor of a toilet cubicle.

KEVIN

Hey Dave, I just wanted to say, I didn’t take it so well, you jumping me and all.

DAVID

I understand.

KEVIN

I’ve been pretty angry, not at you, just at the situation, but I didn’t even want it that bad. I just love being out there with you guys. Nothing else really matters to me.

DAVID

Married two hours and already

losing your competitive edge.

KEVIN

Maybe. I’m pretty happy to focus

on my family though.

DAVID

Family?

KEVIN

Turns out this is a shotgun

wedding, just don’t tell anyone.

DAVID puts KEVIN in a loving headlock and messes up his
 
hair.

DAVID

You rat bastard. Good for you guys, God damn that makes me happy Kev. Come on, we got some dancing to do.

INT. WEDDING RECEPTION - DAY

DAVID, KEVIN, PAM, KERRY, and MIKE dance a TEXAS LINE DANCE. The wedding party cheer. FRITZ and DORIS watch.

DORIS

Look how lovely she looks when she puts a little effort into her appearance.

FRITZ

They are a great couple. Reminds
me of a couple I knew once. How

about we get out of here, Dotty.

DORIS

Well, I could use some air.

DORIS is having a hot flash. FRITZ takes her sweater off her shoulders. She loosens her collar.

FRITZ

We could take advantage of the
situation.

DORIS

No boys in the house. And I don’t have to worry about you getting me pregnant anymore, you big stud.

DORIS and FRITZ KISS. They look back at their sons having a wonderful time. The CAMERA PANS ACROSS THE BOYS’ FACES IN CU and comes to rest on DAVID.

EXT. THE VON ERICH RANCH - MORNING

KEVIN drives up the long ranch driveway towards the house. He sees a MAN leave the house and walk to A CAR he does not recognize. The CAR drives down the driveway passing KEVIN.
 
KEVIN sees the look in the MAN’S face. He knows something is wrong. KEVIN parks and runs into the house.

INT. THE VON ERICH RANCH - CONTINUOUS

KEVIN walks inside. It is quiet. He looks around for someone. At first it seems empty until he realizes FRITZ is sitting in the living room, completely still...

KEVIN

Pop?

FRITZ just shakes his head.

KEVIN

What is it?

FRITZ

David.

KEVIN knows. He sits down - this cannot be happening.

KEVIN

What happened?

FRITZ

He died in his hotel room in
Japan. It looks like he had a
ruptured intestine. We’ll know

more soon.

KEVIN

How does that happen?

Both men are shattered but show no pain.

They can hear DORIS walking around upstairs. FRITZ looks at the ceiling, frozen with fear, knowing he has to deliver the news to his wife.

INT. THE VON ERICH RANCH - DAY

KEVIN, numb, is dressed in a black suit waiting for the family to be ready. Amongst the flowers and food that have been sent to the house is a pile of recent unopened mail. A postcard catches his eye. He is pulled towards it. It is from Japan. A lump in his throat. He is afraid to read it.
 
But he does:

Kev, Sorry I sent this to the house, I couldn’t remember your new address. I miss you Brother, you got to come with me next time, it’s wild over here. Someone asked me for an autograph today because they thought I was you. Made me very happy. I’ll probably be home by the time you get this so this is stupid but just wanted to send. See you soon.

This is too much for KEVIN to bear. He slips it back into the pile.

INT. THE VON ERICH RANCH - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY

DORIS gets dressed for the funeral. A long sleeve BLACK DRESS, black gloves and a black veil. She looks at herself in the mirror. She digs deep to put on a strong face. She has cried for hours, has no tears left, pulling herself out of the hell of a lost child.

EXT. THE VON ERICH RANCH - FRONT PORCH - DAY

PAM sits with KEVIN, KERRY, and MIKE, all wearing sunglasses. DORIS and FRITZ walk outside.

FRITZ

Take those glasses off. No hiding. All of you. I don’t want to see any tears.

KEVIN takes off his glasses but can’t look at his parents. He can’t stomach the family rallying cry he knows is coming. He pushes down the pain and makes himself numb. PAM cannot believe what she is hearing.

FRITZ

The lord decided it was time for David to move on. We have to accept that. In his 25 years he lived 75 years’ worth of life. He never got the chance to be world champion here but he’ll be the world champion of the afterlife, that’s for sure.
 

INT. LIMO - DAY
 
The FAMILY travel together in a LIMO to the funeral. DEVASTATED FANS line the streets paying their respects to the family, waving TEXAS FLAGS and YELLOW ROSES, desperately trying to touch the car as it moves slowly through the procession. KEVIN starts to panic, he cracks the window and desperately tries to breathe some fresh air, trying to stay calm. He looks up at the news helicopter flying above.

CUT TO:


A HIGH ANGLE SHOT FROM THE HELICOPTER LOOKING DOWN TO REVEAL THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE TURNING OUT TO MOURN DAVID VON ERICH.

INT. THE VON ERICH RANCH - DAY

KEVIN lies like dead weight on DAVID’S BED, soaking up what is left of his brother’s scent. PAM finds him and peels him off the bed with all her might.

PAM

Come on Hon.

He struggles to sit up.

PAM

I’m here when you want to talk.

KEVIN

No. I’m good. I’m good.

EXT. THE VON ERICH RANCH - NIGHT

FRITZ and THE BOYS sit on the front porch drinking beer.

Everyone’s exhausted from the day, lost in their own heads.

FRITZ

It’s hard to see clearly in this dark moment, we cannot let this tragic moment define us. Our greatness will be measured by our response to adversity. Now, David’s title match against Ric Flair at parade of champions is a moment of a lifetime. We still
 
have a chance to bring the world

heavyweight championship home if

one of you will step up and take
over from David. Everything we

have ever worked for in the ring

is riding on this moment.

KEVIN is broken. Over his shoulder he sees a FIREFLY hovering in the dark. A second later it is gone. He wants to protect his brothers, he digs deep, he will bear the burden...

KEVIN

I’ll do it Dad. I can do it.


KERRY

I can do it too.

KEVIN looks up, surprised to see KERRY is eager, energetic, empowered by his father’s words. He wants it.

KEVIN

Kerry, I’ll do it.

KERRY

I’m ready. I want it.

KEVIN

You don’t have to, it’s my match
Kerry -

KERRY

No. I deserve it too.

FRITZ

Boys, boys, it’s a tough decision. You are the oldest Kev but Kerry has been getting the most attention lately.

KEVIN is in too much pain to fight it.

FRITZ

We’re going to flip a coin. It’s the only fair way to decide. Heads for Kerry. Tails for Kevin.

KEVIN AND KERRY STAND OFF. FRITZ flips the coin. It tumbles
 
into the night sky...

CUT TO:


INT. TEXAS STADIUM - PARADE OF CHAMPIONS - BACKSTAGE - DAY

The roar of 34,000 fans can be heard... The camera moves up to reveal KERRY, oiled up and ready to go. KERRY won the toss. KEVIN stands behind him in support. The entrance music plays and KERRY walks through the curtain, out into the stadium. KEVIN stays backstage and waits.

EXT. THE VON ERICH RANCH - DAY

Empty. Still. Haunted. In the distance we can hear the TV playing inside, BILL MERCER’S commentary of the Match.

INT. THE VON ERICH RANCH - DAY

DORIS watches THE MATCH on TV.

ON TV: both men try to toss each other with a hook, neither works, then KERRY gets FLAIR in a full nelson, and turns him over into a back slide and pins him, 1,2,3. The Bell sounds.

BILL MERCER (O.S.) Dreams do come true. Dreams do come true. Kerry Von Erich is the new heavyweight champion of the world, what a pleasure it is for me to say that.

Back to DORIS watching, she feels nothing. THE GHOST OF DAVID STANDS BEHIND HER, OUT OF FOCUS IN THE DOORWAY. She feels something behind her. She turns and looks. Nothing is there. She turns off the TV.

INT. THE VON ERICH RANCH - DINING ROOM - THAT NIGHT

The house is quiet. KEVIN walks through the dark hallway

and finds KERRY at the dining room table drinking, still

buzzing, staring at THE NWA WORLD HEAVYWEIGHT TITLE BELT.
 
KERRY

Hey, didn’t know you were still

here.

KEVIN

I was just helping Pop. I’m about to head home. How you doing?

KERRY

Having trouble coming down.

KEVIN

I bet.

They look at the BELT.

KERRY

I can’t believe it’s finally in

our family.

KEVIN

Yeah.

KERRY

I think I’m going to go for a ride or something.

KEVIN

Alright. Be careful.

(Beat)
Hey Ker, you were great today

brother.

KERRY

Thanks Kev.

KERRY leaves. KEVIN looks at THE NWA WORLD HEAVYWEIGHT BELT, the thing his family has coveted his whole life. He almost feels disdain. He doesn’t want it in the house, but it is mythical, it has a pull. KEVIN, in a trance, can’t help but get closer to it. He reaches out and touches the belt.

Outside, KERRY’S Harley Davidson fires up. It startles KEVIN, snapping him out of it.

FADE IN:
 
EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

KERRY RIDES HIS MOTORCYCLE DOWN AN EMPTY TEXAS HIGHWAY. THE BIKE GOES FASTER AND FASTER AND FASTER AND FASTER...

CUT TO:


INT. THE VON ERICH RANCH - EARLY MORNING

KERRY wakes in discomfort. He sits up and reveals he is scraped all over his body. He has been in some sort of accident.

KERRY takes several pain killers. He puts one aside, crushes it up and snorts it.

KERRY hobbles into the kitchen. He gets a bowl of cereal. We see that his right foot has been AMPUTATED, he now just has a BANDAGED STUMP.

INT. WAITING ROOM - DAY

KEVIN, PAM and the BABY approach a teller window. They hand over their driver’s licenses and the TELLER on the other side slides out a draft of the BIRTH CERTIFICATE.

TELLER

Is everything correct?

KEVIN reads the paper and makes a decision.

KEVIN

Actually, his last name will be

Adkisson. It’s my Birth name.

TELLER

Do you have your birth

certificate?

KEVIN

Yeah.

He slides it to her.

TELLER

Let me update it, I’ll be right

back.
 
The Woman goes back and makes copies. PAM is looking at KEVIN surprised.

PAM

You sure you want to do that?

KEVIN

No. But, I think I’ll feel safer
for him.

PAM

Kev, it’s got nothing to do with
the name.

KEVIN

I know. I’d just like to do this.

INT. THE SPORTATORIUM - RING - DAY

KEVIN is teaching MIKE technique in the ring. KEVIN is a good teacher. MIKE is trying but it looks UNNATURAL. KEVIN is generally patient but gets frustrated with MIKE for not being able to perform a simple hip toss.

KEVIN

Come on damn it!

MIKE

Sorry. I can’t get it.

KEVIN is tired, he composes himself, digs deep for some patience. He looks at MIKE. He doesn’t have it. He wants to send him home. But he doesn’t. He keeps pushing.

KEVIN

It’s fine Mikey. You’re doing
great. Let’s keep going.

INT. THE SPORTATORIUM - NIGHT

THE SPORTATORIUM IS HALF FULL. The ESPN camera teams have gone. It all feels very local again. KEVIN and MIKE wrestle in a tag team match. It lacks tempo and skill. MIKE is an insufficient replacement for DAVID. He should not be in the ring. MIKE does a series of drop kicks on each of the opponents. On the third drop kick, he lands awkwardly and HIS SHOULDER POPS OUT. The ref calls off the match as KEVIN
 
signals for the medical team.


INT. HOSPITAL - WAITING ROOM - DAY

FRITZ and KEVIN wait for MIKE to come out of surgery. A DOCTOR walks in.

KEVIN

Hey. How’d it go doc?

DOCTOR

Fritz, Kevin. We completed the surgery as planned. We repaired the shoulder, but it was trickier than we anticipated. Mike’s temperature skyrocketed, we worked hard to bring it down, but it was close to 107 for almost two hours. We believe he suffered toxic shock syndrome.

FRITZ

What does that mean?

DOCTOR

I’m sorry to say that Mike is in a coma.

KEVIN

What? How? It was a routine

shoulder surgery.

DOCTOR

It’s rare, but it happens. All we can do now is wait and pray he pulls through. I’m very sorry.

EXT. HOSPITAL - EARLY MORNING

KEVIN sits on the curb in front of the hospital. He’s been up all night. He’s tired, lost in thought, angry, overcome.

INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM - NIGHT

KEVIN walks down the hall, aimless, pacing.

KEVIN sits in the phone booth quietly, talking to PAM.
 
KEVIN

Why is this happening to us? Why

does it just keep happening?

PAM (O.S.)

Baby, stay with me, OK.

KEVIN

But it keeps happening. It’s

taking over.

PAM (O.S.)

It’s a terrible accident. Nothing more.

KEVIN

He shouldn’t have been in the ring.

PAM (O.S.)

It’s not your fault. If you want
to blame someone blame your

father. But it’s not your fault.

KEVIN

I should have stopped him.

PAM (O.S.)

What could you do Kevin? There is no getting through to that man.

KEVIN looks across the room at FRITZ, sitting alone.


INT. KEVIN AND PAM'S APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING

The Baby cries... KEVIN lays awake in bed, staring at the wall. PAM is dressed in vet scrubs standing over him with the BABY.

PAM

I’m sorry hon, I’m late for work
and I can’t get him to settle.

Will you take him for me?


KEVIN

I can’t?

PAM
 
What? Just take him till your mom gets here. I have to go.

KEVIN

I can’t.

KEVIN doesn’t want to touch the baby.

PAM

Kevin.

KEVIN

I’m sorry. It’s OK.

She passes him the crying BABY. KEVIN can’t get the baby to calm.

INT. HOSPITAL LOBBY - DAY

MIKE and KEVIN sit behind a folding table for a MAKESHIFT PRESS CONFERENCE. KEVIN is jubilant, so thankful his brother is OK that he is bursting.

KEVIN

Thank you all for coming. And
thank you all for your love and

support.

PRESS (O.S.)

So Mike are you feeling OK?

MIKE

Yuh.

KEVIN

We’re all just so excited our brother pulled through, shows how much of a fighter he is. After losing David it’s too much to think we almost lost Mike too.

MIKE struggles to speak. He is reaching.

MIKE

I’m moved my whole family is here, and with me through everything and...
 
His delivery suggests he sustained MILD BRAIN DAMAGE. KEVIN watches, worried. He stays positive, hoping this will pass.

MIKE

... That you all out there sent flowers. I’m thankful to everyone.

REPORTER

So what is the time frame for your return to the ring Mike?

FRITZ stands off to the side, out of view of the reporters, eyes steadily on his sons.

MIKE

I know I’ll be back. Um. Soon. Yeah.
Soon.

KEVIN

Mike’s a fighter more than people even realize. He’ll be back in the ring in no time.

INT. THE VON ERICH RANCH - NIGHT

A FAMILY DINNER... DORIS, FRITZ, KERRY, MIKE, KEVIN, PAM and THE BABY sit at the table. MIKE IS A ZOMBIE. They know something is wrong, but no one will say it. PAM and KEVIN make eye contact, heartbroken by MIKE’S condition. The hope it would pass is fading.

FRITZ EATS, HEAD DOWN. HE CAN’T LOOK AT HIS TWO BROKEN SONS.

KEVIN FEELS PARANOID. He feels something behind him. He looks over his shoulder and stares at an empty doorway leading to a long dark hallway. The baby starts to cry.

INT. THE SPORTATORIUM - NIGHT

KEVIN wrestles with his new, stand in Tag Team partner LANCE. KEVIN waits to be tagged back in, but LANCE doesn’t tag him. LANCE gloats, soaking up the fans, making the most of his moment. He is loving the attention. He doesn’t get the Von Erich way. KEVIN struggles to take part in the charade but pushes through, waiting to be tagged in. But LANCE doesn’t tag him in. KEVIN is forced to just watch this imposter finish the match by himself.
 
INT. THE SPORTATORIUM - NIGHT

KEVIN is the last person in the building. He sits alone in the locker room. He can’t bring himself to go home.

KEVIN walks through the dark empty hallways of the Sportatorium.

INT. THE SPORTATORIUM OFFICE - NIGHT

KEVIN pulls a blanket out of the desk drawer and goes to sleep on the floor.

EXT. THE VON ERICH RANCH - GYM - DAY

KERRY attaches a PROSTHETIC FOOT fitted into an old boot.


EXT. THE VON ERICH RANCH - DAY

Determined, KERRY hobbles around the fields getting used to his fake foot. He starts to jog and falls over. He gets up and keeps jogging. He is in severe pain. He lets out a primal scream.

INT. THE VON ERICH RANCH - DAY

MIKE stares at the watercolor painting. Doris brings him lunch.

DORIS

That’s the house I grew up in. I
painted it.

MIKE

Why didn’t you tell anyone?

DORIS

I had my reasons, but I can’t

remember them now.

MIKE

I’m scared Mom.

DORIS

God loves you Michael. There is
 
nothing to be scared of.

MIKE

I’m not David.

DORIS

What?

MIKE

Everyone wants me to be David, but

I can’t replace him.

DORIS thinks about this for a moment, but it’s too much to really confront.

INT. THE VON ERICH RANCH - MIKE AND KERRY’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

MIKE sits on his bed struggling to strum his guitar. It is clear his hands no longer work the same way. He is scared, frustrated, angry.

INT. THE VON ERICH RANCH - BATHROOM

MIKE takes a pill. He looks down at the bottle and takes another pill. Then another. And another. And another. And another... He has written a note that sits on the side of the sink:

I’m sorry if I hurt you, but I am going to a better place.


EXT. THE VON ERICH RANCH - WRESTLING RING - NIGHT

KEVIN and KERRY train in their back yard ring. KERRY is back on his feet working with KEVIN. KERRY grits his teeth and pushes through the pain. His boot comes off with his prosthetic in it.

KERRY

FUCK!!

KERRY falls over and just lays on his back.

KEVIN

I see how painful this is. It’s going to take time. We can’t rush this-
 
KERRY

No. I’m ready. I’m ready. Let’s go.

KERRY slips his leg back on. HE stands. The sheer pressure of his leg meeting the prosthetic is painful. It is hard for KEVIN to see.

KEVIN

Maybe God is trying to tell you to slow down. Maybe you should consider doing something else with your life?

KERRY

Why? So you’re the only brother
left in the ring? So you get all

Daddy’s attention. Fuck you.

KEVIN

I want you in the ring. It’s

impossible doing this by myself.

KERRY pushes KEVIN.

KERRY

Come on! Let’s keep going.

KEVIN

You can’t just hide this Kerry.

KERRY punches KEVIN in the side of the head with real force. KEVIN loses his cool and retaliates with a kick to KERRY’S chest. KERRY falls flat on his back, winded. KEVIN stands over him.

KEVIN

Come on, you want back in then get up! You want back in then get up! Get up!

KERRY jumps up and they lock up. KERRY’s leg holds up, he gets his strength back, he is determined. They push each other but neither relents...

In the distance, in the field, we see a flashlight.
 


EXT. THE VON ERICH RANCH - CONTINUOUS
 
MIKE walks through a field in the middle of the night holding a sleeping bag and a flashlight. He is determined and decided. He is not coming back.

EXT. THE VON ERICH RANCH - DAY

A small search party including KEVIN, KERRY and FRITZ canvasses the land looking for MIKE. They find him.

INT. THE VON ERICH RANCH - MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

DORIS stands in her underwear. She stares at the SAME BLACK FUNERAL DRESS laid out on the bed. She starts to shake. She physically cannot put it on again. PAM knocks and enters.

PAM

Doris, honey, we should go.

PAM sees DORIS has broken. She takes her hand and tries to comfort her.

DORIS

I can’t put it on, everyone will

recognize it, I can’t, I can’t. I

need a new dress.

PAM

Honey, people here love you, they don’t care. We all love you Doris. Come on.

PAM hugs her. They cry together.


EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

DORIS walks up to a small podium wearing the same BLACK DRESS and VEIL she wore to DAVID’s funeral. She addresses the attendees.

DORIS

Today we are here to lay to rest our son Michael Brett Adkisson, my sweet, beautiful boy. Kind, funny and truly good...

PAM is exhausted by the party line. She looks over at KERRY
 
and KEVIN watching on, no sadness left, just numb.


EXT. CEMETERY - LATER

After the service, people gather and talk. PAM approaches KEVIN. They speak quietly, close together so no one hears.

PAM

You going to come home tonight?

KEVIN

I’m not sure.

PAM

I know how painful this is, I do. I’m trying to be patient but this doesn’t work for me.

KEVIN

I’m sorry. I know.

PAM

Just come home. Just be with us.

PAM tries to get through to him.

PAM

Hey.

KEVIN

(Gesturing to the BABY)

I don’t want him to get it. I

don’t want you guys to catch it.

PAM

Kevin. You can’t be serious?

She touches his face but he flinches. He is losing it...


INT. THE SPORTATORIUM - NIGHT

KEVIN bounces off the ropes, building up speed, crisscrossing the ring, back and forth, back and forth, furious, possessed.

KEVIN does push-ups. Over and over and over again. ALONE in the empty Sportatorium. Machine.
 
KEVIN (V.O.)

Ever since I was a child people said my family was cursed. It never seemed to bother my father. He said if we were the toughest, the strongest, the most successful nothing would ever hurt us. I believed him. We all did. We loved our father and we loved wrestling.

KEVIN working out by himself is intercut with images of FRITZ and THE BROTHERS all training in the same ring together.

CUT TO:

KEVIN sits alone in the ring, sweating, breathing heavy.

Determined...

CUT TO:


INT. THE SPORTITORIUM - BACK STAGE

KEVIN waits backstage ready for a match. He looks different - bigger, more focused, fiercer.

RING ANNOUNCER (O.S.) This match is scheduled for one fall, and is for the NWA world Heavyweight Championship... First, entering the ring, the champion, Ric Flair.


CUT TO:


ON TV MONITOR: BILL MERCER INTERVIEWS RIC FLAIR WHO SPEAKS DIRECTLY TO CAMERA.

BILL MERCER

Now, Ric, there's been a lot of talk that you've been resisting coming down to the Sportatorium to defend your title against Kevin Von Erich.
 
RIC FLAIR

It is so hard to be humble when you're looking like Ric Flair. You see the difference between me and a lot of these so-called big-time stars is that I'm custom made from head to toe. That's why I've got the biggest house, on the biggest hill on the biggest side of town. That's why this sports coat costs $800. And I don't know what that costs! I'd be ashamed to wear it! That's why I've got on Lizard shoes and a Rolex watch, and I've got a limousine out there, a mile long with 25 women in it. Just dying for me to go, wooh. Now, let's get to the less pretty facts of life. Kevin, your daddy got together with the powers that be and ordered me back down here to Dallas, a nothing-happenin' second rate sports community. I am the World's Heavyweight Champion because I am the greatest wrestler alive today. The toughest wrestler alive today. I have bled and sweat for this title and no daddy's boy is going to take that from me. This is professional wrestling. It is the most grueling of all professional sports. I've been stabbed, hit by chairs, beat up by everybody. I don't cry. I don't complain. I carry on. But the bottom line is...

BILL MERCER

You’re denying...

RIC FLAIR

I am talking right now. Hey, listen to me. Listen to me. I'll tell you what, you like talking to me on the show. You'll listen to me talk while I'm out here. The bottom line is, if you're a man,
 
you take the ups and downs. If you're a real man, you'll never go down. You'll just stay up. That's why I am the World's Heavyweight Champion. And I can go through Kevin Von Erich, or any Von Erich on the worst day of my life. Whoo. Whoo. Whoooo. Walk the aisle, daddy's boy! Walk the aisle!

INT THE SPORTATORIUM - NIGHT

THE SPORTATORIUM IS ONCE AGAIN FULL, LIKE THE GOOD OLD DAYS.

RIC FLAIR parades around the ring, his famous WHOOOOO echoing through the building. He takes off his elaborate robe to reveal the new, bigger, shinier world heavyweight title belt.

RING ANNOUNCER (O.S.) And the challenger, your very own, KEVIN VON ERICH.

KEVIN charges to the ring - no music, no parade, all business. THE CROWD goes crazy, grabbing at him, but he doesn’t stop to acknowledge them.

KEVIN jumps into the ring and attacks RIC FLAIR. He is ferocious. Shocking. KEVIN LETS OUT ALL OF HIS RAGE ON THE WORLD CHAMPION. The match is brutal and only escalates. KEVIN kicks FLAIR in the head and connects above his eye.

BLOOD DRIPS DOWN FLAIR’S FACE.

KEVIN puts the IRON CLAW on FLAIR. The crowd erupts and cheers him on. FLAIR falls to his knees and after a moment inches himself to the edge of the ring so he can grab hold of the ropes. The REF tells KEVIN to release. (The rule is you must release a submission hold when your opponent grabs the ropes.) But KEVIN refuses. He digs deeper and harder on FLAIR’S forehead. Blood pouring out over his hand, FLAIR’S face unrecognizable.

The REF warns KEVIN again to let go. He doesn’t. KEVIN just shouts in FLAIR’S face. The crowd is losing energy now. They are not sure what to make of this HORROR SHOW. The REF offers one final warning, but KEVIN can no longer hear him.
 
He has lost it. The referee rings the bell.

RING ANNOUNCER

The winner, by disqualification,
and still NWA World Heavyweight

Champion, Ric Flair. Kevin Von

Erich has been disqualified.

The crowd boos. TWO other officials are now in the ring trying to pull KEVIN off of FLAIR. But KEVIN just screams, it feels like AN EXORCISM - an absolute release of years of pent-up anger.

FRITZ and KERRY run to the ring and get involved. They finally rip KEVIN away. He pushes them off too. He’s like a wild animal. They contain him and carry him out of the ring.

INT. SPORTATORIUM - LOCKER ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

KEVIN sits staring at the floor. He is still. Calm. Almost serene. KERRY sits by his side. FRITZ sits across from them, furious, fuming.

KERRY

What happened?

KEVIN

I don’t know.

KEVIN is not talking about the match - a fog has lifted.

RIC FLAIR comes into the locker room, covered in blood, laughing. The BIG GOLD BELT around his waist.

RIC FLAIR

Oh, Kevin, oh man, you are crazy. You are one crazy son of a bitch. I mean I always thought you were a little soft but baby you got it.

I’ll give you a rematch any day, Christ. Let’s get a drink. Where can we get fucked up around here.

KEVIN

No. I’m good thanks.

RIC FLAIR
 
Alright well you change your mind

you let me know, I’ll be down at

the Holiday Inn.

FRITZ looks at the belt. Disgusted it’s not in his possession. He gets up and taps KERRY on the shoulder.

FRITZ

Come on son.

FRITZ and KERRY walk out. KEVIN is left alone. He looks down at his hand, his blood covered Iron Claw. After a moment he laughs to himself. He can see clearly now...

EXT. KEVIN AND PAM'S APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING

KEVIN approaches his apartment. He knocks on his own front door. PAM opens it. She is on the phone, holding the BABY. The dog runs out and jumps up on KEVIN. PAM walks back inside. KEVIN steps in. She hands over the BABY while she finishes talking on the phone. He overcomes a moment of hesitation and takes the BABY, looks at him, and holds him tight once again. PAM hangs up the phone.

FADE IN:


EXT. SCHOOL - DAY

KEVIN picks up his TWO SONS, now FIVE and SIX from school. They run to him and give him a hug. He scoops them up and carries them to the car.

INT. KEVIN AND PAM'S APARTMENT - EVENING

KEVIN prepares dinner to his TWO SONS. He almost trips on the dog, then a football. The kitchen is tiny. They have outgrown their home. He is frustrated, but sits and eats with the kids, loving their company. PAM arrives home in her scrubs, exhausted. The dogs jump up on her. She kisses her three boys on the head.

KEVIN

How was your day?

PAM

Long. You?
 
KEVIN

Fine.

They look around the crowded tiny apartment. It’s unsustainable.

KEVIN

We need to make a change.

PAM

We need a bigger boat.

INT. THE SPORTATORIUM - NIGHT

KEVIN is now the boss, dressed in khakis and a button down

-	OLDER, WISER, WORN. KEVIN is rooting through the FINANCIAL RECORDS. He comes across something that does not make sense. He cross references to the previous year. And the year before that.

INT. THE SPORTATORIUM - NIGHT

Bill interrupts.

BILL MERCER (O.S.)

So what did you decide Boss?

WCCW has downsized. It is just KEVIN and BILL in the office.

KEVIN

I think we need to cut down again and move to one show a week. Two shows is still too many. We can get the guys touring during the week and then bring them home for the Saturday night show.

BILL MERCER

I think it’s painful, but smart. The numbers just haven’t been there since Kerry went to the WWF. Jerry called again this morning, it’s a good offer you should think about it.

Like his father before him, KEVIN stands in the floor to
 
ceiling window looking down at wrestlers training in the empty Sportatorium.

INT. THE VON ERICH RANCH - DAY

KEVIN’S BOYS sit on the floor in front of the TV watching their uncle KERRY wrestle in the WWF against MR PERFECT for the INTERCONTINENTAL CHAMPIONSHIP. He looks better than ever. KEVIN and FRITZ sit on the couch. KEVIN builds up the nerve to confront his father.

KEVIN

Hey Pop, so we have an offer on

the table from Jerry Jarret. He

wants to buy us out.

FRITZ

Son, don’t you even think for a second about selling the company.

KEVIN

I need to think about my family
Dad. I’m almost broke. I need to

do what’s best for the kids. For
our future. We need a house, we

can’t fit in that apartment

anymore.

FRITZ

If you sell, you can forget about stepping through these doors again. Damn well almost forty years old and still can’t take care of yourself -

KEVIN is furious.

KEVIN

I’ve been through the books and things don’t add up. I didn’t make nearly what it says I did.

FRITZ

I did what was right all along. You think living here was a free ride? Don’t you dare question me.
 
Just then, ON TV the climax of the match happens. They stop talking and watch on as KERRY beats MR PERFECT. The BOYS and FRITZ jump up and celebrate. But KEVIN is seething. FRITZ turns back to him.

FRITZ

Atta boy Kerry. That’s how you do it. Look at your uncle boys.

KEVIN doesn’t respond. But he knows what he will do.


EXT. THE VON ERICH RANCH - DUSK

The Ranch at last light on a chilly winter night. The glow of Christmas inside. KEVIN and PAM are there with DORIS and FRITZ. KERRY arrives home for Christmas to A HERO RETURNS.

FRITZ

Hey! Welcome home champ. We’ve
been watching every match on the

TV.

KERRY

Thanks Pop. Guys, this is Tania.

TANIA, KERRY’S new girlfriend, is with him. They are both drunk and maybe high. TANIA is overly aggressive in hugging each member of the family.

TANIA

It’s so nice to meet you all.

FRITZ

Let me get a look at you. You look strong son. WWF Intercontinental Champion, second biggest title in wrestling now that your brother ruined our promotion. I knew it was time to retire when I did.

KEVIN and PAM share a glance in disbelief at FRITZ’s rant.

TANIA

Kerry can you get me a drink

honey.

KERRY goes to the Kitchen to grab beer from the fridge.
 
KERRY (O.S.)

Oh, Dad, Dad, I got something for you for Christmas, but I can’t wait. I really want to give it to you now. Is that OK?

DORIS

Kerry, wait till Christmas

morning. Don’t be silly.

KERRY comes back in and gives a beer to TANIA and drinks another. Now everyone realizes he’s drunk. FRITZ is upset.

KERRY

It’s just so good. And Tania and I are going to Mexico for Christmas.

FRITZ

I thought you were home for
Christmas.

KERRY

I am, this is Christmas. We just
got a great deal for a Christmas
day flight to Mexico and we need

some rest. I’ve been hitting it

hard out there, you know.

KERRY digs through his bag and pulls out a GIFT.

KERRY

Please take it now, Dad. Please.

KERRY is so eager, like a child looking for approval. FRITZ reluctantly unwraps it. It is a beautiful REVOLVER.

KERRY

It’s a Smith and Wesson .357 50th anniversary! What do you think?

FRITZ

It’s great son, thank you.

FRITZ puts the gun in the living room GUN CASE.

KERRY

Don’t do that. Let’s shoot it now.

FRITZ
 
I don’t want to shoot it now.

KERRY

You always shoot a gun when you

get it.

FRITZ

I don’t want to shoot it, Kerry.

KERRY

Why the fuck not?

DORIS

Kerry! What is wrong with you?

KERRY

Me? What’s wrong with him?

FRITZ

Watch it son. You’ve brought company to the house, and we don’t want to be rude. Just settle down, and we can have a nice dinner that your mother worked hard to prepare.

KERRY

Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay.

FRITZ

Now come tell me, when are you getting your world title shot over there? I see your old tag team partner Hellwig’s holding, that guy’s got nothing on you, never has.

KERRY

Soon Pop, soon.

KERRY goes to the kitchen to grab another beer. KEVIN follows.

KEVIN

Hey!

KERRY

Hey! Sorry brother, I’m excited to be home.
 
They hug. A CHRISTMAS ALBUM plays from the living room.

KERRY

You look good.

KEVIN

You too.

KEVIN looks at him hard, there is something missing behind KERRY’S eyes.

KERRY

Stop it.

KERRY cracks three beers and hands one to KEVIN. They cheers and sip.

KEVIN

You OK?

KERRY

Never been better man.

INT. KEVIN AND PAM’S HOUSE - NIGHT

THE PHONE RINGS. KEVIN wakes and picks up before it can wake the house.

KEVIN

Hello?

KERRY (O.S.)

Oh good, I wasn’t sure you’d be

up.

KEVIN

I’m up, I’m up. What’s going on

Ker? Where are you?

INT. MOTEL - NIGHT

KERRY sits on the edge of the bed. He’s drunk, high.

INTERCUT:

KERRY

I’m back in Dallas. In a hotel.
 
KEVIN

You Ok?

KERRY

I’m Ok, course I’m OK.

KEVIN

Hey, why didn’t you tell us you
lost the belt. We could of been

there for you.

KERRY (O.S.)

I don’t know. Didn’t think about

it.

KEVIN just shakes his head. KERRY starts to cry.

KEVIN

Kerry?

KERRY (O.S.)

I’m scared man. I’m out of

control.

KEVIN

You’ve got to get some help.

KERRY

I’m in pain man, I’m in pain all the time. I’m fucking deformed. It takes so much to hide it -

KEVIN

It doesn’t show in the ring.

KERRY

I’m not getting a new contract. They’re sticking me in house shows from now on. They don’t want me anymore. I’ve got nowhere to go. I’ve got no one.

KEVIN

Where’s Tania?

KERRY

Who?

KEVIN
 
Tania.

KERRY

That wasn’t anything.

KEVIN doesn’t know what to say.

KERRY

I need someone, I need family.

KEVIN

Come here. Stay with us.

KERRY

I can’t. Your boys can’t see me

like this.

KEVIN

Let’s go get some breakfast or something. Or meet me at home. Mom can cook us up some pancakes.

KERRY

I just want it all to end.

KEVIN

No you don’t. You don’t mean that.

KERRY

I do. I’m alone. All alone.

KEVIN is losing patience.

KEVIN

You got us.

KERRY

I’m a piece of shit. I’m fucking
cursed. I want to die.

KEVIN

How are you going to say that to
me, after everything?

KERRY

It’s in me. It’s taken over.

This hits a nerve. Outside the sun rises. KEVIN digs deep - calms down.
 
KEVIN

Kerry, just tell me where you are and I’ll come get you.

KERRY hangs up. KEVIN thinks for a moment, then calls home.

FRITZ (O.S.)

Hello.

KEVIN

Dad, Dad. Sorry for the early

call.

FRITZ (O.S.)

It’s OK. I’m heading out to do

some work.

KEVIN

Where’s Mom?

FRITZ (O.S.)

Sleeping.


KEVIN

Look, I just spoke to Kerry. He’s in a pretty bad state. I’m worried about him. I’m going to come out there. We need to figure out how to help him -

FRITZ (O.S.)

I’m working Kevin. I don’t have
time for this. You boys need to

work it out between yourselves.


KEVIN

Just look out for him Dad. I’ll be out there as soon as I can.

FRITZ hangs up.


INT. KEVIN'S TRUCK / EXT. THE VON ERICH RANCH - MORNING

KEVIN drives out to the ranch. He sees his father working in the field. He looks towards the house and sees a rental car parked strangely on the front lawn. The front door to
 
the house is wide open. KEVIN gets out of his truck and walks up to the rental car. Nothing inside. He walks towards the house, steps onto the porch, and is about to enter through the door when a GUN SHOT GOES OFF. HE freezes. Looks around. He starts to search when he sees KERRY, laying limp under the tree they called CHUCK HOWLEY.

KEVIN runs to his brother and finds him laying limp, a bloody mess, gun shot through the chest. The gun he got his father for Christmas is the weapon.

KEVIN

NO!!

KEVIN turns to see FRITZ lumbering across the field towards them. KEVIN is overcome by rage. He rushes FRITZ and tackles him knocking him flat on his back. FATHER AND SON FINALLY FIGHT.

KEVIN

I told you to stop him, to look out for him. You didn’t take care of him, you didn’t take care of any of them.

FRITZ, still strong as an OX, rolls KEVIN over.

FRITZ

He called you and you didn’t help him. You killed Kerry, you took my favorite son from me.

KEVIN

You were here, you could have

stopped him.

FRITZ

You coward, blaming me. Always blaming me, never looking at yourself. If you were brave like your brothers, you’d kill yourself too.

KEVIN, with a surge of rage overturns the giant FRITZ VON ERICH and slams him down. KEVIN strangles FRITZ for a long moment, seeming like he won’t ever let go. FRITZ struggles to breathe and submits. Just as FRITZ is about to run out of air, KEVIN let’s go. FRITZ lays still, breathing heavy.
 
Defeated.

KEVIN picks up KERRY and walks away. FRITZ sits up and stares at the blood and the gun on the grass.

INT. THE VON ERICH RANCH - DINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

KERRY’S SUICIDE NOTE IS IN PLACE OF THE GUN:

I don’t know what is on the other side, but I can’t be here anymore. Tonight I walk with my brothers.

KEVIN puts KERRY’S BODY on the dining room table. KEVIN looks down at another lost brother. He kisses his mouth.

KEVIN

I love you Kerry.

CUT TO:


EXT. THE VON ERICH RANCH - MAGIC HOUR

THE CAMERA floats through the field as KERRY’S SOUL walks. He looks down and sees his foot is back. He jumps up and down on it, happy.

CUT TO:


EXT. RIVER - DUSK

KERRY sits in a small boat drifting across the water. A FIREFLY guides him. He turns a corner revealing a DOCK, the same dock where they swam as kids. MIKE and DAVID sit, waiting for him.

KERRY

Brothers.

DAVID/MIKEY

Hey brother.

CUT TO:

KERRY steps out of the boat and onto the dock. They hug and kiss each other on the cheeks. Each hug is tender, physical and loving and gentle, unlike anything in their life.
 
MIKE is healthy with long hair wearing a pink bandana, guitar strapped over his back. He looks like a 70s rock star.

KERRY

Mikey.

DAVID towers even taller, looking his best, a strapping cowboy. He wears a massive GOLD CHAMPIONSHIP BELT.

KERRY

World Champion of the afterlife.
Dad said you would be.

DAVID

Finally.

KERRY

Where’s Jack Jr?

The BROTHERS gesture towards the FIREFLY. The firefly disappears and then KERRY feels a tap on his back. He turns to look down at a sweet scruffy little boy, around 6. This is JACK JR.

KERRY

I guess you’re my oldest brother
Jackie.

KERRY picks him up. He is pure and gentle sweetness.

KERRY

Good to meet you.

The FOUR brothers huddle together. Reunited.


INT. THE VON ERICH RANCH - CONTINUOUS

KEVIN sits at the table, alone, holding KERRY’s hand, looking out the window, comforted by the thought of them all being together.

INT. THE SPORTATORIUM - OFFICES - DAY

The Sportatorium is completely empty. KEVIN signs over the business to a wrestling promoter, JERRY.
 
JERRY

Thanks Kevin. I’d love for you to stay on wrestling if you want.

KEVIN

I appreciate it. I could use the

extra work.

JERRY

Hey, just so you know, your daddy called me out to the ranch. Tried to intimidate me out of buying this from you.

KEVIN just laughs. Shakes his head.

KEVIN

He never stops. Glad it didn’t

work.

They look around the building.

JERRY

I’m not going to be using the Sportatorium so you might want to get out of your lease. Though I don’t know what else they can use this place for.

KEVIN

Yeah.

JERRY steps away. KEVIN takes one last look at the empty arena.

KEVIN

See ya old pal.

INT. THE VON ERICH RANCH - EVENING

THE HOUSE FEELS COLD, DARK, EMPTY. FRITZ arrives home from a day of working in the fields. The lights are off, the house feels different.

FRITZ

Doris?

DORIS (O.S.)
 
I’m in here.

He walks through to the kitchen to find her painting. He has never seen this in their 45 years together.

FRITZ

What are you doing?

DORIS

Painting.

FRITZ

What’s for dinner?

DORIS

I didn’t make anything. I’m not

hungry.

FRITZ sits down across from her. The couple sit together in silence.

EXT./INT. KEVIN AND PAM'S HOUSE - DAY

A NEW DAY...KEVIN and PAM lay in bed entwined. PAM is heavily pregnant. Dogs and cats all around. All love. KEVIN whispers to her belly, trying not to wake the kids.

The BOYS burst into the room and jump on their parents.

PAM

Careful, careful.

SON

I’m hungry, I want pancakes.

OTHER SON

Yeah pancakes.

PAM

How about a good morning?

BOYS

Good morning.

KEVIN scoops them up into a power slam. The boys play wrestle on the bed.
 
EXT. KEVIN AND PAM’S HOUSE - DAY

A beautiful afternoon in the back yard. KEVIN watches his SONS play football like the uncles they didn’t get to know. It fills him with joy but also breaks his heart. He is boiling over with emotion and finally, for the first time, KEVIN begins to cry. His BOYS notice. They stop playing and walk over to him, confused.

SON

You OK dad?

KEVIN

I’m sorry. I’m sorry boys, you shouldn’t see this. A man doesn’t cry, I’m sorry.

SON

It’s OK dad, really it’s OK. You
can cry. Everyone cries.

OTHER SON

Yeah, what are you talking about, we cry all the time.

The BOYS get on either side of him and hug him. He sobs * harder, letting it all out. The BOYS are naturally * affectionate and don’t hesitate to show him warmth.

SON

Why do you think you’re sad?

KEVIN

I guess cause I used to be a brother, and now I’m not a brother anymore.

SON

Oh. Well, we’ll be your brothers,

Dad.

OTHER SON

Yeah, we’ll be your brothers Dad.

The BOYS and KEVIN hug. He holds them tight.

KEVIN

Thanks boys. Thank you.
 
KEVIN gives them each a kiss on the cheek. He looks at them. He feels love and feels loved. Something lifts. KEVIN and the BOYS get up and start playing football together. The camera rises up. PAM walks out into the grass with the dogs to join them. The camera keeps rising to reveal the beautiful land where they now live. It is humble and idyllic, full of warmth, love, and possibility. The camera continues to rise up and up and up.

CUT TO BLACK.
