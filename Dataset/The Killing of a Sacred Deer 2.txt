MARTIN
Can't you get away for a couple of hours?

STEVEN
I'm afraid not. Some other time.

MARTIN
My mother will be upset. I'll tell you a secret, but don't tell her I told you. I think she likes you. I mean she's attracted to you. She says that's not true, but I'm sure of it. And to be honest, I think you're perfect for each other. You'd make a great couple. She's got a great body, you've seen that for yourself. She lost weight and now she's has a really lovely figure.

STEVEN
Your mother is very beautiful, but the idea that she and I could ever be together is ludicrous.

(MORE)
 
33.

STEVEN (CONT’D)

Let me remind you that I'm a married man and I love my wife very much, and my kids, and that we are very happy together.

The boy looks at Steven, half sad and half angry. Tears well up in his eyes.

STEVEN (CONT’D)
And for your information, you're
absolutely fine. There's nothing
wrong with you. But you really
should stop smoking. Do you

promise?

Martin stands up.

MARTIN
So we're okay? There's nothing

wrong with me?

STEVEN
You couldn't be healthier. Now you'd better go because I'm late for my rounds. Let's talk tomorrow or the day after and arrange to meet again.

Steven heads towards the door.

MARTIN
I want you to buy me a motorbike. A white Honda CRF250. Will you?

STEVEN
We'll talk about it next time we

meet.


INT. MATTHEW'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

Steven and Matthew are standing over the steelhead trout. Matthew is gutting the fish. Steven watches him, drinking ginger beer from a bottle.


INT. BURGER KING - AFTERNOON

Martin is sitting by himself. He has finished his meal and is staring out the window. The doctor is clearly late. The boy checks his watch. He stares out the window again. His phone rings.
 
34.


MARTIN
Yes. Where are you? I called you a hundred times, didn't you see my calls? Yes I'm here, I've eaten already. Sorry I didn't wait for you but I was starving. What do you mean? What do you mean you can't? I got you an apple pie. At least come for a bit. You have to come. I've been waiting for over half an hour. Come for a bit. I can come closer to where you are. Where are you? Are you at the hospital? I'll bring you the apple pie.

A beat.

MARTIN (CONT’D)

What's so important? An operation? Are you at the hospital? What sort of incident? Not tomorrow, now. Not tomorrow. I can't tomorrow, I have to study. Now. Listen to me. Just a minute. Where are you?

Another beat.

Martin hangs up the phone. He looks annoyed.


EXT. MATTHEW'S HOUSE - GARDEN - DAY

Matthew is grilling pieces of trout on the barbecue. The garden is immaculate. At the back of the large, suburban house is a wooden deck. Anna is helping the anesthetist's wife, MARY, a woman of around 55, to set the table. Steven emerges from the house and sits in a chair. He looks ill at ease. He picks up a glass of wine and holds it in his hand, but doesn't drink.

ANNA
Where were you?

STEVEN
I was inside, making a phone call.

MATTHEW
The fish is almost ready. Pass me a plate.

STEVEN
Do you need a hand?
 
35.


MATTHEW
No, that's okay. I forgot to tell you. I saw that boy yesterday. Your son's friend.

STEVEN
Martin?

MATTHEW
Yes, right. Martin. I couldn't

remember his name.

STEVEN
Where did you see him?

MATTHEW
At the hospital. He was hanging around beside your car. It looked like he was waiting for you. I said hello, but he pretended not to see me.

STEVEN
That's impossible. It can't have

been him.

MATTHEW
Maybe I was mistaken. But it looked a lot like him.

STEVEN
You should go see Anna and get your eyes checked. Take my piece off the grill, will you? I don't like it overdone.


INT. STEVEN'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM


- NIGHT

Steven is sitting on the sofa, stroking the dog. He is eating a sandwich. He feeds the dog some ham. The door opens and Kim walks in.

KIM
Hi, Dad.

STEVEN
Hello, darling. Where have you

been?
 
36.


KIM
Choir practice.

STEVEN
Have you eaten?

KIM
Yes, I ate earlier.

STEVEN
You don't have to take the dog for a walk. I took him out already. We got back a little while ago.

KIM
Okay.

She puts her bag down by the door.

KIM (CONT’D)

Dad, do you know who I saw today?

STEVEN
Who, darling?

KIM
Martin.

STEVEN
Martin who?

KIM
Martin. That boy who came over the other day, the son of your ex-patient. He brought me back from choir practice on his friend's motorbike. He's really funny. I laughed so hard my ribs hurt.

STEVEN
Yes, he is very funny. Kim, I don't want you riding on motorbikes without a helmet.

KIM
I was wearing a helmet. He gave me his.

STEVEN
Why didn't you ask him to come in?

KIM
I did, but he was in a hurry. He

had to get home. Where's Mum?
 
37.


STEVEN
She's taking a shower. Is there

something you need?

KIM
I'm going up to bed.

She kisses Steven and leaves.

STEVEN
Good night.


EXT. STEVEN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Martin is standing on the pavement opposite Steven's house. He watches the house with a blank expression that betrays no emotion. He is holding a helmet under his arm. His friend's motorbike is parked beside him. It's a red HONDA CRF. The light in the living room goes off.


INT. STEVEN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING

Steven, Anna and Kim are having breakfast. Bob is not there.
Steven seems agitated.

KIM
"Good evening. Anna Murphy Eye

Clinic, how may I help you?"

ANNA
"Good evening. I'd like to make an appointment."

KIM
"When for?"

ANNA
"Certainly. Of course. When would

you like to come in?"

KIM
"Certainly, when would you like to come in?"

ANNA
"Today. It's urgent."

KIM
"Today is impossible."
 
38.


ANNA
"Please describe your symptoms." Then you come and talk to me and I tell you whether it's urgent or not. Meanwhile, you ask them to hold while you check to see whether any appointments are available.

STEVEN
Did you wake up Bob?

ANNA
I did. He just likes lying in bed for a bit before he gets up. Leave him be. Should I squeeze some more orange juice?

STEVEN
He'll be late. Have you seen the
time? The school bus will be here

any minute.

Steven gets up and goes to get Bob out of bed.


INT. STEVEN'S HOUSE - BOB'S BEDROOM - MORNING

Bob is sitting on the edge of his bed. As soon as his father enters the room, Bob turns to look at him. His face is pale. He looks a little frightened.

STEVEN
Robert, do you have any idea what time it is? Get up and get dressed.

BOB
I can't get up.

STEVEN
You have ten minutes to get washed, dressed and eat your breakfast. I'm not going to drive you to school and neither is your mother.

BOB
I can't get up.

STEVEN
Bob. Get up and get dressed and

stop messing about.

Steven goes to leave the room.
 
39.


BOB
Dad. My legs. They're numb. I can't move them. I can't stand up.

Bob is on the verge of tears.


INT. STEVEN'S HOUSE - GARAGE - MORNING

The garage door opens automatically. Steven lifts his son into the car. Anna helps him. She closes the back door of the car and then gets into the driver's seat.


EXT. HOSPITAL ENTRANCE - MORNING

Steven lifts Bob out of the car. He puts a hand around his shoulder and practically carries his son into the hospital. Anna follows them inside.


INT. HOSPITAL - NEUROLOGIST'S OFFICE - MORNING

DR. ANDREW NICHOLS, a neurologist, is examining Bob. The boy is lying on a hospital bed. His shoes are off. Steven is sitting in a chair, watching the whole procedure. He tries to crack a joke to reassure his son.

STEVEN
I hope you washed your feet yesterday, Bob, because Dr. Nichols punishes boys who don't wash between their toes. He gives them injections with big fat needles.

DR. NICHOLS
Bob's feet are just fine and he has lovely hair and he is very brave. He's all grown up now. You know I had long hair when I was little, too. Just like Bob.

STEVEN
I didn't know that. Really?

DR. NICHOLS
Yes, really. Only mine was curlier. Now then Bob, I want you to tell me where you are.

BOB
I'm at the hospital. In the

neurology department.
 
40.


DR. NICHOLS
That's absolutely right. And what

day is it today?

BOB
Thursday.

DR. NICHOLS
Okay then. With this pin, I'm going to touch the soles of your feet and all your toes. I want you to tell me if you can feel it. Don't be scared, I'm not going to prick you, I'm just going to touch you. Okay?

Bob nods.

DR. NICHOLS (CONT’D)

Perfect.

Bob can feel the pin under all his toes.

DR. NICHOLS (CONT’D) Perfect. Now, look directly into my eyes for this one. As soon as you see a finger move, point to it.

The neurologist spreads out his hands and fingers. Bob looks him in the eye without moving his head. Dr. Nichols moves a finger on the left, then a finger on the right, then both fingers together. Bob points to the correct fingers every time.

DR. NICHOLS (CONT’D) Okay, good. Now I'm going to test your sensations. I want you to tell me if this feels the same on both sides.

He touches Bob on the left and right cheek, the left and right ear, the left and right temple. Bob nods each time.

DR. NICHOLS (CONT’D)

Now close your eyes as tight as you can. Okay. Show me your teeth. Okay.


INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - MORNING

Anna is waiting in the corridor. Steven and Bob go up to her.
Bob is limping a little, but he can walk.
 
41.


ANNA
What happened?

STEVEN
Everything is absolutely fine.
Andrew gave him a thorough
neurological examination and he
passed with flying colours. It's
nothing. You two go home and we'll
talk tonight. I won't be late, my
schedule is pretty light today.
Okay?

ANNA
Maybe he should have an MRI.

STEVEN
There's no need to bother with all that. He just got scared, that's all. He's absolutely fine. You're absolutely fine, aren't you?

BOB
Yes.

STEVEN
I think there was probably some
test at school today that we

weren't very well prepared for.

ANNA
Yes, and he preferred to spend his day at the hospital with Andrew and us. Let's go.

BOB
Dad, aren't you going to show me

your office?

STEVEN
Another time, darling. I have to go down to the operating theatre right away.

Steven kisses his son and walks away.

STEVEN (CONT’D)
I've have to go. See you tonight.
Call me if you need anything. Bye

bye.

ANNA
Bye, darling.
 
42.


Anna leads Bob away.


INT. HOSPITAL ENTRANCE - MORNING

Anna and Bob are walking towards the exit. The moment they step outside, Bob collapses to the ground. His mother bends down and tries to lift him up. She calls for help and two NURSES rush over. They lift Bob into a wheelchair.


INT. HOSPITAL - MRI SCANNER ROOM - MORNING

Bob is lying inside an MRI machine. Steven and Anna watch from behind a glass window. Dr. Nichols is taking notes.

INT. HOSPITAL - PATIENT'S ROOM - NIGHT

Bob is sleeping. Anna sits beside him. Steven stands talking to Matthew. There is a second bed in the room, but it is empty.

MATTHEW
You don't have to operate tomorrow.

Cancel everything.

STEVEN
No. Why would I cancel? The schedule would go haywire. There's no need. Anyway, it's nothing.

The door opens and Dr. Nichols walks in.

ANNA
Any news, Andrew?

DR. NICHOLS
MRI and MRA both fine. Blood work came back good. Cardiogram, chest X-ray and carotid ultrasound all clear.

STEVEN
I told you. I knew it.

ANNA
Thank goodness for that.

DR. NICHOLS
Has he been under any psychological stress lately? Exams at school maybe?
 
43.


STEVEN
Yes.

ANNA
No, he wasn't stressed, he was just fine. He's always a bit anxious, but that's just the way he is.

DR. NICHOLS
In my opinion, he should stay in
tomorrow as well so that we can

keep an eye on him.

ANNA
Maybe we should give him a PET

scan?

STEVEN
I don't think there's any need for that, do you Andrew? Tomorrow he'll be well enough to walk all the way home.

DR. NICHOLS
Yes, I don't think that's necessary at this point. Let's see how things are tomorrow and take it from there. There's nothing to worry about, in my opinion. You go home and we'll speak tomorrow. I'll be here all day. Anna, it was great seeing you, even under these circumstances.

ANNA
And you, Andrew. How's your

daughter?

DR. NICHOLS
She got married last year. I'm a

grandfather now.

ANNA
Give her my love.

DR. NICHOLS
I will. Good night.

STEVEN
Goodbye, Andrew. Thanks for

everything.
 
44.


MATTHEW
Do you want me to let them know
that you won't be operating

tomorrow?

STEVEN
I said no. Don't go on about it.

ANNA
That won't be necessary, Matthew. I'll come in the morning. I won't go in to the clinic. I'll bring him those cinnamon doughnuts he loves so much.

STEVEN
Yes, I'm sure he'll be thrilled.


EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

Martin is riding his friend's motorbike. Kim sits behind him, holding on tight. Neither of them are wearing helmets. Martin focuses all his attention on the road. Tears are streaming down Kim's face, but it's impossible to tell whether it's from the wind or if she's crying for some other reason.


EXT. STEVEN'S HOUSE - GARDEN - NIGHT

Anna is watering the plants. Kim comes out into the garden.

ANNA
Where were you?

KIM
At Claire's. Is Dad asleep?

ANNA
Yes.

KIM
How's Bob?

ANNA
Bob is absolutely fine. They've

just kept him in as a precaution.

Kim looks at her mother for a while without saying anything.

KIM
How are you?
 
45.


ANNA
I'm fine. How do you mean?

KIM
I mean are you tired?

ANNA
I'm absolutely fine. A little

tired, that's all.

KIM
Okay.

ANNA
See you in the morning. Oh, and while Bob's in the hospital, you'll be responsible for watering the plants. Okay?

Kim walks away without answering.


INT. HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR - MORNING

Steven, dressed in his white doctor's coat, and Anna, holding a box of doughnuts, are walking down the corridor. It is rush hour at the hospital. They both greet various people as they walk along.

ANNA
Did he go to the toilet? Did he get up?

STEVEN
He hadn't when I passed by about an hour ago. He didn't want to.

ANNA
He didn't want to pee or he hadn't got up?

STEVEN
He didn't want to pee.

ANNA
Could he get up?

STEVEN
He was asleep. I didn't want to

drag him out of bed.

They stop outside the door to Bob's room.
 
46.


INT. HOSPITAL - PATIENT'S ROOM - MORNING

Steven and Anna enter Bob's room. Martin is already there, sitting next to Bob's bed. Martin stands up.

MARTIN
Good morning, Doctor. How are you
Mrs. Murphy? I just came by to see

Bob. Kim told me what happened.

ANNA
Hello, Martin. How nice of you. Hi darling, good morning. Did your friend Martin come to see you?

Bob does not reply.

MARTIN
I'll leave you alone now so that you can spend time with him too. I have to go anyway. I'll come by and see him again some other time, for sure. I offered to help him go to the toilet but he didn't want me to and he wet the bed. I brought some lemonade. Mum made it yesterday.

MARTIN (CONT’D)
Try it and let me know what you
think.

STEVEN
Thank you very much.

Anna goes over to Bob.

ANNA
Darling, do you know what's in this box?

BOB
What?

ANNA
Cinnamon doughnuts, that's what.

Martin goes over to Steven. Anna pulls off the sheets and folds them up.

MARTIN
I'll be in the canteen. Come

whenever you can.
 
47.


STEVEN
I don't think I'll have time today, as you might imagine. We'll talk some other time.

MARTIN
No. Today. Come to the canteen. Just for ten minutes. Don't stand me up like last time. Goodbye Mrs. Murphy. Bye, Bob.

Martin leaves. We hear Anna saying goodbye as we watch him go.


INT. HOSPITAL CANTEEN - AFTERNOON

Martin is waiting in the hospital canteen. Steven appears. The canteen is packed with doctors, nurses and patients, seated at the tables.

MARTIN
Coffee? Apple pie?

STEVEN
I've only got ten minutes. I have to be back upstairs in ten minutes max.

MARTIN
Okay. I'll get straight to the point. I've brought you a present.

MARTIN (CONT’D)
You've given me so many presents
and I've never given you anything.
I thought that was rude of me. So I
decided to make amends. Close your

eyes.

Steven does not close his eyes.

MARTIN (CONT’D)

Please close your eyes.

Steven, losing patience, closes his eyes. Martin places a small box in his hand. Steven opens his eyes and sees the box.

MARTIN (CONT’D)

It's a Swiss army knife.

The boy puts his hand over his mouth, mortified.
 
48.


MARTIN (CONT’D)
I shouldn't have told you that. I
messed it up. I ruined the

surprise. I'm sorry.

STEVEN
Thank you very much, Martin.

MARTIN
What an idiot.

STEVEN
It doesn't matter. Thank you very

much.

A PARAMEDIC approaches the doctor.

PARAMEDIC
Good afternoon, Doctor.

STEVEN
Hello, Justin.

PARAMEDIC
I got the car. Second-hand, but still. Blue. I couldn't find it in silver.

STEVEN
That's great. You'll have to take

me for a ride in it soon.

PARAMEDIC
Yeah, sure. See you later.

The paramedic walks away.

MARTIN
That reminds me, did you do
anything about that motorbike I

wanted?

STEVEN
Martin, I have to get back

upstairs.

MARTIN
All right. I won't keep you much
longer, even though you are
devoting less and less time to me
lately. But that's okay, I
understand. I just wanted to say
one more thing. I'm really sorry
about Bob.
 
49.


STEVEN
It's nothing serious.

MARTIN
No, it is. That critical moment we both knew would come someday, well, here it is. The time is now. You'll see, things will be better for us all after this. You know what I mean.

STEVEN
No, I don't. Listen, Martin, I don't have time for this. I have to be upstairs.

Steven stares at Martin in silence. The boy looks around to make sure nobody can hear them, that nobody is sitting too close.

MARTIN
(speaking fast, almost
without catching his
breath)

Okay, I'm going to tell you this as quickly as I can so that I don't hold you up since I get that you don't have much time and you have to go back up to the ward. I will make myself as clear as possible. Yes, it's exactly what you think. Yes. That's it. Just like you killed a member of my family, now you have to kill a member of your own family. To balance things out, understand? I'm not going to tell you who to kill of course, that's for you to decide. But if you don't do it, they all die. Bob will die. Kim will die.

MARTIN (CONT’D)
And so will your wife. They will
all get sick and die. One:
paralysis of the limbs, two:
refusal of food to the point of
starvation, three: bleeding from
the eyes, four: death. One, two,
three, four. You're not going to
get sick, don't worry. You just
have to stay calm, that's all.
There, I said it. As quickly as I
could. I hope I haven't kept you
too long.

(MORE)
 
50.

MARTIN (CONT’D)

Oh and one more thing, but I'll be very quick. You only have a few days to decide who to kill. Once stage three kicks in - remember what stage three is? Bleeding from the eyes, that's stage three - once the bleeding starts, they die in a matter of hours. Well, don't let me keep you. I have nothing more to say. Unless you have any questions.

Steven stares at Martin in silence. He is clearly furious. He picks up his mobile phone and keys.

STEVEN
Get up and get out of here and don't you dare come back or call me ever again. Now. Before I hit you.

MARTIN
All right, I'll go. I have to go anyway, I have French class to get to. I was leaving anyway. But don't get angry. There's really no point getting mad at me. I told you. This will do us all good. You'll see.

STEVEN
If you ever come anywhere near me, my wife, or my children again I will kill you, I swear.

MARTIN
(loudly)

But how will you kill me? Oh wait, I have an idea. Why don't you operate on me?

Several people turn and stare at the doctor. Steven gets up and leaves. Martin calls after him.

MARTIN (CONT’D)

Do you know if Kim's going to come by today?

MARTIN (CONT’D)

If she does, tell her I'll be outside, at the main entrance. I'm going for a cigarette.
 
51.


INT. HOSPITAL ENTRANCE - AFTERNOON

Two security guards escort Martin out of the building. He heads towards the exit without putting up a fight. He glances over his shoulder and then walks out, zipping up his jacket and smoothing down his hair.


INT. HOSPITAL - PATIENT'S ROOM - EVENING

Anna is sitting on the empty bed next to her son's bed. She is reading him a book. Steven comes in and sits in a chair. He is restless.

STEVEN
Has he eaten?

ANNA
No, he's not hungry.

STEVEN
What do you mean he's not hungry?

ANNA
He's not hungry.

Steven takes a doughnut out of the box. He reaches over and puts it near his son's mouth.

STEVEN
Come on, darling. Eat a doughnut.

BOB
I don't want it, dad.

STEVEN
You do, but you're afraid that your mother and I will tell you off for eating doughnuts. Come on, eat it. You have my permission. You have our permission. It's okay for him to eat a doughnut, isn't it Anna?

ANNA
Yes.

STEVEN
You heard your mother. Eat it.

He prises Bobs lips open and shoves the whole doughnut into his mouth. Anna gets up and pulls Steven away from their son.
 
52.


ANNA
Leave him alone. He doesn't want it now. He'll eat it later.

Steven does not back down. He gestures for Anna to sit back down.

STEVEN
That's right. Chew it a bit. Now

swallow.

Bob spits the doughnut out.

ANNA
Leave him alone. He said he doesn't want it now.

STEVEN
He is going to eat it right now. He is completely run down, that's why he keeps falling over and crawling around on all fours. He's going to eat them, all of them. In five minutes flat, I want to see this whole box empty.

Steven storms out of the room, slamming the door behind him as he goes.


INT. HOSPITAL - DIRECTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Steven, Anna, Dr. Nichols and the HOSPITAL DIRECTOR are discussing Bob's case. A FEMALE DOCTOR is standing beside them, along with Matthew. They have spread all of Bob's test results out on the desk. The Hospital Director studies the test results thoroughly, in silence.

ANNA
He stopped eating today. He keeps

vomiting.

The Hospital Director looks up at Anna and then looks back at the test results.

STEVEN
Some of the tests need to be done again, in my opinion. They haven't found anything, it's not possible.

ANNA
It's been less than a day since his last tests. I don't think the results will be any different.

(MORE)
 
53.

ANNA (CONT’D)

To be honest, I think what we have here is a clear case of some psychosomatic disorder.

HOSPITAL DIRECTOR
I'm inclined to agree with Anna.

STEVEN
What do you mean? Shouldn't we rule out all possible causes before we resort to the easy option of a psychosomatic disorder?

DR. NICHOLS
We already have ruled out

everything else.

HOSPITAL DIRECTOR
I think with psychiatric treatment and psychological support everything will be fine. He will walk again and eat just fine.

ANNA
Of course he will.

STEVEN
Anna, if Bob was short-sighted or had a cataract or glaucoma, then your opinion really would be valuable. But thankfully Bob's eyesight is perfect. And I can honestly say that if he ever needed glasses, you'd be the first person I'd consult. But right now the boy can't eat and is paralysed in both legs, so I'm afraid I'm not remotely interested in your medical opinion.

Nobody says a word. Anna opens the door and leaves the room.


INT. STEVEN'S HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT

Kim puts on lipstick and brushes her hair in front of the mirror. She then sprays herself with a little too much perfume.
 
54.


INT. STEVEN'S HOUSE - KIM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Kim and Martin are sitting on the bed, kissing. The bedroom lights are on. Music is playing on the computer. Kim's bed is made. Martin touches her breast.

MARTIN
Are you on your period?

KIM
No. If you're hungry we can order

something later.

KIM (CONT’D)
My parents will be home late and
they've left me some money.

MARTIN
I'm not hungry.

Kim stands up, strips down to her underwear and lies on the bed, beneath her swimsuit picture. Martin smiles.

MARTIN (CONT’D)

You are the prettiest girl I've ever met. Your mother is making a big mistake not trusting you to work at the clinic. A huge mistake.

They kiss.

MARTIN (CONT’D)

I'm afraid I have to go.

KIM
Why? Stay a bit longer. We can

listen to some music.

MARTIN
I can't, Kim. It's late.

KIM
Are you mad at me because of my

dad?

MARTIN
Don't be stupid. I'm not mad at you at all. And I thought I'd made myself clear - I don't feel angry at him, I feel sorry for him. I have to go because it's late, that's all. It's as simple as that. Don't be annoying, I thought you understood.
 
55.


KIM
I'm sorry. Martin, I love you so

much.

He hugs her but does not say it back.


INT. HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Anna is marching angrily down the corridor. Steven follows her, holding a file of papers.

STEVEN
I'm sorry about what happened in

there.

ANNA
It doesn't matter.

STEVEN
I'm just so exhausted and stressed and...

ANNA
(interrupting)

It's okay.

STEVEN
You go home. I'm staying here.

ANNA
What do you mean?

STEVEN
I'm going to give him all the tests again. Every single one of them. I'm staying here. Go home.

ANNA
Let's go home and we'll talk it

over again tomorrow.

STEVEN
Just go. Go to Kim, she's by

herself. I'll come later. Go.

ANNA
Good night.

Anna stands there watching Steven as he goes back towards the patients' ward.
 
56.


INT. HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Steven pushes Bob along in a wheelchair. Bob looks groggy. He's half asleep. Steven marches manically up and down the hospital corridors.


INT. HOSPITAL - BLOOD TEST ROOM - NIGHT

Steven takes blood from Bob. He gives the blood sample to a nurse.


INT. HOSPITAL - MRI SCANNER ROOM - NIGHT

Bob is lying inside the MRI machine. He disappears into the machine as Steven watches.


INT. HOSPITAL - ULTRASOUND ROOM - NIGHT

Tired but wired, Steven stands next to a doctor who is giving Bob an abdominal ultrasound.

DOCTOR
Take a deep breath and hold it for a few seconds. Good.


INT. HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Steven pushes Bob back to his room in the wheelchair. Bob is shattered, so is Steven. Abruptly, Steven stops pushing the wheelchair, lifts Bob up with both hands, puts his arms around him and walks him down the corridor, with the drip trailing behind them. Steven lets go of Bob and he falls to the floor. Steven picks him up again. He kneels down in front of his son.

STEVEN
Bob, why don't we play a game?

BOB
What game?

STEVEN
I'll tell you a secret, something I've never told you before, and then you'll tell me one. And whoever tells the best secret wins. Okay? When I was your age I'd just started masturbating and I'd only just started ejaculating. Only a little, barely a drop.

(MORE)
 
57.

STEVEN (CONT’D)

I was worried that I had some kind of problem because at school I'd heard all sorts of stories. Then one day when my father had had a lot to drink and my brothers were out and he was sleeping in the bedroom, I crept inside, put my hand on his penis and started stroking it until he ejaculated. The sheets got covered in sperm. I got scared and ran out. I've never told anybody that before. Now it's your turn to tell me a secret.

Bob stares at his father, dumbstruck. An awkward silence.

BOB
I don't know. I don't have one.

STEVEN
That's impossible, you must have

one.

BOB
I don't.

STEVEN
Bob, if all this is just an act, you should know that if you tell me now, I won't punish you and neither will your mother. We won't be angry with you either.

BOB
It's not an act.

STEVEN
But if it is an act and you don't stop this stupid joke right this minute, your punishment won't just be no TV for a month. I will take my electric shaver and I will shave your head and I will make you eat your hair. I mean it, I will literally make you eat your hair. I'm not kidding.

BOB
It's not an act.

Steven puts Bob back into the wheelchair in silence.
 
58.


INT. STEVEN'S OFFICE - HOSPITAL - MORNING

Steven is asleep at his desk. His hair is tousled and his tie is undone. The door opens and Anna walks in. Steven wakes up. Anna hands him a takeaway coffee. They don't say anything. Steven has nothing to report.

ANNA
I brought you a clean shirt.

She takes a shirt out of her bag and hangs it up inside the locker where Steven keeps his lab coat.

STEVEN
Thank you.

ANNA
Anything to tell me?

Steven shakes his head.

ANNA (CONT’D)
Hungry? Want me to bring you
something to eat?

STEVEN
No, thank you. Maybe you were
right. Maybe it's all

psychological.

ANNA
Everything will be all right, you'll see. Trust me. We're in this together and everything will be all right. Let's go and get you something to eat and some fresh air and then we'll go up and see the little one.


INT. SCHOOL - REHEARSAL ROOM - DAY

Kim is singing in the choir. A middle-aged man, the CHOIRMASTER, is conducting the orchestra. Suddenly, Kim falls down. At first, everybody around her carries on singing. As fear ripples through the choir, everyone gradually falls silent and the music stops. The choirmaster rushes over to see what has happened.


INT. HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR - AFTERNOON

Anna is sitting outside Bob's room, crying. Matthew hugs her.
A nurse comes out of the room, pushing a food trolley.
 
59.


INT. HOSPITAL - PATIENT'S ROOM - AFTERNOON

Kim and Bob are lying in adjacent beds. Steven is feeding Kim pieces of fruit. Kim spits them out. Bob watches them, slowly opening and closing his eyes. He looks as if he has just woken up. Their dinner plates lie untouched on trays.

KIM
Dad, I don't want any fruit.

STEVEN
Just one bite. For me.

Kim chokes and her face flushes. She spits out the piece of apple that Steven has fed her.


INT. HOSPITAL - PATIENT'S ROOM - EVENING

A nurse inserts nasogastric feeding tubes into the noses of both children. Kim has calmed down, but looks exhausted.

KIM
I want to sleep.

STEVEN
All right, darling. What are you
going to wear to Claire's party,

did you decide yet?

KIM
No. I'm tired, Dad. Switch off the light.

Steven goes to turn the light off. He spots a new MP3 player on the bedside table.

STEVEN
Where did you get this? Did Mum

give it to you?

KIM
No. Martin did. He made me a
playlist with some songs that he

likes. That we both like.

STEVEN
When did he give you this?

KIM
I don't remember. Good night, Dad.

STEVEN
Good night.
 
60.


EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

Steven sits in his car, thinking. He opens the car door, gets out, and walks quickly and angrily across the road. He is outside Martin's house. He sees a light on in the living room. The TV is blaring. Steven goes up to the front door and rings the doorbell frantically. Nobody answers. He bangs on the door with his fists.

STEVEN
Open the door. I know you're in there. Open the door or I will smash it down. Martin. Open the door or I will smash it down and I will fuck you and your mother just the way you wanted.

Steven tries to break in through the balcony doors, but doesn't succeed.

STEVEN (CONT’D)
If anything happens to my kids or
my wife, you'll die in prison, do

you hear me? You'll die in prison.


EXT. HOSPITAL GROUNDS - NIGHT

Anna is sitting on the steps outside the hospital. Steven stands beside her. He appears rather sheepish and speaks in a low voice. He avoids looking Anna in the eye.

ANNA
How old was his father when he

died?

STEVEN
ANNA

Had you been drinking that day?

STEVEN (CONT’D)

He had an arrhythmia, a stroke, and that was it.

ANNA
I asked whether you'd been drinking, not how he died. How long has this been going on? How long have you been seeing this boy?

STEVEN
About six months.
 
61.


ANNA
Where were you meeting?

STEVEN
What does it matter?

ANNA
Where were you meeting him?

STEVEN
At a Burger King, then we'd drive to the seaside. He's got issues, serious psychological issues. He always did. I knew he acted weird sometimes, but now he's lost it completely, he's become dangerous. We have to take precautions. Go to the police and take some precautions.

ANNA
You're not going to the police. You're not going to tell anyone. There's no point. We'll wait and see. Had you been drinking when you operated on his father?

STEVEN
Only a little. That had nothing to do with the outcome. A surgeon never kills a patient. An anesthetist can kill a patient, but a surgeon never can. For example, Matthew has made mistakes that led to the death of a patient, but I never have.

Anna turns her head away. She doesn't say anything.

STEVEN (CONT’D)
I think Bob is a little better
today. He seemed in a better mood

and he wasn't so pale.

Anna does not respond.

ANNA
Why didn't you tell me you were

seeing him?

STEVEN
At first I didn't see him that often, it was only recently that we started meeting more regularly.

(MORE)
 
62.

STEVEN (CONT’D)

I was going to tell you at some point. I felt sorry for him. I gave him some money. His mum is out of work.

ANNA
I'm going upstairs.

Anna gets up and leaves. Steven stands there for a while, alone with his thoughts. Then he follows his wife into the hospital.
