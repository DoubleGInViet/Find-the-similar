BLACK.

The rumble of a lonely FOGHORN. Low. Faint.

TITLE:	THE	LIGHTHOUSE


EXT. ATLANTIC OCEAN - DAY

EXTREMELY WIDE SHOT: Fog. Nothing else in sight. Slowly, a SMALL STEAM BOAT emerges: A LIGHTHOUSE TENDER. It chugs along, a tiny blip in a vast ocean. Black smoke billows from its crooked chimney. Its old engine sputters softly.

Hold.

The FOGHORN again, louder now. Closer.


EXT. LIGHTHOUSE TENDER. HULL - LATER

CLOSE ON: The rotten, rusty hull carves through the waves.
The third-rate engine rumbles.

Hold.


EXT. LIGHTHOUSE TENDER. DECK - SUNSET

WIDE: SHADOWS stand on the bow of the old boat (back to CAMERA). They might be men, but they could just as easily be ghosts.

THE FOGHORN BLASTS. It’s close enough to feel.

A FLASH OF LIGHT breaks through the fog, revealing...

The silhouette of a bleak stone island, no bigger than an acre: PILOT ROCK. A few ramshackle outbuildings cling to the surface like barnacles. On the highest point of the island stands a crumbling LIGHTHOUSE. An ominous flock of SEAGULLS screech and caw around it.

THE FOGHORN and LIGHT bellow and flash again.

THE ISLAND itself seems to draw the boat and the men closer.


EXT. PILOT ROCK. SHORE - SUNSET

It’s dark in the fog, even with the flashing light above.

THE TWO MEN FROM THE TENDER come in and out of view, carrying supplies from the shore.
 
2.


One lags behind, carrying the heavier load.

They walk past a small, dilapidated BOATHOUSE with no door. A poorly mended DORY -- THE LIFE BOAT -- is tied up inside, sitting on twisted runners that stretch out into the lapping waves.


EXT. PILOT ROCK. NEAR THE LIVING QUARTERS - SUNSET

TWO OTHER MEN (late 60s) exit the one-story CLAPBOARD SHACK that adjoins THE LIGHTHOUSE. They are the departing LIGHTHOUSE KEEPERS -- “WICKIES,” as they refer to themselves. They lug gunny sacks over their shoulders, and drag their rope-handled ditty boxes by their sides, keeping their heads down. Their bearded faces are craggy and leaden. They reek of tobacco, must, and salt. They shuffle toward their relief: THE MEN FROM THE TENDER, carrying their supplies.

The four almost exchange glances. But they don’t bother.

THE FOGHORN bellows.


EXT. PILOT ROCK. NEAR THE LIVING QUARTERS – LATER

The new wickies stand utterly still, next to each other, their gazes fixed on the same distant spot.

One man is OLD (Haggard 60? Spry 80?). He’s weathered, bearded, and hunched, with hands like vises. His eyes shine like jewels. An old Pan. A Satyr.

The other is YOUNG (30s/40s), athletic, with dark eyes and a barrel chest. His expression is severe. A small moustache shows his vanity.

They watch THE TENDER depart the island, ever-so-slowly disappearing -- swallowed up again by the fog.

THE FOGHORN bellows louder than ever, penetrating deep through the bodies of the two men. It shakes the YOUNG man a little, but not the OLD one.

OLD puts the stump of an unlit clay PIPE in his mouth (upside down). He lumbers out of frame, limping a bit.

YOUNG stays standing, staring out.


INT. LIVING QUARTERS. GALLEY – EVENING

YOUNG throws down his heavy supplies.
 
3.


They thud against the warped, mildewed floorboards.

He walks through the kitchen and takes a look around...

It’s run-down and spare: A coal range, a farmhouse sink with a water pump by the sole window, a small cabinet, a table and two chairs.

The wind blows. It’s depressing.

He keeps walking.

He hears the sound of dribbling water...

The sound grows louder as he enters the sleeping quarters...


INT. LIVING QUARTERS. BUNKROOM – CONTINUOUS

It’s also dismal. Not much more than two sagging cast-iron single beds. A CLOCK ticks monotonously.

OLD stands near his bed, PISSING INTO HIS CHAMBER POT.

Pause. YOUNG absorbs the scene.

YOUNG walks to the unoccupied bed and sits down. As soon as he does, OLD FARTS about three feet away from YOUNG’S face.

Pause.

OLD finishes relieving himself. He shakes his member. He buttons up, and kicks the pot under his bed. The piss nearly sloshes out. Mercifully, it doesn’t.

OLD limps away whistling (the song “Tis Brasswork”).

He pauses briefly...

Farts again.

He leaves frame, his UNEVEN GATE disappearing: Walk-drag, walk-drag, walk-drag...

YOUNG sits on his bed. Still. He’s not pleased. But he’ll keep that to himself.

Just then, YOUNG feels something strange under him...

He feels around...

He discovers a hole in the mattress. Something is poking out...
 
4.


He digs his finger into the hole...

He removes some horsehair stuffing...

He pulls out a small trinket, about six inches long... It’s a MERMAID carved from ivory, with scrimshawed scales on her tail. A primitive but pretty effigy. Strange.

YOUNG looks at it with curiosity...

He rubs his thumb over her body... her breasts...

He feels a bit guilty.

HOLD.


INT. FOG SIGNAL HOUSE – NIGHT

CLOSE ON: The hulking steam-powered foghorn engine. A piston pumps, gears grind, a huge flywheel spins and spins.

CAMERA BOOMS DOWN TO: THE MOUTH ON THE HUNGRY FURNACE GLOWING WITH FIRE.

A SHOVEL FULL OF COAL enters frame and feeds the flames.

Another shovel full.

And another.

THE FOG SIGNAL BLOWS EXCRUCIATINGLY LOUDLY.

CLOSE, REVERSE: YOUNG shovels coal into the furnace, dripping with sweat, wincing from the intense heat.

He shovels again and again.

THE FOG SIGNAL BLOWS: LOUD. CLOSE. PAINFUL.


INT. LIVING QUARTERS. GALLEY. BEHIND THE RANGE - NIGHT

OLD’s knobby HAND grasps blindly for a crate. When his fingers meet it, it clinks from something glass inside.

INT. LIVING QUARTERS. GALLEY - NIGHT

OLD blows the dust off the crate. He smiles with relief, pulling out a sea glass LIQUOR BOTTLE.
 
5.


-	LATER It’s dark.
The two men sit in the cramped galley. A kerosene lamp flickers on the table between them, it is bent to one side, but still works fine. Lukewarm scrod and potatoes wait on battered mess plates. YOUNG rolls a cigarette on the table. His coal-blackened hands stain the paper.

OLD sets down two cups. Tin. Chipped china.

OLD
Should pale death with treble dread make the ocean caves our bed, God who hear'st the surges roll,
deign to save the suppliant soul.

He pours a strange, thick liquid into the cups. Homemade hooch?

He holds his up for a toast.

OLD (CONT’D)
To four weeks.

YOUNG pauses. He hesitates as if he thinks he is being tested.

He decides to stay focused on the cigarette.

YOUNG
Thank you, no, sir.

OLD
Bad luck to leave a toast

unfinished, lad.

YOUNG tucks his cigarette behind his ear.

YOUNG
No disrespect meant, sir.

OLD
A man what don’t drink, best have

his reasons.

YOUNG
Ain’t it--

YOUNG stops himself to rephrase, more respectfully.

I understood it’s against
regulations, sir.
 
6.


OLD
Did you?

YOUNG
Yes, sir.

OLD won’t budge. His cup is still raised.

YOUNG (CONT’D)
From the manual.

OLD
Didn’t picture you was a reading

man.

YOUNG
Not trying for trouble–-

OLD
Then you do as I say. That’s in yer book, too.

Long pause.

YOUNG smiles. His expression seems to say: “This old guy is a piece of work”

YOUNG takes his cup very deliberately.

He stands up.

Pause.

He walks to the farmhouse sink and pours out the booze.

He pumps some water into his cup.

He sits back down.

He holds up his cup to toast.

YOUNG
To four weeks.

OLD smiles -– a little too wide. They click cups.

They drink...

But just as soon as they do: YOUNG RETCHES! A terrible taste.

OLD revels in the mishap.
 
7.


OLD
Aye. The cistern needs a-lookin’ to. One of yer duties, lad. Or didn’t ye read yerself about it? Polishing, swabbing. Swabbing, polishing. You’ll clean the brass and the clockwork. You can tidy the quarters after, and there’s well-more to be mended outside.

YOUNG nods yes, his dry heaving subsiding.

OLD (CONT’D)
D’you hear me, lad?

YOUNG
Yessir-–

OLD
(correcting him)

“Aye, sir!”

YOUNG
Aye, sir.

OLD starts eating his supper. His habits are a bit uncouth.

OLD
When the fog clears, you’ll take

the dog watch--

YOUNG
Dogging it already?

OLD
It’s the mid watch that’s to dread lad, night to morning. My watch. I tend the light! Some junior man I’m fixed with -- Ye act like ye never been to sea a’fore.

YOUNG
I...

YOUNG hesitates, he hasn’t been at sea before -- clearly. But not worth the trouble getting into it now.

Aye, sir.

OLD
Now, see to your duties. The

light’s mine.
 
8.


INT. LIVING QUARTERS. BUNKROOM. THE MIRROR – NIGHT

MEDIUM SHOT: OLD, no longer in his civilian clothes, is dressing himself with the same ceremony as a cleric might. Each item of clothing has a purpose. To wear it wrong would be blasphemy.

The collar of his jacket is marked “K” for head keeper. Buttons are labeled “USLHE:” U.S. Lighthouse Establishment. His uniform is far from new, but it’s well cared for. Darned, patched, and tidy. As few wrinkles as possible. Boots are shined. Tie is straight.

The CLOCK ticks monotonously.


EXT. PILOT ROCK - NIGHT

EXTREME WIDE SHOT: THE LIGHTHOUSE flashes. THE FOGHORN blasts.


INT. FOG SIGNAL HOUSE - NIGHT

YOUNG shovels more coal into the furnace.

He looks to the BOOK that rests on a chair by the hot, whirring machinery: “Instructions to Light-Keepers, July, 1881.”


INT. LIGHTHOUSE. TOWER STAIRS – NIGHT

THE CAMERA BOOMS UP THROUGH: The clinking and clanking gears of the light’s clockwork...

A heavy lead weight on a chain slowly rises up through the center of the tower’s cast-iron spiral stairs...

Wondrous patterns of swirling light move through the ironwork.

The patterns shift rhythmically -– hypnotically.


INT. LIGHTHOUSE. LANTERN ROOM - NIGHT

OLD sits in a sweat, mesmerized by the LIGHT. The machinery whirs. THE HEAT from the enormous SECOND-ORDER FRESNEL LENS is immense. He is haloed in his pipe smoke.

His jacket is off...

Not cool enough.
 
9.


He opens his union suit...


-LATER

Now he’s bare chested. His big, hard gut and strong arms shine with sweat. There’s a faded three-masted ship tattooed on his chest, and several crooked stick-and-pokes elsewhere -- all glistening.

And... he has a BRASS KEY around his neck on a chain.

He pours grog into his tin cup. He toasts the light. Drinks.

His eyes are heavy.

He’s not drunk yet. But he wants to be.

He pours another drink.

Toasts.


EXT. FOG SIGNAL HOUSE - NIGHT

YOUNG stares up at the magical light. It truly is a wonder.

He’s outside the signal shed. It’s an odd looking building with its huge protruding trumpet, held up by rickety struts.

YOUNG tries to light his cigarette. The wind and dampness of the foggy air makes it impossible.

His match won’t light.

THE FOGHORN BLASTS.

YOUNG strikes the match again. The match is lit... the wind blows it out. Damn!

He strikes the match again...

THE FOGHORN BLASTS.


EXT. PILOT ROCK. SHORE - NIGHT

YOUNG is finally smoking his cigarette. He slowly walks toward the shore...

HE IS DRAWN TO THE LIGHT from the lighthouse reflecting on the water.

He pauses, the waves lapping against the rocks.
 
10.


He starts walking into the tide...

He walks further, he doesn't stop... hypnotized by the water...

THE LIGHT...

Further...

Further...

Seaweed, moss, and slime surround his knees.

Further...

Then, slowly, A HUGE LOG, forty feet long and still sheathed in bark, floats toward him...

Another log...

Another!

He looks ahead and THE SEA IS FULL OF LOGS: A RIVER LOG DRIVE. He wants to run, but he can’t... he keeps wading deeper into the ocean of logs...

He is almost up to his neck in water... Suddenly, he sees:
THE BODY OF A MAN floating face down in the logs:

HE WEARS A WOOL MACKINAW COAT AND LEATHER BOOTS WITH THICK HOBNAILED SOLES.

Nearby is some kind of tool floating: A WOODEN POLE WITH A MENACING IRON HOOK at the end of it (a “CANT HOOK” for moving logs in a log drive).

THE LOGS BEGIN TO JAM...

THE BODY FLOATS TOWARD YOUNG!

YOUNG wants to scream. He is almost totally submerged now... WATER RISES ABOVE HIS MOUTH, HIS SCREAMS TURNS TO SALT WATER GURGLES!


INT. LIVING QUARTERS. BUNKROOM - MORNING

Water drips on YOUNG’S FACE

Drip. Drip. Drip.

He opens his eyes. He sits up in his bed.

OLD is disrobing in the mirror. As reverential as before, only even more careful –- he’s drunk.
 
11.


OLD
Shingles.

YOUNG looks up. Water gets into his eye.

OLD waddles to his bed, his pants around his ankles.

OLD (CONT’D)
Tend to ‘em after the cistern. And the lamp, she needs oil.

He flops down on the sagging mattress. Asleep instantly.

YOUNG
Aye, sir.


EXT. PILOT ROCK. PATHWAY - DAY

YOUNG lugs a heavy BAG OF CHLORINE up the incline of the island.

It’s hard work.

The wind blows like hell.


EXT. PILOT ROCK. CISTERN - DAY

YOUNG, cigarette in his mouth, opens the hatch of a brick water tank: It lets out a putrid stench that knocks YOUNG’S face back a few inches.

He tosses away the cigarette and covers his mouth and nose with the handkerchief around his neck.

He looks inside: It’s full of mold and frothy sludge. It’s what he’s been drinking.

He pours in the chlorine. It slowly sinks.

YOUNG drops in the mixing stick and swirls the water around.
It looks sort of beautiful.


EXT. LIVING QUARTERS. ROOF – DAY

YOUNG hammers shake shingles. He holds nails in his teeth.

Hammer. Hammer. Hammer.

He balances precariously on a rickety rung ladder. The wind blows hard, nearly knocking him off. It’s monotonous work, but he takes it seriously.
 
12.


He looks up to the lighthouse: Curtains drawn in the lamp room.

He rips out several rotted shingles... The roof boards below are ravaged with rot, too. Yep, here’s that leaky hole.

He leans in...

HE CAN SEE THROUGH A HOLE IN THE ROOF:

OLD is asleep. But he’s moving...

YOUNG leans in closer...

OLD is softly HUMPING his sweaty mattress, just gently thrusting his hips. It’s subtle. A reflexive motion.

YOUNG watches.

Hold.


EXT. SUPPLY SHED - DAY

YOUNG opens a wooden door that almost falls off its hinges:

The shack is full of sacks of potatoes, barrels of dried fish, shelves of canned meats and vegetables and fruits.

Paper-wrapped parcels, wooden crates, casks, rope.


EXT. COAL HOUSE - DAY

YOUNG opens the door: Coal. Heaps of it.


EXT. COAL HOUSE - LATER

He loads up a wheelbarrow overfull with coal.

He pushes the wheelbarrow down the rock. (Needless to say, the wheel squeaks.)


EXT. PILOT ROCK. PATHWAY - CONTINUOUS

He keeps pushing. One wrong step could cause the whole pile
to tumble off of the wheelbarrow and down the island....


EXT. FOG SIGNAL HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

He makes his way to the door with the wheelbarrow...
 
13.


A SEAGULL stands in front of the old door, guarding it.

YOUNG flaps his hand, trying to scare it.

THE GULL SQUAWKS. It turns its head, revealing: A MISSING EYE. The empty socket is gruesome and twisted. A war wound.

YOUNG is motionless, staring at the strange deformity...

SUDDENLY, THE GULL YEOWS, LUNGING at him, clicking its beak.

Instinctively, YOUNG HURLS a lump of coal at it...

He misses...

THE GULL mews this time, looks with its single eye, and flies away.

YOUNG watches the bird’s path...

It flies past the lighthouse...

The OLD man is looking down at him from the gallery, puffing his pipe. Watching.


INT. LIGHTHOUSE. OIL ROOM - DAY

The oil room is at the bottom of the staircase. YOUNG looks up...

That is one tall staircase.

The chains of the light’s clockwork weights look sinister as they dangle down the center of the iron spiral steps and their shadows creep across the stone wall. They clink and clank, echoing ominously...

YOUNG looks at the OIL DRUMS hiding beneath the stairs. They are much larger and more imposing than the heavy chlorine bag.


INT. LIGHTHOUSE. TOWER STAIRS - DAY

Clunk. YOUNG lugs an immense OIL DRUM up the steps.

...

...

Clunk.

...
 
14.


...

Clunk.


INT. LIGHTHOUSE. MACHINE ROOM - DAY

Finally, YOUNG reaches the top of the stairs. The oil drum SLAMS down. His muscles tremor, sweat drips.

He looks at the hatch to the LANTERN ROOM above...

He is drawn to it...

Slowly, he reaches toward the handle...

He pushes...

It’s closed. Stuck. Locked?

OLD (O.S.)
You don’t go in there!

OLD startles YOUNG. Where did he come from?

OLD emerges from the shadows: walk-drag, walk-drag, walk-drag.

YOUNG
Oil, sir.

Says YOUNG, feeling somehow caught.

He steps away from the drum, showing it to the old man, trying to hide an ounce of pride. He wipes the sweat from his brow, panting.

OLD limps around him, smoking his pipe, stopping short of blowing the smoke in YOUNG’S face.

OLD
Tired?

YOUNG
No, sir.

Says YOUNG, still panting.

OLD throws a small, empty, ONE-GALLON BRASS OIL CANISTER at him.

YOUNG CATCHES it awkwardly.
 
15.


OLD
Use this next time. Save you a

helluva lotta trouble.

YOUNG
--

OLD
Catch yer breath, lad.

Pause.

Then bring that drum back down the ladderwell where ye found it. ‘Less yer fixin’ to burn the whole light down.

OLD climbs the ladder to the LANTERN ROOM.

YOUNG
Aye, sir.

OLD slams the door.


INT. LIVING QUARTERS. GALLEY - NIGHT

Scrod and potatoes again.

OLD pours himself a dram. YOUNG has his water.

OLD
Should pale death with treble dread make the ocean caves our bed, God who hear'st the surges roll, deign to save the suppliant soul.

They drink. YOUNG winces a little. OLD is satisfied and starts eating.

OLD (CONT’D)
(between chewing)

Still tastes o’the heads?

YOUNG won’t nod yes.

They eat in silence.

OLD looks up at YOUNG... YOUNG ignores him.

OLD (CONT’D)
Ah, find some chirk in ye, lad. Now is the time for gab and chatter. Ye best be enjoying it.

(MORE)
 
16.

OLD (CONT’D)
Come a fortnight, the doldrums set in and the brace of us’ll be wantin’ to be ever silent as the tomb. Even to clap eyes on each other... It’ll make ye hotter than hell!

YOUNG
I ain’t much fer talking.

OLD MAN
Reckon yer the first?

YOUNG
No, sir. I don’t.

OLD
You ain’t. You ain’t. Aye, the Chicopee, a fine-un, she was. Clean-built and trig-lookin’! None more fleet in ‘64 than she. We were on the breaks of a mutiny, we was... and why, ask ye? Why? What’s the
terrible part of a sailor’s life,
ask ye, lad? T’isn’t the hard
workin’, nay, no, ‘tis when the
workin’ stops that yer twixt wind
and water. Doldrums. Doldrums.
Eviler than the Devil. Boredom
makes men to villains... And the

water goes so quick, lad... vanished. And what’s the answer? What be the cure? The only med’cine is drink. Drink, lad! Keeps them sailors happy, keeps ‘em agreeable, keeps ’em calm, keeps em–-

YOUNG
Stupid.

Pause. The two men stare at each other for a moment.

OLD ERUPTS INTO A FIT OF LAUGHTER. He laughs so hard that he runs through every conceivable sound. Is he drunk already?

YOUNG smiles, it’s hard not to at the unique laughter.

OLD pours another and toasts.

OLD
I know’d there were an old

tar spirit somewheres in ye, lad.

YOUNG starts to say something... but he stops himself.
 
17.


Pause.

OLD (CONT’D)
Out with it, lad.

YOUNG
What... Why’d yer last keeper

leave?

OLD
Him? My second?

YOUNG nods yes, eating.

OLD (CONT’D)
A fine sea farin’ man, he were.

Pause.

Died.

YOUNG
--?

OLD
Aye, went mad, he did. First a strangeness. A quietude. Then wild fancies struck him. Ravin’ ‘bout sirens, merfolk, bad omens and the like. No more sense left in him than a hen’s tooth. In the end, he believed there were some enchantment in the light.

YOUNG
--?

OLD
He notioned St. Elmo did cast his very fire into it. Salvation, said he.

YOUNG laughs.

YOUNG
Tall tales.

He rolls a cigarette.

OLD takes another drink. Slowly, his mood becomes somber.

OLD
I saw ye sparrin’ with a gull.
 
18.


YOUNG licks the paper.

OLD (CONT’D)
Best ye leave ‘em be. Bad luck to

kill a sea bird.

YOUNG laughs.

YOUNG
(laughs)

More tall tales?

As YOUNG starts to put the cigarette to his lips... OLD GETS UP AND SLAPS HIM HARD IN THE FACE, out of nowhere!

YOUNG stands in shock, knocking back his chair to the floor... He looks at OLD, stunned:

OLD IS ANGRY. DEAD SERIOUS.

OLD
Bad luck to kill a sea bird.

Pause.

OLD breathes. He calms down a bit. He realizes how strange that was.

OLD (CONT’D)
Pay me no mind, lad. None. Fix us
up some coffee. Long night ahead.

Drop o’coffee‘ll do us good.

OLD doesn’t need to say he’s drunk.

YOUNG
Aye, sir.

OLD now looks shaken. Terrified. A shell of himself.
More frightening than his outburst of anger was.


INT. LIVING QUARTERS. BUNKROOM – NIGHT

YOUNG lies in bed, smoking a cigarette. Reading the manual. Can’t get comfortable. Restless. He holds the CARVED MERMAID in his hand, not really thinking about it.

The CLOCK ticks monotonously.

Hold.

OUT OF FOCUS IN THE BACK GROUND: A SEAGULL lands on the window.
 
19.


Pause.

THE GULL starts tapping on the window.

Tap. Tap.

YOUNG hears it.

Tap.

He turns... Just as he turns, CAMERA racks focus, THE SEAGULL has already flown away.

YOUNG feels uneasy.


INT. STORAGE SHED - NIGHT

YOUNG’S head moves up and down, shaking slightly. He is hiding in the shadows of the shed. The sound of rustling cloth and a clinking belt buckle are heard. CAMERA BOOMS DOWN...

He’s masturbating.


EXT. LIVING QUARTERS - A BIT LATER THAT NIGHT

YOUNG smokes a cigarette, leaning against the clapboard wall.
Relieved. Calm.

He's only visible when the LIGHT hits the quarters, otherwise, the soft glow of his cigarette indicates YOUNG’S location in the dark.

YOUNG looks at the little cigarette ember illuminating his hand. It's very weak.

He looks up to the LIGHT:


INT/EXT. LANTERN ROOM/LIGHTHOUSE GALLERY - CONTINUOUS

FLASH: OLD is up against the lens.
BLACK.
FLASH: OLD’s arms are outstretched.
BLACK.
FLASH: Is he hugging the lens?
BLACK.
FLASH: He’s gone.
BLACK.
FLASH: OLD is on the GALLERY. Surveying. He pulls his suspenders over his shoulders, as if getting dressed after a night with a woman. He looks below.
 
20.


EXT. LIVING QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS

YOUNG is hiding, skulking below the eaves of the roof, wary of the man above. He puts out his cigarette.


EXT. PILOT ROCK – DAY

EXTREMELY WIDE SHOT: It rains. The wind is something awful.
THE LIGHTHOUSE flashes.

YOUNG pushes the wheelbarrow through the storm, an oilcloth tarp over the coal. He struggles through the mud...

Hold.


INT. MACHINE ROOM - LATER

OLD watches YOUNG polishing the brass. It pours outside.

OLD
(almost singing)
Oh what be the bane of a
lightkeeper's life?
What cause him to worry, to
struggle and strife,
What make him use cuss words, and
beat at his wife?
‘Tis Brasswork.

What make him look ghastly
consumptive and thin?
What rob him of health, of his
vigor and vim?
And cause him despair and drives
him to sin.'
‘Tis Brasswork.

OLD giggles at himself. Stops. Writes in his LOGBOOK.

YOUNG sees that out of the corner of his eye. He keeps polishing... harder.

OLD (CONT’D)
The oil containers I polish until, My poor back is broken, aching; and still...


EXT. PILOT ROCK – DAY

YOUNG pushes the wheelbarrow through the storm (now in the other direction). It’s more difficult than before...
 
21.


He’s struggling... The wheelbarrow falls...

Coal scatters all over the place. YOUNG stands still.

He wants to scream.


INT. LIVING QUARTERS. GALLEY – NIGHT

OLD and YOUNG eat their scrod and potatoes in silence.

A STORM RAGES JUST OUTSIDE THEIR FLIMSY WALLS.

Tension.

Hold.

Thunder claps.


EXT. LIGHTHOUSE TOWER – DAY

ANGLE ON: OLD is looking down from the gallery of the light, he smokes his pipe. The sun shines behind him.

CAMERA BOOMS DOWN TO: YOUNG, sitting on a KITCHEN CHAIR HELD UP BY THREE LONG ROPES, whitewashing the tower, some 50 feet above the ground. His bucket of whitewash dangles on another rope.

OLD
Keep ‘em still, lad.

YOUNG can’t. As usual, the wind blows wildly.

YOUNG
Aye, sir.

His "paintbrush," a stick with a horsehair brush at the end, shakes in his hands.

OLD
Whitewash must be even, lad. Bright! Shinin’! Like a silver whorehouse token. Give ‘em sailors a proper daymark.

OLD lets the rope slip a bit. It truly scares YOUNG.

Whitewash drips onto YOUNG’S face and clothes. He yells:

YOUNG
They're not going to see it in a

Goddamn storm!
 
22.


OLD laughs.

OLD
They will after! And'll be glad to see it! Keep your temper now, lad. It’s fine work. Yer makin’ high marks in me logbook. Them’s gospel!

“Logbook?” thinks YOUNG. He stares at Old... for too long.

OLD (CONT’D)
I'll drop ye down a few feet.

He unties the rope on one end... YOUNG slips quickly.

YOUNG
Easy.

OLD
Never been in better hands.

Another shift: HARD.

OLD ties the rope. Goes to another side.

Unties. SHIFT! Further than the last one. THE WHITEWASH SPLASHES.

YOUNG
Easy!

YOUNG thrashes in the wind. The rope around the plank loosens...

OLD
Quit yer flailing, lad.

YOUNG
I ain’t!

OLD
Y’are!

The ropes start to unravel...

OLD (CONT’D)
Keep still!

YOUNG
I am--

YOUNG falls to the ground!

BLACK.
 
23.


EXT. FOOT OF THE LIGHT TOWER – LATER

YOUNG comes to...

He's covered in whitewash.

How long was he out? He looks around... THE KITCHEN CHAIR is shattered -- no more than kindling... OLD is nowhere to be seen...

But THE SEAGULL with the missing eye is there. It's pecking at his legs, scavenging at fresh meat.

YOUNG
Shoo.

It pecks. TAP. TAP. TAP. On his leg.

YOUNG (CONT’D)
You! Get!

It persists. Pecking. Biting. Slicing with its sharp beak. TAP. TAP. TAP. Damn! It hurts!

YOUNG KICKS IT HARD!

THE GULL falls to the ground for a moment.

Pause.

Is it dead?

YOUNG creeps to it...

Suddenly, THE GULL flies away, mocking him with keks and yeows.


INT. LIVING QUARTERS. GALLEY - ANOTHER NIGHT

OLD sits on the same chair he’s been sitting in for the past weeks. YOUNG sits on an UPTURNED SOAPBOX.

YOUNG pours OLD a drink. Passes it to him.

OLD
Thankee, lad.

YOUNG
Winslow.

OLD
--?
 
24.


YOUNG
Ephraim Winslow. These last two
weeks, I’d... well, I’d like it,

sir, if you’d call me by my name.

OLD
Listen to ye, giving orders, lad.

YOUNG
Winslow.

OLD
Alright, alright... suits me just as fine, Ephraim Winslow. So, what brung such a one as you to this damnèd rock?

YOUNG
Such as what?

OLD
Pretty as a picture.

YOUNG
--

OLD laughs heartily.

OLD
Only joshing, lad, only josh--

YOUNG
Winslow.

OLD
Winslow -– What brings you to this rock, Ephraim Winslow? What was yer work afore?

YOUNG
Timber.

OLD
Timber...

YOUNG
Big timber. Up north. Canada ways.

OLD
Hudson Bay outfit?

YOUNG
The same.
 
25.


OLD
True what they say? “Forest far as the eye can see.”

YOUNG
Yessir. Spruce, tamarack... white
pine. “Bush,” them folk up there

call it.

OLD
Had enough of trees, that it, then?

YOUNG
Yessir.

OLD
Can’t say I blame ye. I hearn tell about that life. Hard going. Workin’ one man harder than two horses, they say. No thankee. The sea, she’s the only situation wantin’ fer me.

YOUNG
Miss it?

OLD
Miss it? I ain’t never know’d

anything but it.

YOUNG
Sailing.

OLD
Ah... Aye. Aye.

OLD sees the sea life clearly in his eyes. The stories he must have.

OLD (CONT’D)
Ain’t nothing what can touch it.

He snaps himself out of it:

OLD (CONT’D)
But can’t be draggin’ me old stump about...

(Referring to his limp)

Nay... not worth the trouble... now
I’m a wickie and a wickie I is.

(MORE)
 
26.

OLD (CONT’D)
I’m damn-well wedded to this here light, and she’s been a finer, truer, quieter wife than any a live-blooded woman.

YOUNG
Ever married?

OLD
Thirteen Christmases at sea...
little ‘uns at home. She never

forgave it.

Pause.

‘Tis fer the better.

Pause.

It’s clear that OLD has regrets. But rather than dwell on a painful past, he changes the subject.

OLD (CONT’D)
Since we’re getting too friendly, Ephraim Winslow, tell me, what’s a timber man want with being a wickie? Not enough quiet for ye up north? Sawdust itching yer nethers? Foreman found ye too high-tempered for carrying an axe?

That last comment rubs YOUNG the wrong way, but he doesn’t give in to the feeling.

YOUNG
Like you say, just had enough of

trees, I guess.

YOUNG focuses on his cigarette.

Pause.

Lights. Draws. OLD looks him over suspiciously, as he lights his pipe.

YOUNG (CONT’D)
Nothin’ wrong with a man startin’

fresh, lookin’ to earn a living––

OLD
No...
 
27.


YOUNG
...like any man, tryin’ to settle
down quiet-like with some

earnings...

(pause)

I read a man could earn six hundred and thirty –– I read one thousand dollars a year if he’s willing to tend a light far off shore... the further away, the more he earns. I read that, and hell, I said, yessir. Work. Save my earnings. Soon enough, I’ll raise my own roof, somewheres up country, with no one to tell me “what for”... That’s all.

YOUNG smiles. He thinks he is doing a pretty good job covering up his fear that OLD may sense more than he lets on. The cigarette helps.

OLD
Same ol’ borin’ story, eh?

YOUNG
You asked.

Pause.

YOUNG takes another drag.

YOUNG (CONT’D)
Say, why’s it bad luck to kill a

gull?

OLD puffs his pipe gravely.

OLD
In ‘em’s the souls o’ sailors what met their maker.

YOUNG tries not to scoff again. OLD senses it.

OLD (CONT’D)
You a praying man, Winslow?

YOUNG
Not as often as I might. But I’m
God fearin’ -– if that’s what yer

askin’.
 
28.


YOUNG tries to take a drag of his cigarette. He can't.
It’s gone out... but he just lit it...

OLD
Russian Tar once told me: yer cigarette cinder goes out, there be someone somewhere’s a-thinkin’ bad thoughts of ye.

YOUNG looks at OLD.

OLD (CONT’D)
They be a-cursing yer name.

YOUNG re-lights the cigarette and takes a drag, not knowing what to make of that.

OLD (CONT’D)
A toast to Ephraim Winslow, the God fearin’ man. Let ‘im settle down with none to tell ‘em “what for,” that his cinders always stay burnin’, and let fear never abandon ‘im.

OLD toasts and drinks.

YOUNG
Amen.

YOUNG feels uneasy.


INT. LIGHTHOUSE. VARIOUS - DAY

-	YOUNG sweeps the stairs.

-	YOUNG removes the weight from the clockwork chain.

-	YOUNG winds the clockwork mechanism.

-	YOUNG cleans the clockwork. Leaning in a strange position, his TOBACCO POUCH falls to the ground.

-	OLD writes in his LOGBOOK.


INT. LIVING QUARTERS. BUNKROOM - NIGHT

YOUNG is tossing and turning in bed. Restless. Hot. Sweaty.

The sound of the waves crashing on shore is relentless.

The CLOCK ticks monotonously.
 
29.


He tries to find a cool spot on the bed.

He turns his pillow over... kicks off the linens...

It doesn’t work. He sits up. He puts his hand behind his ear... no cigarette.

He goes to his shirt pocket hanging on the foot of the bed rail...

The TOBACCO POUCH isn’t there.

YOUNG
Shit.


INT. LIGHTHOUSE. MACHINE ROOM - NIGHT

The POUCH rests on top of the spinning clockwork. YOUNG grabs it and quickly starts to head down stairs, but...

Something stops him.

A feeling. A question.

The clockwork spins, the light hums on its brass track, the sea and wind sing their lilting song.

He looks up at the LIGHT swirling magically, dancing through the cast iron grates. It is beautiful. Hypnotic. THE LIGHT DRAWS HIM IN...

But there’s something else... another noise...

Whispering.

Above.

In the LANTERN ROOM.

YOUNG tries to look through the iron grates: the bright LIGHT
of the lamp makes it hard to see... he needs to get closer...

He grabs a chair from the shadows and stands on it.

He listens.


INT. LIGHTHOUSE. METAL GRATES - CONTINUOUS

The whispering is more audible, though hard to define. He listens, trying to block out the white noise of the light:

It’s OLD alright, but YOUNG can only hear bits of whispers.
 
30.


OLD
(whispered)

The light... seed...

There’s another noise, now that his ear is more focused.
It’s a sticky, sweaty, slapping of flesh. Constant...

It’s familiar, but he can’t quite place it.

He puts his face closer to the metal grates and through glimpses of the light and shadow above, he sees:

PIECES OF OLD, IN AND OUT OF SHADOW. HIS HAIRY, BARREL-SHAPED TORSO IS VIBRATING. HIS RIGHT ARM IS MOVING. VIGOROUSLY. UP. DOWN. UP. DOWN.

Is he...?

JUST THEN, WHITE, VISCOUS FLUID DRIPS FROM THE GRATES...

YOUNG QUICKLY AVOIDS IT IN DISGUST.

HE LOOKS UP AGAIN...

A HUGE, SLIMY, TRANSLUCENT SQUID’S TENTACLE SLITHERS ACROSS THE IRONWORK...

...IT DISAPPEARS INTO THE DARKNESS.

OLD (CONT’D)
(louder)

Veritas...

YOUNG’s eyes widen.


INT. LIVING QUARTERS. GALLEY - DAY

YOUNG pumps water into a cup in the sink.

He drinks. Pumps again. Drinks. Goes to pump again, but something stops him...

At the bottom of the cup is a dark film.

He sweeps it up with a finger and looks: strange.

YOUNG pumps the water once again... it makes a strange gurgling sound... the water is more and more tainted, almost black.
 
31.


EXT. PILOT ROCK. CISTERN - DAY

THE CISTERN'S HATCH IS OPEN! SEAGULLS clamor around it.

YOUNG
Get! Get!

He shoos them away, but as he gets closer to the cistern, he hears flapping wings inside. He looks in:

A SEAGULL is trying to escape –- pathetically, desperately.
It looks like the other wing is broken, it just hangs there.
Many DEAD GULLS float in the bloody cistern around it.

Just then, THE ONE-EYED gull swoops in and starts attacking the gull in the cistern.

YOUNG tries to intervene...

ONE EYE attacks YOUNG’S face!

YOUNG tears it away in wild rage...

He mercilessly beats THE GULL to the ground...

Over and over and over...

Until it is just a bloody pulp of feathers...

THE ONE-EYED GULL is dead.

YOUNG breathes heavily. Guilty.

Hold.

The wind blows.

CAMERA BOOMS UP THE LIGHTHOUSE TOWER, past the gallery, past the lamp, past the conical roof to...

THE WEATHERVANE: THE NEEDLE POINTS WEST...

Suddenly, the wind blows... THE NEEDLE starts to jiggle a bit...

The wind picks up... THE NEEDLE spins around, and around, and around...

It settles. Jiggling slightly in the wind, THE NEEDLE POINTS HARD: EAST.
 
32.


INT. LIVING QUARTERS. BUNKROOM – LATER

YOUNG stands in the open doorway of the bunkroom, wiping his face with a handkerchief.

YOUNG
Cistern was open, sir and...

He sees OLD sobbing into his pillow and blankets. Is he asleep? It's a strangely vulnerable sight.

YOUNG doesn’t know what to do.

Hold.


INT. LIGHTHOUSE. MACHINE ROOM – DAY

YOUNG’S face is reflected in the shining brasswork. His expression is still affected by the previous two scenes. He spits on the brass and keeps polishing.

OLD watches YOUNG work, writing in his logbook.

OLD
Wind’s changed.

YOUNG
Good riddance.

OLD
Don’t be so darn foolish. It’s the calm afore the storm, Winslow. She were a gentle westerly wind yer cursing. Only feels roughly ‘cause you don’t know nothin’ bout nothin’ and there ain’t no trees on this here rock like your Hudson Bay bush. Nor’Easterly wind’ll come soon a-blowin’ like Gabriel’s horn. Best board up them windows.

YOUNG
Aye, sir.

OLD
‘Twill keep steady afore the tender comes in the morn, I ‘spect... but there’s dirty weather knocking about.

YOUNG won’t look OLD in the eye.
 
33.


OLD (CONT’D)
Somethin’ stirring in ye?

Yer gettin’ off this island tomorry Winslow, don’t start grudgen me now.

YOUNG
No, sir.

OLD
Keeping secrets, are ye?

YOUNG
No, sir.


Pause.

I could use a hand with them boards is all.


EXT. LIVING QUARTERS – DAY

YOUNG boards up the windows. OLD helps.

OLD (O.S.)
Now then, I’ve a surprise.


EXT. PILOT ROCK. SHORE – DAY

YOUNG stands precariously on a rock, pulling a ROPE that leads out into the water. OLD watches him.

OLD
Pull, pull, me good lad. Pull,

Winslow!

YOUNG pulls a wooden LOBSTER POT out of the water.

YOUNG SMILES. So does OLD.

OLD (CONT’D)
Look at ‘em! Better than fin

fishin’!


INT. LIVING QUARTERS. GALLEY – NIGHT

Mutilated LOBSTER SHELLS are piled up on the plates. By the look on YOUNG & OLD’S faces, it was a satisfying meal.
 
34.


OLD pours two cups of his grog. Passes one to YOUNG.

OLD
‘Tis no crime to take a snort now. A clear night. And being our last afore relief, I never know’d an inspector what wouldn’t turn no blind eye, and I won’t take “no” for an answer.

YOUNG gives in. He takes the cup.

YOUNG
Should pale death and treble dread make the... uh...

Pause. He can’t remember the rest.

Ah hell –– to relief!

They clink.

OLD
And how!

They drink.

OLD pours another round.

They drink.

OLD pours another round.

They drink.


-LATER

YOUNG AND OLD are singing and pounding on the table.

OLD AND YOUNG
(singing)
Hurrah, we're homeward bound,

Hurrah, we're homeward bound!

OLD
(singing)

When we're arrived on Bedford docks Them bloomers all comin’round in flocks

Them pretty girls, we hear 'em say "Here comes Jack with his nine-month pay"
 
35.


OLD AND YOUNG
(singing)
Hurrah, we're homeward bound,

Hurrah, we're homeward bound!


-LATER

They keep drinking.

OLD smokes a cigarette. YOUNG smokes OLD’S pipe.

OLD
...and a pretty lass, she were, takin’ off her bonnet... but as I says, I’d broke me leg, and banged myself all up. It was to a nuns' hospital... All of them nuns were Catholics, I tell ye...

They laugh.

OLD (CONT’D)
Aye, but I never went to Salem since without hoping that I should see her, for beddin’ down wer’nt the same since. I don't know but if I was a-going to begin my life over again... well, womenfolk are apt to be dreadful ashamed of it, anyhow.

YOUNG
You feel shame when you lie with a woman?

OLD
I ain’t shamed of nothing.

Pause. They laugh.

OLD (CONT’D)
Well, I’ll say it... I might even miss ye, Ephraim Winslow, yer fastly a true blue wickie in the making, you is. Thought one night you was bound to split me skull in twain, but yer a good-un. Why you’ll be workin’ the lamp in no time –

YOUNG
Why haven’t I?

Pause.
 
36.


OLD
What?

YOUNG
The light?

OLD
I’m the keeper, lad.

YOUNG
The... I ain’t... the manual says--

OLD
My log is the only book on this

rock--

YOUNG	OLD (CONT'D)
I mean, I’m a wickie, you	‘Tis Gospel!
says, but I ain’t trimmed one

wick once--

OLD (CONT’D)
I’m the keeper of the light, lad,

the keeper of the light--
 

YOUNG
I ain’t –- the book says we alternate-–


OLD pours himself another drink.
 


OLD (CONT'D)
I keep the light, don’t concern yerslef with the light! Mine, lad!

 

YOUNG laughs. The tension goes away.

YOUNG
Have it your way... uh... Say, I
never... I don’t know yer name.

OLD
Thomas Wake.

YOUNG looks odd, troubled.

YOUNG
Thomas?

OLD
Thomas Wake, aye.

YOUNG seems a little disturbed.

OLD (CONT’D)
Call me Tom.
 
37.


OLD pours them another round.

YOUNG
To my friend Tom, and to getting

off this goddamned rock!

They drink, spilling a bit of the liquor down their chins.
YOUNG snaps out of whatever seemed to be bothering him.


INT. LIVING QUARTERS. BUNKROOM – NIGHT

YOUNG stumbles around, undressing as he makes his way to the bed.

He leaves clothes here and there.

He struggles to get his boots off. He can’t. Too drunk.

He sits and breathes.

He tries again. He gets one off.

He tries the other... no use... He pulls harder, it comes loose, but the force is so great, YOUNG hits his head on a lamp, mounted on the wall...

He and the lamp crash to the floor. He passes out with his pants around his ankles. His hair absorbs the kerosene of the broken lamp.


INT. LIVING QUARTERS. BUNKROOM – MORNING

YOUNG wakes up.

He is so hung over. He wants to die.

He needs water...

The pitcher... the basin... both empty. He knocked them over the night before. When did that happen?

He looks down the corridor. OLD is asleep on the kitchen table.

He goes to his chamber pot: it’s full of piss and shit.

He goes to Old's: piss and shit.
 
38.


EXT. PILOT ROCK – LATER THAT MORNING

YOUNG wears his oilskins, smokes a cigarette, and carries the full piss pots. THE WIND FIGHTS HIM. So does the hangover.

THE GALE HAS ARRIVED. IT'S STRONG. RELENTLESS. IT ALMOST KNOCKS HIM TO THE GROUND.


EXT. PILOT ROCK. CLIFFS - LATER

YOUNG stands over the cliffside. Fog is creeping in.

He tosses the contents of the CHAMBER POTS off the cliffs...

IT ALL SPLASHES BACK IN HIS FACE.

YOUNG
Fuck!

He drops the chamber pots... they tumble to the rocks.

YOUNG (CONT’D)
FUCK!!

It starts to rain, of course.


EXT. PILOT ROCK. PATHWAY – LATER THAT MORNING

YOUNG hauls coal through the rain.


INT. FOG SIGNAL HOUSE –	LATER THAT MORNING

YOUNG stokes the fire. The signal is up and running.

He shovels more coal.
