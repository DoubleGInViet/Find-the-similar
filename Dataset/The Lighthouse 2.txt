EXT. PILOT ROCK – LATER THAT MORNING

YOUNG stumbles around the slippery rocks, pushing an empty wheelbarrow. Rain pissing on him. The hangover beating down upon his head.

THE FOGHORN blasts relentlessly.

As he rounds a corner, he sees something WHITE in the black rocks of the shore... He walks a few more paces...

It is a BODY, lying still.

He gasps... He drops the wheelbarrow and runs toward it!
 
39.


THE FOGHORN blasts.

As he gets closer, it appears to be a WOMAN... A NUDE WOMAN washed up on the rocks. White legs and arms splayed out.

He calls for Old, but he can’t hear him.

He runs closer.

THE FOGHORN blasts again.

THE WOMAN appears to be DEAD, entangled in seaweed.

YOUNG has to save her if he can.

YOUNG goes to his knees...

Wipes seaweed away from her face...

SHE IS BEAUTIFUL. The most beautiful woman he has ever seen.

The blood rushes to his head. His heart throbs. He looks her over. He wants to touch her. He hesitates... but he does.

He checks her pulse...

Puts his head to her chest: Dead.

Slowly, he touches her cheek, then her mouth...

He moves his hand down her body, in the horror and grief of her death, but also fascinated by her beauty, her perfect feminine shape... He makes his way past her breasts, to her ribs...

Her ribs seem to have wounds -- deep slices. They aren’t bloody. They look almost like... GILLS.

He moves his hand past her waist, toward her genitals, then he sees:

SHE HAS A FISH’S TAIL! SHE IS A MERMAID!!

He is frozen in terror. Then he looks back at her face...

She opens her eyes and smiles at him.

She raises her arms, wanting his embrace...

YOUNG opens his mouth to scream in horror...

THE FOGHORN blasts!
 
40.


YOUNG runs away, fast as he can, flailing, stumbling over himself. He has almost no control over his body as he hurls himself across the island, his screaming drowned out by the FOGHORN.


INT. LIVING QUARTERS. GALLEY – MOMENTS LATER

YOUNG is out of breath from screaming. Wild eyed.

OLD
What’r ye splittin’ yer lungs fer?

YOUNG
I--

OLD
Ye smell o’ shit. Best swab this

mess afore the tender comes.

YOUNG
I--

OLD
Ye do as yer told, lad! The

quarters are dire.

YOUNG
Aye, sir.


INT. LIVING QUARTERS. GALLEY - LATER

THE GALLEY IS CLEAN. Well, as clean as it can be.


INT. LIVING QUARTERS. BUNKROOM – LATER

THE BUNKROOM is orderly. Mattresses rolled up. Everything is in place. The CLOCK ticks monotonously.


EXT. PILOT ROCK. NEAR THE SHORE – LATER

OLD and YOUNG are in their topcoats, their gunny sacks over their shoulders, their ditty boxes by their sides. They look out to sea, waiting for the tender.

It rains. The wind blows.

Hold.

The rain begins to pour.
 
41.


INT. LIVING QUARTERS. GALLEY – NIGHT

OLD AND YOUNG sit at the table perfectly still. Drenched.

The storm outside is something biblical.

Very, very long pause.

YOUNG
Tender didn’t come.

Long pause.


EXT. PILOT ROCK – NIGHT

ANGLE ON: Huge waves crash.


EXT. PILOT ROCK. CLIFFS - NIGHT

ANGLE ON: Enormous waves crash.


EXT. PILOT ROCK. BOATHOUSE - NIGHT

Rain pours. A deluge.

OLD is in his oilskins. He stands like a magician in front of the BOATHOUSE, facing the waves. He holds his right hand over the sea with two fingers extended. He holds his bottle in the other hand.

He counts the waves as they crash onto the shore.

OLD
...Four ...Five ...Six

The waves are growing higher!

OLD (CONT’D)
...Seven ...Eight ...Go down!

He makes the sign of the cross (like a Catholic) on the ninth wave!

THE WAVE FLOUNDERS AND DIES...

OLD smiles at himself. I’ve still got it, he thinks. He takes a swig from his bottle...

Did he really make the wave descend? Or is it a coincidence?

Regardless, the wind comes back with a vengeance ...
 
42.


Behind him, the DORY that’s tied up wracks in the wind, beating against the sides of the boat house.

The foghorn calls. The light flashes.

OLD (CONT’D)
(singing “Blood Red
Roses”)
‘Tis frost and snow and winter
storm.
(beat)
Go down you blood red roses, go
down!
(beat)
And there’s many a ship lost round
Cape Horn.
(beat)
Go down you blood red roses, go
down!
(beat)
Oh, you pinks and posies...

EIGHT... Go down!

NINE! He makes the sign of the cross.

OLD (CONT’D)
Well, the captain he's o’er come
with fear.
(takes a swig)

Go down –-

SUDDENLY, A MASSIVE WAVE CRASHES OVER OLD, KNOCKING HIM OFF HIS FEET.

HE TRIES TO STAND, TO CATCH HIS BREATH...

HE IS TERRIFIED...

ANOTHER WAVE HITS HIM...


INT. FOG SIGNAL HOUSE - NIGHT

ANGLE ON: THE BAROMETER. The needle is falling. It falls from “RAIN” to “STORM.”

YOUNG has his shirt off, shoveling coal. Sweaty.

THE FOGHORN blasts.

YOUNG catches his breath. He has one of OLD’S LIQUOR BOTTLES on his chair.

He uncorks the bottle of liquor. Smells it.
 
43.


He thinks hard about drinking it.

No.

He corks it.

YOUNG turns...

OLD is in the doorway soaking wet, and crazed.

YOUNG wants to ask what happened, but decides it’s better not to.

YOUNG somehow feels too exposed without his shirt on.

OLD
(yelling over the noise)

THE DAMP’S GOT TO THE PROVISIONS.

YOUNG
(yelling over the noise)

WHAT?

OLD
(yelling over the noise)

THE DAMP’S GOT TO THE PROVISIONS!


EXT. PILOT ROCK. PATHWAY – LATER

THE TWO walk through the storm.


INT. LIVING QUARTERS. GALLEY - LATER

OLD is shutting the door. YOUNG is shaking off the rain.

OLD
The damp‘s got to the foodstuffs.

The salt cod is out.

YOUNG
Out?

OLD
Blasted. Gone to rot.

YOUNG
Praised be.

OLD
Now will ye hear me?
 
44.


YOUNG
Hear what?

OLD
That we best be rationing.

YOUNG
Rationing?

OLD
Insubordinate again--

YOUNG
It’s only been one day.

OLD
The Devil’s tail!

YOUNG can’t figure out OLD’S train of thought.

YOUNG
Look, maybe the tender, maybe she did come. We missed her, is all. I can take the dory out--

OLD
Weeks, Winslow.

YOUNG
What?

OLD
What d’ye mean, what?

YOUNG
Weeks?

YOUNG is beginning to feel confused, afraid.

OLD
Weeks, aye. Weeks.

YOUNG
We slept in. Dead drunk.

OLD
It’s been weeks ago since we missed her, Winslow. And I’ve been asking ye to ration fer weeks now, too, and you’ve kept barking at me like a mad dog, saying you can “take the dory out”--
 
45.


YOUNG
Now look--

OLD
Don’t be losing yer head now.

YOUNG
This ain’t funny.

OLD
No, it ain’t. And I ain’t wanting
to be stranded here with some

damned lunatic.

YOUNG
Stranded?

OLD
That’s what I said.

YOUNG
I thought you said relief was

coming.

OLD
If we can wait out this storm.

YOUNG
The tender is coming.

OLD
In ‘75 ‘Ol Striker were marooned here for seven long months, he was. The storm died on the mainland but here, waters were too rageful neither to launch nor land.

YOUNG
Yer just trying to scare me.

YOUNG is worried he is losing his mind. Or is it OLD who’s losing it?

OLD
Look at ye. Pretending. But ye well-know yer lot.


EXT. PILOT ROCK. BEHIND THE QUARTERS – NIGHT

The storm continues. OLD holds two SHOVELS. He throws one at YOUNG.
 
46.


OLD
DIG.

OLD starts digging like a madman in the wind and rain.

OLD (CONT’D)
DIG, SAYS I!

YOUNG joins, afraid of what they might be digging up.


-LATER

THEY have dug a deep, muddy hole. About the size of a GRAVE.

OLD
HERE SHE LIES.

OLD unearths...

A WOODEN CRATE.

He gives it to YOUNG.


-MOMENTS LATER

They open it...

INSIDE ARE TEN FULL BOTTLES OF BOOZE.

YOUNG
(to himself, ironic)

Rations.


INT. LIVING QUARTERS. GALLEY - NIGHT

THE TWO DRINK while they ration out supplies. OLD is marshalling YOUNG. They are pretty drunk already.

A LEDGER is written in the LOGBOOK, marked with pounds of coal, number of tins, gallons of oil, etc.

OUTSIDE, THE RAIN HAMMERS DOWN. WIND HOWLS.

OLD
...their gums grew swollen, the color of bone, then to rot. Tarry blood oozed, teeth droppin’ to deck with none to hold on to. Their legs withered and turned gangrenous, every shade of the peacock’s tail.
(MORE)
 
47.

OLD (CONT'D)
The worst of us couldn’t fend
‘gainst the ship rats what gnawed

at the soles of our feet.

“Land ho!” I hears, but only grass and trees on that island. So we drunk upon the sap, and et upon the grass. ‘Twas providence saved us from turning to each other’s flesh, like barenaked savages. And ‘twas that scurvy what left me locked ever since.

He knocks on his leg again.

Pause.

YOUNG
Thought you said you broke it.

OLD
Eh?

YOUNG
Your leg. Catholic nuns, and such

like.

OLD
...No, ye must’a misheard.


INT. LIVING QUARTERS. BUNKROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

OLD sits on Young’s bed, staring out the window, fixated on the horrible STORM which is tearing the outbuildings apart. He holds A MOSTLY EMPTY BOTTLE.

OLD
Fallin’. Fallin’.

YOUNG is on the floor, pouring himself another. TWO EMPTY BOTTLES are by him.

YOUNG
No, no, no. No! And I says get off me, I says. But they never listened... they’d never... if I had the chance, they’d never –-none of them Goddamned lily-livered Canadian bastards. Lack-gall cowards. Those bastard didn’t fight no revolution -– never –- and look at em! Cowards and he-women all of ‘em. Goddamn ‘em!
 
48.


OLD keeps staring out the window.

OLD
The eaves be fallin’ fast.

YOUNG
Never! Any day, breaking my back,
working a man harder than two
horses, but Winslow, Winslow.., I

told that dumb bastard...

OLD
Yep. Them eaves is gonners.

YOUNG
Give me yer cant hook, I says to
him, but Winslow that goddamned
Canady fool bastard... always

callin’ me a dog. A filthy dog.

OLD turns.

OLD
Winslow?

YOUNG
Yeah, that bastard. “I’ll show you who’s a dog.”

OLD
Winslow?

YOUNG
What of him?

OLD
Who, Winslow? The eaves be fallin’--

YOUNG
He’s always raggin’ on me, like

you. Damn fool nonsense.

Pause.

How’d you find yourself off that
grass island anyhow?

OLD
Raggin’? Who’s raggin’? What
island? That’s the trouble with

you, Winslow.
 
49.


YOUNG
Yeah, that’s the trouble with

Winslow.

OLD
That’s the trouble with ye!

Pause.

YOUNG takes a swig and looks OLD in the eye.

YOUNG
The trouble with you is eating

grass without no teeth.

OLD
Come now?

YOUNG
Your teeth was fallen out--

OLD
What’re ye getting at, Winslow?

YOUNG
Just... just, it seems powerful hard to eat grass without no teeth. Goats and sheeps and cows. Well now, they all got teeth, don’t they?

OLD
Ye know how ye eat grass without

haven’ yer teeth?

YOUNG
Oblige me.

OLD
Ye rip it out and ye swallow it.

YOUNG
You rip it out and you swallow it.

OLD
Ye rip it out and--

YOUNG
I don’t know ‘bout that.

OLD
You don’t?
 
50.


YOUNG
I don’t.

OLD
What?

Pause.

YOUNG
What?

Pause.

OLD
What?

YOUNG
What?

OLD
(quickly, on his heels)

What?

YOUNG
(faster)

What?

OLD
(even faster)

What?

YOUNG
That’s what I mean.

OLD
what?

YOUNG
That’s the trouble with you.

OLD
That’s the trouble with you!

YOUNG
With you!!

OLD
With YOU!!!

YOUNG
NO!!!!

Pause.

(MORE)
 
51.

YOUNG (CONT'D)
(Suddenly)

I want a steak! I want a goddamned STEAK!!!!

OLD
Shut it.

YOUNG
A steak! A steak! A rare, bloody
steak. If I had a steak, I could,

oh boy, I could fuck it.

OLD
You don’t like my cookin’?

YOUNG
Don’t be such an old bitch.

OLD
You’re drunk, you don’t know what

yer talkin’--

YOUNG
How could I possibly like the

horseshit you fix us for supper?

OLD
Yer drunk, or ye wouldn’t be saying that!

YOUNG
I’m drunk? I’m drunk?

OLD
Ye heard me.

YOUNG
You’ve been drunk since...

OLD
Damn ye.

YOUNG
Drunk since I first laid eyes on

you.

OLD
Yer fond of me lobster, ain’t ye?

YOUNG
Yer drunker than a Virginy fence.

OLD
I seen it, yer fond of me lobster.
 
52.


YOUNG
--

OLD
Say it.

YOUNG
--

OLD
Say it.

YOUNG
--

OLD is furious.

OLD
Damn ye!

YOUNG
I don’t have to say nothi--

OLD
Let Neptune strike ye dead,

Winslow!

OLD becomes dreadfully serious.

YOUNG is afraid. Silent.

OLD speaks more powerfully and passionately than any Tamburlaine or Lear. He calls out to the gods of the sea -- a man possessed:

Hark, Triton, Hark!

Bellow, and bid our father, the sea king, rise up from the depths, full-foul in his fury, black waves teeming with salt-foam, to smother this young mouth with pungent slime...

(to Winslow)

to choke ye, engorging yer organs till ye turn blue and bloated with bilge and brine and can scream no more...

(MORE)
 
53.

OLD (CONT'D)
only when, he, crowned in cockle shells with slithering tentacled tail and steaming beard, takes up his fell, be-finnèd arm -– his coral-tined trident screeches banshee-like in the tempest and runs you through the gullet, bursting ye, a bulging bladder no more, but a blasted bloody film now

--	a nothing for the Harpies and the souls of dead sailors to peck and claw and feed upon, only to be lapped up and swallowed by the infinite waters of the dread emperor himself, forgotten to any man, to any time, forgotten to any god or devil, forgotten even to the sea... for any stuff or part of Winslow, even any scantling of your soul, is Winslow no more, but is now itself the sea.

OLD is shaking. Veins popping in every direction.
Exhausted... eyes drilling into YOUNG.

YOUNG sweats. What can he do? What can he say? Has he been cursed? Doomed?

YOUNG
Alright. Have it your way. I like

yer cooking.


EXT. PILOT ROCK - NIGHT

The cataclysmic storm continues.

Flash.

The wind.

Flash.

The rain.

Flash.

The waves.

Flash.

The foghorn.

Flash.
 
54.


INT. LIGHTHOUSE. MACHINE ROOM - NIGHT

CAMERA PUSHES IN ON: YOUNG watching the light through the grates. Hypnotized.

SMILING. SHAKING. INSANE?

WHISPERING ABOVE. Or is it just the spinning lens?

The sound is familiar and alien. Male and female. Celestial.

Hold.


INT. LIVING QUARTERS. BUNKROOM - DAY

YOUNG watches OLD, his chest and the LOGBOOK rise, and a loud SNORE follows.

YOUNG creeps forward toward OLD, trying not to make any noise. The sounds of THE STORM outside help to disguise some of his movements.

OLD keeps snoring.

He reaches his hand out, unfurling like a lure in slow-
motion, fishing for... the BRASS KEY around OLD’S neck....

The floorboards betray YOUNG with a loud GROAN.

YOUNG stops. Caught!

OLD opens one eye.

OLD
The sun is over the yardarm.
Best find me some winks afore the

day draws farther on.

OLD farts.

Pause.

YOUNG stands still.

OLD (CONT’D)
Get to yer duties or I’ll give you a real keelhauling.

Pause.

YOUNG stands still, defiantly.
 
55.


YOUNG
You you ain’t even human no more.
Workin’ apart from folks so long.

What’d you lose?

OLD
What’re ye doin’?

Pause.

YOUNG STANDS STILL.

OLD (CONT’D)
Get to work, says I!

YOUNG gives him a look that could kill.

OLD (CONT’D)
To work!

Pause.

OLD farts.


EXT. PILOT ROCK. PATHWAY - DAY

YOUNG wears his OILSKINS, pushing the wheelbarrow through the tempest. It’s almost impossible. Is he drunk or hungover? He mutters to himself.

He has a BOTTLE in the barrow, floating in rain water. That’s it. No coal.

YOUNG keeps his eye on the bottle. Watching it. Caring for it.


INT. FOG SIGNAL HOUSE - DAY

The fog machine whirls, pumps and... BELLOWS!

YOUNG shovels a heap of coal into the furnace. Shirt off.
OILSKIN HAT on.

He takes a swig from the bottle.

THE FIRE ROARS.


EXT. PILOT ROCK. SHORE – DAY

THE GALE IS MERCILESS AS EVER.
 
56.


YOUNG is pulling up THE ROPE OF A LOBSTER POT...

IMAGE: CLOSE ON: THE MERMAID’S SLIMY VAGINA.

YOUNG pulling the rope...

IMAGE: CLOSE ON: AN ERECT PENIS.

YOUNG pulling the rope...

IMAGE: THE LIGHTHOUSE, SAME ANGLE AS THE PENIS.

IMAGE: YOUNG’S HANDS TIGHTLY GRIP A CANT HOOK.

YOUNG pulling...

IMAGE: CLOSE ON: THE BACK OF A MAN’S HEAD. WOOL MACKINAW COLLAR.

QUICK CUT TO:


INT. SUPPLY SHED - DAY

YOUNG IS MASTURBATING IN THE DARK. FURIOUS. ANGRY. CONFUSED.

Shirt off. Oilskin hat on. Shivering. Rain pisses down through the holes in the roof.

He is holding the MERMAID CARVING. Staring at it. It’s not working.

He throws his head back, thinking of someone, something, isn’t he? He does it with a fury... lust...

It’s taking too long to get anywhere.

Back to the MERMAID CARVING...

Beat. Beat. Beat. Beat. Beat.

His hand is getting tired.

Beat. Beat. Beat. Beat. Beat.

He can feel something coming, it’s rising within him, he puts his other hand on the rickety wall... it’s coming... soon...

He’s lost it.

IMAGE: WIDE: YOUNG is straddling the MERMAID (the real one, not the carving), his pants half down, violently fucking her while she tries to drag him into the sea and slime.
 
57.


BACK TO THE SHED: YOUNG crumbles. Desire turns quickly into shame.

The fog horn calls. The wind howls. Rain pours into the shed.

HE THROWS THE MERMAID CARVING...

IT BREAKS IN TWO.

YOUNG looks at the broken MERMAID and curls into a ball on the wet ground with his pants around his hips...

He seems like he is about to cry...

But he laughs. He laughs as if a great weight has been lifted.

YOUNG
I fixed you. You bastard. You can’t get to me.

IMAGE: YOUNG is pulling the rope down by the rocks...

HE PULLS UP THE LOBSTER POT...

...INSIDE IS THE SHRIVELED HEAD OF A CORPSE with ONE EYE.

A SEAGULL SQUAWKS RIGHT BY HIS EAR (O.S.)!

YOUNG ALMOST FALLS IN THE WATER FROM TERROR.

SMALL CRABS CRAWL OUT OF THE EMPTY SOCKET.


INT. LIVING QUARTERS. GALLEY - NIGHT

THUNDER CLAPS.

OLD
(singing)

She swung her hips, she winked her eyes, that sassy little whore, So I took her in, I gave her gin,
and danced her on the floor

OLD AND YOUNG are singing, dancing, do-si-do-ing, swinging each other with linked elbows around the room in circles.

OLD AND YOUNG
(singing)

Doodle let me go, me girls, doodle let me go,

Hurrah, me yaller girls, doodle let me go
 
58.


OLD
(singing)
Oh 'round and 'round the sofa,
boys, wasn't it a show

She grabbed hold of my bobstay and she wouldn't let it go!

They laugh, and break away from each other...

OLD begins diddling “Ten Penny Bit” and dancing a jig. (Diddling is a kind of maritime scat-singing that mimics a fiddle)

YOUNG claps while OLD dances. His dancing is pretty impressive, especially with his bad leg.

YOUNG joins the diddling and jigging...

OLD begins clapping, too. He claps a little faster, YOUNG matches his tempo.

IT’S COMPETITIVE. FIERCE. MEAN.

They diddle, jig, and clap faster and faster and faster and faster...

OLD (CONT’D)
Dance! Dance, Winslow! Dance!

LIGHTNING FLASHES THROUGH THE WINDOW.


-LATER

OLD AND YOUNG are slow dancing. Arms around each others’ shoulders. Tired.

YOUNG looks at him with anger and suspicion.

OLD sings a ballad. His voice isn’t exactly pretty, or always on key, but the ballad is beautiful, with a haunting melody -- and his performance is moving. He’s deep into it, experiencing every moment.

OLD
(singing)
Oh, where have all the evenings
gone?
Oh, where is the ale and whisky
I’ve tasted?
Gone the same way as the pay I done wasted,

On a Monday morning.

(MORE)
 
59.

OLD (CONT'D)
If but the birds were gin,
If but the sun was a hearty
reveler,
If I might give someone else me
liver,
On a Monday morning.

My lover she lies asleep,
My lover is warm, and her heart is mellow,
I would give the whole world just

to share her pillow,

THE SONG has changed YOUNG’S mood, he has softened...

Timidly and quietly, he joins the last line...

OLD AND YOUNG
(half-singing)

On a Monday morning.

Thunder rumbles...

They lean into each other...

It is very tense...

It seems like they might kiss...

No, that’s madness.

Pause.

YOUNG pushes OLD away. He puts up his fists like an old-timey boxer.

OLD does, too.

They take turns hitting each other, play fighting. OLD keeps hitting YOUNG, as YOUNG is more drunk.

YOUNG
You bastard.

THE PLAY-FIGHTING ESCALATES... THE PUNCHES GROW HARDER...

THEN...

YOUNG grabs OLD and hurls him against the moldy cabinet! OLD cackles. THEY send the whole cabinet of cups and dishes clattering down.

OLD throws plates at YOUNG, almost hitting him... dinnerware smashing on the walls.
 
60.



They start throwing the scraps of fish bones and potato skins from their plates at each other... laughing.

They’re hysterically drunk. Demented.

YOUNG throws the soapbox... It breaks apart against the range!

They get closer to each other, running out of things to throw. Howling laughing...


-LATER

OLD pulls out another bottle and slams it down in front of YOUNG.

OLD
Drink.

YOUNG
Aye, aye, sir.

OLD
In one draft.

YOUNG
You do it.

OLD
YE DO AS I SAY! Goddamn yer calumny! The law says ye do as I command! I say drink, damn ye. Any word but “aye, sir” be mutiny!

Pause.

YOUNG
Aye, aye, sir!

YOUNG pulls the cork off. He drinks, and drinks, liquor pouring down the sides of his unshaven face.

OLD
Atta boy!!

-LATER

BOTH of them pour booze all over their faces.

THUNDER CLAPS. LIGHTING FLASHES THROUGH THE WINDOW.
 
61.


-LATER

YOUNG is so drunk, it’s hard to believe. He is soaked in liquor.

OLD has his head on YOUNG’S shoulder. He falls in and out of consciousness.

YOUNG
Thomas.

OLD
Aye?

YOUNG
It’s Thomas.

OLD
Aye.

YOUNG
No, I... I’m Thomas.

OLD
I’m Thomas. You’re Ephraim.

YOUNG
I lied.

OLD
I’m fearin’ I’m too old for this.

YOUNG
I’m Thomas. Tommy.

OLD
Tommy? (laughs) Tommy Winslow.

YOUNG
Tom Howard.

OLD
What’s Winslow?

YOUNG
Nothing.

OLD
Nothing?

YOUNG
It ain’t my fault... I...

Pause.
 
62.




No.

Pause.

Can I trust you?

OLD sits up.

Thunder rumbles.

OLD
Don’t be spilling any of yer beans to me.

YOUNG
No...

It wasn’t that way, is all...

OLD
I ain’t interested.

YOUNG
So I can trust you?

OLD
Never did like being confided to.

YOUNG
I know what you’re fixin’ to do.

Get me all liquored up--

OLD
Yer guilty conscience is ever as
tiresome-borin’ as any a guilty

conscience.

YOUNG
It was a drive, see...

OLD
Worse.

YOUNG
A log drive and... he’s raggin’ on me.

No –– I see what yer doing...

OLD
Nothing.
 
63.


YOUNG
Look, I mean, look, Tom... don’t be working to twist words out of my head.

OLD
I ain’t.

YOUNG
I...

look...

I can’t, I can’t.

OLD
Shut up yer rag box.

YOUNG
I can trust you.

OLD
No.

YOUNG
I trust you, Tom.

OLD
You trust me?

YOUNG
No. I don’t trust you at all.

They laugh. They drink.


INT. LIVING QUARTERS. BUNK ROOM - LATER, THAT SAME NIGHT

The CLOCK ticks monotonously. Somehow, the sounds of the storm have diminished.

CLOSE ON: YOUNG looking feral-eyed. Utterly still.


YOUNG
And I had ‘im in my grasp. Alone. Too far downstream. And I wanted to do ‘im in. I admit I did. Seein’ the back of his head. One swipe of the cant hook’d be all. It was... I didn’t... but I didn’t... I did not. The day was long as hell on that drive. I was lead-tired. I admit it.

(MORE)
 
64.

YOUNG (CONT'D)
But I saw him slippin’, not me. And we saw the jam comin’. And I stood and he slipped. He shouted up. And I just stood. “Tom, you dog!” And I stood, is all. Just stood and watched ‘im get swallowed down by them logs. I packed up his kit and fixings, as if they was mine. And, well, Ephraim Winslow has a spiffy clean slate. Thomas Howard, he don’t. No prospects. How else am I gonna find respectable work?

Pause.

YOUNG turns. OLD is gone... Did he even hear this?

YOUNG (CONT’D)
Tom?

Long pause.

YOUNG (CONT’D)
Tom?!

OLD (O.S.)
(far away, whispered,
echoing)

Why’d ye spill yer beans, Tommy.


INT. LIGHTHOUSE. TOWER STAIRS - MOMENTS LATER

OLD’S voice echoes. The chains clink, echoing too...

OLD (O.S.)
(whispered)

Why’d ye spill yer beans?

He ascends the stairs...


INT. LIGHTHOUSE. MACHINE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

THE DOOR to the GALLERY is open...

Rain blows wildly into the machine room.

YOUNG goes through the door...


EXT. LIGHTHOUSE. GALLERY – NIGHT

THE WIND AND RAIN ARE VICIOUS ON THE WALKWAY ATOP THE TOWER.
 
65.


They push and slap YOUNG as he carefully makes his way to...

A BODY.

It’s face down. Is it the OLD man?

NO. But it’s familiar - the MACKINAW COAT...

THE HIGH LEATHER BOOTS WITH THICK HOBNAILED SOLES...

For some reason, known least to YOUNG, he reaches out for the familiar man and turns the wet body over:

IT'S YOUNG! HIS DOPPELGANGER. PALE. DEAD.

AUDIO: WALK-DRAG. WALK-DRAG. WALK-DRAG.

THE HULKING FOOTSTEPS ARE LOUD. VIOLENT. RIGHT BEHIND YOUNG!

SOMEONE GRABS HIS WRIST FROM BEHIND. A BRUTAL GRIP.
SPINS YOUNG AROUND... IT'S OLD. NAKED.

HE HAS YOUNG WITHIN HIS POWER. HIS WILL. BUT... THE OLD MAN'S EYES ARE CLOSED.

YOUNG tries to get away. But he can't. The OLD man is too strong. And something starts to happen. Something horrible...

THE OLD MAN SLOWLY OPENS HIS EYES.

YOUNG's expression tells it all: fascination moves quickly through confusion and deep, unknown terror as ...

A LIGHT BRIGHTER THAN ANYTHING BATHES YOUNG'S FACE!

OLD’S EYES SHINE LIKE THE LIGHTHOUSE BEACON INTO YOUNG’S FACE.


EXT. PILOT ROCK – DAWN

CLOSE ON: YOUNG RUNS THROUGH THE STORM!


INT/EXT. BOATHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

YOUNG tries with utter desperation to launch the DORY out to sea. He throws on a CORK LIFE VEST.

HUGE WAVES CRASH AGAINST HIM.

It is a bitter struggle as he drags the DORY along the runners...
 
66.


YOUNG throws the OARS in the boat, and jumps inside.

Suddenly...

OLD
DON’T LEAVE ME!

OLD swipes through the air with a FIRE AXE, smashing the DORY right by YOUNG.

OLD keeps hacking away at the DORY...

YOUNG jumps out...

OLD hacks and smashes until the boat is just a pile of splinters rolling out into the sea...

YOUNG stands in shock.

THEN OLD turns to YOUNG...

OLD LIFTS THE AXE...

YOUNG RUNS...


EXT. PILOT ROCK - CONTINUOUS

OLD chases YOUNG across the island, wielding the axe...

YOUNG runs into the QUARTERS.


INT. LIVING QUARTERS. GALLEY – CONTINUOUS

OLD bursts in and swings the AXE at YOUNG, missing...

OLD buries THE AXE deep in the kitchen table. He falls with exhaustion. They are both soaking wet.

YOUNG
You crazy son of a bitch! You

smashed up the life boat!

OLD
Yer abandoning yer post!

YOUNG
What’re you gonna do? Send for the coast guard? The lighthouse establishment?
 
67.


OLD
Certain, says I! I’ll report ye,

I’ll bring the inspector up--

YOUNG
I’ll report you. I know what you

done...

OLD
Who’s reportin’ who?

Ephraim Winslow?

Or Thomas Howard?

I know what you done--

YOUNG
(suddenly)

You killed yer second.

OLD
--

For once, OLD is speechless. In horror.

YOUNG
I found him. Yer one-eyed junior

man.

In the lobster pot.

He went mad? You made him mad with that charm! That scrimshaw ditty, it’s a sea spell to keep him from yer secret... But I broke it, see. I’m free.

YOUNG rummages awkwardly through his pockets and finds the broken pieces of the IVORY MERMAID. He throws it to OLD’S feet! Young smiles in triumph.

YOUNG (CONT’D)
Free from yer designs!

OLD makes no expression.

YOUNG (CONT’D)
And I have it all figured out,
‘cept what’s the secret mischief

yer keeping...

He points to THE LANTERN ROOM.
 
68.



...up there!

OLD
--

YOUNG
I figured you old timer. This whole time, I’ve been watching you and I’ve got you figured.

OLD looks at YOUNG with pity.

OLD
Jesus, Mary and Joseph, Tommy.

Last night you made a confession ‘twould make a saint swear. I don’t have nothing to confess, but you, Tommy, a-spilling yer beans... now look what it’s done to ye.

It’s made ye mad.

I knew ye was mad when you smashed up the life boat just now, a-chasing me with an axe, tryin’ to kill ‘Ol Tom.

Don’t ye trust me, Tommy?

YOUNG
--

OLD
Look at yer shiverin’. Yer so mad, you know not up from down. How long have we been on this rock? Five week? Two days? Where are we? Help me recollect, who are you again, Tommy?

YOUNG
--

OLD
I’m probably a fig’ment of your
‘magination. This rock is a
fig’ment of yer ‘magination, too.

(MORE)
 
69.

OLD (CONT'D)
Yer probably wand’rin’ through a grove of tag alders, up in north Canady, like a frostbitten maniac a-talking to yerself, knee-deep in the snow, the blizzard overtaking ye.

Pause.

YOUNG
We’re out of drink.


INT. LIGHTHOUSE. OIL ROOM - LATER

HONEY DRIPS into a BRASS KEROSENE CANISTER.

YOUNG still wears the cork vest as he drips the HONEY.

OLD watches with intense curiosity.

YOUNG TAKES OUT A TIN OF TURPENTINE. He pours it into the CANISTER, too. He begins to stir it with a stick.

YOUNG
Thieves’ oil.

YOUNG smells it. He likes it.

He pours OLD a cup.

OLD drinks.

OLD
Oooooh, monkey pump!

They both drink... fighting over it.


INT. FOG SIGNAL HOUSE. NIGHT

ANGLE ON: THE BAROMETER. The needle is falling. It falls from “storm” to a blank space below. Off the chart, so to speak.

EXT. THE SEA - NIGHT

WIDE: GIGANTIC WAVES CRASH. THUNDER. LIGHTNING. THE END IS NEAR.


EXT. LIGHTHOUSE - NIGHT

WIDE: THE LIGHTHOUSE IS ASSAILED BY FEROCIOUS, 50-FOOT WAVES.
 
70.


ANGLE ON: THE LIVING QUARTERS, WATER RUSHING OVER THE ROOF. Will it survive?


INT. LIVING QUARTERS. GALLEY - NIGHT

OLD AND YOUNG laugh and laugh and laugh, holding cups of thieves’ oil. YOUNG still wears the life vest.

THE AXE in the table top between them.

They keep laughing in a frighteningly hysterical manner...

Laughing...

Laughing...

Laughing...

Laughing...

Laughing...

Laughing...

Laughing...

Laughing...

Laughing...

Laughing...

Laughing...

HOLD.

BLACK.


INT. LIVING QUARTERS. GALLEY - MORNING

THE GALLEY is an absolute catastrophe. However terrible it looked the night before, it is even worse now. It’s utterly destroyed. Mess is everywhere. THE AXE still stays buried in the table.

YOUNG is sitting in the SINK, drinking TURPENTINE straight from the tin. He’s still in the life vest.

YOUNG
This place is a sty.
 
71.


OLD (O.S.)
Mornin’ to you, too.

YOUNG
I wish I could go fer a walk.

OLD (O.S.)
Be my guest. You’ll get drowned.


INT. LIVING QUARTERS. BUNKROOM - LATER

The CLOCK ticks monotonously.

YOUNG is pissing, missing the chamber pot... taking off the life vest...

Suddenly, he begin to retch... he throws up.

He falls to his knees and sees...

OLD’S LOGBOOK... OPEN.

YOUNG fumbles around to snatch it up, to bring it to the dim window light.

He begins to leaf through the pages...

There are beautiful mementos of Old’s past, newspaper clippings, tintypes...

YOUNG finds locks of Old’s children’s hair... he touches them gently...

Then...

HE FINDS THE LOG ENTRIES:


Assistant slept late. Work below
standard. Attitude hostile.

YOUNG almost slams it shut. But he doesn’t. He keeps reading:

Assistant will not adhere to
hygiene regulations. Quarters a

mess. Flagrant insubordination.

Assistant missing again. Given to
habitual ‘self-abuse’ in the

storage shed.

YOUNG’S face drops. The CLOCK’S ticking seems to grow louder every second.
 
72.



Drunk on duty.

Erratic and incoherent speech.

Attempted to abandon his post.
Violently assaulted the head

keeper.

Recommend severance without pay to the inspector.

YOUNG looks like a ghost.

HE SMASHES THE CLOCK WITH HIS FIST. No more ticking.

Glass and blood.


INT. LIVING QUARTERS. GALLEY - MOMENTS LATER

OLD sits within a heap of trash. He’s wearing only his sweaty, baggy, mostly unbuttoned union suit. And his hat.

He smokes his PIPE...

It goes out.

OLD
Damn.

He tries to find a match in the chaos.

OLD (CONT’D)
(to himself)
Fiery pit! Ain’t there no justice

left in this world?

He roots through the rubbish, throwing it around...

Suddenly, the sound of a MATCH striking(O.S.)!

OLD turns around, startled.

YOUNG is right behind OLD... with a LIT MATCH... utterly still. Eerily still.

He calmly lights OLD’S PIPE.

OLD feels a bit uneasy.

OLD (CONT’D)
Thankee.
 
73.


Pause.

OLD (CONT’D)
What’s wrong with yer hand?

YOUNG looks at the match hand in confusion.

OLD (CONT’D)
T’other one.

YOUNG looks: his left hand leaves blood marks on the table.

He slithers his cut hand away.

OLD (CONT’D)
Ye hear o’ tetanus?

YOUNG
--

OLD
Tet-a-nus?

YOUNG
(quietly, rigid)

Yep.

OLD
It started as a sliver of a cut is all...

YOUNG is motionless. Boiling.

YOUNG
I said I heard of it.

OLD
...from the forestaysail when we

shoved off...

YOUNG
Can’t you never shut up.

OLD
...but come a fortnight...

YOUNG
Stop.

OLD
The bosun was a-shakin’...

YOUNG
Shut up, I says.
 
74.


OLD
....his chops was locked tighter

than an anchor bend--

YOUNG explodes:

YOUNG
Shut it! I told you I can’t hear no more! Hold yer jaw!

OLD
What were it yer accused me of?

YOUNG
I’m tired out of listening to your damned-fool yarns and your Cap’n Ahab horseshit -- you sound like a goddamned parody. Givin’ and nagging orders like a spinster schoolmarm... and... and... all-the-while turning this light in the Devil’s own rum hole.

Well, it’s all horseshit, all of it, yer leg, and yer sea life, all of it. And I’m tired of it. If I hear one more word of horseshit coming from your foul, rotten tooth, smelly old mouth––

OLD
Ye--

YOUNG
Shut up yer gum, Goddamn it -- I ain’t finished. I’m sick of lookin’ at you, I’m sick of lookin’ at week-old food in yer beard staring at me in the face like it ‘spects me of somethin’. I’m sick of yer orders. I’m sick of your laughing, your snoring, and your goddamned farts. Your damned goddamned farts. Goddamn yer farts! You smell like piss, you smell like jism, like rotten dick, like curdled foreskin, like hot onions fucked a farmyard shit-house. And I’m sick of yer smell. I’m sick of it! I’m sick of it, you goddamned drunk. You goddamned, no-account, drunken, son-of-a-bitch-bastard-liar!

(MORE)
 
75.

YOUNG (CONT'D)
That’s what you are, you’re a
goddamned drunken horse-shitting,

shit liar. A liar!

Long pause.

OLD
Ye have a way with words, Tommy.

YOUNG
Damn you.

OLD
Yer relived of yer duties.

YOUNG
Severance without pay?!

YOUNG throws THE LOGBOOK at him.

YOUNG (CONT’D)
Yer trying to ruin me?! I’m a hard worker! I am! I work as hard as any man!

OLD
Ye lie Thomas.

YOUNG
Stop it.

OLD
Ye lie to yerself, but ye ain’t

have the sauce to see it.

YOUNG changes his tune:

YOUNG
Work as hard as a man and two horses, I work like yer damn slave, you said so yerself.

YOUNG works at getting into the OIL ROOM from the GALLEY. OLD stands in his way.

YOUNG begs, desperately:

YOUNG (CONT’D)
Let me into the light, old man, and I’ll show you what I can do for -- I can -- I can do better -- I can. I’ve learned so much from you. Another chance. Let me show you.
(MORE)
 
76.

YOUNG (CONT’D)
Forgive and forget, I says -- just let me into that lantern, is all --

OLD keeps his ground.

OLD
Stand down.

YOUNG
Selfish bastard! Keepin’ it all to yerself. Left yer wife and children for what? For what?!

OLD smiles. Creepily.

OLD
Look at ye, handsome lad, with eyes bright as a lady. Come to this rock playin’ the tough, ye make me laugh with yer false grum. Ye pretended to some mystery in yer quietudes, but there ain’t no mystery, yer an open book. A picture, says I. A painted actress screaming in the footlights, a bitch what wants to be coveted for nothing but being born, cryin’ bout the silver spoon what should’ve been yers. Now look at ye crying.

YOUNG
--

OLD
Boo! Boo! What’re ye to do?

Look at ye. Look at ye.

Will you kill me? Will ye?

Will ye kill me like you done that gull?

YOUNG
I didn’t–-

OLD
LIAR! YE MURDERING DOG! TWAS YE

WHAT CHANGED THE WIND ON US!

YOUNG
Damn you!
 
77.


OLD
‘Twas you what damned us, dog! ‘TWAS YOU! Will ye do what ye wish ye done to ol’ Winslow? Take what’s left of me? Or do nothin’ like the coward y’are?

YOUNG
--

OLD
Will ye pick up that iron kettle and rack me face? Would ye best me then? If ye break, I win. If I break ye, I win.

YOUNG
--

OLD
I always win because you are less a man than I -- and them’s the rules of nature. Them’s truth.

I am truth. I make the truth as I see fit. Me. I make it as I demand it. The truth is that you’re a nothin’, Tommy-Tom-Tom. A nothing. A nothing but a dog what thinks he’s the master when he pulls on his master’s leash. Well if you pull on my leash, I’ll choke ye, Thomas Howard, I’ll strangle ye, fer Winslow were right: You’re A DOG, THOMAS, A FILTHY DOG! A DOG!!

OLD AND YOUNG ATTACK EACH OTHER AT THE SAME TIME -- GOING FOR EACH OTHERS’ THROATS! EYES BULGE.

OLD GRINS WILDLY...

YOUNG STARTS KICKING OLD IN HIS BAD LEG...

OLD CRUMBLES TO THE GROUND -- he tries to get up...

YOUNG KICKS OLD IN THE SPINE...

OLD’S FOREHEAD SMACKS AGAINST THE FLOOR. HARD. It bleeds.

YOUNG GETS ON TOP OF OLD AND TURNS HIM AROUND. OLD GRABS YOUNG’S SHOULDERS.

YOUNG
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
 
78.


THEY ARE VIOLENTLY WRESTLING... ANIMALISTIC GRUNTING...
BREATHING... SWEATING... LEGS ENTWINED... VEINY THROATS...

VEINY BICEPS...

MOVING BACK AND FORTH, BACK AND FORTH...

WRESTLING... BREATHING... GRUNTING... SWEATING...

SUDDENLY, YOUNG LOOKS DOWN... IT’S NO LONGER OLD...

IT’S EPHRAIM WINSLOW...

YOUNG IS IN TERROR...

WINSLOW SPITS IN YOUNG’S FACE...

YOUNG GOES TO STRANGLE HIM, BUT AS HE DOES... WINSLOW HAS BECOME...

THE MERMAID! SHE STRANGLES YOUNG... HER TAIL THRASHES...

HE TRIES TO GET AWAY...

THEN, THE MERMAID BECOMES...

OLD...

ONLY IT’S NOT: HE IS NAKED, HIS BEARD IS LONGER, COVERED IN SEAWEED... AND HE HAS ENORMOUS SQUID TENTACLES FOR LEGS...

YOUNG PUNCHES OLD, AND SEA WATER FLOWS FROM HIS MOUTH...

OLD LAUGHS... TWISTING HIS TENTACLES AROUND YOUNG... WRAPPING AROUND HIS ARMS AND LEGS, SQUEEZING...

YOUNG PUNCHES OLD AGAIN, BRUTALLY!

A TENTACLE WRAPS AROUND YOUNG’S THROAT, SQUEEZING...

YOUNG PUNCHES AGAIN!

TENTACLES SQUEEZING...

YOUNG PUNCHES AGAIN! AGAIN!!

OLD YELLS IN HORROR:

OLD
YER KILLING ME!

Suddenly...

YOUNG looks down.
 
79.


It’s OLD. Bloody. Whimpering.

No merperson, no Winslow, just an old, weeping man that YOUNG has beat to a pulp.

YOUNG stands, breathing heavily. He pulls up his suspenders. He wipes the sweat from his brow. OLD lies motionless, just breathing and letting out his almost inaudible whimper.

YOUNG leans on the table.

Very, very long pause.

YOUNG
Bark.

Pause.

Bark boy, bark, laddy.

Pause.

Bark!

OLD
(very, very weak)

Woof.

YOUNG
Ain’t you never been to sea before, bark I says, bark!

OLD
Arf.

YOUNG
Bark, laddy!

OLD
Ruff! Ruff!!

YOUNG
Now, there’s a good boy. There’s a good dog.

Long pause.


Now roll over.


EXT. PILOT ROCK. NEAR THE HOLE – AFTERNOON

The storm has ended.
 
80.


YOUNG walks OLD on a leash, well, a belt around his neck. OLD crawls on all fours.

YOUNG
Good boy.

YOUNG walks OLD to the GRAVE-SIZED HOLE they dug out.

YOUNG (CONT’D)
Get in there, you old dog. Where

you belong.

Pause.

YOUNG (CONT’D)
You do as I say, dog!

OLD slinks into the grave.

YOUNG (CONT’D)
That’s my good lad.

YOUNG picks up a shovel...

He begins to bury OLD.

OLD
No!

YOUNG puts more dirt and mud on him...

OLD (CONT’D)
You wish to see what’s in that

lantern?

So did me last assistant.

YOUNG shovels mud onto OLD’S face...

YOUNG
Shut up, dog. Polish yer brasswork.

He keeps shoveling...

OLD laughs, blood pouring out of his mouth. Dying.

OLD
You said yer a God fearin’ man,
Tommy? (laughs) Them’s truth,

Tommy!

More dirt on him...

(MORE)
 
81.

OLD (CONT'D)
O what Protean forms swim up from
men’s minds and melt in hot
Promethean plunder scorching eyes

with divine shames and horrors

More dirt on him...

and cast them down to Davy Jones. And others, still blind, yet in it see all divine graces and to Fiddler’s Green sent, where no man is suffered to want and toil, but is

More dirt on his face...

ancient

More dirt on his face...

mutable

More dirt on his face...

and unchanging as the she who
girdles ‘round the globe.

More dirt...
Them’s truth. And you’ll be

punished.

OLD becomes stifled from the dirt and mud.

Long pause.

Is he dead?

Suddenly, YOUNG panics...

He jumps into the grave and starts digging out OLD with his hands...

Digging and digging...

He lifts OLD up. He holds him.

Pause. YOUNG catches his breath.

YOUNG takes the BRASS KEY that hangs from around OLD’S neck...

He let’s OLD fall into the mud, still as a stone.

YOUNG walks away.
 
82.


YOUNG doesn’t see it, but several GULLS fly into frame behind him.


INT. LIGHTHOUSE. OIL ROOM – NIGHT

YOUNG slowly approaches the long staircase.

He looks up...

He puts his hands on the railing...

He is ready to go into the lantern room at last.

But something stops him...

No, he can’t go on.

He pats his breast pocket...


INT. LIVING QUARTERS. GALLEY – MOMENTS LATER

YOUNG walks through the galley. He goes to the table...

THERE IT IS: HIS POUCH OF TOBACCO.

He begins to roll a cigarette...

He looks down:

Staring at him is A HOLE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TABLE -- BUT THE AXE IS GONE...

OLD (O.S.)
THE LIGHT B’LONGS TO ME!

OLD, covered in dirt, barely alive, swings THE AXE, cutting into YOUNG’S shoulder. Blood gushes from the wound.

YOUNG picks up the IRON KETTLE and swings around, bashing OLD in THE FACE.

OLD falls hard to the ground, groaning...

YOUNG PICKS UP THE AXE...

HE LIFTS IT HIGH...

OLD tries to guard himself with his hands...

YOUNG DRIVES THE AXE INTO OLD’S HEAD WITH A BLOOD CURDLING CRUNCH! (OLDS’S head is O.S.
 
83.


But it is clear that this is what happened). BLOOD SPLATTERS ACROSS THE ROOM. His old limbs seize for a moment and drop back to the floor.

Pause.

YOUNG limps, covered in blood, back to the table.

He rolls the cigarette, his hands shaking.

He smokes it.

He pours some turpentine into a nearby cup.

He looks at OLD, the axe handle sticking up from his head.

YOUNG lifts the cup. Hand shaking. He toasts.

YOUNG
Should pale death with treble dread make the ocean caves our bed, God who hear'st the surges roll,
deign to save the suppliant soul.

He drinks.

Hold.


INT. LIGHTHOUSE. OIL ROOM – NIGHT

Limping, trembling, and bleeding, YOUNG slowly ascends the long staircase...


INT. LIGHTHOUSE. TOWER STAIRS – MOMENTS LATER

YOUNG continues, slowly...


INT. LIGHTHOUSE. MACHINE ROOM – MOMENTS LATER

YOUNG ascends the ladder, slowly, and using THE KEY, HE OPENS THE HATCH that leads into the LANTERN ROOM...

The dazzling LIGHT swirling...

YOUNG is hypnotized...


INT. LIGHTHOUSE. LANTERN ROOM - NIGHT

YOUNG looks ahead...
 
84.


There it is: THE FRESNEL LENS. It is a massive, six-foot-tall jewel of indescribable beauty. It seems to sing...

He walks toward it...

Pause.

He marvels at it.

Slowly, he opens the door of the lens...

The light grows brighter...

Pause.

He takes it in.

Pause.

A tear falls from his eye.

He smiles.

Slowly, he puts his hand into the light...

A deep, bassy, fire-crackling sound is heard as he touches the flames...

THE LIGHT grows brighter...

His hand is burning, but he keeps reaching...

The crackling sound growing louder and more otherworldly...

YOUNG starts to shake with insanity...

His face distorts...

THE LIGHT GROWS BRIGHTER...

YOUNG SCREAMS...

BRIGHTER...

INCONCEIVABLY BRIGHT...

YOUNG starts trembling, crying, he’s terrified of what he has seen...

He cannot fathom it...

He foams at the mouth....

He teeters...
 
85.


He’s loosing his balance... he’s falling...

He falls backward out of frame...

OUT OF THE LANTERN ROOM...

SLAM.

INTO THE MACHINE ROOM...

BANG.

AND DOWN THE STAIRS...

...All the way down the long winding staircase, tumbling, tumbling, grunting, twisting, bones breaking, and clanging down four stories of stairs until YOUNG lands with a dull, bloody...

THUD.

FADE TO WHITE.


EXT. PILOT ROCK – DAWN

YOUNG lies naked, splayed out on the rocks, bones broken.

He is blind. His eyes are bloody, burnt-out sockets. He can’t move. Seaweed is wrapped around him.

A seabird pecks at his abdomen...

Peck. Peck. Peck.

It is THE ONE-EYED GULL...

It pulls at YOUNG’S liver...

YOUNG groans...

Dozens and dozens of BIRDS fly to YOUNG, overwhelming him.

Eating him.

CAMERA pulls back to reveal him alone, on PILOT ROCK. (CAMERA doesn’t pull back far enough to see the lighthouse or outbuildings.)

Only YOUNG and a swarm of seabirds eating him.

HOLD.

THE END.
