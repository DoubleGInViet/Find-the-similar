FADE IN:
INT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT
Mostly shadows illuminated by a lantern's flame. But we can make out the dusty floor...  the bucket of water with a rag hanging over the edge.
We drift across the room...  to a bed...  an ANSTADT RIFLE standing beside it, a FRESH STAR fully carved in its stock.
As we move up past the rifle, we begin to hear O.S. WHISPERS...  we keep rising...  to the SHAPE OF A YOUNG BOY shivering violently under blankets... 
... and MAN'S HANDS stroking the boy's sweat-soaked hair...  trying to comfort him. Then the shadowy face of HUGH GLASS leans into the frame...  presses against the little boy's ear.
GLASS
(whispering)
Not yet...  not yet...  not yet.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. UPPER MISSOURI RIVER/1820'S - EVENING
As we FLOAT WITH A LEAF DOWN THE CURRENT...  past a FLATBOAT BEACHED ON A SANDBAR...  as DISTANT VOICES seem to rise around us... 
... because beyond the flatboat are TWENTY-FIVE MEN of the Rocky Mountain Fur Company, making camp along the shore...  some pitching squares of canvas for makeshift rooftops...  others stacking HUNDREDS OF BEAVER PELTS and ANIMAL FURS for hauling...  a few Men laughing and singing...  a circle of others form a ring around a couple of WRESTLING TRAPPERS, calling out their bets as the Trappers grapple... 
... while nearby, several MEN have formed a MAKESHIFT BAND, scratching out a song with fiddles, washboards and harmonicas, as a few Trappers dance along, passing a bottle of whiskey among them.
This camp is full of life because these are some of the first men to ever see this untouched wilderness...  men with a whole new world just waiting for them to claim their share.
And one of the dancing Trappers is JOHN FITZGERALD, (30’s), solid and thick...  a WOLFSKIN CAP flopping on his head as he locks elbows with another TRAPPER, swinging him to the music.
2.
The song ends...  the Trappers CHEER...  Fitzgerald tosses that fur cap into the air with several others, revealing a STRIP OF OLD SCALPED SCAR running along one side of his head.
And as the caps float back to the earth like snowflakes, CAPTAIN ANDREW HENRY, (20's), appears beyond them...  dressed in a buckskin jacket with long fringe...  thick belt pulled tightly around his waist with two pistols and a knife hanging from it. He stands out among the others...  like an imposter pretending to be a member of some exclusive club.
HENRY
Fitzgerald, you and the rest help
with the fires.
The excitement fades from Fitzgerald's eyes...  replaced with resentment. He watches Henry walk away, then grabs his wolfskin cap from the dirt...  throws it over his scarred head, and rolls his eyes to MACE BOONE.
FITZGERALD
Yes sir, Captain.
EXT. CAMP - EVENING
Fitzgerald and Boone gather a few scraps of wood...  look over to Henry, pulling off one of his gloves to examine the BLOOD-FILLED BLISTERS lining his palm.
FITZGERALD
Likely got a splinter. Can’t figure what to do without Mama here to pull it out for him.
Boone chuckles...  spits in Henry’s direction.
BOONE
Need a doc, Captain?
Henry looks up...  sees Fitzgerald and Boone grinning at him.
HENRY
Gather more wood.
Fitzgerald waits for Henry to turn, then gives his back an exaggerated salute.
FITZGERALD
(under his breath)
Shame my Pap was a broken down drunk. Else he could’ve bought me a Captain’s job too.
3.
Boone snickers. Fitzgerald stomps his boot onto a branch, easily snaps it into two easy-to-carry pieces.
FITZGERALD (cont’d) We got a plan for these fires, Captain, or are we roastin’ berries all the way up to Fort Union?
HENRY
Glass and the others will be back with some game, Fitzgerald. Just make sure you have the fires ready.
FITZGERALD
My supper’s in the hands of a injun-lover, a peach-fuzz kid and a half-wit dummy. Hell, my belly feels full already.
Fitzgerald’s boot CRACKS another branch...  and when it does, we hear the EXPLOSION OF A GUNSHOT.
CUT TO:
EXT. WILDERNESS - EVENING
And a CLOUD OF SMOKE surrounding the LONG BARREL OF AN ANSTADT RIFLE.
The smoke fades, and at the other end of the rifle we see the worn face of HUGH GLASS, (38), one eye still closed, as the other calmly stares down that barrel.
VOICE (O.S.)
Shit fire, you got him, Mr. Glass!
Glass lowers the rifle, as JIM BRIDGER, (17), boyish face that looks even younger, races past with PIG GILMORE, (40’s), fat and filthy, shuffling right behind.
BRIDGER (CONT’D)
Got him square as a barn door.
Bridger and Pig trot through the trees to a fallen ELK. Glass walks after them, graceful in this world...  his rifle so comfortable in his hand it’s like he was born with it there.
BRIDGER (cont'd)
Gonna be a load to haul back to
camp.
PIG
Have to split it up I reckon.
4.
GLASS
Bridger and me’ll take the tail,
Pig you haul the rest.
And Fitzgerald was right about Pig being a little slow, because he just nods along...  pulls out his knife to cut the tail off for Bridger...  then stops...  catches himself...  looks up at them grinning back down.
PIG
That's clever, Hugh.
GLASS
Worth a try anyways.
But then Glass notices something...  his smile fades, as he steps over the elk, his eyes locked on the ground beside it. He runs a finger over the dirt...  touches a broken twig.
BRIDGER
'Nother close by?
Glass doesn’t answer...  studies the track...  feels the nearby brush...  inhales the scent from his hand. Bridger and Pig watch him...  exchange a confused glance.
And then in a flash of movement, Glass is racing away.
PIG
Hugh?
Glass just keeps running.	Pig and Bridger chase after him.
CUT TO:
EXT. CAMP - EVENING
The men building fires...  laughing...  enjoying themselves.
Boone on the outskirts, gathering branches.
CUT TO:
GLASS - TEARING THROUGH THE WOODS... 
... dodging trees...  leaping over fallen logs...  loading his Anstadt as he runs.
5.
BRIDGER AND PIG - CHASING AFTER GLASS... 
... but not as gracefully. Bridger trips...  slams to the ground...  scrambles back to his feet to continue on.
CUT TO:
BOONE - CARRYING AN ARM-LOAD OF WOOD INTO CAMP... 
... seeing other men playing cards. He stops along the edge of camp, drops the wood to the ground.
BOONE
No rule says I’m the only one
that’s gotta gather this shit.
The other men don’t even notice. Then an ARROW WHIZZES THROUGH THE AIR from behind Boone...  THWACK...  it hits him in the back of the neck...  erupts out the front of his throat.
Boone stands frozen...  confused...  reaches up and grabs the bloody arrow...  finally drops to his knees. And that’s when a TRAPPER looks up...  sees Boone on his knees, holding that arrow, his mouth open like a dying fish.
And beyond Boone are THIRTY ARIKARA WARRIORS CHARGING THROUGH THE TREES...  FEATHERS RISING FROM THE MOHAWKS SPLITTING THEIR SHAVED HEADS...  FACES PAINTED FOR BATTLE.
TRAPPER
‘REE!
WHOOSH...  AN ARROW SAILS INTO THE TRAPPER’S CHEST, sending him flying backward. The camp explodes into chaos...  men YELLING...  grabbing for weapons...  stumbling over each other as they duck behind trees.
HENRY - PULLING THE PISTOLS FROM HIS BELT... 
... taking nervous aim at the attacking figures.
The Arikara leader, (ELK’S TONGUE), animal bones braided into his mohawk, a NECKLACE OF HUMAN EARS around his neck, heads the attackers...  pouring into camp, arrows flying...  knives and hatchets swinging.
And this is a massacre...  the Arikara wading through the trappers...  stabbing...  clubbing...  scalping. This once peaceful world is filled with a sickening mix of war cries and screams of death.
6.
HORSES AND MULES break loose of their ties...  take off in all directins.
Fitzgerald rises up from behind a log...  aims his rifle...  BOOM...  takes down one of the warriors. He starts reloading as ANOTHER WARRIOR charges him...  draws back his knife. Fitzgerald pours the powder, but knows he isn’t going to make it in time. The Warrior leaps toward him... 
... BOOM...  and it’s like the Warrior hits an invisible wall...  flies back to the ground, very dead. Fitzgerald spins...  sees Glass and his Anstadt right behind him.
GLASS
GET TO THE BOAT!
Fitzgerald takes off...  but he's a skilled fighter...  flips his rifle around, swings it like a club across a WARRIOR'S head...  WHACK...  swings again...  TAKES OUT ANOTHER WARRIOR...  buries his knife into an ATTACKER's belly.
GLASS (cont’d)
THE BOAT, CAPTAIN!
Henry shoves a TRAPPER toward the water. An arrow drives into the Trapper’s leg...  he goes down. Henry lifts him, but several more arrows bury in the man’s back...  he falls dead.
Bridger and Pig join Glass...  splash into the river, SHOOTING back at the attacking Arikara.
A WARRIOR LEAPS FROM THE SHADOWS...  tackles Bridger to the shallows...  pins him underwater...  raises his hatchet high to slam down...  just as Glass dives into him, knocking the Warrior off Bridger. Glass and the Warrior wrestle in the surf, until Glass finally overpowers him...  stabs his knife deep into the Warrior’s stomach.
Bridger kneels in the shallows, frozen in shock.
GLASS (cont’d)
GO!
Pig drags Bridger to his feet...  they swim toward the boat.
ARROWS hiss into the water all around them.
Glass pulls his pistol...  BAM...  shoots an oncoming
WARRIOR...  spins after the others...  joins them as they near the flatboat.
A final TRAPPER charges down the shore after them. SEVERAL WARRIORS pursue him.
7.
TRAPPER
WAIT!
He aims his pistol over his shoulder as he runs...  pulls the trigger...  CLICK...  pulls it again...  CLICK. But he’s too scared to stop his finger...  CLICK...  CLICK...  CLICK... 
THUD...  as a hatchet buries in his back. He crashes face first into the shallows.
Elk's Tongue straddles the dying man...  grabs the Trapper by the hair, and CUTS OFF HIS LEFT EAR, then holds it up to Glass and the others, as he SCREAMS HIS WAR CRY.
Glass and the men shove the flatboat off the sandbar. Arrows dart past them...  drive into the wooden boat. They scramble aboard as the current carries them away.
Pig reaches over the side, pulls the frantic WILLIAM ANDERSON up onto the boat. Fitzgerald and Glass grab LONGPOLES...  shove them against the river’s bottom to pick up speed.
Henry stands on deck, watching as Elk’s Tongue yanks a DYING TRAPPER’s head back by his hair to peel away his scalp. Henry drops his eyes...  can’t watch. The TRAPPER’S SCREAM ECHOES OVER HIM.
EXT. MISSOURI RIVER/FLATBOAT - LATER
Quiet and dark...  the battle long over. The flatboat floats with the gentle current. The NINE SURVIVING TRAPPERS are scattered around the deck...  Glass digging an arrow out of MURPHY’s shoulder...  Fitzgerald poling on one side with Anderson on the other...  STUBBY BILL and Pig standing patrol with their rifles...  Bridger doctoring a badly WOUNDED TRAPPER...  and Henry standing at the front of the flatboat, staring off blankly.
FITZGERALD
What’s the plan, Captain?
Henry’s still lost in those screams.
FITZGERALD (cont’d)
Captain!	What the hell do we do
now?
Henry snaps out of his stare...  turns to the men...  obviously doesn’t have an answer.
ANDERSON
We’re just floatin’ farther from
Fort Union.
8.
Henry’s eyes instinctively look to Glass.
GLASS
The Missouri’s no good. Not if the ‘Ree’s running it.
FITZGERALD
So we just float the hell down to
Mexico or wherever else this
current takes us?
GLASS
We get safe outta range then track another course up on land.
FITZGERALD
Add weeks to the trip.
BRIDGER
Better that than endin’ up scalped on the side of the river.
FITZGERALD
Shut up, boy, you don’t get no say in this.
(back to Henry)
And in case you hadn’t noticed, Captain, we’re seventeen men short of what we were.
(off the wounded trapper)
Eighteen before long.
HENRY
I understand our situation, Mr.
Fitzgerald.	We do like Glass
said...  put some distance between
us and the Arikara, then chart a
course to Fort Union.
FITZGERALD
Like Glass says.	Shit, now we're
trustin' him to stay alive?
PIG
He’s the company scout.
FITZGERALD
Scouted us right into a pack a 'Ree. Maybe his years livin' with the Pawnee makes him forget what side he's on.
9.
PIG
Looked to be on your side when he
saved your hide back there.
Fitzgerald throws a deadly glare at Pig.
FITZGERALD
I didn't need savin' by Glass or nobody else. We clear on that, you simple sonofabitch?
Pig tries to hold Fitzgerald's glare...  can't...  looks back to the passing shores...  shoots a quick glance to Glass, who gives him a nod...  Thank you. And that's enough to make Pig smile...  proud of himself.
EXT. WILDERNESS - NIGHT
A small campfire glows in the night. A DOZEN FRENCH TRAPPERS are scattered around the camp, talking...  laughing... 
... enough that they don't notice the shadows silently approaching from the trees around them... 
... Elk's Tongue and several of his Arikara warriors.
Finally, one of the Trappers spots Elk's Tongue...  freezes in mid-sentence...  as the others turn to his stare.
But this is no attack...  this is a business transaction. Elk's Tongue tosses a STACK OF SCALPS at their feet...  the scalps we saw them take from Glass' company earlier.
TOUSSAINT, (40's), the leader of this bunch, forces a nervous smile...  throws a glance to his rifle, well out of reach.
TOUSSAINT
(all his dialogue is
spoken in French)
You had a good hunt.
(off the scalps)
These are all English...  Americans?
Elk's Tongue just stares back...  doesn't understand.
TOUSSAINT (cont'd)
No French here.
Toussaint taps his own chest...  points to the other trappers.
TOUSSAINT (cont'd)
No French. We don't pay for French.
10.
Elk's Tongue shakes his head...  says something in Arikara that Toussaint and the rest of us don't understand...  not until he holds out his hand.
TOUSSAINT (cont’d)
(to a TRAPPER)
Pay the savage.
(to Elk's Tongue)
You want to eat?	You want food?
Toussaint pantomimes eating.	Elk's Tongue shakes his head.
The Trapper digs out some coins...  blankets...  liquor... 
gives them to Elk's Tongue's Warriors.
TOUSSAINT (cont'd)
Only kill English and American.
This land is for you and us.	We
work together.
Elk's Tongue points to one of the Frenchmen's HORSES, tied in the trees.
TOUSSAINT (cont'd)
(shaking his head)
No horses.	We need them.
Elk's Tongue points again.
TOUSSAINT (cont'd)
I told you last time. They aren't part of the trade.
One of Elk's Tongue's Warriors moves to the horse...  begins stroking it...  checking its teeth...  like a new owner.
TOUSSAINT (cont'd)
Tell your man no horse.
But Elk's Tongue isn't telling his man anything.
TOUSSAINT (cont'd)
(to a Trapper)
Get him away.	I don't want that
animal's stink on my pony.
As the Trapper moves toward the Warrior... 
ELK'S TONGUE
(in broken French)
It's your smell that covers our
land.
11.
... and everyone freezes...  because Toussaint and his Men are shocked by Elk's Tongue's use of their language. And Elk's Tongue suddenly seems smarter...  more dangerous...  especially with the way he's looking at Toussaint right now.
ELK'S TONGUE (cont'd)
(still in French)
We take your horses.
And Toussaint's pretty smart too...  smart enough to see this deal has turned bad...  fast...  and that he and his Men don't stand a chance against Elk's Tongue's Warriors.
So Toussaint forces a thin smile...  motions his Trapper back.
TOUSSAINT
Business is business.
The French can only sit there and watch as Elk's Tongue's gang disappears into the night with their horses.
EXT. MISSOURI RIVER/FLATBOAT - NIGHT
ANGLE ON THE BADLY WOUNDED TRAPPER...  NOW DEAD... 
... as hands push the body over the side of the boat. It splashes into the water...  floats downstream.
We PULL BACK...  see that the flatboat is beached along the bank of the river. Glass, Bridger and Pig watch the body drift away.
PIG
Reckon it's better than lettin' the 'Ree find him...  take his ears.
Glass nods...  turns away.
BRIDGER
Thank you...  for what you done back there.
GLASS
You’d have done the same for me.
BRIDGER
(nods...  hopeful)
Yessir.
Glass, Bridger, and Pig approach the others, all gathered around Henry's map spread out on the ground.
12.
HENRY
Tryin' to set a course.
Glass runs his finger along a THIN BLUE LINE.
GLASS
Best course is to hike west to the
Grand, then follow it up to Fort
Union.
FITZGERALD
On foot? It’ll be winter before we get there.
ANDERSON
Unless we come across a post... 
trade for some horses.
GLASS
No posts that far over.
FITZGERALD
So if we do this, we do every step on our own feet.
Henry considers this a beat, then... 
HENRY
Then that’s what we’ll have to do.
More GRUMBLING from Fitzgerald and Anderson, as they start gathering what's left of the supplies for the journey.
EXT. WOODS - NIGHT
Shadowy figures moving through the trees...  not a word spoken. And then we see Glass leading the group...  eyes cutting into the dark...  searching for any danger.
Pig's off to one side of Glass...  Henry the other, with Fitzgerald leading the rest right behind. And they're all exhausted...  only the fear of what else might be hidden in these trees is keeping them awake.
EXT. WOODS/STREAM - LATER
Slivers of moonlight bleed through the canopy of trees...  shine over Anderson, Stubby Bill and Murphy, as they crouch beside the stream, filling their canteens.
Henry and Pig are studying that map. Bridger stands in the shadows, keeping watch.
13.
Glass sits at the base of a tree, cleaning his Anstadt rifle...  polishing down the TATTERED STAR CARVED INTO THE STOCK.
Fitzgerald takes a gulp from his FLASK...  watches Glass with mean, drunk, eyes.
FITZGERALD
You treat that Anstadt sweeter than any woman, Glass.
STUBBY BILL
That's 'cause there ain't no woman that can stop a ‘Ree from three hundred feet.
ANDERSON
I knew a particular big-breasted
redhead in Boston that might come
close.
The others manage a nervous laugh. Glass doesn't react...  just keeps working on the Anstadt. Fitzgerald walks to Glass...  reaches down, and grabs the barrel of the Anstadt.
FITZGERALD
Lemme see what's so special 'bout
that shooter a yours.
Glass holds firm.
GLASS
Workin’ on it.
FITZGERALD
Well you can stop workin' on it, and lemme have a look like I said.
Fitzgerald gives another tug, but Glass’ grip only grows tighter. His eyes roll up to Fitzgerald...  make it clear he isn’t giving up his rifle. And they hold that stare just as hard as they’re holding Glass’ gun.
FITZGERALD (cont’d)
You got hired into this outfit, so you work for us. Or did you forget your place?
GLASS
Best I can tell, my place is right where I want it...  on the smart end of this rifle.
14.
Fitzgerald realizes the barrel he’s holding is aimed his direction, while Glass’ hand seems suddenly very close to the trigger. But Fitzgerald’s pride won’t let him lose this tug of war. Which means this thing’s about to turn real ugly.
FITZGERALD
Any of you boys wonder how it is
them 'Ree got the drop on us...  when Glass here was supposed to be lookin' out for just that?
HENRY
That's enough, Fitzgerald. We need to keep movin'.
FITZGERALD
(to Glass)
Makes me think maybe you're gettin' a cut on all them scalps they sell to the Frenchies.
Fitzgerald uses his free hand to pull off that fur cap of his...  shows off his wide, hairless scar.
FITZGERALD (cont'd)
How much did you get for this? Or for my wife's?
And that flask of whiskey has just helped give us a glimpse into where some of Fitzgerald's rage comes from.
HENRY
Goddammit, Fitzgerald, I said
that’s enough.
Fitzgerald keeps his grip on the rifle another moment, then shoves the Anstadt barrel back at Glass.
FITZGERALD
To me you ain't no whiter than them 'Ree.
Fitzgerald spits to the ground a few feet away from Glass. Glass isn't biting...  goes back to his rifle. So Fitzgerald walks back to the others...  spots Bridger looking at him.
FITZGERALD (cont'd)
Whatta you starin' at, boy?
Bridger drops his eyes...  locks them on the ground until he's
sure Fitzgerald has lost interest.	Then he glances back
up...  sees Glass watching him...  just for a moment before he
goes back to the Anstadt.
15.
EXT. WOODS - LATER
The group pushing through the darkness...  dried leaves crunching under their boots.
Glass and Henry are out front. Henry throws a glance back to Fitzgerald, bringing up the rear with Anderson.
HENRY
Fitzgerald's just testing you.
Same with me since we left St.
Louis.	Not sure I've passed many
so far.	Especially today's.
(beat)
Maybe I should’ve had us make camp further up river.
GLASS
The tracks I saw...  those ‘Ree had been on us for a while. They’d have gone as far north as it took.
Henry nods...  hopes that’s true.
GLASS (cont’d)
You’re a good man, Captain.	Soon
as you realize that, these others
will too.
Henry likes hearing that...  still isn’t sure it’s true.
HENRY
It's a different world than Boston. But my father...  he thought this would be good for me.
Henry thinks about that a beat, then shakes away the memory.
HENRY (cont'd)
Where are you from originally?
GLASS
Pennsylvania.
HENRY
Long way from home.
A BEAT, then... 
GLASS
Stopped bein' a home for me a while back.
Henry can sense he shouldn't dig deeper.
HENRY
So you ended up out here with the
Pawnee?
GLASS
Not by choice. They grabbed me while I was trappin' the Arkansas. I figured it was to kill me, but turned out they were just curious. Nothin' savage about 'em. I ended up stayin' with 'em a year or so. Till the 'Ree took their land...  pushed 'em north.
HENRY
And you've just wandered alone since?
GLASS
Haven't found a place I belong.
Another quiet beat, then... 
HENRY
How much experience have you had with the Arikara?
GLASS
Enough to know to stay outta their way. And that once they've got your scent, they're not easy to shake loose.
HENRY
And our chances of makin' it up to Fort Union?
GLASS
A smart man would always put his chips on the 'Ree.
That's not the answer Henry wanted to hear.
the darkness ahead.
EXT. WILDERNESS - MORNING
The sun is just rising up over the horizon.
EXT. WILDERNESS - DAY
16.
He peers into
Thick with trees. Henry leads the men single file through the woods.
17.
STUBBY BILL
Shouldn’t we have hit the Grand by now?
HENRY
We’ll reach it soon enough. Glass said to keep this course.
FITZGERALD
It's always Glass said. So why is it I don’t see him ‘round nowheres then?
PIG
On account he’s up ahead makin’
sure it’s clear, and you get to
keep your ears.
Fitzgerald throws Pig an angry glance.
FITZGERALD
Or he’s run off...  left us to find our own way.
BRIDGER
Mr. Glass wouldn’t do that.
FITZGERALD
You ain't got no idea know what your savage-lovin' Mr. Glass might do. And that's the problem.
EXT. WOODS - DAY
Glass moves slowly through the brush, almost gliding...  subtle twists and turns to avoid branches and leaves...  careful not to leave his scent behind. And his eyes cut through the trees as he moves...  digging for any sign of movement.
He spots something at his feet...  crouches down, running his finger over the SMALL ANIMAL TRACK in the dirt.
O.S. RUSTLING snaps his head up...  to the TREMBLING OF BUSHES...  growing harder...  whatever’s in there is coming toward Glass. He calmly raises his rifle...  presses the stock firmly against his shoulder...  closes one eye as he takes steady aim down the long barrel... 
... to the shapes rumbling out of the brush...  TWO BEAR CUBS playfully wrestling.
18.
Glass lowers the Anstadt...  looks past the cubs for something else...  but the woods are empty. A SUDDEN FEAR FILLS GLASS’ EYES... 
... he spins...  right into the GIANT GRIZZLY SWINGING ITS PAW AT HIM...  hitting him across the side of the neck. The animal’s razor claws tear into Glass’ throat, as the force sends him flying through the air.
Glass sails into a thick tree...  the CRACK OF HIS LEG SNAPPING against the trunk. The rifle falls from his hand. The Grizzly lets out a massive ROAR...  charges Glass. Glass crawls to the Anstadt...  grabs it...  has just enough time to tilt the rifle toward the bear...  BOOM... 
... hits the bear, slowing the animal...  but not enough to stop its attack.
CUT TO:
HENRY - HEARING THE BLAST.
HENRY
UP AHEAD!
Henry takes off at full sprint.	The other men follow.
CUT TO:
GLASS - AS THE BEAR LEAPS ON TOP OF HIM... 
... tosses Glass aside with a powerful swing. Glass hits the ground with a PAINFUL THUD. He starts CRAWLING AWAY, pulling the KNIFE from his belt as the bear rises up like a giant behind him...  swings...  tears its claws across Glass’s back, shredding deep into his flesh.
Glass is fighting for his life now...  flailing with the knife...  slicing it across the bear’s paw as it whips past him. The wound slows the bear enough for Glass to start crawling again.
But the Grizzly doesn’t give Glass the chance...  ROARS...  is on him in a flash, a BLUR OF CLAWS AND FANGS...  tearing across Glass’ chest.
Glass drives his knife into the bear again...  deep...  trying to tear through the layers of flesh to something more vital.
CUT TO:
19.
HENRY - LEADING THE CHARGE THROUGH THE FOREST.
CUT TO:
GLASS AND THE GRIZZLY - FIGHTING THIS EPIC BATTLE... 
... locked in a death grip...  tumbling along the ground...  trading violent blows...  Glass’ blade versus the Grizzly’s claws and fangs...  snapping small trees as they roll over them...  toward the edge of a steep embankment... 
...  and ROLL DOWN...  spinning over and over...  each ROARING AT THE OTHER...  Glass pounding the knife into the bear again and again as they fall...  neither willing to surrender as they careen down the slope at a dizzying pace, then SLAM TO THE BOTTOM WITH A CRUNCH.
The forest falls still...  Glass hidden somewhere beneath the massive animal...  both deathly motionless.
EXT. WOODS - DAY
Bridger’s the first to reach the battleground...  sees the TWO FRIGHTENED BEAR CUBS SCURRY AWAY. He follows the bloody ground and crushed underbrush to the top of the slope...  looks down to the mass of flesh at the bottom.
BRIDGER
Christ Almighty.
Henry, Pig, and the others reach the edge.
HENRY
Glass!
No answer. And all they can see is the bear, so they scan the trees.
PIG
HUGH!
Still nothing. So Bridger takes off down the slope...  losing his balance but rolling back to his feet. He reaches the bear...  sees GLASS’ MANGLED ARM STICKING OUT FROM BENEATH IT.
BRIDGER
He’s down here!
Bridger uses all his strength to push the bear off, as the other men scramble down. But Bridger can’t budge the massive carcass...  not until Stubby Bill and Pig join in...  shove the animal over, revealing the bloody mass that is Hugh Glass... 
20.
... his throat is torn wide open...  stomach and chest a gruesome design of gashes and cuts. His right leg is twisted in a horrible angle.
Bridger’s legs give out...  he drops to a knee and vomits.
MURPHY
Oh, Jesus.
STUBBY BILL
He’s tore to pieces.
The men stare down at Glass’ corpse.
ANDERSON
Least he took that Grizz down with him.
FITZGERALD
Wished he’da done it without firing his rifle. If there wasn’t no ‘Ree around before, there will be now.
And that’s all Pig can stand...  he TACKLES FITZGERALD...  they roll to the ground. And in a flash Fitzgerald is on top, raining punches down on Pig...  turning his face into a bloody mess. Henry and Anderson grab Fitzgerald...  drag him off.
HENRY
THAT’S ENOUGH!
Then somehow, GLASS GASPS...  this horrible, GUTTURAL MOAN.
STUBBY BILL
Holy Christ.
Henry and Bridger fall to their knees beside Glass. Glass looks up at the men, tries to focus through the blood and pain. His breathing is just a GURGLING WHEEZE...  bubbles forming along the deep gashes in his throat with each gasp.
HENRY
Get me some water.
Stubby Bill tosses Henry his canteen. Henry empties it over Glass’ throat...  his chest. The water hits the wounds and immediately transforms to blood.
BRIDGER
Oh, Jesus...  Jesus.
Glass lifts a trembling hand to his throat...  feels the gaping wound. His eyes widen in horror. He COUGHS...  the air splashes blood up from the open wounds.
21.
HENRY
It’s okay, Hugh.
(pushing Glass’ hand away)
You’re going to be fine.
Henry spins his head away from Glass.
HENRY (cont’d)
(whispers)
I need some rags before he bleeds
out.
Pig whips a shirt from his bag...  shreds it.
HENRY (cont’d)
And your whiskey.
Pig tosses a bottle to Henry. Henry pours it over the gashes. The BURNING PAIN arches Glass...  he CRIES OUT in that same HORRIFIC MOAN.
HENRY (cont’d)
Hold him down, Bridger, goddammit.
Bridger throws his weight against Glass’ shoulders.
HENRY (cont’d)
The rest of you spread out...  scout a circle around us. Fitzgerald, you and Anderson take west and north. Murphy and Bill south and east.
Watch for anyone that might’ve
heard that shot.
And for the first time, Henry seems like a leader of men...  firm...  in complete control...  just as Glass said he would be. So the men hurry off to their positions.
PIG
What about me, Cap?
HENRY
Get down here and help me tie off
these wounds best we can.
Pig shakily joins Henry in wrapping the wounds. The blood keeps seeping out, soaking the rags.
PIG
It won’t stop bleedin’.
22.
HENRY
Shut up, Pig.
(to Glass)
We’re fixing you up, Hugh.
Glass is like a shredded rag doll...  dazed eyes staring up at them as they work on his wounds...  wrap the rags around his throat...  across his chest and stomach.
Bridger stares down at Glass with tears in his eyes.
BRIDGER
I’m sorry, Mr. Glass.	I’m sorry.
Henry glances down to the PUDDLE OF BLOOD spilling out over his knees...  oozing out from beneath Glass.
HENRY
Roll him over...  easy.
They gently push Glass onto one side, revealing DEEP, JAGGED, GASHES running across the width of Glass’ back. Henry stares at the open flesh, ready to panic again...  but he doesn’t. Instead he looks to Pig.
HENRY (cont’d)
Get me the kit.	We need to stitch
his back up.
BRIDGER
What about the rest?
HENRY
He’s losing more blood back here.
(off the throat)
And I don’t know what to do with
that yet.
Pig digs out a thick needle and spool of black thread... 
hands it to Henry.	Henry grabs the whiskey bottle.
HENRY (cont’d)
I’m sorry for how this is about to
burn, Hugh.
Henry pours the whiskey over Glass’ back. And the pain must be excruciating, because Glass lets out a HORRIBLE WAIL.
CUT TO:
23.
EXT. WOODS - CONTINUOUS
Fitzgerald and Anderson standing watch together in the trees. Glass’ scream erupts through the trees, and they both immediately crouch down to a knee...  out of sight to anyone out there that might have heard that.
ANDERSON
They’re torturin’ the bastard.
FITZGERALD
And riskin’ gettin’ the rest of us killed in the process. Proper thing would be to end it for him quick.
ANDERSON
‘Less he could pull through.
FITZGERALD
You seen what that grizz did to
him.	Glass’ll be dead inside a
hour.	We all will be if he keeps
screamin’ like that.
EXT. WOODS - LATER
SERIES OF SHOTS
HENRY, BRIDGER AND PIG WORKING OVER GLASS...  Bridger and Pig pressing the skin on Glass’ back together as Henry sutures the wound.
HENRY CLEANING GLASS’ SHREDDED THROAT.
BRIDGER AND PIG HOLDING GLASS DOWN AS HENRY SNAPS GLASS’ LEG BACK IN PLACE...  the pain is too much...  Glass passes out.
FITZGERALD PEERING BACK THROUGH THE TREES...  to Henry doctoring Glass. Fitzgerald shakes his head in anger...  turns back to the darkening forest.
EXT. WOODS - EVENING
Glass rests unconscious on the ground. Two branches act as a splint on his leg. A blanket covers his body...  the stitches stretch to hold his throat together.
Henry crouches a short distance away from him, rinsing his hands under a canteen. Bridger and Pig stand beside him.
BRIDGER
What now?
24.
HENRY
We wait.
(to Pig)
Go tell the others we're making
camp here for the night.
Pig nods...  hustles off.	Henry glances back to Glass.
HENRY (cont'd)
Does he have any kin you know of?
BRIDGER
Never mentioned none.
Henry looks beyond Glass...  to the bear, sprawled on the ground, its claws and fangs soaked with Glass' blood.
HENRY
Have the men gather wood, but make sure it’s dry. We don’t want much smoke when we cook that grizzly.
EXT. WOODS - NIGHT
And what’s left of the grizzly...  its fur cut away...  slabs of flesh butchered from its skeleton.
A fire burns at the center of camp...  a chunk of meat roasts above the flame. The men sit around the fire...  Murphy reaches up...  tears a strip of meat from the roast, tossing it in his mouth. The men are silent...  the pall of Glass’ attack still hanging over them.
Bridger rises...  walks to the Grizzly...  crouches down over it, grabbing the animal’s enormous paw. It dwarfs his own hand, as he examines the massive claws. Bridger pulls out his knife...  stretches the claws out to their full length, and CUTS THEM OFF AT ITS BASE.
FITZGERALD (O.S.)
What makes you think you earned a
claw, boy?
Bridger turns with a start...  ONE OF THE CLAWS FALLS TO THE DIRT. Bridger sees Fitzgerald standing over him, meat in his hand...  his lips shiny with the grease.
FITZGERALD (cont’d)
You didn’t take that grizz down.
BRIDGER
It ain’t for me.
25.
Bridger carries another claw around Fitzgerald...  to the sleeping Glass. Pig’s already crouched beside him. Bridger lifts Glass’ small leather POSSIBLES BAG from beside the Anstadt rifle...  drops the claw inside...  throws a look back to Fitzgerald.
Pig holds his palm out just above Glass’ mouth.
PIG
I can feel some air outta his mouth. Maybe Captain sealed up his throat proper, huh?
(off Bridger’s silence)
Whatta you figure his odds are,
Jim?
Bridger stares down at what’s left of Glass.
BRIDGER
Long.
EXT. CAMP - NIGHT
The fire has burned down to nothing. The men sleep scattered about. Murphy keeps watch just outside of camp.
Glass lies there awake...  eyes wide open...  a living corpse. And his breathing is just as labored as before...  raspy, blood-soaked strains.
Fitzgerald tosses and turns, listening to Glass’ gurgling.
FITZGERALD
You ain’t doin’ him or us no favors, Captain, lettin’ him suffer that way.
Henry’s awake, but doesn’t answer. He’s holding his pistol in his hand, as he stares at Glass...  thinking the same thing Fitzgerald just said. But he doesn’t move...  not yet.
Bridger sits beyond him...  attaching the BEAR CLAW TO A THIN LEATHER STRAP...  a future necklace.
EXT. CAMP - MORNING
ANGLE ON GLASS... 
... awake...  staring upward...  shivering...  beads of sweat covering his face...  those same, weak breaths.
CUT TO:
26.
GLASS' POV... 
... on the morning sky...  the sun pouring in through the treetops...  until a SMALL FIGURE steps into the bright sunlight...  stands over Glass, and all we can make out is the silhouette.
GLASS... 
... blinks...  tries to focus on the figure.
GLASS' POV... 
... on the silhouette...  as it begins to clear...  the FACE OF A YOUNG BOY...  staring down...  scared.
BOY
She's sick again, Pa.
And then we see Glass...  the Glass of years ago...  looking up from beneath a broken wagon axle. He raises up...  sees a farmhouse sitting alone in the middle of a beautiful, wide open Pennsylvania valley.
BOY (cont'd)
Sounds worse this time.
Glass stands...  strides toward the house.
INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY
Glass' WIFE is on her hands and knees in the corner of the room, COUGHING...  hard...  like it's taking every ounce of strength she has.
The door opens, and a square of sunlight pours in over her... 
then Glass' shadow as he enters...  moves to her...  kneels down...  touches her head, and she knocks his hand away.
WIFE
No.	Keep back, Hugh...  please.
Glass hesitates a moment, then strokes her hair again. His wife turns, and we see her face...  deathly pale...  a trickle of blood on her lips...  she's dying.
Glass pulls her against him...  holds her close...  squints back into the doorway of sunlight...  the small shape moving closer...  growing larger...  leaning down...  reaching toward him...  and BECOMING PIG.
27.
PIG
Lookin' better, Hugh.
And then we realize we're back in camp...  with Glass barely hanging onto life...  staring up at Henry, crouching beside Glass...  squeezing Glass' hand.
PIG (cont'd)
Gonna be fine.
Then we see Bridger kneel on the other side of Glass...  press a WET RAG to Glass' head. Henry stands beside him.
Fitzgerald, Anderson, Murphy and Stubby Bill sit huddled a few yards away...  watching.
ANDERSON
Fever’s hit.	Won’t be long now.
FITZGERALD
I seen a bad one drag on days.
ANGLE ON GLASS... 
... eyes still open...  he can hear every word.
FITZGERALD (O.S.) (cont’d) Insides shut down...  flesh starts to spoil and turn. Ain’t no way for-
HENRY (O.S.)
Quiet, Fitzgerald.
FITZGERALD... 
... points a stick at Glass.
FITZGERALD
(to Henry)
We keep sittin’ here watchin’ him
die, only gives the ‘Ree more
chance to run up on us.
Henry doesn’t answer...  just keeps staring down at Glass.
BRIDGER
He’s burnin’, Cap. Water turns to boil as soon as it touches him.
Henry considers this, then... 
28.
HENRY
Pig, take Anderson and scout ahead.
Grand should be just west of here.
Find us the best route.
Pig nods, grabs his gear. He and Anderson take off. Henry turns...  walks over to Fitzgerald and Stubby Bill.
HENRY (cont’d)
(whispers)
You two can start digging a grave.
Fitzgerald tosses the stick away.
FITZGERALD
Least it’s a step in the right
direction.
EXT. CAMP - LATER
Fitzgerald is covered in dirt and sweat, standing knee deep in Glass’ grave. Stubby Bill stands over him.
FITZGERALD
Any coyote digs that deep deserves the meal.
He takes Stubby Bill’s hand...  pulls himself out...  spots Pig and Anderson walking back into camp.
ANDERSON
Found it, Cap.
PIG
No more than a mile or so out.
(for Fitzgerald to hear)
Right where Glass had us headed.
Henry looks to Bridger, still doctoring Glass.
HENRY
We could build a litter. Haul him with us.
ANDERSON
It's rocky and steep goin'.
Henry looks to Pig for an honest answer.
PIG
Marshy on the other side. We could try it, but... 
29.
FITZGERALD
I signed on as a trapper, not a
goddamn mule.
BRIDGER
(to Henry)
Shape he’s in...  I don’t see no way he’d make bein’ drug.
Henry nods, his mind racing for a solution. He turns...  squints out ahead of them...  their trail home. He stares at it a long beat, then lowers his hand back to that pistol...  pulls it from his belt, and turns to Glass.
HENRY
Lay that rag over his eyes, Mr.
Bridger.
The other men all drop their heads...  except for Fitzgerald...  he’s ready to see this end.
BRIDGER
But, Captain.
HENRY
Do it.
PIG
Let's hang on a minute, Cap.
HENRY
(to Bridger)
Now.
Bridger doesn't want to, but follows orders...  reaches to fold the wet rag down over Glass’ wide open eyes. And Glass must know what’s happening, because his eyes roll up to Bridger’s...  then to the Anstadt resting beside him. His lips try to form a word...  his fingers dig into the dirt beside him...  clawing toward that Anstadt... 
... toward that stock with the old carved star.
PIG
He wants his rifle.
Henry hesitates a beat, then nods. Bridger grabs the Anstadt...  rests it in Glass' hand.
PIG (cont’d)
(tears in his eyes)
Here ya are, Hugh.
ANGLE ON GLASS' HAND... 
30.
... feeling its way down to the stock...  pressing his palm against that worn star carving.
Bridger just watches him, then reaches back out to the rag.
