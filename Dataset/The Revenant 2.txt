GLASS’ POV - ON BRIDGER... 
... the boy looking away as he pulls the rag over our eyes... 
everything goes black.
HENRY (O.S.)
Step clear, Mr. Bridger.
A LONG, AGONIZING BEAT in the dark, waiting for that gunshot, then... 
BACK TO SCENE
Henry standing over Glass...  pistol aimed down. His hand trembles slightly.
Pig turns away...  presses his hands over his ears.
Bridger takes a few steps back...  stares at Henry.
Henry struggles to steady his aim, until finally it calms...  because he’s thought of something else. His arm drops to his side.
HENRY (cont’d)
There’s a seventy dollar bonus from the Rocky Mountain Fur Company to the two men that stay with Glass...  see this through.
BRIDGER
I’ll stay with him...  money or not.
PIG
Same here.
Fitzgerald snorts a stifled laugh. Bridger shoots him a look, but even Henry knows Fitzgerald is right...  Bridger and Pig would never survive this alone.
HENRY
Is there a third?
Henry looks to the others...  they all drop their eyes...  not interested.
31.
FITZGERALD
Three won’t stand much chance against a party of ‘Ree, Captain. And seventy dollars won’t buy me a new setta ears.
HENRY
A hundred then.
Still nothing from the others.
BRIDGER
They can have my share too.
FITZGERALD
If Pig feels the same, I'll lag
back with 'em.	I don’t mind
fallin’ a day or so behind for
three hundred dollars.
Pig looks to Bridger, who nods...  so Pig nods too.
HENRY
But Glass is to be cared for until.
Understood?
FITZGERALD
(nods to Bridger)
I’ll let the young doctor do his
job.
Henry hesitates...  doesn’t like this, but knows it’s the best option left.
HENRY
The rest gather your gear.
Bridger reaches down...  lifts the rag from Glass’ face.
Their eyes meet...  Bridger gives Glass a nod.
EXT. CAMP - LATER
Henry and the others are loaded and ready to leave. Henry pulls Bridger aside.
HENRY
As long as necessary. And a proper burial when it's time. He’s earned that.
Bridger nods.	Henry turns...  leads the men into the trees... 
toward the Grand...  toward Fort Union.
32.
EXT. CAMP - DUSK
Bridger and Pig crouch beside Glass, changing his bandages.
Fitzgerald steps in...  lifts Glass' Anstadt from beside Glass.
FITZGERALD
I’ll take first watch.
PIG
You shouldn't use that.
FITZGERALD
Trust me, Dummy, he ain’t gonna be needin’ it tonight.
Glass is helpless to move...  can only watch Fitzgerald disappear into the trees.
Glass' eyes drift back the glowing embers...  the light blurs... 
... becomes the FAINT FLICKER OF A GLOWING LANTERN...  resting
in a dusty window.	Outside the window there's a fresh
grave...  we might even be able to make out the name Elizabeth
Glass on the wooden headstone as we move closer to the
window...  through that twitching flame... 
... and see TWO DARK SHAPES inside...  the larger figure sitting beside a bed...  the smaller one lying in it. It's Glass and the Boy.
INT. HOUSE - NIGHT
TIGHT ON A RIFLE...  GLASS' ANSTADT...  resting across the Boy's lap, as Glass' hands carve a STAR into the fresh stock with a knife. The lantern flame shimmers over them.
The Boy's hands join in...  small and frail, as they brush the wood chips away.
BOY (O.S.)
(tired, weak)
I like the star.
GLASS (O.S.)
So everybody'll know it's yours.
Glass' hand digs away more of the design. Some O.S. COUGHING from the Boy. The small hand runs over the carving, almost caressing it. Then it flinches in pain.
33.
GLASS (O.S.) (cont'd)
Careful.
A BEAD OF BLOOD forms on the little boy's nicked finger...  drops down onto the rifle...  runs along the newly carved design before it’s finally ABSORBED INTO THE FRESH WOOD.
The two pair of hands continue working on the rifle together.
BOY (O.S.)
When can I try it out?
GLASS (O.S.)
Soon as you feel up to it.
A long, quiet beat...  just the scrape of the blade against wood...  the small hands mimicking the movement of the large ones. Then... 
BOY (O.S.)
Will you look after it for me till
then?
Glass' hands stop carving...  maybe even tremble...  just a bit. And before he can answer... 
PIG (V.O.)
You're cheatin', Jim!
CUT TO:
EXT. CAMP - DAY
Glass lying on the ground...  his eyes open...  that same labored breathing, as he looks across camp... 
... to Bridger and Pig stand across camp, playing a game... 
flicking stones into a circle of sticks... 
... as Fitzgerald leans against a tree, staring hard at Glass...  thinking...  all just killing time...  waiting for Glass to die.
EXT. WILDERNESS - DAY
Pig somewhere in the woods, setting up a small snare trap.
EXT. CAMP - DAY
Bridger and Pig kneel on each side of Glass, easing some broth into his mouth...  cleaning his wounds.
34.
Fitzgerald stands in the shadows, taking a piss. He glances over his shoulder to Bridger and Pig.
FITZGERALD
There ya go, pour some more broth down his throat...  keep him alive another week so we can fall farther back. End up walkin’ all the way to Fort Union on our own. ‘Ree would love to poach on just three.
Fitzgerald finishes...  walks past them...  drops to his blanket.
FITZGERALD (cont’d)
I promise ya, you’ll both look a
helluva lot worse than Glass when
they’re done with you.
Pig throws a nervous glance to Bridger, who shakes his head...  don't listen to him.
EXT. WILDERNESS - DAY
Anderson stands on a ridge, scouting a course. He waves back to Henry and the others. They follow after him. Behind them, a THIN LINE OF SMOKE rises from the trees.
EXT. CLEARING - DAY
A DEAD PACK MULE engulfed in flames. A SCALPED TRAPPER lies in the dirt beside it. He's missing his LEFT EAR.
Beyond the Trapper, several Arikara Warriors dig through canvas sacks, pulling out supplies. Elk's Tongue stands over them, his hands wet with blood.
EXT. WILDERNESS - EVENING
From high above...  the sun is sinking over the trees.
EXT. WOODS/RIVER - EVENING
Bridger walks toward the rushing water, carrying empty canteens.
EXT. WOODS - EVENING
Pig pulls a dead raccoon from his snare trap.
35.
EXT. CAMP - EVENING
Fitzgerald sits bored against a tree, eyes locked on Glass as he twists a knife in his hands...  flipping it point first into the dirt...  grabbing...  repeating... 
FITZGERALD
When are you gonna die, Glass?
... twist...  flip...  thwack...  and never pulling his eyes off Glass.
FITZGERALD (cont’d)
Like you shoulda done days ago?
Fitzgerald sits in silence as if he’s waiting for an answer. Finally, he snaps the knife from the dirt, stands, and walks over to Glass...  crouches down...  studies Glass' red, infected wounds.
FITZGERALD (cont’d)
But I'm four days behind Henry's
bunch on accounta tendin' to you.
CUT TO:
EXT. WOODS/RIVER - EVENING
Bridger kneels beside the water, filling the canteens.
CUT TO:
EXT. CAMP - DAY
Fitzgerald holding that knife tip against Glass’ throat.
Glass just staring up at him...  helpless.
FITZGERALD
Be easier on us all if you’d take
that last breath.
The two men hold a stare...  that knife just floating above Glass' skin...  until Fitzgerald finally pulls it back...  grabs a bloodstained rag from beside them...  wads it up.
FITZGERALD (cont’d)
I could help ya with that if you’d
like.	Muzzle ya right now...  end
all this sufferin’ quick and easy.
Nobody’d ever know you give up.
36.
Fitzgerald moves the rag over Glass’ nose and mouth...  holds it there, just inches above.
FITZGERALD (cont’d)
You just gimme a blink if you want
me to do it.
Glass locks his eyes on Fitzgerald’s...  both men unblinking.
A DROP OF BLOOD hangs from the rag...  finally falls...  lands on Glass’ lips.
Fitzgerald almost smiles, waiting for the inevitable...  as Glass stares back, fighting the urge to blink...  but there's no chance he wins this battle. And he finally does... 
... and Fitzgerald's eyes roll up to make sure they're alone.
Then he STUFFS THAT BLOODY RAG INTO GLASS' MOUTH.
Glass struggles against it, but he can barely move...  this is going to end quickly.
FITZGERALD (cont’d)
Easy now.
And Fitzgerald is emotionless about this killing...  almost like he's putting down a piece of livestock... 
... as Glass' struggles weaken...  slow...  it's almost over... 
... until THWACK...  the butt of a rifle smacks Fitzgerald across the head...  knocks him to the dirt...  dazed... 
... as Pig drops down beside Glass...  tries to hold his rifle on Fitzgerald as he tugs that rag out...  helps Glass.
PIG
You okay, Hugh?
(screaming)
JIM!	HURRY!
CUT TO:
EXT. WOODS/RIVER - EVENING
Bridger still beside it. The water rushing past so loud that's all he can hear.
EXT. CAMP - EVENING
Pig's helping Glass breathe, as Fitzgerald rises behind him.
37.
FITZGERALD
I was just doin' your job... 
helpin' to clean him up.
PIG
No.	I saw.	JIM!
FITZGERALD
Shut your mouth, Pig.
Fitzgerald moves toward them.
PIG
Keep away.
(steadying his rifle)
I'm gonna tell Jim and Captain what you did. They’ll hang you... ..
But Pig barely has his rifle aimed before FITZGERALD FLINGS HIS KNIFE INTO PIG’S CHEST. He freezes...  stunned...  the rifle slips from his hands.
FITZGERALD
I told ya to shut up.
And Fitzgerald is on Pig in a flash...  pulling that knife out... 
FITZGERALD (cont’d)
But you stupid sonofabitch wouldn't pay mind, would ya?
Glass struggles to reach for Pig...  to stop Fitzgerald from murdering his friend...  but what's left of his body barely moves.
CUT TO:
GLASS' POV... 
... on Fitzgerald with the knife in his blood-soaked hands... 
finishing Pig off.
FITZGERALD...  looks around for Bridger...  eye contact with Glass.. his mind racing.
He grabs Pig's arms...  drags him out of the camp...  hides his body in the brush...  hurries back in...  slings Pig's rifle and that dead raccoon deep into the trees...  kicks dirt over the spilled blood on the ground... 
38.
... goes back to Pig’s body...  kneels down over him. With the knife, he cuts off Pig’s ears and a piece of scalp, then hides them in a small hole...  covers it with dead leaves.
Then sets his eyes back on Glass...  the only witness... 
staring back.	So Fitzgerald starts for him.
BRIDGER (O.S.)
Breathin' changed?
Fitzgerald spins...  sees Bridger entering camp...  dropping the canteens. He hesitates a beat, then shakes his head.
FITZGERALD
Hadn't noticed.
Bridger moves over to Glass...  kneels down, and Glass grips Bridger's arm...  tries to speak...  can barely open his mouth.
BRIDGER
Easy, Mr. Glass.	He's hot as fire.
Bridger pours some water over a rag...  rests it across Glass' head.
BRIDGER (cont’d)
This'll help.
(to Fitzgerald)
Where’s Pig?
FITZGERALD
Figured he’d joined up with you.
Bridger shakes his head...  scans the forest.
Fitzgerald just slides back down against that tree...  starts shaving a stick with that knife that just gutted Pig. He watches Glass and Bridger...  deciding his next move.
EXT. CAMP - DUSK
Glass awake...  watching Fitzgerald poke at the small fire with a branch. Bridger stands at the edge of camp, squinting out into the darkness.
BRIDGER
Pig!
FITZGERALD
Quiet, kid, goddammit.	Bring the
whole 'Ree tribe on us.
39.
BRIDGER
He shoulda been in by now.
FITZGERALD
Dummy don't know front from back
half the time.	You shouldn'ta let
him wander out alone.
BRIDGER
He was just checkin’ his snares.
Bridger walks deeper into the trees...  just past that brush where Fitzgerald hid Pig's body.
Fitzgerald watches...  regrips that branch...  and we notice it's been shaved to a JAGGED POINT.
But Bridger just turns back... 
BRIDGER (cont’d)
Did you go out to look for him?
FITZGERALD
(off Glass)
Already got my hands full nurse-
maidin’ one.	No time for another.
Bridger scans the forest again, then slides down to the ground next to Glass...  rocks back and forth...  nervous for his friend.
Fitzgerald's eyes drift to Glass...  the men hold a look.
EXT. WILDERNESS - NIGHT
From high above the trees. The world is silent...  peaceful.
CUT TO:
BLACK... 
... the sound of FRENZIED BREATHING.
FITZGERALD (V.O.)
(panicked whisper)
Bridger!	Get your ass up!
Dim light fills the frame...  then we see FITZGERALD’S FACE right in front of us.
FITZGERALD (CONT’D)
‘Ree.
40.
BRIDGER - SCRAMBLES UP FROM THE TREE HE WAS LEANING... 
... wipes the sleep from his eyes.
BRIDGER
What?
FITZGERALD
Keep quiet. There’s twenty of ‘em at least. Down at the creak, but comin’ this way.
BRIDGER
Oh, shit.	Whatta we do?
FITZGERALD
We run.	Now.
BRIDGER
Where's Pig?
FITZGERALD
Not our worry no more.
BRIDGER
We gotta find him.
FITZGERALD
If he ain’t already gutted and
scalped, he’ll find us.
Fitzgerald gathers his bag, starts throwing in food and supplies. Bridger is scared out of his mind...  does the same...  grabs for his rifle, standing near Glass.
Bridger freezes...  in his panic, he’d forgotten all about Glass. And now the wounded man’s eyes stare up at him...  understanding perfectly what’s happening.
BRIDGER
What about Mr. Glass?
FITZGERALD
He’s on his own, same as you and
me.
BRIDGER
I can’t leave him.
FITZGERALD
Then I’m talkin’ to a dead man.
41.
Bridger’s frozen...  doesn’t know what to do. So Fitzgerald suddenly GRABS GLASS BY THE ANKLES...  starts dragging him across the ground. Glass GROANS IN PAIN.
BRIDGER
Wait!
But Fitzgerald isn't waiting...  he pulls Glass to that grave he dug, and ROLLS GLASS' BODY INSIDE.
Glass hits the bottom with a painful THUD.
FITZGERALD
Now we done what was asked of us.
(hard to Bridger)
Move.
Bridger stares at the open grave a moment, then fear sends him running after Fitzgerald... 
... as Glass lies there INSIDE HIS OWN GRAVE.
CUT TO:
GLASS’ POV - OUT OF THE GRAVE...  TIGHT AND CLAUSTROPHOBIC... 
JUST THE NIGHT SKY ABOVE...  AND THE SOUND OF HIS PAINFUL BREATHS.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. WILDERNESS - MORNING
Cold and grey. Fitzgerald crouches beside a small fire, warming his hands. WHISPS OF SMOKE rise into the sky.
FITZGERALD
We ran the better part of the
night.	Had to gain some ground on
Henry and the others.
BRIDGER
Pig won’t know to catch us.
FITZGERALD
He’ll have to.
Bridger sits at the base of a tree...  his mind replaying the desertion of Glass over and over. He notices the smoke.
BRIDGER
Best douse that smoke before them
‘Ree spot it.
42.
FITZGERALD
We put enough distance between us
and them.	And it’s too damn cold
to go without one.
BRIDGER
All we know, they hoofed it through the night same as us.
FITZGERALD
A dozen ‘Ree can’t make the time us two did.
Bridger looks back to the trees.
BRIDGER
We shouldn’t a left him back there.
Fitzgerald doesn’t respond. And then Bridger considers something, stares at Fitzgerald a beat, before... 
BRIDGER (cont’d)
It was twenty earlier.
FITZGERALD
What?
BRIDGER
When you woke me...  you said you’d spotted twenty ‘Ree.
FITZGERALD
A dozen...  twenty. I was a little too spooked to count feathers. Hell, one ‘Ree was too many.
Fitzgerald empties his canteen over the fire, killing the flames. Bridger stares at the water pouring out.
BRIDGER
What was you even doin’ down at the creak in the middle of the night?
(beat)
I’d already brought plenty a water.
Fitzgerald doesn’t answer. Bridger tightens his grip on his rifle...  slowly rises.
BRIDGER (cont’d)
Answer me.
43.
FITZGERALD
Don’t start questionin’ me on
accounta you feelin’ guilty ‘bout
leavin’ your half-breed buddy
behind.
Bridger musters up all the courage he can...  aims his rifle at Fitzgerald.
BRIDGER
ANSWER ME OR I BLOW YOUR DAMN HEAD
OFF!
Fitzgerald stares back at Bridger and his rifle...  eyes taking in everything...  a snake sizing up its prey. Then Fitzgerald stands...  takes a step toward the boy.
FITZGERALD
What’re you askin’? Why it was you turned your back on Glass? Let him die to save your own sorry skin?
(beat)
‘Cause you was scared shitless,
that’s why.
BRIDGER
The ‘Ree...  did you see ‘em?
(off Fitzgerald’s silence)
DID YOU SEE ‘EM?
FITZGERALD
(moving closer)
Not a one.
Bridger CRIES OUT...  starts to pull the trigger, when Fitzgerald’s hand flashes out, grabbing the barrel, and shoving the butt back into Bridger’s face...  THWACK.
The force of the blow knocks Bridger back to the ground, but Fitzgerald holds his grip on the rifle barrel...  flips it around to aim it at the boy. Blood drips down Bridger’s head as he stares up at his rifle pointed down.
FITZGERALD (cont’d)
I just needed to spur you on. Pig was lost, and Glass was dead either way. There weren’t no point in us waitin' around to die too.
Fitzgerald lines the barrel up at Bridger’s head...  his FINGER TIGHTENS ON THE TRIGGER.
44.
FITZGERALD (cont’d)
So that there is the answer to your question.
And Fitzgerald PULLS THE TRIGGER...  AND BRIDGER SQUEEZES HIS EYES SHUT IN FEAR...  THEN CLICK. Bridger opens his eyes...  sees Fitzgerald grinning down at him.
FITZGERALD (cont’d)
And the next time you aim to kill
somebody, boy, best remember your
gun won’t fire without a flint.
Fitzgerald tosses the rifle back at Bridger, and turns away. Bridger’s face flushes with rage and humiliation...  he charges Fitzgerald from behind...  tackles him to the ground...  starts pounding Fitzgerald with punches.
But it’s only a moment before Fitzgerald is in control...  HEAD-BUTTING Bridger off of him...  tossing him away, then KICKING BRIDGER IN THE STOMACH...  AGAIN. He grabs his knife...  is ready to finish Bridger off... 
... but Fitzgerald is smart enough to know that out here, two are safer than one...  even when one is just a kid. He starts walking away.
BRIDGER
I’m goin’ back for him.
FITZGERALD
Far as we ran, you couldn’t find Glass nor your dummy with dogs and a map. And I don’t believe you want to. ‘Cause after leavin’ him to die, I doubt he’d be too happy to see you now.
Fitzgerald digs at the dirt with the knife...  covers the fire’s remains.
FITZGERALD (cont’d) And just so we’re clear. If you try to backtrack without me knowin’, or ever get so guilty you feel the need to tell somebody.
Fitzgerald looks at Bridger...  hard...  evil.
FITZGERALD (cont’d) I’ll have no choice but to gut you from nuts to nose.
45.
Fitzgerald stares his point home, then shoves the blade into his belt, and stands.
FITZGERALD (cont’d)
Now let’s go.
Bridger wipes the blood from his face, then throws one last glance behind him before following Fitzgerald.
EXT. CAMP - MORNING
Empty and quiet...  no sign of life...  until GLASS’ HAND RISES BETWEEN THE LOOSE BRANCHES. His fingers dig into the earth, pulling himself up from the hole...  a dead man climbing out of his own grave.
He rolls out to the ground...  arches in pain when his back hits the cold, hard surface.
Glass lies there shivering, regaining what little strength he has, then rolls over...  glances around the camp...  his eyes settle on the blanket.
He starts dragging himself again with that one good arm...  six inches at a time...  across the dirt...  finally makes it to the blanket...  wraps it around him.
Glass rests there in the center of camp...  unable to move...  his eyes scanning the surroundings...  no food...  no water...  and he’s wide open in this clearing...  an easy target for any predator. So he grabs his Possibles bag and GUNPOWDER HORN, and drags himself toward the cover of brush.
And every movement takes all the will Glass has...  a push with his good leg followed by a pull with his healthy arm... 
inch by inch...  foot by foot...  sweat pouring down his face as he finally reaches the cover of the trees...  continues on...  dragging himself across the forest floor in a desperate, hopeless crawl for survival.
But finally it’s too much for Glass...  the fever and pain overwhelm him. He collapses...  falls unconscious.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. WILDERNESS - NIGHT
From high above the forest...  the tree tops sway in the breeze.
46.
EXT. WILDERNESS - DAY
Glass dragging himself again...  his hands are torn and bloody from clawing his weight.
He stops...  unwraps his small, leather Possibles bag...  dumps it to the ground, revealing it contents...  flints, a straight razor, his map, and a LEATHER NECKLACE WITH THE SIX-INCH BEAR CLAW attached. Glass grabs the razor...  cuts SEVERAL THIN STRIPS FROM THE BLANKET, and wraps them around his hands.
He shoves the rest back in the bag, and does the only thing he can do...  start crawling again...  push with his healthy leg...  pull with his good arm.
EXT. WILDERNESS - LATER
Glass dragging himself up a steep slope...  over rocks...  the jagged edges catching the wounds...  tearing the primitive stitching. The gashes rip wider...  blood oozes down, leaving a crimson trail dripping down the rock behind him.
And we TIGHTEN ON THE BLOOD UNTIL IT BECOMES DARK AS NIGHT.
INT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT
BACK WHERE WE FIRST OPENED...  shadows illuminated by that lantern's flame. The dusty floor...  the bucket of water with a rag hanging over the edge...  the Anstadt Rifle leaning beside the bed...  that FRESH STAR COMPLETED IN ITS STOCK.
Then we see Glass...  more clearly this time...  holding his
Son in his arms...  leaning close...  his face pressed to his
Son's ear.
GLASS
(whispering)
Not yet...  not yet...  not yet.
CUT TO:
EXT. WILDERNESS - NIGHT
And Glass lying beneath a cluster of brush...  shivering... 
bleeding...  conscious but delirious...  staring up at the
sky...  WHISPERING THOSE WORDS HIS WOUNDS WON'T LET HIM SAY... 
over and over...  as a TEAR SLIPS FROM THE CORNER OF HIS EYE.
47.
EXT. WILDERNESS - DAY
Glass pulling himself along the ground...  stopping because he hears something...  RUSHING WATER.
Glass digs his fingers into the ground with new energy...  pulls himself toward the sound...  up over a ridge...  and there it is at the bottom of the ridge... 
... THE GRAND RIVER...  WATER.	Glass crawls down toward it.
EXT. GRAND RIVER - DAY
Glass at the river’s edge, cupping handfuls of water and rubbing it over his parched lips...  withstanding the pain to gulp it down.
Glass cups more water to his mouth, but with each drink, he feels the water leak from a hole in his throat...  run down his neck. He leans out over the surface to check his reflection...  sees the swollen, stitched-together, throat. He fights off the urge to vomit...  pulls the razor from the leather bag, and cuts more strips of blanket, soaking them in the river, then cleaning his wounds.
He runs a finger up to his shredded throat...  around the open, wet hole. He cups another handful of water to his mouth...  strains to swallow, then feels the liquid GURGLE OUT OF THE HOLE.
Glass shoves the cloth against the wound...  tries to press the flesh together...  no good. He dumps out his Possibles bag...  stares at the meager contents. He picks up one of the flints...  looks to the powderhorn.
EXT. GRAND RIVER - LATER
ANGLE ON A SMALL CLUMP OF DRIED GRASS... 
... as Glass SPARKS one of the flints...  ignites the grass. As the fire grows, Glass pours a handful of GUNPOWDER from the horn, and RUBS IT ALL OVER THE HOLE IN HIS THROAT.
He lifts several small blades of burning grass...  a miniature torch. And only then do we realize what he’s about to do... 
because he stares at the flame a beat, then raises it toward his gunpowder-covered throat.
The flame nears the black powder, and LEAPS OFF THE GRASS, igniting the powder, and SETTING GLASS’S NECK ON FIRE.
48.
Glass falls back to the ground in agony...  TRIES TO SCREAM, but his burning, shredded vocal chords won’t allow him.
The gunpowder sizzles and burns...  the flame spreads...  Glass’ flesh sears...  melts...  and the pain is too much for Glass...  he passes out.
The smoke from his neck rises up into the blue sky... 
fades... 
... and then the clouds begin to drift...  fast...  too fast... 
racing across the sky... 
... as we GLIDE BACK DOWN TO... 
GLASS - at the water’s edge, drinking...  touching his charred, melted throat...  no leaks. He slurps back more, then opens his Possibles bag...  pulls out the GRIZZLY CLAW NECKLACE...  stares at it a beat, then slips it over his head.
He drags out a WORN MAP...  spreads it on the ground, then throws a glance around him...  fingers the point on the blue line...  a rough guess of his location.
ANGLE ON THE MAP... 
... Fort Union at the top...  far north. Other smaller outposts south...  but not nearly as far away.
Glass gazes north up the Grand, as if he can see Fitzgerald and Bridger just ahead of him. Then he looks back down to his reflection in the water...  battered and scarred. He touches his leg...  all but worthless for now...  his one good arm. It’s clear he’s not ready to take revenge on anyone.
So Glass shoves the map back into the bag...  ties it around his arm with the powderhorn and blanket, then grabs a THICK, FALLEN LOG, and labors it into the river.
Glass crawls in behind it...  deeper, until the current grows strong enough to carry the weight of his mangled body downstream. Glass drapes his healthy arm over the log, and starts floating...  letting the river do the work.
EXT. GRAND RIVER - DAY
Winding through the open prairie. Glass hangs onto the log...  floats with the gentle current...  past a HERD OF ELK grazing along the riverbank. The animals don't even notice Glass.
49.
EXT. CAMP - DAY
Elk's Tongue stands over Glass' empty grave...  several Warriors watch him study the scene...  the rags crisp with dried blood...  the scattered remains of supplies. Then Elk's Tongue notices a SINGLE BEAR CLAW resting in the dirt. He picks it up.
EXT. GRAND RIVER - NIGHT
Dark...  the moon hidden behind clouds.	A heavy mist hangs
over the river.	Glass is draped across the log, eyes
closed...  letting the slow current carry him south.	But then
his eyes open...  because he hears something...  a LOW RUMBLE.
Glass looks to the river banks...  too foggy to see anything clearly. The RUMBLE GROWS LOUDER. He peers ahead...  too dark to see much...  just ANOTHER SPLINTERED LOG floating in front of him, its one jagged branch rising up in the air.
But then THE LOG VANISHES. Glass squints through the fog, scanning the surface. But it’s gone...  the water’s empty...  that LOW RUMBLE GROWS EVEN LOUDER.
Glass looks to the water beside him...  a BRANCH GLIDES PAST AT A HIGHER SPEED. And now Glass knows what’s coming, but it’s too late...  because the world suddenly turns upside down, as Glass tumbles over the edge of a TWENTY FOOT WATERFALL.
He spirals downward...  crashes into the rushing current. He’s washed forward with the suddenly violent rapids. They pull him under the surface, then toss him GASPING back out.
The river carries him blindly through the mist...  tossing...  turning...  SLAMMING HIM INTO A HUGE BOULDER...  CRACK...  he spins off, swept away headfirst...  the foaming water sucking him down the rocky gauntlet.
He tumbles over more boulders...  his Possibles bag snaps loose...  Glass makes a grab for it, but is suddenly flipped down another set of falls.
The Possibles Bag is lost in the raging river.
Glass sinks beneath the surface, then floats back up, as the rapids calm...  spit Glass to the gentle shallows. His body drifts face-down toward shore.
And just when we’re sure Glass has to finally be dead, his arm reaches up from the water...  his hand clamps onto the muddy bank, and drags his body out of the river.
50.
Glass collapses unconscious to the ground, his body shrouded in that mist.
EXT. GRAND RIVER - DAY
TIGHT ON THE LEFT SIDE OF GLASS’ FACE...  the right still pressed into the muddy bank. The sun beats down...  then SHADOWS APPEAR...  BOUNCE ACROSS HIM...  something is standing over Glass.
And then a VULTURE’S HEAD DROPS INTO FRAME... 
... latches its beak onto Glass’ cheek...  tugs at it...  stretches it. Glass’ eyes pop open...  we PULL BACK to see THREE VULTURES surrounding Glass’ body, pecking and clawing at his battered wounds.
Glass swings his good arm, knocking one of the vultures away. He tries to cry out, but only that PRIMITIVE HISS ERUPTS from his throat.
The vultures dance away from his flailing...  aren’t willing to give up their meal so easily...  dart in for quick attacks on his flesh.
Glass grasps a branch...  swings at the birds, beating them back. The vultures give up the battle...  fly away.
Glass crumbles back to the ground...  squints up into the sun...  the SILHOUETTES OF THE VULTURES CIRCLING ABOVE HIM...  waiting for him to die.
Glass glances to a ridge just a few hundred yards away.
At the base of the ridge, a GIANT BOULDER has broken free, creating a partial cave. Glass starts crawling toward it.
And if it’s possible, he looks even closer to death now than when he started this journey.
EXT. CAVE - DAY
No more than ten feet deep, but enough to hide from predators. Glass slides as far back in the recess as he can...  collapses against the rock wall.
INT. CAVE - DAY
Glass gathers loose sticks and grass into a small pile... 
begins sparking rocks together to build a fire.
51.
INT. CAVE - LATER
The fire burns beside Glass, as he TEARS A SINGLE THREAD of cloth from the tattered blanket, then feeds it through a tiny hole in a JAGGED, NEEDLE-SIZED SLIVER OF SHARPENED ROCK...  a man-made needle and thread.
Glass goes to work on the open wounds of his chest...  piercing his skin with the rock...  wincing with pain as he tugs the thread through the fresh hole in his skin...  pierces the other side of the wound, then pulls the flesh tightly together...  before repeating the excruciating process all over again...  pierce...  pull...  pierce...  tighten.
EXT. GRAND RIVER - NIGHT
The moon’s glow reflects off the water.
INT. CAVE - NIGHT
ANGLE ON GLASS’ HAND... 
... holding a small sharp stone, and SCRATCHING LETTERS INTO THE CAVE’S ROCK WALL.
WE PAN DOWN TO THE GROUND...  still listening to the SCRATCHING OF THE ROCK as we glide across the dirt...  reach the fire...  its flame warm and strong.
We TIGHTEN ON THE FIRE, until WE’RE INSIDE IT...  and then WE PULL BACK... 
... and we see the fire has long died away...  just black ash. The O.S. SCRATCHING has silenced. We glide back across the cave floor...  to Glass unconscious on the ground. And above him on the wall, we see what he had been scratching... 
“Robbed and left to die by Fitzgerald. Killed Pig to. If find him kill for Hugh Glass”
We hold on those words a beat, then... 
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. WILDERNESS - DAWN
Still dark and misty. Bridger asleep beneath a thick cover of trees. An O.S. GUNSHOT springs his eyes open...  then ANOTHER SHOT...  and ANOTHER.
52.
Bridger looks around...  sees Fitzgerald's gear...  but no Fitzgerald. Bridger scrambles to his feet.
EXT. SMALL CAMP - MORNING
TWO INDIAN PONIES prance anxiously...  pull at the ropes that secure them to trees.
And then we see why they're jumpy...  Fitzgerald's standing over the bodies of TWO DEAD CROW INDIANS...  gathering their weapons. He looks up...  sees Bridger standing in the mist...  staring at the scene...  shocked.
FITZGERALD
They'da done the same if they'd
found us first.
Bridger doesn't respond...  just watches Fitzgerald pull his knife...  crouch over one of the bodies.
FITZGERALD (cont'd)
Gather the horses.	We might even
survive to Union now.
Then Fitzgerald moves the blade toward the Crow's head... 
pulls the long black hair back.
FITZGERALD (cont'd)
(to the dead body)
Be grateful I kilt you first.
EXT. GRAND RIVER - DAY
DROPS OF RAIN dot the surface. THUNDER RUMBLES...  the rain grows heavier.
EXT. CAVE - NIGHT
Rain pouring...  gullies of water run down the ridge, spewing over the mouth of the cave. But inside, Glass doesn’t stir...  lying there just as we last saw him.
EXT. GRAND RIVER - DAY
Rain coming down in buckets. The river’s swollen and flooded...  raging.
53.
EXT. WILDERNESS - NIGHT
Clouds drift across the moon...  the storm has ended.
INT. CAVE - DAY
TIGHT ON GLASS’ FACE...  eyes closed.	He looks dead.
BOY'S VOICE (V.O.)
Not yet.	Not yet.
Glass' eyes suddenly spring open.
EXT. CAVE - DAY
Glass crawls out of the crevice...  shields his eyes from the sun, as he takes in the scene.
The river has sunk back to normal, leaving the banks battered and muddy. The water is thick and brown with all the flooded earth it pulled up.
Glass uses all his strength to rise up to his knees, then higher...  onto his healthy leg. He braces himself against a tree. He’s still crooked and hunched over, but for the first time since the Grizzly attack, he looks more like a man than an animal. He bends down...  picks up a BROKEN TREE BRANCH.
EXT. GRAND RIVER - DAY
Glass limps along the bank...  beside the brown water stirred up from the flood. He moves along the washed-out area, searching for food...  grabs some plants...  tears them from the ground to chew on the roots.
He continues on...  spots a DEAD SNAPPING TURTLE drowned in the flood, frozen on its back. Glass kneels down to pick up the turtle...  sniffs it. As he does, he spots something across the river...  a DEER, staring back at him.
Glass slowly raises his IMAGINARY RIFLE...  takes careful aim at the deer...  pulls the trigger. If only he had his Anstadt.
But then the deer’s head snaps...  to something beyond Glass. Glass follows the animal’s eyes...  turns to the ridge...  and sees FIVE ARIKARA WARRIORS STANDING AT GLASS’ CAVE.
Glass drops flat to the ground behind a tree uprooted in the flood. He looks back across the river...  THE DEER IS GONE.
54.
INT. CAVE - DAY
Elk's Tongue stands at the wall, staring at the words Glass etched into the rock. He picks up a piece of shredded cloth...  sniffs it, then says something to the Warriors.
EXT. GRAND RIVER - DAY
Glass inches his head up over the tree...  to Elk's Tongue, now outside the cave...  studying the tracks.
Glass’ eyes jump to the soft dirt along the river...  HIS FOOTPRINTS...  an obvious trail leading right to him. He throws a glance around...  nowhere to run even if he could. So he starts backing into the river on his stomach...  feet-first...  dragging a small branch over the tracks around him, wiping them away as he moves. And his eyes are locked on the Arikara...  watching to see if they spot him.
But they haven’t yet, and Glass keeps sliding backward...  five feet off shore...  only three feet deep in the murky water and sludge. But if he goes any further, the current will catch him...  pull him into the next set of violent rapids...  and make him a clear target.
The Arikara follow the tracks down from the cave.
Glass sinks neck-deep into the water...  the Arikara keep coming...  near the river. So Glass drops beneath the surface.
CUT TO:
UNDERWATER -
And Glass’ eyes spread wide...  searching the muddy water. He grabs a LARGE ROCK...  rolls onto his back, and places the rock on his stomach, its weight holding him firmly to the river bottom.
EXT. GRAND RIVER - DAY
ANGLE ON THE ARIKARA WARRIORS...  following Glass’ tracks to the edge of the river...  looking out over the brown river.
CUT TO:
55.
UNDERWATER -
Glass pressing his head back against the bottom...  staring up through the cloudy water...  to the FIVE SHADOWS STANDING ONLY A FEW FEET AWAY.
EXT. GRAND RIVER - CONTINUOUS
Elk's Tongue and the others...  unknowingly standing just above Glass...  looking back to the tracks...  scanning the water. But the surface is empty, and the river’s too thick with mud to see anything below.
But they keep looking...  and we’re waiting for Glass to explode from the river, gasping for air. But he doesn’t... 
and they keep scanning for what seems an eternity, until finally, Elk's Tongue turns...  the Warriors follow him back toward the cave.
Behind them, Glass’ face inches to the surface...  pulls in some oxygen...  watches as they fade into the trees.
Then Glass rolls the rock away...  starts moving deeper into the river...  fighting the current to grab rocks and boulders...  pulling himself to the other side.
EXT. PRAIRIE - EVENING
Glass limps slowly across the rolling prairie. He’s weak...  starving...  isn’t going to make it much further. He drops to his hands and knees.
And then he feels something...  the ground almost trembling under his hands. He watches his hands quiver with vibration. A RUMBLE BUILDS. Glass strains to hear...  looks to the crest of a hill...  labors up the gentle slope toward the sound.
EXT. PRAIRIE/HILL - EVENING
Glass reaches the crest...  looks over the other side to a HERD OF BUFFALO THUNDERING ACROSS THE PRAIRIE.
An incredible site...  hundreds of massive creatures...  their hooves tearing up the earth, leaving a cloud of dust behind them.
Behind the herd, a PACK OF WOLVES FIGHT OVER A FALLEN BUFFALO.
56.
Glass lies in the high grass, watching the wolves SNARL AND SNAP over the remains. And he eyes that buffalo...  the closest he’s been to food in days.
He scans the ground for a weapon...  nothing. And then his eyes settle on some DEAD SAGE BRUSH. He grabs them, along with some sticks...  rocks...  pulls them into a pile.
