EXT. PLAINS - NIGHT
The five wolves rest around the downed buffalo, their snouts bloody from the meal. Suddenly, one of the wolves’ heads snaps up...  bares its teeth...  SNARLS.
And then we see what the wolf is growling at...  Glass...  limping out of the shadows toward the animals, holding a BURNING SAGE BUSH IN EACH HAND...  like giant FLAMING HANDS clawing in the night.
The wolves jump to their feet, unsure of what’s approaching. They growl at Glass. But Glass keeps coming...  doing his best to YELL...  more like GROWL back at the wolves. He swings the flaming brush, tossing glowing sparks through the air.
The wolves spread out, instinctively surrounding Glass. But Glass singles out each one...  charges, waving the flames...  driving each wolf back.
Four of the wolves back away, but the leader holds its ground...  even moves toward Glass...  only a few feet away... 
SNARLING...  bloody jaws ready to attack, but still not sure what its up against.
Glass shakes the flames at the wolf...  it SNAPS AT GLASS’ ARM. Glass swings the other...  slams the fiery plant across the wolf’s head.
The wolf YELPS...  leaps back...  starts to run away, but turns back...  makes another charge at Glass. But Glass is ready... 
throws the flaming ball of sage at the wolf, then clubs it with the other. The animal’s fur begins to burn.
The frightened wolf has had enough...  rolls on the ground, then spins to join the rest of its pack. They run a safe distance, then stop...  keeping a watch on Glass.
Glass drags the burning sage bushes along the ground, igniting the grass and brush...  creating a foot-high flaming wall between him and the wolves.
He stretches the flame into a circle, a fiery ring surrounds the fallen buffalo.
57.
The wolves have seen enough...  turn...  race away from the flames.
As the grass around him burns, Glass drops the sage plants...  attacks the buffalo remains, tearing away bloody chunks of flesh from the carcass, and shoving them into his mouth...  a starving animal that’s finally found food.
EXT. PRAIRIE - NIGHT
From high above the prairie...  Glass and the buffalo at the center of that glowing ring of fire.
EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY
The wind’s gusting...  bending the high golden grass over on its side. Glass moves slowly across, pulling his collar up to shield his face from the cold winds. He spots something in the distant sky ahead...  a THIN LINE OF BLACK SMOKE. Glass picks up his pace...  hope spurring him on.
EXT. BURNED ARIKARA VILLAGE - DAY
The charred, skeletal remains of a tribe’s village...  just black posts where tee-pees once stood...  a half-burned log lodge still smokes, sending that black line into the sky.
Glass limps through the graveyard of structures...  all signs of life in this village long gone. He searches a basket...  pulls out a BLANKET...  wraps it around his shoulders.
INT. LODGE - DAY
Glass steps into the smoky warmth of the lodge...  black and empty. He slides down to the floor...  unwraps strips of roasted buffalo from what’s left of his blanket. He starts to take a bite, when SOMETHING DARTS PAST THE DOORWAY TO THE BACK ROOM. The O.S. SHUFFLING OF FEET.
Glass freezes...  he isn’t alone. He rises...  grabs a splintered post like a spear...  eases toward the doorway...  raises the post to swing... 
... and sees the SMALL PUPPY standing in the back room. The dog takes off around a crumbled wall. Glass follows it.
58.
INT. LODGE/BACK ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Glass limps across the room...  turns the corner of the crumbled wall...  and sees the dog slide to a stop beside an ANCIENT ARIKARA WOMAN, huddled in the corner, her bony arms outstretched in front of her in weak defense. And her eyes are SOLID WHITE...  the old woman is blind. She CRIES OUT A CHANT over and over...  her death chant, as she waits for this stranger to kill her.
Glass stands frozen...  confused. He tries to speak, but his throat still won’t let him. He crouches down in front of the old woman...  reaches for her hand, but she flails him away.
He grabs her again...  gently...  just holds it until she calms...  studying the woman...  her hollow face all skin and bones...  she’s obviously dying.
He pulls the strip of buffalo meat from his pocket...  pushes it into the woman’s hand. She immediately jerks it to her mouth...  and that’s when Glass sees the WOMAN HAS NO TEETH...  she can’t eat.
Glass turns to an old pot tipped over on the floor.
EXT. BURNED ARIKARA VILLAGE - DAY
Glass carries the pot toward a nearby stream. The dog scurries out behind him...  follows Glass to the water.
INT. LODGE/BACK ROOM - DAY
The pot boils over burning logs. Glass dips a cup in, pulling out a warm broth. He carries it to the woman, still sitting in the corner...  takes her hand, placing the cup in it for her. She gulps the liquid back.
Glass goes back to refill the cup. The old woman MUMBLES SOMETHING we can’t understand...  over and over, as Glass brings the cup back to her. He tries to ease it into her hand, but the woman pushes it away...  slides her hand up Glass’ arm to his face...  patting it...  MUMBLING THOSE SAME WORDS...  thanking Glass.
EXT. BURNED ARIKARA VILLAGE - EVENING
Glass carries several blankets toward the lodge. The puppy trails behind him, biting at one of the corners...  hanging on as Glass pulls him across the dirt.
59.
INT. LODGE - EVENING
Glass enters the back room with the blankets...  stops when he sees the old woman slumped over to the floor, her white eyes frozen open in a lifeless stare...  the cup of broth spilled beside her.
The dog scampers over...  starts licking up the wet remains of the broth.
EXT. BURNED ARIKARA VILLAGE - NIGHT
Glass has stacked several burned posts into a crude pyre at the edge of the village. The woman lies atop the pyre, covered in the blankets he gathered for her.
EXT. DISTANT RIDGE - CONTINUOUS
THREE INDIANS sit on horseback, watching Glass walk away from the pyre.
EXT. BURNED ARIKARA VILLAGE - NIGHT
As Glass and the dog walk across the village...  something else appears beyond them... 
... THOSE THREE INDIANS GALLOPING TOWARD THE VILLAGE...  FAST.
Glass hears them...  turns...  knows it’s too late to run, so he just stands there. The dog’s seen enough...  darts away.
Glass watches the Indians ride into the village...  their braided hair and dress is different than the Arikara we’ve seen earlier, because these are SIOUX WARRIORS, and Glass knows it.
The Sioux surround Glass on horseback...  stare down at him. The lead warrior (SPOTTED HORSE), (30’s), poised and strong, points to the pyre...  says something to Glass.
Glass tries to answer...  can’t...  touches his scarred throat. Spotted Horse slides gracefully off his horse. The other two warriors, (THREE FEATHERS and RUNNING FOX) do the same...  close in on Glass.
Glass stands firm. Spotted Horse questions Glass again. And again, Glass touches his throat...  holds his jacket out from his sides...  no weapons. Spotted Horse studies Glass hard... 
spots Glass’ necklace...  the grizzly claw hanging from it. He examines the enormous claw, then nods to Glass’ stitching and scars.
60.
SPOTTED HORSE
Griz-lee.
Glass hears the familiar word...  nods. Three Feathers SNIFFS GLASS...  says something to Spotted Horse.
Spotted Horse walks around Glass...  spots the BLOOD STAINS along the back of Glass' shirt. Spotted Horse pulls out his knife.
Glass is confused...  holds up his hand, as he takes a step back. But Three Feathers and Running Fox grab Glass...  secure him, as Spotted Horse raises the knife.
Glass GROWLS A PLEA...  but Spotted Horse slices the knife down Glass’ back...  just cutting open his shirt... 
... and revealing a MASS OF WHITE WORMS...  MAGGOTS...  COVERING GLASS’ BACK.
The three warriors exchange glances...  they’ve obviously never seen anything like this. Glass sees their reaction... 
tries to pull away, but Spotted Horse SLAMS THE BUTT OF HIS KNIFE against Glass’ head.
Glass drops to his knees...  crumbles unconscious to the dirt.
Spotted Horse says something to the others...  they drag Glass toward the horses...  throw him over the back of Three Feather's horse, then ride out of the village.
EXT. SIOUX VILLAGE - NIGHT
Dozens of glowing campfires dot the prairie, along with a sea of tee-pees, their willow poles fanning against the night sky. Animal hides and painted designs decorate the various tee-pees and lodges. SIOUX CHILDREN laugh and play about the village...  freeze when they hear Spotted Horse and the other riders splash across the stream.
The warriors ride into the village, Glass’ body still tossed over the back of Three Feather’s horse. The children race to them.
ANGLE ON GLASS...  regaining consciousness...  eyes blinking... 
trying to focus.
CUT TO:
GLASS’ POV - FROM THE BACK OF THE HORSE... 
... to the children’s eager faces swarming around him.
61.
Spotted Horse - YELLING SOMETHING at the children...  they back away from Glass...  fall into line behind the riders.
Sioux MEN and WOMEN watch as the procession moves past...  to a tee-pee set away from the rest...  its hide walls decorated with wild lightning bolts and buffalo and vaguely human figures circling the sun.
An OLD MEDICINE MAN, gnarled and leathery, a DEAD RAVEN tied in his long hair, his naked chest painted with red and black stripes, steps out of the tee-pee. He eyes Glass, as Three Feathers and Running Fox carry him inside.
Suddenly, the Medicine Man begins CHANTING.
CUT TO:
A FLURRY OF IMAGES ACCOMPANIED BY THE MEDICINE MAN’S V.O.
CHANTING... 
LEATHER STRAPS SNAPPING AROUND GLASS’ WRISTS AND ANKLES... 
stretched tight.
Glass, naked, on his stomach at the center of the tee-pee, his arms and legs outstretched, secured to wooden stakes in the ground. The infected wounds exposed.
The Medicine Man...  CHANTING...  waving burning sticks in the air.
A THICK LIQUID BOILING IN A POT...  the Medicine Man’s twisted hand reaching a gourd container in...  filling it with the steaming mixture.
The liquid POURING OVER GLASS’ BACK.
GLASS’ FACE...  arched to the sky...  twisted in horrible pain.
He SCREAMS THAT HORRIBLE GROWLING CRY.
MORE IMAGES...  even faster...  the CHANTING more frantic... 
A SIOUX WOMAN,(WAKI), staring down.
HANDS pouring HOT OIL over Glass' wounds.
The Medicine Man dancing...  chanting...  shaking sticks lined with RATTLESNAKE TAILS.
The moonlight shining through the tee-pee, illuminating the images of the buffalo and dancing shapes.
The LITTLE BOY, (Glass' Son), standing over Glass...  just watching him.
62.
Waki gently pouring fluid into Glass’ mouth.
The Medicine Man holding the SEVERED HEAD OF A SNAKE... 
lightly sinking the fangs around the wounds on Glass’ throat.
GLASS’ EYES...  wide open...  rolling up white into his head.
AND THE CHANTING STOPS...  the world goes dark.
EXT. YELLOWSTONE RIVER - DAY
Cutting through the open prairie. Snow-covered peaks touch the sky in the distance.
Fitzgerald and Bridger dressed in furs...  ride the two horses bareback across the prairie. They rise up a steep slope... 
reach the top, and spot the cluster of log buildings inside a massive thirty-foot tall wooden fence. Fort Union.
Bridger smiles...  relieved.
FITZGERALD
‘Bout goddamn time.
Fitzgerald gives Bridger a stern gaze.
FITZGERALD (cont’d)
And we’re understood on
everything...  Glass’ dyin’ in his
sleep...  us buryin’ him like was
agreed.
Bridger doesn’t respond.	Fitzgerald doesn’t like that.
FITZGERALD (cont’d) You’re as guilty as me in leavin’ him. Don’t you forget that. You got a future up here. No sense tossin’ it away when he was as good as dead already. Shit, all we did was skip the funeral.
Bridger digs his heels into the horse...  rides on.
FITZGERALD (cont’d)
I won’t take well to givin’ up that two-hundred on accounta you gettin’ weak-kneed.
Bridger keeps riding away.	Fitzgerald follows behind.
63.
INT. FORT UNION - DAY
Like a small town surrounded by a log wall. The main TRADING POST BUILDING is busy...  TRAPPERS, SIOUX, all with things to trade. But most of the life is in the FORT UNION SALOON next door...  crowded with customers downstairs, and just as busy in the whores’ rooms upstairs.
A small village of tents rests off to the side of the buildings, holding the overflow of traffic.
INT. ROCKY MOUNTAIN FUR COMPANY OFFICE - DAY
Henry sits at his desk. Fitzgerald and Bridger stand across from him. The others...  Anderson, Murphy, and Stubby Bill crowd the room behind them.
FITZGERALD
We figure Pig musta wandered too far...  got turned around or jumped by some ‘Ree. Me and the kid hunted for him.
Fitzgerald looks to Bridger for confirmation. Bridger manages a slight nod.
HENRY
What about Glass?
FITZGERALD
I won’t pretend to been his friend, but I respect any man that fights the way he done.
HENRY
And the grave?
FITZGERALD
We had those extra days so we went deeper...  covered it in rocks. To keep the scavengers off him.
HENRY
Any sign of hostiles?
FITZGERALD
Not a one.
The words are like a punch in the gut to Bridger. He can’t take the pain...  opens his mouth to speak, but Fitzgerald beats him to it.
64.
FITZGERALD (cont’d) Truth is, I was worried ‘bout ‘Ree, and ready to get movin’, but Bridger here argued to stay and make a cross for the grave.
Bridger’s head snaps to Fitzgerald...  don’t make this worse.
FITZGERALD (cont’d)
So that’s what we did.
Stubby Bill reaches up...  gives Bridger a pat on the back.
But to Bridger, it feels like a red-hot blade.
HENRY
Glad to hear you pulled your
weight, Mr. Bridger.	I knew you
would.
FITZGERALD
More than his share, Captain.
And now Fitzgerald has snared Bridger into his lie. Bridger drops his eyes to his feet.
HENRY
Speaking of shares.
Henry turns to a SAFE resting against the wall. Fitzgerald watches as Henry spins the dial...  locks in the combination, then pulls the latch. The safe door swings open... 
... revealing STACKS OF CASH.
Fitzgerald’s eyes lock on all that money. Henry pulls out a handful...  starts counting them out onto the desk.
HENRY (cont’d)
Am I to assume the agreed
arrangement didn’t change?
FITZGERALD
Fortunate for me, it did not.
HENRY
Well thank you both for your
courage and honor.
Fitzgerald swipes up his pile of bills. Henry drops a couple bills in front of Bridger.
HENRY (cont’d)
You’re owed something for what you did.
65.
Bridger stares down at the bills a beat, then turns...  leaves them there as he pushes his way out of the office. Henry looks to Fitzgerald.
FITZGERALD
He’s beat hisself up most of the
trip...  wishin’ he’da done more.
HENRY
Sounds like there was no more to be done.
FITZGERALD
That’s what I been tellin’ him.
INT. FORT UNION/BUNKHOUSE - DAY
Empty, except for Bridger curled up on his cot, sobbing.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. TEE-PEE - DAY
Glass sleeps under a buffalo hide.	His eyes flicker open.
CUT TO:
GLASS’ POV - ON THE BUFFALO AND DANCING FIGURE DESIGNS SHADOWED THROUGH THE TEE-PEE.
GLASS - His hand reaching up to his throat. It looks much better than we last saw.
He stiffly raises himself up...  remembers his back... 
struggles to reach behind him...  scarred but clean.
He looks beside him...  sees SIOUX PANTS AND SHIRT resting on the ground...  waiting for him.
EXT. TEE-PEE - DAY
ANGLE ON GLASS...  dressed...  pushing his way out through the flap of the tee-pee...  limping out into the midday sun, and shielding his eyes. He looks like a man that hasn’t seen the light of day for weeks.
Glass adjusts to the brightness...  stares in wonder at the scene. And then we see what Glass is looking at, and understand his reaction... 
66.
the entire village is blanketed in snow. The Sioux VILLAGERS move about, wearing heavy skins and furs.
A WOMEN’S O.S. VOICE turns Glass... 
... to WAKI, the woman from the images, walking toward him,
bundled in fur. She says something else we can’t
understand...  points to Glass’ feet.	Glass looks down...  to
his BARE FEET BURIED DEEP IN THE SNOW.	He hadn’t noticed.
And then Waki smiles...  a sweet, pretty smile. She takes his hand...  leads him back into the tee-pee.
INT. TEE-PEE - CONTINUOUS
Glass and Waki enter. She pulls a pair of moccasins from a basket...  hands them to Glass. He slips them on, then presses his fingers against his throat...  almost trying to hold it all inside to make it work, then... 
GLASS
(scratching and rough)
Thank you.
Waki doesn’t understand...  just hands him his BEAR CLAW NECKLACE. Glass nods in thanks, then achingly lifts his arms up to slip it over his head.
GLASS (cont’d)
How long have I been here?
Waki just stares back...  no idea what Glass said.
GLASS (cont’d)
You’re Sioux.	I only know a bit a
Pawnee.
Glass stumbles through a sentence of Pawnee. Waki shakes her head...  throws a jumble of Sioux back at him.
GLASS (cont’d)
The snow...  my healin’.
(points to himself)
Me.
(points to the ground)
Here.	How long?
Waki shakes her head again.	Glass leads her outside.
67.
EXT. SIOUX VILLAGE - CONTINUOUS
Glass points to the sun overhead, then raises both hands, fingers outstretched.
GLASS
How many suns?	Ten?
Waki studies Glass...  the sun...  begins to understand. She nods...  SAYS A WORD...  holds up all ten of her fingers.
GLASS (cont’d)
Ten suns?
Then Waki closes her hands into fists...  opens them again.
GLASS (cont’d)
Christ.
Glass glances around...  for the first time, notices Sioux MEN and WOMEN staring at him. Children freeze in the middle of their play...  all eyes locked on Glass. TWO SMALL BOYS, (NEW MOON and LITTLE ONE), repeat the same TWO WORDS... 
Children freeze in the middle of their play...  all eyes locked on Glass. TWO SMALL BOYS repeat the same TWO WORDS to each other... 
BOYS
Mato Wicasa.
... over and over.
Glass stares back, unsure.	Then... 
SPOTTED HORSE (O.S.)
Griz-lee Man.
Glass turns...  sees Spotted Horse stepping out of a tee-pee.
SPOTTED HORSE (cont'd)
(points to Glass’ scars)
What they call you.
Glass nods...  smiles. The children smile and laugh now too...  repeat the words LOUDER.
SPOTTED HORSE (cont’d)
Is a strong name.
GLASS
You speak English.
68.
SPOTTED HORSE
Need words trade with whites.
GLASS
Well I’m grateful for you bringing me here...  havin’ them care for me.
(off Spotted Horse’s nod)
Now if you could point me which way it is you do your tradin’...  with the whites.
SPOTTED HORSE
Whites.	Bra-zo.
GLASS
Fort Brazeau?
Spotted Horse points into the distance.
GLASS (cont'd)
South of here?
(points opposite way)
I need to be north.	Fort Union.
Do you know Fort Union?
SPOTTED HORSE
(nods)
Yoon-yun.
GLASS
How far?
SPOTTED HORSE
Many days ride.
Glass considers this.
GLASS
I could trade you for a horse.
Come back with furs...  blankets.
Spotted Horse shakes his head...  starts walking...  motions for Glass to follow.
SPOTTED HORSE
We eat first.
Glass follows after him. The children sneak in behind, giggling as they tail Glass across camp.
Glass glances back...  New Moon and Little One duck behind a tee-pee...  wait for him to continue before they scoot back out after him.
69.
INT. CHIEF’S LODGE - NIGHT
Glass, Spotted Horse, Three Feathers, Running Fox and OTHER WARRIORS sit around a fire, eating with CHIEF RED HAWK, the Medicine Man, and several other TRIBAL ELDERS.
GLASS
The man killed my friend. Stole my rifle.
The Sioux don’t understand. Glass reaches over, taking Spotted Horse’s plate.
GLASS (cont’d)
They took.	They took... 
Glass aims an imaginary rifle.
GLASS (cont’d)
... my rifle.	My gear.
Now Spotted Horse understands...  translates for the others.
GLASS (cont’d)
Left me to die. So I mean to find ‘em both. Get my rifle back.
Spotted Horse translates again. Red Hawk nods, studying Glass.
Red Hawk SAYS SOMETHING to Glass...  motions to the BEAR CLAW NECKLACE. Glass looks to Spotted Horse.
SPOTTED HORSE
Red Hawk ask who kill griz-lee.
Glass touches his chest. Red Hawk nods, impressed. Glass points to the JAGGED SCARS running up Red Hawk’s neck to a MISSING RIGHT EAR.
GLASS
Grizzly?
Red Hawk smiles...  shakes his head.
RED HAWK
Arikara.
That word, Glass understands. Red Hawk rambles a long sentence in Sioux...  motions at Glass. The others LAUGH.
70.
SPOTTED HORSE
He say Arikara take right ear of
Sioux.	Left ear of whites.	Now
will take both from Mato Wicasa.
Glass glances to the Sioux clothes he’s wearing...  nods and smiles along with the others. They continue their meal.
EXT. SIOUX VILLAGE - NIGHT
The village is silent.
INT. TEE-PEE - NIGHT
Glass rests on the buffalo rug, staring up at the designs painted above him.
EXT. SIOUX VILLAGE - MORNING
Busy with activity.	Spotted Horse walks to Glass' tee-pee... 
enters.
INT. TEE-PEE - CONTINUOUS
Spotted Horse stands inside the empty tee-pee...  sees GLASS' GRIZZLY CLAW NECKLACE resting on the buffalo hide.
EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY
Open, snow-dusted prairie for as far as the eye can see. And the speck that is Hugh Glass, alone at the center...  walking north.
EXT. FORT UNION - DAY
But you can barely tell if it’s day or night through the blizzard. Fitzgerald, Anderson, Bridger, Murphy and Stubby Joe trudge through the storm in their snowshoes...  finally reach the bunkhouse.
INT. BUNKHOUSE - EVENING
Anderson shoves the door closed against the wind...  latches it. The men look worn and battered...  wind-burnt faces, icicles in their beards.
71.
ANDERSON
I just about had my fill of this
cold as hell place.
FITZGERALD
I keep tellin' ya there's plenty a money to be made in warmer climates.
MURPHY
We're contracted for twelve months.
Henry puts us where he pleases.
FITZGERALD
While he squats his ass on his toasty warm stove. Whatta you reckon he'd do if he showed up one day and found this place empty? Sure wouldn't come after us. Not til spring at least.
BRIDGER
We gave him our word...  to honor a promise. That counts for somethin'. To some folks anyway.
It's clear Bridger is talking straight to Fitzgerald. And Fitzgerald throws Bridger a glare...  wants to throw more, but Bridger’s returning the stare...  hard...  so Fitzgerald decides he’d better not push it.
FITZGERALD
You hadn't lived long enough to
preach to me, boy.	Come to me
after life's spit in your face... 
took away all you ever had.	Then
I'll let you cry honor from your
pulpit.
The bunkhouse goes silent. Fitzgerald turns his look on the others.
FITZGERALD (cont'd)
What about the rest of ya?
The others trade glances...  no takers.
FITZGERALD (cont'd)
Rather keep slavin' it for Henry,
huh?	Least we should push to up
our pay.
Still nothing.
72.
FITZGERALD (cont'd)
Jesus.	Not much backbone in this
bunk.
STUBBY BILL
No stoppin' you from goin', Fitz.
That's a challenge. And Fitzgerald never backs down from one of those. He grabs his gloves...  starts strapping his snowshoes back on.
FITZGERALD
It'll only be on my interests I
argue for.
Fitzgerald walks out...  leaves the door wide open for the cold wind to pour over the others. Anderson scurries over, shoving it closed.
INT. ROCKY MOUNTAIN FUR COMPANY OFFICE - DAY
Fitzgerald enters...  sees Henry working at his desk.
FITZGERALD
I need to talk to you, Captain.
HENRY
(without looking up)
What is it this time, Fitzgerald?
But Fitzgerald doesn't answer...  not right off, because he just spotted the SAFE DOOR CRACKED OPEN behind Henry...  STACKS OF MONEY visible inside.
Henry looks up at Fitzgerald...  snapping Fitzgerald's focus back.
FITZGERALD
Wanted to ask about my contract.
Henry stands up...  carries the papers to the door.
HENRY
Can this wait?	I've got business
to tend to.
FITZGERALD
Yes sir, Captain.
Henry walks out...  as Fitzgerald's eyes drift back to that safe.
73.
EXT. WILDERNESS - EVENING
Glass crouches beside a stream, cupping handfuls of water to his lips. He HEARS O.S. MOVEMENT...  looks up... 
... to Spotted Horse just across the stream...  sitting on his horse, holding a spear, and wearing Glass' Grizzly Claw Necklace. And he's leading a PAINT MARE behind him, loaded with a BEAR HIDE COAT.
SPOTTED HORSE
Need horse ride to Yoon-yun.
EXT. WILDERNESS/CAMP - NIGHT
Tucked under the rooftop of trees. Glass and Spotted Horse are crouched beside a fire-bed...  no flames...  no smoke...  just warmth. Glass is wearing the Bear Hide.
Spotted Horse pulls off his own BEADED CHESTPLATE...  holds it out to Glass.
GLASS
You've already done plenty for me.
SPOTTED HORSE
Bring luck in hunt.
Glass nods...  takes the chestplate, slipping it on.
GLASS
Thank you.
SPOTTED HORSE
Spend life hunting enemy.	Enemy
win.
GLASS
It will be over soon.
Glass and Spotted Horse hold a look. Then Spotted Horse looks to the Grizzly Claw.
SPOTTED HORSE
Was big griz-lee?
GLASS
Yes.
Spotted Horse smiles. And that's when the ARROW BURSTS THROUGH THE FRONT OF HIS CHEST... 
74.
... and Glass looks up...  sees SEVERAL DARK SHAPES RUSHING THROUGH THE TREES TOWARD THEM.
Spotted Horse reaches for Glass...  crumbles over, just as there's an O.S. SNAP BEHIND GLASS.
Glass spins in time to see an ARIKARA WARRIOR SWINGING A HATCHET.
Glass dives, scooping up Spotted Horse's spear...  driving it into the air, shoving it through the Warrior's stomach.
The dark woods suddenly ERUPT IN WAR CRIES...  Arikara appear from all sides.
Glass tears the knife from Spotted Horse's sheath...  scrambles up...  races toward the Paint Mare as ARROWS PIERCE THE AIR ALL AROUND HIM.
Glass swings up onto the Paint Mare...  spots ELK’S TONGUE leading the charge...  the necklace of ears hanging around his neck. And Elk’s Tongue’s eyes are locked on Glass...  almost like he remembers him.
EXT. FOREST - NIGHT
Glass hanging onto the paint mare, as she gallops through the trees...  the animal’s nostrils spread wide, pulling in all the oxygen it can.
Glass glances back...  sees SHAPES BEHIND HIM...  HORSES... 
ridden by Elk’s Tongue and a DOZEN OTHER WARRIORS.
Glass digs his heels into the horse, squeezing every ounce of speed from her legs...  pushing her toward the clearing up ahead...  throwing another glance back...  then looking in front of him, and realizing it isn’t a clearing at all... 
... it’s the edge of the world.
The paint mare explodes from the trees, then runs out of ground...  because she’s just galloped off the side of a cliff.
The horse sails downward toward a thick forest of trees, its legs flailing for something to stand on.
Glass grips the horse’s mane, hanging on for what seems an endless fall.
75.
The mare SLAMS LEG-FIRST INTO THE TREE-TOPS with Glass still on her back. The Paint Mare SQUEALS as she smashes through the snow-covered trees, carrying Glass with her.
CUT TO:
EXT. FOREST - CONTINUOUS
And the horse comes crashing through the branches...  the massive limbs slowing her fall...  snapping off as her body hits and twists...  tosses Glass away.
Glass sails through the air...  hits a slope, and tumbles down into a stream of icy water... 
... sinks below the surface a moment...  long enough that we're sure he has to be dead...  until he rises from the water...  drags himself up to the snowy ground...  collapses...  shivering...  staring up through the trees... 
... to Elk’s Tongue and his Warriors peering down from the top of the cliff...  with no way to get to Glass. Finally, they turn...  disappear.
EXT. WOODS - NIGHT
Glass moves shivering through the trees...  his body soaked...  clothes beginning to ice over...  body convulsing from the cold... 
... when he finds the DEAD PAINT MARE twisted on the forest floor.
Glass grabs the loose blanket from the snow...  shakily wraps it around himself. But it's worthless in this frigid night air. Glass is going to freeze to death.
He stares at the dead horse a beat, then pulls the knife back, and SLAMS IT INTO THE HORSE’S STOMACH...  begins slicing the mare’s belly open. His hands shake so much he can barely control the knife.
Blood and organs spill out, staining the snow. Steam rises from the remains. Glass keeps on cutting...  turning his head from the smell, as he pulls out whatever doesn’t ooze out on its own...  emptying the carcass.
Glass peels off his wet furs, then does what we didn’t think was possible...  he begins crawling feet-first into the horse’s hollow belly...  holding its ribs up so he can slip inside...  curling up...  SQUISHING IN...  deeper...  deeper...  until only his head remains outside of the horse.
76.
Glass wraps the blanket around his face and head...  doing everything he can to survive.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. WILDERNESS - MORNING
The dead horse...  its fur white and icy...  Glass’ blanket-wrapped head still protruding from the seam in its stomach. And nothing’s moving...  the whole world looks frozen stiff... 
... until Glass’ head shifts...  the CRACKING OF FROZEN FLESH, as he lifts the upper half of the mare's belly. It’s like a cocoon tearing open. He rolls out of the carcass, hitting the ground, and squinting up into the warmth of the sun.
The horse’s blood covers his clothes. He slides the frozen fur back over himself, then gazes up at the sun for direction...  starts walking. Alone...  in the middle of nowhere...  again.
EXT. OPEN COUNTRY - DAY
From high above...  the small shape of Glass making his way across the snowy ground...  heading toward TWO DISTANT SHACKS.
EXT. FORT TALBOT - DAY
A makeshift town on the banks of the Missouri. Two ramshackle structures...  the General Store and a tattered livery stable.
INT. FORT TALBOT/GENERAL STORE - DAY
More like a saloon that sells a few supplies. A gang of TRAPPERS drink and play cards. A RUNTY MAN stands behind the counter, watching them... 
... until the door blows open, and in steps Glass. The men stop what they're doing...  watch him limp silently to the wood stove...  pants stained with the mare’s blood...  ice frozen in his beard.
TRAPPER #1 SNORTS A LAUGH. The Runty Man eyes the SIOUX CHESTPLATE, as Glass warms his hands...  his face. Finally... 
GLASS
I need a horse.
77.
RUNTY MAN
I don't serve injuns or those
that's partial to injuns.
GLASS
(struggling to make his
frozen lips move)
I’m Hugh Glass of... 
RUNTY MAN
I don’t serve injuns or those
that's partial to injuns.
Glass stares at the Runty Man a beat, then... 
GLASS
... of the Rocky Mountain Fur
Company on my way to Fort Union.
RUNTY MAN
I don’t care if you was with Lewis and Clark headed for the new world. I've lost too many folks to them savages.
(off the chestplate)
A fella wears that is too native
friendly for my taste.
GLASS
All I need is a horse and enough
supplies to get me... 
TRAPPER
Ice musta froze up his ears, ‘cause he ain’t listenin’ to you, Cees.
GLASS
... to get me to Fort Union. I can
sign a draft made good by Captain
Henry.
The Runty Man just stares at Glass...  grins a TOOTHLESS GRIN.
RUNTY MAN
You're a stubborn one, ain't ya? I tell ya what...  what I will do is let you trade me that fancy injun jewelry for a warm glass of piss.
TRAPPER #2
I can give him some fresh.
FAT TRAPPER
Best get on your way, friend.
78.
Glass stares back at the men for a long beat, then... 
GLASS
I’m Hugh Glass of the Rocky
Mountain Fur Company, and all I
need is... 
RUNTY MAN
(to the trappers)
Do you believe this shit?
Trapper #1 and Trapper #2 pull the SKINNING KNIVES from their belts...  start toward Glass.
TRAPPER #1
He don't wanna make the trade, what say we just cut it off him?
FAT TRAPPER
Hell, I warned ya.
GLASS
All I need... 
And that’s when Trapper #1 grabs for Glass and the chestplate, but in a flash of movement that catches them all off-guard, Glass has is own knife pulled and JAMMED UNDER TRAPPER #1’s CHIN. Everyone freezes.
GLASS (cont’d)
... is a horse and enough supplies
to get me to Fort Union.
Then Glass slides Trapper #1’s PISTOL from his belt...  aims it at the other men.
GLASS (cont’d)
And this shooter here. All made good by Captain Henry and The Rocky Mountain Fur Company.
EXT. FORT TALBOT - DAY
The snow pours down on the Runty Man and the trappers, as they stand outside, rifles aimed into the distance.
RUNTY MAN
Shoot him, goddammit!
TRAPPER #2
I can’t get a clear look.
79.
RUNTY MAN
Shoot ‘em both!
The Runty Man snatches one of the rifles...  BOOM...  fires a wild shot past the riders.
CUT TO:
GLASS - GALLOPING AWAY ON HORSEBACK... 
... with Trapper #1 sitting backward on the horse behind him. Glass has the pistol jammed into his ribs, and keeps glancing back to the men growing smaller behind him.
Finally, Glass shoves the man off the back of the horse.
Trapper #1 tumbles into the snow.
The RUMBLE OF DISTANT GUNSHOTS...  too far away to reach Glass, who just keeps racing north.
CUT TO:
THE RUNTY MAN - WATCHING GLASS ESCAPE.
RUNTY MAN
Get after the bastard!
The trappers exchange glances...  don’t move.
TRAPPER #2
It’s cold as hell, Cees.
FAT TRAPPER
And he did say to put it all on the
Rocky Mountain tab.
The Runty Man glares at the trappers.
EXT. OPEN COUNTRY - EVENING
Glass riding the horse at a trot through the snow.
EXT. FORT UNION - NIGHT
Thick with fog, and silent as death. The moon fights its way through the mist, sending an eerie glow over the fort.
80.
EXT. FORT UNION/BLOCKHOUSE - NIGHT
Stubby Bill sits dozing in a chair, his rifle across his lap.
O.S. CRUNCHING...  getting louder...  loud enough to nudge
Stubby Bill awake.
He sits up...  peers over the wall, but can’t see anything in the fog...  just hears the CRUNCHING MOVING CLOSER...  FOOTSTEPS IN THE CRISP SNOW.
CUT TO:
STUBBY BILL’S POV... 
... on the blanket of fog hanging in the air...  that same CRUNCHING, as a SHADOW APPEARS...  growing clearer...  a FIGURE walking...  leading a horse behind him...  appearing out of the mist like a ghost...  GLASS.
STUBBY BILL - STARES DOWN IN SHOCK... 
... sure his eyes are betraying him. But then Glass looks straight up at Stubby Bill, and there’s no doubt.
STUBBY BILL
Jesus Christ.
INT. BUNKHOUSE - NIGHT
Dark and quiet...  just snoring rattling the silence. Suddenly the door kicks open...  SLAMS into the wall...  and there’s GLASS’ SILHOUETTE FILLING THE DOORWAY, HOLDING THAT STOLEN PISTOL AT HIS SIDE.
GROANS from the awakened men...  hands moving through the dark for oil lamps...  turning them bright...  until the room’s fully lit...  and they all see Glass standing there...  eyes floating across the room, searching for a target.
The men just stare back at him, like they’re all part of the same dream.
Except for Bridger, who’s propped up in his cot like he’s been waiting all night...  waiting every night...  for Glass to appear in that doorway.
BRIDGER
I’m sorry.
The other men just watch in silence, not sure what the hell’s going on.
81.
Glass holds his stare on Bridger’s face...  a face that’s haunted him...  kept him alive.
GLASS
You took everything I had...  left
me to die.
Glass walks toward Bridger...  each step of his feet on the wood floor is like the thud of an executioner’s drum.
MUMBLING from the other men, as they watch this ghost reach Bridger...  stand over him.
BRIDGER
I was scared of dyin’.
(beat)
But every day since, I’ve wished I had.
GLASS
There wasn’t no ‘Ree that night,
was there?
A long beat, then... 
BRIDGER
No.
Glass flinches...  almost like he didn't want that to be true.
BRIDGER (cont'd)
But I didn't know that til later.
I swear to God I didn't.
Bridger's face suddenly looks very young...  just a boy’s...  a scared boy...  not the face Glass had pictured in his mind for so long. And suddenly Glass seems almost ashamed...  sad even.
GLASS
He killed Pig.
BRIDGER
Huh?
GLASS
Fitzgerald.	I watched him.	Now
where is he?
HENRY (O.S.)
Deserted two days ago.
Henry’s hustling in the door with Stubby Bill, still throwing on his coat after Stubby Bill awakened him.
82.
HENRY (cont’d)
Along with about a thousand dollars of company money.
Glass doesn't even look back to Henry.
GLASS
My rifle?
HENRY
Took it too.
Glass considers that a moment, then walks out.
BRIDGER
Wait.	Please!
But Glass is gone, with Henry following...  leaving Bridger alone with all those eyes burning into him.
The men step into their boots and furs...  file out after Glass and Henry...  leave Bridger alone in the bunkhouse.
INT. ROCKY MOUNTAIN FUR COMPANY OFFICE - NIGHT
Glass sits by the warmth of the stove, sipping coffee.
Henry’s behind he desk, with the other men scattered around.
GLASS
Spent the night inside that mare,
then hiked over to Fort Talbot.
STUBBY BILL
Christ almighty.
GLASS
And you may hear from the fella
there about a stoled horse and
supplies charged to you.
HENRY
We’ll take care of it. You should go settle in.
MURPHY
There’s a couple fair whores next door that’ll ease the miles on ya, scars or not.
Stubby Bill gives Murphy an elbow.
ANDERSON
Jesus, Murph.
83.
MURPHY
I just meant I’d go roust one of
‘em for him if he wanted.
GLASS
(shakes his head)
But I wouldn’t mind the use of her bed.
HENRY
(to Murphy)
Go clear out a room. The rest head on back to bunk.
Murphy hustles out. The others move toward the door, each stopping to shake Glass’ hand, or give him a pat on the back, until it's only Glass and Henry.
HENRY (cont’d)
What do I do about Bridger?
GLASS
Fitzgerald woke us both with a story about ‘Ree comin’ into camp. Any of us woulda done the same.
HENRY
Not lied about your condition.
GLASS
I doubt Fitzgerald gave him much
choice.	I'll find him and deal
with that.
A beat of silence, until... 
HENRY
Can I talk you outta what you’re
planning to do?
Glass doesn’t answer...  just stands, placing the coffee cup on the table.
GLASS
Thank you for what you done for
me...  stitchin’ me back together... 
tryin' to give me a chance.
HENRY
I’m offerin’ you another right
now...  to stay here...  let this
thing go.	We'll send some others
out after Fitzgerald.
84.
GLASS
(beat)
There was nothin' strong in me for not dyin' those first days. I was ready for you to pull the trigger...  even hopin' for it. Been wantin' it as long as I can remember.
(shakes his head)
But now...  I can't let him have what he took from me...  it's all I got left of... 
Emotion won't let Glass finish.	He turns toward the door.
GLASS (cont'd)
I appreciate the coffee.
Glass walks out.	Henry just sits there.
EXT. FORT UNION - DAY
Glass, Anderson, and Murphy stand by Glass’ horse, as he ties off his supplies.
MURPHY
Fitzgerald said he was goin’ to look for some elk...  never showed back up. I figured he mighta fell in, but then the next mornin' Bridger seen the canoe was missin’.
ANDERSON
And the Captain found the money gone. Pieces all fit for it to be Fitzgerald.
GLASS
I’ll start off makin' my way down
river.
Glass pulls the cinch tight around the horse...  turns...  sees Bridger standing across the grounds...  watching him. And then Bridger approaches.
MURPHY
You want me to run him off?
Glass shakes his head...  finishes with the saddle. Bridger reaches them...  waits for Glass to turn, then... 
85.
BRIDGER
Every day I think about what I done to you. And every day I wanted to tell the others the truth, but I was afraid of what they'd think of me. Then I'd look at Fitzgerald and want to kill him but was afraid to try...  because I'm a coward.
(beat)
I'm coward and wish he hadn’t been lyin about the Ree that night. I wish they had come and kilt us both.
Glass considers Bridger's words.
GLASS
You're not a coward, Bridger, you're a boy. No older than mine should be. And you put yourself at risk to stay back and look after me. There's nothin' coward about that.
Glass extends his hand to Bridger. Bridger stares at it a moment, still too ashamed to take it. But finally he does.
BRIDGER
I wanna come with you.	To find
Fitzgerald.	Pig was my friend too.
GLASS
(shakes his head)
This ain't a job for you.
Glass swings up into the saddle...  sees Henry on horseback, trotting toward them.
GLASS (cont’d)
I don't need help with this.
HENRY
I know you don't.	But Pig was my
responsibility.	If Fitzgerald
murdered him, Rocky Mountain Fur
wants him too.
Glass stares at Henry a beat...  knows what's going on, and also knows he can't do anything about it. So he just pulls his horse around...  heads for the river. Henry nods to the others, then follows after Glass.
Bridger takes a few steps after them...  like he might even follow on foot.
86.
ANDERSON
C'mon, Jim, let's go eat somethin'.
Anderson gives Bridger a pat on the back...  a sign that all will be fine between them. They turn...  walk back toward the bunkhouse.
EXT. FORT TALBOT/GENERAL STORE - DAY
The Runty Man behind the counter. A few of the same Trappers drinking...  playing cards. Just another day at Fort Talbot.
The door swings open, and a FUR-COVERED FIGURE enters.
RUNTY MAN
We ain’t got no food to spare,
friend, if that’s what you’re
lookin’ for.
The figure pulls back his furs, and we see it’s Fitzgerald... 
cold and miserable.
FITZGERALD
Then what the hell have ya got?
RUNTY MAN
Whiskey and blankets mostly.
Weather’s held back deliveries.
Fitzgerald throws a glance to the Trappers.
FITZGERALD
Gimme a few of each then. Goddamn ice shredded my boat to shit. Been walkin’ for two days.
The Runty Man hands Fitzgerald some bottles. Fitzgerald pops one...  gulps some down.
FITZGERALD (cont’d)
How much for one of them horses out there?
RUNTY MAN
Horses ain’t cheap this time a
year.
FITZGERALD
Whatever the price, Rocky Mountain
Fur Company’s good for it.
And those words stop everything. The Trappers all turn from their game. The Runty Man glares at Fitzgerald.
87.
RUNTY MAN
You’re the second son of a bitch come in here makin’ that claim. And the first one left a bad taste.
FITZGERALD
I don’t know nothin’ about that.
Just that I need a horse.
RUNTY MAN
So did this other fella...  to head up to Union. So he stole one...  along with Lange’s pistola.
Trapper #1 nods to Fitzgerald...  this doesn't look good.
FITZGERALD
Fine then, I’ll pay cash for the
horse.	How much?
RUNTY MAN
How ‘bout you pay for your friend’s too.
TRAPPER #1
And my shooter.
FITZGERALD
Wasn’t my friend.
TRAPPER #1
Then from where I sit, you don’t
got no friends at all.
The other Trappers glare at Fitzgerald. The Runty Man just grins that toothless smile of his. Fitzgerald’s in a bind, and he knows it.
FITZGERALD
Yeah, okay.	I’ll collect from him.
How much?
RUNTY MAN
How ‘bout we say eighty... 
(sees Fitzgerald doesn’t
argue)
... five.
Fitzgerald starts digging into his pocket.
FITZGERALD
You boys are leavin’ me with
nothin’.	Better be a helluva
horse.
88.
RUNTY MAN
Pick of the litter.
The Runty Man snatches the cash.
RUNTY MAN (cont’d) And when you see that scarred-up bastard, you tell him he’d best not show up here again.
Fitzgerald freezes...  not sure he heard correctly.
FITZGERALD
When I see who?
RUNTY MAN
The son of a bitch that robbed me. Hugh Glass he called hisself. You tell him that.
And Fitzgerald looks like he just saw a ghost...  or at least heard his name.
FITZGERALD
You're a goddamn liar.
RUNTY MAN
(suddenly pissed)
How's that, mister?
FITZGERALD
Ain't no way Glass come through
here.
RUNTY MAN
Then it was some other scarred-up
son of a bitch claimed to be him.
TRAPPER #1
Right before he drug me off on
Cees' gelding.
Fitzgerald is confused...  nervous...  maybe even scared.
RUNTY MAN
What makes you so sure it weren't
him?
As Fitzgerald turns for the door... 
FITZGERALD
'Cause I killed him.
89.
EXT. FORT TALBOT - DAY
Fitzgerald sits on the horse, staring back over the ground... 
his LINE OF TRACKS LEADING THROUGH THE SNOW. Glass will track him...  that is a fact.
So Fitzgerald spins...  takes off. Glass will have to catch him first.
EXT. WILDERNESS - DAY
Open country. No cover to hide anywhere. Fitzgerald is off his horse...  leading it up an icy slope.
And then DISTANT GUNSHOTS...  SCREAMS...  echoing around him.
Fitzgerald peers back into the distance...  no way to see where it's coming from, but those SCREAMS are definitely real.
And for the first time, Fitzgerald looks truly frightened... 
as if those screams have haunted him for years.
His eyes dance around...  he spins...  searching for an attacker...  but he's all alone.
So he hurries up the slope...  swings onto the horse, and digs his heels into the horse's ribs...  gallops over the snow.
EXT. MISSOURI RIVER - DAY
Thick ice along the edges, tapering to a narrow stream of flowing water at the very center. Glass and Henry ride along the snow-covered bank.
HENRY
Hugh.
Henry points. Glass follows his finger along the river...  to a CANOE resting on the bank ahead. They dismount...  examine the canoe...  the letters “RMFC” painted on the side.
HENRY (cont'd)
That’s it.
Glass runs his mittened hand along the gashes in the wood.
GLASS
Ice tore it up.
Glass looks to the FOOTPRINTS IN THE SNOW, leading deep into the trees. He glances up to the sky...  clear and blue.
90.
GLASS (cont’d)
If the snow holds off, we’ll have a good trail.
HENRY
What’s out that direction?	Talbot?
GLASS
And the Missouri.	Doubt he’d risk
the river with the ‘Ree.	Likely
grab a horse, and cross over
high...  take his chances goin’ east
against the weather.	When’d you
say he skipped out?
HENRY
Three days ago now.
GLASS
We best pick up our pace.
They climb back onto their horses...  trot into the trees.
EXT. OPEN COUNTRY - DAY
Glass and Henry gallop across, their path dead on Fitzgerald’s tracks.
EXT. FORT TALBOT - DAY
At least what was Fort Talbot...  now just charred, smoldering, wooden skeletons...  burned to the ground.
And the scalped, one-eared corpses of the Runty Man and Trappers are strung up on posts like gruesome scarecrows...  a few brave birds pecking at the flesh.
Glass and Henry sit on their horses, looking at the scene... 
the tracks heading south.
HENRY
The 'Ree'll find him. Let them do the job, Hugh.
Glass just turns his horse...  starts along the tracks. And he's moving fast.
HENRY (cont'd)
Hugh!
But Glass doesn't slow. He has to get to Fitzgerald before Elk's Tongue. Henry takes off after him.
91.
EXT. WOODS - NIGHT
Dark and quiet. Fitzgerald sleeps on the ground. A shadow glides across him...  hovers over his face. Fitzgerald’s eyes blink open.
CUT TO:
FITZGERALD’S POV... 
... on GLASS STANDING OVER HIM...  his scarred face calm and deadly...  raising a knife to drive down.
FITZGERALD
No...  please.
But Glass still swings the blade.
CUT TO:
EXT. WOODS - NIGHT
And Fitzgerald awakening from his nightmare...  looking around the empty forest. No Glass.
Fitzgerald's face is drawn...  exhausted...  like Glass is torturing him...  won't let him sleep. So he stands...  starts gathering his gear.
EXT. WILDERNESS - NIGHT
Fitzgerald on his horse...  riding through the snow. But now he's riding the opposite direction...  following his own tracks back the way he came.
He's going to find Glass before Glass finds him.
EXT. WILDERNESS/CAMP - NIGHT
Glass builds a fire-bed...  dragging the dirt over the fire and rocks...  spreading a blanket over the warm ground. Henry’s under a blanket, watching him.
HENRY
You told me once you knew enough to keep away from the ‘Ree.
GLASS
I do.
92.
HENRY
Doesn't seem like it.
(beat)
What if we find Fitzgerald...  and I ask you not to do this?
Glass settles onto the warm earth.
GLASS
Don’t ask me.
EXT. WILDERNESS/CAMP - LATER
ANGLE ON HENRY... 
... asleep under the blanket. O.S. RUSTLING sends his eyes flashing open. He raises up...  rifle ready.
He glances at Glass, who puts a finger over his lips.
HENRY
(whispers)
‘Ree?
Glass doesn’t answer...  just keeps searching the brush.
Henry’s groggy eyes dart around the night...  spots MOVEMENT IN THE BRUSH.
HENRY (cont’d)
There!
GLASS
Wait!
But it’s too late...  Henry fires...  BOOM...  the shot explodes through the night... 
... and the DEER leaps away.
Henry looks to Glass...  shakes his head...  sorry.
HENRY
So much for stayin’ quiet.
GLASS
We needed to pick up some time
anyways.
Glass stands...  starts packing up his horse.
93.
EXT. WILDERNESS/CLEARING - NIGHT
Glass and Henry riding across a meadow. Glass stops...  tilts his head back to sniff the air.
HENRY
Whatta ya got?
GLASS
Smoke.
Glass pulls some snow from his horse’s mane...  tosses it in the air, and watches it blow to the side.
Glass turns his horse toward the breeze...  squints out into the night.
GLASS (cont’d)
No more than mile out that way.
(pulls his rifle)
I’ll head in from the west...  you
take the east.
HENRY
What if it’s ‘Ree?
GLASS
Then we leave ‘em be...  meet back
up here.
Henry nods...  Glass takes off at a trot. Henry veers the other direction...  splitting up across the snow.
EXT. FOREST - NIGHT
Splinters of moonlight shoot through the pines. Glass on horseback, walking through the trees...  appearing and disappearing.
He spots something in the distance...  the slightest of glows.
Glass eases off his horse...  wraps the reins around a branch.
EXT. WILDERNESS - NIGHT
Henry’s already off his horse...  leading it through the trees...  searching as he walks.
94.
EXT. FOREST - NIGHT
Glass moves silently through the darkness...  rifle poised to aim and fire...  just like the first time we saw him, perfectly comfortable in this world.
His eyes shine in the darkness, drifting back and forth... 
picking up everything.
He reaches the glow...  the remains of a campfire. The slightest bit of dying smoke rises into the air. Glass crouches down, studying the surround ground...  HOOF-PRINTS blended in with the other tracks.
EXT. WILDERNESS - NIGHT
Henry’s horse is making too much noise with each step. He stops walking...  wraps the reins around a tree...  walks back around the horse... 
... AND THERE’S FITZGERALD STARING AT HIM...  Glass’ Anstadt aimed and ready to fire.
FITZGERALD
Didn’t figure an important man like yourself to be away from your stove on a night as cold as this, Captain. You lost?
Henry just stares back at Fitzgerald and that rifle. His eyes drift to his own rifle, still strapped onto his saddle.
HENRY
I’m here to save your life.
FITZGERALD
Is that right? Well I done told you boys...  I don’t need savin’ by nobody.
Henry knows he’s only got one chance...  he makes a grab for the rifle.
EXT. FOREST - NIGHT
Glass running his fingers across the tracks. Suddenly an O.S. GUNSHOT EXPLODES IN THE DISTANCE. Glass spins to it...  races back through the trees toward his horse.
95.
EXT. FOREST - NIGHT
Glass at full gallop through the woods...  veering between trees...  ducking branches.
EXT. WILDERNESS - NIGHT
Glass charges from the forest...  spots Henry’s horse standing in the trees...  tears through the snow toward it...  leaps off the still-moving animal in a fluid slide...  hits the ground with his rifle ready... 
... and sees HENRY’S BODY face-up in the snow.
Glass drops to a knee...  scans the darkness, as he slides over to Henry... 
... and we see he’s a bloody mess...  a GUNSHOT WOUND in his chest leaking out onto the snow...  HIS HEAD SCALPED...  LEFT EAR SLICED OFF.
GLASS
You shouldn’t a come.
As Glass looks at Henry, he notices something...  takes Henry by the chin, and tilts his head. And HENRY’S RIGHT EAR HAS BEEN CUT OFF AS WELL.
SPOTTED HORSE (V.O.)
He say Arikara take right ear of
Sioux.	Left ear of whites.
Glass looks up from Henry's corpse...  squints out into the forest.
EXT. WILDERNESS/CLEARING - NIGHT
Glass on horseback, leading Henry’s horse behind him across the snow-covered meadow. Henry’s fur-covered body is draped over the saddle.
EXT. FROZEN RIVER - NIGHT
A thick layer of ice covers the narrow river, thinning just a bit at the center. Glass kneels near the middle, chopping at the thick ice to get to the water beneath. He makes a hole...  dips his canteen down into it, glancing around into the darkness.
Then Glass turns...  stares up a slope into the dark forest beyond...  like he knows what’s waiting for him there.
96.
He walks to the horses, tied in the trees at the base of the slope...  Henry still laying across the saddle of his horse in his bloody furs.
Glass SNAPS A BRANCH FROM A FALLEN TREE...  looks back up that slope.
EXT. WILDERNESS - NIGHT
OUR POV FROM DEEP IN THE FOREST... 
... watching from a low angle in the shadowy brush, as Glass appears up over the distant slope...  riding through the trees, with Henry draped over the horse behind.
The forest is quiet...  just the CRACKING of crusty snow and branches under the horses’ hooves.
Then BOOM...  as the ANSTADT BARREL WE HADN’T SEEN BESIDE US FLASHES IN THE NIGHT... 
... and Glass tumbles off his horse.
The horses prance around nervously, then settle...  and then FITZGERALD RISES FROM THE BRUSH BESIDE US...  eases toward the horses, reloading the Anstadt as he moves.
He reaches Glass, face down in the snow...  his furs covering him.
And Fitzgerald has that rifle aimed, ready for Glass to suddenly roll over firing... 
... but Glass doesn’t move. Fitzgerald nudges him with his boot, then rolls him over... 
... and instead of Glass, we see HENRY’S LIFELESS FACE HIDDEN BENEATH THE FURS...  and that BROKEN BRANCH sticking up along his back.
ANGLE FROM BEHIND HENRY’S HORSE... 
... on the REST OF THE BRANCH RIGGED TO GLASS’ SADDLE to hold Henry upright... 
... and then what we thought was Henry flung over the second horse...  MOVING...  the bloody fur-covered arm lifting a rifle...  the head rising up...  it’s GLASS...  taking aim... 
... as Fitzgerald realizes what’s happened...  spins with the Anstadt... 
97.
... to Glass laying across the horse...  rifle dead set on Fitzgerald...  BOOM...  BOOM...  both rifles explode... 
... Fitzgerald goes flying backward into the brush.
Fitzgerald’s wild shot hits Henry’s horse, sending it rearing up, tossing Glass to the ground.
But Glass is on his feet in a flash...  reloading as he charges into the brush... 
... but FITZGERALD IS GONE.
Until the flash of movement behind Glass...  he turns...  as the butt of the Anstadt whips through the air...  WHACK... 
clubs him across the head, sending him tumbling down the slope to the frozen river.
Fitzgerald swings the Anstadt back over his BLOODY SHOULDER, snatches up his knife, and charges down the slope to finish Glass off.
EXT. FROZEN RIVER - NIGHT
Glass lies on the ice, barely conscious. Blood oozes down his head...  over his eyes. He wipes it away to see Fitzgerald barreling down toward him.
Fitzgerald dives in attack, but Glass kicks up his leg, sending Fitzgerald flying over...  SLAMMING into the frozen river, his head CRACKING THE ICE.
Glass rips the knife from his belt...  moves after Fitzgerald, his feet slipping and sliding under him.
Fitzgerald rises to his feet...  the men charge like two wild animals...  crash into each other...  knives flailing.
They roll along the ice, blades glistening...  slicing through furs...  across flesh...  this battle is just as violent as Glass' bout with that Grizzly.
Fitzgerald thrusts his knife down...  plants it through the back of Glass’ hand, pinning it to the ice. Glass CRIES OUT...  drops his own knife to pull Fitzgerald’s out.
As he does, Fitzgerald kicks Glass in the face, sending him sailing back...  sliding to the center of the river.
The thin ice around him splinters...  cracks. Glass looks up...  sees Fitzgerald stalking toward him, HOLDING BOTH KNIVES now. Glass is trapped... 
98.
... until he pounds his elbow down on the weakened ice...  it begins to give...  he pounds it again...  Fitzgerald speeds up to get to Glass in time...  raises one of the knives...  just as Glass shatters the ice...  drops beneath the surface.
Fitzgerald rushes after him, but the ice cracks under his feet, forcing him back.
CUT TO:
UNDERWATER... 
... and Glass just below the ice, floating with the current.
His fingers search for a hole, but there’s nothing.
CUT TO:
CUT TO:
FITZGERALD... 
... making his way down the river, peering through the ice, searching for Glass. He spots something...  stops...  leans close to make out the shape...  it’s GLASS’ FEET.
Then suddenly, GLASS’ FIST EXPLODES THROUGH THE ICE AT FITZGERALD’S FEET...  grab Fitzgerald’s leg, pulling him down.
Fitzgerald crashes to the ice...  it splinters around him...  gives away, and he sinks into the icy water...  but the ANSTADT STRAPPED AROUND HIM CATCHES ON THE ICE...  holds him against the current.
Glass drags himself from the water...  stands...  stares down at Fitzgerald trapped in the hole...  his face looking up at Glass through the ice. Glass lifts one of the fallen knives...  stands over Fitzgerald.
FITZGERALD
(through the water and
ice)
Help me!
(off Glass’ stare)
Glass...  please!
Glass hesitates a beat, staring at him, just as he did with Bridger that night in the bunkhouse. And then Glass leans down...  grabs the Anstadt to pull Fitzgerald up.
Except Glass SLICES THE BLADE ACROSS THE STRAP OF THE ANSTADT... 
99.
... sends Fitzgerald floating away under the ice, as Glass holds on to the Anstadt.
CUT TO:
FITZGERALD... 
... careening under the surface...  pounding at the ice as he drifts, until his swinging slows...  stops...  his dead body drifts away.
EXT. FROZEN RIVER - NIGHT
Glass stands on the ice, blood dripping down his face, holding his Anstadt. He begins to tremble...  not from the cold, but from finally reaching the end of this journey. He looks at the rifle, and his eyes begin to fill with tears.
Then a NOISE from across the river... 
... and Glass looks up...  sees ELK’S TONGUE standing on the opposite side of the river, staring back at Glass.
And Jesus, we thought Glass might make it through this...  but then shapes appear on each side of Elk's Tongue...  a DOZEN ARIKARA WARRIORS...  all ready for a massacre.
Glass and Elk’s Tongue exchange a long stare, until finally Glass SCREAMS OUT.
GLASS
I am Mato Wicasa!	I have killed
whites and I have killed Arikara
and I have killed grizzly!	AND I
WILL KILL YOU!
Elk’s Tongue doesn’t move...  just stares back at Glass...  soaked in blood and water. Then Glass CRIES OUT at the warriors again.
GLASS (cont’d)
COME ON!
But the Arikara don’t attack...  don’t move at all...  until Elk’s Tongue finally just gives Glass the SLIGHTEST OF NODS, then turns...  they disappear back into the trees.
Glass watches the Arikara fade into the night. He looks down to that Anstadt in his hand...  the CARVED STAR...  he allows the faintest of smiles... 
100.
... then Glass' legs weaken...  he drops to his knees on the ice. He looks down...  spots the MATTED BLOOD on his furs... 
isn't sure whose blood it is. Then he pulls the furs back from his stomach...  reveals the LARGE CRIMSON STAIN SPREADING OVER HIS SHIRT.
It's Glass' blood, and there's a lot of it.
Glass eases back, until he's just sitting there on the icy river, staring across into the trees.
The world seems suddenly peaceful...  like Glass has it all to himself...  until O.S. FOOTSTEPS CRUNCHING in the forest behind Glass. He doesn't turn toward it.
CUT TO:
POV FROM THE WOODS BEHIND GLASS... 
... slowly moving through the trees...  easing toward Glass, still on the river.
GLASS - Sitting there with his rifle...  hearing the FOOTSTEPS, but he's too weak to move...  too weak to fight anymore.
The FOOTSTEPS ARE CLOSE...  RIGHT ON US...  a FIGURE'S SHADOW moves over Glass. Glass just keeps staring straight ahead.
And then the Figure sits down beside Glass, and we see it's a BOY...  THE BOY FROM THE BED...  GLASS' SON.
Glass looks at the Boy...  smiles.
The Boy returns the smile, then reaches down...  runs his small hand over the rifle.
ANGLE ON THE ANSTADT... 
... and the small hand running its finger along the outline of that carved-out star. And then Glass' hand dropping into the frame...  taking the small hand, and holding it.
CUT TO:
POV FROM ACROSS THE RIVER... 
... on Glass sitting alone on the ice, holding that rifle.
FADE OUT.
