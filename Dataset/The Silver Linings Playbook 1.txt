That was when I was an X-ray technician with my ADD and my anxiety. I had a lot of access to medication and I took advantage of it. That’s when my hair was long, too. But my hair only grew when I was older. When I was younger, my hair didn’t grow because my brother... 
(to Pat)
Remember I told you about my brother, he had a Jheri curl, and I couldn’t get a Jheri curl because my hair didn’t grow long enough. I was so jealous of my brother...

DOLORES
Well, he’s ready. Look at him.
PAT
You didn’t tell Dad you were
picking me up?
DOLORES
Don’t worry about that.
PAT SR.
I wanna make sure when you come out that you’re okay, and she didn’t say anything. (to Dolores) You didn’t tell me?
DOLORES
The court said yes. Don’t worry.
12.
PAT SR.
Yeah, but what did the doctor say? Because the, the court listens to the doctor.
PAT
Yeah, and the court said--
PAT SR.
The court listens to the doctor,
the doctor--
PAT
Dad, relax. The court said it’s
fine, okay? Let it go.
DOLORES
Don’t worry.
PAT
Dad, I’m in there because of the court. That’s the agreement that we made months ago. It was a plea bargain with the courts. The lawyer, he instructed me, he said that what we should plead that, and then I would serve eight months and then I’d get out.
PAT SR.
Yeah, no, I just--
DOLORES

From your bookmaking?
PAT SR.
Who told you that?
PAT
Mom told me. Outside.
DOLORES
I did not. No, I didn’t.
PAT
You just told me outside, Mom, what are you talking about? Five minutes ago, we were walking up the stairs, you said, “Don’t say anything, but Dad lost his job and he’s bookmaking.”
PAT SR.
Why, Dolores? Why did you say that to him? He has the wrong idea.
(to Pat)
Everything’s fine, Patrick. I’m
more concerned about you than
anything else.
PAT
Good, Dad. Good.
PAT SR.
Okay, the question, the big question, is what are you gonna do with yourself?
PAT
What am I gonna do? I’m getting in shape, I’m getting trim, I’m getting really fit for Nikki. I’m gonna read Nikki’s teaching syllabus and get my old job back.
PAT SR.
Nikki sold the house. She left.
Didn’t your mother tell you that?
PAT
Let me tell you something. You don’t know anything about my marriage, okay, Dad? All right? Our marriage... we’re very, very much in love, okay? Just like you two.
PAT SR.
Listen, Patrick, she’s gone. She’s not around anymore. Nikki left.
14.
PAT
What are you doing, Dad? You know
what? Excelsior. Excelsior.
PAT SR.
What does that mean?
PAT
It means you know what I’m gonna
do, I’m gonna take all this
negativity and use it as fuel and
I’m gonna find a silver lining,
that’s what I’m gonna do. And
that’s no bullshit. That’s no
bullshit. That takes work and
that’s the truth.

And they escape up into the mountains and they’re gonna be happy, and they’re gonna be drinking wine and they dance -- they both like to dance with each other, there’s scenes of them dancing, which was boring, but I liked it, because they were happy. You think he ends it there? No! He writes another ending. She dies, Dad! I mean, the world’s hard enough as it is, guys. It’s fucking hard enough as it is. Can’t somebody say, “Hey, let’s be positive? Let’s have a good ending to the story?”
DOLORES

DR. PATEL
All right. Can you talk about
something that you did, before or
after?
PAT
Yeah, about a week before the
incident, I called the cops and I
told them that my wife and the
history guy were plotting against
me by embezzling money from the
local high school, which wasn’t
true. It was a delusion. And we
later found out from the hospital
that’s because I’m, uh... 
DR. PATEL
... undiagnosed bipolar.
PAT
Yeah. With mood swings and weird thinking brought on by severe stress, which rarely happens, thank God. And then the shower incident happened and that’s when everything snapped, so I then realized that, oh, wow, I’ve been dealing with this my whole life. And without any supervision I’ve been doing it all on my own with no help and basically I’ve been white-knuckling it this whole time.
23.
DR. PATEL
That had to be hard.

Yeah. It’s a lot to deal with, especially when you don’t know what the hell is happening, which I do now. Sort of.

Uh-huh.
RONNIE
Cool, man. Wow, you lost a lot of
weight. I almost didn’t recognize
you.
PAT
Thank you.

I'm sorry I didn't visit you in the hospital. You know, work’s out of control, you know, she had the baby. I’m really glad you’re back. I missed you. I really need someone to talk to. You gotta come see the baby. She’s beautiful. And Veronica wants to make dinner for you.
PAT
Congratulations on the baby, but
I’m not buying the invitation.
RONNIE
'Cause you think Veronica still
hates you?
31.
PAT
I know Veronica still hates me.
RONNIE
That’s not true.

Yes, it is. Nikki always said that “Ronnie’s wife keeps his social calendar where she keeps his balls, in her purse.”
RONNIE
That's not true.
UPSTAIRS WINDOW RONNIE’S HOUSE OPENS IN BG. WIFE VERONICA LEANS OUT.
VERONICA
Ronnie! What are you doing?

VERONICA
Did you invite him?
RONNIE
Yes.

Well, can he make it?

PAT SR.
As soon as you left, the Redskins threw a trick play, a pitch out to Randal El. Andy Reid wastes a time-out challenging it, loses the challenge, loses the game. You're in this house, please show some respect for what I do. And we should spend time together anyway. I’m trying to keep you out of trouble, please.
PAT
I have very, good news, everybody.
Very good news.
PAT SR.
What’s that? What’s the good news?
PAT
Things are looking up.
PAT SR.
Oh, are they?
PAT PICKS UP THE PHONE TO DIAL.
PAT
You know what, I knew why they
invited me over. I knew it.
PAT SR.
Listen, she might be with that guy.
That, the... .
PAT
Oh, no way!
PAT SR.
She--, no, she might be with him.
She’s afraid of you. She doesn’t
want to talk to you.
PAT
No way, Dad. You mean, Doug
Culpepper?
33.
PAT SR.
Put the phone down. You gotta... 
PAT
Wait just a minute.
PAT SR REACHES FOR THE TELEPHONE.
PAT SR.
... Put the phone down, please.

THEY BOTH PULL ON THE TELEPHONE RECEIVER.
PAT SR.
Listen--, stop.
PAT
Give me the phone. Dad, this is my life. Dad.
PAT SR.
Gimme the phone. Gimme the phone.
DOLORES
Pat!
PAT SR.
You gotta understand me. You wanna go back? Well then, stop this! Then don’t fucking do this.
PAT
(tearfully)
Don’t talk to me like that.
PAT SR.
Well then, don’t behave this way.

INT. SOLATANO HOUSE/FOYER - DAY
PAT SR. OPENING THE FRONT DOOR TO A POLICE OFFICER STANDING ON THE PORCH. HE IS OFFICER KEOGH.
OFFICER KEOGH
... check on this house. Pat
Solatano?
34.
PAT
Yeah.
OFFICER KEOGH
Yeah? Missus Solatano, Mister
Solatano, I’m Officer Keogh. I work
this beat. Look, I heard about the
restraining order. And I heard you
went to your old house and the
school. It’s not okay. I’ve been
assigned to your case, so you’re
gonna be seeing a lot of me. Do
yourself a favor. Respect the
restraining order, okay? Five
hundred feet.
PAT SR.
You hear what he just said? You
have a restraining order.
PAT
Yeah, Dad, I know.
PAT SR.
Thank you, Officer.
OFFICER KEOGH
If you need anything... my card.

INT. OFFICE/DR. PATEL’S OFFICE - DAY
DR. PATEL
Tell me one thing. Would you like to be a guy who goes back to jail or to the hospital? Hmm? So take your medication and if you do fine, we’ll reduce them.
PAT
Nikki’s waiting for me to get in shape and get my life in order, and then she’s gonna be with me. And that’s better than any medication.
35.
DR. PATEL
Pat, there’s a possibility, and I want you to be prepared for it, that she may not return. True love is about letting her go and seeing if she returns. In the meantime, if you listen to that song, I don’t want you to fall apart. So get a strategy, okay? You need one.
PAT
Let me say something, I gotta say
something.
DR. PATEL
Okay.
PAT
This is what I believe to be true. This is what I learned in the hospital. You have to do everything you can, you have to work your hardest, and if you do, if you stay positive, you have a shot at a silver lining.
DR. PATEL
Work on a strategy, okay?
PAT
Hey, my friend Ronnie’s having this party on Sunday night and it’s like a real hoity-toity thing and his wife, Veronica’s a real stickler for... . I don’t know, my mom got
this Gap outfit she wants me to wear, but I wanna wear a jersey that my brother, Jake, got me from the Eagles.
DR. PATEL
Which jersey?
PAT
DeSean Jackson.
DR. PATEL
DeSean Jackson is the man.

PAT
I can’t stay, come on. I made a
mistake, I shouldn’t have worn
this.
RONNIE
Dude, you’re fine. I like that
jersey. I wish I was wearing that
jersey.
PAT
I feel like an idiot.
RONNIE
Are you comfortable?
PAT
Veronica’s not gonna like it.
RONNIE
Get over here.

you wanna come.

Really?
RONNIE
