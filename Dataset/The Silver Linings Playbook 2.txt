RONNIE	(CONT'D)
You start snapping up commercial

when you make the money. But the
pressure... it’s like... .
RONNIE GLANCES, LOOKING FOR VERONICA.
PAT
You okay?
RONNIE

I’m not okay. Don’t tell anybody.
Listen to me. I feel like I’m
getting crushed and--
PAT
(whispering)
Crushed by what?
RONNIE
(whispering)
Everything. The family, the baby, the job, the fucking dicks at work, and it’s like, you know, like I’m trying to do this, (Ronnie reaches for his throat, mimicking trying to breath) you know, and, and, and I’m like... suffocating.
RONNIE COVERS HIS FACE WITH ONE HAND.

PAT (CONT’D)
What about your job?

VERONICA
Ooh, ooh, warmer, warmer, warmer.
TIFFANY

Well, I don’t have an iPod. I don’t even have a phone. They won’t let me make any calls. They think I’m gonna call Nikki.
RONNIE
Don’t worry about it. Don’t focus
on that.

RONNIE
Pat was a history sub at the high school, Tiffany. Ask him about any president, he knows 'em all.
PAT
Here’s a fun fact. You know where
the term “OK” comes from?
VERONICA
No. No, I don’t.
RONNIE
Where?
PAT
Well, Martin Van Buren, the eighth president of the United States of America, is from Kinderhook, New York... 
VERONICA
Oh.
PAT
... and he was part of a club, a men’s club, called Old Kinderhook. And if you were cool, you were in the club, they’d say, “That guy’s OK.” ‘Cause he was in the Old Kinderhooks.
RONNIE
Really?
PAT
Yeah. Pretty cool, right?
RONNIE
That’s interesting.
45.
VERONICA
You know, Tiffany's been doing this dance thing for years and she’s real good at it. She's gonna be competing at the Ben Franklin Hotel.
PAT
Oh, really? My wife loves dance.
Nikki loves dance.
TIFFANY
Why do you have to talk about me
like that?
VERONICA
I’m just bragging about you. Can’t
I brag about my little sister?
TIFFANY
Don’t talk about me in the third
person.
VERONICA
Please, gimme a break.
TIFFANY
I’m right here.
VERONICA
Just be nice. Just be nice.
PAT
Wow, wow, wow. Fascinating.
TIFFANY
Sorry. I don’t wanna be mean.
VERONICA
I know. I know, I know.
TIFFANY
(to Pat)
What meds are you on?
PAT
Me? None. I used to be on Lithium and Seroquel and Abilify, but I don't take them anymore, no. They make me foggy and they also make me bloated.
TIFFANY
Yeah, I was on Xanax and Effexor, but I agree, I wasn’t as sharp, so I stopped.
46.
PAT
You ever take Klonopin?
TIFFANY
Klonopin? (Chuckling) Yeah.
PAT
Right?
TIFFANY
Jesus.
PAT
It’s like, “What? What day is it?”
How about Trazodone?
TIFFANY
Trazodone!
TIFFANY LAUGHS
PAT
Oh, it flattens you out. I mean,
you are done. It takes the light
right out of your eyes.
TIFFANY
God, I bet it does.
VERONICA AND RONNIE FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE. TIFFANY STANDS UP.
TIFFANY (CONT’D)
I'm tired. I wanna go.
VERONICA
No. No, no, no, no. We haven’t, we haven’t even finished the salad yet, or the duck. I made the Fire and Ice cake.
TIFFANY
I said I’m tired. (to Pat) Are you gonna walk me home or what?
PAT
You mean me?
TIFFANY
Yeah, you. Are you gonna walk me
home?
PAT
You have poor social skills. You
have a problem.
47.
TIFFANY
I have a problem? You say more
inappropriate things than
appropriate things. You scare
people.
PAT
I tell the truth. But you’re mean.
TIFFANY
What? I’m not telling the truth?
Veronica and Ronnie are very uncomfortable.
RONNIE
Um, maybe I should drive them home separately?
VERONICA
You can drive them both home. Now.
TIFFANY
Stop talking about me in third
person.
VERONICA
You can take Tiffany home first.
TIFFANY
You love it when I have problems. You love it, Von, because then you can be the good one. Just say it.
VERONICA
No... 
PAT STANDS UP.
VERONICA (CONT’D)
... I don’t. I don’t. I just wanted to have a nice, I just wanted to have a nice dinner.
TIFFANY
Oh, God.
VERONICA
What is your problem?!
TIFFANY
Nothing’s my problem! I’m fine. I’m tired and I wanna go. (to Pat) Come on, are you ready?

You really, you really wanna go
right now?

This is me.
TIFFANY AND PAT STOP, FACE EACH OTHER.
TIFFANY (CONT’D)
Listen, I haven't dated since
before my marriage so I don't
really remember how this works.
PAT
How what works?
TIFFANY
I saw the way you were looking at me, Pat. You felt it, I felt it, don't lie. We're not liars like they are. I live in the addition around back, which is completely separate from my parents' house, so there's no chance of them walking in on us. I hate the fact that you wore a football jersey to dinner because I hate football, but you can fuck me if you turn the lights off, okay?
PAT IS MOMENTARILY SPEECHLESS.
49.
PAT
How old are you?
TIFFANY
Old enough to have a marriage end
and not wind up in a mental
hospital.
PAT
Look, I had a really good time
tonight and I think you're really
pretty, but I'm married, okay?
PAT HOLDS UP HIS HAND, DISPLAYING HIS WEDDING RING.

You seemed to have trouble last

Let me just set the record straight about last night. Hurting my mother was a mistake and I hate myself for it, and I hate my illness and I want to control it. My father, on the other hand, had no trouble slapping the shit out of me last night, which I did not return ‘cause I could’ve killed him and I didn’t. He’s sixty-five years old. You don’t think I could’ve beat the shit out of him? I mean... .
DR. PATEL
He was scared for your mother and
you hurt him as well.
PAT
Yes, last night was a mess. Okay? And I think he probably just tried to do his best.
DR. PATEL
Pat, you have to have a strategy. I told you earlier. You need to recognize these feelings coming to you, otherwise you will be sent back to Baltimore. So when you get these feelings, you need to get to a quieter place, and be at peace with yourself, however you can.
PAT
Yeah, but that’s easier said than
done.
DR. PATEL
You have to do it. You have no
choice. Excelsior.
PAT
Yeah, Excelsior. Listen, I have a
letter I want you to give Nikki,
okay?
DR. PATEL
No.
PAT
Why?
64.
DR. PATEL
Because you have a restraining
order.
PAT
(sighs)
What good are you, man?
DR. PATEL
Why did you have this overwhelming urgency to see your wedding video last night?
PAT
Oh, I don’t know, because I’m married and I haven’t seen my wife in eight and a half months?
DR. PATEL
Maybe you think that Nikki’s not around and Tiffany’s an attractive girl and if you get drawn towards Tiffany, you will spoil your chances of getting Nikki back to you?
PAT
Not bad, Doctor Jones. But I don't think I'm gonna blow it with Nikki because Tiffany's a slut.
DR. PATEL
Why is she a slut?
PAT
After the dinner at Ronnie's, she said, quote, "We can go to the back house and you can fuck me as long as we turn the lights out." Unquote. And she still wears her wedding ring. So she's a loyal, married-to-a-dead-guy slut.
DR. PATEL
Maybe she just needs a friend and she thought if she offers you sex, it will be easier for you to become friends with her.
PAT
She said she's not a whore anymore, but she likes that part of herself along with all the other parts of herself and can I say the same?
DR. PATEL
Can you?
65.
PAT
Is that... .? You’re asking me,
you’re really asking me that
question?
DR. PATEL
Yes.
PAT
With all my crazy sad shit? What,
are you fucking nuts?
DR. PATEL
Pat, the silver lining thing is
yours. I'm just giving back your
words to you. This "crazy sad
shit," as you call it, made you a
happier, calmer person with a
beautiful positive philosophy of
going outdoors, working out, and
reading books.
PAT
No, not the books.
DR. PATEL
You said Nikki’s friends with Ronnie, Veronica and Tiffany. So if you become friends with Tiffany, Nikki will think that you’re a kind, generous, large-hearted person, who helps people in need, who is basically thriving. So if you help Tiffany, it will be good for you.
EXT. STREET - DAY
PAT RUNS. CAMERA TILTS UP AND MOVES BG. WITH HIM. CHILDREN AND PARENTS ARE ON THE SIDEWALK, DRESSED IN HALLOWEEN COSTUMES.
CHILD (O.C.)
Trick or treat!
PAT LOOKS AT THE MAXWELL HOUSE AS HE RUNS PAST IT. HE RUNS ONTO THE SIDEWALK. HE RUNS AROUND A TREE. TIFFANY ENTERS AND CIRCLES HIM.
TIFFANY
Hey!
THEY RUN.
PAT
How do you know when I run?
66.
TIFFANY
I wanted to clarify something. I
just want us to be friends.
(Pat doesn’t answer)
Did you hear what I said?
(Pat doesn’t answer still)
Why are you giving me such a hard
time?
PAT
No, I'm not giving you a hard time.
PAT AND TIFFANY RUN ACROSS THE STREET TOWARD A SMALL DINER.
TIFFANY
I don’t know how to act with you
when you do this shit.
PAT STOPS.
PAT
(winded)
You wanna have dinner at this
diner?
TIFFANY IS MOMENTARILY TAKEN ABACK BY PAT’S PROPOSAL.
TIFFANY
Pick me up at seven thirty.
SHE RUNS AND EXITS.
EXT. STREET - EVENING
SEVERAL CHILDREN RUN AROUND IN COSTUMES. PAT WALKS TO THE MAXWELLS’ DRIVEWAY AND STOPS. CAMERA DOLLIES L. AROUND HIM.
WE SEE TIFFANY AS SHE WALKS AND WE SEE TIFFANY’S PARENTS PEER THROUGH A LIVING ROOM WINDOW.
TIFFANY’S GRANDMOTHER LOOKS FROM AN UPSTAIRS WINDOW.
PAT
Happy Halloween.
TIFFANY
Hi.
ACROSS THE STREET TO THE DINER, PAT AND TIFFANY WALK TOWARD IT.
INT. DINER - EVENING
PAT OPENS THE DOOR FOR TIFFANY AS SHE WALKS INTO THE DINER.
PAT FOLLOWS.
67.
EXT. DINER - EVENING
THROUGH THE WINDOWS, TO A WAITRESS AS SHE LEADS TIFFANY AND PAT L. TO A BOOTH. CAMERA PANS WITH THEM.
INT. DINER- EVENING
WAITRESS
Here you go.
TIFFANY
Thank you.
PAT LOOKS AT THE MENU. THE WAITRESS STANDS, WAITING.
PAT
I'm gonna have a bowl of your
Raisin Bran.
TIFFANY’S PERPLEXED.
TIFFANY
Tea.
THE WAITRESS TAKES THE MENUS FROM THEM AND WALKS AWAY.
WAITRESS
Be right back.
PAT
You look nice.
TIFFANY
Thanks.
THE WAITRESS ENTERS L. WITH THEIR ORDER.
WAITRESS
Raisin Bran. Milk.
TIFFANY WATCHES AS THE WAITRESS SETS HER TEA DOWN.
TIFFANY
Thank you.
PAT POURS HIS CEREAL INTO A BOWL. PAUSES.
PAT
You want to share this?
TIFFANY
Why did you order Raisin Bran?
PAT
Why did you order tea?
68.
SHE EATS CEREAL.
TIFFANY
(chewing)
Because you ordered Raisin Bran.
PAT
I ordered Raisin Bran because I
didn’t want there to be any
mistaking this for a date.
TIFFANY
(chewing)
It can still be a date if you order Raisin Bran.
PAT
It's not a date. So how's your thing going -- your dancing thing?
TIFFANY
It's good. How's your restraining
order?
PAT
I wouldn't actually call the restraining order "my thing,” but getting back with Nikki is, and I've been doing pretty well. Except for a minor incident at the doctor's office.
TIFFANY
And the so-called incident with the weights.
PAT
Yeah. That was a thing with my parents. I wish I could just explain it all in a letter to Nikki because it was minor and I could just explain it and let her know that I’m actually not out of control and that I’m actually doing really well.
TIFFANY TAKES THIS IN. BEAT.
TIFFANY
I can get a letter to Nikki. I see her sometimes with my sister.
PAT CAN’T BELIEVE WHAT HE IS HEARING.
PAT
It would be so amazing if you could get a letter to Nikki from me.
69.
TIFFANY
I'd have to hide it from Veronica. She's not into breaking the law, which this letter would definitely be doing.
PAT
But you would do it?
TIFFANY
I’d have to be careful. I'm already on thin ice with my family, you should hear how I lost my job.
PAT
How did you lose your job?
TIFFANY
By... having sex with everybody in
the office.
PAT
Everybody?
TIFFANY
I was very depressed after Tommy
died. It was a lot of people.
PAT
We don't have to talk about it.
TIFFANY
Thanks.
PAT
How many were there?
TIFFANY
Eleven.
PAT
Wow.
TIFFANY
I know.
PAT
I’m not gonna talk about it
anymore.
TIFFANY
Okay.
PAT
Can I ask you one more question?
Were there any women?
70.
TIFFANY
Yes.
PAT
Really?
TIFFANY
Yes.
PAT
What was that like?
TIFFANY
Hot.
PAT
Jesus Christ. Was it like... older women, a sexy teacher who wants to seduce you--
TIFFANY
Made me sit on her lap and do
things? Yeah.
PAT
What? You sat on her lap?
TIFFANY
Mm-hmm.
PAT
She told you what to do?
TIFFANY
Mm-hmm.
PAT
Oh... my God. Nikki hated when I talked like this. Made me feel like such a pervert. Maybe we should change the subject.
TIFFANY
I don’t mind it.
PAT
You don’t, do you.
TIFFANY
No. But then people were getting into fights in the parking lot at work, and in the bathroom... and the boss called me in to his office and tried to pin it all on me. So I accused him of harassment and then they fired me, sent me home and put me on some meds.
71.
PAT
I get it. The song that was playing when my wife... was in the shower with the history teacher... 
TIFFANY
I heard about that.
PAT
... it was my wedding song and when I hear it, I go kinda crazy. Sometimes I hear it when it’s not even playing.
TIFFANY
Wow.
PAT
Yeah. So they put me on medication, which I feel ashamed of.
TIFFANY
Yeah.
PAT
So I know.
TIFFANY
You do.
PAT
I just gotta get a strategy, you
know?
TIFFANY
Me too.
PAT
We’d better get back to the letter.
TIFFANY
Yeah, let’s get back to the letter.
PAT
What if you told Nikki when
Veronica was in the bathroom?
TIFFANY
Yes. Yes, that could work. I love
that.
PAT
Oh, my God, I’m gonna go home and
write the letter right now.
PAT BEGINS TO SLIDE OUT OF THE BOOTH.
72.
TIFFANY
Can I at least finish my tea?
PAT
Wait, what?
TIFFANY
My tea. Can I finish it?
PAT
Wait a minute. Did Veronica tell
Nikki about our dinner? Why would
she do that? Was it a test?
TIFFANY
I kinda got that feeling, yeah.
PAT
Goddamn it. I knew it. It was a
test. How did I do? I think I did
pretty well.
TIFFANY
Yeah, she said you were cool,
basically.
PAT
“Basically”? Was I some percentage not cool?
TIFFANY
No, she said you were cool, but you know.
PAT
No, I don’t know.
TIFFANY
Sort of how you are. It’s fine,
relax.
PAT
What do you mean? How am I? What
does that mean?
TIFFANY
Sort of like me.
PAT
"Sort of like you"? I hope to God
she didn't tell Nikki that.
TIFFANY
Why?
73.
PAT
Because, it's just not right, lumping you and I together, I mean, it’s just wrong. And Nikki wouldn’t like that. Especially after all the shit you just told me.
TIFFANY
You think that I'm crazier than
you.
PAT
(scoffs) (chuckling)
Because, well, we’re different, I
mean--
TIFFANY
Oh, my God. Ugh. You’re killing me. You know what? Forget I offered to help you. Forget the entire fucking idea. ‘Cause that must have been fucking crazy because I am so much crazier than you.
PAT
Keep your voice down.
TIFFANY
I’m just the crazy slut with a dead husband!
HALLOWEEN DINERS LOOK.

PAT
Hey, come on. Look, I don't think

PAT HURRIES TO TIFFANY.
TIFFANY
Yes, you do.
PAT
No, I don’t.
TIFFANY
You told your therapist that you
were in a superior mental illness
category, didn't you?
PAT
What? Hey, calm down! Hey--
TIFFANY STOPPING AND TURNING TO FACE PAT.
TIFFANY
Just leave me alone!
75.
PAT
Can I just explain myself, please? I didn’t want Nikki to think that I was associated with that kind of sexual behavior because I’ve never done anything like that, okay?
TIFFANY
You may not have experienced the shit that I did. But you loved hearing about it, didn’t you? You are afraid to be alive, you’re afraid to live. You’re a hypocrite. You’re a conformist. You’re a liar. I opened up to you and you judged me. You are an asshole. You are an asshole!
TIFFANY GRABS PAT’S JACKET COLLAR.
TIFFANY (CONT’D)
Get off of me! (yelling) Get off!
You’re harassing me!
PAT
Hey, hey!
TIFFANY
(yelling)
He’s harassing me!

OFFICER KEOGH

are you doing? What are you doing
to these kids?
CAMERA PANS WITH OFFICER KEOGH AS HE WALKS TO PAT, GRABS HIS ARM.
