OFFICER KEOGH
(walks crowd back)
Let’s go, clear out, nothing going on here.
AS -- TIFFANY LEANS IN CLOSE TO PAT WHO IS UPSET, SONG PLAYING IN HIS HEAD. Tormented.
TIFFANY
You gonna go your whole life scared of that song? It’s just a song. Don’t make it a monster.
She leans close to Pat’s downcast face.
77.
TIFFANY (CONT’D)
There’s no song playing.	There’s
no song.	Breathe, count backwards
from ten.	That’s it.
Pat breathes, listens to her.	Calms himself. Song stops.
Tiffany’s face stays close to his.
TIFFANY (CONT’D)
That’s it. There you go. I’m sorry.
I’m sorry.
PAT
I’m sorry.
TIFFANY
I took it too far.
PAT
I’m sorry.
OFFICER KEOGH
(pulls her away)
Hey, is he messing with you?
TIFFANY
No, no. No, this was just a joke.
This is a joke I started.
OFFICER KEOGH
There's a restraining order on this guy.
TIFFANY
I know, I have a stupid sense of
humor.
OFFICER KEOGH
That’s not a good thing to do.
TIFFANY
Well, I’m fucked up. What can I
tell you? I’m sorry.
OFFICER KEOGH
You're Tommy's widow, right?
TIFFANY
Yes, I'm Tommy's crazy whore widow, minus the whore thing for the most part.
OFFICER KEOGH
You’re a funny girl. You wanna get a drink sometime?
TIFFANY TURNS AND WALKS AWAY.
78.
OFFICER KEOGH (CONT’D)
What’d I say?
PAT
She doesn’t, she doesn’t do that
anymore.
EXT. STREET - EVENING
TIFFANY WALKS - upset, vulnerable. Pat walks behind, CATCHES UP TO TIFFANY AND THEY WALK TOGETHER.
PAT
I'm sorry about what I said in the diner.
TIFFANY
I know. I know you didn’t mean it.
PAT
I didn’t mean it at all.
TIFFANY
I know, you say shit you don’t mean all the time.
PAT
All the time.
TIFFANY
I’ll still give your letter to
Nikki, don’t worry.
TIFFANY WALKS THE DRIVEWAY TOWARD HER GARAGE. Pat watches her go.
PAT
Wow. I really appreciate that,
Tiffany.
TIFFANY
(walking away)
I know you do.
PAT
You do?
TIFFANY
(disheartened)
Yeah, sure.
PAT
I’ll see you tomorrow? With the
letter?
79.
INT. SOLATANO HOUSE/DINING ROOM - DAY
PAT SR.’S BOOKMAKING MATERIALS SPREAD OUT ON THE DINING TABLE.
RANDY
I’ll bet I know what happened if only one is missing. Either Dolores or Pat needed an envelope and one of ‘em took it. That’s the only answer.
PAT SR.
No, no, no.
DOLORES, PREPARING FOOD IN THE KITCHEN.
PAT SR.	(CONT’D)
Dolores, somebody was in my study.
Who took one of my envelopes?
Somebody took an envelope.
DOLORES
Maybe we should call the FBI.
PAT SR.
Don’t make fun. This is serious. What FBI? Come on, let’s take a look. I’ll show you what this is. I’m gonna just explain to you something. I mean, you know what I’m doing, honey. This everything, like this. I got this, it all corresponds.
PAT ENTERS.
PAT
Dad, I borrowed one of your
envelopes. I hope that’s not a
problem
PAT SR.
No, it’s not okay. It’s not okay.
You gotta ask.
DOLORES
“Do not go in my study or I will
eat you!”
RANDY LAUGHS
PAT SR.
It’s not funny, it’s not funny. What’s everybody making a joke out of this for?
80.
RANDY
Dolores, you are so beautiful!
PAT SR.
(to Randy)
Stop that! Hey, hey, hey, stop,
stop, stop!
(to Pat)
Listen, a lot of envelopes go in and out of my office every day after games with a lot of cash in ‘em. So show some respect for what I do.
PAT
Yeah, I know. I saw two-seven-four. I just wanted to tell you the number.
PAT SR.
Thank you.
PAT
But the envelope was empty. I’m sorry, you were sleeping. I didn’t want to wake you, but I needed an envelope.
PAT SR.
You didn’t want to wake me? (to Dolores and Randy) He didn’t want to wake me. He doesn’t have a problem complaining about Ernest fucking Hemingway. He doesn’t have a problem asking for his wedding video-
DOLORES
Be nice. It’s game day! I’m makin’ crabby snacks and homemades.
PAT
Yeah, come on, Dad, be nice. Come on, she’s making crabby snacks and homemades. Come on, Dad!
PAT SR.
What are you so up about?
DOLORES
He’s very happy.
PAT
I’m happy.
PAT SR.
No, you’re so up, up, up, up.
81.
PAT
Isn’t that a good thing?
PAT SR.
You’re just up, up, up. I don’t
know what that is. Are you taking
the proper dosage of your
medication?
PAT
Am I taking the right dose? Of
course I am.
PAT SR.
Okay. Taking a little bit too many or something?
PAT
No, if I was taking that, I’d be on the floor, Dad.
PAT SR.
Just stay with us. Stay for the
game. Spend some family time.
PAT
Dad, I can’t. Look, I’m ready to
go.
PAT SR.
Spend family time.
PAT
Wait, you mean OCD, superstitious
time?
RANDY
Come on, your dad needs a winner.
Help him out.
PAT SR.
Come on.
PAT
I can’t.
PAT SR.
It’s the Seahawks. Put on the
jersey and stay, please. Please.
It’s important, please.
DOLORES
What are you up to, Pat?
PAT
Nothing, come on.
82.
DOLORES
What’s in the envelope?
PAT SR.
Yeah, what are you doing? What’s in that envelope?
PAT
Guys, I’m beating the song! I'm on the scoreboard! I'm playing down field! I feel great!
PAT WALKS OUT THE DOOR.
EXT. MAXWELL HOUSE/FRONT PORCH - DAY
PAT WALKS TO THE DOOR AND KNOCKS.
PAT
Tiffany!
PAT PUSHES THE DOORBELL.
TIFFANY’S MOTHER OPENS THE FRONT DOOR.
PAT	(CONT’D)
Hey, how you doin’? Is Tiffany
here?
TIFFANY’S MOTHER
What do you want with her?
TIFFANY’S FATHER APPEARS.
TIFFANY’S FATHER
Is that another creep? What do you want, creep? Just beat it.
PAT
Whoa, no, no, no. No, I’m married.
PAT HOLDS UP HIS HAND, POINTING TO HIS WEDDING RING.
A CAR PARKS AT THE CURB IN BG.
TIFFANY’S FATHER
Oh, great, a married creep.
PAT
I’m her friend.
ANOTHER MAN, JORDIE, JOGS UP TO THE PORCH, BEHIND PAT.
PAT (CONT’D)
We go running. Have you guys not
seen us? I took her to the diner.
83.
TIFFANY’S MOTHER
She’s not here.
JORDIE
Hi, guys. How’s it going? Hey. Is
Tiffany home?
TIFFANY’S MOTHER
Go away.
JORDIE
I know her. I know her, we’ve
dated. We still date.
PAT
What are you doing here?
JORDIE
I’ve called her, I’ve texted her.
PAT
Do you know this guy?
JORDIE
I still haven’t heard back. We used to work together--
TIFFANY’S FATHER
Just get the hell out of here... 
JORDIE’S HAND, HOLDING OUT A BUSINESS CARD.
JORDIE
I just wanted to give you my card
to give to her.
TIFFANY’S FATHER
Another rude creep.
PAT
Listen to what he’s saying. Listen to what he’s saying.
JORDIE
What’s he saying?
PAT
He’s saying you’re being rude.
JORDIE
How am I being rude?
PAT
Oh, you know. You know. Come on. Sometimes it’s okay with girls like this, they wanna have fun and sometimes --
84.
INT. MAXWELL HOUSE/HALLWAY - DAY
TIFFANY STANDS CONCEALED BEHIND DOOR LISTENING.
PAT
--it’s not because they got a broken wing, and they’re hurt, and they’re an easy target. And in this case, in this particular case, I think that wing is being fixed.
EXT. MAXWELL HOUSE/FRONT PORCH - DAY
PAT
And you gotta make sure it gets
mended. And you’re gettin’ in the
way of that right now, okay?
Because she’s sensitive and she’s
smart, she’s artistic. This is a
great girl and you gotta be
respectful of that. Come on.
PAT TURNS AND LEADS JORDIE BACK TO HIS CAR.
PAT (CONT’D)
Let me walk you down to your car. You’re a better guy than this. I can see it in your eyes.
JORDIE LOOKS OVER HIS SHOULDER TOWARDS TIFFANY’S STUNNED PARENTS.
JORDIE
She just texted me!
INT. MAXWELL HOUSE/HALLWAY - DAY
TIFFANY BEHIND DOOR TAKES IN HOW PAT STOOD UP FOR HER.
THINKS.
EXT. STREET - DAY
PAT RUNS. TIFFANY ENTERS. PAT REACTS.
PAT
Hey! Hey, wait a second! What are you doing? What happened? How come you weren’t outside? What the hell’s going on?
THEY STOP, FACING EACH OTHER.
TIFFANY
I can’t, I can’t do it.
85.
PAT
What do you mean, you can’t do it?
You can’t do what?
TIFFANY
I can’t give the letter to Nikki.
PAT
Tiffany, what are you talking
about? What do you mean you can’t
give the letter to Nikki?
TIFFANY
Because what am I getting in return? What are you doing for me?
PAT
You said! You said if I wrote a
letter, you’d get it to Nikki.
TIFFANY
I know.
PAT
That was the set-up.
TIFFANY
Because I do this time after time after time, I do all this shit for other people and then I wake up and, and I’m empty, I have nothing!
PAT
What are you talking about? You seem like you’re a tough girl to me. Why don’t you just do things on your own?
TIFFANY
I always get myself in these fucking situations. I give everything to other people and nobody ever, I never -- I don’t get what I want, okay? I’m not my sister.
Pat takes this in.
PAT
Alright, well, ask for you. What
can I do for you?
TIFFANY
I can’t do it.
PAT
Tiffany, what do you want me to do?
86.
TIFFANY SIGHS.
PAT	(CONT’D)
Think of something.
TIFFANY
There’s this thing.
PAT
There’s a thing, okay. What kind of thing?
TIFFANY
It’s a thing, it’s a thing. It’s a, it’s a dance thing.
PAT
It’s a dance thing, all right.
TIFFANY
It’s a competition thing at the
Benjamin Franklin Hotel. Tommy
would never do it with me and I
missed it every single year.
PAT
Well, Tommy’s dead, so he’s not
gonna fucking do it.
TIFFANY
Would you please!
PAT
I don’t have a filter when I talk.
TIFFANY
Can we have one conversation
without you reminding me that my
goddamn husband is dead? My God.
PAT
Yes, I’m sorry. I’m sorry. Okay,
I’m sorry.
TIFFANY
But I can only do it if I have a partner... and now I’m about to miss it for another year.
PAT
Whoa, whoa, whoa, I’m not gonna
fuckin’ dance with you. What are
you talking about?
87.
TIFFANY
What, your schedule is so busy?
“Grapes of Wrath” and watching
football with your dad?
PAT
Tiffany, I’m not gonna do a dance
with you.
TIFFANY
All right, then I’m not giving her your fucking letter.
TIFFANY WALKS AWAY.
PAT
Wait a second! But you promised you would do this.
TIFFANY TURNS
TIFFANY
Think about it.
TIFFANY TURNS AND WALKS.
PAT
Well, I already did do something
for you, you know.
TIFFANY TURNS.
TIFFANY
WHAT DID YOU DO FOR ME?
PAT
I took care of that jerkoff that
was in front of your house.
TIFFANY
What? Jordie?
PAT
Let me ask you something. Do you
call him when you’re lonely?
TIFFANY STOPS.
PAT (CONT’D)
That encourages him, Tiffany. You
shouldn’t do it.
TIFFANY
Couldn’t you say the same about you and Nikki?
88.
PAT
It’s not at all like me and Nikki. What are you talking about? We’re in love and we’re married. It’s completely different.
TIFFANY
How are you in love? Tell me about that. The big Nikki love. Tell me about it, I wanna understand it.
PAT
We have a very unconventional chemistry, it makes people feel awkward, but not me. She’s the most beautiful woman I’ve ever been with.
TIFFANY
Wow.
PAT
It’s electric between us, okay? Yeah, we wanna change each other, but that’s normal, couples wanna do that, I want her to stop dressing like she dresses, I want her to stop acting so superior to me, okay? And she wanted me to lose weight and stop my mood swings, both of which I’ve done. I mean, people fight. Couples fight. We would fight, we wouldn’t talk for a couple weeks. That’s normal. She always wanted the best for me.
Tiffany listens.
PAT	(CONT’D)
She wanted me to be passionate and compassionate. And that’s a good thing. You know? I just, look, I’m my best self today, and I think she’s her best self today, and our love’s gonna be fucking amazing.
TIFFANY
It’s gonna be amazing, and you’re gonna be amazing, and she’s gonna be amazing, and you’re not gonna be that guy that’s gonna take advantage of a situation without offering to do something back. So think about the dance thing.
TIFFANY TURNS AND WALKS.	PRELAP OF EAGLES GAME FADES IN.

And you’re here on game day?
INT. SOLATANO HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - DAY PAT EMBRACES DANNY.
DANNY
I’m out.
DANNY AND PAT EMBRACE.
DANNY (CONT’D)
It’s official, man. They didn't convert me to my Mental Hygiene Law admission status within two thirds of the maximum length of my felony sentence, so I'm out. They had to let me go.
PAT
I never understand what he’s
saying.
PAST DANNY, TO PAT SR. DOLORES AND RONNIE WATCH IN BG.
PAT SR.
Okay, jailhouse lawyer, come on,
let’s come back and sit down the

Whoa, whoa, whoa. Dad’s got you
sitting here?
PAT SR.
Oh, yeah.
DANNY
He calls me “Jailhouse Lawyer.”
DANNY SITS DOWN ON THE SOFA NEXT TO RANDY.

PAT SR.
Hold the remote the way you were
holding it before.
DANNY
Okay.
PAT SR. AND DANNY, WHO CAREFULLY HOLDS THE REMOTE CONTROL IN ONE HAND AND THE GREEN HANDKERCHIEF IN THE OTHER HAND.
PAT
And now you’re holding the remote?
DANNY
And it’s working. Your dad’s a
genius.
PAT SR. URGES DANNY TO SIT UP STRAIGHTER with remote.
PAT SR.
Now sit up.
PAT
And Danny’s the good luck charm?
PAT SR.
Danny’s from you. This is your
house, so it comes down to you.
You’re the one.
DANNY
Yeah, you’re the one, Pat.
PAT
Superstition, Danny. I don’t know.
WE SEE DOLORES.
PAT SR.
Come sit down.
PAT SR. (CONT’D)
Don’t disappear doing God knows
what with that Tiffany Maxwell.
PAT
Dad, Dad, Dad. She’s my friend. Why would you say that?
RONNIE
Oh, she’s a mess. You gotta be
careful. She goes to a lot of
therapy.
PAT SR. GROANS
91.
PAT
I go to a lot of therapy, Ronnie.
What are you trying to say?
RONNIE
I’m just saying--
PAT
(interrupting) )
Am I messed up?
PAT	(CONT’D)
Why don’t you stop judging people? You judge everybody. You’re the one who has a messed up marriage.
RONNIE
I’m just looking out for you, I’m
just looking out for you. She’s
unstable.
DOLORES
(alarmed)
What’s wrong with your marriage?
What’s wrong with your marriage?
RONNIE
Nothing’s wrong!
PAT
You should have seen when I was at his house. It’s like a circus over there.
RONNIE
Shh, shh.
RONNIE PUSHES PAT R. INTO THE FOYER.
PAT
What are you talking about? I’m not gonna hide this. You need to deal with it.
RONNIE
Stop breaking my balls.
RONNIE HOLDS UP AN IPOD.
PAT
Oh!!!!
RONNIE
I got you an iPod.
PAT
Whoa! Is this for me?
92.
RONNIE
Yeah. Well, that’s my old iPod, but-
PAT
(hugs Ronnie)
Oh, buddy, thank you. That’s so
nice of you. Wow.
RONNIE
Thirty-two gigabytes.
PAT
How many songs is that?
RONNIE
Seven thousand.
PAT
(scrolling through iPod)
Oh, yeah, you got The Stranglers.
You love The Stranglers. Oh, the
Sex Pistols. The Clash.
RONNIE
Got some Clash.
PAT
Oh, “West Side Story.”
RONNIE
Yeah, “West Side Story.” It makes
me peaceful.
(singing)
“Maria, I just met a girl named
Maria... ”
PAT
Right, right, right.
RONNIE
And then when I’m angry, which is a lot these days, I go to the garage... Metallica... Megadeth. I start fucking smashing shit.
PAT
You gotta get your marriage
together.
RONNIE
(whispering)
I start breaking shit, and I hurt
my hand. And --
PAT
Ronnie, that’s fucked up.
93.
RONNIE
Yeah, but it makes me feel better.
It’s like my therapy, you know?
PAT
When I’m with Nikki, I’m never
gonna do stuff like that... 
JAKE (O.S.)
Whoa, Nikki? What’s all this about
Nikki?
Pan from the framed photo of Jake on foyer wall, to Jake on the stairs above.
JAKE (CONT’D)
A restraining order is nothing to
fool with, bro. [Walks down to
Pat]. Holy shit, look at you! You
are fit! You look absolutely
amazing. You feel good?
PAT
How you doing, Jake?
JAKE
Good. You look like Schwarzenegger in his prime.
DOLORES
Didn't I say you wouldn't recognize him?
JAKE
So, listen, I’m sorry that I didn’t come see you down at the hospital. You know how those places creep me out, and the firm’s been expanding. I’ve been helping Pop with the restaurant ‘cause he needs to have a legitimate business. He needs a tax return. With all the money that he’s making with his bookmaking, they’re gonna come after him. And then it looks like I’m making, I’m gonna make partner at the firm.
Pat just stares at Jake. The room is silent.
JAKE (CONT’D)
Well, I don’t even know what to say to you anymore. You lost your wife, I’m getting engaged, and I wanna be able to tell you about those kind of things. You lost your house, I’m getting a new house. You lost your job, things are going great for me at the firm.
94.
PAT SR.
Maybe stop talking about all the
stuff that’s good for you and bad
for him. Just, you know, leave it
alone. We’re watching the game.
JAKE
You know what, I’m just gonna, I’m just gonna, I’m just gonna stop talking. I’m gonna shut my mouth.
Pat stares down Jake. Tense.
PAT
As my friend Danny would say 00
The room hangs on Pat’s words.
PAT (CONT’D)
I got nothing but love for you,
brother.
PAT SMILES. TENSION EASES. PAT AND JAKE EMBRACE.
DANNY
That’s right. That’s right.
RONNIE/RANDY/DANNY/DELORES	(O.C.)
That’s nice. That’s nice.
DOLORES INHALES TEARFULLY.
PAT SR.
Well, thank God, finally.
PAT
DeSean Jackson.
JAKE
Yeah. Did it fit?
PAT
I wore it to Ronnie’s for dinner.
RONNIE
Beautiful jersey. I love that
jersey.
PAT
Veronica didn’t like it.
RONNIE
Veronica hates the jersey.
JAKE
Whatever you do, watch out	for
that restraining order, okay?
95.
JAKE PATS PAT’S CHEST AND WALKS TO SOFA.
PAT
I’m not doing anything!
RONNIE
Don't let Tiffany get you in
trouble.
DOLORES
Pat, you’re up to something, I
know.
PAT
People like Tiffany, or Danny, or me, maybe we know something that you guys don’t know, okay? Did you ever think about that? Maybe we understand something because we’re more--
DOORBELL RINGS.
DANNY
We have a sixth sense. I mean,
everybody’s got it. Everybody’s
just not in touch with it.
OFFICER KEOGH STANDS WITH MALE ORDERLIES FROM THE PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL.
DOLORES
Oh, no.
OFFICER KEOGH
How you doing, Pat?
PAT
Jesus.
PAT SR.
I guess his sixth sense forgot to
tell him the cops were coming.
OFFICER KEOGH
(re: Danny)
I’m taking him back to the
hospital.
PAT
What? No, no, he passed his thing, right?
RANDY LAUGHS
96.
DANNY
First of all, check with the latest legal development.
OFFICER KEOGH
Well, we got a call that they did convert you to a Mental Hygiene Law admission status by the deadline of your sentence, so... .
PAT SR.
(to Keogh)
Wait a minute. Are you an Eagles
fan or are you not an Eagles fan?
OFFICER KEOGH
I’m an Eagles fan.
PAT SR.
Well then, what’s the problem? He’s not goin’ anywhere. Just let him finish the game, that’s all. The handkerchief is working. We’re killing the Seahawks, twenty-seven-ten. What’s the matter with you? Let him stay, please!
OFFICER KEOGH
I don’t know what the hell you’re talking about “the handkerchief”. And I’m glad that the Seahawks are losing and we’re winning, but I gotta take Danny McDaniels back to Baltimore, alright? He can contest his case from Baltimore.
DANNY STANDS UP.
DANNY
Not correct about the Mental
Hygiene Law. You’re not correct.
OFFICER KEOGH
Come on.
DANNY ENTERS R. AND OFFICER KEOGH GRABS HIS ARM. THE ORDERLIES AND OFFICER KEOGH ESCORT DANNY L. THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR.
DANNY
You guys oughta be ashamed of
yourselves.

PAT WAVES.
INT. TIFFANY’S GARAGE/DANCE STUDIO - DAY
TIFFANY LEADS PAT INTO HER DANE STUDIO.
TIFFANY
I used the insurance money to build this. I designed it. All the floors are hard oak. It has good bounce for dancers.
PAT
Wow.
TIFFANY
I’m not that great of a dancer, but who cares? It’s therapy and it’s fun. And the walls are good ‘cause I can play music really loud without anybody hearing.
PAT
Where do you sleep?
TIFFANY GESTURES AT A STAIRCASE.
TIFFANY
Upstairs. It's a garage, I just
renovated it. You know, I was
thinking about putting a ballet
barre here.
PAT
When are you gonna give it to her?
TIFFANY
What?
PAT
The letter to Nikki.
PAT HOLDS UP THE ENVELOPE.
TIFFANY
Probably tonight.
PAT
Really?
98.
TIFFANY
Ronnie and Veronica and I are gonna see her tonight.
PAT
Oh, I actually changed the first
paragraph. I did this thing about
Shakespeare and how it’s very
romantic-
TIFFANY
Mm-hmm.
PAT
-and that maybe in the future if she wanted to go dancing, I can be able to do that because of all the training that--
TIFFANY
(interrupting)
No, that’s good, that’s really
good.
PAT
I assume you’re a good teacher.
TIFFANY’S HAND TAKES THE ENVELOPE FROM PAT.
TIFFANY
Yeah. I mean, I hope so.
PAT
Maybe you can teach us both, you
know what I mean?
TIFFANY EXITS AND PLACES THE ENVELOPE ON THE STAIRCASE. PAT  (CONT’D)
And I also mentioned how generous
it is, what I’m doing for you.
TIFFANY
Yeah. Mm-hmm. It’s really generous.
PAT
You know, being of service.
TIFFANY
Yeah.
PAT
To your need.
TIFFANY
Uh-huh.
99.
TIFFANY (CONT’D)
All right, let’s start simple.
Start at that corner, walk towards
me. Walk across the room.
Pat stands in the corner, doesn’t move.
PAT
Can we do something else besides
the dance deal?
TIFFANY
Are you fucking kidding me?
PAT
I’m good with a hammer. You want me to fix something?
TIFFANY
A deal is a deal.
PAT
I know. Okay. I was just suggesting that maybe there’s a better scenario.
TIFFANY
Why don’t you walk towards me like I’m Nikki. And the only way to convey how much you’ve missed me is by your walk. By your slow walk. You can’t talk.
PAT
I’m not doing it.
TIFFANY
Only walk. Do it.
PAT
No. That’s stupid.
TIFFANY
No walk, no letter. Walk to me like
I’m Nikki, come on. Do it. I’m
Nikki. Come on.
PAT
(under his breath)
You’re not Nikki.
PAT RELUCTANTLY WALKS.
TIFFANY
Don’t look up until you’re halfway here.
100.
PAT WALKS SLOWLY. CAMERA TILTS UP ONTO HIS FACE AS HE KEEPS HIS HEAD DOWN.
TIFFANY	(CONT’D)
That’s right.
PAT WALKS TO HER.
TIFFANY (CONT’D)
Not yet.
PAT AS HE STOPS FACE TO FACE WITH TIFFANY AND LOOKS HER IN THE EYES.
TIFFANY	(CONT’D)
Yes. Do you feel that? That’s
emotion.
PAT
I don’t feel anything.
TIFFANY
Has anybody ever told you how Tommy died?
PAT
No.
TIFFANY
We were married for three years and five days, and I loved him. But for the last couple months, I just wasn't into sex at all. It just felt like we were so different and I was depressed. Some of that is just me, some of it was he wanted me to have kids and I have a hard enough time taking care of myself. I don’t think that makes me a criminal. Anyway one night after dinner, he drove to Victoria's Secret at King of Prussia Mall and got some lingerie to get something going. And on the way back, he stopped on 76 to help a guy with a flat tire and he got hit by a car and killed. And the Victoria's Secret box was still in the front seat. (pause) That's a feeling.
PAT, VISIBLY UPSET, WATCHES AS TIFFANY TURNS TO HER IPOD. BOB DYLAN’S “GIRL FROM NORTH COUNTRY” DUET WITH JOHNNY CASH STARTS.

THROUGH THE DOORWAY, PAT SR. LISTENS.
PAT	(CONT’D)
-all this Eagles information.
DOLORES
It’s his living.

Um, tell Dad thanks.

Football stays out of this place,
so does “Lord of the Flies.”
PAT
Wait, wait, no, no, no, what are
you doing? I'm behind on my

I don’t give a fuck.

PAT (O.S.)
Hey, hey!
INT. TIFFANY’S GARAGE/DANCE STUDIO - DAY
PAT
Did you just throw that outside?
TIFFANY
What? You’re not gonna read that shit on my time. I can tell you all about the “Lord of the Flies.” It’s a bunch of boys on an island and they have a conch -- they have a shell -- and whoever has the conch has the power and they can talk. And if you don’t have the conch, then you don’t have the power. And then there’s a little chubby boy, and they call him Piggy and they’re really mean, and then there’s a murder. I mean, humanity is just nasty and there’s no silver lining.
PAT
Wow. That was a great synopsis. I
still need to read it, though.
A KNOCK AT THE DOOR.
PAT	(CONT’D)
Who’s that?
PAT OPENS THE DOOR.

What the... .? (laughing) What are
you doing here, man?
DANNY WALKS INTO THE ROOM.
DANNY
If one of your two supervising
physicians loses their license,
then your whole ajudication is
thrown out.
PAT
How’d you know we were here?
DANNY
I went by your parents’ house
looking for you and they told me
you was over here.
PAT
Danny, this is Tiffany. (to
Tiffany) Tiffany, this is Danny.
TIFFANY
Hello. Pat told me about you.
DANNY
So is the girl, that you wrote
about?
PAT
Yeah.
TIFFANY
What? He wrote about me? I’m “the
girl”?
DANNY
He wrote about you, all right.
TIFFANY
What’d he say?
DANNY
He said you guys was helping each other out and you were nice and had a mouth on you, that you were mouthy, but--
PAT
Whoa, whoa, that’s enough.
TIFFANY
No, please, tell me more about what he said in the letter.
105.
PAT
Yeah, anything you wanna know, I’ll just tell you. It was nothing. It was just a very general letter.
TIFFANY
Cool.
DANNY
(looks at Tiffany)
She’s fine.
PAT
She is my friend with an “F.”
DANNY
A capital “F.”
PAT
For “friend.”
The three stand there awkwardly for a beat.
DANNY
Hey, can I see what you guys are
doing?
PAT
Yeah.
TIFFANY
Okay.
SHE TURNS ON MUSIC: PAT AND TIFFANY DANCE SIDE BY SIDE.
TIFFANY (CONT’D)
And then this goes into something
else.
DANNY
That’s it?
PAT
Why? What is it, what is it, what
is it.
DANNY
Can I say something? Do you mind?
TIFFANY
No.
DANNY
You sure?
PAT
Just say it. Say it.
106.
TIFFANY
No, please.
DANNY
I think Pat, you should be facing
Tiffany.
DANNY STEPS TO PAT AND TIFFANY, REMOVING HIS JACKET.
DANNY (CONT’D)
Let me show you, Pat, let me show you what I mean. You gotta come at her with a little bit more soul, man.
HE HANDS HIS JACKET TO PAT AND FACES TIFFANY.
DANNY (CONT’D)
(to Tiffany)
You should move more hips.
TIFFANY AND DANNY. PAT WATCHES, STANDING BEHIND DANNY.
DANNY (CONT’D)
(to Pat)
Just, just sort of come in, Pat,
come in like this. And... .
DANNY DANCES, DEMONSTRATING.
PAT
Okay.
DANNY
Yeah. Can you move ‘em a little bit more? Yeah, that’s it. Move ‘em a bit more.
PAST DANNY, TO TIFFANY AS SHE DANCES. TIFFANY CHUCKLES
DANNY	(CONT’D)

Come on, Pat, come on. A little bit more soul. Black it up, Pat.
PAT
“Black it up”?
DANNY

Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute,
wait a minute. Oh, man! I got an
idea.

DANNY (CONT’D)
I gotta get out of here. I gotta go see this girl, Tanya. She lives on this side of town.
PAT
Yeah, go see Tanya. Good idea.
DANNY
Okay, man, hey. I’m gonna be there, man. I want you guys to win!
TIFFANY
Bye!
108.
DANNY
Excelsior, Pat!
PAT
Excelsior!
DANNY
That’s my man.
DANNY EXITS.

INT. SOLATANO HOUSE/ATTIC - MORNING PAT, ASLEEP IN BED.
PAT SR. WALKS INTO THE ATTIC. HE SITS DOWN ON THE BED NEXT TO PAT.
PAT SR. TOUCHES PAT’S SHOULDER.
PAT SR.
Hey. Patty.
PAT WAKES.
PAT SR. (CONT’D)
Pat.
PAT SR. (CONT’D)
Patty. Where have you been? Huh?
PAT GROANS.
PAT SR. (CONT’D)
We got a serious situation on our
hands, you know that.
Pat looks concerned, he could be in trouble.
PAT SR. (CONT’D)
We gotta beat the Giants if we wanna have a chance of getting into the division, any chance of playing in the playoffs. Do you realize that?
PAT
I didn’t realize that.
109.
PAT SR.
Yeah, that’s the bind we’re in. I
mean, I think it would be wise if
we spent father-son time, reading
about the Eagles, talking about
them, just to strengthen the good
luck thing that you’re in.
PAT
Okay.
PAT SR.
Yeah?
PAT
Right.
PAT SR.
Hmm?
PAT SR. LOOKS AWAY.
PAT SR. (CONT’D)
I just wanted to, maybe I didn’t, spend enough time with you growing up. I spent too much time with your brother. It might have made you feel worse about your behavior, but I didn’t know anything, I didn’t know how to handle it. I mean, that's what all this Eagles stuff is about. It’s about us, spending time now. I wanna do everything I can to help you get back on your feet. That’s the whole point. Yeah. I wish you'd watch these games with me so we could talk, we could get into things. (inhales) So would you, would you just come downstairs and talk to me and Randy now?
PAT SR. TOUCHES PAT’S CHEEK. PAT, MOVED,	NODS.
INT. SOLATANO HOUSE/KITCHEN - MORNING
RANDY SITS AT THE TABLE, DRINKING COFFEE.
PAT SR.
Randy, tell him what I'm doing.
RANDY
He's betting everything on the
Giant game. Everything.
110.
RANDY	(CONT’D)
All the money that he needs for the restaurant, he’s betting on the Giant game.
PAT SR.
Tell him why.
RANDY
Because he believes in you.
PAT
Is that true?
PAT SR.
I believe in you, Patty. I believe in you. I want you to know that. So I'm gonna bet heavy on this game.
DOLORES STARES INTENSELY AT PAT.
PAT SR.	(CONT’D)
You understand?
PAT
Yeah.
PAT SR.
Heavy. I want you to go to the game with your brother.
PAT
You want me to go to the game with
Jake?
PAT SR.
Of course I do.
JAKE
Does he want me to go?
PAT SR.
Of course he wants you to go.
PAT
He told you that?
PAT SR.
He told me, yes.
PAT
Even with all his friends?
PAT SR.
With all his friends. He trusts
you.
111.
PAT
He’s not embarrassed?
PAT SR.
No. I'd love to go to the game, too, but as you know, I'm banned from the stadium. ‘Cause I’d love to see us beat the Giants and take a lot of money from this asshole.
RANDY
Listen, personally, I think it’s a stupid bet. As a matter of fact, I think it’s ridiculous to bet all that dough for the restaurant on a game.
PAT SR.
Randy. (to Pat) I just hope you heard what I said. It’s like a family business, it’s our family endeavor. We all stick together on this. That’s how it works. That’s a positive, positive vibe.
PAT
I made a commitment to Tiffany about a project, and we have a very important part of it that we have to go over on Sunday, and it’s good for me, Dad. It’s making me disciplined and focused, and it’s, it’s--, I never would’ve thought this, but it’s a good thing.
PAT SR.
What is this thing you're doing?
DOLORES
Yeah, what is it? What is this
project, hon?
PAT
It's a dance thing, okay? There’s
nothing more to it, Dad. I swear.
DOLORES STEPS TO PAT, KISSES HIS FOREHEAD.
