INT. TIFFANY’S GARAGE/DANCE STUDIO - DAY TIFFANY AND PAT.
PAT
Listen, I need to ask you
something.
(MORE)
112.
PAT	(CONT'D)
Tomorrow can I spend half the day
with you and half the day at the
Eagles game?
TIFFANY
I'm gonna pretend that you didn't
just ask me that.
PAT
Why?
TIFFANY
These are the two days that you have promised me and that we have prepared to nail the big move. It’s not ready yet. And we don’t have a move yet.
PAT
I know, but my dad opened up to me and it was really beautiful and I wanna be of service to him, okay?
And he’s worried that the juju from the Eagles is being fucked up and he’s concerned that it’s because I’m spending time with you.
TIFFANY
Oh, I messed up the Eagles’ juju?
PAT
No, you’re not messing up the juju, but the juju is messed up because I’m not with him during the games.
TIFFANY
Guess what?
PAT
What?
TIFFANY
Nikki replied to your letter.
TIFFANY STEPS TO THE STAIRCASE, LIFTING AN ENVELOPE.
TIFFANY (CONT’D)
(interrupting)
But you can’t read it until after
you nail the big move. Go.
PAT SIGHS AS SHE TURNS SHARPLY, PLACES THE ENVELOPE ON THE STAIRCASE AGAIN. CUT TO:
PAT BRACES HIMSELF AT FAR SIDE OF STUDIO TO CATCH TIFFANY’S BIG LEAP -- TIFFANY BRACES HERSELF TO RUN -- SHE RUNS -- LEAPS -- THE FALL. THEY DO IT AGAIN, SAME RESULTS.
113.
PAT
Tiff, I’m sorry. I can’t do anything else without reading Nikki’s letter, okay? It’s just--, it’s in the back of my head. We don’t almost have it, all right?
TIFFANY
I just hope you can handle it.
PAT
Thank you.
TIFFANY PICKS UP THE ENVELOPE AND TURNS.
PAT (CONT’D)
What was her energy when she gave
it to you?
TIFFANY
She was intrigued, excited, and a
little scared.
PAT
She was scared? About what? Did she tell you?
PAT TAKES THE ENVELOPE.
CAMERA TILTS DOWN ONTO HIS HANDS, OPENING THE ENVELOPE.
TIFFANY
Try to stay positive.
PAT’S HANDS UNFOLD THE TYPED LETTER.
PAT
I’m just gonna read it out loud, okay? Because if she says anything that’s, you know, is that too much to ask?
TIFFANY
No.
PAT LOOKS DOWN AT THE LETTER, READING SILENTLY.
TIFFANY (CONT’D)
I thought you were gonna read it
out loud.
PAT
Okay. Sorry.
(reading)
(MORE)
114.
PAT	(CONT'D)
"Dear Pat, It was very emotional for me to get your letter, as I'm sure you can imagine, but I'm glad you took the risk of discreetly getting it to me through Tiffany. This gives us a chance to communicate while I keep the restraining order until I feel safe. I must admit you sound terrific and I'm happy that you are feeling so positive and becoming a more loving and caring man, which I always knew you were. I was moved to read about ‘Excelsior’ and your belief in happy endings. I am also moved by your act of love to read the books I have taught at the high school. I'm sorry you find them so negative, but I disagree. I think they are great works of art that reflect how hard life can be and they can also help kids prepare themselves for the hardness of life. In spite of all these positive developments, Pat, I have to say if it's me reading the signs, I need to see something to prove you are ready to resume our marriage. Otherwise I find myself thinking that we might both be better off moving on with our lives separately. Please don't react quickly to this, but take time to think about it. I'm glad you're doing so well. Love, Nikki.”
PAT FOLDS UP THE LETTER AGAIN. He is kind of crying.
PAT	(CONT’D)
I think I’m done for today, okay?
TIFFANY
(follows him to door)
She said to show her something,
Pat. This dance can be that
something. You would have never
done something like this in a
million years. It shows all kinds
of skills on so many different
levels: focus, collaboration,
discipline. It's romantic, like I
said it would be. It’s for her.
PAT
(over his shoulder)
Thanks for the letter. I’ll see you tomorrow, okay?

PAT AND PAT SR.
PAT
Can I use your phone?
PAT SR.
Is it an emergency?
PAT
Yeah, kind of.
PAT SR.
What kind of emergency?
PAT
Well, I’m just doing this project
with Tiffany and I wanted to tell
her I’m not gonna be on time.
PAT SR.
Just don’t make her an emergency,
that crazy girl, you know?
PAT
She’s not crazy -- I’ll just borrow Jake’s phone. It’s too bad you can’t come in to the stadium, but I know you were kicked out, you know, for beating everybody up. Guess we’re not that different, huh, Dad?
PAT SR.
That a bad thing?
PAT
No, I think, it’s a good thing.
PAT SR. SLOWS THE CAR AND PARKS AT THE CURB.

DR. PATEL
You know, we must beat the Giants, my brother.
PAT
I’m not supposed to be seeing you, right? Outside the office?
DR. PATEL
Pat, Pat.
PAT
That’s illegal!
DR. PATEL
Pat, today I’m your brother in
green, not your therapist. I’m so
happy to see you. How wonderful
that you are here!
118.
PAT
Hey, Jake this is Cliff. This is my doctor, Cliff.
JAKE
Look, two things. We gotta watch that bubble screen for fuckin’ Manning in the backfield and we gotta make sure we knock the receivers on their ass on the line of scrimmage.
DR. PATEL
You can say that again. Those
cocksuckers!
DR. PATEL, PAT and JAKE LAUGH.

RONNIE MOVES IN FRONT OF THE CROWD, SHAKING HIS FIST.
RONNIE
Okay, you know what? I don’t have
her phone number. If you want, if
you really want, you can call
Veronica ‘cause she does, but I
don’t want to talk to Veronica.
PAT
Why don’t you wanna talk to
Veronica?
RONNIE
Because she brings me down, man!
She just brings me down.
PAT
You have to change. You’re not gonna throw the marriage away. There’s some kind of love there. I know, I used to see it.
PAT (CONT’D)
You guys have a beautiful thing that got broken somewhere along the line and you gotta fix it like a chiropractor. You gotta give it a chiropractic adjustment.
119.
RONNIE CHUCKLES
PAT	(CONT’D)
Enough with awkwardness! I don’t wanna walk in your house and not be able to say what I wanna say.
RONNIE
You’re right, man. You’re right, you’re right, you’re right, you’re right, man.

Dad--
PAT SR.
(interrupting)
What the fuck happened?
PAT
Dad.
PAT. DR. PATEL, RONNIE AND JAKE STAND BEHIND HIM.
PAT SR.
The birds lose, I lose a fuckin’ fortune, a fortune to Randy! What the fuck did you do?! You fucking lost it! I thought you said you had it together! You were solid!
PAT
I am solid. I was solid at the
game, Dad. I'm solid, I'm solid
now.
PAT SR.
You fell apart! What are you
fucking talking about?!
DR. PATEL
Your son was trying to--
PAT SR.
It's all fucking ruined now. It's
all ruined.

PAT
No, Dad, Dad, Dad, don’t!

THE GROUP WATCHES AS TIFFANY WALKS INTO THE ROOM.
PAT SR.	(CONT’D)
Who is this?! Who’s this?!
TIFFANY WALKS TO PAT.
TIFFANY
We need to talk right now! When you make a serious commitment to somebody, it is not cool to not show up!
PAT
Wait a second, I tried to call, my God, what’s happening, I called--, but I tried to call you, Tiffany, I--
PAT SR.
Who is this? What is this?
TIFFANY
Oh, really?
123.
PAT
Yes.
PAT	(CONT’D)
I told you I was gonna split my
time with my dad and you, and my
dad was pulling me in one
direction. Doctor Patel, Ronnie--
TIFFANY
Well, that sounds great, Pat.
That’s great for all of them, but
all of them didn’t make a
commitment to me in return for my
help. I'm Tiffany, by the way.
PAT SR.
What is this craziness with Tiffany
Maxwell?
PAT
There’s no craziness. I told you who she was, I was doing this thing with her. We had a conversation!
PAT SR.
She’s fucking nuts! When you started spending time with her, it all fell apart. This is the fucking reason right here.
TIFFANY
You think I fucked up the Eagles’
juju, don’t you?
PAT SR.
Ever since, ever since he was with you, ever since--
TIFFANY
(interrupting)
You think that I’m why today’s
happened?
PAT SR.
That’s right, you are why today
happened.
TIFFANY
I’m the reason why today happened?
PAT SR.
I think so.
TIFFANY
Let’s talk about that.
124.
PAT SR.
Be my guest.
TIFFANY
The first night that Pat and I met at my sister's, the Eagles beat the Forty Niners handily, forty to twenty-six. The second time we got together we went for a run and the Phillies beat the Dodgers seven to five in the NLCS.
JAKE
She’s right, Dad.
TIFFANY
The next time we went for a run the Eagles beat the Falcons, twenty-seven to fourteen.
PAT
Wow.
TIFFANY
The third time we got together we had Raisin Bran in the diner and the Phillies dominated Tampa Bay in the fourth game of the World Series, ten to two.
PAT
Oh, wow.
PAT SR.
Let me think about that. Wait a
minute.
TIFFANY
Well, why don’t you think about when the Eagles beat the Seahawks, fourteen to seven.
PAT SR.
He was with you?
TIFFANY
He was with me. We went for a run.
RONNIE
Really? That’s crazy.
125.
TIFFANY
There have been no games since Pat and I have been rehearsing every day and if Pat had been with me like he was supposed to, he wouldn't have gotten in a fight, he wouldn't be in trouble, maybe the Eagles beat the New York Giants.
JAKE
She’s making a lot of sense, Pop.
That’s all right on all counts.
TIFFANY
Does anybody here happen to know what the official motto of the state of New York is on the official seal of the State of New York? Huh? Anybody? (to Pat Sr.) Do you? Do you know? “Excelsior.” Look it up. Yeah, “Excelsior.”
DOLORES
Oh Pat.
TIFFANY
Not that I give a fuck about football or about your superstitions, but if it's me reading the signs, I don't send the Eagles guy whose personal motto is “Excelsior,” to a fucking Giants game, especially when he's already in a legal situation.
RONNIE
Unbelievable.
PAT
Wow. How did you know all that
stuff?
TIFFANY
I did my research.
SHE SNAPS OFF A BEER BOTTLE CAP AND DRINKS.
PAT SR.
Well, I gotta say, I’m impressed.
TIFFANY
Thank you.
PAT SR.
I gotta rethink this whole thing. I didn’t trust it before, but I gotta say, now I do.
126.
PAT
Oh, now you like her, Dad?
PAT SR.
I have to say I do. Yup.
RANDY
Patrizio, I feel terrible, you know? You made the bet, I won a lot of money, and now look, your whole family is in turmoil.
TIFFANY
Oh, fuck off, Randy. You love it. You live for this shit. You've been betting against my father for years.
PAT
Is that right?
TIFFANY
You're twisting the knife right
now. You get off on it!
RANDY
That’s bullshit! That’s not true!
Don’t say that!
TIFFANY
You get off on it! If not, then
prove it. Prove it.
PAT SR.
Yeah, prove it, prove it!
RANDY
How do you want me to prove it?
PAT SR.
How’s he gonna prove it?
TIFFANY
By giving them the chance to win back everything, double or nothing.
PAT
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
RANDY
Double or nothing on the Bengals,
next week? Is that what you’re
saying?
TIFFANY
No.
127.
She pauses, turns dramatically to Randy.
TIFFANY (CONT’D)
Against the Cowboys.
EVERYONE GASPS.
TIFFANY (CONT’D)
That’s your team isn’t it, Randy?
PAT
That’s his team!
TIFFANY
I know who his team is.
RANDY
When is the game?
TIFFANY
December twenty-eight, last game of the season.
PAT
Oh, my God.
TIFFANY
Same day as the Benjamin Franklin
Pairs Open Freestyle Dance
Competition.
DOLORES
Oh God.
PAT SR.
Randy, I thought they were
America's Team. Don't you believe
in America's Team?
TIFFANY
Yeah, Randy, don't you believe in
America's Team?
RANDY
Yeah, I believe in America's Team but if I win that bet, I win your book, you’re out of action, you get no restaurant, no nothing.
PAT SR.
I like it.
DOLORES
No. No, Patrizio--
128.
PAT SR.
I believe in the Eagles, I believe in my son, I’ll take the action. I’ll take it.
PAT
Dad!
DOLORES
Patrizio, don’t! It's toxic!
PAT SR.
I have faith, I have faith.
Excelsior belongs in this house--
PAT
Dad--
PAT SR.
--not in the State of New York. In this house.
PAT
Dad, listen to me. I didn’t know
that “Excelsior” was the state
motto of New York, okay?
PAT SR.
I didn’t know, either, but now I
know.
PAT
I know, but listen to me, this is toxic. Dad, Dad, Dad, this is toxic, you shouldn’t be doing this, you shouldn’t be doing--
PAT SR.
Randy, what do you say-- (to Pat) Be quiet, shut up. You already did enough. (to Randy) Randy, what do you say? My birds, Benjamin Franklin's team favored by one and a half points. I'll give you three more.
DOLORES
Patrizio, stop it! And Randy, don’t you take the bet!
PAT SR.
In fact, I'll give you ten points.
PAT
No, Dad! Dad!
129.
JAKE
Dad!
PAT SR.
You have to take that bet on the
Cowboys.
RANDY
Dolores, would you stop him?
JAKE
Jesus!
PAT SR.
How could you not take that bet? Even with the ten points I give you, that's an insane spread to your advantage. Cowboys are cowards. And I'll bet you're such a coward, you won't take the ten. Plus, are you listening, plus whatever their score is at the dance thing. (to Tiffany) What's that? Tiffany, what's that?
PAT
What? No, no, no, no.
RANDY
You’re crazy to give away that many points. That’s ridiculous! I won’t take that! However, wait a second. I do like the idea of a parlay.
DOLORES
What? No parlay! No!
PAT
No, don’t do it. Don’t do it.
RANDY
Pat, how do they run this dance
competition? I mean, how do they
score it and everything?
PAT
I don’t know, I don’t know how they fucking score! We’re participating. We’re not, we’re not a part of it. There are people, this is a high-end dance contest. I don’t know. Do not put it as part of the parlay, Randy. Don’t--
130.
TIFFANY
They go by the Philadelphia rules. Each dancer is scored on a scale of one to ten, ten being the highest. You have to average the four judges' scores.
RANDY
Okay, score is from one to ten,
right? And you guys are how good?
PAT
We suck.
TIFFANY
We don’t suck. Pat’s a beginner,
I’m okay, we’re happy just to be
going there.
RANDY
And how are the people you’re
competing against?
TIFFANY
They’re good. Some of them are
professionals.
RANDY
They’re good? Better than you?
Pause. Tiffany says nothing.
PAT
A lot better.
RANDY
A lot better. So if I was to say
you only have to score five, I
would be really very generous,
right?
PAT
No, no, that would be amazing if we got five. Let’s not get away--
TIFFANY
Oh, come on, we can get a five out of ten! Gimme a break! Gimme me a break!
PAT
We can’t get five!
PAT SR.
Give ‘em a five. Give ‘em a five.
131.
TIFFANY
We can do a five.
PAT
What are you talking about, Dad?
You haven’t even seen us dance!
RANDY
That’s the parlay.
DR. PATEL
Will somebody please explain to me the parlay? Please?
RONNIE
You gotta win two bets or you lose the whole thing. For Pat Sr. to win, the birds gotta beat the Cowboys plus Pat and Tiffany gotta get at least a five at the dance.
DR. PATEL
That’s very, very manic indeed.
RONNIE
That’s the parlay.
RANDY
Shake on it.
PAT
You know what? I’m not gonna be a part of this. (to Randy) Randy, Randy, you’re a sickness. You’re a fucking sickness, Randy. I’m out.
TIFFANY
Pat, you can’t quit.
PAT
I’m not doing the dance. I’m out.
TIFFANY
Pat, calm down. Thank about it.
PAT
See you later.
TIFFANY
Pat, no.
PAT SR.
What are you doing?
TIFFANY
Pat.
132.
PAT
(walking out)
I’m out.
PAT SR.
(follows him)
Here we are again at the one yard line. DeSean, snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. There you go.
PAT
What does that even mean, Dad? I’m not gonna make that, that, that connection that you’re making with DeSean Jackson. It doesn’t matter anymore okay? Just because I have the fucking jersey on... I’m not gonna do it. I’m sorry.
TIFFANY
You are not a stand up guy right
now. If it's me reading the
signs... if it’s me reading the
signs--
PAT
If it's you reading the signs?
You’re reading the signs? Oh, okay.
PAT STEPS THROUGH THE DOORWAY
DOLORES

You took that stupid parlay thing, and now he won’t do the dance and it was very constructive for him, and you ruined it.

It's a white lie, what’s that matter? That’s no big deal. So it’s a little lie.
TIFFANY
There’s no other way.
PAT SR.
You know, we gotta leave a trail of bread crumbs so that he can live his life without ruining it.
DOLORES
No. I don't approve. You can't do
it.
PAT SR.
Well, you know, I didn’t approve when you called her and you told her where he was running, so she could ambush him. I didn’t approve of that, but you did it anyway, so I’m doing this anyway. That’s it.
TIFFANY
We’re gonna tell him Nikki’ll be
there.
PAT SR.
(to Dolores)
You gotta be part of it.
