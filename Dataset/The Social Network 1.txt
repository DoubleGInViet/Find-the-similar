FROM THE BLACK WE HEAR--
MARK (V.O.)
Did you know there are more people with genius IQ’s living in China than there are people of any kind living in the United States?
ERICA (V.O.)
That can’t possibly be true.
MARK (V.O.)
It is.
ERICA (V.O.)
What would account for that?
MARK (V.O.)
Well, first, an awful lot of people live in China. But here’s my question:
FADE IN:
INT. CAMPUS BAR - NIGHT
MARK ZUCKERBERG is a sweet looking 19 year old whose lack of any physically intimidating attributes masks a very complicated and dangerous anger. He has trouble making eye contact and sometimes it’s hard to tell if he’s talking to you or to himself.
ERICA, also 19, is Mark’s date. She has a girl-next-door face that makes her easy to fall for. At this point in the conversation she already knows that she’d rather not be there and her politeness is about to be tested.
The scene is stark and simple.
MARK
How do you distinguish yourself in a population of people who all got 1600 on their SAT’s?
ERICA
I didn’t know they take SAT’s in China.
MARK
They don’t. I wasn’t talking about China anymore, I was talking about me.
ERICA
You got 1600?
MARK
Yes. I could sing in an a Capella group, but I can’t sing.
2.
ERICA
Does that mean you actually got nothing wrong?
MARK
I can row crew or invent a 25 dollar PC.
ERICA
Or you can get into a final club.
MARK
Or I can get into a final club.
ERICA
You know, from a woman’s perspective, sometimes not singing in an a Capella group is a good thing?
MARK
This is serious.
ERICA
On the other hand I do like guys who row crew.
MARK
(beat)
Well I can’t do that.
ERICA
I was kid--
MARK
Yes, it means I got nothing wrong on the test.
ERICA
Have you ever tried?
MARK
I’m trying right now.
ERICA
To row crew?
MARK
To get into a final club. To row crew?
No. Are you, like--whatever--delusional?
ERICA
Maybe, but sometimes you say two things at once and I’m not sure which one I’m supposed to be aiming at.
MARK
But you’ve seen guys who row crew, right?
3.
ERICA
No.
MARK
Okay, well they’re bigger than me. They’re world class athletes. And a second ago you said you like guys who row crew so I assumed you had met one.
ERICA
I guess I just meant I liked the idea of it. The way a girl likes cowboys.
MARK
(beat)
Okay.
ERICA
Should we get something to eat?
MARK
Would you like to talk about something else?
ERICA
No, it’s just since the beginning of the conversation about finals club I think I may have missed a birthday.
(can’t get over it)
There are really more people in China with genius IQ’s than the entire population of--
MARK
The Phoenix is the most diverse. The Fly Club, Roosevelt punched the Porc.
ERICA
Which one?
MARK
The Porcellian, the Porc, it’s the best of the best.
ERICA
Which Roosevelt?
MARK
Theodore.
ERICA
Is it true that they send a bus around to pick up girls who want to party with the next Fed Chairman?
MARK
You can see why it’s so important to get in.
4.
ERICA
Okay, well, which is the easiest to get into?
MARK is visibly hit by that... 
MARK
Why would you ask me that?
ERICA
I’m just asking.
MARK
None of them, that’s the point. My friend Eduardo made $300,000 betting oil futures one summer and Eduardo won’t come close to getting in. The ability to make money doesn’t impress anybody around here.
ERICA
Must be nice. He made $300,000 in a summer?
MARK
He likes meteorology.
ERICA
You said it was oil futures.
MARK
You can read the weather you can predict the price of heating oil. I think you asked me that because you think the final club that’s easiest to get into is the one where I’ll have the best chance.
ERICA
I asked--what?
MARK
You asked me which one was the easiest to get into because you think that that’s the one where I’ll have the best chance.
ERICA
The one that’s the easiest to get into would be the one where anybody has the best chance.
MARK
You didn’t ask me which one was the best one, you asked me which one was the easiest one.
ERICA
I was honestly just asking. Okay? I was just asking to ask. Mark, I’m not speaking in code.
5.
MARK
Erica--
ERICA
You’re obsessed with finals clubs. You have finals clubs OCD and you need to see someone about it who’ll prescribe you some sort of medication. You don’t care if the side effects may include blindness.
MARK
Final clubs. Not finals clubs and there’s a difference between being obsessed and being motivated.
ERICA
Yes there is.
MARK
Well you do--that was cryptic--so you do speak in code.
ERICA
I didn’t mean to be cryptic.
MARK
I’m saying I need to do something substantial in order to get the attention of the clubs.
ERICA
Why?
MARK
Because they’re exclusive. And fun and they lead to a better life.
ERICA
Teddy Roosevelt didn’t get elected president because he was a member of the Phoenix Club.
MARK
He was a member of the Porcellian and yes he did.
ERICA
Well why don’t you just concentrate on being the best you you can be?
MARK
Did you really just say that?
ERICA
(beat)
I was kidding.

6.
ERICA (CONT'D)
Although just because something’s trite it doesn’t make it any less--
MARK
I want to try to be straight forward with you and tell you that I think you might want to be a little more supportive. If I get in I’ll be taking you... to the events, and the gatherings... and you’ll be meeting a lot of people you wouldn’t normally get to meet.
ERICA
(smiles)
You would do that for me?
MARK
We’re dating.
ERICA
Okay, well I want to try and be straight forward with you and let you know that we’re not anymore.
MARK
What do you mean?
ERICA
We’re not dating anymore, I’m sorry.
MARK
Is this a joke?
ERICA
No, it’s not.
MARK
You’re breaking up with me?
ERICA
You’re going to introduce me to people I wouldn’t normally have the chance to meet? What the fff--What is that supposed to mean?
MARK
Wait, settle down.
ERICA
What is it supposed to mean?
MARK
Erica, the reason we’re able to sit here and drink right now is cause you used to sleep with the door guy.
7.
ERICA
The door guy, his name is Bobby. I did not slept with the door guy, the door guy is a friend of mine. He’s a perfectly good class of people and what part of Long Island are you from--Wimbledon?
MARK
Wait--
ERICA
I’m going back to my dorm.
MARK
Wait, wait, is this real?
ERICA
Yes.
MARK
Okay, then wait. I apologize, okay?
ERICA
I have to go study.
MARK
Erica--
ERICA
Yeah.
MARK
I’m sorry, I mean it.
ERICA
I appreciate that but--
MARK
Come on.
ERICA
--I have to study.
MARK
You don’t have to study. You don’t have to study. Let’s just talk.
ERICA
I can’t.
MARK
Why?
ERICA
Because it’s exhausting. Dating you is like dating a stairmaster.
8.
MARK
All I meant is that you’re not likely to-- currently--I wasn’t making a comment on your parents--I was just saying you go to B.U., I was stating a fact, that’s all, and if it seemed rude then of course I apologize.
ERICA
I have to go study.
MARK
You don’t have to study.
ERICA
Why do you keep saying I don’t have to study?!
MARK
Because you go to B.U.!
ERICA stares at him... 
MARK (CONT’D)
(pause)
Do you want to get some food?
ERICA
I’m sorry you’re not sufficiently
impressed with my education.
MARK
And I’m sorry I don’t have a rowboat so we’re even.
ERICA
I think we should just be friends.
MARK
I don’t want friends.
ERICA
I was being polite, I have no intention of being friends with you.
MARK
I’m under some pressure right now with my
OS class and if we could just order food
I think we should--
ERICA takes MARK’s hand and looks at him tenderly... 
ERICA

You are probably going to be a very successful computer person.

ERICA (CONT'D)
But you’re going to go through life thinking that girls don’t like you because you’re a nerd. And I want you to know, from the bottom of my heart, that that won’t be true. It’ll be because you’re an asshole.
And with that stinger, ERICA walks off we slowly push in on MARK. A fuse has just been lit.

INT. SECOND DEPOSITION ROOM - DAY
It’s MARK and his LAWYERS again but this time on the other side of the table are TYLER and CAMERON, DIVYA and their lawyer, GAGE, whose family had first-class seats on the Mayflower.
We’ll be back and forth between the two deposition rooms a lot.
CAMERON
(for the record)
Cameron Winklevoss. W-I-N-K-L-E-V-O-S-S.
Cameron’s spelled the usual way.
TYLER
(for the record)
Tyler Winklevoss. Tyler’s spelled the usual way and my last name is the same as my brother's.
CUT TO:
27.
INT. ADMINISTRATIVE HEARING ROOM - DAY
MARK stands before a panel of ADMINISTRATORS as well as COX, the systems manager who was woken up in the opening sequence.
ADMINISTRATOR
Mr. Zuckerberg, this is an Administrative Board hearing. You’re being accused of intentionally breaching security, violating copyrights, violating individual privacy by creating the website, WWW.FACEMASH.COM. You’re also charged with being in violation of university policy on distribution of digitized images. Before we begin with our questioning you’re allowed to make a statement. Would you like to do so?
MARK
(beat)
Uh... I’ve, you know--
MARK stands to address the Board. MARK (CONT’D)
I’ve already apologized in the Crimson to the ABHW, to Fuerza Latina and to any women at Harvard who might have been insulted as I take it that they were. As for any charges stemming from the breach of security, I believe I deserve some recognition from this Board.
MARK takes his seat.
ADMINISTRATOR
(pause)
I’m sorry?
MARK
Yes.
ADMINISTRATOR
I don’t understand.
MARK
Which part?
ADMINISTRATOR
You deserve recognition?
MARK
I believe I pointed out some pretty gaping holes in your system.
COX
Excuse me, may I?
28.
ADMINISTRATOR
Yes.
COX
Mr. Zuckerberg, I’m in charge of security for all computers on the Harvard network and I can assure you of its sophistication. In fact it was that level of sophistication that led us to you in less than four hours.
MARK
Four hours?
COX
Yes sir.
MARK
That would be impressive except if you’d known what you were looking for you would have seen it written on my dorm room window.
CUT TO:
INT. CORRIDOR - DAY
As the heavy wooden door from the hearing slams shut behind MARK. EDUARDO is waiting for him.
EDUARDO
So?
MARK
Six months academic probation.
They walk out onto--
EXT. QUAD - CONTINUOUS
EDUARDO
Wow, they had to make an example out of you.
MARK
(pause)
They had my blog. I shouldn’t have written the thing about the farm animals. That was stupid. I was kidding for God’s sake, doesn’t anybody have a sense of--
EDUARDO
I tried to stop you.
MARK
I know.
29.
EDUARDO
How do you do this thing where you manage to get all girls to hate us? Why did I let you--
MARK
I know.
EDUARDO
You can’t do that.
MARK
Wardo. I said I know.
CUT TO:
INT. LECTURE HALL - DAY
MARK is in his Operating Systems class. This is considered the hardest class at Harvard and MARK is one of the 50 students with their laptops open as the professor takes them through an impossibly difficult lesson.
PROFESSOR
Okay, let’s look at a sample problem: Suppose we’re given a computer with a 16-bit virtual address and a page size of 256 bytes.
A GIRL scribbles something on a piece of paper. Then hands it to the student next to her and nods that it should be passed over to MARK. While that’s happening--
PROFESSOR (CONT’D)
The system uses one-level page tables, that start at address 0x0400. Maybe you want to have DMA on your 16-bit system, who knows? The first few pages are reserved for hardware flags, etc.
MARK opens the note. It reads “U dick”.
He looks over and sees a couple of GIRLS looking at him with contempt.
PROFESSOR (CONT’D)
Assume page table entries have eight status bits.
MARK closes his laptop, gets up and starts to head out of the hall.
PROFESSOR (CONT’D)
The eight status bits would be--
(re: MARK)
And I see we have our first surrender.
(MORE)
30.
PROFESSOR (CONT’D)
Don’t worry, Mr. Zuckerberg, brighter men than you have tried and failed at this class.
MARK
(calling back)
1 valid bit, 1 modify bit, 1 reference bit and 5 permission bits.
PROFESSOR
That is correct. Does everybody see how he got there?
MARK walks out of the lecture hall and we
CUT TO:
EXT. ACADEMIC BUILDING - DAY
As MARK comes out and heads onto the quad--
CAMERON (OS)
(calling)
Mark?
CAMERON and TYLER have been waiting by the entrance.
CAMERON (CONT’D)
Are you Mark Zuckerberg?
MARK
Yeah.
CAMERON
Cameron Winklevoss.
MARK
Hi.
TYLER
Tyler Winklevoss.
MARK
(pause)
You guys related?
CAMERON
That’s good.
TYLER
That’s funny.
CAMERON
We’ve never heard that before.
31.
MARK
What can I do for you? Did I insult your girlfriends?
CAMERON
No, you didn’t insult our girl--
(to TYLER)
Actually, I don’t know.
TYLER
(to CAMERON)
We never asked.
CAMERON
We should do that. No, we have an idea we want to talk to you about. Do you have a minute?
MARK
(pause)
You guys look like you spend some time at the gym.
CAMERON
We have to.
MARK
Why?
TYLER
We row crew.
MARK
(pause--then smiles a little)
Yeah, I’ve got a minute.
CAMERON
Great.
CUT TO:
EXT. PORCELLIAN CLUB - DAY
As MARK is escorted by CAMERON and TYLER toward the club.
TYLER
You ever been inside the Porcellian?
MARK
No.
TYLER
You understand we can’t take you past the bike room ‘cause you’re not a member.
MARK
I’ve heard.
32.
INT. PORCELLIAN CLUB - DAY
The most exclusive of all the final clubs. DIVYA is sitting in the main living room with a textbook open as the heavy wooden door opens and the three of them come into the bike room.
CAMERON
Would you like a sandwich or something?
MARK
Okay.
CAMERON disappears for a moment.
DIVYA
Mark, right?
MARK is stealing a glance around the room.
MARK
Yeah.
TYLER
This is Divya Narendra, our partner.
MARK
Hi.
DIVYA
We were really impressed with Facemash and then we checked you out and you also built CourseMatch.
TYLER
I don’t know CourseMatch.
DIVYA
You go online and see what courses your friends are taking.
(to MARK)
Really smart, man.
MARK is looking at the framed black and white group pictures on the wall of old Porcellian classes. He sees a bra hanging over a lamp.
DIVYA (CONT’D)
Mark?
MARK
Yeah.
DIVYA
We were talking about CourseMatch.
MARK
It was kind of a no-brainer.
33.
CAMERON comes back in with a sandwich wrapped in cellophane.
MARK opens it on his lap and eats it uncomfortably.
DIVYA
And you invented something in high school, right?
MARK
An app for an MP3 player that recognizes your taste in music.
DIVYA
Anybody try to buy it?
MARK
Microsoft.
DIVYA
How much?
MARK
I didn’t sell it. I uploaded it for free.
DIVYA
For free?
MARK
Yeah.
DIVYA
Why?
MARK gives a short shrug that says both “I don’t know” and “Fuck you” at the same time.
CAMERON
Okay, well. We have something that we’ve been working on for a while, we think it’s great. It’s called the HarvardConnection. You create your own page. Interests, bio, friends, pics.
TYLER
And then people can go online, see your bio and request to be your--
MARK
Yeah. How’s it different from MySpace or
Friendster?
TYLER
Harvard-dot-E-D-U.
CAMERON
Harvard.edu. The most prestigious e-mail address in the country.
34.
TYLER
And the whole site’s kinda based on the idea that girls--well... 
CAMERON
Not to put anything indelicately.
DIVYA
Girls wanna get with guys who go to
Harvard.
CAMERON
Divya and my brother don’t have trouble putting things indelicately.
TYLER
The difference between what we’re talking about and MySpace or Friendster or any of those other social networking site--
MARK
--is exclusivity.
(beat)
Right?
DIVYA
Right.
TYLER
(beat)
Yes.
CAMERON
We’d love fort you to work with us, Mark. I mean, we need a gifted programmer who’s creative.
TYLER
And we know you’ve taking it in the shins.
DIVYA
The women’s groups are ready to declare a Fatwa and this could help rehabilitate your image.
MARK
(remembering what Erica said)
Wow. You’d do that for me?
DIVYA
We’d like to work with you.
CAMERON
Our first programmer graduated and went to work at Google. Our second programmer just got overwhelmed with school work.
(MORE)
35.
CAMERON (CONT'D)
We would need you to build the site and write the code and we’ll provide--
MARK
I’m in.
CAMERON
--the money. What?
MARK
I’m in.
TYLER
Awesome.
