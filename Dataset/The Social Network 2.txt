The WINKLEVOSSES and DIVYA with GAGE.
GAGE
That’s what you said?
MARK
It was three or four years ago, I don’t know what I said.

EDUARDO with GRETCHEN.
GRETCHEN
When did you come to Eduardo?
MARK
I don’t understand that question.
CUT TO:
INT. SECOND DEPOSITION ROOM - DAY
GAGE
Do you remember answering in the
affirmative?
MARK
The affirmative?
CUT TO:
36.
INT. FIRST DEPOSITION ROOM - DAY
GRETCHEN
When did you come to Eduardo with the idea for Facebook.
MARK
It was called TheFacebook then.
CUT TO:
INT. SECOND DEPOSITION ROOM - DAY
GAGE
This doesn’t need to be that difficult.
MARK
I’m currently in the middle of two different lawsuits.
GAGE
Did you answer affirmatively? When Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss and Divya Narendra asked you to build HarvardConnection, did you say yes?
MARK
I said I’d help.
CUT TO:
INT. FIRST DEPOSITION ROOM - DAY
GRETCHEN
When did you approach Mr. Saverin with the idea for TheFacebook?
MARK
I wouldn’t say I approached him.
GRETCHEN
Sy?
SY
You can answer the question.
MARK
At a party at Alpha Epsilon Pi.
GRETCHEN
What’s that?
MARK
The Jewish fraternity. It was Caribbean
Night.
CUT TO:
37.
INT. LARGE MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM - NIGHT
The hall has been converted into “Alpha Epsilon Pi Caribbean Night, 2003” and the party is about as lame as it sounds. What’s important is that this couldn’t be less like the final club party we saw at the beginning if they were playing Pin the Tail on the Donkey.
Some potted palm trees have been brought in along with a steel drum set. The man playing the steel drum set has a yarmulke bobby pinned to his thinning hair. A table with a punch bowl and assorted cookies is nearby.
EDUARDO, in baggy cargo shorts and a Hawaiian shirt buttoned up to the top, is standing with a few similarly dressed friends, including DUSTIN MOSKOVITZ and CHRIS HUGHES, in the sparsely populated room. On the other side of the room are a few girls--all Asian. One of the girls is wearing a bikini over her clothes. A television monitor has been set up with a DVD running of Niagara Falls.
EDUARDO
It’s not that guys like me are generally attracted to Asian girls. It’s that Asian girls are generally attracted to guys like me.
DUSTIN
I’m developing an algorithm to define the connection between Jewish guys and Asian girls.
EDUARDO
I don’t think it’s that complicated.
They’re hot, they’re smart, they’re not
Jewish and they can’t dance.
CHRIS
Mark’s here.
They see MARK come in and look around. EDUARDO waves him over... 
EDUARDO
(calling)
Mark.
MARK sees EDUARDO and waves him over to where he is. He wants to talk privately.
EDUARDO (CONT’D)
I’ll be right back.
EDUARDO joins MARK in the back of the room and they take up a spot next to a bay window that’s covered on the outside with ice.
38.
MARK
I think I’ve come up with something.
EDUARDO
Hang on, I’ve gotta tell you something you’re not going to believe.
MARK
What?
EDUARDO
I got punched by the Phoenix.
MARK
(beat)
Are you kidding?
EDUARDO
No. I mean it’s just the first of the four step process but they slipped the invitation under my door tonight. I go to the first punch party tomorrow and if they like me--
MARK
You got punched by the Phoenix.
EDUARDO
(pause)
It was, you know... it was probably just a diversity thing. It was just a diversity thing. I’ll just ride that horse until-- what did you want to talk to me about?
(pause)
Mark?
MARK
Yeah.
EDUARDO
You said you’ve come up with something.
It seems like MARK’s just made a small decision in his head.
MARK
(pause)
Yeah. I think I’ve come up with
something. Come outside.
EDUARDO
It’s 20 degrees outside.
39.
MARK
I can’t stare at that loop of Niagara
Falls which has nothing to do with the
Caribbean.
CUT TO:
EXT. QUAD - NIGHT
MARK and EDUARDO come outside and are immediately met by the freezing cold air.
MARK
People came to Facemash in a stampede, right?
EDUARDO
Yeah.
MARK
It wasn’t because they saw pictures of hot girls. You can go anywhere on the internet and see pictures of hot girls.
EDUARDO
Yeah.
MARK
It was because they saw pictures of girls that they knew. People want to go on the internet and check out their friends. Why not build a website that offers that?
Friends, pictures, profiles, whatever you can... visit, browse around, maybe it’s somebody you just met at a party. I’m not talking about a dating site. I’m talking about taking the entire social experience of college and putting it online.
EDUARDO
I can’t feel my legs.
MARK
I know, I’m totally psyched about this, too. But Wardo--
CUT TO:
INT. FIRST DEPOSITION ROOM - DAY
EDUARDO
“It would be exclusive”.
CUT BACK TO:
40.
EXT. QUAD - NIGHT
MARK
You’d have to know the people on the site to get past your own page. Like getting punched.
EDUARDO
That’s good, that’s new.
MARK
Wardo, it’s like a Final Club except we’re the president.
CUT TO:
INT. FIRST DEPOSITION ROOM - DAY
EDUARDO
I told him I thought it sounded great. It was a great idea. There was nothing to hack, people were going to provide their own pictures, their own information. And people had the ability to invite--or not invite--their friends to join. See, in a world where social structure was everything, that was the thing.
(beat)
It was a big project and he was going to have to write tens of thousands of lines of code so I wondered why he was coming to me and not his roommates. Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes they were programmers.
CUT TO:
EXT. QUAD - NIGHT
MARK
We’re gonna need a little start-up cash to rent the servers and get it online.
CUT TO:
INT. FIRST DEPOSITION ROOM - NIGHT
EDUARDO
That was why.
GRETCHEN
Did he offer terms?
CUT TO:
41.
EXT. QUAD - NIGHT
MARK
We’ll split it 70-30. 70 for me 30 for you for putting up the thousand dollars and handling for everything on the business end. You’re CFO.
CUT TO:
INT. FIRST DEPOSITION ROOM - DAY
GRETCHEN
And you said?
EDUARDO
I said “Let’s do it”.
GRETCHEN
Okay. Did he add anything else?
EDUARDO
Yes.
CUT TO:
EXT. QUAD - NIGHT
MARK
It probably was a diversity thing but so what?
CUT TO:
INT. FIRST DEPOSITION ROOM - DAY
GRETCHEN
Why do you think he said that?
SY
Gretchen, excuse me for interrupting but whose discovery is this?
GRETCHEN
Sy, if you’ll let me continue with my line of questioning--
SY
What are you suggesting?
MARK
They’re suggesting I was jealous of Eduardo for getting punched by the Phoenix and began a plan to screw him out of a company I hadn’t even invented yet.
42.
GRETCHEN
Were you?
SY
Gretchen--
MARK
Jealous of Eduardo?
SY
Stop typing, we’re off the record.
MARK
Ma’am, I know you’ve done your homework and so you know that money isn’t a big part of my life, but at the moment I could buy Mount Auburn Street, take the Phoenix Club and turn it into my ping pong room.
CUT TO:
EXT. QUAD - NIGHT
EDUARDO’s walking away and calls back to MARK--
EDUARDO
(calling)
I’ll let you know how the party is.
We stay on MARK for a moment longer, his wheels turning, before we
CUT TO:
INT. SECOND DEPOSITION ROOM - DAY
EDUARDO’s in different clothes and being questioned by GAGE.
GAGE
We recognize that you’re a plaintiff in one suit involving Facebook and a witness in another.
EDUARDO
Yes sir.
GAGE
At any time in the weeks prior to Mark’s telling you his idea, did he mention Tyler Winklevoss, Cameron Winklevoss, Divya Narendra or HarvardConnection?
43.
EDUARDO
Yes. He said they’d asked him to work on their site but that he’d looked at what they had and decided it wasn’t worth his time. He said even his most pathetic friends knew more about getting people interested in a website than these guys.
GAGE
“These guys” meaning my clients.
EDUARDO
Yes. He resented--Mark resented that they-- your clients, thought he needed to rehabilitate his image after Facemash but Mark didn’t want to rehabilitate anything. With Facemash he’d hacked into the Harvard computers, he’d thumbed his nose at the Ad Board, he’d gotten a lot of notoriety. Facemash did exactly what he wanted it to do.
MARK kind of nods a little to himself.
It should be noted that these depositions have an extra element of discomfort as everything is being said within a few feet of the people being talked about.
GAGE
Were you aware that while Mr. Zuckerberg was building TheFacebook he was also communicating with the plaintiffs?
EDUARDO
Not at the time I wasn’t, but it really didn’t have much to do with the Winklevoss’s dating--
TYLER
You weren’t there!
GAGE
Ty.
(to EDUARDO)
Were you aware that while Mr. Zuckerberg was building TheFacebook, he was leading the plaintiffs to believe he was building Harvard Connection?
SY
You’re offering a conclusion not found in evidence.
GAGE
We’re about to find it in evidence.

MUSIC kicks in that will tie this next section together as we

I need a dedicated Linux box running Apache with a mySQL backend. It’s gonna cost a little more money.
EDUARDO
How much more?
MARK
Two-hundred more.
EDUARDO
Do we need it?
MARK
Gotta handle the traffic.
EDUARDO
Do it.
MARK
I already did.
EDUARDO
Hey, guess what?

It’s snowing and cold as hell. EDUARDO’s now with a smaller group of prospective members, most of whom are in their underwear with a couple of them wearing pants. They’re all blue and shivering. They’re gathered around a statue of John Harvard as a senior announces--
SENIOR
As the plaque reads, this is John Harvard, founder of Harvard University in 1638. It’s also called The Statue of Three Lies. What are the three lies, Mr. Dowd?

DIVYA
Yes it was.

Fellas.
MARK
Match-dot-com for Harvard guys?

Can I continue with my deposition?
MARK
You know you really don’t need a forensic team to get to the bottom of this. If you guys were the inventors of Facebook you’d have invented Facebook.

INT. COMPUTER SCIENCE LAB - DAY
MARK is working at a station. We can see through the windows that it’s a frigid, snowy February day in Cambridge but MARK’s in his hoodie and cargo shorts nonetheless. It looks like he hasn’t slept in days. On his monitor we can see that he’s working on the profile page for theFacebook.
DUSTIN MOSKOVITZ steps up to him quietly.
DUSTIN

MARK turns his head and looks at him...

Then another.
And then another until he gets to his floor. He sprints down his hall toward his dorm room and barely notices EDUARDO leaning against the door.
EDUARDO
We were supposed to meet at 9.
MARK is searching the pockets of his shorts for his keys.
EDUARDO (CONT’D)
Have you slept yet?
MARK opens the door and they go into his suite--

MARK
I have to add something.

Shit.

That looks good.

That looks really good.
MARK
It’s clean and simple. No Disneyland, no Live Nude Girls.
The CAMERA surveys the screen as MARK slips through some functions to show EDUARDO and we see things that are now familiar--A photo, sex, a profile, a list of attributes, a poke application, etc.
MARK (CONT’D)
But watch.
MARK’s called up a the Emacs program and quickly writes out
several lines of code... 
EDUARDO
What’d you write?
MARK goes back to the profile page. There’s a new area to be
filled in... 
MARK
“Relationship Status”, “Interested In”.
(beat)
This is what drives life at college. Are you having sex or aren’t you. It’s why people take certain classes, and sit where they sit, and do what they do, and at its, um, center, you know, that’s what theFacebook is gonna be about. People are gonna log on because after all the cake and watermelon there’s a chance they’re actually gonna--

You made a masthead.
MARK
Yeah.

INT. DINING HALL - NIGHT
THE KROKODILOES, Harvard’s oldest male a Capella group, are singing at the front of the hall in their usual uniform of white tie and tails for a packed crowd of students and parents.
Incongruously, but with surprisingly nice results, the group is covering a song from All-4-One--”I Swear”--and the pub full of students is loving it.
We find a table in the back where DIVYA is sitting with his girlfriend and some of their friends who are having a nice time. Divya’s girlfriend, K.C., has her laptop open.
MALE FRIEND
What ever happened to Cole Porter and
Irving Berlin?
FEMALE FRIEND
It’s a Valentine’s theme. They’re playing love songs.
MALE FRIEND
Good point, ‘cause Cole Porter and Irving
Berlin never wrote any love songs.

DIVYA
Honey, you should put the laptop away.
K.C.
Seven different people spammed me the same link.
DIVYA
K.C.--
She clicks on the link--
FEMALE FRIEND
What is it?
K.C.

I don’t know, but I’m really hoping it’s cats that look like Hitler ‘cause I can never get enough of that.

It’s not.
DIVYA takes K.C.’s hand and turns his focus back to the singers but only for just a second because whatever was on the screen gets his attention in a hurry.
He swivels the laptop toward himself--
He starts quickly scrolling and reading it and we PUSH IN on
his face as the blood starts draining away... 
K.C. (CONT’D)
Div!

What?
DIVYA shuts the laptop, grabs it off the table-- Puts it back--
People are starting to turn and see what the commotion is about as the singing continues.
K.C. (CONT’D)
What is wrong?
DIVYA starts to bolt out of the pub. His foot gets caught on a chair leg and he falls hard face-first to the floor.
DIVYA
It’s fine.
He starts out again, then comes back for his coat, grabs it, starts out and falls down all over again.

CAMERON
(into phone)
That’s right.
DIVYA
(into cell)
I called earlier. I’m looking for Mark Zuckerberg.
CAMERON
(into phone)
Yes sir, he’s quoted a couple of times. I can read it to you, “’Everyone’s been talking a lot about a universal facebook within Harvard’, he says”--he meaning Mark--”’I think it’s kind of silly that it would take the University a couple of years to get around to it. I can do a classier job than they can and I did in a week.’”
DIVYA

Tell him Divya Narendra called, I
appreciate it.
CAMERON

I know, that’s how he talks.
DIVYA

Crimson)
“As of yesterday evening, Zuckerberg said over 650 students had registered to use theFacebook.com. He said he anticipated that 900 students would have joined the site by this morning.”

CAMERON
(into phone)
Yeah, Divya was just reading that 650 students signed up for it on the first day.
TYLER
If I were a drug dealer I couldn’t give free drugs to 650 people in one day.
DIVYA
And this guy doesn’t have three friends to rub together to make a fourth.
CAMERON
(quieting them so he can hear)
Guys, please, come on.

That’s what we’ll do, Mr. Hotchkiss. We’ll put all this together and we’ll email it to you.

You won’t be able to get on the website yourself.

Because you don’t have--a Harvard, umm-- You know what, it would just be easier for us to email it to you.

No, I’m sure you’re right, this is a good guy--

Wow!!
CAMERON

Thank you very much, and Dad--alright love you too.
CAMERON hangs up.
DIVYA
This is a good guy?
CAMERON
We don’t know that he’s not a good guy.
DIVYA
We know that he stole our idea. We know he lied to our faces for a month and a half while he--
60.
CAMERON
He never lied to our faces.
DIVYA
(DIVYA tosses the Crimson to
TYLER)
He never saw our faces! He lied to our e-mail accounts and he got himself a 42-day head start because he knows what apparently you don’t which is that getting there first is everything!
CAMERON
I’m a competitive racer, Div, I don’t think you need to school me on the importance of getting there first, thank you.
DIVYA
Alright. That was your father’s lawyer?
CAMERON
It was his in-house counsel, he’ll look at it and if he thinks it’s appropriate he’ll send a cease and desist letter.
DIVYA
What’s that gonna do?
CAMERON
What, do you wanna hire and IP lawyer and sue him?
DIVYA
No, I wanna hire the Sopranos to beat the shit out of him with a hammer.
TYLER
We don’t even have to do that.
CAMERON
That’s right.
TYLER
We can do that ourselves.
CAMERON
Hey--
TYLER
I’m six-five, 220 and there’s two of me.
DIVYA
I’m with this guy.
61.
CAMERON
And I’m saying let’s calm down until we know what we’re talking about.
DIVYA
How much more information are you waiting for? We met with Mark three times, we exchanged 52 e-mails, we can prove that he looked at the code--
(then)
What is that on the bottom of the page?
CAMERON
(he’s already seen it)
It says “A Mark Zuckerberg Production”.
DIVYA
On the home page?
TYLER
On every page.
DIVYA
Shit, I need a second to let the
classiness waft over me.
CAMERON
Look--
TYLER
Cam. They wrote, “Zuckerberg said that he hoped the privacy options would help to restore his reputation following student outrage over Facemash.com”.
(beat)
That’s exactly what WE said to him. He’s giving us the finger in the Crimson. Now while we’re waiting for Dad’s lawyer to look this stuff over, we can at least--
CAMERON
No.
TYLER
--get something going in the paper so that people know--
CAMERON
What?
TYLER
That this thing is in dispute.
CAMERON
We’re not starting a knife fight in the Crimson and we’re not suing anybody.
62.
DIVYA
Why not?
CAMERON wants to answer the question but doesn’t... 
DIVYA (CONT’D)
I don’t understand, why not?
CAMERON
(beat--referring to TYLER)
He’s gonna say it’s stupid.
TYLER
Me?
DIVYA
Say it. Why not?
CAMERON
Because we’re gentlemen of Harvard.
(beat)
This is Harvard. You don’t plant stories and you don’t sue people.
DIVYA
(pause)
You thought he was going to be the only one who thought that was stupid?

INT. SECOND DEPOSITION ROOM - DAY
GAGE
During the time when you say you had this idea, did you know Tyler and Cameron came from a family of means?
MARK
(pause)
A family of means?
GAGE
Did you know that his father was wealthy.
MARK
(pause)
I’m not sure why you’re asking me that.
GAGE
It’s not important that you be sure why
I’m asking you.
MARK
It’s not important to you.
63.
GAGE
(asking for help again)
Sy.
SY
(to MARK)
Did you know that they came from money?
MARK
I had no idea whether they came from money or not.
GAGE
In one of your e-mails to Mr. Narendra you referenced Howard Winklevoss’ consulting firm.
MARK
(beat)
If you say so.
GAGE
Howard Winklevoss founded a firm whose assets are in the hundreds of millions.
MARK
Mm-hm... 
GAGE
You also knew that Cameron and Tyler were members of a Harvard final club called the Porcellian.
MARK
They pointed that out.
TYLER
Excuse us for inviting you in.
MARK
To the bike room.
GAGE
(to TYLER)
Please.
(to MARK)
So it’s safe to say you were aware that my clients had money?
MARK
Yes.
GAGE
Let me tell you why I’m asking. I’m wondering why, if you needed a thousand dollars for an internet venture, you didn’t ask my clients for it.
(MORE)
64.
GAGE (CONT'D)
They’d demonstrated to you an interest in this kind of thing so--
MARK
I went to my friend for the money because that’s who I wanted to be partners with. Eduardo was the president of the Harvard Investors Association and he was my best friend.
GAGE
Your best friend is suing you for 600-million dollars.
MARK
I didn’t know that, tell me more.

SY
Eduardo, what happened after the initial launch?
GRETCHEN
I’m sorry, Sy, would you mind addressing him as Mr. Saverin?
SY
Gretchen, they’re best friends.
GRETCHEN
Not anymore.
SY
We already went through this on the-- nevermind. Mr. Saverin, what happened after the initial--
EDUARDO
It exploded.
CUT TO:
INT. SECOND DEPOSITION ROOM - DAY
DIVYA
Everyone on campus was using it. “Facebook me” was a common expression after two weeks.
SY
And Mark?
65.
DIVYA
Mark was the biggest thing on a campus that included 19 Nobel Laureates, 15 Pulitzer Prize winners, two future Olympians and a movie star.
SY
Who’s the movie star?
DIVYA
(pause)
Does it matter?
SY
No.
CUT TO:
EXT./EST. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
The lamps in Harvard Yard light the snow falling.
SPEAKER (VO)
The light bulb event--the inciting action-- was when he was at Out of Town News and picked up a copy of Popular Electronics that had the MITS Altair Kit on the cover.
INT. AUDITORIUM - SAME TIME
There’s a lower-level and a balcony and both are full.
MARK and EDUARDO are sitting in the second to last row of the balcony.
We’ll hear the SPEAKER but we’ll only get to see him in a slightly blurry image as our attention is on MARK and EDUARDO.
SPEAKER
It was a beautiful day and I was in my room at Radcliffe and he brought me the magazine and he said, “Look, it’s going to happen without us, we’ve got to start it now.” And so I said, “Okay, you’re right. Let’s get BASIC out there.”
He gets an appreciative LAUGH from the STUDENTS.
SPEAKER (CONT’D)
Most of you think you know the rest of the story but you may not.
(beat)
The beginnings of this industry were very humble. That kit computer on the cover of that magazine--
66.
We HEAR a little muffled giggling coming from the row behind MARK and EDUARDO. MARK is too into the speech to notice but the giggling registers as a slight annoyance on EDUARDO’s face.
SPEAKER (CONT’D)
--had an 8080 microprocessor in it, unless you paid extra for a 1K memory board, you had 256 bytes.
EDUARDO hears the giggling again and turns around.
In the row behind them and a few seats over are two beautiful Asian students--ALICE and CHRISTY. They’re a little overly made-up for a lecture. CHRISTY, the one sitting closest to EDUARDO, is wearing a short skirt with a white shirt open one button too far down the front and we can see a hint of the red bra she’s wearing underneath.
She leans forward and whispers to EDUARDO--
CHRISTY
(whispering)
Your friend--is that Mark Zuckerberg?
EDUARDO
(beat)
Uh... yes.
CHRISTY
He made theFacebook.
EDUARDO smiles a little... this has just never happened--
EDUARDO
Yeah. I mean it’s both of ours--but, yeah we--yes.
CHRISTY
(still whispering)
Cool. I’m Christy. This is Alice.
EDUARDO can’t help noticing--just because it’s in his line of sight--that down the row from the girls, someone else is pointing at them and whispering to a friend.
Then back to the girls--
EDUARDO
(whispering)
Very nice to meet you.
CHRISTY
(whispering)
Facebook me when you get home. Maybe we can all go out and grab a drink later.
67.
EDUARDO
(whispering)
Certainly. Absolutely I will do that.
EDUARDO turns back to the speaker, who MARK hasn’t taken his eyes off of--
SPEAKER
There were a number of machines that came next--the TRS-80, Apple II, Commodore Pet--
CUT TO:
EXT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
As the CROWD from the lecture spills out onto the snowy quad. EDUARDO--always in his suit--is buttoning up his overcoat as he walks and MARK zips up his hoodie.
EDUARDO
She said “Facebook me” and we can all go for a drink later. Which is stunningly great for two reasons. One, she said “Facebook me”. Right? And the other is, you know--
MARK
They want to have drinks later.
EDUARDO
Yes! Have you ever heard so many different good things packed into one regular-sized sentence?
A group of guys hustle up to MARK and EDUARDO--
STUART
Excuse me. Mark?
MARK
Yeah.
STUART
I’m Stuart Singer. I’m in your O.S. lab.
MARK
Sure.
STUART
Awesome job with theFacebook.
VIKRAM
Awesome job.
MARK
Thanks.
68.
BOB
I’m Bob.
MARK
How you doin’.
BOB
You know, I could swear he was looking at you when he said the next Bill Gates could be right in this room.
MARK
I doubt it.
BOB
I showed up late, I don’t even know who the speaker was.
MARK
(beat)
It was Bill Gates.
BOB
Shit, that makes sense.
EDUARDO
(beat)
Alright, thanks guys.
