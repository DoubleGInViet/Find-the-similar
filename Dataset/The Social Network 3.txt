As MARK and EDUARDO walk on, we leave STUART, VIKRAM and BOB in the background--with STUART and VIKRAM admonishing BOB with--
STUART/VIKRAM
(to BOB)
Are you a moron?/Are you medically stupid?/You can’t recognize Bill Gates when he’s standing in front of you for an hour?/Mark Zuckerberg now thinks we got into Harvard on a dimwit scholarship./I’m gonna get a Glock .39 and I’m going to kill you./I’m actually going to kill you/etc.

INT. MARK’S DORM ROOM - NIGHT
As the door opens and MARK and EDUARDO come into the overheated warmth of the room.
EDUARDO
It’s time to monetize the thing.
MARK
What were their names?
69.
EDUARDO
Did you hear what I said?
MARK
When?
EDUARDO
I said it’s time to monetize the site.
MARK
What does that mean?
EDUARDO
It means it’s time for the website to generate revenue.
MARK
No I know what the word means. I’m asking how do you want to do it?
EDUARDO
Advertising.
MARK
No.
EDUARDO
We’ve got 4000 members.
MARK
‘Cause theFacebook is cool. If we start installing pop-ups for Mountain Dew it’s not gonna--
EDUARDO
Well I wasn’t thinking Mountain Dew but at some point--and I’m talking as the business end of the company--the site--
MARK
We don’t even know what it is yet. We don’t know what it is, we don’t know what it can be, we don’t know what it will be. We know that it’s cool, that is a priceless asset I’m not giving it up.
EDUARDO
When will it be finished?
MARK
It won’t be finished, that’s the point.
The way fashion’s never finished.
EDUARDO
What?
70.
MARK
Fashion. Fashion is never finished.
EDUARDO
You’re talking about fashion? Really?
You?
MARK
I’m talking about the idea of it and I’m saying it’s never finished.
EDUARDO
Okay, but they manage to make money selling pants... 
EDUARDO has seen something on the top of MARK’s mantle... 
EDUARDO (CONT’D)
Mark, what is this?
MARK
What.
EDUARDO holds up a letter that’s on a lawyer’s stationary.
EDUARDO
This.
MARK
It’s called a cease and desist letter.
What were their names?
EDUARDO
Who?
MARK
The girls.
EDUARDO’s speed reading the letter.
EDUARDO
When did you get this?
MARK
About 10 days ago. Right after we
launched the site.
EDUARDO
Jesus Christ.
MARK
Hey, the girls. What were their names?
EDUARDO
They’re saying--the Winklevoss twins are saying you stole their idea.
71.
MARK
I find that to be a little more than mildly annoying.
EDUARDO
They find it to be intellectual property theft. Why--
MARK
Look--
EDUARDO
--why didn’t you show this to me?
MARK
It was addressed to me.
EDUARDO
They’re saying we stole theFacebook from
Divya Narendra and the Wink--
MARK
I know what it says.
EDUARDO
(pause)
Did we?
MARK
Did we what?
EDUARDO
Don’t screw around with me now. Look at me.
MARK looks at EDUARDO--
EDUARDO (CONT’D)
The letter says we could face legal action.
MARK
No, it says I could face legal action.
EDUARDO
It’s from a lawyer, Mark. They must feel they have some grounds for--
MARK
The lawyer is their father’s house counsel.
EDUARDO
Do they have grounds?
72.
MARK
The grounds are our thing is cool and popular and HarvardConnection is lame. Wardo, I didn’t use any of their code, I promise I didn’t use anything. A guy who builds a really nice chair doesn’t owe money to everyone who has ever built a chair. They came to me with an idea, I had a better one.
EDUARDO
Why didn’t you show me the letter?
MARK
I didn’t think it was a big deal.
EDUARDO
If there’s something wrong--if there’s ever anything wrong--you can tell me. I’m the guy that wants to help. This is our thing.
(pause)
Is there anything you need to tell me?
MARK
No.
EDUARDO
What are we doing about this?
MARK
I went to a 3-L at Student Legal Services and he told me to write them back.
EDUARDO
What did you say?

I’d raised concerns before.
DIVYA/TYLER (NOT CAMERON)
Bullshit./Not to us.
GAGE
(quieting)
Gentlemen.
(back to MARK)
I’m talking about at the meeting in January to which this letter is referring.
MARK
Yeah.
GAGE
Let me re-phrase this. You sent my clients 16 e-mails. In the first 15, you didn’t raise any concerns.
MARK
(beat)
Is that a question?
GAGE
In the 16th e-mail you raised concerns about the site’s functionality. Were you leading them on for six weeks?
MARK
No.
GAGE
Why hadn’t you raised any of these concerns before?
74.
MARK
(quietly)
It’s raining.
GAGE
I’m sorry?
MARK
It just started raining.
GAGE
Mr. Zuckerberg, do I have your full attention?
MARK
No.
GAGE
(beat)
Do you think I deserve it?
MARK
What.
GAGE
Do you think I deserve your full
attention?
MARK
I had to swear an oath before we began this deposition and I don’t want to perjure myself so I have a legal obligation to say no.
GAGE
Okay. “No” you don’t think I deserve your attention.
MARK
I think if your clients want to sit on my shoulders and call themselves tall they have a right to give it a try. But there’s no requirement that I enjoy sitting here listening to people lie. You have part of my attention--you have the minimum amount. The rest of my attention is back at the offices of Facebook where my colleagues and I are doing things that no one in this room, including and especially your clients, are intellectually or creatively capable of doing. Did I adequately answer your condescending question?
GAGE just looks casually at MARK. MARK doesn’t meet his gaze, or the looks from DIVYA, TYLER and CAMERON...

EDUARDO

Their names were Christy and Alice. They want to have drinks tonight.
CUT TO:
INT. MEN’S ROOM - NIGHT
It’s a nice men’s room--mahogony stalls--in a nice club in Cambridge. We HEAR the thumping of the house music coming from the club.
And then one of the wooden stall doors flies open and EDUARDO is shoved in, followed by CHRISTY, who did the shoving. She’s all over him as she presses him back against the divider.
EDUARDO’s hands are sliding under CHRISTY’S white shirt and finding the red bra when they hear a noise.
Someone’s gone into the next stall.
EDUARDO
(whispering)
Shit.
CHRISTY
(whispering)
I don’t care.
CHRISTY keeps him pinned against the divider as she reaches down and unbuckles his belt.
And then he hears another noise from the stall next door. A thump against the divider. CHRISTY’s got his fly unzipped.
EDUARDO looks down at the space between the stalls. He sees a pair of Adidas flip-flops.
76.
Then the sound of moaning. Before EDUARDO has time to say anything, CHRISTY pulls her shirt open, revealing the red bra, and puts her hand down his pants as we

INT. CLUB/MEN’S ROOM - NIGHT
MARK and EDUARDO are standing guard outside the door. They’re silent but very happy.
A guy comes along to use the men’s room.
EDUARDO
Sorry. It’ll just be a minute. Some girls are freshening up in there.
CLUB GUY
(nodding a little)
Sweet.
The guy goes off.
EDUARDO taps MARK... 
EDUARDO
(beat)
We have groupies.
MARK can’t help a smile. Then he sees something... 
MARK
I’ll be right back.
EDUARDO
Mark, where you going?
(beat)
Mark?
MARK makes his way through the crowd toward a round booth. A girl is sitting there and even though her back is to MARK he can recognize her. She’s with a girlfriend and three guys.
When he makes it to the booth he says--
MARK
Erica?
ERICA, from the opening scene, turns her head and looks up to see MARK. She’s looking sexy for her Friday night on the town and the three guys she’s with are studs. A few more friends of theirs are standing around at the edges of the booth.
ERICA
(pause)
Hi.
77.
MARK
I saw you from over there. I didn’t know you came to this club a lot.
ERICA
First time.
MARK
Mine too. Could I talk to you alone for a second?
ERICA
I think I’m good right here.
MARK
I just--I’d love to talk to you alone. If we could just go someplace--
ERICA
Right here’s fine.
MARK is aware of everyone else around the booth... 
MARK
(beat)
I don’t know if you heard about this new website I launched.
ERICA
No.
MARK
TheFacebook?
ERICA
You called me a bitch on the internet,
Mark.
MARK
That’s why I wanted to talk to you. If we could just--
ERICA
On the internet.
MARK
That’s why I came over.
ERICA
Comparing women to farm animals?
MARK
I didn’t end up doing that.
78.
ERICA
It didn’t stop you from writing it. As if every thought that tumbles through your head is so clever it would be a crime for it not to be shared. The internet’s not written in pencil, Mark, it’s written in ink and you published that Erica Albright was a bitch right before you made some ignorant crack about my family’s name, my bra size and then rated women based on their “hotness”.
REGGIE (A FRIEND OF ERICA’S)
Erica, is there a problem?
ERICA
No, there’s no problem.
(pause)
You write your snide bullshit from a dark room because that’s what the angry do nowadays. I was nice to you. Don’t torture me for it.
MARK glances at the table of Erica’s friends--
MARK
(pause)
If we could just go somewhere for a minute--
ERICA
No, I don’t want to be rude to my
friends.
MARK
Okay.
ERICA
Okay. Good luck with your video game.
It was an honest mistake on ERICA’s part but a kidney punch to MARK.
MARK turns and goes and sees that EDUARDO has been standing and watching from a distance with CHRISTY.
EDUARDO
Hey, that was great. That was the right thing to do. You apologized, right?
MARK
(ignoring him)
We have to expand.
EDUARDO

What?

And MARK heads out the door.
EDUARDO watches MARK and then looks back at the girls... 
ALICE
Is he mad about something?

Once the door is closed--
MARK
We’re expanding to Yale and Columbia. Dustin, I want you to share the coding work with me. Chris, you’re going to be in charge of publicity and outreach and you can start by getting a story in the B.U. student newspaper. The Bridge.
CHRIS
They hate doing stories about Harvard.
MARK
Somebody at the newspaper will be a computer science major. Tell ‘em Mark Zuckerberg will do 10 hours of free programming.
EDUARDO
Why do you want a story in the B.U. newsp--
MARK
Because I do. Here’s the arrangement. Eduardo is CFO and owns 30% of the company. Dustin is Vice President and Head of Programming and his 5% of the company will come from my end. Chris is Director of Publicity and his compensation will depend on the amount of work he ends up doing. Any questions?
DUSTIN
Who are the girls?
EDUARDO
Christy and Alice.
DUSTIN
Hi.

CHRISTY
Hi.
ALICE
Hello.
CHRIS
Hi.
CHRISTY
Is there anything we can do?

MARYLIN

You don’t want any lunch?
MARK

No.
MARYLIN
You’re welcome to some salad.
MARK
No thank you.
MARYLIN

MARYLIN
I’m Marylin Delpy, I introduced myself--

MARYLIN
I’m a second year associate at the firm. My boss wanted me to sit in on the deposition phase.

MARYLIN (CONT’D)

MARYLIN (CONT’D)
You must really hate the Winklevoss’s.

DIVYA
I want to hire a lawyer to file for injunctive relief and get this website taken down now!
CAMERON
Look--
DIVYA
Every minute the site is up, Harvard Connection becomes less valuable. I want an injunction, I want damages, I want punitive relief and I want him dead.
CAMERON
I want those things too!
DIVYA
Then why aren’t we doing anything about it?! Because we’re gentlemen of Harvard?!
CAMERON
Because you’re not thinking about how it’ll look.
DIVYA
How’ll it look?
CAMERON
Like my brother and I are in skeleton costumes chasing the Karate Kid around a high school gym.
DIVYA
He’s violated Massachusetts state law. When he goes to Connecticut, New York and California he’ll have violated federal law. And by the way, he’s in violation of Harvard law.
CAMERON
There’s no such thing as Harvard Law.

TYLER

Wait. Yes there is.
TYLER goes to the bookshelf and pulls down a manual.
TYLER (CONT’D)
Harvard Student Handbook. Every freshman is issued one of these. Somewhere in this book it says--

You can’t get a meeting with Larry
Summers.
CAMERON
My brother and I pay tuition at this school, we carry a 3.9 GPA at this school, we’ve won trophies for this school and we’ll be rowing in the Olympics for this school. I want a meeting with the goddam president of this school.

CUT TO:
INT. A GIRL’S COLLEGE APARTMENT (PALO ALTO) - MORNING
A pretty 20 year-old co-ed, AMY, pulls a curtain open and the darkened room immediately fills with un-welcomed sunlight. AMY’s wearing nothing but a Stanford sweatshirt as a skinny 22 year-old guy who’s lying on her futon wakes up. There’s other evidence on the walls that we’re at Stanford University. There are also pieces of AMY’s clothing strewn about.
The young man on the futon is SEAN PARKER.
AMY
I’m sorry, I’m late for Bio-Chem.
SEAN
Okay.
AMY
You don’t know my name, do you?

SEAN
(off the sweatshirt)
Is it Stanford?
AMY
I should just kick your ass. How can you go to a party, meet--
SEAN
Amelia Ritter but you prefer Amy. You’re from Orinda, your father’s in commercial real estate and your mother’s 10 years sober.
AMY

What’s my major?
SEAN
Trombone.
AMY
Really?
SEAN
I remember something about a trombone.
AMY
Tu fais l'amour à la jolie fille et la mets de côté.
SEAN
French! Your major is French.
AMY
Oui. And yours?
SEAN
Mine? I don’t have one.
AMY
You haven’t declared?
SEAN
I don’t go to school.
AMY
You’re kidding?
SEAN
No.
AMY
Where did you go to school?

SEAN
William Taft Elementary for a little while.
AMY
Seriously, you’re not like 15 years old or anything are you?
SEAN
No.

You’re not like--
AMY
No. So what do you do?
SEAN
I’m an entrepreneur.
AMY
You’re unemployed.
SEAN
I wouldn’t say that.
AMY
What would you say?
SEAN
That I’m an entrepreneur.
AMY
What was your latest preneur?
SEAN
Well... I founded an internet company that let folks download and share music for free.
AMY
Kind of like Napster?
SEAN
Exactly like Napster.
AMY
What do you mean?
SEAN
I founded Napster.
AMY
Sean Parker founded Napster.

Nice to meet you.

SEAN
You just slept on Sean Parker.
AMY
You’re a zillionaire.
SEAN
Not technically.
AMY
What are you?
SEAN
Broke. There’s not a lot of money in free music. Even less when you’re being sued by everyone who’s ever been to the Grammys.
AMY
This is blowing my mind.
SEAN
I appreciate that.
AMY
I have to hop in the shower and get ready for class.
SEAN
Bio-chem, even though you’re a French major whose name is Amy.
AMY
You passed.
SEAN
I’m a hard worker.
AMY
There’s juice or anything else you can find. Help yourself.
87.
SEAN
You mind if I check my e-mail?
AMY
Go ahead.
AMY heads into the bathroom but leaves the door a little ajar.
SEAN steps over to AMY’s pink laptop and hits a key to wake it out of sleep mode.
The shower starts running in the bathroom.
The laptop springs to life and is open to something SEAN’s never seen before--a Facebook page.
He sees AMY’s picture and a short profile: Her major at Stanford, courses she’s taking, books she likes, clubs she’s a member of... 
SEAN
(calling)
Amy?
She can’t hear him in the shower.
SEAN explores around a little more. He knows his way around a computer. He sees her “friends”. Friend after friend after friend.
SEAN (CONT’D)
(almost a whisper)
Jesus.
He gets up and goes to the bathroom door--
SEAN (CONT’D)
Amy?
AMY
(calling back)
Yeah!
SEAN
Can you come out here?
AMY
(calling)
Just a second!
SEAN tries to wait but can’t--
SEAN
There’s a snake in here, Amy.
AMY
What?!

AMY grabs a towel and jumps out of the shower--
AMY (CONT’D)
Where?!
SEAN
There isn’t a snake, but I need to ask you something.
AMY
Are you kidding me?! I could have been killed!
SEAN
(beat)
How?
AMY
(beat--not sure)
By running too fast... and getting twisted in the curtain--What do you need to ask me?
SEAN
I went to check my e-mail and there’s a site open on your computer.
AMY
After you passed out last night I went on theFacebook for a little bit.
SEAN
What’s that?
AMY
TheFacebook? Stanford’s had it for like two weeks now it’s really awesome except it’s freakishly addictive. Seriously, I’m on the thing like five times a day.
SEAN
You mind if I grab a piece of paper and a pen?
AMY
Is everything okay?
SEAN
Everything’s great. I just need to find you, Mark Zuckerberg.

I’ve never been in this building before.

LARRY SUMMERS, a large man, is on the phone at his desk in his well-appointed office. A fire crackles in the sitting area and a 40-ish African-American woman, ANNE, in a pants suit is nearby going over some papers.
SUMMERS waves the boys in--
SUMMERS
(into phone)
That’s just their own stupidity, I should have been there.

Darkness is the absence of light and stupidity in that instance was the absence of me.

SUMMERS hangs up the phone--
SUMMERS (CONT’D)
Good morning.
CAMERON
Good morning, sir. I’m Cameron Winklevoss and this is my brother, Tyler.
SUMMERS reaches to the top of a pile of papers and pulls a ten-page letter off the top.
SUMMERS
And you’re here because... 
There’s silence while SUMMERS appears to read over the letter... 
SUMMERS (CONT’D)
Either one of you can answer.
CAMERON
I’m sorry, I thought you were reading the letter.
SUMMERS
I’ve read the letter.
CAMERON
We came up with an idea for a website called HarvardConnection--we’ve since changed the name to ConnectU--and Mark Zuckerberg stole that idea and--
SUMMERS
I understand. I’m asking what do you want me to do about it.
CAMERON points to a row of Harvard Student Handbooks on the bookshelf behind SUMMERS.
CAMERON
Well sir, in The Harvard Student Handbook, which is distributed to each freshman--under the heading “Standards of Conduct in the Harvard Community”--
91.
SUMMERS can’t help an agonized sigh-- CAMERON (CONT’D)
--it says, “The College expects that all students will be honest and forthcoming in their dealings with members of this community. All students are required to respect public and private ownership. Instances of theft, misappropriation--
SUMMERS
Anne?
ANNE
Yes sir.
SUMMERS
Punch me in the face.

Go ahead.
CAMERON

... or unauthorized use will result in disciplinary action. Including requirement to withdraw from the college.
SUMMERS
And you memorized that instead of doing what?
CAMERON
What my brother and I came here today to ask of you, respectfully of course, is that--
TYLER
(a little frustrated with this
bullshit)
Sir, it’s against University rules to steal from another student, plain and simple.
SUMMERS
You’ve spoken to your House Master?
CAMERON
Yes sir, and the House Master made a recommendation to the Ad Board but the Ad Board won’t see us.
SUMMERS
Have you tried dealing with the other student directly?
92.
CAMERON
Mr. Zuckerberg hasn’t been responding to any of our e-mails or phone calls for the last two weeks. He doesn’t answer when we knock on his door at Kirkland and the closest we’ve come to dealing with him face to face is when I saw him on the quad and chased him through Harvard Square.
SUMMERS
You chased him?
CAMERON
(beat)
I saw him and I know he saw me and I went after him but he disappeared.
SUMMERS
I don’t see this as a University issue.
TYLER
Of course this is a University issue. There’s a code of ethics and an honor code and he violated them both.
SUMMERS
You entered into a code of ethics with the university, not with each other.
TYLER
(beat)
I’m sorry President Summers, what you just said makes no sense to me at all.
SUMMERS
I’m devastated by that.
CAMERON
What my brother means is that if Mark Zuckerberg walked into our dorm room and stole our computer that would be a university issue, right?
SUMMERS
I really don’t know, this office doesn’t handle petty larceny.
TYLER
This isn’t petty larceny.
CAMERON
(calming)
Ty--
TYLER
This idea is potentially worth millions of dollars.
93.
SUMMERS
Millions?
CAMERON
Yes.
SUMMERS
You might be letting your imaginations run away with you.
TYLER
Sir, I honestly don’t think you’re in any position to make that call.
SUMMERS
I was U.S. Treasury Secretary, I’m in some position to make--
TYLER
Letting our imaginations run away with us is exactly what we were told to do in your freshmen address.
SUMMERS
Well I would suggest that you let your imaginations run away with you on a new project.
TYLER
You would.
SUMMERS
Yes. Everyone at Harvard is inventing something. Harvard undergraduates believe that inventing a job is better than finding a job so I’ll suggest again that the two of you come up with a new new project.
CAMERON
I’m sorry, but that’s not the point.
SUMMERS
Please arrive at the point.
CAMERON
You don’t have to be an intellectual property expert to understand the difference between right and wrong.
SUMMERS
And you’re saying that I don’t?
CAMERON
Of course I’m not saying that.
94.
TYLER
I’m saying that.
SUMMERS
Really.
CAMERON
Sir--
SUMMERS
Anne, how did they get this appointment?
ANNE
Colleagues of their father.
SUMMERS gives a quick nod--that’s what he thought.
SUMMERS
Let me tell you something, Mr. Winklevoss and... Mr. Winklevoss. Since you’re on the subject of right and wrong. This action, this meeting, the two of you being here, is wrong. It’s not worthy of Harvard.
It’s not what Harvard saw in you. You don’t get special treatment.
CAMERON
We’ve never--
TYLER
Start another project? Like we’re making a diorama for the science fair?
SUMMERS
And if you have a problem with that, Mr.
Winklevoss--
CAMERON
We’ve never asked for special treatment.
SUMMERS
--the courts are always at your disposal.
Is there anything else I can do for you?
TYLER

Well you could take the Harvard Student Handbook and shoved it up--

As CAMERON and TYLER exit, TYLER closes the door a little too hard and the brass doorknob comes off in his hand. He drops it on the SECRETARY’S desk as he exits--
TYLER
I broke your 335 year old doorknob.
CUT TO:
INT. FIRST DEPOSITION ROOM - DAY
GRETCHEN
Eduardo, spring break, you and Mr.
Zuckerberg took a trip to New York.
EDUARDO
Yes.
GRETCHEN
What was the purpose of the trip?
EDUARDO
As CFO, I’d set up some meetings with potential advertisers.
GRETCHEN
Who paid for the trip?
EDUARDO
It was paid for out of the thousand dollar account I’d set up a few months earlier.
GRETCHEN
At this point your thousand dollars was the only money that had been put into the company.
EDUARDO
Yes.
GRETCHEN
How did you feel the meetings went?
EDUARDO
They went terribly.
GRETCHEN
Why?
EDUARDO
Mark was asleep.
MARK
I wasn’t asleep.
96.
EDUARDO
Can I re-phrase my answer?
GRETCHEN
Sure.
EDUARDO
I wish he’d been asleep.
CUT TO:
INT. AD EXECUTIVE’S OFFICE - DAY
EDUARDO, in a three-piece suit, is pitching the EXECUTIVE. MARK, in his hoodie and flip-flops, is completely detached and staring at the floor.
EDUARDO
... and we’re at 29 schools now with over 75,000 members. People who go on theFacebook tend to stay on longer than almost any other site, now here’s the most impressive statistic--91% of people who try it once will come back. Now if you’ll allow me--
EXECUTIVE
Excuse me one second.
(re: MARK)
What sound is he making? Is that like a “tsk”.
MARK
It wasn’t a “tsk”, it was uh... hmm... like a glottal stop. Almost a gag reflex.
EXECUTIVE
(beat)
Guys, what is this?
CUT BACK TO:
INT. FIRST DEPOSITION ROOM - DAY
GRETCHEN
There was one more meeting scheduled for the New York trip.
EDUARDO
Yes. It was a dinner. It was set up through my girlfriend at the time.
GRETCHEN
Would you say that Mark was excited about this meeting?
97.
EDUARDO
Yes, very.
CUT TO:
INT. 66 - NIGHT
66 is a hip and trendy restaurant in Tribeca. The young crowd is drinking cocktails of all different colors and wearing Prada. We FIND EDUARDO in a three-piece suit and MARK in his hoodie and flip-flops, along with EDUARDO’s now-girlfriend, CHRISTY, sitting at a table with an empty seat waiting.
CHRISTY
They’re not gonna card us.
EDUARDO
They might.
CHRISTY
Look around.
EDUARDO
It’ll be embarrassing.
CHRISTY
(to MARK)
Tell him they’re not gonna card us.
MARK
They’re not gonna card us.
EDUARDO
Mark--
MARK
Are you gonna talk about ads again?
EDUARDO
Unless you’re the Ballet Theatre of Hartford, the purpose of a business is to make a profit.
MARK
This isn’t a business yet.
EDUARDO
That’s tough for me because my job is to-- nevermind.
MARK says nothing... 
EDUARDO (CONT’D)
(pause)
He’s 25 minutes late.
98.
MARK
He founded Napster when he was 19, he can be late.
EDUARDO
He’s not a god.
MARK
What is he?
EDUARDO
25 minutes late.
CHRISTY
I think Wardo’s jealous.
CUT BACK TO:
INT. FIRST DEPOSITION ROOM - DAY
EDUARDO
I honestly wasn’t jealous. I was nervous.
GRETCHEN
Why?
EDUARDO
I didn’t know him at all but I’d done a search and I’d asked around. He struck me as kind of a wild card.
CUT BACK TO:
INT. 66 - NIGHT
CHRISTY
Why?
EDUARDO
He crashed out of two pretty big internet companies in spectacular fashion and he’s had a reputation with drugs.
MARK
He also founded the companies.
EDUARDO
We don’t need him.
MARK
(nodding toward the door)
He’s here.
SEAN PARKER has stepped into the restaurant and is saying hello to the hostess while hugging a waitress.
99.
EDUARDO
And he does own a watch.
SEAN stops at a table to shake hands with a guy in a suit and kiss his girlfriend. It’s sort of an incongruous sight--this 22 year old kid who’s able to work a room like Sinatra. Who the hell is this?
EDUARDO (CONT’D)
(quietly)
Take your time. And he does own a watch.
CHRISTY
Stop it.
SEAN makes his way over to MARK’s table--
SEAN
I’m Sean Parker.
EDUARDO
(shaking hands)
How do you do.
SEAN
You must be Eduardo. And Christy. And
Mark, it’s great to meet you.
MARK
(almost beaming)
Great to meet you.
SEAN
You guys don’t have anything in front of you.
(to a passing WAITRESS)
Tori.
EDUARDO
We were waiting for--
WAITRESS
Hey baby boy.
SEAN
Can you bring out some things. The lacquered pork with that ginger confit? Tuna tartar and a lobster claws, that’ll get us started. Christy, what do you like to drink?
CHRISTY
An appletini?
100.
SEAN
Great. Four of those.
CUT TO:
INT. FIRST DEPOSITION ROOM - DAY
EDUARDO
From that point on it was the Sean-a-thon.
SY
The question was “What did you talk about?”
EDUARDO
He took us through his episode with
Napster.
CUT TO:
INT. 66 - NIGHT
The CAMERA is moving around the table as SEAN--in and out of MOS--is telling story after story while food is brought, drinks put down, more food brought and more drinks put down. MARK is enthralled, CHRISTY is sexy and EDUARDO is polite.
SEAN
I didn’t want to spend my 20’s as a professional defendant. Who knew--the music industry doesn’t have a sense of humor. We tried to sell the company to pay the 35 million they said we owed in royalties but I guess to them that was a little like selling a stolen car to pay for the stolen gas. So we said screw it and declared bankruptcy.
CHRISTY
But you made a name for yourself.
SEAN
And you are dry. Tori?
CHRISTY
No, I’m good.
INT. FIRST DEPOSITION ROOM - DAY
EDUARDO (V.O.)
And then he went on to his second business venture, which was an online rolodex that he got thrown out of by Case Equity.
101.
INT. 66 - NIGHT
SEAN
And I wanted to do it nice this time. I put on a tie and I shined my shoes but nobody wants to take orders from a kid so let me tell you what happens to a 20 year old at the top of a hot dot com:
CUT BACK TO:
INT. FIRST DEPOSITION ROOM - DAY
EDUARDO
I’m not a psychiatrist, but--
SY
I’m glad we’ve got that on the record.
GRETCHEN
You’re not a psychiatrist but what?
EDUARDO
A psychiatrist would say he was paranoid.
CUT BACK TO:
INT. 66 - NIGHT
SEAN
They’ll hire private detectives who’ll follow you day and night. You’re a target for high priced escorts. I can’t prove it but I know they tapped my phones. Whatever it is that’s gonna trip you up you’ve done already. Private behavior is a relic of a time gone by. And if somehow, someway, you’ve managed to live your life like the Dalai Lama then they’ll make shit up. Because they don’t want you, they want your idea and then they want you to say thank you while you-- excuse me--wipe your chin and walk away.
MARK
That’s what happened to you?
CUT BACK TO:
INT. FIRST DEPOSITION ROOM - DAY
EDUARDO
And delusional.
CUT BACK TO:
102.
INT. 66 - NIGHT
SEAN
Yes. There‘ll be payback at Case. I brought down the record companies with Napster and Case’s gonna suffer for their sins too.
EDUARDO
You didn’t bring down the record
companies. They won.
SEAN
In court.
EDUARDO
Yes.
SEAN
You want to buy a Tower Records, Eduardo?
INT. FIRST DEPOSITION ROOM - DAY
EDUARDO (V.O.)
And he told story after story about life in Silicon Valley, and parties at Stanford and down in LA, and friends who’d become millionaires, but mostly how Mark had to-- had to come to California. And then he got around to theFacebook.
INT. 66 - NIGHT
SEAN
Tell me about your progress.
EDUARDO
Well... we’re in 29 schools now and we have over 75,000 members--
SEAN
(ignoring EDUARDO and going for
MARK)
Tell me about the strategy you’re using.
MARK
Okay. For instance, we wanted Baylor in Texas but Baylor already had a social network on campus so instead of going right after them, we made a list of every school within a hundred miles--
SEAN
--and put theFacebook on those campuses first.
103.
MARK
Pretty soon all the Baylor kids were seeing their friends on our site we were in.
SEAN
That’s called the Little Big Horn, that’s smart, Mark.
EDUARDO
Thank you, it was mine.
CHRISTY
(to EDUARDO)
Easy.
EDUARDO
Settle an argument for us, would you? I say it’s time to start making money from theFacebook but Mark doesn’t want advertising. Who’s right?
SEAN
Neither of you yet. TheFacebook is cool, that’s what it’s got going for it.
MARK
Yeah.
SEAN
You don’t want to ruin it with ads because ads aren’t cool.
MARK
Exactly.
SEAN
It’s like you’re throwing the greatest party on campus and someone’s telling you it’s gotta be over at 11:00.
MARK
That’s exactly right.
SEAN
You don’t even know what the thing is yet.
MARK
I said exactly that.
SEAN
How big it can get and how far it can go. This is no time to take your chips down. A million dollars isn’t cool. You know what’s cool?
104.
EDUARDO
You?
CUT BACK TO:
INT. FIRST DEPOSITION ROOM - DAY
EDUARDO
A billion dollars.
(beat)
And that shut everybody up.
