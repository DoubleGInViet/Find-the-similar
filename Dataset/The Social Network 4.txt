And that’s where you’re headed. A billion dollar valuation. Unless you take bad advice in which case you may as well have come up with a chain of very successful yogurt shops. When you go fishing you can catch a lot of fish or you can catch a big fish. You ever walk into a guy’s den and see a picture of him standing next to fourteen trout?
CHRISTY
No, he’s holding a 3000 pound marlin.
SEAN
Yep.
MARK
That’s a good analogy.
EDUARDO
Okay, but we all know that marlins don’t really weigh 3000 pounds, right?
CHRISTY
Have you seen the big ones up close?
EDUARDO
I haven’t but I don’t think the guy’s holding a marlin the size of a Range Rover. That would be a really big fish and a very strong guy.
CHRISTY
You think we might be getting away from the point?

He picked up the check, he told Mark they’d talk again soon and he was gone. But not before he made his biggest contribution to the company.

Drop the “the”. Just Facebook. It’s cleaner.

That’s gotta be some kind of land speed record for talking.

What’d you think?

Sure, let’s drop the “the”.

Why Florida?

We stipulate.

And that was April 13th, 2004.

You can mark it.

Do you have anything here?
SY
Yes, thank you. Mr. Saverin, have you ever done anything that might be considered legitimate grounds for termination?

No.

I have my final coming up for “Postwar and Contemporary Art” and I haven’t been to class. I’m supposed to write about those four paintings.

INT. COMPUTER SCIENCE BUILDING/BASEMENT CORRIDOR - NIGHT
EDUARDO steps through double doors and stops for a moment as he HEARS an odd sound--RAUCOUS CHEERING from a CROWD that’s gathered in one of the classrooms.
EDUARDO walks down to the classroom, opens the door and walks into--
INT. CLASSROOM - NIGHT
--where 60 or so STUDENTS are in a semi-circle, five and six deep, cheering on the contestants for the internship.
All the desks in the room have been moved to the sides and five desks with laptops set up in the middle. Next to each laptop is a shot glass filled with Jack Daniels.
DUSTIN’s holding a watch and MARK is walking slowly back and forth behind the five “interviewees” who are intensely typing at their keyboards.
EDUARDO slowly makes his way through the crowd to MARK. He can see that on the computer screens are a whole lot of numbers and letters that neither he nor we can understand.
114.
He stands next to MARK and watches this for a moment. Every once in a while, one of the contestants will throw back their shot of Jack Daniels which will instantly get re-filled by a PRETTY ASIAN GIRL. Throughout all this the CHEERING CONTINUES.
DUSTIN
(waving EDUARDO over)
Eduardo!
EDUARDO
(pause)
Yo. Mark?
MARK
Yeah.
EDUARDO
What’s goin’ on?
MARK
They have 10 minutes to get root access to a Python webserver, expose its SSL encryption and then intercept all traffic over its secure port.
EDUARDO
They’re hacking.
MARK
Yes, all behind a Pix Firewall Emulator.
But here’s the beauty.
EDUARDO
You know I didn’t understand anything you just said, right?
MARK
I do know that.
EDUARDO
What’s the beauty?
MARK
Every 10th line of code written, they have to drink a shot. And hacking’s supposed to be stealth, so anytime the server detects an intrusion, the candidate responsible has to drink a shot. I also have a program running that has a pop-up window appear simultaneously on all five computers--the last candidate to hit the window has to drink a shot. Plus every three minutes they all have to drink a shot.
DUSTIN
(calling out)
Three minutes.
115.
All five candidates drain their shot glasses and slam them down where they get re-filled by the pretty Asian girl.
EDUARDO
Can I ask--what part of the interns’ jobs will they need to be able to do drunk?
MARK
You’re right. A more relevant test might be seeing if they can keep a chicken alive for a week.
(pause)
That was mean.
EDUARDO hands MARK a thick envelope--
EDUARDO
Here.
MARK
What’s this?
EDUARDO
I opened a new account and put $18,000 in it. Will that get you through the summer?
MARK looks at EDUARDO... 
Suddenly two of the candidates hands shoot up almost at the same time--
INTERN [ERIC]
Here!
INTERN [IAN]
Right here!
MARK glances over at the first screen, then the second...

Welcome to Facebook.
The place ERUPTS. The pretty ASIAN GIRL hits an mp3 player that’s been hooked up to speakers and a Dr. Dre song blares out--”California, it’s time to party... ”

After expressing misgivings about Mr. Zuckerberg taking the company and moving it to California for the summer, why did you put $18,000 in an account for his use?
EDUARDO
I figured we were partners and I wanted to be a team player. I figured Mark, Dustin and the new interns could work on the site while I was generating advertiser interest in New York. But mostly I figured... how much could go wrong in three months?

EXT. PALO ALTO HOUSE - DAY
We’re outside of this small, campus-area house as LOUD MUSIC plays. A zip line is tied from the chimney and runs down over a small swimming pool where it’s attached to a telephone pole on the other side.
MARK is standing in the pool and video taping as DUSTIN, who’s on the roof, grabs the handle, takes off and jumps into the pool to everyone’s cheers.
We HEAR the GUYS joke about the quality of the jump.
The handle gets pulled back on a rope, an INTERN grabs it, jumps--
--and the brick chimney comes crashing down.
The INTERN drops into patio furniture as bricks from the chimney come cascading down.
No one moves--
INTERN [ERIC]
I’m okay.
MARK
You sure?
ERIC
Yeah.
DUSTIN
Yikes.
And at that moment a stray brick drops from the roof and crashes through a glass patio table.

MARK walks into--
INT. PALO ALTO HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
The place is computer geek paradise. Computers are everywhere, along with some of the empty boxes they came in. Pizza boxes, Chinese food containers, empty beer bottles and white boards filled with indecipherable code fill the room. There are a couple of large mattresses on the floor and a large map of the U.S. with pins and tags showing the schools where they’ve already put Facebook and different pins showing the schools they’re going for.
As MARK walks to the door, he walks past ANDREW, who’s sitting at a computer, writing code and completely oblivious to everything around him.
MARK
(snapping his fingers)
Andrew.
ANDREW
Not now.
MARK
Good boy.
MARK gets to the door and opens it.
He’s stunned to see SEAN PARKER standing there with his girlfriend, SHARON.

A beer comes flying out of the kitchen and SEAN catches it. MARK (OS) (CONT’D)

An ultra-hip San Francisco nightclub. It’s a hundred-year old theater that’s been converted into a 21st Century hot spot for Silicon Valley’s rock stars. The lower level is a giant dance floor packed with sweating 20-somethings bouncing to pounding house music. There are raised blocks where scantily dressed professional dancers perform non-stop. A huge lighting grid hangs from the ceiling shooting colored lights and lasers everywhere. Also hanging from the ceiling are two trapeze bars with two performers swinging and contorting.
The staircase leads up to the 2nd level which is all VIP tables that look out over the dance floor. Each VIP area has a couple of couches and a table covered in bottles of vodka, tequila, rum, mixers, ice, glasses and a private waitress who’s happy to bend over and pour a drink for you.
And that’s where we catch up with MARK and SEAN. Sitting next to SEAN is a BEAUTIFUL WOMAN and there’s another standing behind him and leaning against the couch.
MARK and SEAN have to speak up above the music.

EXT. THE THAMES - DAY
We’re looking at a stone bridge crossing a perfectly straight stretch of water against the backdrop of the medieval town of Henley, England--founded in 1179.
And after a moment of placid quiet-- --BOOSH!
Two razor thin skulls explode for the final, agonizing hundred-meter stretch of the ancient and prestigious Henley Royal Regatta.
The two boats are neck and neck. The port-side boat is being crewed by the two Dutch members of the Hollandia Roeiclub. The starboard boat is being crewed by a pair of identical twins wearing tank tops bearing the “H” of Harvard.
We HEAR the ROAR come up from the CROWD in the viewing section. The crowd is dressed as if for opening day at Ascot-- the women in flowing dresses and wide-brimmed hats, the men in blazers and brightly colored floral ties.
But the young men in the boats can barely hear the crowd. Just their own breathing as they pull against the longest natural straight stretch of water in the world--a mile and a half torture test against the best competition they’ve ever faced.
And they’re neck and neck. CAMERON and TYLER can’t shake the Dutch.
125.
The CROWD is going crazy. Mixed in with the British crowd is a small contingent waving the flag of Holland and a slightly larger contingent of Americans.
We’ll notice a stoic man in a VIP viewing section and later we’ll be introduced to him as Cameron and Tyler’s father. Next to him is their mother, who can barely watch.
Back on the boats it’s just the breathing as the skulls slice through the water like jet-powered knives. 50 meters now and there’s still no daylight between them.
25 meters and the Dutch and American fans are going crazy-- even the British aristocracy can’t help but get caught up in the closest race in the history of the competition. The FATHER is silently willing his boys one more fraction of boat speed-- the MOTHER has her hands over her mouth in praying position.
POP!
--the finish gun is fired into the air, the oars come out of the water and the bodies of the crewmen slump over.
CAMERON turns his head to the cheering crowd to see the Dutch group holding a giant flag and jumping up and down. The Americans bring their giant flag down and fold it up.
The two DUTCH CREW MEMBERS pump their fists in the air and hug as the two boats skim along to a gentle stop.
The MOTHER drops her head and looks down. The FATHER refuses to look away.
From CAMERON and TYLER, just the breathing.

Stop it. Stop it, Cameron. Knock it off. I don’t mind that we lost to the Dutch today by less than a second. That was a good race, that was a fair race and they’ll see us again. What I mind--and what you should mind--is showing up on Monday for a race that was run on Sunday.
(beat)
We tried talking to him ourselves, we tried writing a letter, we tried the Ad Board, and we tried the president of the University. Now I’m asking you. For the last time! Let’s take the considerable resources at our disposal and sue him in federal court!
CAMERON looks at his brother and DIVYA... 
DIVYA
Come on.
CAMERON
(pause)
I need a real drink.
CAMERON takes a few steps away as TYLER and DIVYA drop their heads in surrender but then CAMERON turns right back--
CAMERON (CONT’D)
Screw it. Let’s gut the freakin’ nerd.
DIVYA grabs CAMERON and hugs him.
TYLER
That’s what I’m talking about.
INT. PALO ALTO HOUSE - NIGHT
There’s a thunderstorm going on outside and rain is beating hard against the windows. DUSTIN, ANDREW and the INTERNS are hard at work writing code. Green Day is pumping from the speakers.
SEAN is pacing the house on a cordless phone while two YOUNG WOMEN--dressed to go out for a party--are at the moment each on a free computer playing each other in a game of Counter-Strike. Basically they’re shooting at each other and missing and laughing their heads off.
130.
It wouldn’t appear as if the house has been cleaned since the last time we saw it and in fact there are signs of more wreckage as well as futons, pillows and blankets on the floor.
There’s also a 12-foot bong that reaches the middle landing of the staircase.
SEAN
(into phone)
Check it out, I saw him today.
(beat)
Manningham, Mitchell Manningham, my Case Equity guy--hang on.
(to the girls)
Are you guys using spikes or ghost missiles?
GIRL #1
We don’t know, we’re just shooting at each other.
The DOORBELL RINGS but no one pays attention--
SEAN
Use sweet kamakazis.
GIRL #1
Like we know what that is.
Now there’s a KNOCKING at the door and we
CUT TO:
EXT. PALO ALTO HOUSE - NIGHT
Rain is soaking down on EDUARDO as he stands at the front door with a suitcase in his hand. A taxi is turning around in the driveway and heading off. EDUARDO knocks on the front door again as we

INT. PALO ALTO HOUSE - NIGHT
SEAN
(into phone)
I saw him getting into his turbo Carerra and he saw me too, I know he did.
(beat)
Don’t sweat it, I’m on a land line.
SEAN leans over one of the girls, casually hits a few keys and easily kills several of the other girl’s soldiers.
GIRL #1
Yes!
131.
GIRL #2
Hey!
GIRL #1
Bong hit!
She has to take one as a penalty.
DUSTIN
Does, anybody hear that banging?
SEAN
(to DUSTIN)
You don’t hear anything, you’re writing code.
DUSTIN
Dude, somebody’s at the door.
SEAN goes back to the phone conversation as he heads to the door--
SEAN
(into phone)
It’s not a dish best served cold. It’s best served immediately and relentlessly.
SEAN opens the door and the soaking wet EDUARDO is standing there... 
SEAN (CONT’D)
(into phone)
I’m gonna call you back.
(to EDUARDO)
What’s up?
EDUARDO
(long pause)
What’s up?
(beat)
Mark was supposed to pick me up at the airport an hour ago, I’ve been calling his cell.
SEAN
He was on a 36 hour coding tear so he took a nap for a couple of hours.
EDUARDO walks into the house and surveys the wreckage--
EDUARDO
What happened here?
SEAN
Not happened--happening. The next big thing.
132.
DUSTIN
Wardo!
EDUARDO
Hey man.
SEAN
(to DUSTIN)
Back to work.
GIRL #2
The more bad I get at this, the more wasted I get. I meant the more--
SEAN
We understand.
EDUARDO
How old are they, Sean?
SEAN
It’s not polite to ask.
EDUARDO
Sean, how old are they?
SEAN
You think you know me. Right?
EDUARDO
I’ve read enough.
SEAN
You know how much I’ve read about you?
Nothing.
MARK comes down the stairs--
MARK
Wardo.
EDUARDO
I waited an hour for you at the airport.
MARK
What time is it?
EDUARDO
It’s midnight. Or 3AM in New York where I just came from.
MARK
You’ve gotta see some of the new stuff we’ve got. Dustin, show him the wall. I’m just calling it the wall.
133.
SEAN
Forget the wall, tell him about the meeting I’ve got set up.
(to EDUARDO)
You know Peter Thiel?
EDUARDO
No.
SEAN
No reason you should. He just runs a two-billion dollar hedge fund called Clarium Capital.
EDUARDO
(to MARK)
Why’s he setting up meetings?
MARK
Thiel may want to make an angel
investment.
EDUARDO
I don’t care if he’s an actual angel, why’s he setting up business meetings?
MARK
You’ve had a long flight.
EDUARDO
No, I’ve had a long wait on the tarmac at JFK, then a long wait at the passenger loading and unloading zone at SFO and in between there was a long flight. I’m the business end of this company and he’s a house guest living here rent-free on a generous grant from the Eduardo Saverin Foundation.
SEAN
I heard about your big ticket ad buys lined up.
EDUARDO
Hey, man--
SEAN
Gary’s Tuxedos, the Harvard Bartending Course. You’re just one small step away from bagging Snookies Cookies, I can feel it.
EDUARDO
(to MARK)
Want to talk to me alone for a minute?
MARK
Sure.
134.
SEAN
(calling out)
Bong hit!
GIRL #2
I’m so high.
SEAN
You’re not.
EDUARDO’s followed MARK into--
INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
MARK
How’s it going? How’s the internship?
How’s Christy?
EDUARDO
How’s the internship?
MARK
Yeah.
EDUARDO
Mark... Jesus, I quit the internship. We’ve talked about this on the phone, were you even--I quit on my first day.
MARK
I do remember you saying that. How’s
Christy?
EDUARDO
Christy’s crazy.
MARK
Is that fun?
EDUARDO
No I mean she’s actually psychotic. She’s insanely jealous, she’s irrational and I’m frightened of her.
MARK
Still, it’s nice you have a girlfriend.
EDUARDO
I do not want that guy representing himself as part of this company.
MARK
You gotta move out here, Wardo, this is where it’s all happening.
EDUARDO
Did you hear what I just said?
135.
MARK
The connections, the energy--
EDUARDO
Mark--
MARK
I’m afraid if you don’t come out here you’re going to get left behind. I want-- I want--I need you out here, please don’t tell him I said that.
EDUARDO
What did you just say?
MARK
It’s moving faster than any of us ever even imagined and--
EDUARDO
What do you mean get left behind?
MARK
It’s moving fast and Sean even thinks that--
EDUARDO
Sean is not part of the company.
MARK
We have over 300,000 members, Wardo, we’re in 160 schools including--
EDUARDO
I’m aware of that.
MARK
--five in Europe.
EDUARDO
I’m aware of that, Mark, I’m the CFO.
MARK
We need more servers than I ever imagined we’d need. We need more programmers. And we need more money. And he set up the Thiel meeting. He’s set up meetings all around town.
EDUARDO
He’s set up other meetings?
MARK
Yes.
EDUARDO
Without me knowing anything about it?!
136.
MARK
You’re in New York!
EDUARDO
I’m in New York riding subways 14 hours a day trying to find advertisers!
MARK
And how’s it going so far?!!
EDUARDO
What did you mean get left behind?
EDUARDO looks at MARK for a long moment before we

EDUARDO
I’d like to freeze this bank account and cancel all existing checks and lines of credit.
BANKER

EDUARDO
Yeah, sure.
CUT TO:
EXT./EST. SAN FRANCISCO SKYSCRAPER - DAY 80 stories of polished granite. INT. THIEL’S OUTER OFFICE - DAY
We’re in the offices of a guy who’s hero is Gordon Gekko. MARK and SEAN are waiting--seated side by side--for a verdict. SEAN’s wearing his best Prada, MARK’s wearing his hoodie and Adidas flip-flops.
After a moment an ASSISTANT comes out... 
ASSISTANT
Sean, he’ll be right with you.
137.
SEAN
No problem.
(to MARK)
You know this is where they filmed Towering Inferno.
MARK
(pause)
That’s comforting.
The office door opens and PETER THIEL sticks his head out--
PETER
Hey, guys. Come on back.
They get up and walk into--
INT. THIEL’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Several of Thiel’s lieutenant’s are sitting around.
PETER
She offer you guys some waters?
SEAN
Oh yeah, we’re cool.
MAURICE
Sean, come on in. You must be Mark.
MARK
Hi.
PETER
We took a look at everything and congratulations. We’re gonna start you off with a $500,000 investment. Maurice is gonna talk to you about some corporate restructuring.
MAURICE
We’ll file as a Corporation in Delaware and come up with a stock structure that allows for new investors.
PETER
Now lemme ask you something. Who’s
Eduardo Saverin?
CUT TO:
INT. EDUARDO’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
A summer sub-let. A studio apartment the size of a small tool shed.
138.
EDUARDO is asleep on top of the covers in the un-air conditioned apartment when he wakes up to the sound of a key in the door.
One lock un-locks, then another--
--and then the last.
The door opens and CHRISTY is framed by the dingy light of the hallway.
EDUARDO
Jesus Christ.
CHRISTY
When did you get back?
EDUARDO
You scared me. I need you to knock.
CHRISTY
When did you get back?
EDUARDO
I got back this afternoon.
CHRISTY
And when were you going to call me?
EDUARDO
Chris, it was kind of a rough trip and I was tired and--
CHRISTY
Or answer one of my 47 texts? Did you know I sent 47 texts?
EDUARDO
I did, and I thought that was incredibly normal behavior.
CHRISTY
Are you mocking me?
EDUARDO
I brought you a present.
CHRISTY
Why does your status say “single” on your
Facebook page?
EDUARDO
(beat)
What?
139.
CHRISTY
Why does your relationship status say “single” on your Facebook page?
EDUARDO
I was single when I set up the page.
CHRISTY
And you just never bothered to change it?
EDUARDO
(beat)
I--
CHRISTY
What?!
EDUARDO
I don’t know how.
CHRISTY
Do I look stupid to you?
EDUARDO
No. Calm down.
CHRISTY
You’re asking me to believe that the CFO of Facebook doesn’t know how to change his relationship status on Facebook?
EDUARDO
It’s a little embarrassing so you should take it as a sign of trust that I would tell you that.
CHRISTY
Go to hell.
EDUARDO
(calming)
Take it easy.
CHRISTY
No, you didn’t change it so you could screw Silicon Valley sluts every time you go out to see Mark.
EDUARDO
That is not even remotely true and I can promise you that the Silicon Valley sluts don’t care what anyone’s relationship status is on Facebook. Please, open your present.
EDUARDO’s cell phone RINGS--
140.
CHRISTY
Oh, your phone does work.
EDUARDO reaches for his cell but CHRISTY grabs it first to check the ID.
CHRISTY (CONT’D)
It’s Mark.
CHRISTY tosses the still ringing phone back to him--
EDUARDO
Okay, this is gonna be tricky. Here, open your present. It’s a silk scarf.
CHRISTY
Have you ever seen me wear a scarf?
EDUARDO
This’ll be your first.
EDUARDO’s gotten the gift box out of his half un-packed suitcase, tossed it to CHRISTY and finally answered the phone.
EDUARDO (CONT’D)

Yeah.

INT. PALO ALTO HOUSE - SAME TIME
MARK
(into his cell phone)
You froze our account?
In the background there’s a small celebration going on with SEAN, DUSTIN, the INTERNS and of course some GIRLS. Champagne is being sprayed from shaken bottles and the girls are dancing to triumphant music.
EDUARDO
I did.
MARK
You froze the account.
EDUARDO
I had to get your attention, Mark.
MARK
Do you realize that you jeopardized the entire company? Do you realize that your actions could have permanently destroyed everything I’ve been working on?
141.
EDUARDO
We’ve been working on.
MARK
Without money, the site can’t function.
Let me tell you the difference between
Facebook and everybody else: WE DON’T
CRASH EVER!
What EDUARDO can’t see behind his back is that CHRISTY has taken the gift box and lit it on fire with a cigarette lighter.
MARK (CONT’D)
If the servers are down for even a day, our entire reputation is irreversibly destroyed. Users are fickle. Friendster has proven that fact.
And CHRISTY’s now dropped the flaming cardboard box into the wastebasket where the fire grows larger. She casually kicks the basket over with her foot.
EDUARDO
Look--
MARK
Even a few people leaving would reverberate through the entire user base. The users are interconnected, that’s the whole point! College kids are online because their friends are online and if one domino goes, all the dominos go! Do you get that?! I’m not going back to Caribbean Night at A-E-Pi!
EDUARDO
(finally seeing the fire)
Holy shit!
(to CHRISTY)
What is wrong with you?
MARK
Did you like being nobody?! Did you like being a joke?! Do you wanna go back to that?!
EDUARDO
Hang on, hang on.
EDUARDO hits a button on his cell and tosses it down. We’ll keep hearing MARK’s voice as EDUARDO runs out into the hallway, grabs a fire extinguisher from its wall bracket, comes back in and sprays out the fire.
MARK
That was the act of a child, not a businessman.
(MORE)
142.
MARK (CONT'D)
And it certainly wasn’t the act of a friend. You know how embarrassed I was for me to try and cash a check today? I’m not going back to that life.
(beat)
Maybe you were frustrated.
EDUARDO
(shouting)
Yeah!
MARK
Maybe you were angry.
EDUARDO
(calling out)
I was!
MARK
But I’m willing to let bygones be bygones because, Wardo, I’ve got some good news.
EDUARDO--with the fire now out--picks up the phone.
EDUARDO
I’m sorry. I was angry and maybe it was childish. But I had to get your attention.
MARK
Wardo, I said I’ve got some good news.
EDUARDO
What is it?
MARK
Peter Thiel’s just made an angel investment of a half a million dollars.
EDUARDO
(pause)
What?
MARK
A half a million dollars and he’s setting us up in an office. They want to re-incorporate the company, they want to meet you they need your signature on some documents so get your ass on the next flight back to San Francisco.
(beat)
I need my CFO.
EDUARDO
(beat--smiles)
I’m on my way.
143.
MARK
Wardo.
EDUARDO
Yeah.
MARK
We did it.
EDUARDO clicks the phone shut. After a moment... 
CHRISTY
(like nothing’s happened)
Wardo?
And EDUARDO jumps because CHRISTY was standing behind him--
EDUARDO
Aaggh!
CHRISTY
You going back there already?
EDUARDO
Yes. Also I’m breaking up with you.
CUT TO:
INT. FACEBOOK OFFICE - DAY
A glass conference room in the corner of a glass bullpen on a high floor of a high rise.
Cartons are being unpacked, computers are everywhere along with bags of potato chips and boxes of cereal.
In the conference room, EDUARDO is sitting with three LAWYERS at a round, glass table and documents have been put out in front of him.
We can see through the glass that MARK is working at a computer nearby. SEAN is also hovering in the background.
LAWYER
Four documents. The first two are common stock purchase agreements allowing you to buy stock in the newly re-incorporated Facebook as opposed to the old shares which are now worthless. The third is the exchange agreement, allowing you to exchange the old shares for new shares and then finally a voter holding agreement.
EDUARDO
How many shares of stock will I own?
144.
LAWYER
1,328,334.
EDUARDO
Jesus Christ.
LAWYER
That represents a 34.4% ownership share.
Why the increase from the original 30%?
EDUARDO
Because you may need to dilute it to award shares to new investors.
LAWYER
I like working with business majors.
EDUARDO
Economics.
LAWYER #2
You should know that Mark’s already taken his percentage from 60 down to 51.
EDUARDO
Mark doesn’t care about money and he needs to be protected.
LAWYER
Dustin Moskovitz owns 6.81%, Sean Parker 6.47%--
EDUARDO
I can live with that.
LAWYER
And Peter Theil 7%. Would you like to use my pen?

No. It was an outrageously leading question the first time around and now you want us to hear it again?
GRETCHEN
Yes, would you read it back, please.
SY
Well, go ahead.
COURT REPORTER
Counsel: “And when you signed these documents, were you aware that you were signing your own death certificate?”
EDUARDO

No.

I was your only friend. You had one friend.

My father won’t even look at me.
GRETCHEN

Okay. Eduardo? Did Mr. Zuckerberg say anything to you after you signed the papers?
EDUARDO
There was a lot of handshaking and a lot of congratulations. He’d already told me that he wouldn’t be coming back to school for at least a semester so we were saying goodbye for a while. And then before I left, he said--
CUT TO:
INT. FACEBOOK OFFICE - DAY
MARK
But you gotta come back. Somewhere around the end of November/early December. Peter wants to throw us an amazing party when we hit a million members, it’s gonna be out of control. You’ve gotta come back for it.

A brand new black Escalade pulls up in front of a gleaming glass and chrome office building. SEAN is at the wheel and MARK, in the passenger seat, is wearing brightly colored pajamas with his hair a mess.
They get out of the car and huddle on the sidewalk.
MARK
You sure about this?
SEAN
You’re 20 minutes late. You’re going to walk in there and say you overslept and you didn’t have time to get dressed.
They’re gonna pitch you. Case Equity is gonna pitch you. They’re gonna beg you to take their money. You’re gonna nod, you’re gonna nod, you’re gonna nod and then you’re gonna say, “Which one of you is Roth--” No, not Roth, Manningham. “Which one of you is Mitchell Manningham?”. And he’ll say, “I am”. And you say, “Sean Parker says ‘Fuck you’ and on walk out.
MARK

Okay.
CUT TO:

INT. FIRST DEPOSITION ROOM - EVENING
EDUARDO
In late November I got the e-mail from Mark telling me to come out for the millionth member party.
GRETCHEN
What else did the e-mail say?
EDUARDO
It said that we had to have a business meeting. That Mark and Sean had played some kind of revenge stunt on Case Equity and that Manningham was so impressed that he was making an investment offer that was hard to turn down.
CUT TO:
INT. NEW FACEBOOK OFFICES - NIGHT
EDUARDO (V.O.)
I went out to California and I went straight to the new offices.
And it’s clear that we’re in the offices of a new, high-tech, very successful internet company. The Facebook logo in blue metallic letters on the wall, the maple desks, new computer monitors, carpeting, a wall covered in graffiti by an artist commissioned for the job and tons of young employees.
EDUARDO (V.O.)
I didn’t know whether to dress for the party or for the business meeting so I kind of dressed for both.
We see that most of the employees, especially the women, are dressed to go to an after-work, late-night party.
EDUARDO (V.O.)
But it didn’t matter.
GRETCHEN (V.O.)
Why not?
EDUARDO (V.O.)
Because I wasn’t called out there for either one.

EDUARDO turns to see the LAWYER he dealt with earlier standing by the door to a glass conference room.
LAWYER (CONT’D)
In here. Right over here.
EDUARDO walks across the bullpen, where no one makes eye contact, and into--
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS
EDUARDO (V.O.)
At first I thought he was joking, giving me more contracts to sign. But then I started reading.
As EDUARDO reads, we rack focus to MARK, who’s sitting at a computer with his back to EDUARDO, focused on his work.
And then we see SEAN step into the frame and lean against a desk a few yards away.
And then back to EDUARDO, who’s almost shaking... 
EDUARDO
Wait, what is this?
LAWYER
Well, as you know we had some new
investors--

I’m sorry?
SEAN
He’s wired in.

SEAN
Yes.
EDUARDO picks up MARK’s laptop over his head and smashes it down on the desk, breaking it into pieces.
EDUARDO
How ‘bout now, are you still wired in?
SEAN
(to the girl at the desk he’s
leaning against)
Call security.
Everyone in the office is frozen, silent and watching.
EDUARDO
You issued over 24-million new shares of stock.

You were told that if new investors came along--
EDUARDO
How much were your shares diluted? How much were his?!

MARK
You signed the papers.
EDUARDO
You set me up.
MARK
You’re gonna blame me because you were the business head of the company and you made a bad business deal with your own company?!
EDUARDO
It’s gonna be like I’m not part of
Facebook.
SEAN
It’s won’t be like you’re not part of
Facebook, you’re not part of Facebook.
EDUARDO
My name’s on the masthead.

SEAN
You might wanna check again.
EDUARDO is momentarily frozen... 
EDUARDO
This is because I froze the account?
SEAN
You think we were gonna let you parade around in your ridiculous suits pretending you were running this company?
EDUARDO
Sorry, my Prada’s at the cleaners along with my hoodie and my fuck-you flip-flops you pretentious douchebag.

I’m not signing those papers.
SEAN
We’ll get the signature.
EDUARDO

Tell me this isn’t about me getting into the Phoenix!
(pause)
EDUARDO (CONT’D)
You did it. I always knew you did it. You planted the story about the chicken.
SEAN
(pause)
What is he talking about?
EDUARDO
You had me accused--
SEAN
Seriously, what the hell’s the chicken?
EDUARDO
And I’ll bet what you hated the most is that they identified me as a co-founder of Facebook--which I am! You better lawyer-up, asshole, ‘cause I’m not comin’ back for my 30 percent, I’m comin’ back for everything!
152.
SEAN
(to SECURITY)
Get him outa here.
EDUARDO
I’m going.
SEAN
Hang on.
SEAN hands EDUARDO a folded check.
SEAN (CONT’D)
I almost forgot, there’s your $19,000. I wouldn’t cash it, though, I drew it on the account you froze.
EDUARDO looks at SEAN... then suddenly and quickly cocks his fist back to punch him in the face. SEAN flinches as EDUARDO holds his punch and lets out a small laugh.
EDUARDO
I like standing next to you, Sean. It makes me look so tough.
EDUARDO exits with the security escort.
There’s a long silence in the room... 
SEAN
That’s it, that’s our show for tonight, people. So I want to see everybody here geared up for a party. We’re gonna walk down to the club like it’s the Macy’s Parade. Mackey, put it up on the big screen, we’ve gotta be almost there.
A young employee hits a remote and a few keys on his computer and a huge flat-screen displays a Facebook page with a read-out of the number of members.
999,942
There’s scattered applause and excitement as everyone watches.
SEAN takes MARK aside.
SEAN (CONT’D)
You alright?
MARK
Yeah.
(beat)
You were kinda rough on him.
SEAN
That’s life in the NFL.
153.
MARK
You know you didn’t have to be that rough on him.
SEAN
Listen, I’m putting together a party--
MARK
Sean? You didn’t have to be that rough on him.
SEAN
He almost killed it. I’ll send flowers. Speaking of flowers, I’m putting together a party after the party at Kappa Eta Sigma. Ashleigh’s a sister.
MARK
Uh... Ashleigh?
SEAN
The intern.
MARK
No, yeah, I know who she is. Are you guys--
SEAN
Ashleigh? Me? No. A little bit. Oh no, do you like her? Dude--
MARK
No. No. I was just, no.
An intern, ASHLEIGH, comes along with a small package--
ASHLEIGH
Excuse me, Mark?
SEAN
We were just talkin’ about you.
MARK
Just that you’re doing a really good job.
ASHLEIGH
Thanks, I appreciate that.
(to MARK)
These came in for you.
MARK
Put them on my desk.
ASHLEIGH puts the small package on Mark’s desk.
SEAN
What’s the package?

MARK
Nothing.
SEAN

MACKEY

Yes sir!

We hear the thumping music from the party. SEAN’s in there with a couple of guys, ASHLEIGH and two other girls. SEAN’s got his cell phone out and will snap a picture every once in a while.
FRATERNITY GUY
Do it on anything. You can use a CD.
SORORITY GIRL #2
You can do it off me.
The girl’s sat on the bed and unbuttoned her top. Her shirt’s unbuttoned all the way but we can’t really see anything--just the part of her chest that’s being used as a surface off of which to snort coke.
SORORITY GIRL
Alright!
155.
The GIRL taps out some coke from a vial onto the other girl’s chest and starts passing around a rolled up 20-dollar bill for everyone to have a turn and she herself will unbutton her shirt too for the same purpose. All this while SEAN is talking.
SEAN
The next transformative development? A picture sharing application. A place where you view pictures that coincide with your social life. It is... the true digitalization of real life. You don’t just go to a party anymore, you go to a party with your digital camera and your friends relive the party on Facebook. And tagging. The idea--
SORORITY GIRL #2
Would this be easier without the bra?
FRATERNITY GUY
It’s worth finding out.
The girls start happily slipping off their bras--
SEAN
I’ve spent hours watching what people do when they log on.
ASHLEIGH
Wait, that’s weird. Why did the music stop?
ASHLEIGH has a point. The music stopped in the middle of SEAN’s speech and the sound outside from the party just doesn’t sound like a party anymore.
SEAN
How they check their friends’ status updates, checked to see which of their friends had changed their profiles, changed their photos and mostly... 
ASHLEIGH
Seriously, what happened to the music?
SEAN
We lived on farms and then we lived in cities and now we’re gonna live on the internet.
ASHLEIGH
Sean. Stop. I think something’s going on downstairs.
SEAN stops talking... he senses it too now.
SEAN walks out of the room to the--
156.
INT. STAIRCASE LANDING - CONTINUOUS
And out the window he sees a fleet of police cars with their lights flashing parked in front of the house. Then before he can react, the front door flies open--
POLICE with flashlights walk in--the beams of light streaking across the darkened party floor and the faces.
We HEAR muffled murmurs from the cops of “party’s over” and “step to the side” and “nobody’s leaving just yet”, etc.
SEAN bolts back into--
INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
--leaving the door open.
SEAN
It’s the cops.
And they all spring into action. The girls are putting their bras back on, SEAN is wiping down a night table with the palm of his hand to get the coke dust off.
SORORITY GIRL
Shit.
FRATERNITY GUY
Be cool.
They turn to see TWO POLICEMEN standing in the doorway, their flashlights scanning the room and hitting SEAN’s eyes.
SEAN
Good to see you officer. What can I do for you?
POLICEMAN
What’s goin’ on?
SEAN
(beat)
Was the music too loud? We have a
celebration going.
POLICEMAN
Miss, I need you to button your blouse.
SEAN
I can have them turn the music down.
One of the policemen casually takes SEAN’s hand and sees that his palm looks like he just used it to erase a blackboard.
SEAN (CONT’D)
That’s not mine.
157.
POLICEMAN
Okay, we’re gonna need identification.
Keep your hands where we can see them.
And the handcuffs start to come out and we’ve got a room of terrified children.
SORORITY GIRL
Oh my God.
We start to move in on SEAN... 
POLICEMAN
(to SEAN)
You got anything in your pockets I should know about?
SEAN
No sir, no.
POLICEMAN
Don’t be stupid now.
SEAN
I don’t.
POLICEMAN
(out of SEAN’s shirt pocket)
What’s this?
SEAN
It’s an Epipen.
POLICEMAN
And this?
SEAN
That’s my inhaler.
POLICEMAN #2
(to the GIRLS)
How old are you?
SORORITY GIRL
I’m 21.
ASHLEIGH
I’m 21.
POLICEMAN
Lying only makes it worse.
ASHLEIGH
I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have lied.
158.
SEAN closes his eyes at hearing this news as we HEAR the sound of the cuffs lock around his wrists and we
CUT TO:
INT. NEW FACEBOOK OFFICES - NIGHT
A digital LED clock on the wall tells us it’s 4:40AM.
MARK is sitting at his computer alone. No one else is in the office. The San Francisco skyline is beautiful outside the floor-to-ceiling glass.
His cell phone RINGS and he answers.
MARK
(into phone)
Hello?
INTERCUT WITH:
EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT
SEAN, freezing with no coat on, is sitting on the bottom of the steps to the police station.
SEAN
(into phone)
Listen, something’s happened.
We see MARK listening on his end but can’t hear SEAN’s end of the conversation.
MARK
(pause)
Shit.
SEAN
It’s alright, it’s gonna be alright. I’ve posted bond and I wasn’t doing anything. I mean, I’ve got allergies so I can’t--
We’re back on MARK’s side. He listens... listens... 
MARK
Interns?
Back on SEAN’s side--
SEAN
It was just a party.
MARK
(evenly)
This is gonna be news, Sean, it’s gonna be online any second.
159.
SEAN
(beat)
I know.
MARK
(blank)
You know with an intern and--
SEAN
It’s cool, I’ve got it under control.
MARK
(no panic)
I’ll get it under control. I’ll call someone and see what the next move is. But this is gonna be news now.
SEAN
(beat)
You don’t think Eduardo was involved do you? Do you think--
MARK
No.
SEAN
Or Manningham. One of them. Somebody. Somebody sent that coke in their ‘cause it got in there. You believe me. This is gonna be fine, right?
MARK
(cool as ice)
Go home, Sean.
MARK clicks the phone shut. He sits there a moment.
He looks at the small package that Ashleigh dropped on his desk earlier. He opens up the brown paper wrapping and there’s a box.
He opens the box--a thousand brand new business cards. He takes one of the business cards out and looks at it.
I’m CEO... Bitch
And over this we HEAR a woman’s voice... 
MARYLIN (V.O.)
Mark?
CUT TO:
160.
INT. FIRST DEPOSITION ROOM - NIGHT
MARK is sitting alone in the conference room. The only one left is MARYLIN, whose voice we just heard. The lights of the San Francisco skyline fill the huge picture windows.
MARYLIN
Mark?
MARK looks up at her... 
MARYLIN (CONT’D)
We’re done for the day.
MARK
(pause)
Yeah. Yeah. I was just sitting here.
MARYLIN
What happened to Sean?
MARK
He still owns 7% of the company. All you had all day was that salad. You want to get something to eat?
MARYLIN
I can’t.
MARK
I’m not a bad guy.
MARYLIN
I know that. When’s there’s emotional testimony I assume 85% of it is exaggeration.
MARK
And the other 15%?
MARYLIN
Perjury. Creation myths need a devil.
MARK
What happens now?
MARYLIN
Sy and the others are having a steak on University Ave. Then they’ll come back up to the office and start working on a settlement agreement to present to you.
MARK
They’re gonna settle?
161.
MARYLIN
Oh yeah. And you’re gonna have to pay a little extra.
MARK
Why?
MARYLIN
So that these guys sign a non-disclosure agreement. They say one unflattering word about you in public and you own their wife and kids.
MARK
I invented Facebook.
MARYLIN
I’m talking about a jury. I specialize in voir dire--jury selection. And what the jury sees when they look at the defendant. Clothes, hair, speaking style, likability--
MARK
Likability?
MARYLIN
I’ve been licensed to practice law for all of 20 months and I could get a jury to believe you planted the story about Eduardo and the chicken. Watch what else. Why weren’t you at Sean’s sorority party that night?
MARK
You think I’m the one who called the police?
MARYLIN
Doesn’t matter. I asked the question and now everybody’s thinking about it. You’ve lost your jury in the first 10 minutes.
MARK
(pause)
Farm animals?
MARYLIN
Yeah.
MARK
I was drunk and angry and stupid.
MARYLIN
And blogging.
MARK
And blogging.
162.
MARYLIN
(pause)
Pay them. In the scheme of things it’s a speeding ticket. That’s what Sy will tell you tomorrow.
MARK
Do you think anybody would mind if I stayed and used the computer for a minute?
MARYLIN
I can’t imagine it would be a problem.
MARK
Thanks. I appreciate your help today.
MARYLIN
You’re not an asshole, Mark. You’re just trying so hard to be.
MARYLIN, who’s been putting on her coat, takes her briefcase and exits.
MARK sits down at the computer. He logs on to Facebook.
He types a name in the search box: “Erica Albright”.
Erica’s name and picture come up, along with Boston University, ‘07. Mark smiles. She’s on Facebook.
He moves the mouse back and forth between two boxes: “Send a Message” and “Add as a Friend”.
He clicks on “Add as a Friend”.
A box comes up that reads: “Your request to add Erica Albright as a friend has been sent.”
Then MARK clicks to his homepage and waits for the response. And waits... then hits “Refresh”. TITLE:
Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss received a settlement of 65 million dollars and signed a non-disclosure agreement.
They rowed for the U.S. Olympic Team in Beijing and placed sixth.
MARK is still waiting... then hits “Refresh”.
Eduardo Saverin received an unknown settlement. His name has been restored to the Facebook masthead as a Co-founder.

MARK is settling into his chair. He’ll wait all night if he has to.
Facebook has 500 million members in 207 countries. It's currently valued at 25 billion dollars.
Mark Zuckerberg is the youngest billionaire in the world.
MARK waits... 
And waits...
