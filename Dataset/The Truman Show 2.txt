INT.	TRUMAN'S MOTHER'S APARTMENT, QUEENS.	DAY.
TRUMAN stands in the corridor of his mother's cramped, fussy. doilyed apartment with his older sister, RAQUEL, late forties, prematurely grey. Through a doorway, the figure of his MOTHER is visible asleep in bed, despite the early hour. Truman and Raquel speak in hushed tones to avoid waking her.
RAQUEL
Don't you dare go in. Truman. I just got her off to sleep.
TRUMAN
It was Dad. I swear.
Raquel fixes Truman with a contemptuous stare.
RAQUEL
Well, the next time he shows up. bring him over. Until then, I'm not saying a word about this to Mom and neither are you.
TRUMAN
If it wasn't him, it was his twin. Can you think of a reason he'd want to hide from us?
RACQUEL
I know a reason he'd want to hide from you. Look at how you treat us. You live ten minutes away, we hardly see you from year to year and then you turn up with this story so insane you don't even believe it yourself. Haven't you
hurt her enough, Truman?	She already blames you.
TRUMAN
(incredulous)
I was seven years old!
RAQUEL
But you're here and he's not. Has it really taken you this long to invent a story to ease your conscience?
TRUMAN
I'm telling you he's alive!
RAQUEL
(snapping back bitterly) And I'm telling you he's fish food!
Truman meets her unforgiving eyes. Without another word, he walks out of the apartment.
Truman safely departed, the figure in the bed, rolls out. CHRISTOF, fully clothed, relishing the danger of being so close to Truman without being detected. Raquel's demeanor immediately changes, all trace of bitterness gone from her face, she appears younger, posture more upright, almost a different person. Christof hugs Raquel.
CHRISTOF
You did well.
INT.	DRESSING ROOM SOMEWHERE.	NIGHT.
A cavernous dressing room contains a long row of identical mirrored make-up tables. At the only occupied table, Truman's contrite father, KIRK, is having what's left of his homeless disguise cleaned from his face by a MAKE-UP ARTIST under the watchful eye of two DARK-SUITED BODYGUARDS.
From a mezzanine floor out of Kirk's vision, CHRISTOF and CHLOE also take in the proceedings. Behind their heads, a monitor shows a surveillance picture of an agitated TRUMAN sitting in his car, trapped in rush-hour traffic.
CHLOE
We've tightened security.
Christof nods indifferently, knowing the damage is already done.
CHLOE
(referring to Kirk)
Why would he do this to us?
CHRISTOF
Old age. Sentiment. You play someone's father all those years, you are someone's father... He sees the way Truman is. He feels responsible.
Christof turns and enters an office adjacent to the balcony, containing a state-of-the-art monitor and VCR. Chloe follows. Christof plays the cued recording without comment. We focus on the screen.
EXT.	LONG ISLAND SOUND.	DAY, TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS EARLIER.
A younger-looking CHRISTOF sits in a motorboat in the calm
water of Long Island Sound. Truman's father, KIRK, twenty-seven years younger and a DARK HAIRED BOY, Truman's age at the time, acting as a stand-in, sit in the stern of a sailing dinghy. Two SCUBA DIVERS in the ocean.
YOUNG CHRISTOF
(barking instructions to Kirk)
... as soon as we give the cue, tack to windward... 
Kirk rehearses turning the tiller in the instructed direction.
YOUNG CHRISTOF
The freak wave will strike from the
starboard side.	Remember, you don't
go to the diver.	The diver goes to you.
To simulate the wave, one of the divers puts his full weight on the side of the dinghy to capsize it. Kirk and the boy are tossed into the water. While the boy immediately bobs to the surface in his life jacket, Kirk fails to surface. After a long moment, he reappears with the second diver some distance away. now wearing a spare aqualung.
YOUNG CHRISTOF
... Good! Good!... of course, on the day you only surface once you're safely beyond the cove... Try it one more time... You okay?
Kirk is staring at Truman's stand-in, clinging to the upturned boat. Kirk's expression suggests he is not a totally willing participant in the masquerade.
The present-day Christof freezes the monitor on Kirk's uncertain face.
INT.	TRUMAN'S GARAGE.	DUSK.
A cluttered garage, dimly lit by a single work lamp. TRUMAN looks over his shoulder before turning his attention to a dusty trunk under a canvas sheet. The trunk is fastened with a combination lock. He deftly dials the correct combination and opens the lid.
Inside, mementoes from his youth. A "HOW TO SAIL" book, a stack of "GREAT EXFLORERS" magazines, and beneath it all, a garment in a drycleaning bag. Truman carefully lifts up the plastic to reveal a schoolgirl's lavender cardigan decorated with pearl beading. He puts the cardigan to his nose and breathes deeply.
Footsteps. Truman hastily drops the cardigan in the trunk and shuts the lid. MERYL, standing close behind.
MERYL
What're you doing out here?
TRUMAN
(turning attention to an upturned mower on the garage floor)
Fixing the mower.
Meryl doesn't look like she buys it.
MERYL
(concerned)
Your sister called.	She was worried about you.
TRUMAN
(matter-of-fact)
I saw my father on State Street dressed as a homeless man.
MERYL
(attempting to comfort)
I kept seeing my brother for years after he died.
TRUMAN
(irritated at her subtle dismissiveness)
What do you want?
MERYL
I made macaroni.
TRUMAN
I gotta go out.	About a replacement... 
(hastily adding)
... mower blade.
Meryl nods, not at all convinced. After an uncomfortable pause, she turns and heads back to the house.
EXT.	CAR WASH.	DUSK.
TRUMAN ruefully examines the broken car aerial on his freshly washed Oldsmobile. In the background is the warning sign he has just ignored, "CLOSE WINDOWS, LOWER AERIALS".
Truman removes the metal coathanger from beneath the lavender cardigan and forces the bent wire into what's left of the severed aerial.
INT.	TRUMAN'S CAR.	DUSK.
TRUMAN motors down a busy shopping street, crowded on both sides with PEDESTRIANS. As he drives, he tests his car radio. Adjusting the tuner knob, he finds a station.
FEMALE VOICE (from radio) ... west on Atlantic... he's making a right on Woodhaven... 
Truman glances up at the street signs along his route and finds that they coincide exactly with the streets quoted on the radio. Distracted, he almost bowls over an OLD LADY on a crosswalk.
MALE VOICE (from radio)
... God, Truman almost hit Marilyn!... he's
on the move again, passing the Burger King... 
Truman readjusts the radio as it starts to fade out. Suddenly there is a piercing blast of feedback. He looks up and, as far as the eye can see, every PEDESTRIAN, MOTORIST and SHOPKEEPER along the street suddenly winces in pain and holds their right ear at exactly the same moment.
MALE VOICE
(from radio, in distress himself)
... something's wrong.	Change frequencies... 
Truman tries to pick up the channel once again but without success.
EXT.	DRUG STORE.	DUSK.
Still shaken by his experience with the radio, TRUMAN exits
a Drug Store with a small, brown paper bag. Out of the corner of his eye he catches a MALE BYSTANDER still checking his right ear with his finger. He goes to say something to the by-stander but thinks better of it.
EXT.	REDLIGHT DISTRICT, QUEENS.	NIGHT.
HOOKERS in white heels and spray-on skirts display their wares. TRUMAN cruises slowly past in his Oldsmobile, the expression of the prostitutes turning from seductive to contemptuous as each is by-passed.
Suddenly Truman pulls sharply into the curb beside a leggy, prostitute, VERONICA, wearing a platinum blonde wig. She is in deep discussion with a fellow WORKING GIRL. Veronica recognizes the car and instantly bends down to the open passenger window.
VERONICA
Hey, Truman! Where you bin? You bin cheatin' on me?
Veronica opens the door and folds herself into the passenger seat.
INT.	TRUMAN'S CAR.	NIGHT.
VERONICA knows the form. As TRUMAN pulls away from the curb, she is already removing the lavender cardigan from the drycleaning bag on the back seat. She drapes the cardigan around her shoulders.
VERONICA
Bout time you got this thing cleaned.
(half-joking)
Don't tell me you bin makin' your old lady wear it.
Truman passes her the brown paper bag without reply. Veronica removes a bottle of perfume and proceeds to liberally apply it.
VERONICA
(examining the bottle)
God, do they still make this stuff?
What's the Sell-By Date?
INT.	FLUSHING MEADOW PARK.	NIGHT.
From a vantage point in a disused tower high above the park. CHRISTOF and CHLOE watch as Truman's Oldsmobile enters the park grounds and comes to a stop near the large metal framed globe, the Unisphere. Both Christof and Chloe wear earpieces, a miniature television propped at their feet shows a close-up picture of TRUMAN and VERONICA inside the car.
CHLOE
(into a flip-phone,
condescending)
... you see him messing with the antenna... what did you think would happen?... "lapse of concentration", is that what you call it?
I	call it amateur-hour... 
(sarcastic)
In case you hadn't noticed, we don't get to do it over.
Christof, totally unfazed, regards his zealous young assistant with affection and even a mild amusement.
CHLOE
(as she hangs up, querying the smile that plays around his lips)
You think this is funny?
CHRISTOF
The mask has slipped before. Everything can be explained.
TRUMAN kills the lights and he and VERONICA exit the car unaware that they are being observed.
CHRISTOF
(adopting a more serious tone
as he returns his attention to Truman) What's dangerous is that he makes the connection between what happened today and the girl.
We focus on Truman and Veronica as they take a seat at the edge of the pool surrounding the great steel globe.
VERONICA
Like I say, I don't normally do this.
I gotta charge extra.
Truman nods his agreement and forks over several bills. Veronica deposits the money in her purse and perches herself as modestly as possible on the edge of the fountain.
When she is ready, Truman tenderly places his arm around her shoulder. Veronica responds, hesitantly, becoming immersed in her role. She reaches out her own hand and rests it on the nape of his neck. Slowly both heads drift together, but stop just short of their lips meeting, agonizingly close. So close they can feel each other's breath, barely a sliver of daylight separating them. Then finally their lips touch in the most gentle of caresses.
They hold the kiss for another long moment and then simultaneously break. As they look into each other's eyes, Truman goes to say something but Veronica hushes him by placing a finger to his lips. Then abruptly she moves out of frame, the cardigan falling from around her shoulders in her haste.
From Truman's POV we focus on the cardigan on the pavement, triggering a flashback in his head.
INT.	HIGH SCHOOL CORRIDOR.	DAY, SEVENTEEN YEARS EARLIER.
As with Truman's previous flashbacks, this scene appears to be playing on a television screen. However, on this occasion it is also accompanied by CHRISTOF's comments from his perch in the tower above the park.
CHRISTOF (V.O.)
He's re-created the event on and off for a number of years. We've never understood what prompts him to indulge the fantasy, or for that matter what inspired such a painfully shy boy to approach her in the first place... 
A	SEVENTEEN-YEAR-OLD TRUMAN, carrying a stack of books, spies LAUREN, sixteen going on thirty-five, wearing the lavender, beaded cardigan at her open locker. She is entertaining two GIRLFRIENDS with what appears to be a lewd tale.
CHRISTOF (V.O.)
We'd noticed them making eyes at each other for some weeks but never thought he'd say anything. She was a year older, wrote poetry, way out of his league... 
Truman, obviously terrified, musters the nerve to approach the lockers. The three girls look up, surprised by the interruption.
TRUMAN
(to Lauren, tongue-tied, a strangled greeting)
Hi.
GIRLFRIEND 1
(to Lauren as the two girlfriends abruptly depart)
See you in class.
Lauren is unsure whether or not to follow her friends.
TRUMAN
Lauren, right?
Her name is carefully written in blue ink on the covers of her text books.
LAUREN
No.
TRUMAN
(ignoring her lack of interest)
Look.	I was wonder--
LAUREN
--I can't go out with you.
TRUMAN
I haven't asked you yet.
LAUREN
Well when you do, that's my answer.
(softening)
I'm sorry.	It's not up to me.
TRUMAN
(summoning up courage from somewhere)
Why, you married?
Lauren smiles despite herself.
TRUMAN
I'm not asking you to have my children, just a pizza. How about Saturday?
LAUREN
(adamant)
No.
TRUMAN
Friday?
Lauren looks around the deserted school corridor.
LAUREN
Now.
TRUMAN
Right now?	We got finals.
LAUREN
If we don't go now, it won't happen.
Truman hesitates.
LAUREN
(impatient, looking anxiously around)
Well, what do you want to do?
THE PICTURE ON THE TELEVISION SCREEN SUDDENLY FAST-FORWARDS AT SUCH SPEED IT BECOMES A BLUR - THEN RETURNS TO NORMAL SPEED.
EXT.	FLUSHING MEADOW PARK.	DUSK.
The SEVENTEEN-YEAR-OLD TRUMAN and LAUREN enter the park near the Unisphere. The park is deserted on a hot June afternoon.
CHRISTOF (V.O.)
We knew we were taking a risk. She hadn't been properly coached, but we were torn... 
He'd summoned the courage to make the approach... We wanted to reward that. Of course she took full advantage... 
Truman and Lauren run up to the ledge of the pool surrounding the steel sculpture.
LAUREN
I never knew this place existed.
They both stare down at the inviting water. Lauren suddenly throws off her cardigan and jumps into the pool without another thought. She comes splashing to the surface. Truman stares down, transfixed hy the shimmering water.
LAUREN
Come on!	Come on!	It's wonderful!
TRUMAN
(nervous)
I... I can't.
Lauren suddenly stops splashing.
LAUREN
That's right.	Oh, God, I'm sorry.
She quickly climbs out of the pool, dripping wet.
TRUMAN
(confused)
Why? You've got nothing to be sorry about.
Has someone been talking to you?
Lauren wrings out her dress.
LAUREN
(to the sky, upset)
Get me out of here. I don't want to be here.
Lauren starts walking away.
TRUMAN
(confused, calling after her)
What are you talking about?	Lauren!	Lauren!
Truman runs after Lauren and holds her by the arms, forcing her to face him.
LAUREN
(distraught)
My name's not Lauren!	It's Sylvia!
Truman looks into her eyes and believes her.
THE PICTURE FAST-FORWARDS AGAIN AT HIGH SPEED FOR A MOMENT AND RETURNS TO NORMAL.
TRUMAN and SYLVIA (as she is now called throughout the remainder of the movie) sit on the ledge of the pool - the same spot as Truman and the hooker, Veronica, seventeen years later. As we have just seen imitated, Sylvia and Truman kiss with great delicacy. Truman goes to say something but she covers his lips with her finger.
SYLVIA
In a minute someone's going to come and stop me talking to you.
TRUMAN
(looking around the deserted park)
Who?	There's no one around.
SYLVIA
(covering his lips once again) You remember when you were a little boy, you stood up in class and said you wanted to be an explorer like Magellan. And your teacher, Sister Olivia said, "You're too late, Truman. There's nothing left to explore." And all the other kids laughed. And you sat down.
TRUMAN
(incredulous)
How do you know about that?
SYLVIA
It doesn't matter. You've forgotten about that boy, Truman. You got scared. Just because something happens, doesn't mean you can't take another chance in your life.
TRUMAN
I don't understand.
SYLVIA
(looking over her shoulder nervously) There isn't much time. Just listen. Everybody's pretending Truman. Everybody but you.
(pointing to the
buildings on the horizon)
Look at that project. You think anybody lives there? It's all for you, Truman. A show. The eyes are everywhere.
TRUMAN
(protesting)
Eyes?	Where?
SYLVIA
(frustrated, raving)
Everywhere, disguised... Truman, they're
going to fill your head with lies.
You've got to make yourself deaf, you
understand?	When you're afraid the most, it
means you're on the right track.	Trust that
boy.	Promise me you'll do that?
Truman nods, unsure of the commitment he is making.
Suddenly a 1962 Plymouth roars towards the fountain out of nowhere.
SYLVIA
(scared)
I told you, Truman!
The car skids to a stop and a large MAN, 40ish, with a shock of dark hair jumps from the car. The man yanks the frightened Sylvia to her feet causing her cardigan to fall to the ground.
TRUMAN
(shocked)
Hey!
MAN
(to Sylvia)
Get in the car, Lauren!
Truman jumps up.
TRUMAN
(to the Man)
Who are you?!
MAN
I'm her father!
SYLVIA
No he's not!	He's just saying that!
Does he look anything like me?!
TRUMAN
Shut your mouth!
The man backhands Sylvia roughly across the face and bundles her into his car. Truman rushes at the man.
TRUMAN
Leave her alone!
The man easily fends Truman off, knocking him to the ground.
He slams shut the passenger door of the Plymouth.
MAN
(to Sylvia)
I told you not to come here anymore! (to Truman, who is getting to his feet)
Which one are you?
Truman is suddenly struck dumb, the doubts start crowding back into his head.
SYLVIA
(calling out from the car)
Don't listen to him, Truman. Make yourself deaf. Come find me.
MAN
(to Truman, getting into the car) Don't bother! We're moving to Australia. New York's done something to her head.
The Plymouth roars away. Truman stares after it and then turns back to the cardigan left on the ground.
CHRISTOF (V.O.)
Why did he say Australia? Why couldn't he have said New Jersey?
EXT.	FLUSHING MEADOW.	DUSK, PRESENT DAY.
VERONICA'S head suddenly appears back in frame beside TRUMAN.
VERONICA
You want me to do it again? I think I could do it better.
TRUMAN
(coming back to reality)
No... thank you.
Truman picks up the cardigan.	They return to the car.
INT.	TRUMAN'S CAR.	NIGHT.
TRUMAN drives VERONICA back to her turf. She smokes a cigarette, flicking ash out of the window.
TRUMAN
Veronica, what do you know for sure?
VERONICA
For sure?
(taking a long drag on her cigarette as she gives the question due consideration)
The nuns at my school, they used to say, "The whole of life is faith."
Truman regards his companion in a new light. He comes to a stop at the corner where he picked her up.
VERONICA
(giving Truman an affectionate
peck on the cheek)
On the house.
INT.	HIGH SCHOOL CORRIDOR.	DAY, SEVENTEEN YEARS EARLIER.
Another televised flashback. The SEVENTEEN-YEAR-OLD TRUMAN stands reflectively beside Sylvia's open and vacated locker.
CHRISTOF (V.O.)
We removed all physical trace of her but we couldn't erase the memory... 
ANOTHER SHORT BURST OF FAST-FORWARD AND THEN THE PICTURE RETURNS TO NORMAL SPEED.
INT.	HIGH SCHOOL LIBRARY.	DAY
In a secluded corner of the library the SEVENTEEN-YEAR-OLD TRUMAN sits at a table surrounded by a stack of glossy women's magazines. By tearing out individual facial features - eyes. nose, mouth, ears, chin, hair - from photographs of YOUNG WOMEN in the magazine's advertisements, Truman has been able to improvise a composite picture of Sylvia.
The montage is a passable likeness although Truman is not completely satisfied with Sylvia's nose. He toys with several nose examples before reluctantly settling for one. He stares wistfully at the completed picture.
ANOTHER BURST OF FAST-FORWARD
INT.	SEVENTEEN-YEAR-OLD TRUMAN'S HOUSE.	DAY.
SEVENTEEN-YEAR-OLD TRUMAN enters the front door. His older sister, RAQUEL, has been awaiting his arrival.
CHRISTOF (V.O.)
When he decided to go after Sylvia, we were forced to intervene once again... 
TRUMAN
(excited)
I've got something to tell you, Sis.
RAQUEL
(adopting a low, serious tone)
I've got something to tell you too.
TRUMAN
(unable to contain his news)
I'm going to Australia.
RAQUEL
Mom's real sick.
Truman's face falls. As he enters the bedroom where his ill MOTHER lies gazing at the ceiling, we focus on his EXCHANGE STUDENT APPLICATION that he has inadvertently crushed in his hands.
THE FLASHBACK SEQUENCE OVER, WE RETURN TO THE PRESENT TIME WITH THE IMAGE NO LONGER APPEARING ON A TELEVISION SCREEN.
INT.	TRUMAN'S CAR.	NIGHT
TRUMAN turns into his street but stops several houses short of his own driveway and kills the car's engine. In the light of a streetlamp, Truman opens his briefcase and removes the framed photograph of his wife, MERYL. But he turns his wife's face away from him and opens the clasps on the back of the frame.
Removing the backing, he exposes the composite picture of SYLVIA we witnessed in the flashback of his youth, worn and faded by the years. With the frame on his lap, Truman retrieves a handful of paper fragments from his jacket. Noses. He tests the likeness of each one in turn. Unsatisfied that any of the new noses is an improvement, Truman tosses them out of his car window. We watch the paper fragments blowing in the breeze as Truman's car proceeds down the street and into his driveway.
EXT.	SYLVIA'S BEACH HOUSE.	DAY.
Close up on a nose. We pull back to reveal that the nose belongs to SYLVIA, seventeen years older than Truman's composite picture - slimmer in the face, wearing her hair shorter.
She is standing at the water's edge on a long, deserted windswept beach, several sailing dinghys pulled up beyond the high-water line. In the background, a solitary, white beachfront house - an other-worldliness to the idyllic scene.
Looking up into the sky, Sylvia's attention is drawn to a piece of paper carried on the ocean breeze. The paper catches on the mast of one of the sailing dinghys. A page from a newspaper, carrying a photograph of TRUMAN in the street where he
encountered his father. Sylvia retrieves the page. The article's headline reads, "TRUMAN'S FATE IN DOUBT".
Spying a MAN, late-thirties, kindly face, riding up to the beach house on an old bicycle, Sylvia secrets the page under her sweater. The man waves cheerfully as he comes to join her on the sand. Sylvia waves cheerfully back.
INT.	BAR SOMEWHERE.	NIGHT.
In a quiet bar, a WAITRESS patiently explains her viewpoint to the BARMAN. A PATRON on a barstool, eavesdrops.
WAITRESS
She was willing to lose him if it meant he could find himself.
(registering the barman's blank look)
Never mind.
EXT.	TRAIN STATION PARKING LOT.	MORNING.
TRUMAN sits in his car, about to lace his coffee. From inside the adjacent Elementary School gymnasium, he hears the familiar excited squeals and shouts of SCHOOL CHILDREN. Truman suddenly throws aside his miniature of Jack Daniels and sprints across the parking lot and into the school.
INT.	UTOPIA ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.	MORNING.
TRUMAN slams through the front doors into the reception area.
It is deserted, no one stationed at the administration desk, the corridors empty. He runs down a vacant corridor, pushing open classroom doors as he goes. They are all unoccupied.
Finally, he stands outside the gymnasium. The childrens' voices can still be heard. Truman takes a deep breath and bursts through the double doors.
The room is empty save for a large reel-to-reel tape recorder in the middle of the basketball court playing a continuous tape of childrens' voices. The recorder is attached to speakers on tall stands facing the ventilation ducts. Truman stares at the machine in disbelief.
EXT.	LOWER MANHATTAN STREET.	MORNING.
TRUMAN exits the subway, still lost in thought.	He stops at
the newstand and picks up a copy of Vanity Fair to resume his ritual search but his heart is not in it.
He starts his trek to work, pausing to stare at his reflection in the mirrored building, hoping that the Homeless Man will appear at his side once again. But no one joins him.
However, as Truman continues to stare, it is the building itself that takes his interest. An imposing forty-story office building, a black, sheer mirrored box clad in the kind of reflective glass that shields its occupants from the world, a building Truman passes every day.
As usual, a steady stream of EMPLOYEES and VISITORS enter and exit the building's high-ceilinged lobby past an intimidating security desk manned by two UNIFORMED GUARDS. Beyond security are banks of elevators, ferrying executives, clerical staff and delivery personnel to and from their floors of business.
Truman abruptly enters the building. He strides confidently past the security desk trying to look as if he belongs.
SECURITY GUARD 1
(to Truman)
Can I help?
TRUMAN
(sneaking a glance at the
building directory)
I	have an appointment at, er... Diamond Enterprises.
SECURITY GUARD 1
They went bust.
The second Security Guard is rising from his seat to block Truman's path to the elevators but Truman reads his mind and makes a dash for it.
He slips into an elevator just as the doors are closing, defeating the flailing arm of the pursuing guard. A WOMAN EXECUTIVE in the elevator looks in horror at Truman. The cause of her concern becomes all too apparent. Looking beyond the woman, Truman discovers that there is no back to the elevator car.
The elevator is simply an opening into the body of the building. Truman pushes past the Woman to be confronted with the fact that the entire office block is nothing but a giant, empty shell with no floors above the ground floor.
The PEOPLE Truman has just witnessed entering the other elevators are milling around a refreshment table, sitting on folding chairs, changing their clothes behind temporary curtained cubicles or lining up to re-enter the bogus elevator cars. Gradually, they all turn to gape at Truman, who in turn stares back, appalled.
The Security Guards suddenly appear at Truman's side and take him by the arm.
SECURITY GUARD 1
You gotta leave.
TRUMAN
(riveted by the equally-stunned
building occupants)
What're they doing?
SECURITY GUARD 2
You gotta leave.
The Guards frog-march Truman out of the huge facade towards an Emergency Exit.
TRUMAN
(not going quietly)
Just tell me what the hell's going on?
SECURITY GUARD 1
We're re-modelling.
TRUMAN
Like fuck!	What're they doing?
EXT.	LOWER MANHATTAN STREET.	DAY.
TRUMAN continues to struggle as the GUARDS usher him to the street.
TRUMAN
You don't tell me, I'll get you investigated!
SECURITY GUARD 2
Investigate what?	You're trespassing!
Truman sees there is no point in arguing further. His shouts are attracting the interest of PASSERS-BY. A thought occurs to him.
He starts to run along the street, suddenly entering another building at random. An office block with a bank on the ground floor. As he skirts the bank, he feels the eyes of the BANK STAFF and CUSTOMERS on him. Is he so suspicious-looking or were they expecting him?
Truman rushes to the elevators. The lights above the doors show all the elevators on upper floors. Frantic pressing
of the elevator button gets no response. Truman heads for the stairs but is intercepted by a BANK OFFICIAL who bars his way.
OFFICIAL
You can't--
TRUMAN
(anticipating his response)
--I know.
Truman backs away out of the office and continues to run down the streets of Lower Manhattan's financial district. Every building he encounters seems to have a SECURITY GUARD anticipating his arrival or a building OFFICIAL hanging a CLOSED FOR BUSINESS sign on the front door.
He feels the eyes of PEDESTRIANS. Is he simply drawing attention to himself by his behavior? Truman wheels around, trying to make eye contact with passers-by. They shy away. Truman stops still, his head reeling.
INT.	INSURANCE COMPANY.	DAY.
From the office window on the twelfth floor, TRUMAN can observe the glass building down the street. He ponders the black, mirrored box. LAWRENCE appears at his side.
TRUMAN
You ever been into the AMT Building?
LAWRENCE
(following Truman's gaze)
Not since they begun reconstruction.
(referring to the file
in Truman's hands)
What're you doing with that?
TRUMAN
(defensive)
I'm going to visit a site.
LAWRENCE
What for?
TRUMAN
Because I never do.
LAWRENCE
(placing a hand on Truman's arm)
That's why we got adjusters.
TRUMAN
(looking at Lawrence's hand
on his arm)
You got a problem with me going?
LAWRENCE
I got a problem with you not doing your job, Burbank. You already screwed up once this week.
TRUMAN
Let me worry about that.
Truman exits with the report. After waiting only a matter of seconds for an elevator, he impatiently enters the stairwell.
As soon as he disappears from sight, a grim CHRISTOF emerges from a nearby office, shadowed as always by CHLOE. They approach Lawrence with the familiarity of business associates.
LAWRENCE
680 West 89th.
Christof nods.	Chloe opens a flip-phone to make a call.
INT.	INSURANCE CO. - STAIRWELL.	DAY.
An out-of-breath TRUMAN arrives on the second floor landing of the stairwell to find two burly MOVERS blocking his path with a large office desk they are attempting to transport. Truman considers retracing his steps, then without warning clambers over the mahogany barrier.
MOVER 1
Hey, would it kill ya to wait?!
INT.	SUBWAY.	DAY.
TRUMAN paces impatiently on an empty subway platform with other frustrated passengers. He loses patience and suddenly turns and runs up the stairs.
INT.	TAXI CAB.	DAY.
TRUMAN sits seething in a traffic jam that exists for no apparent reason.
TRUMAN
(impatiently to driver)
Is there another way? Can't you get around this?
EXT.	A CHARRED APARTMENT BUILDING ON THE UPPER WEST SIDE.	DAY.
TRUMAN exits his taxi and takes in the scene. A partially burnt building, waterlogged, still faintly smoldering. Truman checks the address on his file. A small, serious-looking BOY straddles his bicycle on the sidewalk.
TRUMAN
(to the boy)
When was the fire?
BOY
(shrug)
Week ago.
TRUMAN
How come it's still smoking?
BOY
Started up again.
(dismissive)
Kids.
TRUMAN
(referring to his claims report)
Says here it burnt to the ground.
BOY
Wishful thinking maybe?
The boy is wise well beyond his years. Truman fixes him with a glare.
TRUMAN
Someone send you to tell me all this?
BOY
(unfazed)
You the one askin' questions.
The boy casually rides away.
EXT.	CITY PARK.	DAY.
TRUMAN wanders aimlessly through a city park, observing. We sense, truly observing for the first time.
A group of YOUTHS play a pick-up game of basketball. A YOUNG WOMAN walks a pair of AFGHAN HOUNDS. An OLD MAN answers the incessant questions of his GRANDCHILD. Nothing appears amiss.
EXT.	TIMES SQUARE.	DAY.
TRUMAN stands amidst a throng of TOURISTS and COMMUTERS marooned on Times Square. Mesmerized by the two fast-moving rivers of vehicles flowing through the intersection.
Truman stares down at the street, contemplating stepping out into the traffic. However as his foot is poised, the stream of cars that passed so close by seconds earlier, now appear to be giving him a wider berth. He steps off the sidewalk and.
to an acompaniment of car horns, begins to wander back and forth without fear through the traffic, confident that each vehicle will take evasive action.
Safely on the other side of the street, he stands in front of
the window of an electronics store.	He watches a local TV
news show covering the Santa Maria replica moored near Pier 13.
However Truman is forced to look away when he glimpses his own face on another TV taking a feed from a camcorder aimed out the store window. He shudders at his video reflection.
INT.	DIMLY-LIT ROOM SOMEWHERE.	DAY.
TRUMAN'S face stares out from a televison monitor. We slowly pull back to reveal that other smaller monitors surround the first until we find ourselves staring at a video wall in a room the size of a football field.
The curved bank of monitors, suspended by cables from the ceiling, gives the appearance of a giant patch-work mobile. Investigating the screens we discover surveillance pictures from all over New York City, covering every facet of Truman's life. Camera angles from the interior of Truman's house, his backyard, car, subway station, office, the deli he frequents, the seashore to which he is drawn, the park he visits with Veronica, the
abandoned freeway where he golfs with Marlon, many of the locations strangely devoid of people.
Beneath the video wall is a state-of-the-art mixing desk, its illuminated buttons glowing brightly in the gloom. Facing the desk, several OPERATORS in high-backed, high-tech swivel chairs, wearing the slimmest of headsets. SIMEON, a meticulous young man with a penetrating gaze, sits directly in front of the largest of the monitors, co-ordinating camera angles.
CHRISTOF stands over Simeon's shoulder, staring intently at the live picture of Truman now seated at a streetside cafe, continuing to inspect his surroundings. CHLOE hovers in the background.
There is an uncomfortable silence in the control room as the production crew feel themselves under scrutiny for the first time. Christof leans forward and talks soothingly into a microphone on the control panel.
CHRISTOF
... Everybody stay focused... remember who you are... 
EXT.	STREETSIDE CAFE, LITTLE ITALY.	DAY.
TRUMAN sits alone at the table, still looking for a false move.
A DELIVERY MAN unloads boxes from the back of his truck and carries them into a Restaurant Supply store. Further down the street CONSTRUCTION WORKERS take their time tending to an electrical repair in an exposed manhole. A POSTAL WORKER does his rounds. An OLD WOMAN struggles with two heavy shopping bags. Everybody appears natural, places to go.
Truman turns his attention to a group of ITALIAN-LOOKING MEN at the only other occupied table at the cafe. We see extreme close-ups as Truman scans the men's faces for any sign of phoniness. They are talking loudly, making suggestive comments to the WAITRESS and generally showing off like schoolboys. Their behavior passes the test, all seems genuine.
Truman idly regards his three-stone wedding ring with which he has been fidgeting.
INT.	CONTROL ROOM.	DAY.
The on-air monitor shows TRUMAN from the ring's POV, revealing that the small center diamond contains a miniature, hidden
camera.	Truman suspects nothing.
He looks up to find two well-to-do 3OGGERS, out for a lunchtime run, making their way down the street towards the cafe. Truman happens to glance at the sneakers of one of the joggers. He springs to his feet and blocks the joggers' path.
CHRISTOF
(staring at the monitor)
Damn!
Unseen by Christof, his Assistant Director, Simeon takes a moment of pleasure from the older man's distress.
EXT.	STREETSIDE CAFE, LITTLE ITALY.	DAY.
TRUMAN
(to the jogger with
the familiar sneakers)
Small world.
JOGGER 1
(attempting to sidestep Truman)
Excuse me.
Truman blocks the man a second time.
TRUMAN
You don't remember? Two days ago I gave you my meatball sandwich in the park. You were in a wheelchair. Same sneakers.
An almost subliminal flashback appears in Truman's head confirming that the JOGGER and the HOMELESS MAN in the wheelchair two days earlier are one and the same.
TRUMAN
(commenting ironically on his
new-found mobility)
A miracle!
JOGGER 2
(coming to his companion's aid)
Get the hell outta here.
The second jogger pushes Truman back against the cafe table causing him to stumble.
EXT.	WAREHOUSE - MARLON'S WORK.	DAY.
MARLON is loading boxes of candy into the back of his van.
TRUMAN hurries up to him.
TRUMAN
Marlon. I've gotta talk to you.
MARLON
(surprised)
Truman!	Sorry, I'm up against it today.
TRUMAN
I've fallen over something, Marlon.
Something to do with my Dad. I think.
MARLON
(looking at him for the first time)
Are you okay? You look like shit.
TRUMAN
(ignoring the inquiries
about his health)
It's big, Marlon. You wouldn't believe who's in on it.
MARLON
(distracted)
In on what?
TRUMAN
There's no point trying to show you, they cover their tracks too well. But I've been going into a lotta strange buildings, seeing a lotta familiar faces, y'know what I mean?
MARLON
(still engrossed in his own problems) Something's definitely in the air. My last delivery, a kid got crushed to death. tilting a vending machine. They won't even let me take the rest of the day off.
TRUMAN
Do it, anyway.
Marlon scoffs at the suggestion then realizes Truman isn't joking.
TRUMAN
I'm deadly serious. Marlon. We can't talk here. I'm being followed.
MARLON
(suddenly concerned)
Who?
TRUMAN
I don't know. They look just like regular people.
(producing a notebook from
his jacket pocket)
But I've been writing down numbers - license plates, taxi numbers, ID numbers - the same ones keep cropping up over and over.
MARLON
Is someone leanin' on you, Tru?	Cos I got
some friends here, they owe me.	We can lean back.
(pointing out a taxi
parked outside the yard)
Is he one of them?
TRUMAN
(anxious)
I don't know. Could be. One thing's certain. The key is spontoneity. Be unpredictable. They can't stand that. That's why we've got to get outta here. Can you come with me?
MARLON
(weakening)
Christ, Truman. You're gonna get both our asses fired.
