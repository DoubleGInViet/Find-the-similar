Marlon shuts his van and gets in. Truman enters the passenger side.
MARLON
Where're we going?
TRUMAN
The beach.
INT.	CONFERENCE ROOM.	DAY.
CHRISTOF is in deep conversation with two executives. MOSES, a contemporary of Christof but more jaded and debauched-looking and ROMAN, a fresh-faced, younger man. CHLOE hovers in the background. A monitor, suspended from the ceiling shows a surveillance shot of TRUMAN and MARLON pulling into a beach parking lot in Marlon's van.
The glass conference room looks out onto the vast control facility where SIMEON continues to call the shots, all too aware of the closed-door discussion taking place in the background.
CHRISTOF
(marveling, excitedly referring
to Truman on the monitor)
I can't believe how much he's shoved down. That he sensed the significance at aged seven and clung to it so fiercely.
Roman paces, agitated, unimpressed.	Moses, mnore respectful.
CHRISTOF
(gesturing to the clifftop on the monitor pointedly excluding Roman from the conversation)
You remember, Moses, it used to end right there, before the expansion.
ROMAN
(unable to contain his anxiety
any longer)
Christof, the cracks are starting to show.
CHRISTOF
(reassuring, keeping
himself in check)
I'll paper over them.
CHLOE
(coming to the defense of her mentor) Truman's had bouts of paranoia before and recovered.
ROMAN
(adamant, faintly hysterical) No, not like this. It's compromised. Becoming unwatchable.
Too much for Christof.	He wheels on the young man.
CHRISTOF
Fear? Doubt? Is that what you have trouble watching? Perhaps you don't like watching yourself.
Roman is stung into silence.
MOSES
(realizing his colleague is in
over his head, including Chloe
to save Roman's face)
Why don't you two wait outside?
Reluctantly Roman and Chloe exit and join Simeon at the video wall.
CHRISTOF
(instantly more comfortable in the company of a man his own age)
He's jumped the rails, Moses, that's all. We'll get him back on.
MOSES
You know why they're so nervous. The birth of Truman's child is going to double revenue. For God's sake don't let him upstage you.
(indicating Simeon through
the glass walls)
You've been grooming a successor.
CHRISTOF
He's not ready.
MOSES
Him or you?
CHRISTOF
(jaw setting firm, referring
to Truman on the monitor)
You can't pull him back in without me.
(more reflective)
He's just acting out of character.
MOSES
What if he's in character? What if he's starting to act in character at last? Have you ever considered that?
EXT.	LONG ISLAND BEACH.	DAY.
TRUMAN runs down the beach towards the cliff he attempted to scale as a seven-year-old boy.
EXT.	CLIFFTOP.	DAY.
TRUMAN sits on the clifftop, staring out at the view his father had been so desperate for him not to see twenty-seven years
earlier. However the deserted bay beyond is exactly as his father described - almost identical to its neighbor. MARLON, laboring, crests the rise and joins his friend on the clifftop.
MARLON
What're we doing here, Truman?
TRUMAN
This is where it started.
MARLON
Where what started?
TRUMAN
Things.	Things that don't fit.	Loose threads.
False steps.	Slips of the tongue.
MARLON
(irritated)
Make sense, Truman.	You going religious on me?
TRUMAN
(tears of bitterness welling in his eyes) My father didn't want me to see what was over here. Whatever it was, it's gone now. I never shoulda listened to him that day. I knew it was wrong.
We see a quick flashback of SEVEN-YEAR-OLD TRUMAN on the cliff-face twenty-seven years earlier.
TRUMAN
There were a hundred people on the beach that day. Everybody knew what was going on except me.
MARLON
I don't want to put you down but why would anybody go to all this trouble over you?
TRUMAN
Maybe I've been mistaken for somebody else.
(a memory triggered)
A couple of years ago, I tried to get hold of a copy of Time Magazine. The week before an ad said, "Next Week: Truman Burbank and the Lost Generation".
Marlon shrugs, unimpressed.
TRUMAN
A guy with the same name as me in Time Magazine. It ain't a common name so I looked out for it. But the day it came
out, every newstand was sold out. No library had it. I even wrote off for a back-issue. Never seen a copy to this day.
Marlon remains unconvinced.
TRUMAN
Maybe I'm being set up for something. You ever feel like that, Marlon? Like your whole life has been building to something?
Marlon looks skeptically at Truman.	He hasn't had that feeling.
MARLON
(becoming testy)
A coincidence. Haven't you ever heard of a coincidence?
TRUMAN
I'm a walking coincidence. I can't count 'em. No something's happening, Marlon. I've got to get to the bottom of it.
MARLON
(shaking his head in exasperation)
Of what?!	Why're you doing this to yourself?
TRUMAN
I'm scared, Marlon. I'm as scared as hell. But I've never felt more alive. It's just like she said.
MARLON
(suddenly intrigued)
Who?
TRUMAN
It doesn't matter.	She was too beautiful for here.
Now Marlon is really confused.
TRUMAN
Can you lend me some money?	A hundred bucks.
MARLON
All I got on me is the takings from the machines.
Why do you need it?
TRUMAN
I'm going away for a while.
INT.	SYLVIA'S BEACH HOUSE.	DUSK.
The comfortably furnished room of a writer. Walls lined with books. Desk overlooking the sea, strewn with notes, photos and other reference material. Sylvia's name on the spine of several published volumes. Pages of unfinished manuscript, handwritten in blue ink.
SYLVIA stands at a bookcase, looking for inspiration. As she pulls out a book, a magazine falls to the floor. Truman's missing copy of Time Magazine. His face on the cover with the headline, "Truman Burbank and the Lost Generation".
Sylvia retrieves the magazine. In front of a nearby mirror, she holds Truman's photographed face next to her own, for a moment imagining them together. Then, catching herself, she quickly lowers the magazine, left alone with her own reflection.
INT.	TRUMAN'S HOUSE.	NIGHT.
We see TRUMAN's disturbed face reflected in the screen of his television set, montaged over that of ROBIN LEACH, host of "Lifestyles Of The Rich And Famous". MERYL, wearing her robe, head against Truman's chest, sips from a bottle of beer.
MERYL
(attempting to open him up)
What's going on, Truman?	You're not yourself.
TRUMAN
(vague)
Maybe you just don't know me very well.
INT.	DINING ROOM SOMEWHERE.	NIGHT.
CHRISTOF eats a sumptuous meal in an ornate private dining room with an elegant WOMAN, thirty years his junior. Playing silently on a monitor on an antique side table is a surveillance shot of TRUMAN and MERYL slumped in front of their television.
CHLOE, enters the room and nods an apology to Christof's dinner companion - a woman her own age. Christof's companion shrugs resignedly. Christof registers Chloe's thinly disguised resentment, enjoying the rivalry.
Chloe inserts a cassette tape into a nearby VCR. Christof wipes his mouth with his napkin and picks up his wine glass as he gives the television his full attention. A commercial for
"GLOBAL TRAVEL" begins to play.
INT.	TRUMAN'S HOUSE.	NIGHT.
TRUMAN continues to watch "Lifestyles" restlessly. However, as he goes to get up from the sofa, MERYL starts to slide down his chest towards his lap.
MERYL
We could do it right here, like we used to.
The program cuts to a commercial break. The commercial is for "Global Travel".
NARRATOR
(from television)
Travelling Down Under? Global Travel is turning rates to Australia upside down. Round Trip to Sydney only $829. One way, $465. Global Travel at Broadway and 44th... 
Truman perks up at the commercial while Meryl's attention is elsewhere.
TRUMAN
(abruptly getting up)
Lemme go to the bathroom.
MERYL
Don't be too long.
Truman exits the living room. However, on his way to the bathroom he hesitates at the kitchen table. He surreptitiously lifts the platic-coated plaid tablecloth to reveal numerous bills laid out flat beneath it to keep the stash hidden.
INT.	CHRISTOF'S BEDROOM.	DAWN.
CHLOE pulls back long, white silk drapes to reveal a spectacular view overlooking the Hollywood Hills. CHRISTOF rouses from his enormous round bed. His DINNER COMPANION also stirs, waving coyly to Chloe as she modestly covers herself, only mildly perturbed by the intrusion. Chloe switches on the television set in the extravagent bedroom. Playing on the set are TRUMAN and MERYL still fast asleep in their own bed.
CHRISTOF
What happened overnight?
CHLOE
He couldn't do it, even on the sofa.
CHRISTOF
(smiling to himself)
God, that thing of his must be psychic.
(matter-of-fact)
He didn't masturbate?
CHLOE
Not for the last two inonths.
Chloe exits and Christof climbs out of bed.
INT.	TRUMAN'S HOUSE.	MORNING.
MERYL emerges from the bathroom, ready for work, surprised to find TRUMAN sitting at the kitchen table.
MERYL
(rubbing ointment into her wrists)
Aren't you gonna be late?
TRUMAN
I got a call in the area.
(nodding to her wrists)
What's the case?	Anything interesting?
MERYL
(dispassionate)
Rape on the subway.
Truman's eyes widen. We see a quick flashback in Truman's head of the two YOUTHS assaulting the WOMAN on his train.
MERYL
They're guilty as hell but they'll walk. No witnesses. Her word against theirs.
(picking up her bag to leave)
Maybe we could meet for lunch today.
Meryl gives him an affectionate kiss and exits the back door. Truman waits for the sound of Meryl's car to disappear down the road and exits himself.
INT.	COURT BUILDING.	MORNING.
TRUMAN enters the courtroom building. A crush of DEFENDENTS, FAMILIES, ATTORNEYS and POLICE OFFICERS. Truman goes to enter
a courtroom but a SECURITY GUARD blocks his path.
SECURITY GUARD
You a witness?
TRUMAN
Er, yes... 
(suddenly losing heart)
No, no I'm not.
SECURITY GUARD
Closed session.
Before the guard can move him on. Truman sneaks a look at proceedings through the courtroom door window.
He recognizes the two YOUTHS sitting at the defendent's table. A PROSECUTOR is on his feet, addressing the JURY. MERYL is working attentively at her stenotype machine, her fingers rapidly pressing the keys. However, Truman notices a glaring omission. There is no paper emerging from Meryl's machine. The roll of paper tape sits on the floor beside her chair leg.
INT.	TRAVEL AGENCY.	DAY.
The EMPLOYEES and CUSTOMERS inside GLOBAL TRAVEL are all doing
a	last-minute primp, fixing their hair and checking their clothes. Suddenly, in unison, they take their positions and begin working. As TRUMAN enters GLOBAL TRAVEL, one CUSTOMER looks up a fraction too quickly, anticipating his arrival.
Truman takes a seat at the only unoccupied desk, opposite a female TRAVEL AGENT. Feeling uneasy about a surveillance camera in the corner of the room, he nervously obscures his face with his hand.
TRUMAN
I wanna book a flight to Australia.
AGENT
Where exactly?
TRUMAN
(believing she is being
deliberately obtuse)
Australia.
AGENT
(a trace of condescension)
Where in Australia?	What city?
TRUMAN
Sorry, Sydney.	Sydney, Australia.	That's right.
AGENT
(entering the destination in her computer)
For how many?
TRUMAN
(finding the question suspicious)
One.
AGENT
When do you want to leave, remembering, of course, that you do lose a day on the way there?
TRUMAN
(more urgent than he intended)
Today.
AGENT
(reading off her computer screen) I'm sorry. I don't have anything for a week.
TRUMAN
(suspicious)
A week.
AGENT
(patiently explaining)
It's the busy season.
TRUMAN
(paranoia showing)
You sure you're not trying to keep me here? You are a travel agent, aren't you? Your job is to help people travel, not keep 'em where they are.
(pointing to the agent's
name tag, "DORIS - Travel Agent")
Or maybe you're a different kind of agent, Doris?
AGENT
(showing amazing restraint)
I do have a fabulous rate on a cruise ship departing for Australia tomorrow. But you wouldn't want to do that.
TRUMAN
Why wouldn't I?
AGENT
I thought you were in a hurry.
TRUMAN
(calming down)
That's right.
AGENT
You want to book the flight?
Truman pulls out a wad of money from his pocket and several rolls of quarters from Marlon's vending machines. The agent looks askance at the pile of cash.
TRUMAN
You were expecting me, weren't you?
The travel agent ignores the question and prints the ticket.
AGENT
It's non-refundable.
EXT.	SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA.	DAY.
CHRISTOF stands with a PRODUCTION MANAGER, mid-thirties, on the forecourt of the Sydney Opera House, its sail-like roofs soaring above them. Framing the background, the coathanger-shaped Sydney Harbor Bridge.
PROD. MANAGER
(unable to conceal his pride)
Happy?
Christof gives a grudgingly complimentary nod.
CHRISTOF
(staring out at the pleasure
craft littering the harbor)
Can we contain him long enough?
PROD. MANAGER
I think so.
Christof looks skyward at the cottonwool clouds above the harbor.
PROD. MANAGER
(anticipating his next question)
He flies at night.	Thick cloud cover to
disorient him.	Hopefully we'll knock him
out with complimentary cocktails, pull the
shades down during the movies.	He'll never know.
Christof gives another grudging nod of approval. The Production Manager is beckoned by a group of CONSTRUCTION WORKERS who are putting the finishing touches to a corner of the Opera House. CHLOE drifts to Christof's side, a Watchman TV in her hand.
CHLOE
(referring to the surrounding scene)
Why go to all the trouble?
Christof glances at the TV screen in her hand, showing TRUMAN sitting in his office gazing at his composite picture of SYLVIA.
CHRISTOF
He believes she has the answer.
CHLOE
Why not just tell him she's dead?
CHRISTOF
It's too late for that.	That won't satisfy
him. He's going to have to find out for himself. See it with his own eyes. Right now he needs something genuine.
(rueful, all too aware
of the contradiction)
Even if we have to fake it.
INT.	INSURANCE COMPANY.	DAY.
Close up on typewriting appearing on a page.
"Please accept my resignation from American Life & Accident, Inc. to take effect immediately.
Yours tru"
TRUMAN gets up from the typewriter in mid-word and strolls to a fellow AGENT's desk.
TRUMAN
(to agent, picking up
a dictionary)
"Yours truly... "	You spell "truly"
"l... y" or "e... l... y"?
INSURANCE AGENT
I always write "Yours faithfully... "
Truman finds the appropriate page in the dictionary and gazes at the entry for a long moment. He looks up, staring into the middle distance. His eyes widen as something clicks in his mind. Suddenly LAWRENCE snatches the dictionary from his hand.
LAWRENCE
Where the hell have you been, Burbank?
What the hell's going on?
TRUMAN
That's what I'd like to know, Lawrence.
The AGENTS in the other cubicles turn in their direction.
TRUMAN
I was just about to resign.	Isn't that
a laugh? I just realized there's nothing to resign from, is there?
LAWRENCE
Listen, don't bother with the resignation.
Just get the fuck outta here.
TRUMAN
(addressing the whole office)
Why're you all pretending?	Huh?
(gesturing to a computer terminal) What is this a front for? Why aren't I in on the joke? Was I away that day?!
Noting two colleagues exchanging a look, he pulls the computer off the desk to get their attention. It lands on the floor with an expensive crash.
TRUMAN
(hysterical)
I'm talking to you!	Who am I?!
LAWRENCE
(taken aback by the sudden violent act) You better get outta here or I'm calling Security.
TRUMAN
(mimicking)
"Security!	I'm calling Security".
Truman picks up the framed photograph from his desk, containing
SYLVIA's hidden likeness. Suddenly he wheels on Lawrence, pinning him to a cubicle wall.
TRUMAN
You don't believe a single word you're saying!
(to the assembled group)
None of you do!
(suddenly talking to a sprinkler head in the ceiling)
You hear me?!
We see Truman's manic face from the sprinkler head's POV. Truman stomps off down the corridor, other Insurance Agents giving him a wide berth. He shoves computers, desk lamps and pot holders off desks as he goes.
EXT.	MANHATTAN STREET.	DAY.
TRUMAN steps out of the office, suddenly able to breathe again, pleased to be outdoors despite the gloomy sky overhead.
INT.	CONTROL ROOM SOMEWHERE.	DAY.
CHRISTOF is once again standing at the picture window in the dimly-lit control room where we first encountered him. Behind him, the fronds of the palm tree sway in a gentle breeze. The sky, a cloudless, cobalt blue in sharp contrast to the overcast day in New York City.
SIMEON, co-ordinating camera angles, sits in front of the largest of the monitors that shows a live picture of TRUMAN stuck in his car in gridlock.
SIMEON
(talking quietly into a
slim headset)
... and back to the close-up... 
CHLOE's attention is focused on a subsidiary monitor displaying a freeze frame of TRUMAN reading the dictionary a few minutes earlier.
CHLOE
(to a hard-bitten Operator, staring at the dictionary)
Do you think he sees the entry?
OPERATOR
Hard to tell.
CHRISTOF
(sarcastic)
Why don't we ask him?
CHLOE
(snapping back, referring to the book)
I don't know how it got there!
(to Operator)
Enhance.
Christof turns his back on the screen and stares out the window.
We focus on an enhanced picture of the dictionary's text.
EXT.	SUBURBAN STREET IN QUEENS.	DAY.
TRUMAN drives erratically down a quiet suburban street.
On the sidewalk up ahead, he spies a YOUNG MOTHER pushing an INFANT in a baby carriage.
Truman suddenly swerves sharply and jumps the curb in front of the mother and child, the car straddling the sidewalk. He has the driver's door open almost before the Oldsmobile has come to a halt. Truman dashes from the car and plucks the infant from the carriage while the mother stands rooted to the spot.
The startled infant immediately begins to wail as Truman holds the crying bundle in both hands above his head.
TRUMAN
(to the Mother, motioning to the sidewalk)
Say my name or I'll smash its head open.
The young mother, frozen with fright, does not reply.
TRUMAN
(vehement)
Say my name!
YOUNG MOTHER
(composing herself,
reaching out for her child)
Please, give him to me... 
TRUMAN
(screaming above the baby's cries)
Say my name!	You know my name!	Say it!
YOUNG MOTHER
(bewildered)
I don't know you.
The commotion has attracted the attention of an OLD MAN across the street, watering his garden. He drops his hose and hurries towards the fracas. Halfway across the street, the old man stops in his tracks as he sees the baby, perilously poised in the air.
TRUMAN
(hysterical)
I mean it!	I'm ready to do it!
What's my name?!!
Truman lifts the screaming baby as far above his head as he can, his arms shaking, fighting the urge to dash the fragile innocent to the concrete. We see a view of the scene from the POV of a streetlight. The young mother, recognizing Truman's seriousness, opens her mouth to speak but no sound comes.
TRUMAN
(entreating the young
woman, tears in his eyes)
This is your last chance!
The anguish in his voice convinces us that Truman is truly on the brink. The young woman now has tears rolling down her cheeks. She is at a loss, powerless.
TRUMAN
(his entire body shaking)
What... is... my... name?!
The young woman mumbles but is unable to supply the name. Truman, arms shaking, face red with rage, realizes he can't go through with it. With everything he has, he gathers himself. After what seems like an age, he ever so slowly lowers the child into the safety of the mother's outstretched arms.
YOUNG MOTHER
(clutching the baby to
her breast, without thinking)
Thank you, Truman.
Truman shudders at the sound of his name and backs away from the young woman, as if it is she who now represents the threat.
He jumps into his car and slams it into gear, driving over the sidewalk and back onto the street. The young woman and the old man stare after Truman's car as it roars away.
INT.	TRUMAN'S CAR.	DAY.
As TRUMAN drives, he stares, paranoid, at seemingly innocuous features in his Oldsmobile - his rearview mirror, steering wheel insignia, speedometer, airconditioning ducts - and peers up at the streetlamps lining the roadway.
INT.	SYLVIA'S BEACH HOUSE.	DAY.
A	dozen-or-so of SYLVIA'S FRIENDS, including the MAN we have seen before, sit around a table on the balcony in the afternoon sun, talking animatedly. A TEN-YEAR-OLD SON of one of the guests has strayed into the living room and switched on the television set hidden away in an antique bureau.
SYLVIA. emerging from the kitchen, is taken aback by what she sees playing on the screen. The MAN on the balcony catches her look as she swiftly switches off the TV. She gently takes the child's hand and leads him outside.
EXT.	TRUMAN'S BACKYARD.	DAY.
TRUMAN, staring at the freeway from the bottom of the garden.
doesn't bother to look up as MERYL approaches.
TRUMAN
(referring to a distant
car on the expressway)
See that car way down there? I bet it's a Suburu station wagon.
Meryl looks idly	over	the fence at the approaching car.
Finally a Suburu	station	wagon motors by.	Meryl is	unimpressed.
Truman turns his	back	on	the Expressway to	continue	his	game.
TRUMAN
I predict the next four cars will be a
white Honda Civic, a blue and white
Dodge Dart with the front hubcap missing,
a Volkswagon Beetle with a dented fender and a motorcycle.
Meryl doesn't wish to participate in the game and makes for the house. Truman holds her arm, forcing her to watch. He turns to check his prediction. A convoy of cars approaches.
TRUMAN
There's the Honda... the Dodge... here comes the dented Beetle... 
Meryl's attention wavers.	Truman tightens his grip.
TRUMAN
Look, damn you!
Following the VW is a school bus.
MERYL
(mocking)
Where's the motorcycle?
Truman is momentarily disappointed. Meryl seizes her chance and heads for the house. Truman follows her inside.
TRUMAN
(yelling after her)
Don't you want to know how I did that?
Maybe you already know.	Is that it?
Behind Truman's back, a motorcycle putters by.
INT.	TRUMAN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN.	DAY.
MERYL is pouring herself ice tea when TRUMAN enters.
MERYL
Where have you been? I've been calling you all day.
TRUMAN
Have you been concerned, Meryl?	Nice name.
"Meryl".	I always liked it.
MERYL
(matching his sarcasm)
Nice of you to say so after eight years.
TRUMAN
Actress's name, isn't it?	What's your
real name?
MERYL
(rolling her eyes)
Oh, God.	What's got into you?
TRUMAN
Take a break. Meryl
(a knowing, almost foolish grin)
I	know.
MERYL
I invited Marlon and Rita for a barbeque Sunday.
I thought I'd make my potato salad.	Remind me... 
TRUMAN
(irritated)
Drop it, I said.	It's over.
MERYL
(rambling on)
... we need more charcoal.
TRUMAN
Shut up!
MERYL
I'm gonna take a shower.
TRUMAN
(catching her wrist)
No.	We're going for a drive.
MERYL
What?!
Despite her protests, Truman drags Meryl out the back door and towards his car.
TRUMAN
(as he shoves her into
the Oldsmobile)
For years I've been saying I want to go
some place, well now I'm ready to go. Let's just jump in the car and go.
INT.	TRUMAN'S CAR.	DAY.
TRUMAN holds MERYL's wrist to stop her exiting the car and accelerates out of the driveway in reverse without looking.
TRUMAN
(as they speed down the suburban street)
I thought maybe, Atlantic City.
MERYL
(trying to mask her anxiety)
You hate gambling.
TRUMAN
That's right.	I do, don't I?
MERYL
So why do you wanna go?
TRUMAN
Cos I never have. That's why you go places, isn't it? Cos you're curious. I haven't been curious since I was seven years old, y'know that? Back then you'd have to nail me to the floor to keep me in one place.
INT.	CONTROL ROOM.	DAY.
All eyes watch the large monitor as surveillance cameras track Truman's speeding car.
CHRISTOF
How long to take Atlantic City out of mothballs?
SIMEON
We could be up and running... three hours maybe.
CHRISTOF
Give me a number five gridlock on the
Jersey Turnpike.
INT.	TRUMAN'S CAR.	DUSK.
TRUMAN and MERYL are hemmed in by a traffic snarl on the New Jersey Turnpike. We observe the Oldsmobile on a television lens from the POV of a tail-light on the car ahead.
TRUMAN
(a manic edge to his voice)
So much traffic, this time of day. Does that strike you as peculiar?
On the side of the road, TWO MOTORISTS, are arguing over a minor collision.
TRUMAN
(sneering at the sight of
the motorists)
Look at them. You believe they're fighting? I don't believe it.
(shouting out the window
to the motorists)
Why don't you slug him, really make it authentic?
Without warning, Truman suddenly exits the freeway.	But
his move is anticipated. At the end of the offramp a pack of cars suddenly appears. Other vehicles fill the gap behind.
TRUMAN
(to Meryl, marveling) Blocked at every turn. Beautifully synchronized, don't you agree?
MERYL
(incredulous)
You blaming me for the traffic?
TRUMAN
Should I?
MERYL
You've never been on this road before.
You don't know what it's like.
TRUMAN
(manic)
That's true. We could be stuck here for hours. Could be like this all the way to Atlantic City.
Truman suddenly veers the Oldsmobile onto the sidewalk.
MERYL
What the hell are you doing?
TRUMAN
You're right. Let's go back. I'm sorry. I don't know what got into me.
Truman rejoins the New Jersey Turnpike, heading back towards Queens, the roadway now relatively free of traffic.
MERYL
Would you please slow down, Truman?
Truman floors the Oldsmobile. The car flies past the exit for Route 276. He continues along the Jersey Turnpike.
MERYL
Truman, that was the turnoff!
TRUMAN
I've changed my mind again. What's Maine like this time of year?! I've never been to Maine.
(Truman looks up through the
windshield at a helicopter
tracking his progress)
Or let's just see where the road takes us.
MERYL
(pleading)
Let me out, Truman. You're not right in the head. You wanna destroy yourself, you do it on your own!
TRUMAN
(eerily calm)
I think I'd like a little company.
INT.	CONTROL ROOM.	DUSK.
CHRISTOF, CHLOE, SIMEON and the other OPERATORS follow Truman's progress from a helicopter shot - the Oldsmobile optically circled to ease identification. Christof jabs his finger at the rapidly thinning traffic surrounding Truman's vehicle.
CHRISTOF
(to Simeon)
What the hell is wrong with the "carousel"?
Keep them together.
SIMEON
(agitated)
They're rusty.	We can't keep up.
(rueful aside)
We don't know where he's going any more.
CHLOE
Oncoming is very thin.
INT.	TRUMAN'S CAR.	DUSK.
As he speeds erratically, TRUMAN glances at the streets either side of the freeway, where he discovers a distinct lack of moving traffic.
TRUMAN
(to the anxious Meryl at his side) Look down there, Meryl!... No cars! I don't
run into traffic.	The traffic follows me around.
(excited by his discovery)
We're in a moving pack, don't you see?
Truman abruptly exits the rapidly emptying freeway.
INT.	CONTROL ROOM.	DUSK.
CHRISTOF
(enthusing)
He's so close!	It's tantilizing!
CHLOE
You want to pull him over?
CHRISTOF
No police.	Not yet.	We shadow him.
We don't want him to panic.
CHLOE
He's trying to outrun the traffic.
CHRISTOF
He's trying to outrun the world. Keep him on this route.
(to Simeon who is consulting
someone on his headset)
Are we ready?
Simeon nods. Executives, MOSES and ROMAN have entered the control room. They hover nervously in the background.
INT.	TRUMAN'S CAR, WESTCHESTER.	DUSK.
TRUMAN is forced to slow once again behind a line of other cars at a police roadblock. At the head of the line, the cars are being turned around by POLICE OFFICERS, who are also contending with a swarm of NEWS REPORTERS and TELEVISION CREWS.
TRUMAN
(to Meryl)
It's hard to go places, isn't it?
MERYL
There's been an accident, Truman. We have to go back.
TRUMAN
No.	There's no accident.	It'S just more stalling.
Truman slows beside a POLICE OFFICER.
TRUMAN
What's going on?
OFFICER
(grim-faced, indicating the nearby
Indian Point nuclear power plant)
Leak at the plant.	They had to shut her down.
TRUMAN
Is there any way around?
OFFICER
The whole area's being evacuated.	A precaution.
Truman falls in line behind the cars making a U-turn when, all of a sudden, he guns his car and swerves past the barricade.
EXT.	SYLVIA'S BEACH HOUSE.	DUSK.
In the twilight sun, SYLVIA'S GUESTS wander up the gravel path, leading away from the beach house, the younger children carried in their parents' arms. Hanging back from the rest of the group, Sylvia's admirer, wheeling his bicycle, turns back
to the house. As the MAN is about to lean his bicycle against the side of the beach house, he looks in a window.
Lit by a blue-glow, SYLVIA sits transfixed by the television playing in her antique bureau, the screen obscured from our view. She is unaware of the man's face at the window.
Recognizing what is playing on the screen, the man regards Sylvia with a resigned smile. He mounts the bicycle and rides back up the path.
EXT.	NUCLEAR POWER PLANT.	DUSK.
Truman's car slides to a stop, blocked by Hazardous Waste vehicles straddling the roadway leading up to the power plant, the pursuing police car blocking his retreat. TRUMAN flees the
car, leaving MERYL in the passenger seat.
MERYL
Truman!!	Come back!!
Truman bursts past the alien-looking HAZARDOUS WASTE WORKERS in their protective suits carrying detection instruments. The workers give chase in their cumbersome suits, trying to cut off his path to the power plant. As he crests a slight rise beyond the plant, he is finally tackled to the ground. However, peering through the long grass, Truman is able to make out the lights of a cityscape in the distance.
INT.	CONTROL ROOM.	DUSK.
CHRISTOF, a trace of panic in his eyes, turning to CHLOE.
CHRISTOF
Did he see it?
CHLOE
I don't think so.
The reason for Christof's concern becomes all too apparent as the helicopter passes over the power plant, where the struggling TRUMAN is being escorted away. We see an aerial shot from the helicopter as it emerges directly above the Sydney skyline.
INT.	TRUMAN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN.	NIGHT.
MERYL and TRUMAN sit at their kitchen table. Truman stoic, tears rolling down Meryl's cheeks. Truman's airline ticket torn to shreds on the table in front of them.
MERYL
Let me get you some help, Truman. You're not well.
TRUMAN
(ignoring her tears and medical advice)
Why do you want to have a child with me?
You can't stand me.
MERYL
That's not true.
TRUMAN
(suddenly angry)
Don't lie to me!
Truman's raised voice backs Meryl to her feet. Truman follows, getting in her face.
TRUMAN
Tell me what's happening?!
MERYL
(frightened but remaining poised) I thought you knew everything. What could I tell you?
TRUMAN
(backing her up against
the kitchen bench)
You're part of this, aren't you?!
Meryl grabs a kitchen knife from a wooden block to protect herself.
MERYL
Truman, you're scaring me!
Truman looks in her eyes and, with surprising swiftness, grabs her wrist and disarms her.
TRUMAN
No, you're scaring me, Meryl!
Truman grabs Meryl by the hair and turns the knife on her. While pressing the blade to Meryl's throat, Truman starts to march her around the room, talking to the walls, light fixtures, a mirror, doorknob, framed picture, blank television.
TRUMAN
Stop this now or I kill your leading lady.
(to a lamp)
I know you can hear me.
INT.	CONTROL ROOM.	NIGHT.
CHRISTOF and the OTHERS watch the monitors spellbound as TRUMAN looks directly into one camera lens after another. ROMAN is the first to crack.
ROMAN
(entreating Christof)
Get somebody in there!
CHRISTOF
(quiet but firm)
No.
SIMEON
(siding with the executive,
showing his true colors)
She's in trouble!	We've got to help her!
Christof, never taking his eyes from the monitor, leans into the microphone.
INT.	TRUMAN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN.	NIGHT.
We see an extreme close up of MERYL's ear. Unheard by TRUMAN, from her inner car, we hear a familiar voice.
CHRISTOF (O.C.)
He's bluffing.	Call his bluff.
MERYL
(in reply to the voice in her
head, half-strangled due to the
pressure of the knife)
Do something... 
Upon hearing her remark, Truman's eyes widen. Sensing that she too is addressing a third person, he jerks her head around to read her face.
TRUMAN
(wild-eyed)
Who are you talking to?!
MERYL
(incredulous)
You're the one talking to the walls!
TRUMAN
No. You said, "Do something." Who were you talking to? I swear I'll kill you, if you don't tell me.
Meryl takes the chance to spin out of his grasp and dashes to the bedroom but before she can barricade the door, Truman forces his way inside. They both tumble onto the waterbed causing it to rock back and forth. Gripping Meryl's hair, Truman throws aside the bed covers.
TRUMAN
(distraught, referring to the bed)
How could you buy this damn thing when you know he drowned in front of me?!
Truman raises the kitchen knife but instead of stabbing Meryl begins to slash viciously at the waterbed, opening a large gash.
TRUMAN
You have any idea what it's like to drown?
Truman drops the knife and forces Meryl's head into the gaping hole in the bed, submerging her head in the tepid water. She thrashes her arms wildly trying to free herself.
Truman reluctantly jerks her head back out of the water.
MERYL
(gasping for air)
Truman, stop it!
(to the ceiling)
Don't let him do it!
TRUMAN
(to a light fixture, threatening)
I'll kill her!
He dunks her head into the water a second time, holding her head down longer this time. She continues to struggle.
Suddenly, the front door chimes. Startled, Truman lets Meryl up for air.
TRUMAN
(sneering at Meryl)
Right on time.	Cops must be telepathic.
Meryl spots the kitchen knife within her reach but Truman beats her to it. Grabbing the knife by the blade, he slices his hand.
TRUMAN
(wincing in pain)
Damn!
At knifepoint, Truman marches Meryl down the hallway to the front door. The doorbell chimes a second and third time, more insistently.
TRUMAN
(shouting through the closed door)
Stay where you are or I'll kill her!
MARLON (O.C.)
Truman?	It's me, Marlon.
Truman flinches. He was so convinced it would be the police. He takes a step back against the hallway wall. Before he can decide what to do, Marlon has opened the unlocked front door to be confronted with the sight of Truman holding the knife to Meryl's throat, blood streaming from his own wound.
Marlon locks eyes on Truman. Sizing up the situation, he slowly but decisively removes the knife from Truman's hand. Meryl wrenches herself free from Truman's now limp grasp, and collapses into Marlon's arms, sobbing.
MERYL
(distraught, dropping character,
forgetting herself)
They were going to let him kill me!
EXT.	ABANDONED FREEWAY.	NIGHT.
MARLON and TRUMAN, both nursing bottles of beer, sit on the end of their abandoned freeway off-ramp.
TRUMAN
People know who I am, my every move, complete strangers know my name. Even when there's no one around, I feel the eyes on me.
MARLON
(reluctant admission)
I was in the bank today. The Federal on Lewis. A clerk was talking about somebody named Truman messing with her baby. Is that the stranger you're talking about?
Truman closes his eyes as he takes in the explanation.
TRUMAN
(half to himself, refusing	to accept it)
No.	No.  I've	never seen her before.
(registering Marlon's skepticism)
I know you already think I'm going	out
of my	mind but	I genuinely believe	the
world	revolves	around me somehow.	Everybody
seems	to be in	on it.
MARLON
It's a lot of world for one man.	You sure
that's not wishful thinking, you wishing
you'd made something more of yourself?	Christ,
Truman, who hasn't sat on the John and had an imaginary interview with Barbara Walters? Who hasn't wanted to be somebody?
TRUMAN
That's just it.	I think I am somebody.
MARLON
(sympathetizing)
I used to dream all my friends and family got together in a hotel room, thinking of ways to fuck me up.
TRUMAN
Sometimes I think it's in my head, sometimes
I think it's for real.
Marlon looks around as if drawing inspiration from somewhere in the night.
MARLON
Tru, we've known each other since before we could get a hard-on.
Truman half-smiles at the ribald remark.
MARLON
The only way we ever made it through
high school was cheating off each other's test papers. Jesus, they were identical. I always liked that, because whatever the answer was, we was right together and we was wrong together.
Truman nods fondly at the memory.
MARLON
The only night either of us ever spent in jail, we spent together and I wet myself but you never told anyone.
I was best man at your wedding and my brother was best man at my wedding and you didn't talk to me for a month over that and I didn't blame you because you've been more of a brother to me than he's ever been. And I never shoulda let my Goddam father talk me into that.
Truman is slowly coming around. Marlon's speech from the heart soothing away his pain.
MARLON
I know things haven't worked out for either of us like we used to sit up on Freemont Street all night and dream they would. We all let opportunities pass us by, none of us asks for the dance as often as we should. I know that feeling when it's like everything's slipping away and you don't want to believe it so you look for answers someplace else. But, well, the point is, I would gladly step in front of traffic for you.
Truman grins a melancholy grin, nearly all the way back. We see a close up of Marlon's ear. From inside, unheard by Truman, CHRISTOF dictates Marlon's heartfelt speech.
