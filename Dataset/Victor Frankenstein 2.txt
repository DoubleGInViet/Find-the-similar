VICTOR
Before I met you, I was hoping to approach Mr. Barnaby about selling me some of his deceased animals.

IGOR
To what end?	Study?

VICTOR
No.	Not study.
(beat)
I am of the strong belief that
death can be made a temporary
condition.

IGOR
But that’s im-

VICTOR
Improbable, yes, impossible, don’t be stupid. Very little is actually impossible. Life is temporary, why should death be any different?

IGOR
...What’s under the sheet?
 
34.

VICTOR
...Life, I’ve found, is an energy. The fools would call it a spirit or a soul, but it’s an energy, an identifiable, quantifiable, reproducible energy. I’d spent every hour of my life in pursuit of this energy, and then, last year, a break through. I am a genius, and I created something that will change the world.

IGOR
...Righto.	What’s under the sheet?

Victor yanks away the sheet, revealing a small electrical
generator...And a set of human eyes, a with an interlaced
optical nervous system, suspended in fluid in a fish tank.

IGOR (CONT’D)
Ah-ha.

VICTOR
The eyes are over three months old, and the fluid is electrically conductive jelly. Serves a double function to preserve them, and-well, look, here....

Igor, initially repulsed, goes up and gets a better look as Victor searches through piles of equipment.

IGOR
You’ve done a shoddy job on the
nerves here-

VICTOR
Well, I’m not the surgeon, it’s you with the gifted hands- there!

Victor draws out a gizmo from the pile. It’s about eight inches long, shaped like a wishbone, with wiring running all over it. At the end of each point of the wishbone are two wrought iron bolts.

Victor immediately begins affixing it to wires extending from the electrical generator. For the first time, Victor seems nervous, unsure; a child showing a new friend their favorite toy, hoping they’ll be impressed.

VICTOR (CONT’D)
It’s all a matter of conversion, you see; the conversion of pure electrical energy into biological energy, of the same sort that flows through the bodies of the living. Thus my creation of this device, the Lazarus Fork. You see, by running the electrical current through a specially blended variety of metal and sulfates, I’ve-
 
35.

IGOR
You’ve mastered the conversion.

VICTOR
Well- I- yes.

IGOR
Show me.

VICTOR
I- uh, yes, I shall-

Victor plunges the Lazarus fork into the jelly, and begins turning the crank on the generator; it kicks in, and the electricity begins to flow with a loud rattle and hum.

Igor leans down to the eyes. Victor, excited, goes around and stands next to him.

IGOR
When does it do...something-

VICTOR
It has!	It is!	It- here, look!

Victor draws out a match, and strikes it on the table. The effect is immediate: the eyes turn and focus on the flame. Victor moves it back and forth, and the eyes move to follow.

Victor looks to Igor, nervous.

IGOR
You are a genius. You have created something that will change the world.

VICTOR
This is only the beginning.

INT. VICTOR’S FLAT - MOMENTS LATER

Victor leads Igor out into an open area.

VICTOR
To what degree would you say you understand the function and construction of nerves in the human body?

IGOR
Well I-

VICTOR
No tolerance for the humble here,
Igor.

IGOR
I have a complete mastery of the
nervous and circulatory systems.
(MORE)
 
36.

IGOR (CONT'D)

I am also well versed in the form and structure of the muscles and bones. I also am quite up to date on the deductions made about the function the different parts of the brain serve, although I believe most of the current observations will, in time, prove to be completely wrong.

VICTOR
I- uh- good.	Good!	Perfect.	This
will be your workspace.	I shall
bring you your assignments
piecemeal, and you will complete
them in a timely manner.	I will
then apply your projects to a
larger whole of my own design.
I’ve also decided to allow you to
do my homework assignments for me,
thus enhancing your already
formidable knowledge.	Do you have
any questions?

IGOR
...This larger whole.	What is it?

VICTOR
That is not your concern-

IGOR
But if my work will go towards it, surely I deserve to-

VICTOR
As I said. This was not charity. Your time here will be earned; what you “deserve” is immaterial, agreed?

IGOR
(after a beat)
...Agreed.	I want to help change
the world.

Victor smiles, and extends his hand, which Igor tentatively shakes.

WE MOVE INTO A
MONTAGE AS TIME
PASSES...

Intercutting between two threads...

1.	Turpin’s intensifying search for the Hunchback. The wanted posters are getting old and worn, new ones are being plastered up, the reward for information doubling...

And
 
37.

2.	Igor’s work. We watch as time and time again Victor brings him moist newly dead flesh (much of it of unidentifiable nature), along with supplies and diagrams of what he wants done. Igor masterfully stitches together skin and tissue, creates artificial nerves and veins with electric wiring and thin rubber tubes...

It’s all very gross, but Igor, looking through goggles, magnifying glasses and microscopes, is so into it we can’t help but share his enthusiasm.

After each assignment, Victor demonstrates his emphatic approval, before retreating to the basement with the “finished product” (lungs that breath, muscles that twitch, nerves that react) each time slamming the door.

SLAM SLAM SLAM SLAM...


INT. VICTOR’S FLAT

Igor is sitting and drawing; a sketch of Lorelei, floating through the air between two trapeze. The electric lights in the room flicker for a moment, and Igor looks up.

There’s a noise at the door, and we see an envelope pushed through the slot. Igor looks around, then hesitantly goes and picks it up. It’s marked: I.STRAUSSMAN - URGENT.

Igor moves to set the I.STRAUSSMAN letter on a pile by the door of other mail for Victor’s absent roommate, but then falters. He hesitates, and listens for Victor; nothing.

Igor opens the envelope, and scans through the letter inside:
PAYMENT 2 MONTHS OVERDUE.	FINAL NOTICE.

The door to the basement bursts open, startling Igor.

IGOR
This letter for Master Straussman, it-

Victor is positively glowing with happiness.

VICTOR
We’re going out on the town.

EXT. LONDON - THE WEST END - NIGHT

Victor and Igor head up the street, talking.

VICTOR
I have a tenured membership in the club through my father. He was a charter member, helped to buy the velvet for the seats.

IGOR
You make your father out to be a
great man.
 
38.

VICTOR
Esteemed doctor, member of the
royal corps of physicians, he’s a
innovator, he’s brilliant.

IGOR
Do you think I’ll ever get to meet him?

VICTOR
Oh I don’t- I- I don’t know, he’s a very busy man, and he- his schedule, you know.

IGOR
You mentioned he had a library?

VICTOR
The biggest personal collection of medical texts in Britain, yes, you could say he has a library-

IGOR
Do you think he has a copy of
Thompson’s?

VICTOR
Thompson’s Anatomy?	Well, it’s
rare but, I mean, of course-

IGOR
Do you think we could go there, to his library?

VICTOR
What’s this fixation on Thompson’s?

IGOR
In the circus, I had a copy.	It
was a great inspiration to me.

VICTOR
Well, I- you know, he doesn’t let
me- give me access, I’m just a
young man- he’d be so angry if he
found out I’d been touching his
books- oh, look, here we are!

They’ve come up on THE EXETER, an extremely fancy (and hip, and fun, and crowded) looking club.

IGOR
Oh...Master Victor, I don’t know if
I’m suited for all this-
 
39.

VICTOR
Pishposh. All you need to do is keep your back straight, your words clean, and try your damndest not to embarrass me.

SMASH CUT TO:

VICTOR (CONT’D)
BABIES GROWN IN VATS.

INT. THE EXETER - CONTINUOUS

Victor is WASTED, sitting in a corner booth with Igor and a few girls. The club is awesome, and packed; the girls are pretty damn hot, too, but they’re mostly focused on Igor, who himself is trying not to notice, instead focusing on Victor.

IGOR
(laughing)

Victor why does this idea fascinate you?

VICTOR
I’m just saying the act- of
FERTILIZATION- can take place out
side of the woman’s body.	The
sperm, the sperm can move-
(hiccup)
The sperms can move into the egg,
say, in a saucer, some sort of
heated basin-

SEXY SOCIETY GIRL
And where does the mother figure
into this, then?

VICTOR
Well, you’d- after you impregnate the egg, you get a funnel- and then you...you know- into the woman-

SEXY SOCIETY REDHEAD
Oh, that’s just wretched.

VICTOR
IT’S THE FUTURE! Igor, tell them, assist me in this, this valuable endeavor.

Igor doesn’t respond; he’s staring across the club to the bar...

...Where Lorelei stands. She looks stunning. Gone is all the muck and grime of the circus, though she still wears a sling over her injured arm.

IGOR
Ladiesyoullhavetoexcuseme
 
40.

Both women groan in disappointment but Igor is already up and gone, clumsily pushing his way through the club. He gets to the bar; she’s gone! No, there she is, headed up the stairs-

INT. THE EXETER - UPPER LEVEL - CONTINUOUS

Igor catches up to Lorelei at the top of the stairs; she turns, sensing his presence before he can say anything. They stand there deadlocked in silence, staring at each other.

She suddenly embraces him; Igor is shocked. She whispers into his ear, her words fraught with emotion.

LORELEI
You saved my life.	You saved my
life.

Igor let’s out a sigh of complete relief.

LATER...

Igor and Lorelei are hanging out, leaning on one of the balconies over the club; they’re completely relaxed, talking like old friends, or, more accurately, refugees.

IGOR
Penham Mall? That’s really fancy, though, isn’t it?

LORELEI
Oh, you know, just the richest
section of London.	Haha, I’m
sorry, I’m awful.

IGOR
You can be awful when you look
great, isn’t that the way people
behave?

LORELEI
High praise from a bloke who’s
twice the man he used to be, in
height alone.

IGOR
Well, I, uh- I don’t really- um- So does he intend to marry you?

LORELEI
Who, Baron Bomine?	I think you
misunderstand our relationship-

IGOR
Do I?

LORELEI
Oh, and now I see a glint of hope
in your eye.
 
41.

IGOR
Oh no, I just- um- listening-

LORELEI
I met him in the hospital; he was in with a twisted ankle of all things, and he just swept me away once he’d heard the circus left without me. At first he did come on awfully romantic, but- honestly I’ve come to believe that he’s taken me in as his consort more for appearances than anything else.

IGOR
Appearances?

Lorelei nods down at BARON BOMINE, who’s on the main floor.
He’s the gayest man alive.

IGOR (CONT’D)
Aaaah.	Oh.
 

IGOR (CONT’D)
Robert the Juggler.
 


LORELEI
Robert the Juggler.

 
Both of them immediately crack up.

LORELEI
I don’t know why you’re laughing.
I think it’s very important for a
juggler to have a sincere love of
balls-

Both of them crack up again, and then there’s a ruckus from downstairs; Igor looks and sees that Victor’s accidentally knocked some plates on the floor whilst animatedly gesturing.

LORELEI (CONT’D)
Isn’t that your chap there?

IGOR
Yes, Victor Frankenstein. Smartest person I’ve ever met. He’s the one who helped me save you, as well.

He got me out of the circus, fixed my back...I owe him everything.

VICTOR
Have you ever seen a human brain?
It’s...GRAY!

IGOR
(faltering)

He’s quite brilliant, really, just not so much of a...person for talking to people.

VICTOR
(audible over the crowd)
I’ve seen a rat nest in a brain!
 
42.

Igor looks to Lorelei, trying to hold back a laugh. She doesn’t do as well holding back. The ruckus downstairs continues; Victor’s pissed off some jerk.

IGOR
Ah, it looks like he may need my-

LORELEI
But of course.

Igor starts to go, but then stops.

IGOR
Listen, we’re right in the West
End, on Verner Street.

LORELEI
Forty Five Penham Lane.

IGOR
So we’ll see each other again.

LORELEI
Yes.	Definitely.

IGOR
My name is Igor.

VICTOR (O.S.)
YOU ARE A BEASTLY, BEASTLY MAN

There’s a crash downstairs. Igor turns and rushes off, leaving Lorelei in a very pleasant state of shock.

LORELEI
“Igor.”

EXT. LONDON - ALLEY

Victor is puking into a pile of garbage, while Igor stands next to him, patting his back.

VICTOR
People are such animals, you know...I don’t understand them, I admit this, to some degree. I don’t know the things to say to make them like me, or- not like me, I don’t care if they like me-

IGOR
It’s all right.

VICTOR
What?

IGOR
It’s all right to care if people
like you.	I like you.
 
43.

VICTOR
I...like you, as well.	Yes.
(beat, straightens up)
Igor, tonight was not meaningless
frivolity.	It is a celebration.

IGOR
...What are we celebrating?

INT. VICTOR’S FLAT - THE BASEMENT

The electric lights flicker and hum to life, illuminating the most sinister, fascinating place you’ve ever seen. The walls are covered in makeshift electrical equipment, some of it very clearly decades, maybe even centuries ahead of its time.

Mixed in with this are all manner of medical instruments and tools, as well as charts of human and animal anatomy. Perhaps most creepy of all is the fact that large portions of the room are covered in red-brown stains.

Blood.

Victor comes rushing down the stairs, nearly falling.

VICTOR
Come on, come on!

Igor hesitates at the top of the stairs, then slowly comes down. Victor, meanwhile, primes a bunch of electrical generators...all hooked into something on a table, under a sheet, in the center of the room.

IGOR
What is that?

VICTOR
Under this bedsheet is the product of ten years study, laborious hours spent over books and tinkering with electrical machines-

Igor approaches the table and Victor rips off the sheet...

VICTOR (CONT’D)
I present to you: Gordon!

The...thing...called Gordon most closely resembles a chimpanzee, but a glance shows it to be something else entirely.

This is a patchwork monster, cobbled and stitched together from mostly chimp flesh, but with parts that are definitely cheetah, as well as other unidentifiable bits and pieces. A lot of it appears sloppy; electrical wiring and tubes are visible all over the body, and the whole thing looks ready to fall apart.

As Igor tries to process, Victor goes back to the machines.
 
44.

IGOR
You...you made this-

VICTOR
No.	We made this.

Igor’s eyes go over the creature, pinpointing all of his work; it’s all gone to this monstrosity. Victor primes machines, and they begin to hum and whir loudly.

VICTOR (CONT’D)
The lungs, the spine, the heart, the brain, all your work. All impossible without you, as a matter of fact. Are you ready?

Igor is clearly horrified; what has he been party to?

IGOR
Victor, I don’t- What is this? You said this was about life, not death-

VICTOR
Stand back.

Victor throws a massive switch, and there’s a sharp buzz of electricity! We see arcs and loops of blue energy zap across suspended cables, slamming into connectors on the bolts in Gordon’s neck.

Igor leaps back, startled.	Steam rises off Gordon’s body.
The machines wind down.	Victor approaches slowly.

IGOR
...What-

VICTOR
Look.	Listen.

Igor looks and listens...and is amazed. Gordon is alive. Only marginally, but yes...the chest rises and falls. The eyes, horrible and monstrous, are open, and blinking.

Igor’s shock and excitement is palpable. He runs his hands over its flesh and puts his ear to its chest, listening to the slow beating of the heart.

He looks down at the animal; there’s an odd peace about it, an innocence.

IGOR
It’s...alive.

VICTOR
It’s alive.

IGOR
....Victor-
 
45.

VICTOR
It can’t quite move; the charge only lasts about an hour, and the body is mostly rudimentary mock up-

IGOR
This is- Victor- you’ve created
life from nothing, don’t you see
how impor-

VICTOR
Tomorrow you shall accompany me to the college. I’ve announced that I will be making a presentation of my private studies-

IGOR
I- to the college- as your
assistant?

VICTOR
Assis- Igor, don’t be an idiot.
You’re my partner.

Igor is completely overwhelmed.

SMASH CUT TO:


EXT. THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF MEDICINE - MORNING

The main building of the college is on a big, beautiful campus. Victor and Igor are unloading the big gurney off the top of a coach, the bedsheet tied down tightly.

Victor hands Igor down the heavy dynamo equipment, and Igor looks up at the college. It’s everything he’d ever dreamed.

FLASH TO:

Igor and Victor are rolling the gurney up one of the school’s hallways.

VICTOR
(loudly)

Presentation! Big presentation in hall H!

The school is mostly empty. The students who are there seem at best disinterested, at worst disgusted. Igor notices, but stays quiet.

INT. HALL H

Victor and Igor stand at the front of the big lecture hall. The Gordon-Gurney and the dynamo are all set up. Victor is addressing the audience.
 
46.

Igor is clearly uncomfortable, and concerned about his friend. Victor’s voice has a new element to it: a nervous tremor that we haven’t heard before.

VICTOR
Since the beginning of modern medicine, there has been an assumption regarding the nature of mortality, that being- that being that death is an unavoidable event whose inevitability should be taken for granted. I aim to show that life is not some heavenly grace given to us by an all-powerful god-but no- no instead that it is something natural-

FINNEGAN (O.S.)
Get on with it!

We pan to reveal that the hall is nearly empty; of two hundred seats, only seven are filled. They all look disinterested and bored.

In the back is Michael FINNEGAN, 21, dressed in only the finest clothes, refined, handsome and posh, a child of wealth with an accent so upper-crust he makes Victor and Igor sound like they’re from Michigan.

His outburst draws some laughs from the crowd.

VICTOR
Ah- uh, yes- indeed, I will- Igor,
start up the dynamo.

IGOR
Yes, Master.

VICTOR
I present to you! I present to all of you here, the brave few who came-

FINNEGAN
The brave few, poppycock! It’s the beginning of Christmas recess, of course there’s no one here Frankenstein! I have a coach waiting! Who else is keeping their coach waiting?

There are some murmurs of agreement from the others. Igor primes the dynamo.

VICTOR
I present to you, life by my own
creation!

Victor yanks the bedsheet down. The reveal of Gordon (dead and lifeless) has a definite effect on the crowd: negative; murmurs of disgust, and two students get up and leave.
 
47.

VICTOR (CONT’D)
(hurriedly)

I built this homunculus out of parts primarily taken by from the London Zoo, which has had much difficulty in care of their exotic animals. He is primarily-primarily chimpanzee, but with help from my partner Igor, we have interlaced multiple individuals, multiple species- Igor is it ready, good- If you’ll all come closer, please.

The remaining four students come down, grudgingly, mumbling.
Finnegan stays right where he is.

VICTOR (CONT’D)
And now, through the miracle of
electricity: life!

Igor fires the dynamo. The effect is immediate, and unexpected.

Dozens of flies explode out from all over Gordon! The four students swear and shout their disgust, heading out.

VICTOR (CONT’D)
No no- wait, don’t- Igor, shock him again, harder.

Igor shocks Gordon again. Everyone’s left except Finnegan, who begins applauding.

FINNEGAN
Frankenstein, you have lived up to
your father’s reputation, to your
own expansive mythos of strangeness
and perversion!	Delightful!
Spectacular, just- an exquisite
show of depraved lunacy-

VICTOR
Again, harder!

Igor shocks Gordon again, nothing, and Victor shoves him out

of the way, amps the dynamo all the way, SHOCKS HIM AGAIN...

Nothing.

FINNEGAN
Oh, so the show isn’t over? I must say though, you’ll be hard pressed to beat the flies, a really inspired moment of grotesque revulsion-

Victor shocks Gordon again, STILL NOTHING. The generator sputters and dies, spitting out acrid black smoke.
 
48.

FINNEGAN (CONT’D)
What do you have planned next,
perhaps a midget is hidden inside
your rotting meat sculpture’s
stomach, ready to pop out with a
bouquet of ro-

Gordon groans.

FINNEGAN (CONT’D)
Ro- ...roses...

Gordon...blinks.

VICTOR
Ha!	You see it’s-

Gordon’s right arm RIPS FREE OF THE RESTRAINTS, SMASHING VICTOR AND SENDING HIM FLAILING BACKWARDS INTO A BLACKBOARD, WHICH CRACKS IN HALF ON HIS IMPACT.

IGOR
VIC-

The other arm tears loose, grabs Igor and flings him into the generator. He collapses, dazed.

Oh shit.

Finnegan stands, watching as Gordon finishes ripping itself free from the gurney.

FINNEGAN
I	say.

Finnegan, fearless with the entitled bravado of the truly wealthy, rushes down to Gordon as it gets up.

Gordon turns on him, leaping up onto the podium ahead of him and blocking his path-

He stands perfectly still. Gordon ROARS, an unnatural, painful sound, and Finnegan falls on his ass, before the creature turns and gracefully springboards off the wall, crashing out through a window to the roof.

FINNEGAN (CONT’D)
By jove.	Brilliant.

Igor, frantic, races to the shattered window, looking out after Gordon, then goes to Victor, who’s groggily getting up.

IGOR
The creature-

VICTOR
Did you see?	Incredible!

Victor can’t stand, he’s too woozy from the hit.
 
49.

VICTOR (CONT’D)
Better than I possibly could have
hoped for-

IGOR
But it’s free!	It’s- dangerous!

VICTOR
Yes, marvellous-

IGOR
Victor, we have to stop it-

Igor turns and Victor grabs him roughly by the sleeve.

VICTOR
No. You mustn’t let any harm come to it. It’s my creation, it’s more important than any the lives of any of the idiots at this school.

There’s a moment of very intense eye contact, and then Igor yanks his arm away, and Victor falls.

VICTOR (CONT’D)
Damn it Igor!

Igor rushes out onto the roof.

AND WE FOLLOW
HIM

Out onto the perilous, sloping shingled tiles of the school’s roof. Gordon, a creature never meant for full mobility, has started leaking. Badly.

He’s left a trail of blood that Igor hurries to follow, nearly slipping a few times on the tiles turning a corner and finding Gordon perched on a chimney, looking down at a courtyard full of students with their bags, waiting to go home for winter break.

It has a bloodlust in its eyes, the crazed violence of an insane animal never meant to exist; it starts to head down towards the courtyard, growling...

Igor, having the epiphany that he has no idea how to stop this thing, skids to a halt in the soot of the chimney.

IGOR
H-...Hello, I-

Gordon turns abruptly, and SCREAMS, charging down the roof, ripping up roof tiles and flinging them at Igor, who turns, scrambling away, but Gordon quickly overtakes him, tackling him and sending them both tumbling violently down towards the ledge.

The fall has a bizarre, unsettling effect on Gordon; the creature’s patchwork body, not intended for this, has started to come apart!
 
50.

Igor and Gordon fall over the edge, but Igor catches himself, dangling by one hand over a fifteen foot drop to the roof of the school’s greenhouse.

Gordon COMES OUT OF NOWHERE, swinging at him easily and gracefully, SLASHING WILDLY. The blows knock Igor’s grip loose, and tear his shirt, exposing the backbrace beneath; dangling this way Igor is defenseless, and he has to take the hits as they come, until-

GORDON LEAPS ENTIRELY ONTO IGOR, causing them both to plummet down onto

THE GREENHOUSE

-shattering a large portion of it. Igor is left laying dazed across the rickety framework. He slowly pushes himself to his feet, forced to go back to his circus training; on these thin steel beams, it’s practically a tightrope.

All right......	IGOR (CONT’D)	
	where’d you	
go...where’d you-

Gordon BURSTS UP THROUGH A PANEL TO HIS RIGHT, taking a wild swing, and Igor is forced to hurry his treacherous progress, trying to make it to a nearby roof. Meanwhile, Gordon is easily monkeying around upside-down on the interior ceiling of the greenhouse, smashing through panels to take wild swings at Igor.

Igor makes the leap to the roof, and Gordon comes smashing into him from behind; the impact is enough to literally knock one of Igor’s shoes off, but his training as a clown helps him to roll with the impact.

Gordon roars again, and charges once more; a chase begins over the roof of the college, which we the audience along with Igor realize is actually many buildings, built only a few feet apart.

Igor, jumping these gaps with this monstrosity mere seconds behind him and gaining, realizes what he has to do.

Jumping past a wind-vein, Igor rips it free, and at the next gap, TURNS AND BASHES GORDON ACROSS THE FACE.

Gordon is disoriented mid-jump, and begins to fall into the gap between the buildings, BUT GRABS IGOR, PULLING HIM DOWN TOO-

BETWEEN THE
BUILDINGS

The space is incredibly claustrophobic, their fall slowed by impacts against both walls- For a terrifying moment Igor is trapped against the monster’s bosom, but he fights free-
 
51.

Bracing himself against the walls, Igor tries to make it to the edge as the still-falling monster grabs at him- again Igor braces himself but his knees are at his chest, and the monster pulls him down further, it finally hitting the ground-

Igor tries to move over it; it hits him, HARD, dazing him but pushing him to the edge- Gordon yanks itself towards him, not caring about the flesh being sheared away, he’s doomed, it-

The dazed Igor is yanked out

INTO A PATCH OF
DIRT BY THE
STABLES

Igor lays there dazed, watching helplessly as Gordon begins to pull itself free, snarling and roaring in rage, one arm grabbing Igor’s leg-

WHAM. A shovel comes down Gordon’s wrist, and he jerks back his arm, taking a swing instead at

VICTOR FRANKENSTEIN, wielding a shovel. Again we see the easy, serpentine way Victor can dodge; he ghosts around three huge swings from the monster’s free arm, and then brings the shovel crashing down on its head-

-and again-

-and again and again and again AND AGAIN AND AGAIN-

IGOR (CONT’D)
Victor!	It’s dead, it’s dead!

Victor, covered in the creature’s blood, his hair hanging in sweaty strands, hunched over and breathing hard, looks at Igor. He drops the shovel.

IGOR (CONT’D)
You killed it.	You...you killed it-

VICTOR
Of course.
(beat)
I couldn’t let it hurt you, could
I?

Igor and Victor stare at each other, realizing with equal parts fear and enthusiasm how little each of them knows about the true nature of the other.

FINNEGAN
Clean that damn thing up.

Finnegan runs up, possibly the most exercise he’s ever had, followed by his huge, fancy coach.
 
52.

FINNEGAN (CONT’D) I’ve had my men collect your equipment from the hall, now clean that thing up and get it into the carriage, quick.

VICTOR
What?	Why?

FINNEGAN
Just do it!

Victor stares at him, looking completely insane, and Finnegan is correctly intimidated.

FINNEGAN (CONT’D) Because you’re two mad bloody geniuses, and it would be a tremendous waste to see you hauled off to Scotland Yard.

Victor looks to Igor. Igor looks to Victor. Victor offers Igor his hand, and Igor takes it.

Victor pulls him to his feet.

CLOSE ON:

Fingers, fidgeting with a crucifix, turning it around and around, end over end.

INT. GREENHOUSE - SUNSET

Inspector Turpin is here with Alistair, amongst all the broken glass, as they talk to an elderly GROUNDSKEEPER.

Turpin’s red-eyed, anemic condition appears slightly worse; he’s distracted, not really paying attention to the Groundskeeper, instead looking up at the shattered roof, osmosing the scene, fidgeting with his cross.

GROUNDSKEEPER
We didn’t expect to have a real Inspector from the yard out, you see, we just thought there would be a few bobbies to make a report of the damages.

ALISTAIR
Inspector Turpin and I are here
because he believes- we believe
there might be a connection to an
ongoing investigation.

Turpin notices something on the wall, and gets up onto a table, trying to get a better look at the roof. He reaches up and touches something on the shattered window.
 
53.

GROUNDSKEEPER
Oh, I nary think it’s anything so
serious, probably just some
hooligans out for a laugh before
christma-

Turpin raises his hand, which is covered in blood.

TURPIN
Hooligans.

GROUNDSKEEPER
Good christ-

TURPIN
Constable, give me a lift would
you?

MOMENTS LATER,
ON THE ROOF...

Turpin has pulled himself up out onto the shattered roof, Constable Alistair clumsily following. Turpin begins making his way further up the roof.

ALISTAIR
Inspector, I don’t think it’s safe that we should-

TURPIN
Oh come now, I’m making easy work of it, and I haven’t slept in days.

ALISTAIR
...You haven’t been sleeping?

TURPIN
A slip of the tongue. It’s just been a difficult time. Not enough money in this job; a christly occupation, to be certain, but I can’t afford a sitter to watch my Rebecca, and it’s...taxing, on the mind. I’ve been having nightmares, as well.

ALISTAIR
Well, the case has gone mostly cold. Sir, if you need a break, I’m sure myself or Inspector Walton could take over-

Turpin hoists himself up onto the next level of the roof, noticing Igor’s shoe and picking it up as he goes.

TURPIN
Don’t be silly, Ali; what do you think the nightmares are...about...

ALISTAIR
Inspector?	Something wrong?
 
54.

Alistair hurriedly pulls himself up onto the roof after Turpin, and sees Turpin, still clutching the shoe, staring at the glaringly obvious trail of blood and destruction, bizarre and horrifying in the darkening daylight.

ALISTAIR (CONT’D)
Dear god.

TURPIN
...Mostly cold indeed.

INT. VICTOR’S FLAT

Victor and Igor are arguing; it’s the first time this has ever happened.

IGOR
It was bloody homicidal!

VICTOR
There was no way I could’ve known-

IGOR
But Victor you could’ve helped, you could’ve done something-

VICTOR
I did do something, I saved your life! What was I meant to do, spring up like a jack-in-the-box after it pummeled me into a wall, say how-ya-do and take it down with a crisp uppercut? What did you want-

IGOR
You said you didn’t care about the people at the school! The other students-

VICTOR
Stop going on about “people” being “in danger” and you being “thrown off a building,” Igor, we made real progress today!

Finnegan emerges from the attic door. Igor starts a rebuttal, but Victor raises a hand, and Igor’s subservient instincts guide him to silence. They look to Finnegan.

FINNEGAN
Am I to understand you...built all that?

VICTOR
That’s correct.
 
55.

FINNEGAN
And you...Mr. Straussman, you were responsible for conglomerating the organic tissue of the creature I saw today?

IGOR
I-
(looks to Victor)
Yes, that’s right.

Finnegan’s next words are measured to the millimeter.

FINNEGAN
I...apologize, Victor.	I
had...misjudged you. Your flaws, though they are glaring and massive are...merely social, not intellectual. I find your work astonishing, innovative, and...to be perfectly frank...brilliant beyond my own ability to comprehend.

There’s a beat, and Finnegan takes a deep breath.

FINNEGAN (CONT’D)
As you know, I come from the third richest family in England. Could you create another one, like Gordon?

IGOR
Like Gordon?

FINNEGAN
Well, no.	A man.	Something
capable of following orders.

IGOR
No, that’s ridicu-

VICTOR
We’ll do it.	We can do it.

FINNEGAN
Is there a hesitation, Igor?

IGOR
This technology is not meant for-

VICTOR
There is no hesitation.

Finnegan gives Igor a short glance, chuckling.

FINNEGAN
I have the means to back you in
your experiments on much larger
scale.
(MORE)
 
56.

FINNEGAN (CONT'D)

All of them, Igor, this artificial man would just be a starting point. You’re certain you’re-

VICTOR
He’s certain.

FINNEGAN
Hah, very well. I’ll want another demonstration, more controlled. I want to know that you can follow direction. Take orders, so to speak. Is this a problem?

VICTOR
No.

FINNEGAN
Excellent. Expect to hear from me soon.

Finnegan leaves, and Igor stares angrily at Victor. Victor turns on him abruptly, and before Igor can speak he’s immediately caught in a paralyzingly crisp stream of words.

VICTOR
You did not create this technology, yet you presume to tell me how to use it? Know your place. I will not let your own ignorance of the world at large stand in the way of the progress of my experiments.

IGOR
But Victor, surely-

VICTOR
Have you already forgotten what I
did for you at the circus?

Igor falls silent.

VICTOR (CONT’D)
This is my destiny, this is your destiny, Finnegan is our only ally and we will build him a whole damn zoo of homunculi if it means furthering our research, am I understood?

IGOR
...Yes Mast- Yes Victor.

INT. VICTOR’S FLAT - BASEMENT LAB

Igor slowly comes down the stairs. Victor, wearing a lab-coat, is working in near total darkness, lit by sparks.
 
57.

He’s standing over the operating table, which has a new sheet over it; something under the sheet writhes and twists bizarrely.

VICTOR
So glad you could be here. I want to show you my newest creation.

Igor moves forward; there’s strange, muted growling from beneath the sheet. Igor looks to Victor, who grabs the sheet and yanks it off, revealing...

The Hunchback, dirty in his tattered clown uniform, writhing in his restraints on the table!

The Hunchback turns to Igor and let’s out Gordon’s hideous, mechanical scream!

SMASH TO:


INT. VICTOR’S FLAT - IGOR’S ROOM

Igor snaps awake in bed, breathing hard. He calms himself down, and then looks out the window, at dawn over London.

EXT. BARON BOMINE’S RESIDENCE - MORNING

The huge house is beautiful, led into by a long driveway. Igor stands at the edge of this drive, clearly nervous, fidgeting. A butler comes walking up the drive to get the mail, and Igor, frantic, jumps into a bush to try to hide.

The butler reaches the end of the drive, picks up the mail, and then casually turns to Igor in the bush.

BUTLER
Can I help you, sir?

IGOR
I...uh...I’m here to see Lorelei.

BUTLER
Master Igor, I presume.

Igor falters, surprised, and then smiles.


EXT. THE THAMES - RIVERSIDE

Igor and Lorelei, looking positively scorching hot, walk together up a walkway on the side of the Thames.

LORELEI
Well why don’t you just tell him
you won’t do it?

VICTOR
It’s not- I owe him everything, I
can’t just-
 
58.

LORELEI
Why not?	You said he identifies
you as his partner.

IGOR
(quietly)
Yes...

LORELEI
I don’t know, if you ask me the
whole business sounds sinister.
Cutting up corpses?	Bringing
people back from the grave?	I’m
not a scientist nor a priest, but
doesn’t it seem wrong to you?
Against nature?

IGOR
No, no...It’s about life, not
death.

Igor and Lorelei are coming up a bridge to cross it, and Igor realizes privately that it’s the same bridge he jumped off in his circus escape. They stop, looking out over the dyes.

IGOR (CONT’D)
Victor dreams of a world filled with hope, instead of fear. A world where a mother who dies during childbirth can live to see her son, where a murdered man can personally identify his murderer. Where a paralyzed soldier with shrapnel embedded in his spine can be killed, healed, and then be brought back to life to walk again. The possibilities are endless...

LORELEI
Yes but Igor...what do you want?
What is your place in this dream?

IGOR
...Enough about me.	What’s next
for you?

Lorelei gives him a look, but then laughs.

LORELEI
Honestly?	I was thinking of
starting to give lessons...maybe
even starting a school.

IGOR
Trapeze?

LORELEI
No, very few high society girls
enjoy...trapeze, more dance.
(MORE)
 
59.

LORELEI (CONT'D)

Gymnastics and dance, all the things I know best- I could never go back to a circus, to that life-

Lorelei stops, seeming to gather herself.

LORELEI (CONT’D)
I must- I must- you were my closest friend, for three years I knew you as “the hunchback-”

IGOR
That’s over now-

LORELEI
But the things I saw and- Igor can you ever forgive me, I’m so sorry-

IGOR
You shouldn’t apologize-

LORELEI
No, I should.	I should I should
(is overcome)
I saw the way they treated you,
sleeping in that rail car and-

IGOR
Lorelei-

LORELEI
The beatings, you’d come around covered in bruises, I did nothing oh I did nothing, because I was too afraid and, and selfish-

IGOR
Lorelei it’s all right-

LORELEI
But that’s your nature to say “it’s all right,” you’re too forgiving-

IGOR
What were you going to do? Take it up with management? Who was there to tell? Who was there to turn to? If you’d come to my aid Nathaniel, Rafferty and the rest...I never blamed you. Not once. Ever.

Igor let’s this sink in. They look down over bridge, to where the dyes are pouring into the water, coloring it purple, blue, red, green...

IGOR (CONT’D)
Besides, we’re here now, aren’t we?
We’re here and we’re beautiful.
 
60.

LORELEI
(collecting herself)
What I’m saying is you mustn’t
allow anyone to bully you, ever
again.	If you think Victor is on
the wrong road, you must make a
stand.	Don’t let yourself be
anyone’s footstool, ever again.
Promise me.

Igor blinks; he’s somewhat in shock.

IGOR
I...I promise.

There’s a beat.	They’re staring into each other’s eyes.
There should be a kiss here.	There isn’t.

EXT. VICTOR’S FLAT - SHORTLY THEREAFTER

Igor is confidently approaching the door; he reaches out to open it, but then takes a beat.

IGOR
(mutter under his breath)
Victor...truly respect me as a
scientist...something you can’t
control...

Someone loudly clears their throat behind him, startling Igor into a little yelp.

There stands Doctor Claus Von FRANKENSTEIN, late 50s early 60s, lean and gray, with a demeanor so cold his breath has a wind chill factor.

FRANKENSTEIN
Igor. You look...slimmer. I see you’ve finally organized your hair.
(beat)

You know your parents are worried sick about you, I assume. Tina has been in regular correspondence.

IGOR
...I’m sorry, I don’t-

FRANKENSTEIN
Is Victor here.

IGOR
Yes, I-

FRANKENSTEIN
Very well.
