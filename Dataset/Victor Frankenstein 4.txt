FINNEGAN
All right, time is of the essence.
Gentlemen, your coach is ready-

IGOR
No Victor I see clearly. You are blind, and you have no capacity to see what’s happened, what you’ve done-

FINNEGAN
-also, if I could ask you to turn
down the volume, my parents are
home after all-

Victor looks from Finnegan, to Igor and back.

IGOR
You can go to your ruin.	But I’m
staying here.

VICTOR
Oh? And going where, exactly? Back to the Blue Meringue to resume your illustrious-

IGOR
It’s none of your concern.

VICTOR
None of my- Oh, just brilliant! What? To Lorelei? Where will you go?

Igor is silent, staring at Victor; Victor can feel himself being judged, slowly realizing that Igor is completely out of his control. His expression changes.

VICTOR (CONT’D)
You fool. I created you. Clown! Circus freak! You think because I put you in a back-brace and cut your hair you can turn your back on me, go ahead, see how far you get in the real world with your “acrobat” and your new life! You stand in the way of the future, you’re an embarrassment to everything I’d hoped to accomplish! Fine! Fine! I’m rid of you, rid of you, rid of you!

Victor stands there, breathing hard, waiting for Igor to respond. He doesn’t. Victor fidgets, seeming about to speak again, then turns and storms out.

Igor looks after him in shocked disappointment.

MOMENTS LATER...
 
91.

Igor stands on the balcony, watching Victor below as he gets into a coach, stolid, emotionless. Finnegan appears next to him, and looks down at the departing coach, then at Igor.

He smiles.

FINNEGAN
So what’s next for you, then?

IGOR
...I don’t know.

FINNEGAN
That’s sad to hear, old boy. Sad to hear. Seems you and Victor have had a bit of a falling out.

IGOR
I said what I meant to say.

FINNEGAN
Very well, very well, good for you.
(beat)
You know, I knew Igor Straussman.

Igor blinks.

FINNEGAN (CONT’D)
A real bore, nouveau riche, drug
addict.	Nothing like...this.

IGOR
I-

FINNEGAN
Ah-ah-ah.	So who are you then?
That’s the question.	Doesn’t
matter, really.	Victor’s been very
forthcoming with his designs, but I
still need him for now.	You, on
the other hand-

IGOR
Finnegan-

FINNEGAN
So let’s see: your benefactor has departed, your home has been ransacked by police, your identity revealed as a fraud...Do you understand what I’m saying?
(beat)
What I’m getting at, old sport, is that you won’t be missed.

Igor is jabbed in the neck with a syringe, and one of Finnegan’s goons YANKS A BURLAP SACK OVER IGOR’S HEAD FROM BEHIND.

SMASH TO BLACK.
 
92.

We can hear the sounds of a carriage rattling up the street; we’re in Igor’s POV. Finnegan speaks; Igor’s drugged, and through the burlap sack Finnegan’s face distorts in nightmarish ways.

FINNEGAN (O.C) (CONT’D) You know you and Victor aren’t the only ones with vision. You aren’t the only ones trying to change the world. I too have a dream of the future. A dream where the British empire extends not just to India and Africa, but over the entire globe. A world where dead enemy soldiers are reassembled into new British troops. I see an unkillable army of your monsters, one million strong, marching across Paris, Moscow, Washington DC...
(beat)
Oh, you don’t approve.	I’d
imagined you and Victor wouldn’t
like that much.	Luckily, the
architects won’t have to live in
the house they built.	Goodbye
“Igor.”

There’s the sound of a door opening.

SMASH TO:

A watery impact - SPLASH!

Igor, the bag over his head, his ankles bound together and his hands tied behind his back, rapidly sinks down into the water. He struggles frantically, but can’t get free.

Igor’s nearly at the bottom now; it’s getting dark. He manages to shake off the bag, but still can’t get his hands free of the binds.

He’s running out of air; he stares up at the light coming down through the water high above him.

He’s out of time.

Igor bends violently forward, cracking his back! He SCREAMS in pain, but the new position allows him to slip his hands under his feet, which lets him rip off the bindings around his ankles.

EXT. THE THAMES - SHORE - CONTINUOUS

Igor, returned to his hunchbacked state, drags himself up through the mud onto the shore of the Thames. He vomits out water, coughing, and howls in pain, tearing off his wrist bindings and clutching his back.

He looks up noticing a group of little boys who were playing by the river.
 
93.

IGOR
Help...Help me-

The little boys, horrified of this muddy river monster, turn and run. Igor lays there, sobbing and coughing.

EXT. BARON BOMINE’S RESIDENCE - LATER

Lorelei is sitting at a tea table in the gardens, sipping tea and reading a book. There’s a crash from nearby, and Lorelei stands up, going around the side of the house, where she sees...

Igor, filthy and pathetic, the hunchback, cowering behind some garbage bins. He stares up at her, helpless and ashamed.

She goes to him.

FADE TO BLACK.

FADE IN...

It’s been at least a week. Igor, worn out, is in a bed, sick....He tries to get up, but then collapses onto the ground; Lorelei rushes to help him.

IGOR
Victor...Victor...

Igor passes out.

FADE TO BLACK.

ABRUPT CUT TO:

A crucifix, dangling limply. There’s a scratching sound in the background.

INT. SCOTLAND YARD - CHIEF INSPECTOR’S OFFICE

Roderick Turpin sits alone in the police chief’s officer at the desk. He’s grinding the heavy brass hook that used to be his right hand back and forth on the arm of his chair.

Time has past, and his injuries are healing: his left eye is gone, covered by a leather patch. His skin is pock-marked with electrical burns, still covered by bandages.

He is staring straight ahead at the chief’s empty seat. He doesn’t move at all, except for the grinding hook.

The CHIEF INSPECTOR enters, flanked by Alistair, who goes and stands by Turpin. The Chief sits. He and Turpin stare at each other.

TURPIN
Straussman wasn’t Straussman.
 
94.

CHIEF INSPECTOR
Beg pardon?

TURPIN
The body, the burning creature, that was Straussman. The young man who said he was Straussman was in fact the hunchback, transformed by Frankenstein-

CHIEF INSPECTOR
Inspector, this is not-

TURPIN
They escaped by way of a Finnegan Family Coach; Finnegan also attends Royal College of Medicine, makes sense, he’s in on it too, maybe funding them-

CHIEF INSPECTOR
Inspector Turpin, stop-

TURPIN
I would guess that Frankenstein has fled the country, more than likely alongside Finnegan, who a little digging showed spends his summers at Castle Erskine in Belgium-

CHIEF INSPECTOR
Roderick-

TURPIN
Which is where we’ll find them, the Hunchback on the other hand- well you see we never found the girl, the aerialist, and I’d wager-

CHIEF INSPECTOR
STOP IT RODDY.	DAMN IT.

TURPIN
Listen.	We can catch them-

CHIEF INSPECTOR
We can.	And we will.

TURPIN
...Am I to understand-

ALISTAIR
You’re being removed from the case.

CHIEF INSPECTOR
The whole force, in fact.
Constable Alistair will be taking
your place.	You are on a medical
and mental reprieve.
 
95.

TURPIN
Don’t do this.	Please.

CHIEF INSPECTOR
Belgium, Roderick?	High society
hunchbacks, undead monsters,
conspiracies involving one of the
richest families in England?
You’ve lost your grip, Roddy,
you’ve lost your whole hand!	Your
eye!	Take a break, please!

TURPIN
You bastard.

CHIEF INSPECTOR
I’m doing this for you. Spend some time with you daughter, rest, good god man. You are the best detective we have, and you haven’t-you haven’t slowed down since Claudia died-

TURPIN
Don’t you mention her name. Don’t you ever say her name.

Turpin seems to think for a moment, then picks up his chair and hurls it into the wall, shattering it. He stands there, uncomfortable, and then looks to Alistair.

TURPIN (CONT’D)
Justice will be done.

Alistair just looks a afraid. Turpin calmly walks out, slamming the door behind him.

INT. BARON BOMINE’S RESIDENCE - BATHROOM

Igor is on the floor, braced against the side of the bathtub and the edge of the sink. He twists his body; there are terrible cracking and popping sounds, and he gasps in pain, then WRENCHES HIMSELF TO THE LEFT-

CRACK.

SWISH TO:

Igor clicking the backbrace back on. He looks out the window, determined.

EXT. BARON BOMINE’S RESIDENCE - NIGHT

Igor exits the house, heading down the steps, walking with a purpose. Moments afterwards, Lorelei bursts out.

IGOR
Go back to sleep-
 
96.

LORELEI
Igor, don’t do this, don’t go-

IGOR
I’m sorry Lorelei.

LORELEI
You can stay here, with me, and
forget all this-

IGOR
I cannot forget.

LORELEI
This is a man who has already attempted to murder you once and very nearly succeeded, please- Igor you’ve never even left London, it isn’t-

Igor stops, turning, yelling in anger for the first time.

IGOR
I must! Don’t you see that? I cannot let Victor die, and I cannot see this horror created in his name, it’s- this is my responsibility. I have to go, Lorelei, I have to stop it.

He stands there, breathing hard, more human than we’ve ever seen him, and touches his back in pain. Lorelei, seeing him as though for the first time, pauses, thinking, and then....

LORELEI
Igor...You once told me of a world you and Victor wanted to create. A world filled with hope instead of fear. It is a beautiful, beautiful dream.
(beat)
Don’t let them turn it into a
nightmare.

Igor nods.


EXT. DOCKS

Out on the docks on the English Channel, Igor is filling in ticket information for his passport. He gets up and goes to board a tramp steamer, giving the ticket to a SAILOR.

He gets halfway up the ramp before the sailor shouts at him.

SAILOR
Oi!	We need a first AND last name.

Igor takes the paper back, staring at it.	IGOR...
 
97.

He takes the pencil, and fills in SURNAME: FRANKENSTEIN.

SLAM TO:

Igor stands out on the deck of the ship as it sails across the choppy Atlantic Ocean.

WE SEE:

Brief shots of Igor travelling. We know where we’re going and why, and we don’t know what we’ll find there.

EXT. ERSKINE VILLAGE - DUSK

A carriage for hire rattles up the road towards a little picturesque village set at the base of rolling hills. Halfway up one of the hills sits a very tall windmill, attached to an old farmhouse.

And at the top of that same hill, surrounded by thick woods, is Castle Erksine...An ancient stone castle, gray against the dimming sky, surrounded by a dry moat.

A storm is brewing on the horizon, lightning crackling inside black clouds. Rain has started to trickle down.

Igor leans out, staring at the castle.

WE SEE:

Igor arriving at the town’s tavern. The coach rattles off, leaving him alone. The street seems oddly empty.

INT. ERSKINE TAVERN - ALMOST CONTINUOUS

Igor comes in, shaking off the rain. He heads quickly to the bar, where he greets a pleasant BELGIAN BAR MAID.

IGOR
Good evening. Listen, I’m just here on business. I was wondering if you wouldn’t mind giving me some directions up to the castle-

The door bursts open, and a BELGIAN COUNCILMAN along with a TOWN HEAVY.

HEAVY
-this is the will of god- you’ve seen what they do up there, you’ve seen the robbed graves- Inspector, tell him-

Turpin (!!!) enters, soaking wet from the rain; Igor flings himself around behind the bar. He crouches there, panicked.
 
98.

TURPIN
What you are dealing with here is
criminals, councilman, you must
remember that: Every second you
allow them to continue their
business up their you are
effectively harboring them.	This
cannot stand.

Igor looks up at the bar-maid; he gives her a winning smile, and the “sssshhhh” gesture. She giggles and nods. He starts crawling towards a back-door.

COUNCILMAN
But surely, not tonight- the storm, the rain-

TURPIN
You think that’s a bloody coincidence!? They’re causing the goddamn storm- you said you saw all the electrical equipment brought in, all the animal corpses too, it’s- they use technology, yeah? The recent storms and flooding have been a product of their folly, they’re to blame for the bad crop.

HEAVY
I’ve talked to the whole town about it, thirty strong men ready to go up there and get those Irish bastards out of here-

Igor makes it to the back-door.

TURPIN
Don’t be a coward, councilman. We must take things into our own hands, don’t you see that? The rumors around your town; grave-robbing, black magic, witchcraft, I am here from Scotland Yard, confirming them. These men are in allegiance with Satan, and must be stopped. They-

Igor slips out silently, but Turpin still turns instantly.

TURPIN (CONT’D)
...must be stopped.

SLAM TO:

Igor, running frantically up hill, through the woods, breathing hard, totally freaking out.

The rain has really started pouring down, the wind getting stronger, and the darkness of night settling in.
 
99.

Igor’s fancy clothes are torn and dirtied, but he doesn’t stop running until- suddenly- pain. The exertion is straining his back; it’s healed, but still weak.

He trips and falls, holding his back, onto a rocky ledge. Down below he can see people coming into town from the harvest riding a plow, holding pitchforks, lighting their way by torchlight.

They’re mobilizing.

Lightning flashes in the clouds.	The rain pours down.


EXT. CASTLE ERSKINE - SHORTLY THEREAFTER

Igor, exhausted, his back aching, makes it to the bridge over the dried out moat. He stumbles and nearly falls, out of breath, filthy and soaking wet.

He creeps around the side of the castle, looking for a way in. Finally, he comes to the base of huge, gnarly, overgrown tree.

Igor climbs up and through the branches, finally at the top, he’s able to plan a jump across to the castle’s top wall walkway.

One of Finnegan’s guards walks past, and Igor nearly falls out of the tree in his effort to conceal himself. The guard passes, and Igor pulls himself up and flings himself across.

EXT. CASTLE ERSKINE - COURTYARD - CONTINUOUS

Igor sneaks along the upper wall, finally coming to a break in the wall where he can see down into the courtyard, where Victor’s laboratory is set up.

It is INCREDIBLE.

Giant-size versions of all his laboratory machinery have been set up, abuzz with power, and a huge scaffolding system has been set up around a raised platform next to one of the towers; the scaffolding goes up fifty feet into the air, and atop it sits Victor’s hypothetical lightning magnet, the
CLOUD HOOK.

On the platform stands Victor and Dettweiler; Victor wears a completely awesome looking buttoned up labcoat, with huge, gnarly looking goggles on his forehead. Dettweiler wears a black version of much the same.

Between them is a massive gurney, but Igor can’t get a good look at what’s on it...

To Igor, who saw all this when it was just a pipe-dream, it’s breathtaking. There are several other scientists/technicians in lab-wear working the machines, supervised by Finnegan, who looks excited.
 
100.

He stealthily moves to the lower level, and quietly sneaks through the lab, moving towards Victor and Dettweiler on the platform. And as the gurney tilts up, there it is:

The PROMETHEUS is just over ten feet tall, stitched together for over two dozen different donors. Its body is gargantuan and misshapen; its head is oddly shaped, the face wide and bizarre, a mess of features stretched and jigsawed together to create a simulation of humanity.

Igor watches as Victor goes under one of the big machines, into the inner-workings.

...UNDER THE
MACHINE...

Victor, goggles down, is fiddling with dials and wires; the machinery around him has begun to spark and glow with energy. It’s powering up.

IGOR
Victor.

Victor turns wto see Igor, having snuck in from the other side, lit by the flashes of electricity give the cramped space an ethereal light. He doesn’t seem to have any kind of reaction.

VICTOR
How-

IGOR
You have to stop the experiment.

DETTWEILER (O.S.)
Almost done down there?

VICTOR
You came all this way-

IGOR
Turpin’s in the town.

VICTOR
What?

IGOR
He’s in the town, he’s coming here-

VICTOR
But that’s absurd, he has no
jurisdiction-

IGOR
I really don’t think that matters
to him anymore.

VICTOR
...You’re lying, you’re just trying to drag me down again, did my father send you-
 
101.

IGOR
It’s a soldier, Victor.

Victor stops dead.

IGOR (CONT’D)
He’s used you.

VICTOR
...no-

IGOR
You’ve created the prototype for a weapon, Victor, a living weapon-

VICTOR
Absurd- I won’t- I don’t believe it-

IGOR
Have you known me to lie?	Once?
Ever?

The machine sparks, and Victor flinches.

IGOR (CONT’D)
Finnegan tried to have me killed, Victor. I’ve come here to save you, as I believe he intends to kill you too when you’ve outlived your usefulness and given him what he wants. We can still get out of this, Victor, but you must stop the experiment.

FINNEGAN (O.S.)
Victor, what on earth are you doing down there-

Victor stares at Igor. Finnegan peers down at them, then jerks back.

FINNEGAN (CONT’D)
Guards!	Guards!	Intruder!

Igor darts out

FROM UNDER THE
MACHINE

And makes mad dash across the laboratory, but he’s tackled and dragged down by two of Finnegan’s goons.

IGOR
No- Victor, help me!

Victor, coming out from under the machine, seems a million miles away; his expression is unreadable.

FINNEGAN
Breaking and entering, really?
High drama!	Intrigue!
(MORE)
 
102.

FINNEGAN (CONT'D)

Take him away, we’ll deal with him after the exp-

IGOR
Don’t do this, Victor, don’t let it happen-

One of the guards punches Igor in the face, shutting him up.
Victor flinches.

DETTWEILER
The machines are ready.	Mr.
Frankenstein, if you please.

Victor takes one last look at Igor, then steps up onto the platform. Finnegan hops on alongside him, and nods to a lab tech nearby, who throws a massive switch; with a great creaking, and rattling roar, the platform begins to rise up through the gantries, towards the swirling storm high above.

FINNEGAN
Don’t let that parasite distract you, Victor. He’s just trying to steal your moment. He had his chance to be a part of this, and he gave it up.

Victor’s silent, watching Igor scream up to him, muted by the roar of the machines.

DETTWEILER
Everything is running at one
hundred percent efficiency.	Your
designs are flawless.	Priming the
Cloud Hook now.

Dettweiler flips a switch, and above them, at the top of the elevator machinery, the “Cloud Hook” glows to life with a rumble; they’re easily thirty feet in the air now.

Victor looks over his Prometheus, massive and menacing.

VICTOR
Is it a soldier?

Finnegan falters, looking to Dettweiler, who’s as expressionless as ever.

DOWN IN THE
COURTYARD

Igor’s being dragged inside by the two heavies.

IGOR
No, this isn’t- this isn’t-

OUTSIDE...
 
103.

Turpin and his mob of villages have arrived, in a fervor.
They’re using the plow to ram the main gate, again and again.

...INSIDE

The thugs are momentarily distracted by the sound at the front gates.

Igor wrenches his body, snapping the back-brace shut on one of his captor’s hands. The man screams in agony, and Igor kick’s out the other man’s knee, effortlessly circus rolling out of his grasp.

He takes off running, shoving past the lab technicians and jumping over equipment before jumping up onto the bottom of the scaffolding, rapidly climbing up towards the still ascending platform.

UP ON THE
PLATFORM

VICTOR
Is it a soldier?	Answer me.

DETTWEILER
Yes.	It is.

FINNEGAN
Dettweiler, really-

VICTOR
My...my central pursuit has been
the preservation of life, and
you’ve- you’ve deceived me into
building a killing machine.

The platform grinds to a halt, now suspended fifty feet up, atop the gantry way, the Cloud Hook crackling with energy next to them.

Down below, the machinery’s grinding causes Igor to slip, nearly plummeting off the scaffolding.

FINNEGAN
Deceived you, really? Is that what I did? Did you ever even think to ask? Of course not, because for all your genius, all your inventions, you’re still a small mind, Frankenstein. You deserve to be used, you require it, because you can only see the little picture, sight, but no vision!
(straightens himself)

Victor, now isn’t the time nor the place for a philosophical debate. Activate the Cloud Hook.

Victor just stares at him.
 
104.

FINNEGAN (CONT’D)
What are you waiting for, activate the-

VICTOR
You tried to kill Igor.

FINNEGAN
I- damn it- Do it now, Frankenstein-

VICTOR
I’ve perverted everything I hoped
to achieve.	I’m a fool.

FINNEGAN
Activate the hook, you’ve got no
choice-

VICTOR
I beg to differ.

Victor begins violently yanking electrodes and wires out of the Prometheus, ignoring Finnegan.

FINNEGAN
What’re- No, damn it, Dettweiler,
stop him!

Dettweiler draws a pistol.	Victor stops, staring at it.

DETTWEILER
I have wanted to tell you, Victor: You are a child. You know nothing of the world. Now stop this foolish tantrum or I will take action to ensure that this experiment is a a success.

Victor stares at him for a moment, chuckles, and goes right back to yanking out the electrodes.

Dettweiler raises the gun.

DETTWEILER (CONT’D) Pathetic. I told you, I never work with a partner.

Victor’s eyes flit to the right of Dettweiler and then back.

VICTOR
Funny.	I do.

Dettweiler is GRABBED FROM BEHIND BY IGOR, PULLING HIMSELF UP OVER THE RAILING. Dettweiler’s shot goes wild, hitting the Cloud Hook.

It sparks, insanely bright for a moment, and Dettweiler shoves Igor backwards, nearly off the edge, raising his gun-
 
105.

The Cloud-Hook EXPLODES TO LIFE, DOZENS OF LIGHTNING BOLTS STRIKING AT ONCE, A DELUGE OF PURE ENERGY CRASHING IN FROM ALL POINTS OF THE CLOUD ABOVE IN A BLINDING, DEAFENING BARRAGE OF LIGHT HEAT AND SOUND.

The damaged Cloud Hook comes off its hinges, smashing Dettweiler off the platform; he plummets down into an electrical console, BAM! Dead.

The Hook’s restraints snap, and it swings free, now SPRAYING LIGHTNING INTO THE LAB, AN INDOOR ELECTRICAL STORM OF INCREDIBLE INTENSITY, frying Finnegan’s goons and scientists, overloading the machines and causing them to burst into blue flame!

VICTOR (CONT’D)
Unexpected-

FINNEGAN
No!	No!	NO!	What’ve you done,
you idiots-

The entire platform framework, blasted by the lightning, destabilizes, blowing apart, causing the platform to drop herky-jerky down through the center of the structure, Igor, Victor and Finnegan struggling to hold on.

The Cloud Hook, overcharged with energy, EXPLODES!

VICTOR IS SENT FLIPPING TEN FEET HORIZONTALLY INTO THE MASSIVE ELECTRICAL COILS- THEY COLLAPSE APART IN A SHOWER OF SPARKS AND BLAZING ELECTRICITY-

IGOR
Victor!

THE PLATFORM FLIPS as it completely comes free of the elevator machinery, and Igor goes crashing to the-

SLAM TO BLACK.

FADE IN:

The air is choked with smoke. Fires burn all around, contained but unbearably hot. Igor lays face down on the ground, half conscious.

The plow again crashes into the gate; it’s splintering now, starting to crack. Soon, they’ll be inside.

FINNEGAN (O.S.)
(somewhere in the smoke)
Igor!	Is that you down there?

Igor blinks, confused, and then there’s a gunshot!
Finnegan’s trying to freaking shoot him!

Igor hurries away, moving blindly through the smoke; he can hear but not see Finnegan. He trips for a moment over something; it’s the gurney.
 
106.

It’s empty.

Igor can hear the breathing behind him.	He turns, slowly.
And there it is...

The Prometheus towers over him, staring down at Igor with a face that conveys absolutely no emotion, a completely vacant, blank slate.

There’s another crash! at the front gate. The monster glances at the gate, then back at Igor.

IGOR
All right...easy...easy...

Another crash at the gates. The Prometheus’s face remains entirely blank.

IGOR (CONT’D)
Just-

The Prometheus grunts, and then SWATS IGOR INTO THE AIR; he bounces hard off some equipment, damaging it, and lands on the ground bent double in pain; he tries to stand, but finds he can’t...

...The damn back-brace is broken, trapping him into his old, hunchbacked position. He can barely move, much less stand.

EXT. CASTLE ERSKINE - CONTINUOUS

The villagers are about to drive the plow into the door again when THE PROMETHEUS CRASHES THROUGH THE CASTLE GATES FROM THE

INSIDE! It FLIPS THE PLOW onto the villagers, and begins TEARING its way through them, punching, swatting and smashing its way across the bridge.

Turpin is knocked down, and stares in horror at the monster.

TURPIN
A...A demon, a demon from Hell...

The Prometheus continues brawling through the townspeople, but Turpin stands, staggering inside: bigger fish to fry.

INT. CASTLE ERSKINE - COURTYARD LABORATORY - CONTINUOUS

Turpin stumbles in, still looking over his shoulder, and then turns to see the lab. The smoke is thick in the courtyard, now; you can barely see in some areas.

Finnegan prowls through the smoke, gun drawn, twitchy.

Igor, on nearly the other side of the courtyard, struggles with his back-brace, seeing Finnegan searching for him. He crawls, desperate.
 
107.

Turpin moves amongst the anarchy, in awe of all the burning, sparking, exploding equipment. He sees Igor crawling, and moves towards him like a bullet.

IGOR
Inspector Turpin- please listen-
you don’t know, you don’t know
what’s happened here, you’re not-

Turpin isn’t hearing it; he grabs Igor, yanking him up; Igor can barely move. Turpin’s got a look of insane exhilaration on his face; this is it, the moment he’s waited for!

TURPIN
I’ve got you.	I’ve finally got
you.

IGOR
Please- you’re in danger-

Finnegan, up on a bank of equipment, sees movement through the smoke, raises his gun and fires.

Turpin blinks, releasing Igor.

TURPIN
I- I don’t-

He collapses forward, Igor catching him as they fall to the ground. Igor rips open Turpin’s shirt, trying to put pressure on the bloody gunshot wound in his chest.

IGOR
No- no no-

Turpin, in shock, coughing up blood, looks up at Igor, watching as Igor tears off his own sleeve, trying to stop the bleeding.

TURPIN
Why’re you- trying to save me?

IGOR
I’m a doctor.	It’s what I do.

Turpin, through the shock, is looking around at all the technology; he didn’t understand, he knows that now. By god, he thought he knew, but he had no idea.

TURPIN
I-...I’ve made a terrible mistake.

As Igor works frantically, Turpin’s clouded eyes drift up to the lightning storm raging in the clouds above him; bright and celestial. It all hits him at once, sanity flooding back in.
 
108.

TURPIN (CONT’D)
My daughter...What have I done, who will take care of my daughter- I left her with my sister, she can’t support- she can’t- my daughter, who will...

Igor, horrified, watches as the light fades from Turpin’s eyes, and the body goes limp in his arms.

OUTSIDE...

The Prometheus’ rampage continues.

INSIDE...

FINNEGAN
Who the bloody hell is that?

Finnegan is climbing down one of the fallen tesla coils, gun in hand. Igor looks up, covered in Turpin’s blood and his own, shaking.

FINNEGAN (CONT’D)
Ha.	Ahaha.	Look at this mess,
look at this mess you’ve made.

Finnegan’s upper-class demeanor is cracking as he approaches Igor, reloading his gun. The fall from the platform tore his clothes and mussed his hair; he looks dangerous, sharklike.

Igor gently sets down Turpin, trying to force himself to his feet, find some way to defend himself, but the back-brace makes it impossible.

OUTSIDE...

Outside, the monster begins to violently retreat down the hill, the remaining mob giving chase.

INSIDE...

Finnegan finishes reloading his gun, and seems to think; looking at all the destruction has “flustered” him.

FINNEGAN (CONT’D)
Why is this good? Is this what you wanted? To stand in the way of the science? Who gave you the right?

Igor, trembling, stares at Finnegan; there’s a tremendous hate in his eyes, and Finnegan, feeling it, steps back, intimidated despite his position of total control.

IGOR
You’re a monster.

FINNEGAN
No.	No I’m not.	I think you’ll
find I’m quite human.
 
109.

Finnegan raises his gun. Igor just stares at him evenly, unafraid. Finnegan steadies his aim.

VICTOR
Finnegan!

Finnegan looks up slowly, turning to see VICTOR FRANKENSTEIN, hunched in pain, his hair wild, covered in ash and more than a little burnt, but still very much alive. He holds two ends of a huge severed electrical cord.

FINNEGAN
Victor!	You’re...alive,
fascinating-

VICTOR
You wanted me to create death.

Finnegan laughs, and then realizes the cord Victor holds goes down into the base of the massive collapsed tesla coil directly to his left.

Finnegan tries to raise his gun- but Victor joins the severed cord-

A BLAST OF ELECTRICITY BLOWS FINNEGAN ACROSS THE ROOM.

VICTOR (CONT’D)
There.	I’ve created death.

Victor tosses down the cord in disgust. Igor struggles a moment, falling. He lays there next to Turpin’s corpse, listening to the sounds of battle fade outside, collecting himself, and then pushes as hard as he can-

-and breaks free of the back-brace. He stares at it laying twisted on the floor and shoves himself to his feet, wiping the blood off his face: he is MESSED UP.

He looks around, and sees Victor futilely trying to put out the fires on the equipment.

IGOR
You saved my life again.

VICTOR
Help me put out these damn fires-

IGOR
The fires?	But Victor-

VICTOR
With Finnegan dead we’ll never get this quality of equipment again! Electron coils, particle transducers-

IGOR
 
Victor-
 
110.

VICTOR
Help me, damn it, it’ll-

IGOR
NO VICTOR.	You’re going to come
with me, and you’re going to help
me kill the Prometheus-

VICTOR
Kill it!?	Why on earth-

It comes out of Igor with the force of a hurricane:

IGOR
Damn it, enough! Enough! I’ve seen you do wondrous things Victor, some terrible but wondrous things. You’re the greatest mind of your generation, but your blindness has already cost too much!

(summons up courage) I’ve seen the way your father treats you! This will never be good enough for him! Nothing you ever do will be good enough for him, you could resurrect all of England and he would scoff and call you a disappointment! You can’t bring your brother back!

At this, Victor stops trying to put out the fires. He stares into the flames; the lab continues to explode around them, but he’s motionless.

IGOR (CONT’D)
You were the one who gave me the strength I needed to become the man I wanted to be. Now trust me, please. Stop pretending not to care about anyone or anything, and Victor, damn it, grow up and help me stop this thing before it hurts anyone else. BE A MAN AND TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR CREATION!

Electricity crackles. The fires burn. In the distance we can hear pandemonium; yelling and screaming, people afraid.

Victor turns to Igor, very quickly wiping away tears.

VICTOR
I don’t suppose you have...a very, very large shovel?

Igor smiles.
 
111.

EXT. THE WINDMILL

Victor and Igor, bruised, battered and bloody, approach the massive Dutch Windmill on the side of the hill; the villagers are gathered around it.

At first it appears they have the Prometheus trapped in the house portion, but then the Prometheus tromps out and takes a few people down, before going back in.

APPROACHING THE
CROWD

Victor and Igor try to get through the crowd, and can’t; Victor draws and fires Finnegan’s gun.

The crowd parts like the red sea, and Igor and Victor move through, with the gun still raised.

VICTOR
Please remain calm.	We are
unlicensed medical professionals.

INT. THE WINDMILL - FARMHOUSE

Victor kicks in the door; Igor comes in through a massive hole in the wall next to the door. They exchange a look.

The farmhouse is sparse, and the inside is completely destroyed, broken furniture everywhere.

LITTLE GIRL (DUTCH)
Help me, please help me.

Victor and Igor turn to see an adorable blonde girl standing nearby, petrified in fear.

IGOR
It’s alright, we’re here to-

The MONSTER SMASHES OUT OF A ROOM TO THEIR RIGHT, FLOORING IGOR. Victor opens fire wildly as the creature crosses the room; he mostly misses, and the bullets that do hit have almost no effect.

The creature grabs the girl in one of its massive hands, roars at Victor and crashes through a wall into the inside of the windmill.

INT. THE WINDMILL - CONTINUOUS

The interior of the windmill stretches out above them, the inside lit by torches. There are a series of flimsy wooden platforms built around the central windmill machinery, connected by diagonal ladders, leading up to the top.

The monster stands at the bottom, above a big well full of water, dunking the terrified little girl.
 
112.

Victor hurriedly picks up one of the long, sharp steel posts they use as bolts on the well, as Igor strafes around the monster.

VICTOR
HEY.	WANKER.

The monster takes notice of Victor.

VICTOR (CONT’D)
I’m your creator. I’m the one that brought you back to life, do you understand?

The monster stares at him, that blank face again...THEN ROARS and flings one of the torches on the wall. Victor dodges, and the torch hits a table full of unlit lanterns WHICH EXPLODE INTO FLAME.

VICTOR (CONT’D)
Bloody hell-

The Prometheus charges, still holding the girl, and Victor is forced into a frantic, pulse pounding chase up the interior of the windmill, complicated in four ways:

NUMBER 1: The monster’s weight is too much for the ladders and the platforms, which crumple mere moments after it climbs onto them.

NUMBER 2: The monster, still clutching the little girl, is swinging WILDLY at Victor, repeatedly smashing the windmill’s machinery, thusly destabilizing the entire structure.

NUMBER 3: The fire started at the base is rapidly spreading up the old, papery structure, engulfing everything, and starting to fill the interior with thick black smoke.

NUMBER 4: Igor is in hot pursuit, but he’s being forced to run, jump and climb up the platforms AS THEY COLLAPSE.

Victor, reaching the uppermost platform, abruptly turns, ducking around the central windmill milling-engine. This outsmarts and surprises the Prometheus, and Victor DRIVES THE STEEL ROD THROUGH ITS HEART.

The Prometheus falters, teetering over what’s now a straight drop nearly sixty feet down. It looks down at the rod sticking out of its chest, and DROPS THE LITTLE GIRL-

Victor dives and catches her hand, swinging her to Igor on the collapsing platform below them. Igor catches the girl and rolls, putting her out through the one window, onto the passing fan of the windmill.

WE SEE OUTSIDE
 
113.

The girl is safely carried down to the ground, and then the
WINDMILL’S FAN CRACKS AND FALLS, BURNING, SCATTERING THE CROWD-

BACK ON THE TOP
LEVEL...

The monster seems ready to topple into the abyss, when suddenly it YANKS THE STEEL ROD OUT OF ITS CHEST AND FLINGS IT AT VICTOR. It impales him through the shoulder and sends him flying backwards, embedding in the wall, pinning Victor there like a bug.

Igor screams; his best friend is mortally wounded. He pulls himself up onto the last platform as the one beneath it collapses. The Prometheus takes a few huge swings at him, but Igor ducks and rolls, clown-style,

The final, top platform begins to fracture and come apart; they’ll all be plunged into the fire-

Igor, thinking quickly, grabs a handful of burning embers from the edge of the platform and flings them into the monster’s face; blinded it turns, and Igor pushes up, off the wall, kick himself forward and-

THROWS HIS WEIGHT ON THE MONSTER’S BACK, CAUSING IT TO FALL FORWARD ONTO THE SHARP STEEL ROD, IMPALING IT THROUGH ITS SECOND HEART.

The Prometheus gives one last tremendous scream of rage, right into Victor’s face...and dies. Its slumping dead weight further buckles the platform.

VICTOR (CONT’D)
I didn’t mean it-

IGOR
What?

VICTOR
(frantic)

Those things I said back in England, you have to know I didn’t mean any of it. I was just upset, I respect you- more than any other person, you must know- Igor I’m so sorry-

Igor goes and tries to wrench the pole out of the wall. It’s no good; it’s in there deep. Victor screams in pain.

VICTOR (CONT’D)
You have to get out of here, you
have to go-

IGOR
I’m not going to leave you here-
 
114.

Igor begins pushing on the monster; it sloooowly slides up the shiskabob, far too slowly with the windmill collapsing at this rate. Victor grabs Igor with his good arm.

VICTOR
Igor this is what I’ve earned.	I
did this to myself.

Igor stares at him: maybe he’s right? The windmill continues to collapse.

VICTOR (CONT’D)
The well, Igor.	If you jump you
can make it, I know you can-

Igor looks down at the well, far below them.	Maybe he could.
He readies himself, measuring the distance.

VICTOR (CONT’D)
(gasping his words through
agony)

Listen, Igor, listen to me. I didn’t kill Straussman. I found him in the living room, I thought he was asleep but then I saw the needle...and then the pragmatist in me just took over, as he always does, and he wasn’t a man anymore just pieces, just new equipment. I swear to you though I didn’t ki-

IGOR
I believe you.

VICTOR
Good, now I can- I can stay here-
Igor, you must go, it’s-

IGOR
Oh, you’ve sealed my fate. There’s no way I’m going to leave you now.

VICTOR
What?	Why!?

IGOR
Because you didn’t kill Igor
Straussman.

Igor throws all his weight into one more push, and, miraculously, the Prometheus drops, falling through the center level of the windmill, plummeting down into the fires.

Igor glances down again at the well, now also surrounded by fire and jagged rubble.

IGOR (CONT’D)
Give me your hand.

Victor nods, and takes Igor’s hand; Igor begins to agonizingly pull him up the steel rod-
 
115.

EXT. THE WINDMILL - CONTINUOUS

The top level of the windmill drops in, collapsing, and then, with a series of ember filled explosions, the rest of the windmill collapsing down with it in a huge heap of wreckage.

The villagers step back, in shock.

WIDE SHOT:

The rubble of the windmill burns.

FADE TO BLACK.

HOLD ON BLACK.

Zzt. Zzzt. Electrical crackling. Little spots of light filling the screen and then ZAP

SMASH TO:

Turpin sits up, gasping in air, the Lazarus fork on his neck sparking wildly!

EXT. BELGIAN COTTAGE - SUNRISE

The sun is rising over a mountain range. The little cottage has clearly been abandoned for some time; Castle Erskine is in the distance, still leaking smoke up into the brightening sky. From here we have a beautiful view of a rustic lake.

Turpin, his chest bandaged, sits staring out over the water, at the sunset; he’s clearly deep in thought. Igor slowly approaches him.

Turpin speaks without looking at him.

TURPIN
My entire life I have strived in the pursuit of my beliefs. Beliefs in God, in the law...in a world with rules, rules to preserve what matters in a world filled with anarchy, greed, and evil. I suppose I needed them, the rules. Needed them so much I let them control my choices, my decisions, I...

Turpin glances at Igor.

TURPIN (CONT’D)
I don’t know you, hunchback. Don’t know Victor. Maybe I thought I did...
(beat)
In those last moments, I wasn’t
thinking about the law, or right
and wrong, or even...even God.
(MORE)
 
116.

TURPIN (CONT’D)

All I wanted, all that mattered, is that I would see my daughter again. And you’ve given me that.
(beat)
I don’t imagine that I have much
credence left at the yard,
but...Should you return to England,
I can see to it you won’t be
troubled any further.

Igor gives it a beat, and then smiles. The two of them sit staring out at the water.

EXT. BELGIAN COTTAGE - ROUND BACK

Victor, heavily bandaged and clearly a bit weary from his wounds and considerably rough night, is readying two horses, packing his remaining equipment into the saddlebags. Igor stands nearby.

VICTOR
Well, brilliant, good for him, but we’re certainly not going back to England.

IGOR
...we’re not?

VICTOR
No, I’m through with Great Britain; nothing left for me there. I think perhaps you’re quite right about my father, for now, and I’ve been expelled from school, hunted by the law, and betrayed by a power-hungry nobleman, thoroughly electrocuted and finally impaled by a monster of my own idiotic creation and nearly burnt to death in a Belgian windmill.
(laughs)
I think it’s time I started fresh, yes?

IGOR
But Victor-

VICTOR
America! Now there’s a place that isn’t afraid of progress; I’m confident we’ll be able to flourish and thrive out in the colonies. You and I, back to working together with no interlopers, I now having a much better understanding of the technology as well as the proper way to treat my fellow man-

IGOR
Victor, I...
 
117.

VICTOR
Yes?

Igor fidgets, nervous, unsure how to say what’s in his heart.
Victor waits, looking oblivious.

IGOR
I can’t go with you.
(quickly)

I would, I- I can’t. Lorelei is waiting for me back in London. I love her, Victor, and there are-opportunities for me- I can have a life of my own, Victor. A real life.

Victor stares at him. Igor drops his eyes, terrified; he knows what’s coming.

VICTOR
Well...then.	I suppose that’s
perfectly reasonable.

IGOR
...what?

VICTOR
(haltingly)

You have made incredible sacrifices in the purpose of our cause, shown shocking amounts of tenacity, bravery and loyalty to me as a friend and collaborator, it would be wrong of me to ask you to give up the opportunity to be with the woman you love and-

IGOR
Victor!

Igor rushes to and embraces Victor, who grunts in pain and generally looks uncomfortable. Igor holds on anyway, crying, overcome with joy.

IGOR (CONT’D)
You are a good man, Victor
Frankenstein.	I knew you were a
good man.

At this, Victor allows himself a small, warm smile, unseen by Igor.

LATER...

Turpin is readying a horse, whilst Victor is astride one, trotting away down the road from Igor.

IGOR (CONT’D)
Goodbye Victor!
 
118.

VICTOR
Goodbye to you too, my dearest
friend.

Igor looks sad, watching Victor get further away, and then Victor turns, touching his painful injured soldier, yelling back to Igor.

VICTOR (CONT’D)
You know it isn’t over, Igor. When the time comes, you’ll come back; you’re not fated to be some country doctor, you are a genius, and you will help to change the world. It’s your destiny.

Igor is about to reply, but then realizes he can’t formulate a response. Victor smiles.

VICTOR (CONT’D)
Ha!	Yah!

Victor kicks his horse, and it speeds up, off down the hill.
Igor watches him go.

WE MOVE INTO A
MONTAGE AS TIME
PASSES...

Igor is emotionally reunited with Lorelei.

Turpin is reunited with his daughter Rebecca, who tearfully embraces him. We also see Turpin making his apologies at Scotland Yard; Alistair seems happy to have him back. In his office, he quietly tears up one of the “WANTED: HUNCHBACK” posters.

We watch Igor’s life: We see him giving check-ups, his doctor job has come through. He watches as Lorelei teaches a ballet class to a group of young women.

Igor and Lorelei, out at the circus, watching the high flier and aerialists, having fun. Igor watches the clowns cleaning up the center ring...

INT. BARON BOMINE’S RESIDENCE - KITCHEN

Igor is cooking with the chefs, having a good time. He looks great, happy, healthy. The butler enters.

BUTLER
Delivery for you, Master Igor.

Igor looks up, confused, washing his hands.
 
119.

EXT. BARON BOMINE’S RESIDENCE - CONTINUOUS

Igor comes out, signing for a parcel being delivered to him. As the messenger boy leaves, Igor inspects the parcel. It’s small, addressed simply to “IGOR.”

There’s a beat, and Igor tears open the brown paper. He stops dead.

It’s a mint condition, first edition copy of THOMPSON’S ANATOMY.

Igor opens it, gently, lovingly. In the front cover, the name DR. CLAUS FRANKENSTEIN has been written...and crossed out. A note in familiar handwriting beneath this reads:

“I- Monument Valley, Utah. I have done something incredible. -F.”

Lorelei, at the front door, stands looking out at him; he’s staring down at the book. She knows something’s up.

ALORELEI
Igor...what is it?

Igor snaps the book shut, turning to face her. He smiles; “wellllll.....” Lorelei sighs, and then laughs, shaking her head...

SMASH TO:

MONUMENT VALLEY - UTAH - RACING THROUGH THE DESERT

The insanely surreal and beautiful buttes of Monument Valley tower over the prairie.

Atop one of the buttes, a storm is raging; clouds swirling unnaturally, crackling with purple lightning.
