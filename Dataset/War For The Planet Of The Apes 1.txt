BLACK SCREEN

PRIMITIVE WAR DRUMS POUND OMINOUSLY... as a LEGEND BEGINS:

Fifteen years ago, a scientific experiment gone wrong gave RISE to a species of

intelligent apes… and destroyed most of humanity with a virus that became known as the Simian Flu.

The word “RISE” lingers, moving toward us as it FADES...

With the DAWN of a new ape civilization led by Caesar, the surviving humans struggled to

coexist... but fighting finally broke out when a rebel ape, Koba, led a vengeful attack against the humans.

The word “DAWN” lingers, moving toward us as it FADES...

The humans sent a distress call to a military base in the North where all that remained of the U.S. Army was gathered. A ruthless Special Forces Colonel and his hardened battalion were dispatched to exterminate the apes. Evading capture for the last two years, Caesar is now rumored to be marshaling the fight from a hidden command base in the woods... as the WAR rages on…

The word “WAR” lingers, moving toward us... TURNING RED as the REST OF THE TITLE FADES UP and the DRUMS ABRUPTLY STOP:

WAR FOR THE PLANET OF THE APES

We HEAR sounds of nature.	Then the quiet SNAPPING OF TWIGS.
BOOTS CRUNCHING stealthily through grass.	HUSHED BREATHING.

HARD CUT TO:

TIGHT CREEPING STEADICAM BEHIND THE HELMETS OF HUMAN SOLDIERS

Scrawled on the helmet closest to us are the words “MONKEY KILLER.” Others pass through frame: “BEDTIME FOR BONZO,” “ENDANGERED SPECIES”... The SOLDIERS climb slowly up --

A STEEP, DENSELY WOODED HILL

The troops wear threadbare camo fatigues, dark camo paint on their faces; each bears the hand-drawn insignia “AΩΩ” on their bodies: some on their uniforms, some tattooed on their arms. Many carry GUNS, others MILITARY-GRADE CROSSBOWS.

One of the men comes to a halt, quickly WHISPERS:

SOLDIER
Captain...!
 



(CONTINUED)
 
2.

CONTINUED:

The CAPTAIN holds up a hand, signalling the unit to stop. He joins the Soldier, who points up ahead. The Captain peers THROUGH HIS GUN SITE to see --

THREE APES AND THEIR HORSES

up on a ridge 100 yards away. Two of the APES stand guard furtively, one clutching a spear, the other an automatic rifle -- while the third waters the horses at a stream.

The Captain lines up his cross-hairs... when ANOTHER SOLDIER creeps right up behind him, reaching for him... but as the hand lifts into frame, we see -- it’s an APE HAND...

The ape hand GRABS the Captain’s shoulder; startled, he quickly turns -- and the ape soldier (RED) POINTS up to --

THE CANOPY OF TREES OVERHEAD -- where another HELMETED APE crouches, hidden, looking down at them -- the ape in the tree POINTS toward the ridge... The Captain follows the gesture to a LONG, LOW TRENCH WALL of logs and stones, disguised behind leaves and branches.

Captain turns back to Red, nods; WHISPERS INTO HIS HEADSET:

CAPTAIN
Echo two-six to command. Colonel, we have eyes on three Kong in the north woods. A couple of our donkeys think there are others here too... Maybe this is it, maybe the base is near.
(listens carefully)
Yes sir... Yes sir, copy. Over.

He clicks off, quickly waves up more soldiers from the rear. They begin pulling weapons and ammo from heavy rucksacks that Red and TWO OTHER APE SOLDIERS carry on their backs. The apes seem subservient, treated as no more than pack-mules.

CAPTAIN (CONT’D)
You!	Over here!

An ape scurries over; the Captain pulls out a grenade launcher -- turns to the men:

CAPTAIN (CONT’D)
Preacher...

PREACHER, a fresh-faced grunt still in his teens, crawls up nervously with his CROSSBOW; the Captain points at the three apes up on the ridge:
 




(CONTINUED)
 
3.

CONTINUED: (2)

CAPTAIN (CONT’D)
The one with the gun...

Preacher NODS as the Captain readies his own weapon, lining up on the partially-hidden trench wall. Beside them, soldiers are sliding BAYONET BLADES onto their rifles...

All eyes on the Captain as he counts down silently with his fingers. “3... 2... 1” --

--	and Preacher fires an arrow into the ape with the gun!

The other two apes are just starting to react -- when the Captain sends two grenades screaming across the woods... BLASTING OPEN the trench wall --

--	and suddenly SCORES OF STUNNED APES begin chaotically FALLING out from the trench behind it! They TUMBLE off-balance, dropping weapons (guns, spears, bows & arrows) as --

THE HUMANS OPEN FIRE, picking them off in a hail of bullets, arrows, and grenades. The two apes by the stream jump on their horses, starting to flee, when a SNIPER takes one out! But the APE WITH THE SPEAR manages to escape, SCREECHING in warning as he disappears into the distance.

The Captain turns to Preacher and the other men, waving them on -- we can’t even hear his voice over the DIN OF BATTLE:

CAPTAIN (CONT’D)
(COME ON!!)

The humans charge up the hill, continuing their assault --

CUT TO:

THE APE WITH SPEAR ON HORSEBACK RACING THROUGH THE WOODS

Hooves pounding dirt! SPEAR drives his horse faster and faster. He CRIES OUT again in warning, his screech echoing through the trees --

BACK TO:

THE BATTLE ON THE HILL

The apes desperately return fire as they begin retreat, more and more apes cut down by the relentless human onslaught --

CUT TO:
 
4.



SPEAR ON HIS HORSE

still SCREECHING as he tears through the woods -- when suddenly he hears a rising CHORUS OF SCREECHING in response. He pulls his horse to an abrupt stop, seeing...

A BATTALION OF APES ON HORSEBACK appearing through the trees.

With a final WAR CRY Spear spins his horse, the apes flooding at him, as he leads the charge back toward the battle --

CUT TO:

THE BATTLE ON THE HILL

Preacher (the fresh-faced grunt) frantically fires more shots from his crossbow -- when he sees his hip-quiver is out of arrows, shouts to Red over the noise:

PREACHER
Reload!

Red quadrupeds over, and Preacher starts fishing out another fully-loaded quiver from his rucksack...

SLOW ZOOM IN ON RED as he coldly watches the ape massacre.

Preacher finishes strapping on the quiver, about to re-enter the fray -- when he -- and Red -- both look up to see --

A TRIO OF SPIRALLING SMOKE TRAILS HISSING BALLETICALLY through the air from high above! The trails smack the ground and start to tumble, spewing THICK SMOKE everywhere!

Alarmed, Preacher peers up at the SOUND OF HORSES; we see --

THE APE CAVALRY ARRIVING ON THE TOPMOST RIDGE

The riders swing primitive SMOKE BOMBS in the air, launching them from their slings -- and a second wave of smoke trails hits the ground --

On his horse, SPEAR SCREECHES to the tide of retreating apes around him -- he RAISES HIS WEAPON, rallying them to stop and join him in a counter-assault --

DOWN BELOW

Preacher and the other human soldiers are caught in a DENSE SEA OF SMOKE, gasping, scrambling blindly, unable to see more than a foot in front of their faces -- when TORRENTS OF WHIZZING SPEARS AND ARROWS start to rain down from above!
 



(CONTINUED)
 
5.

CONTINUED:

Preacher recoils in horror as SMOKE-SHROUDED SILHOUETTES of soldiers drop around him, their SCREAMS coming from all sides amidst the WHOOSH, WHOOSH, WHOOSH of spears and arrows -- it’s like a hallucinatory nightmare... A disembodied scream comes from somewhere in the fog --

AGONIZED VOICE
RETREAT!!!

Preacher dives to his stomach, clawing for cover -- he TUMBLES violently down into A DITCH.

He tries to catch his breath -- turns to find himself face to face with the bodies of fallen soldiers. One is the Captain. The ROAR OF APPROACHING APES grows louder and louder...

Panicked, Preacher clambers over the corpses, pulls the
Captain’s headset off, clicks it on with trembling hands:

PREACHER
Colonel -– Colonel, do you copy?!

An excruciating beat... then a crackle of static... finally a
VOICE -- something almost chilling about how calm it is:

THE COLONEL (V.O.)
Who is this?

PREACHER
Preacher -- it’s Preacher, sir -- !

THE COLONEL (V.O.)
Where are you, soldier? I need your position.

PREACHER
I don’t know -- !

THE COLONEL (V.O.)
(unfazed)

What do you see?

PREACHER
I can’t see anything! We lost a lot of men, sir -- the captain is dead!

THE COLONEL (V.O.)
You’re in command now.

PREACHER
Command, sir? I think it’s just me by myself now!
 



(CONTINUED)
 
6.

CONTINUED: (2)

THE COLONEL (V.O.)
By yourself?

The apes noises are terrifyingly close now --

PREACHER
Sir, I don’t think I’m gonna make it...!

I’m sorry -- I’m so sorry!

THE COLONEL (V.O.)
(silence, solemnly)

I understand, soldier. Just kill as many as you can.

And before Preacher can reply, he peers up to see APE WARRIORS converging around the edge of the ditch, glaring down at him. Preacher freezes, braced for death, and we --

CUT TO:

A TRACKING POV SHOT - MOMENTS LATER

The battle’s grim aftermath, an almost surreal vision of the ravages of war. Apes scavenge for weapons, stripping GUNS AND AMMUNITION off the bodies of fallen human soldiers... WE CONTINUE MOVING TOWARD A TRENCH, where APE BODIES are being lifted out and SCORES OF WOUNDED attended to... as we get closer, apes in the recess below look slowly up at us with reverence... We move DOWN INTO THE TRENCH, more and more apes reacting, nudging each other, alerting everyone to our arrival, even the injured raise their heads...

REVEAL CAESAR

as he strides through the trench; the POV was his. He looks older now, but even more imposing. His hardened expression reveals nothing... but in his eyes we see deep pain, as he takes in the terrible loss and suffering...

He’s trailed by TWO GORILLAS, flanking him on either side: his grizzled lieutenant LUCA and a younger, smaller ALBINO (WINTER), who looks overwhelmed by the carnage around them...

The three of them finally arrive at an area UNDER earth cover, where they find A GROUP OF HUMAN SOLDIERS on their knees, helmets lowered, hands bound behind their backs. Spear and other ape warriors stand guard. Seeing Caesar, Spear supplicates deferentially.

Caesar turns to the prisoners as they lift their frightened eyes to his. We see Preacher among them.
 




(CONTINUED)
 
7.

CONTINUED:

But one soldier’s helmet is still lowered. Spear reaches down and yanks the helmet off -- revealing Red. Red defiantly avoids Caesar’s gaze.

Spear tosses the helmet to Caesar. Caesar examines it, sees the hand-drawn “AΩΩ.” He looks at the other soldiers, notices the same symbol crudely tattooed on one of the soldiers’ arms, sees it scrawled on some of the uniforms. His eyes find it again on the front of Preacher’s helmet.

PREACHER
(nervous, quiet)

...it’s... Alpha Omega.

Caesar just stares; then LANG, a lean female soldier, “AΩΩ” tattooed on her neck, speaks, quiet defiance under her fear:

LANG
Means we’re the beginning and end.

Humanity’s survival depends on us.

Just then, the apes around Caesar turn, reacting to the arrival of --

MAURICE, the orangutan. Like Caesar, he’s older; there’s a weariness in his eyes that suggests the war has taken a toll on his gentle spirit. Caesar turns to his old friend.

MAURICE
(signs gravely)

[Twenty-two dead. Many more injured.]

Caesar glowers at the soldiers. We see Preacher still staring up at him... finally getting up the courage to utter:

PREACHER
You’re him...	You’re Caesar.

Caesar’s eyes go to Preacher, caught off guard.

PREACHER (CONT’D)
We’ve been looking for you for so long. We heard you had a hidden command base, but we could never find it. Some of us were starting to think you might be dead. But Colonel McCullough said no, you were out here somewhere...

Caesar doesn’t respond, just keeps glaring at the soldiers.
Another soldier (TRAVIS) speaks up -- nerves frayed:

TRAVIS
Just kill us already...
 


(CONTINUED)
 
8.

CONTINUED: (2)

LANG
Shut up, man --

TRAVIS
What? They’re animals, he’s gonna slaughter us --

Caesar slowly steps toward him... Travis falls silent.

And at last CAESAR SPEAKS, a dark edge in his voice:

CAESAR
I... did not start this war.

The humans all hold their breath, gaping up at him.

CAESAR (CONT’D)
The ape who did... is dead. His name was Koba. I killed him.
(then, harder)

I only fight now... to protect apes.

TRAVIS
(steeling himself)
Yeah?	What about him?
(glances at Red)

And we got ten more just like him.

CAESAR
I know these apes.	They followed Koba...
(looks Red dead in the eye)

They tried to kill me. They fear what I will do to them. They believe I cannot forgive. So now they serve you... just to survive.

Red glares up at Caesar -- and for the first time he unexpectedly SPEAKS in PRIMITIVE, BASTARDIZED LANGUAGE:

RED
I no fear you! You must fear! How long you think woods can protect you? Humans destroy you. Their Kerna has all power. Humans follow all he say. To them, he more than just human. He everything.

He looks over the apes, who seem chilled... his eyes boring into Winter’s; the young gorilla is unnerved --

RED (CONT’D)
He say: first Caesar die... then you all die.
 



(CONTINUED)
 
9.

CONTINUED: (3)

Spear ERUPTS, hurling Red to the ground -- when Caesar puts a hand up. Spear restrains himself, eyes still blazing. Caesar looks to Luca, then signs:

CAESAR
[Get him out of here.]

Luca turns to Winter. Winter gathers himself, then drags a resisting Red away. The humans watch, fearful... then turn to Caesar, awaiting their fate... Luca signs, ominously:

LUCA
[What should we do with them?]

CUT TO:

BOUND HUMAN WRISTS, AS APE HANDS CINCH A KNOT TIGHT --

REVEAL PREACHER, LANG, TRAVIS, AND THE OTHER TWO SOLDIERS on a pair of horses, their hands now TIED to the reins. Apes on the ground surround them. Preacher looks at Caesar.

PREACHER
You’re letting us live...?

CAESAR
Tell your Colonel... you have seen me now. And I have a message for him: this fighting can stop. Leave us the woods. And no more humans will die.

The soldiers look at him, fear and defiance in their eyes. Caesar nods to Luca -- who SWATS the horses’ hindquarters, sending them on their way. The stunned humans peer back at the apes as the horses carry them off.

TIGHT ON CAESAR AND LUCA as Maurice steps up beside them, and they WATCH THE HUMANS GO. Finally, Maurice turns to Caesar:

MAURICE
[Do you really think they’ll give him the message?]

CAESAR
They are the message. I showed them mercy. He will see we are not savages.
(then)
Let’s hope this works. They are getting closer...

Just then SHRIEKING is heard -- they turn to see --
 




(CONTINUED)
 
10.

CONTINUED:

A COMMOTION among the apes by the trenches below. Apes start to swarm up toward them. As they near, a distraught Winter is revealed in their midst, clutching his head, BLEEDING --

Alarmed, Luca moves for him -- Caesar watches, concerned, as
Winter lifts his head, signs to Luca, humiliated and upset:

WINTER
[Red attacked me!	He got away!]

Winter turns to Caesar, too ashamed to hold his gaze.

WINTER (CONT’D)
[I’m sorry...]

Caesar says nothing, taking in the troubling news; we CUT TO:

EXT. WOODS - EPIC WIDE SHOT - LATE AFTERNOON

The procession of ape warriors heads through the woods, led by Caesar on horseback. The able march with the injured, helping them keep up; the dead are carried on the backs of horses. A LOW ROAR builds as we CUT TO --

AN IMPOSING WATERFALL

RUSHING down sheer rock-face in an area nestled deep in the woods. The apes have stopped to gather along the river at the base of the falls. Shrouded ape bodies are released into the river. Caesar and Maurice sit side by side, apart from the others -- Caesar, troubled:

CAESAR
Why didn’t I see, Maurice?

Maurice turns to Caesar.

MAURICE
[See what?]

CAESAR
That Koba could not forgive what humans did to him when he was their prisoner. That he would seek revenge. I should have known.

MAURICE
[No one could have known how much darkness was living inside of him.]

A SUDDEN HIGH-PITCHED ALERT rings out, almost like a bugle. They quickly look up to --
 



(CONTINUED)
 
11.

CONTINUED:

THE TREELINE ABOVE

where we discover they are far from alone, the trees coming to life as APES EMERGE EVERYWHERE! Hundreds concealed in CAMOUFLAGED GUARD STRUCTURES in trees and all around the falls. A LONE APE blows into a RAM’S HORN, as others communicate to the apes below that someone is coming...!

The apes on the ground seize their weapons, standing at the ready, tension building to a fever-pitch when --

A SMALL GROUP OF HORSES appears through the trees...

Caesar’s intense expression suddenly changes, swelling with emotion as he sees --

BLUE EYES, ROCKET, and TWO OTHER APES arriving. They look weary, caked with dust, their horses laden with enough gear to suggest they’ve been on a long journey.

As they dismount, Caesar and a group of others move quickly to greet them. Caesar stands before Blue Eyes, the two of them just looking at each other, overcome. Everyone watches, giving them their space, when finally Blue Eyes signs:

BLUE EYES
[Hello, Father...]

A huge smile spreads across Caesar’s face and he embraces his son. The crowd celebrates, rushing in to join the reunion. Caesar turns to Rocket, the two happy to see each other --

CAESAR
Welcome home, Rocket.
(grins at Rocket)

You look tired.

ROCKET
[It was a long journey --]

BLUE EYES
(cuts in, excited)

[Father, we found something!]

Caesar looks at him, immediately hopeful.

CAESAR
Come inside!

They all start toward the waterfall -- as we CUT TO --
 
12.



THE BACK SIDE OF THE WATERFALL

DAYLIGHT plays through the ENORMOUS WALL OF RUSHING WATER, as the SILHOUETTES of Caesar and the apes appear in front of it, entering around the edge of the falls. They continue into the cavernous recess as we CUT TO REVEAL we are inside --

A HIDDEN FORTRESS

Like a primitive castle built into the caves, completely concealed behind the waterfall and surrounding rocks. A FLOOD OF CHILDREN converge around them as their MOTHERS run after them, trying to maintain a little order.

Blue Eyes looks through the crowd, spots CORNELIA rushing toward him, beaming -- he beams back --

BLUE EYES
[Mother...!]

--	she pulls him into an emotional hug. They both look down, noticing a TODDLER (CORNELIUS) hiding shyly behind her legs.

CORNELIA
[Cornelius, don’t you recognize your brother?]

Blue Eyes crouches down, strokes his head.	Cornelia grins:

CORNELIA (CONT’D)
[Someone else missed you too...]

Blue Eyes turns, rising to see -- A YOUNG, FEMALE APE around Blue Eyes’ age (LAKE) standing right behind him. Blue Eyes is struck at the very sight of her. She smiles uncertainly as he takes her hands, and they tenderly press their foreheads together.

INT. HIDDEN FORTRESS - COUNCIL ROOM - SHORT TIME LATER

CAESAR’S SYMBOL carved into the stone floor; around the symbol sit Caesar and Cornelia, Blue Eyes, Lake, Rocket, Maurice, Luca, Winter and other COUNCIL MEMBERS.

A MAP is laid out on the floor; Cornelius presses his face close, watching Blue Eyes’ finger as it points to one spot in particular:

BLUE EYES
(passionately, to Caesar)
[This is it, Father.	We can start over.

A new home.]
 



(CONTINUED)
 
13.

CONTINUED:

Cornelia scoops Cornelius into her lap, gently pulling him away from the map -- she looks at Blue Eyes, intrigued, points:

CORNELIA
[What is beyond those mountains, son?]

Blue Eyes picks up a pouch beside him and digs his hand in, removing a fistful of SAND; he spills it out dramatically --

BLUE EYES
[A desert, Rocket and I had to cross it too. The journey is long, but that is why humans will not find us.]

Cornelia smiles, nodding -- she and Caesar exchange a proud look -- when Winter cuts in anxiously:

WINTER
[We must leave tonight!]

LAKE
[Tonight?	That’s impossible!]

WINTER
[How much longer can we wait? Soldiers are getting closer!]

BLUE EYES
(touching Winter’s arm)

[Winter...]

Winter shrugs him off -- Luca and the others all erupt angrily at Winter -- Caesar stands imposingly. Winter immediately lowers his head, afraid; then, to Caesar:

WINTER
[Your son’s been gone, he doesn’t know how hard it’s been!]

BLUE EYES
[I know you are scared, we all are, but we are still planning...]

CAESAR
Yes... We must still find a way to get out of the woods safely.

Everyone looks at Caesar as he sits.

CAESAR (CONT’D)
There were two of you.	But we are many.
 



(CONTINUED)
 
14.

CONTINUED: (2)

MAURICE
(concurring)

[The woods are filled with soldiers.]

Everyone falls silent.	Blue Eyes meets Caesar’s gaze:

BLUE EYES
Father... We must try.

Caesar looks at his son, emotional:

CAESAR
I know, son.
(he turns to the others)

More apes die everyday. And we cannot hide here much longer.

Caesar looks back down at the map, deep in thought; then feels the anxious stares of the apes around him. He looks at them, trying to reassure, though he is still uncertain himself:

CAESAR (CONT’D)
We will find a way out...

He raises his fists and brings them together, solemn:

CAESAR (CONT’D)
Apes together strong.

They return the gesture, nodding faithfully at their leader.

INT. HIDDEN FORTRESS - CAESAR’S DWELLING - NIGHT

A small cave in the upper levels of the fortress, enclosed on one side by the ROARING FALLS. Caesar sits up, awake, as his family sleeps around him. Troubled, he studies Blue Eyes’ map in his lap -- when suddenly he feels something...

Caesar looks down to see Cornelius instinctively hugging his leg as he rests, nuzzled beside his mother. Caesar gazes down protectively at his little one, strokes his head, then turns to look back at the map -- when he notices Blue Eyes staring up at him through heavy lidded eyes.

BLUE EYES
[Can’t sleep?]

Caesar shakes his head, his worried gaze returning to the map. Finally, Blue Eyes reaches out and touches his father’s arm; Caesar turns.
 




(CONTINUED)
 
15.

CONTINUED:

BLUE EYES (CONT’D)
[Trust me, father. This is a risk worth taking.]

Moved, Caesar nods; he reaches out and gratefully caresses his son’s face, then SIGNS, smiling:

CAESAR
[I am so proud of you.]
(then)

[I love you, son.]

--	when suddenly a SHIMMERING GREEN LIGHT washes briefly over both their faces...

Startled, Caesar looks up at the falls to SEE --

--	THREE SHAPES distorted surreally in the water, each haloed in green light as they descend rapidly from view.

Unnerved, Caesar sits up, unsure of what he’s just seen. Blue Eyes watches as his father approaches the falls warily, moving in very close... when Caesar sees a STRANGE THIN LINE, whipping about in the current...?

He reaches toward THE LINE, mystified -- then plunges his arm deep in the water, grasping for it --

--	he pulls the line toward him... revealing a taut section of RED NYLON CLIMBING ROPE, straining against the current...

Alarmed, Caesar immediately turns back to Blue Eyes and signs, urgent:

CAESAR (CONT’D)
[Stay here. Protect your mother and brother.]

Blue Eyes nods with growing concern as Caesar heads out --

INT. DARK CATACOMB - NIGHT

We hear the INCESSANT, OMINOUS ROAR of the waterfall as THREE FIGURES enter the rock corridor, shrouded in DARKNESS...

The sweeping, green beams of THREE RIFLE’S LASER SITES blink on, one by one, as the figures sneak forward through mist. At a fork in the catacombs, one silently signals for the others to go one way; he goes the other...
 
16.



IN ANOTHER DARK CATACOMB

CAESAR creeps cautiously down the narrow, winding passage, picking up speed... He hugs the wall, rounding a bend --

--	when he comes face-to-face with A HULKING FIGURE! Caesar leaps back, startled -- then finds it’s Luca. Standing guard with a rifle, the gorilla looks surprised to see Caesar:

LUCA
[Sorry, Caesar.]

CAESAR
[How many others on patrol?]

LUCA
[Five?	Six--?]

CAESAR
[Get them!	Rocket too!]

CUT TO:

BLUE EYES

Crouched behind rocks in the family dwelling. He gestures protectively to Cornelia and the toddler to stay behind him as he anxiously stares at --

A GREEN LASER BEAM slowly approaching in the dark rock corridor just outside their cave... a HUSHED VOICE:

FEMALE SOLDIER
Lima-two to command.	Colonel, intel’s
good.	I’m in the target area.	Are you
close?

Blue Eyes tightens his grip on a SPEAR in his hand... HOLD on him, as he waits, coiled to pounce --

The green glow of the beam spills into the cave, sweeping its interior, getting closer, closer -- when --

Blue Eyes SPRINGS FORWARD! STAY ON a terrified Cornelia and the toddler as we HEAR a sudden VIOLENT SCUFFLE, chaotic flashes of green illuminating Cornelia’s horrified reaction! The space finally goes quiet, and we --

CUT WIDE TO SEE BLUE EYES IN PROFILE, standing over the body of the intruder; it’s LANG, the tattooed female soldier, her rifle on the floor a few feet away. Blue Eyes clutches his spear, catching his breath -- when --
 



(CONTINUED)
 
17.

CONTINUED:

A second OUT OF FOCUS FIGURE creeps silently into the f.g.... Blue Eyes unaware as another green beam quickly moves up his body, finally coming to rest on the back of his head...

INT. DARK, NARROW CATACOMB - MOVING SHOT - SIMULTANEOUS

Yet ANOTHER BEAM scans the pitch black passage as a FIGURE moves stealthily toward us. He WHISPERS into his headset:

SOLDIER
Lima-four to command.	Colonel, did you
get him--?

--	when suddenly A SHAPE tackles him from behind -- SMASHING the Soldier against the walls like a rag doll -- SILENCED MUZZLE FLASHES STROBING as the soldier involuntarily pulls the trigger! The space goes black again as the Soldier is dropped in a heap.

A SILENT BEAT. Then, approaching TORCHLIGHT flickers on the walls... revealing the shape to be ROCKET; he reaches down and grimly retrieves the gun from the dead soldier on the ground. Rocket looks up as Caesar and Luca arrive with the torch.

CAESAR
Rocket!	What happened?!

Rocket signs urgently to Caesar -- pointing to the body:

ROCKET
[I heard him talking! The Colonel is here!]

Caesar’s eyes go wide -- he takes the torch from Luca, moves down close to look at the body... immediately recognizing TRAVIS, the defiant soldier whose life he spared. Suddenly, an eerie crackle comes back over Travis’ headset:

THE COLONEL (V.O.)
99, target acquired!...

Caesar picks up the dislodged headset, raises it to his ear --

THE COLONEL (V.O.)
...Repeat, target is down!	I got him.
Let’s go! I can get out from here!

Caesar’s face goes ashen as horror dawns...

SMASH TO:
 
18.



A HUMAN HAND

fishing out the red nylon climbing rope from the waterfall... it starts to clip the rope to an anchor on a belt --

SMASH TO:

CAESAR

BOUNDING FULL-TILT through the corridor, faster, faster -- until he bursts into

HIS FAMILY DWELLING

Panicked, heart-racing, Caesar’s eyes FIND --

COLONEL J. WESLEY MCCULLOUGH

Silhouetted by the waterfall as he finishes securing the rope to his belt. He turns to face us -- and Caesar -- for the very first time: a striking, nightmarish image -- his face covered in shocks of dark camo grease, head completely shaved, a full unruly beard, wild eyes just visible behind graduated aviator sunglasses. His presence is chilling.

The Colonel’s eyes blaze, stunned at the sight of Caesar. Confused, his gaze flits to something on the floor -- Caesar follows his stare to discover --

BLUE EYES, LIFELESS ON THE GROUND, CORNELIA DEAD BESIDE HIM.

TIGHT ON CAESAR as time seems to stop -- he’s reeling, his entire world crashing in -- his eyes lift to the Colonel, a wave of rage rushing over him -- when --

THE COLONEL quickly swings his gun off his shoulder -- Caesar DODGES FOR COVER behind the rocks -- as -- The Colonel FIRES --

From the corridor we hear the furious ROAR OF INCOMING APES --

The Colonel yells into his headset, backing toward the falls:

THE COLONEL
Get me out!	Now!!

Then he turns -- and LEAPS STRAIGHT THROUGH THE WATERFALL! Caesar raises his head just in time to see --
 



(CONTINUED)
 
19.

CONTINUED:

THE COLONEL, barely discernible through the rushing water, clutching the swinging rope -- as HE’S PULLED UPWARD!

Apes spill into the cave as Caesar, desperate with rage, jumps to his feet, charging after the Colonel -- the apes watch in shock as -- CAESAR LUNGES INTO THE FALLS TOO -- !

EXT. WATERFALL - CONTINUOUS

Caesar crashes through the water, hands flailing for --

THE ROPE! He grabs at it -- IT CAREENS WILDLY! Caesar holds on tight, looks up to see --

THE COLONEL high above -- clinging to the suddenly jerking line -- he looks down to see

CAESAR starting to climb up furiously after him...

The Colonel, unfazed, seizes a KNIFE from his boot as -- Caesar closes in, climbing, about to reach him -- when -- THE COLONEL CUTS THE LINE -- and --

Caesar PLUMMETS -- down, down, down -- INTO THE RIVER BELOW!

An excruciating beat -- then Caesar SPRINGS UP from the water, gasping, enraged -- he peers up in agony to SEE --

THE COLONEL disappearing over the TOP OF THE CLIFF!

INT. CAESAR’S FAMILY DWELLING - LATER

CLOSE ON Cornelia and Blue Eyes, as their lifeless bodies are lifted from the rock floor...

REVEAL CAESAR watching silently, lost in his own world; still wet, he remains completely motionless, consumed with rage, pain. Beside him, Rocket, Luca and Maurice watch, shaken, as the bodies are carried away.

Just then Spear pushes through, reporting to Luca:

SPEAR
[Luca! We can’t find Winter. He wasn’t at his post.]

Luca and Maurice suddenly exchange a worried look --

MAURICE
[He was scared. Could he have turned against us?]
 


(CONTINUED)
 
20.

CONTINUED:

He looks to Rocket as well -- but Rocket’s gaze is now fixed elsewhere. Maurice and the others all turn to see --

CAESAR has been following their conversation. Finally, Luca signs, wracked with guilt:

LUCA
[Caesar... I think Winter betrayed us.

I’m sorry. He was in my command.]

Caesar remains silent; then:

CAESAR
My youngest son... Have you found him yet?

LUCA
[We’re still looking.]

Maurice turns to the others:

MAURICE
[Let’s help them search.]

Everyone nods, following Maurice’s lead as they shuffle out, giving Caesar some much-needed space... Finally --

Caesar is alone.

His eyes move to where he found Blue Eyes and Cornelia; there is blood on the floor. He steps closer, in a trance; sees --

TWO BRASS BULLET CASINGS on the ground. Caesar crouches, his expression intensifying as he reaches for the spent casings --

--	when he hears a NOISE behind him -- on a hair-trigger, Caesar seizes the spear, raising it furiously -- so gripped by animalistic rage that it takes a moment to realize -- it’s his toddler son, peeking out from hiding in the rocks; Cornelius peers up in terror at his father, shrinking back.

Caesar returns to his senses, lowers the spear... then, softening, he bends to the toddler and extends a hand... But Cornelius is still too frightened to approach, his eyes fixed on the spear in Caesar’s grasp.

Ashamed, Caesar sets the spear on the ground, then holds both arms out to his son.

CAESAR
Cornelius... you’re safe now, son.

CONTINUED: (2)

The child finally comes, reluctantly... Caesar, growing emotional, pulls him into a powerful embrace. We HOLD TIGHT on CAESAR, pain etched deeply on his face...

CUT TO:

EXT. RIVERBANK AT THE BASE OF THE WATERFALL - DAY

The entire ape community is here, urgently loading up their horses, preparing for the imminent exodus. HEADS TURN as ---

CAESAR makes his way through the crowd; clutching a rifle in one hand and holding his little son’s hand in the other, gaze fixed ahead as he crosses to --

LAKE, who stands by her horse, surrounded by Maurice, Luca, and Rocket on theirs. Caesar looks at Lake. He seems stoic, but his eyes belie heartbreak, and something deeper... tremendous rage:

CAESAR
You loved my son. Look after his brother until I return.

LAKE
(stunned)

[You’re not coming with us?]

CAESAR
No.

Caesar crouches down to Cornelius, caresses his little son one last time, then guides him to Lake.

ANGLE ON Rocket and Luca; they exchange a look, shocked.

Maurice looms behind them on horseback, watching it all too:

MAURICE
[Caesar!	You’re not going after them?!]

CAESAR
Not them...	Him.

MAURICE
[Caesar, you are our leader! We can’t leave without you!]

CAESAR
You must. The soldiers will be back soon.
 




(CONTINUED)
 
22.

CONTINUED:

Caesar looks for one last time at his son -- Cornelius cries out as Lake tries to comfort him --

CORNELIUS
[Father!]

But Caesar remains unrelenting, already completely consumed by his dark, vengeful quest as he starts to head off:

CAESAR
(to the apes around him)

When I find him, the soldiers will all come after me. That may give you the best chance to get out of the woods. Until then, be safe.

And with that he moves straight for his horse. As the reality that their leader is leaving them sets in, the ape community begins to react in anxious protest -- shockwaves of HOOTS rise as Caesar mounts his horse.

ON MAURICE, ROCKET AND LUCA watching Caesar amidst the growing turmoil -- they stare after him in total disbelief...

EXT. WIDE SHOT ON THE APE EXODUS - WOODS - DAY

A seemingly endless line of ape refugees. Spear leads the procession; armed apes in warpaint guard the group, parents protectively clutching their children, others help the injured along -- as they set off uncertainly for the perilous journey ahead...

EXT. WOODS - DAY

Caesar rides alone, rifle in hand, the sound of the ape exodus now barely audible in the distance. Suddenly, he hears RUSTLING behind him. He turns, stops, alert. As the sound gets closer, we recognize the CLOP OF HOOVES -- then --

MAURICE, ROCKET, and LUCA appear, riding out of the trees. They come to a halt, eyes on Caesar. Caesar returns a hard look, shakes his head. But Luca is undeterred:

LUCA
[The soldiers’ camp is always moving. My guards think they know where it is. Let me take you.]

ROCKET
[You’ll need me to back you up.]

Rocket reveals a rifle in his hand.	But Caesar remains firm:
 



(CONTINUED)
 
23.

CONTINUED:

CAESAR
No.

ROCKET
[Please... I know what it’s like... to lose a son.]

That strikes a chord; Caesar looks at him, affected...

CAESAR
I might not make it back.

MAURICE
[That’s why I’m coming. To make sure you do.]

Caesar looks at his three friends, moved, torn...

CUT TO:

A MOVING SHOT - CAESAR, MAURICE, ROCKET AND LUCA

Riding silently through woods, close together. A posse. HOLD on this iconic image of the foursome; then CUT TO --

EXT. LOWER WOODS - SEASIDE CLIFF - LATER

The posse making their descent, when they see --

SMOKE rising from an old shack across the way.

They look at each other, slowing...

LUCA
[This is where the guards thought they might be. There are always fires burning.]

CUT TO:

HANDHELD SHOT - PEEKING THROUGH THE TREES

As we move closer, we discover we are at the edge of --

A DESERTED R.V. PARK

Old campers lined up, long-since abandoned. Smoke billows from a weathered stovepipe poking through the window of a rusted-out Airstream trailer. The only sign of life.

REVERSE ON CAESAR, MAURICE, ROCKET AND LUCA

spying through the trees on foot, looking apprehensive. They exchange uncertain looks -- could this be the base camp? They creep out of the trees for a closer look -- when --

A LONE MAN carrying firewood emerges from the forest.

He’s mid-40s, dirty, unshaven. Seeing the apes, he stops in his tracks. They all stare, a silent stand-off... Then, very, very slowly, he starts to lower his pile of wood
