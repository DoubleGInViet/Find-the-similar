MAN
I’m just gonna... put this down --

He drops the wood suddenly, revealing a RIFLE strapped to his shoulder -- he whips it around -- and FIRES! The shot JUST MISSES MAURICE, when --

BANG!	THE MAN DROPS DEAD.	Stunned, the apes turn to see --

CAESAR clutching his SMOKING GUN, staring distantly at the man he’s just killed. The others regard Caesar’s grim, steady presence, a bit in shock at his seeming lack of remorse; a look in his eyes suggests even he knows something has broken within him. A line has been crossed.

Finally, Caesar lowers his rifle -- only now aware of their stares. He turns away, ignoring them, steps toward the man.

The others join him, looking down at the body. The tattered rags he wears are barely recognizable as the fatigues worn by the human soldiers. “AΩΩ” is crudely tattooed on his arm.

LUCA
[Is he out here alone?]

ROCKET
[Maybe he’s a deserter?]

Caesar doesn’t respond, eyes on the dead man -- when a MUTED CRASH comes from behind; they all turn to THE AIRSTREAM...

CUT TO:

BLACKNESS

Suddenly a door is ripped open, and light spills in; we are --

INT. RUSTED-OUT AIRSTREAM - DOORWAY - MOMENTS LATER

The faces of the apes slowly appear, gazing warily in at us; Caesar and Rocket have their guns drawn.
 


(CONTINUED)
 
25.

CONTINUED:

They stalk silently into the dim space, eyes roaming... It’s long and narrow, lined with rotted wood panelling, packed and littered with improvised survivalist essentials.

We MOVE with them as Caesar leads the group through the claustrophobic interior, anxiously scanning for any place a human might be hiding... Moving inexorably toward...

A CLOSED DOOR

at the far end of the trailer. The others exchange tense looks as Caesar readies his gun -- and SMASHES down the door!

ON CAESAR, eyes blazing, furiously training his gun as he sees something; he freezes, poised to kill, and we REVEAL --

A LITTLE GIRL

cowering like a frightened animal against the wall in a lower bunk bed. She looks no more than 8 or 9 years old. A little waif-like figure, her unwashed face is framed by wildly matted hair. She stares wide-eyed up at --

Caesar, gun still trained on her, adrenaline coursing through his veins... The faces of the other apes appear behind him, shocked at what they see.

Finally, Maurice reaches over, places a hand on Caesar’s gun, gently lowers it. Caesar returns to his senses... but still shows no compassion for the human child. He turns away, to the others, gesturing coldly at the trailer behind them:

CAESAR
Look around.	Take what we can use.

Caesar steps out past them; Rocket and Luca share an uneasy look, then follow.

But Maurice remains, eyeing the scared little Girl with a mixture of curiosity and pity. He spots something on the floor by the bed, starts to move toward it...

Terrified, the Girl scoots back against the wall, withdrawing as far as she can. But Maurice coos a comforting pant-hoot as he reaches down to the floor and retrieves --

A CRUDELY-MADE RAG DOLL. He holds it out. She hesitates -- then quickly grabs it and retreats to her corner, hugging it.

Maurice watches her, then raises his arm, reaching for her. She freezes, nervous eyes following his enormous hand... as his finger straightens... and gently strokes the doll’s head.
 



(CONTINUED)
 
26.

CONTINUED: (2)

She blinks up, studying him, fear ebbing; she opens her mouth to speak, but no words come, just GENTLE, GASPING GRUNTS...

CUT TO:

A DUSTY COMPASS IN A BATTERED OLD LOCKBOX

REVEAL LUCA picking it up, as he, Caesar and Rocket search the trailer. Luca sees a PAIR OF BINOCULARS in the box; he takes them too, along with some FLASHLIGHTS.

Impatient, Caesar looks back, wondering where Maurice is -- when Maurice appears in the doorway, the Girl visible behind him, staring out curiously. Maurice signs to Caesar:

MAURICE
[Something wrong with her. I don’t think she can speak.]

Caesar looks coldly at the Girl, then back to Maurice:

CAESAR
Come.

EXT. DESERTED R.V. PARK - LATE AFTERNOON

Caesar and Rocket mount their horses as Luca arrives with the others. Maurice is about to climb up when he notices --

The Girl has followed them out. She wanders toward the dead Man, his gun still a few feet away. She stares at him, looking lost, but not quite sad. Instead she exhibits a strange, almost primitive fascination with his lifeless body.

They all gaze at her, uncertain.	Maurice turns to Caesar:

MAURICE
[She’ll die out here alone.]

Caesar looks at her, a flash of pity in his eyes... but he pushes it away, turns to Maurice, firm:

CAESAR
We cannot take her.

Maurice considers this, nods.

MAURICE
[I understand...]
(then:)

[But I cannot leave her.]

Caesar stares at him, frustrated...
 
27.



EXT. WOODS - DUSK

The posse on the move again. The Girl rides behind Maurice, arms around him, her cheek pressed into his furry back. Caesar takes in the sight, shoots Maurice a hard look... Maurice returns an assuring nod: it’ll be okay.

Just then, Luca GRUNTS for their attention. They all turn to see CROSSES UP AHEAD ON THE SIDE OF THE TRAIL, crudely-bound branches staked into the ground. They approach warily, stopping as they discover --

A LARGE GRAVEYARD amidst the trees. A sea of crosses, marking mounds of dirt. They peer around, a bit unnerved:

MAURICE
[Must be where they bury the dead.]

Rocket nods, when Caesar suddenly notices the TREE TRUNKS are scarred with BULLET HOLES... He glances at the ground, finding scattered BRASS BULLET CASINGS; perplexed, he points:

CAESAR
Looks like some were killed here.

They all look at the shot-up trees and casings, bewildered -- when Luca sees a pile of ASHES and CHARRED OBJECTS -- BLACKENED EYEGLASSES, BELT BUCKLES, DOG TAGS --

LUCA
[They burned their things too.]

MAURICE
[Why would they kill their own men?]

ON CAESAR, mulling the mystery -- when Luca lets out another
GRUNT; they turn as he points through the trees at pinpricks
of FIRE LIGHT and TENTS in the distance.	It’s the base camp.

Caesar tenses in grim anticipation --

CUT TO:

A POV THROUGH HIGH-POWERED BINOCULARS

SEARCHING the FIELD OF TENTS in the blue twilight. We FIND a huge “AΩΩ” stencilled on the side of one of them. Re-focus on HAND-PAINTED SIGNAGE beside it: “Those who forget the past are doomed to repeat it.” Next to it: “The only good Kong is a dead Kong.” An eerie, almost cult-like atmosphere.
 
28.



REVEAL CAESAR

crouched in brush, spying through the binoculars scavenged from the Airstream. Luca and Rocket are pressed beside him.

CAESAR’S POV

A PAIR OF TURNCOAT APES walk into view -- the binoculars follow them as they cross to an area where LARGE GROUPS OF SOLDIERS are gathered around CAMP FIRES; as the apes begin dutifully pouring drink into the humans’ cups, one turns toward us -- we recognize him as RED.

The apes watch Caesar peering; when suddenly his expression hardens. He slowly lowers the glasses, anger burning...

LUCA
[Did you find the Colonel...?]

Caesar just hands the binoculars to Luca, who lifts them --

LUCA’S POV THROUGH BINOCULARS

Beside Red, the OTHER APE HAS TURNED TOWARD US, serving the humans... As Luca FOCUSES, we recognize him, as Caesar whispers his name ominously:

CAESAR
Winter...

EXT. CAMPFIRE - NIGHT

We’re inside the human camp now. Red and Winter quietly ladle stew from a bucket to Soldiers sitting around the fire.

A volatile soldier with tortured eyes (BOYLE) calls out in a low, menacing voice to Winter:

BOYLE
Donkey.	Over here.

Winter hesitates, flustered -- Red notices, immediately intercedes, anxiously trying to placate Boyle --

RED
Ok -- Ok...	He come...

He nods at Winter to hurry over; he does. Boyle holds out his bowl. Winter takes it, filling it quickly -- some stew spills on Boyle’s boot --

BOYLE
Hey!	Hey!	You stupid-- !
 


(CONTINUED)
 
29.

CONTINUED:

WHAP! as Boyle KICKS the bowl right out of Winter’s hand -- and Winter reacts with an instinctive SNARL! Boyle grabs his gun, points it right at him. Winter FREEZES -- then:

A VOICE (O.S.)
Come on, Boyle...

Boyle turns to see PREACHER, the fresh-faced kid, beside him.

BOYLE
Shut up, Preacher -- what’re you, a donkey lover now? I think you going soft coz that kong let you go.

Some of the soldiers snicker. Preacher backs down, humiliated and angry. Boyle levels his gun at Winter again.

BOYLE (CONT’D)
Get me a new bowl.

Winter looks nervously to Red.	Red nods soberly: do it.

INT. DARKENED MOBILE KITCHEN TENT - MOMENTS LATER

Winter digs under a supply table for a new bowl. Rising, he catches his reflection in a grimy mirror over a wash basin. He hesitates, maybe suffering a crisis of conscience -- when he sees A REFLECTED FACE lurking in the shadows behind him!

He spins to see CAESAR standing there, motionless, staring...

Panicked, Winter turns for the exit -- but LUCA is there, blocking escape. Turns the other way -- and there’s ROCKET. Winter’s eyes widen as Caesar takes a slow step toward him...

CAESAR
Where is the Colonel?

Winter swallows, trembling as he lifts his hands to sign:

WINTER
[He’s gone.]

CAESAR
(dubious, stalking closer)

...Gone?

Winter looks at the other apes, sees them closing in too...
Turns back to Caesar, nervously explaining:

WINTER
[This morning. He took many soldiers with him.]
 


(CONTINUED)
 
30.

CONTINUED:

Luca and Rocket exchange troubled glances... but Caesar’s eyes remain fixed on Winter as he continues his approach...

WINTER (CONT’D)
[Men are coming down here –- from their base in the north. The Colonel and his soldiers are going to meet them at the border.]

CAESAR
What border?	Why?

WINTER
[I don’t know. But more of us are leaving to join them in the morning. Red thinks they’ll all be coming back here...
to help the Colonel finish off the apes for good.]

Caesar finally stops, right in front of him.	Winter pleads:

WINTER (CONT’D)
[Please... I know I betrayed you. But can’t you see? We’ll never beat them. I was just trying to survive. Red told me the humans promised to spare us if we helped. I beg you, forgive me...]

But Caesar is unmoved, barely stifling his rage...

CAESAR
My son... my wife... are dead.

Just then -- we hear the LAUGHTER OF HUMANS outside; Winter turns, sees SHADOWS OF SOLDIERS passing on the side of the tent -- he opens his mouth to shriek to them -- but a HAND CLAMPS over his mouth, as Caesar wrestles him to the ground to silence him! The others rush in, holding Winter down as he struggles violently, desperately trying to shriek out --

The SHADOWS OF THE SOLDIERS HALT, their laughter subsiding as their heads turn toward the muffled sounds in the tent --

Seeing this, Caesar furiously tightens his grip around Winter’s neck -- but Winter won’t stop, struggling even harder! Eyes fixed on the human shadows, Caesar grips fiercely... choking tighter and tighter...

...until Winter finally relents. Caesar watches the shadows, tense... And at last, they move on.

The apes exhale relief. Luca and Rocket turn to Caesar -- but their eyes drift to Winter.
 


(CONTINUED)
 
31.

CONTINUED: (2)

Caesar follows their looks down to the young gorilla in his grasp... and discovers he has killed him.

Stunned, he stares at Winter’s lifeless face... then, slowly, looks up again at Luca and Rocket, grappling with what he’s done. They lower their eyes.

EXT. DENSE WOODS - NIGHT

Tense silence. The apes and Girl sit by a fire, isolated in the trees; Maurice studies Caesar’s face as he gazes into the flames, deeply unsettled. Then Maurice turns to the others, who look equally plagued. Finally, Rocket turns to Maurice:

ROCKET
[Winter had it coming!]

Maurice nods, uneasy; Luca looks up, convincing himself:

LUCA
[Caesar had no choice!]

MAURICE
[So what do we do now?]

ROCKET
[Wait for the soldiers to leave. Follow them to the Colonel.]

Maurice turns again to Caesar, who is still in his own world, lifting a gourd canteen to his lips. He takes a drink...

when, out of the corner of his eye, he sees the Girl beside him, staring at him guilelessly.

He looks at her askance for a moment, deadpan, then hands her the gourd, and she guzzles thirstily. Caesar watches --

--	when suddenly his eyes shift, startled to discover a DARK FIGURE on the other side of the fire...

Alarmed and bewildered, Caesar peers through the flames... amazed to see it’s AN APE sitting across from him, his head lowered ominously. Fire dances on Caesar’s pupils as he stares at the figure, haunted...

...when suddenly, the Ape lifts his face, grinning at Caesar through the distorting waves of heat -- Caesar looks haunted:

CAESAR
...Koba?

KOBA
Ape... not kill ape...
 
32.



TIGHT ON CAESAR

snapping awake with a start -- we are --

EXT. WOODS - MORNING

Caesar catches his breath, lying disoriented on the ground... when he hears activity around him. He turns, finding Maurice standing over him -- he signs urgently:

MAURICE
[The soldiers are going!]

Caesar turns to see Rocket and Luca twenty feet away, crouching anxiously behind the trees, peering into the distance -- we hear the APPROACHING THUNDER of horses...

EXT. EDGE OF WOODS - MT. TAMALPAIS - DAY

A grand vista of Mill Valley in the distance. A SMALL ARMY OF HUMANS ON HORSEBACK DESCENDS on the hills below us... when OUR POSSE arrives in the foreground.

Caesar looks with determination down at the humans as they recede... He urges his horse forward; the others follow...

AND WE DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. SIERRA MOUNTAINS - DAY

WINDS BLAST SNOW in all directions...

SMASH TO:

A WHITEOUT

Our posse are no more than DIM SHAPES pressing blindly toward us, battling the elements, lost...

TIGHT ON CAESAR’S EYES squinting hard, fighting to see...

He peers into the maelstrom spying -- BRAKE LIGHTS up ahead --

CAESAR
[Is that them up ahead?]

ROCKET
(tense)

[Looks like they stopped!]

Caesar urgently raises his hand to stop his posse --
 




(CONTINUED)
 
33.

CONTINUED:

CAESAR
[Don’t let them see us!]

He is already off his horse -- when DISTANT GUN BLASTS echo through the air! They all rush to the side of the road, huddling together -- as MORE SHOTS RING OUT up ahead --

ROCKET
(to Caesar)

[What are they shooting at?!]

CAESAR
I don’t know...

CUT TO:

A SILENT, UTTERLY STILL, SNOW-COVERED TRAIL - LATER

The blizzard has stopped.

With a SOFT CRUNCH of snow, we see our posse ride cautiously into view, eyes anxiously scanning the trail for the presence of the humans... Rocket SIGNS cautiously to the group --

ROCKET
[They’re gone...]

As he approaches, Caesar sees something -- he stops his horse:

CAESAR
(unnerved)

What is that...?

As Caesar and the others dismount, REVEAL SMALL WOODEN X ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD; they move toward the Xs to discover --

THREE BODIES DRAPED IN SNOW. Maurice tucks the Girl protectively behind him, as Caesar reaches down and brushes snow off them... revealing THREE ALPHA OMEGA SOLDIERS, bullet wounds in their backs, HOODS OVER HEADS, execution-style.

Caesar pulls one of the hoods off -- the soldier is a WOMAN; her eyes are open, lifeless, dried blood under her nostrils. Rocket pulls off another hood... a lanky, young, MALE SOLDIER, eyes shut. He too has dried blood under his nose.

Rocket inches closer to look at his face -- when THE SOLDIER’S EYES SNAP OPEN -- he GASPS at the sight of them!

The apes are startled as the panicked Soldier begins frantically scrambling away -- Caesar moves after him -- places a hand firmly on his leg --
 


(CONTINUED)
 
34.

CONTINUED:

CAESAR (CONT’D)
Why... did they shoot you?

He just stares back, blinking without understanding -- when he notices the Girl, staring at him from behind Maurice. The two lock eyes warily, like creatures in the wild. And then the Soldier opens his mouth as if trying to speak... but makes no sound, only GASPING GRUNTS, just like the Girl’s...

MAURICE
(struck; to Caesar)

[He can not speak either...?]

The apes all exchange looks; Caesar turns to Rocket:

CAESAR
Help me get him up...

Rocket reaches down toward the Soldier -- but the Soldier freaks, wide eyes darting ferally, wildly scrambling on his back to get away from them -- Caesar moves toward him, trying to calm him -- but it only spooks him more -- he rolls on to his knees and takes off RUNNING...

The apes watch, stunned, as he disappears into the woods.
Finally, Caesar turns back, looking at the bodies again...

and then the Girl.	Maurice catches his eye:

MAURICE
[What is wrong with them...?]

Caesar just shakes his head: I don’t know...	And we CUT TO:

ATOP A TALL RADIO TOWER - LATE AFTERNOON

Caesar, Maurice, Rocket, and Luca urgently climb into view as snow swirls around them; cold, out of breath, they anxiously scan the colossal Sierra snowscape, stretching out endlessly around them --

MAURICE
[Where could they have gone?!]

CAESAR
Winter said they were heading to a border...!

LUCA
[Yes, but which way is that?!]
 
35.



ON THE GROUND

The Girl sits on Maurice’s horse, craning her neck all the way back to stare up at the apes high above; as she glances back down to play with the rag doll in her hands -- an OUT OF FOCUS FIGURE IN A GREEN PARKA silently passes behind her...

CLOSE ON DARK, WEATHERED SNOW BOOTS creeping up and stopping next to the legs of one of the horses --

We watch THE BACK OF THE FIGURE’S HEAD, covered beneath the FUR-LINED HOOD of the bulky parka, as his unseen hands rummage stealthily through a saddle-bag. His breath steams quietly around him. He FREEZES as A FLASHLIGHT drops into the snow by his boots --

But the Girl remains focused on her doll, unaware.

The Figure resumes rummaging, finally pausing as we BRIEFLY GLIMPSE the BARREL OF A SHOTGUN he has just found --

UP IN THE TREE TOPS

A NERVOUS SNORT comes from one of the horses below -- the apes turn to see the TINY FIGURE IN THE BULKY PARKA FAR BELOW digging in the saddle bag; Luca lets out a TERRIFYING ROAR --

The Girl finally looks up, startled, as --

-- the Figure panics, JUMPING ON THE HORSE, AND TAKING OFF!

Caesar and his posse scramble down from the trees -- mount their horses --

SMASH TO:

THE POSSE GIVING CHASE THROUGH THE SNOWY WOODS

GALLOPING THROUGH THE TREACHEROUS OBSTACLE COURSE OF TREES -- The TINY FIGURE in the parka darts in and out of view --

The apes are starting to gain on him, when he BREAKS OUT of the woods and up onto --

A MASSIVE SNOW-COVERED SLOPE

We watch from HIGH ABOVE as his horse CHARGES THE INCLINE, KICKING POWDER INTO THE AIR -- the apes’ horses burst out of the woods after him -- all of them just tiny dots climbing the stark white landscape...
 




(CONTINUED)
 
36.

CONTINUED:

From this vantage we can now see the TOPPLED CABLES and DILAPIDATED GONDOLAS that tell us this was once A SKI AREA --

The apes again begin to close the gap --

CLOSE ON CAESAR CHARGING HARD, EYES FIXED ON --

THE DIM FIGURE up ahead of him -- when suddenly -- BLAM! -- a FLASH OF GUNFIRE ERUPTS from atop the Figure’s horse --

CAESAR and the OTHERS DUCK as -- CHING! -- the BLAST RICOCHETS off a half-buried GONDOLA CAR far wide of them!

BLAM! BLAM! TWO MORE SHOTS ring out, wildly astray, kicking up snow clouds nowhere near them or their horses --

--	as the Figure disappears over the crest of the slope.

EXT. TOP OF THE SLOPE - MOMENTS LATER

The apes arrive, slowing their horses as they come upon --

AN ENORMOUS, ABANDONED VICTORIAN HOTEL, built into the mountainside. An old sign reads: The Inn at Deer Creek.

The stolen horse wanders rider-less on the snowy front lawn.

The apes cautiously dismount, drawing their weapons... As they approach, a SHADOW SUDDENLY BOLTS from behind one of the buildings, dashing into the main lodge --

The apes all exchange looks; then raise their guns as we --

CUT TO:

INT. THE INN AT DEER CREEK - MAIN LOBBY ENTRANCE - DUSK

An ornate glass door slowly opens... Caesar, Rocket, and Luca enter, guns first... As they pass us, the door swings shut behind them... HOLD as Maurice and the Girl wait outside, pressing their faces to THE FROSTY DOOR PANE -- their eyes fill with a sense of amazement as we CUT TO:

MAURICE AND GIRL’S POV - PUSHING IN ON THE FROSTY DOOR PANE

Inside the lobby, Caesar, Rocket, and Luca creep away from us into what appears to be a kind of SURREAL ICE PALACE...

BACK INSIDE THE LOBBY

We MOVE with Caesar and the others, their breath steaming in the cold as they peer around them at an extraordinary sight --
 



(CONTINUED)
 
37.

CONTINUED:

Every inch of the cavernous interior -- from furnishings to chandeliers -- is covered in THICK CRYSTALLINE ICE, the building having long-since been breached by weather. Snow swirls in the air, drifting down through a hole in the roof.

Caesar lifts a hand to stop the others as he spots -- BOOT PRINTS in the frost on the floor. The apes’ eyes follow them across the lobby’s expanse... to where they disappear into the black opening of AN ENORMOUS HEARTH along the wall.

The apes cautiously close in, guns trained on the hearth, deep and dark enough to conceal whoever’s hiding inside...

Caesar stops at the opening; he COCKS his gun LOUDLY, levelling it -- Rocket and Luca COCK their weapons too...

... when suddenly, the STOLEN SHOTGUN is tossed out at them, landing at the apes’ feet with a thud. They stare down at it uneasily -- when to their surprise the STOLEN BINOCULARS come skittering out too. And then the COMPASS.

The apes exchange a look -- Rocket quickly grabs the shotgun, and the apes wait expectantly, weapons still raised, as --

THE FIGURE slowly begins to emerge from the darkness, head hung remorsefully, still obscured in the hood of the worn-out parka... He starts to raise his hands in surrender, and as his head lifts... we discover --

HE IS AN APE.

A chimp with more skin than hair on his small, rounded head, he has oversized ears and a little scruff of beard, his scrawny frame swimming in the big green parka.

He stares up at our shocked trio with a sheepish, apologetic smile... and finally, he SPEAKS ALOUD in halting grunts, pointing a finger at his own chest --

SCRAWNY CHIMP
(chastising himself)

Bad... ape...	Bad ape...

Our three apes just gape back, no idea what to make of him...
Rocket lowers his gun.	Then signs:

ROCKET
[Who are you?]

But Bad Ape just tilts his head, not comprehending. Our apes exchange uncertain looks. Then Luca turns to Bad Ape, leery:
 




(CONTINUED)
 
38.

CONTINUED: (2)

LUCA
[Where are you from?]

No answer.	Luca turns to Caesar.

LUCA (CONT’D)
[I don’t think he understands.]

ROCKET
(to Caesar)

[I don’t recognize him. He’s not one of us.]

Caesar regards the odd little chimp a moment; then SPEAKS:

CAESAR
Are you... alone here?

Bad Ape’s eyes dart uneasily from face to face -- it’s not clear if he understands this either -- but then he looks back at Caesar... and NODS.

A soft CREAKING across the lobby causes their heads to turn --

MAURICE AND THE GIRL

stand just inside the entrance, peering back uncertainly at them across the giant space.

Bad Ape notices the Girl, SHIVERING BADLY beside Maurice. Bad Ape considers her a moment, then lowers his hands --

Rocket lifts his weapon again, wary -- but Bad Ape just continues, removing his parka; finally he holds it out in one hand -- calls out to the Girl --

BAD APE
Cold...?

No one says anything. Bad Ape turns to Caesar. Holds out the parka, gesturing to the Girl with a tentative smile:

BAD APE (CONT’D)
Cold.

Caesar stares hesitantly at Bad Ape and the ratty jacket.
Finally, he reaches out, accepts it from Bad Ape’s fingers.

CUT TO:

AROUND THE HEARTH - A SHORT TIME LATER

as Bad Ape starts A FIRE.
 


(CONTINUED)
 
39.

CONTINUED:

Warming herself by the flames, the Girl -- now in Bad Ape’s parka -- sits with Caesar and the others, looking around in wonder at SPRAWLING PILES OF BAD APE’S SCAVENGED TREASURES beside the hearth, a hoarder’s paradise of dry goods, canned food, and an endless array of STOLEN ITEMS and TRINKETS.

Bad Ape beams as he stokes the flames for his new guests:

BAD APE
I see girl. Think... you human. But you... apes. Like me!

He smiles excitedly -- when he sees the Girl picking up a trinket from a pile: a glinting CHEVY NOVA CAR EMBLEM. He gently snatches it from her, kindly shakes his head no.

CAESAR
(peering around)

You... live here?

BAD APE
(nodding quickly)

Long time.	Long, long time.

He suddenly scurries away; puzzled, Caesar watches him as he
rummages through what looks like a little sleeping area.	He
returns with a small STUFFED CROCODILE, hands it to Caesar --

BAD APE (CONT’D)
(a wistful look)

Home.	Old home.

Confused, Caesar looks down at the stuffed crocodile, finds embroidered on its belly: WORLD FAMOUS SIERRA ZOO.

Caesar peers up at him, trying to make sense of this... then:

CAESAR
Are there more like you?	More apes?
From zoo?

BAD APE
(shakes head)

Dead.	All dead.	Long time.

He looks at Caesar, growing solemn as he explains:

BAD APE (CONT’D)
Humans get sick... Apes get smart...

Caesar nods, understanding he means the Simian Flu --
 




(CONTINUED)
 
40.

CONTINUED: (2)

BAD APE (CONT’D)
Then humans kill apes.	But not me...
(grins, proud)

Not me.	I run.

CAESAR
You learn to speak...?

BAD APE
(nods)

Listen to human...

His face abruptly contorts into an “angry human” expression -- he waves a chiding finger as he mimics:

BAD APE (CONT’D)
“Bad ape!	Bad ape!”

Then, turning his head, he realizes the Girl has the shiny
Chevy Nova emblem again -- he reaches for it, possessive:

BAD APE (CONT’D)
(gently admonishes)

No... No touch.

She stares at it longingly as he sets it down.	He looks back
at the apes, smiles -- then rushes away for something else...

The apes all watch their excitable host, perplexed -- Maurice turns to Caesar, signs an aside:

MAURICE
[Amazing... Always thought we were the only ones. Wonder if there are others out there somewhere? Others like us.]

Just as Caesar begins to contemplate the mind-blowing thought, Bad Ape bounds back in, hurriedly passing out packages of vacuum-foiled food rations (M.R.E.’s).

BAD APE
Here!	Eat, eat!
(beaming)

New friends.	Special day.

Bad Ape tears the top off one, starts eating the dehydrated food, nodding encouragingly for them to do the same.

Caesar looks slowly down at the ration in his hand -- notices an official military seal: “U.S. GOVERNMENT PROPERTY: CA STATE BORDER QUARANTINE DETENTION AND RELOCATION CENTER” CUT TIGHTER on the word: BORDER. Caesar suddenly looks up:
 



(CONTINUED)
 
41.

CONTINUED: (3)

CAESAR
Where did you get this?

Bad Ape turns to him, confused.	Caesar holds up the package.
Bad Ape looks uneasy... his voice lowering to a hush:

BAD APE
Bad place. Very bad. I find. Long time ago. After zoo. Looking for food. Find human zoo. Zoo for sick.

Engrossed, Caesar’s eyes meet his... as Bad Ape continues:

BAD APE (CONT’D)
Big walls. Sick humans try climb. Bad humans kill. Then get sick too. All dead now. All dead.

Caesar and the others take this in, somehow haunted.	Then:

CAESAR
Bad humans...?	Soldiers?

Bad Ape recognizes the word, nods gravely:

BAD APE
Soldiers.

The posse looks to each other with rising intensity...

ROCKET
[An old, deserted military camp on the border...?]

LUCA
[Maybe this is where the Colonel and the troops from the north are going to meet?]

Caesar nods: maybe.	He turns back to Bad Ape.

CAESAR
Is it far?	Can you take us?

BAD APE
(looks agog)
Human zoo?!	No... No go back there.
Everyone dead.	I come here.	Safe here.

Never go back!

Caesar reaches out his hand, places it on Bad Ape’s shoulder:

CAESAR
Please.	You must take us.
 


(CONTINUED)
 
42.

CONTINUED: (4)

BAD APE
No!	Can not take!	Can not take!

Scared, he pushes Caesar’s hand from his shoulder, a little too hard -- Rocket GRABS him, incensed –- but Caesar restrains Rocket, shakes his head no. Bad Ape shrinks in Rocket’s grasp -- then sees something, and points desperately to the little windows along the wall --

BAD APE (CONT’D)
Look! More snow! Can not go, must stay here.
(to the others)

Look, look!

They all look to the massive lobby window to see it is indeed snowing hard now.

Rocket finally releases Bad Ape. He exhales, looks at them with renewed optimism.

BAD APE (CONT’D)
You stay here.	Eat.	Rest.
(smiles hopefully)

With me.

Caesar considers, reluctantly nods to the others. Bad Ape is relieved -- when he sees the Girl staring longingly again at the Nova emblem; he grabs it, hands it to her ceremoniously:

BAD APE (CONT’D)
Here.	You keep.

He looks around, smiling at the apes for approval; the Girl gazes happily at the emblem, as with a WHISTLING HOWL, we --

CUT TO:

HIGH OVER THE CAVERNOUS LOBBY - MIDDLE OF NIGHT

Snow whirling hard through the ice palace.	HOLD; CUT TO:

NEAR THE HEARTH - SAME

The last embers of the fire dying out as everyone sleeps...

CLOSE ON CAESAR

The only one still awake.	He sits up, eyes settling on --

THE GIRL, curled into Maurice’s belly, hugging her doll; the Nova emblem is clutched in her little fingers. Maurice’s arm is draped protectively around her as they sleep.
 


(CONTINUED)
 
43.

CONTINUED:

Caesar stares at the sight, growing sad, his mind distant...

BAD APE (O.S.)
Who is...?

Caesar turns, startled to find Bad Ape watching him; Bad Ape nods toward the Girl.

BAD APE (CONT’D)
Child.

CAESAR
(a beat)

I don’t know.

BAD APE
(confused)

But she... with you?

Caesar nods.

CAESAR
She has no one else.

Bad Ape gazes at the Girl, suddenly feeling sorry for her.

BAD APE
I see you look at her.	Just now.
(turns back to Caesar)

Look sad.

But Caesar says nothing.	Bad Ape studies him; then ventures:

BAD APE (CONT’D)
You... have child?

Caesar turns -- Bad Ape smiles sweetly, expectantly... but Caesar just returns a withering look. Bad Ape falls silent. Caesar looks away. Then, quietly, stoically:

CAESAR
I had two. But one was killed. By human.

BAD APE
(quietly struck)

Oh...	Soldier?

Caesar, still not looking at him, NODS.	A silent beat, as
Bad Ape looks down, pensive.	Then softly:

BAD APE (CONT’D)
I had child...
 


(CONTINUED)
 
44.

CONTINUED: (2)

Caesar turns, surprised. Bad Ape stares at the ground, remembering, a little lost. Then slowly, he looks up.

BAD APE (CONT’D)
You think... you will find him... at human zoo? Soldier?

Caesar’s eyes drift to the dying embers.

CAESAR
I don’t know...	Maybe.

Bad Ape ponders this.	Torn, he finally looks at Caesar:

BAD APE
Then... maybe I take you.

Caesar turns from the fire, their eyes meeting as we CUT TO:

EXT. FRONT OF THE INN - MORNING

The Girl steps out alone onto the deserted porch, still wearing Bad Ape’s parka. As she clutches herself against the cold, something catches her eye; she looks up overhead at the PINK FLOWERS of a perennial dogwood tree, poking through the snow -- the only color in an otherwise stark white world.

With the muffled crunch of hooves, Luca and Rocket appear, guiding the four horses toward the porch.

Luca notices the Girl staring up at the branch of flowers.

He watches a moment, then moves toward her... and reaches his long arm up, snapping off a small piece of the branch.

The Girl observes as Luca bends down, his massive gorilla face right in front of hers as he very gently slips the flowers behind her ear. She smiles. He blinks back at her sweetly, when --

Caesar and Maurice emerge onto the porch. Luca quickly straightens, resuming his tough guy demeanor.

Maurice lowers next to the Girl, and she hops on his back. He moves to his horse, and climbs up with her. Caesar, Rocket and Luca mount up as well, when --

--	the front door SQUEAKS open; they turn to see Bad Ape stepping out to join them. He wears boots, an old wool blanket on his shoulders, and a striped toque on his head.
 





(CONTINUED)
 
45.

CONTINUED:

Caesar and the others stare at him, deadpan, but he is oblivious, looking from horse to horse, wondering where he’s supposed to go.

Luca GRUNTS gruffly, points him toward Rocket’s horse. Bad Ape smiles, and starts for Rocket’s horse.

Rocket looks miserable as Bad Ape struggles to climb up.

EXT. SIERRA MOUNTAINS - DAY

The group silently weaves its way through snow-covered trees.

The Girl watches curiously as Caesar removes his canteen from his saddle bag. Maurice notices her staring, follows her gaze to see Caesar drinking. Maurice grunts softly to her. She turns, and he gestures at Caesar, making the sign for:

MAURICE
[Thirsty.]
(repeats for her, teaching)

[Thirsty.]

She just stares blankly at Maurice. He takes her small hand in his, demonstrating the way to sign the word.

Caesar notices, lowering his canteen, quietly intrigued.

Maurice demonstrates again. But the Girl shows no interest or understanding. Her eyes return to Caesar -- who for the first time softens, offering a sympathetic gaze.

EXT. WOODED AREA - LATE AFTERNOON

The group have left the trail, moving through dense forest.

Caesar watches Bad Ape who peers anxiously ahead... to where SUNLIGHT spills in at the edge of the woods. Bad Ape turns to meet Caesar’s eyes, fearful:

BAD APE
There...

Caesar looks at the light, then turns to the others, raising his hand for them to stop.

CUT TO:

EDGE OF THE WOODS - MOMENTS LATER

On foot now, the group presses in close behind the trees at the forest’s perimeter, squinting into the hard, low sun at --
 



(CONTINUED)
 
46.

CONTINUED:

AN ENORMOUS CANYON BELOW THEM

Steep, snow-covered granite cliffs slope down in shelves, disappearing into an unseen expanse below.

The TOP OF A MASSIVE, PRISON-STYLE WARDEN’S TOWER pokes ominously up in the distance, from the center of the chasm.

Caesar raises the binoculars, PEERING AT THE TOWER: sun flares off the cement and steel structure, stained with corrosion. Through the windows, it appears to be DESERTED.

Caesar lowers the glasses, staring uncertainly -- when he notices something about the FADED CALIFORNIA STATE FLAG hanging from the tower -- he looks through the binoculars to examine it: the flag is hung upside-down... and a HUGE “AΩΩ” has been painted in black across it.

Then Caesar suddenly notices movement down below -- he shifts the glasses to find TINY SILHOUETTED FIGURES, just barely visible along the edge of the lowest visible shelf.

Caesar turns, looks from face to face... then:

CAESAR
[Luca, let’s take a closer look.]
(to Rocket)

[Stay here.	Keep them safe.]

Rocket nods dutifully, and Caesar and Luca start off --

CUT TO:

THROUGH THE BINOCULARS - SUNSET

The HEAVILY SILHOUETTED FIGURES in the distance are still small, but from this closer vantage we can see now they’re in the midst of placing a series of about twelve MYSTERIOUS, X-SHAPED STRUCTURES along the cliff’s edge -- maybe this is some kind of defensive perimeter...?

REVEAL CAESAR LOWERING HIS BINOCULARS; he looks confused as he turns to Luca, lying beside him on the edge of a ridge
