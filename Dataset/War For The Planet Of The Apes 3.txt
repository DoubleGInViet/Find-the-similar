LUCA
[What are they doing?]

CAESAR
(shakes his head)

I don’t know...
 






(CONTINUED)
 
47.

CONTINUED:

Caesar turns back, looking through the binoculars again, trying to decipher this strange activity -- when Luca GRUNTS at him with quiet alarm. Caesar turns.

LUCA
(points)

[What’s that?	A patrol?]

Caesar looks --

THROUGH THE BINOCULARS

finding a PAIR OF HORSES on a ledge right below.

CAESAR (O.S.)
Don’t see riders...

Suddenly AN OUT OF FOCUS SHAPE RISES directly in front of the binoculars -- Caesar drops the glasses to discover --

AN ALPHA OMEGA SOLDIER looming right above him, rifle raised!

The soldier pulls the trigger -- CLICK -- but the gun is jammed! Panicked, the soldier rears back, about to lunge forward with the rifle’s BAYONET -- when --

LUCA DIVES PROTECTIVELY in front of Caesar --

--	taking the bayonet blade in his gut as he YANKS the man down, WRESTLING him to the ground! They roll violently, finally coming to a stop, Luca atop the motionless soldier --

Caesar’s eyes land on the BLOOD-STAINED BAYONET, lying in the snow beside them -- he scrambles up, rushing to Luca --

--	when a SECOND SOLDIER steps out, startling Caesar -- about to shoot -- when --

WHAM! THE SECOND SOLDIER CRUMPLES, revealing Rocket behind him, having just clubbed him with the butt of a rifle.

Rocket looks to Caesar, signs regretfully, out of breath:

ROCKET
[I saw them from up there... Coming for you...]

They both turn immediately to Luca... who is rolling painfully off the dead man; he looks at them helplessly, GASPING, clutching his gut... CUT TO:
 
48.



BACK UP IN THE WOODS - DUSK

Waiting anxiously at the edge of the trees, Bad Ape, Maurice and the Girl stare as --

ROCKET returns, climbing quickly up toward them, a grim expression on his face, clutching the bayoneted rifle in his hand... right behind him, CAESAR CARRIES LUCA across his back, like a Vietnam soldier shouldering a fallen brother.

They all retreat into the safety of the woods, the group converging around Caesar as he lowers Luca to the ground...

Emotion in his eyes, Caesar looks down at his loyal friend. Fading fast, Luca smiles weakly. He manages to raise a hand, holding it out to Caesar; Caesar grasps it firmly.

LUCA
[At least this time... I was able to protect you...]

Deeply affected, Caesar holds Luca’s gaze a silent moment, and then Luca releases his grasp, his hand drifting to the ground as the rest of the group looks on. Her eyes fixed on the massive gorilla, the Girl climbs off Maurice’s back...

The others watch, surprised, as she approaches Luca, climbing onto his chest. She stares down, her little face inches from his... for the first time we see deep emotion in her eyes.

Luca peers up vulnerably as she removes the twig of flowers he placed behind her ear... and gently tucks it behind his; she begins to cry. Caesar is struck by her display of emotion. Luca smiles at her, then gradually his smile fades as his face grows still... and life ebbs from his eyes.

TIGHT ON CAESAR, staring intensely at Luca, a mixture of rage and guilt in his eyes. The others watch him silently. Finally, Maurice ventures a SOFT GRUNT to him. Caesar turns.

MAURICE
[I know how much you have lost... But now we have lost another.]

Caesar just stares, inscrutable.

MAURICE (CONT’D)
[Please... it’s not too late to leave this place. To rejoin the others.]

Emotion stirring, Rocket cannot hold back --
 




(CONTINUED)
 
49.

CONTINUED:

ROCKET
[Luca gave his life! We can not turn back -- !]

Maurice remains fixed on Caesar --

MAURICE
[Caesar...]

But Caesar turns away. He shakes his head grimly; then utters quietly, consumed:

CAESAR
They must pay...

Everyone stares, until finally, Caesar turns back. His eyes meet Maurice’s, whose gaze now appears judgemental:

MAURICE
[Now you sound like Koba.]

Caesar turns to his friend, suddenly seething; the look in his eyes is chilling:

CAESAR
...Koba? You know nothing. My wife and son were killed.
(gestures to Luca)
And now my friend.
(then, harder)
You call me Koba...?!

Caesar glares at him, an unprecedented rift between them.
Rocket remains still, taken aback... waiting...	Then:

CAESAR (CONT’D)
(trembling with rage)

I did not ask you to come. Any of you. This is my fight. I will finish it alone... Go now. Join the others.

Stunned, they watch as Caesar rises, and takes the bayoneted rifle from Rocket’s shoulder... then heads off, back toward the canyon...

HOLD on the apes’ harrowed expressions, watching him; CUT TO:

HELICOPTER SHOT HIGH AND WIDE OVER THE GRANITE CLIFFS - NIGHT

SWOOPING OVER Caesar’s tiny figure as he scales down the vast, snowy expanse in the moonlight; he DROPS down to a lower shelf, and we CUT TO:
 
50.



CAESAR’S POV

BREATHING HARD (O.S.), MOVING toward the CLIFF’S EDGE -- the massive guard tower reaches up from the canyon beyond it --

ON CAESAR, air steaming from his nose; he SLOWS, SEEING -- THE TWELVE MYSTERIOUS X-SHAPED STRUCTURES looming ahead --
As he approaches we can suddenly start to make out DARK FORMS STRAPPED to them...? Caesar’s expression moves from confusion... to dawning horror as he realizes: the forms appear to be APES. He picks up speed again, rushing toward them, their backs to us -- it’s unclear whether the forms are dead or alive...

Finally reaching the line of crosses at the edge of the cliff, he finds a GROUP OF APES, all semi-conscious, struggling to breathe, bound to Xs by their hands and feet...

Reeling, Caesar whips his head from ape to ape, trying to make sense of this -- when he HEARS A DREADFUL MURMUR RISING from the canyon; heart racing, he spins, staggering toward the edge to PEER DOWN --

INTO THE CANYON

at what looks like a ENORMOUS, FORMER PRISON CAMP at the base of the sheer mountains, three stories below.

As Caesar is drawn inexorably to the very edge of the cliff, OUTDOOR HOLDING PENS come slowly into view... INSIDE THE PENS ARE HUNDREDS OF APES, MURMURING helplessly...

THE EXODUS HAS BEEN CAPTURED.

Caesar stumbles back from the edge, overwhelmed, in shock...
He turns in panic to the bound apes -- suddenly recognizing

SPEAR among them.	He rushes to Spear’s side.

Spear looks like he’s near death, his head sagging. Caesar lifts Spear’s face in both hands -- Spear’s eyes slowly open; as they focus on Caesar, he can’t believe what he’s seeing.

Caesar yanks the bayonet off his rifle, quickly cuts Spear down. Spear slumps to his knees -- Caesar crouches to steady him as Spear struggles to sign, still stunned to see him.

CAESAR
What happened?
 






(CONTINUED)
 
51.

CONTINUED:

SPEAR
[They came out of nowhere, attacked us...

We were sure they would kill us all -- but the Colonel stopped them!]

Caesar stares at him, surprised --

SPEAR (CONT’D)
[There was madness in his eyes! He said they would use us, before we died.]

CAESAR
Use you...?

SPEAR
[They’ve been forcing us to work!]

Caesar turns to look below -- when Spear suddenly gives out, collapsing. Caesar quickly turns -- seeing brutal LASH MARKS across Spear’s back. Horrified, Caesar lifts Spear up, holding him in his arms.

CAESAR
What... kind of work...?

But Spear struggles for consciousness, his eyes fluttering closed... He begins to collapse -- Caesar is stricken:

CAESAR (CONT’D)
Wait -- my little son -- is he here...?

But Spear just falls to the ground, Caesar watches aghast -- when an APE FOOT steps right beside him -- Caesar turns, startled -- looks up to see --

RED standing ominously right above him! The BUTT OF RED’S RIFLE comes SLAMMING DOWN into us -- and we SMASH TO --

BLACKNESS

HOLD for a long moment. Hear the echoing sound of WATER SLOWLY DRIPPING. Then HARD CUT TO --

SUPER TIGHT ON CAESAR’S EYES

as they wince open, disoriented, in pain, his face pressed to the ground... A SHAFT OF HARSH LIGHT blasts down from above. Water drops splatter around him.

Caesar peers around, struggling to get his bearings, his POV drifting in and out of focus: he finds TRACKS embedded in the ground, a rusted-out TRAIN ENGINE in the shadows. The place was a depot of some kind.
 


(CONTINUED)
 
52.

CONTINUED:

He glances up at the cavernous, curved ceiling; sodium vapor security lamps shine in through a rip, which leaks melting snow. And then he notices --

AN OUT OF FOCUS FIGURE LOOMING IN THE DARKNESS

a few feet away: it’s PREACHER, tensely holding his crossbow, looking unsettled as he stands guard... when an unseen VOICE comes quietly from the shadows as WET FOOTSTEPS approach:

THE COLONEL (O.S.)
Grant and Lee...	Wellington and
Napoleon...

A SHAPE finally enters the light: it’s THE COLONEL, who studies Caesar inscrutably:

THE COLONEL (CONT’D)
Custer... and Sitting Bull.
(then)
You’re probably not much of a reader.
But this is... this is a big moment.

This is... beyond... historic.

Caesar glares up at him, rage welling...

THE COLONEL (CONT’D)
Where were you...?
(then)

We came upon your herd... we got lucky. But I was surprised. You weren’t with them.

They stare at each other an intense beat... Caesar crawls menacingly toward him -- but is instantly YANKED BACK HARD.

GASPING, Caesar reaches for his throat to discover his wrists are shackled and his neck is CHAINED by a NECK COLLAR...

Writhing, he turns to see RED cruelly gripping the end of the chain. Preacher takes a step closer, levelling his crossbow threateningly; Caesar’s eyes lock with his. The Colonel watches their stare-down:

THE COLONEL (CONT’D)
I hope you don’t come to regret sparing his life. He’s quite a good shot.

The Colonel just watches Caesar a beat; beneath the chilling stillness of his eyes we sense something dangerous, damaged.

THE COLONEL (CONT’D)
Have you finally come to save your apes?
 



(CONTINUED)
 
53.

CONTINUED: (2)

CAESAR
(still in pain, seething)
I... didn’t know they were here.
(then)

I came for you.

The Colonel searches Caesar’s ferocious expression, surprised, something dawning on him for the first time:

THE COLONEL
I see... I kill somebody close to you that night...?

Caesar looks him right in the eye, unblinking...

CAESAR
My... family.

The Colonel stares down, some mysterious nerve jolted inside him. He comes closer, stands right above Caesar, looking at him for a long beat, something about this revelation churning in his mind; Red cautiously tightens his grip on the chain.

THE COLONEL
I’m sorry.	I was there to kill you.

Caesar just glares up at him, the Colonel so close... Struck, the Colonel inches even closer:

THE COLONEL (CONT’D)
My God, look at your eyes... they’re almost human...
(a long beat; then)

How did you know I was here?

CAESAR
I was told you were coming... That others would be joining you here.

THE COLONEL
(a cryptic beat)

Joining me...?

CAESAR
To finish us off... for good.

THE COLONEL
(he smiles)

Who told you that?

But Caesar won’t answer. The Colonel just stares at him, then turns to Red and NODS:
 



(CONTINUED)
 
54.

CONTINUED: (3)

THE COLONEL (CONT’D)
Ok, let’s go.

Red quickly responds --

RED
Ok -- ok, Kerna...!

Red YANKS Caesar roughly to his feet; Caesar struggles,
CHOKING -- as Preacher moves in too -- and we HARD CUT TO:

EXT. PRISON CAMP - YARD - TRACKING SHOT - NIGHT

MOVING with the Colonel, Red, and Preacher as they march Caesar into the frozen, desolate yard; Caesar steals a glance back at a CORRODED SIGN over the hangar: CA STATE BORDER QUARANTINE DETENTION AND RELOCATION CENTER, PROCESSING DEPOT

As they walk along train tracks, Caesar turns forward, SEES SOLDIERS huddled around fires in front of temporary barracks, killing time -- they stare up at him menacingly -- up ahead --

A PAIR OF GUARD TOWERS LOOM

More HAND-PAINTED SLOGANS hang on signs, recalling the cult-like vibe of the base camp. Armed GUARDS stare down as they pass, straightening tensely at the sight of the Colonel --

TOWER GUARD
Evening, Colonel!

THE COLONEL
(not even looking at him)

Any more trouble tonight?

TOWER GUARD
(eager to please)

No, sir -- not anymore --

He gestures, and Caesar follows it to the LINE OF TWELVE APES bound to the Xs on the granite shelf above. The Colonel finally glances up at the Guard, eyes fixing critically --

THE COLONEL
You could use a haircut there, son.
(seeing the other guard)

You too, soldier.

BOTH TOWER GUARDS
Sir, yessir!

Red jerks Caesar’s head back in line as they start to pass --
 



(CONTINUED)
 
55.

CONTINUED:

HOLDING PENS ON EITHER SIDE OF THEM

Caesar looks into one of the pens... to see MASSES of CHAIN-GANGED APES peering out mutely, shocked to see him. Caesar stares back at them with tortured empathy -- when to his surprise -- a change comes over their faces, and many begin to avert their eyes... a sense they feel betrayed by him...

Stunned, Caesar marches on, devastated by the dawning realization his apes have lost faith in him -- when PLAINTIVE SHRIEKS suddenly seize his attention --

He quickly turns to the other pen... it is filled with APE CHILDREN... they gaze helplessly at him -- when, suddenly, one presses through to the fence, pushing his way past the others, terrified as he tries to keep pace with Caesar; Caesar is overcome by the sight of HIS SHRIEKING SON.

Caesar nervously glances at the Colonel, worried he’ll notice; he turns back to his son, shaking his head urgently, trying to quiet him --

--	when the Colonel starts to turn... Seeing this, Caesar has no choice -- he quickly turns away from his own child...

HOLD ON CORNELIUS, watching his father walk away --

THE DOOR TO THE ADULT APE PEN

swings open as the group arrives; Caesar peers in at the hordes of prisoners --

The Colonel nods, and Red HURLS Caesar violently to the ground, grabbing his leg HARD and shackling Caesar to the others.

Red returns the key to Preacher -- Caesar staring up at the Colonel, who watches an eerie moment longer, then heads off. The others follow.

TIGHT ON CAESAR; he looks up at the ape prisoners... They all stare at him coldly, and then turn their backs on him. Caesar lifts his head, stunned... as ANOTHER GROUP turns away... and ANOTHER. A quiet ape sound makes Caesar turn -- he finds LAKE in their midst, gazing back consolingly:

LAKE
[Forgive them.	We’ve been through much.]

Caesar nods, shell-shocked, reeling... Finally, he speaks, quietly devastated:
 




(CONTINUED)
 
56.

CONTINUED:

CAESAR
I will find some way to get us out of here. I promise...

LAKE
(shakes her head, grim)

[You don’t know what this place is like.]

The sound of crying makes Caesar turn; he looks at the pen across the way, where little Cornelius is pressed to the bars, helplessly reaching his arm out toward Caesar:

CORNELIUS
[Father...!]

As Caesar gapes back, heartbroken, guilt-stricken, we CUT TO:

EXT. WIDE VISTA AT THE BASE OF THE MOUNTAIN LANDSCAPE - DAWN

We see the camp in the distance, nestled at the foot of the mountains; a dilapidated barrier wall stretches out from the front of it in both directions as far as the eye can see.

INT. ADULT APE PEN - MOVING SHOT - DAWN

TRAVELING OVER THE SLEEPING APES, chained on the icy
ground... we hear the sound of DISTANT MARCHING, when a LONE HUMAN VOICE BEGINS SINGING out hauntingly across the yard in a militaristic gospel tone:

EXECUTIVE OFFICER (O.S.)
Hu-uh-left... Left-right-left...

THE CAMERA ARRIVES AT CAESAR, who stirs, his eyes opening as the SINGING CONTINUES. PUSH IN on Caesar, confused, as apes around him start to wake up as well, a palpable anxiety spreading... he looks at Ape Elder who shakes his head, grim.

Caesar turns at the building sound of at least THREE HUNDRED SOLDIERS MARCHING in formation outside the APE PENS; he rises, anxiously scans the rigid faces, intensity burning in their eyes as they march past the frightened, caged apes.

As the SINGING STOPS, the soldiers abruptly halt, turning about face, eyes fixed upward; Caesar follows the gazes to --

THE EMPTY WARDEN’S TOWER BALCONY

the “AΩΩ” FLAG waving just below it. Chilled, Caesar watches as the soldiers all hold in fervent SALUTE, and the X.O. cries out, leading a MARINES-STYLE CALL-AND-RESPONSE:
 




(CONTINUED)
 
57.

CONTINUED:

EXECUTIVE OFFICER (CONT’D)
Blood...!

SOLDIERS
MAKES THE GRASS GROW!!

EXECUTIVE OFFICER
We...!

SOLDIERS
MAKE THE BLOOD FLOW!!

EXECUTIVE OFFICER
We are the beginning...!

SOLDIERS
AND THE END!!

Caesar stares, unnerved, as the Soldiers’ call-and-response crescendos in OMINOUS CHANTS OF “OO-RAH!” as they gaze up at the tower, where finally... THE COLONEL SLOWLY EMERGES; he’s shirtless, despite the cold, not fully dressed yet -- he stares down at the assembled troops, casually shaving the back of his head with a straight razor as chants ROAR below.

A shrill chorus of ARMY WHISTLES suddenly breaks out --

Caesar quickly turns to see the soldiers moving for the pens; as the doors unlock, ARMED SOLDIERS enter and Red and the TURNCOATS storm in, forcing the lines of chained apes to their feet and into the yard with WHIPS -- it’s terrifying.

CLOSE ON THE COLONEL

watching the brutality; he stops shaving a moment, calmly pulls a FLASK from his hip, and takes a slow drink; then he disappears into the tower again.

CUT TO:

CAESAR

MARCHING gravely with hordes of apes across the snowy yard... ARMED SOLDIERS pace menacingly atop FUEL TANKER RAILCARS along the side of the camp, keeping watch over the prisoners. Caesar slows, suddenly struck by what’s LOOMING up ahead --

THE EXTREMELY HIGH BARRIER WALL

that seals in the front of the camp; it’s unlike anything we’ve ever seen. Part of it is man-made, cracked slabs of weathered concrete erected side by side years ago; but a vast section, growing right out of the original wall, is ape-made.
 


(CONTINUED)
 
58.

CONTINUED:

Massive tree-trunks have been fastened in a primitive but elaborate framework, into which huge stones are being set, one by one. The apes have been rebuilding the crumbling wall.

As Caesar moves closer, his eyes are drawn to an old slab of cement, still standing in the midst of the ape construction. On it, “AΩΩ” is painted in HUGE BLOOD RED GRAFFITI SCRAWL; next to this drip the words: “HUMANITY’S LAST STAND”. Caesar stares at the words, chilled... as we CUT TO:

EXT. THE WALL - DAY

Caesar labors, just another slave in the sea of apes passing brutally heavy boulders to be laid into the growing wall, as Soldiers keep GUNS trained on them. Caesar squints out at even more apes perched dangerously on the rock shelf above the tanker cars, quarrying for the stones.

Beside him, Lake heaves another boulder; Caesar peers past her at the apes around them; they look WEARY, GAUNT; on the framework above, EXHAUSTED apes -- Ape Elder among them -- battle to lift boulders on ropes. Lake sees the anguish on Caesar’s face as he takes in the suffering, she signs:

LAKE
[We haven’t had food or water since we got here...]

Stunned, anger fills his face; he glares up at the structure:

CAESAR
[Why do they need a wall...?]

Lake looks back at him, shaking her head: I don’t know -- when Caesar sees --

THE COLONEL arriving at the work site; his Soldiers nervously address him as his eyes roam the wall, surveying the progress -- then fix on Caesar -- when suddenly a SOLDIER CRIES OUT:

BOYLE (O.S.)
HEY!	HEY!

The Colonel turns to the commotion -- Caesar turns too -- to find Ape Elder struggling high up on the framework, dizzy with fatigue, losing grip on his rope as Soldiers and Turncoat Apes watch with alarm from below --

-- when he COLLAPSES, the rope ripping from his fingers -- the rock CRASHES into the framing, KNOCKING DOWN a big section of the stone wall in a violent chain reaction!
 




(CONTINUED)
 
59.

CONTINUED:

Furious, Boyle spins to one of the Turncoats -- Red. Caesar watches as he orders Red to punish Ape Elder; Red and the other turncoats pull the feeble ape from the rubble and drag him into the yard, in full sight of the Colonel, where Red dutifully begins to WHIP the old ape...!

Startled, Caesar looks at the Colonel, who watches the beating, unmoved -- then back to the helpless old chimp --

ON CAESAR

as he steps slowly forward in horror, pained by the excruciating sight -- the apes in his line follow, affected too... Caesar pulls himself up onto one of the tree trunks in the framework, stepping into a CLOSE UP, his rage starting to boil... until finally, unable to bear it, he ERUPTS:

CAESAR
LEAVE HIM!!!

Heads turn, everyone stopping dead in their tracks as CAESAR’S BOOMING VOICE ECHOES across the yard... Even Red goes still, turning with the others to SEE --

CAESAR UP ON THE FRAMEWORK

GLARING back defiantly; then, he turns slowly to the Colonel, fury in his eyes, no concern for his own safety...

For a moment, the yard is suspended in TOTAL SILENCE as Caesar and the Colonel lock eyes -- when, one by one, the APES START TO CHANT...

Low and guttural at first... then RISING INTO A DEAFENING CHORUS OF REBELLIOUS HOOTS AND SHRIEKS -- as they defiantly DROP THE STONES AND TOOLS to the ground!

Surprised, Caesar turns... stunned by what he has started... he peers around at the apes, to find them all gazing at him in solidarity as they chant...

CLOSE ON APE ELDER still on his knees, clutching his wounds, watching in awe as the protest reaches a fever pitch...

The Soldiers are at a loss as to how to restore order -- they turn to the Colonel who just stares ominously at Caesar...

Eyes fearfully on the Colonel, a SOLDIER FRANTICALLY GESTURES across the chaos to Red and the Turncoats: get him!

CAESAR
 




(CONTINUED)
 
60.

CONTINUED: (2)

turns as Turncoats and Soldiers approach (Preacher among them); unafraid, Caesar steps down to meet them -- his chain gang CHANTING protectively -- when the Turncoats GRAB Caesar! The Soldiers anxiously hold the others in check with their weapons -- as the roar of the crowd grows even LOUDER --

Caesar glares as Preacher nervously unclips his keys from his belt, tosses them to Red, who unshackles him...

THE COLONEL

watches as Caesar is marched into the yard, and thrust onto his knees beside Ape Elder. The Colonel considers Caesar; then, eyes still on him, gestures calmly to the Turncoats --

The Turncoats tighten their grip on Caesar’s arms -- and Red suddenly WHIPS Caesar’s back with a VICIOUS SNAP!

The APES’ CHANTING SUDDENLY FALTERS as --

Caesar WINCES -- but he refuses to break eye-contact with the Colonel, who stares back, a battle of wills...

The Colonel nods; and Red LASHES Caesar again!

Spirits broken, the apes go SILENT; beside Caesar, Ape Elder drops his eyes.

Red looks to the Colonel, lowering his switch -- but the Colonel’s eyes remain fixed on Caesar’s, the two leaders just staring at each other, neither giving in...

And then the Colonel NODS to Red again. Surprised, Red hesitates -- then, LASHES Caesar once more, the CRACK echoing through the silent camp. The Colonel coldly nods again; even Red is shaken by the Colonel’s relentlessness. Red slowly lifts his whip again -- and --

WHAP! Caesar finally DROPS HIS HEAD, broken by the pain. GASPS ripple through the apes. The Colonel nods to the Turncoats, who release Caesar; he crumples to the ground.

THE COLONEL
...Ok.	Back to work.

The SOLDIERS YELL for the apes to get back to work; but the apes just stare at Caesar, worried, as he lies on the ground.

Caesar finally lifts his head, his face now smeared in MUD; he looks at the apes, then glowers back at the Colonel, fiercely gritting his teeth:
 




(CONTINUED)
 
61.

CONTINUED: (3)

CAESAR
Apes need food.	Water.

The Colonel glances at the apes, then back at Caesar:

THE COLONEL
Please.	Tell them to work.

CAESAR
(simmering)

Give them food and wat--

--	without warning the Colonel suddenly pulls his sidearm and shoots Ape Elder dead right beside Caesar, then immediately places the gun against Caesar’s temple -- the speed and efficiency of the action is utterly chilling.

Caesar gapes in shock as terror ripples through the apes.

THE COLONEL
(an eerie calm)

Tell them.

Caesar stares silently at him, unflinching, trembling with rage -- as the Colonel SLOWLY COUNTS DOWN:

THE COLONEL (CONT’D)
Five...	Four...

He tightens his finger on the trigger; but Caesar remains stoic, willing to die...

THE COLONEL (CONT’D)
Three...	Two...

And suddenly an APE by the wall quickly reaches out and picks up one of the boulders, desperate to save Caesar’s life --

It’s LAKE. The Colonel pauses at the sight, gun still raised... Caesar turns to see her, surprised...

And then ANOTHER APE picks up a boulder. Then another... Caesar watches, distraught, as more and more apes pick up stones and tools. The Colonel finally lowers his gun. Caesar glares back at him bitterly.

THE COLONEL (CONT’D)
(turns to Red)

String him up, donkey.

And the Colonel heads off; Preacher stares down at Caesar with pity as Red moves in... CUT TO:
 
62.



A HIGH-ANGLE BINOCULAR POV OF CAESAR BEING TIED TO AN X

The X has been erected atop a platform on the tracks in the center of the yard, for all to see; Red binds him up as Preacher stands guard... As the POV starts to drop, REVEAL --

MAURICE - HIDDEN ON A CLIFF’S EDGE

Lowering the binoculars, in utter shock; lying beside him are Rocket and Bad Ape, eyes glued to his expression. Maurice hands Rocket the binoculars to see for himself --

BAD APE
(warning them, fearful)

Bad place...

But the apes ignore him. He turns to the Girl on Maurice’s back, looking for anyone who’ll listen:

BAD APE (CONT’D)
Bad, bad place.

She just stares at him, blank-faced.

Peering through the glasses, Rocket makes a low anguished grunt. Bad Ape turns anxiously:

BAD APE (CONT’D)
What?	What you see...?

THROUGH THE BINOCULARS

Rocket sees Caesar on the X, face covered in mud; the POV WHIPS to the MASSES OF CHAINED APES at the wall.

ROCKET sets the glasses down, turns to Maurice, overwhelmed:

ROCKET
[Must save them!	But how?]

MAURICE
[Must think!	What would Caesar do?]

BAD APE
Oh no!

They look over to see Bad Ape squinting into the binoculars --

BAD APE (CONT’D)
(horrified)

Why so small?
 




(CONTINUED)
 
63.

CONTINUED:

He lowers the glasses to look at them, appalled. They just stare at him. Then Rocket reaches out and flips the binoculars the right way around, hands them back. Bad Ape looks at him, confused. He peers through again.

BAD APE (CONT’D)
(finally seeing the crisis
below)

Ohhhh...

ON THE PLATFORM

Red finishes roughly binding Caesar, who looks haggard.

PREACHER
Alright -- that’s good.

Red turns. Preacher jerks his head: go. Red takes a last menacing look at Caesar, then starts down the platform. Preacher watches him go... then turns back to Caesar;

he hesitates... then lowers his voice, hurriedly confiding:

PREACHER (CONT’D)
Look, I owe you one, so let me set you straight here, ok? I think he respects you, he does... that’s why you’re still alive. But believe me, he can do a lot worse than this. I’ve seen it.
(haunted, almost a whisper)
You do not want to agitate the man.
Understand?	So just...

He gestures with his hand: back off. Disturbed, Caesar holds his gaze; then watches as Preacher descends the platform...

CUT TO:

BEHIND CAESAR HANGING LIMPLY ON THE X - NIGHT

We’re looking out past Caesar over the camp, as exhausted apes are herded away from the wall, the work day over... A diesel GENERATOR COUGHS to life, HARSH LIGHTS blinking on.

Caesar squints into the glare, weary -- when the SOUND OF SOLDIERS makes him look below -- at a group approaching from the rear of the camp, rolling ominous-looking ARTILLERY; suddenly concerned, he watches them head toward the apes...

...the fraught apes look alarmed as they see the weapons and Soldiers coming their way -- then Caesar discovers even more Soldiers with MASSIVE MACHINE GUNS by the wall. Unnerved, he sees them hoisting the guns up to the sentry towers... where others position them on tripods; but then Caesar NOTICES --
 


(CONTINUED)
 
64.

CONTINUED:

All the weapons are POINTED OUTWARD, BEYOND THE CAMP...

Caesar is relieved; he stares at the weapons, perplexed -- when he hears FOOTSTEPS; he turns to see --

RED climbing the platform toward him, gripping a long MACHETE with a look of cruel satisfaction... Startled, Caesar tenses; he peers around anxiously to FIND --

THE COLONEL eerily watching from the warden tower window...

Chilled, Caesar turns back, bracing for the worst, as Red stops before him... He looks at the knife, then meets Red’s cold gaze. Steeling himself, he hardens, his voice hoarse:

CAESAR
What did the Colonel promise you? You really think he will let you live... after we are gone?

Red just stares, contempt in his eyes.

CAESAR (CONT’D)
No matter what you do... you’ll never be one of them.
(then)
You let them call you “donkey”...

You are ape.

Red raises his knife, examining it in his hands; he runs his fingers along the edge... Then looks at Caesar, sneers:

RED
Koba right.	You think you know better...
than rest of apes.	But look you now.
(his expression darkens)
You nothing.

Red SUDDENLY LIFTS THE MACHETE -- Caesar’s eyes widen as RED SWINGS DOWN AT HIM VICIOUSLY -- THWAP!!! THE BLADE SINKS INTO THE WOOD, AN INCH FROM CAESAR’S WRIST, HACKING THROUGH THE ROPE -- ! Caesar turns to Red in shock, as his arm is set free.

RED (CONT’D)
(menacing, quiet)

Kerna... want see you.

Caesar looks back up at the tower window where the Colonel remains staring a moment longer; then turns, and disappears.

CUT TO:
 
65.



BLACKNESS

Then a DOOR IS OPENED, REVEALING -- we are --

INT. WARDEN’S TOWER - NIGHT

The Colonel stands with his back to us, leaning on a map-covered table in the former window-lined control center, smoke rises from sage and grass smudge burning in a tin bowl.

CAESAR, PREACHER AND RED ENTER

approaching the Colonel, who still doesn’t acknowledge them; as searchlights outside sweep through, Caesar catches a brief glimpse of a room just off the control center -- it looks almost like a sanctum; light passes over APE SKULLS... the word “HISTORY” scrawled on a wall... then the room goes dark again. Caesar looks unsettled -- his gaze returning to the Colonel, and noticing for the first time painful looking BRAND SCARS on the back of his hands: one Alpha, one Omega.

The Colonel finally speaks, eyes still on the map:

THE COLONEL
Interfere with the work again, and I’ll begin slaughtering the apes, one by one. Understand? I need that wall.

He looks up coldly at Caesar, then nods at Preacher: that’s all -- they start to lead Caesar out, but he won’t go yet --

CAESAR
Apes... need food... water.

THE COLONEL
(eyes on the map)

They’ll get food and water when they finish the work.

CAESAR
Give them food and water... or they will not be able to finish.

The Colonel looks up, amused by Caesar’s audacity.

THE COLONEL
You know you’re very emotional.
(then)

What makes you think you’re in a position to make demands?

Caesar doesn’t reply. The Colonel turns back to the map -- Preacher nervously tugs again on Caesar’s chain --
 


(CONTINUED)
 
66.

CONTINUED:

PREACHER
C’mon --

But Caesar stands firm, eyes fixed on the Colonel:

CAESAR
The soldiers who are coming here... are not coming to join you, are they?

The Colonel slowly looks up, smiles, suddenly intrigued -- as Red warily tightens his grip on Caesar’s chain...

CAESAR (CONT’D)
I saw men outside by the wall...

preparing for battle...

The Colonel studies him, surprised:

THE COLONEL
I was told you were smart, but... that’s impressive.

He stares at Caesar a moment; then finally:

THE COLONEL (CONT’D)
No.	They won’t be joining me.

CAESAR
They are against you?

THE COLONEL
They... fear me.

CAESAR
Why...?

The Colonel just looks at him, silent.

CAESAR (CONT’D)
Because you kill your own men?

Preacher tenses; The Colonel holds Caesar’s gaze, stunned...

CAESAR (CONT’D)
We found bodies.
(then)

Something wrong... with these men.

The Colonel shakes his head in awe:

THE COLONEL
Jesus Christ... you are impressive.
(then, almost enjoying this)

(CONTINUED)
 
67.

CONTINUED: (2)

THE COLONEL (CONT'D)
Well, you paint quite a picture. What you must think of me.

CAESAR
I think... you have no mercy.

The Colonel goes still, a deep nerve struck.	He DARKENS:

THE COLONEL
You came here to kill me. Were you going to show me mercy?

CAESAR
I showed you mercy... when I spared your men. I offered you peace. And you killed my family.

THE COLONEL
(low, with contempt)

Mercy. Do you have any idea what your mercy would do to us?

Caesar stares warily, confused by the simmering rage he seems to have provoked in the Colonel.

THE COLONEL (CONT’D)
You’re much stronger than we are. And you’re smart as hell. No matter what you say, you’d eventually replace us, that’s the law of Nature. The irony is, we created you. We tried to defy Nature, bend it to our will. And Nature’s been punishing us for our arrogance ever since. Testing us. Even now.

Caesar searches the Colonel’s ominous expression...	Then:

THE COLONEL (CONT’D)
Ten months ago, we sent out recon units to look for your base. They found nothing. My own son was a soldier with one of the groups. One day he suddenly stopped speaking. He became...
primitive. Like an animal. They contacted me, said they thought he lost his mind, that the war was too much for him. But then the man caring for him stopped speaking too. Their medic had a theory, before he stopped speaking. That the virus that almost wiped us out -- the virus every human survivor still carries –- had suddenly changed... Mutated.
(peers at Caesar)

68.

CONTINUED: (3)

THE COLONEL (CONT’D) And if it spread, it would destroy humanity for good this time. Not by killing us... but by robbing us of the things that make us human. Our speech, our higher thinking... It would turn us into beasts... not unlike what you all used to be. You talk about mercy...? What would you have done?

Caesar stares back, unnerved, challenged... he has no answer.

THE COLONEL (CONT’D)
Well, it was a moment of clarity for me. I realized I would have to sacrifice my only son, so that humanity could be saved. I held that gun in my hand, and I pointed it at my only child.
(emotion in his eyes as he
remembers)
He looked at me with trust in his eyes, all he had left in his primitive gaze. And I pulled the trigger. It purified me. It made my purpose clear.

His eyes finally return to Caesar’s, who looks stunned.

THE COLONEL (CONT’D)
I gave orders to kill the other infected, all of them, and anyone who might’ve been in direct contact, even if they showed no symptoms. We burned their belongings, anything that might spread contamination. Some of the men questioned my judgment. I was asking them to do what I had done: to sacrifice their families... their friends. They refused. So I had them killed too.
(growing darker)

Others with children deserted into the woods. One of those cowards fled to my superiors up north. They sent officers down to restrain me. They tried to convince me this plague could be dealt with medically, that up there they were already looking for a cure. That’s when I realized: they had learned nothing from our past.
