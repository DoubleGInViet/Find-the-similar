CAESAR
(harrowed)

You killed them too...?

69.

CONTINUED: (4)

THE COLONEL
What did I do, Preacher?

PREACHER
(a beat, quietly)

You severed their heads, sir.

THE COLONEL
Except for the one I spared, so he could return to deliver a message: if they wanted to relieve me of my command, they’d have to meet me here, and do it themselves.

Caesar stares, his eyes questioning what the Colonel means --

THE COLONEL (CONT’D)
This place used to be a weapons depot. They turned it into a relocation camp when the crisis was just beginning. But the weapons are all still here, inside that mountain.
(a beat)
This is a holy war. All of human history has led to this moment. And if we lose, we’ll be the last of our kind. It will be a planet of apes. And we’ll become your cattle.

Caesar just stares, unsettled; they hold each other’s eyes...

THE COLONEL (CONT’D)
Look at you. You think I’m sick, don’t you.

CAESAR
How many... will be coming?

THE COLONEL
Probably all of them. Don’t get any ideas -- only thing they fear more than me is you apes. They never questioned my methods when it came to you.

He moves closer, looking at Caesar’s face, his tone quieter:

THE COLONEL (CONT’D)
I didn’t mean to kill your son...

Caesar remains totally still as the Colonel studies him...
The Colonel’s nearness is almost too much to bear...
 




(CONTINUED)
 
70.

CONTINUED: (5)

THE COLONEL (CONT’D)
(leaning in even closer)

But if his destiny was to inherit your unholy kingdom... then I’m glad I did.

A sudden rage surges behind Caesar’s eyes -- HE LUNGES -- ! The Colonel LEAPS BACKWARD -- Caesar’s fingers GROPING FOR HIS THROAT as he SCRAMBLES out of reach JUST IN TIME -- Red SUDDENLY SEIZES CAESAR’S CHAIN -- WRENCHING CAESAR BACK HARD!

The Colonel HITS the floor, FLASK tumbling from his jacket -- Panicked, FURIOUSLY LEVELS HIS CROSSBOW -- SCREAMING --

PREACHER
HEY -- HEY-HEY-HEY!!!

CAESAR SEETHES, raging in vain against the restraint --

In shock, the Colonel gathers himself, picks up the flask, self-consciously pocketing it as he stands, backing away -- he touches the side of his neck to find Caesar nicked him. He looks at the BLOOD on his fingers with a rush, smiling breathlessly as Caesar strains, CHOKING in Red’s grasp:

THE COLONEL
So emotional!

The Colonel watches, smile fading as Caesar finally relents:

THE COLONEL (CONT’D)
I can see how conflicted you are. You’re confused in your purpose. You’re angry at me because of something I did that was an act of war. But you’re taking this all much too personally.

Preacher watches as The Colonel steps forward, venturing closer to Caesar, seemingly unconcerned for his safety...

PREACHER
...sir --

The Colonel holds up his hand to silence Preacher as he stops right in front of Caesar again, eye to eye... Caesar burns, tortured by the agonizing effort to restrain his rage...

THE COLONEL
What do you think my men would’ve done to your apes... if you had killed me?

Caesar looks up at the Colonel. The Colonel holds Caesar’s angry stare as he starts slowly forward:
 



(CONTINUED)
 
71.

CONTINUED: (6)

THE COLONEL (CONT’D)
Or is killing me more important...?

The Colonel lingers tauntingly... finally, he turns to Preacher -- and as Preacher and Red move in, we --

CUT TO:

PREACHER AND RED MARCHING CAESAR OUT OF THE DEPOT - NIGHT

They head for the yard -- Preacher utters quietly, shaken:

PREACHER
Didn’t I tell you not to agitate him?

That was not smart, man...

Caesar glances at Preacher, then at Red behind them; he turns forward, speaks softly to Preacher, a hint of sympathy:

CAESAR
If this battle is coming... you should leave, while you still can.

Preacher turns to him; then abruptly stops:

PREACHER
Leave?	What are you talking about?

CAESAR
You are not like him.

Preacher looks at Caesar, taken aback -- maybe even offended:

PREACHER
He was right, you do think he’s sick, don’t you? You’re just like them. He’s not crazy. The world’s gone crazy. And he’s the only one with the vision to get us through this. The Colonel’s a great man. He sacrificed everything for us. You can’t judge him. Who are you to judge him?
(darkening)

I was trying to give you a heads up, keep you out of his way, I don’t even know why. But if you think you and I have some kind of relationship -- that you’re gonna give me, what, advice? You can disavow yourself of that notion right fucking now.

Caesar is stunned.	Preacher raises his crossbow:

PREACHER (CONT’D)
C’mon, kong.

He glances back, nodding to Red O.S., and we --

CUT TO:

HAND-HELD BINOCULAR POV AS RED SHOVES CAESAR FORWARD

Snow drifts down around them as they march Caesar through the yard, past the soldiers’ barracks, LIGHTS inside GOING OUT one by one... REVEAL --

ON THE CLIFFS JUST ABOVE THE CAMP - NIGHT

Concealed behind boulders, Rocket LOWERING THE BINOCULARS, gravely SCOPING OUT the camp -- as Maurice, the Girl on his back, and Bad Ape arrive next to him, climbing down rocks.

MAURICE
(worried)

[How is he?]

Rocket shakes his head: not good. He rises, waves for them to follow him further down the mountain. They start to go...

EXT. YARD - NEAR THE PENS - NIGHT

Caesar waits grimly at the base of the platform, as Red unshackles his hands; Preacher stands guard, the X looming.

Caesar looks up to discover APES gathered at the bars of their pen, unseen by Red and Preacher, whose backs are to them. Their starved faces are etched with worry for Caesar. He softens, eyes settling on Lake’s gentle gaze as Red continues to unshackle him. Concern fills Lake’s eyes:

LAKE
[You look weary.]

Caesar looks back at her, then peers out at the MASS OF DISPIRITED APE FACES. Determination sets in; he steals a look at his captors, then signs discreetly to the apes:

CAESAR
[Do not lose hope... Some way, somehow, we will finish the journey to our new home. I will find a way to get us out of here.]

The Apes return moved stares -- when Red hands Preacher back the key, and Preacher nods for Caesar to climb the platform.
 



(CONTINUED)
 
73.

CONTINUED:

Lake and the others watch as Caesar, weakened, takes an exhausted step -- and suddenly STUMBLES, knocking into Preacher -- who shoves him back, startled --

PREACHER
Get off!

The Apes look scared for Caesar as Red yanks him down.

Recovering, Caesar lifts his head, glancing meaningfully back at Lake, then rises to his feet...

Confused, Lake watches as Caesar continues up the steps -- when she notices CAESAR’S HAND slipping behind his back -- as the hand subtly opens, Lake suddenly SEES Caesar is carefully showing her something --

Preacher’s shackle key is now concealed in Caesar’s palm, its small key ring looped slyly around his middle finger.

Lake can’t believe her eyes; with dawning hope she turns, points it out to the others -- their eyes widen, excitement spreading as they watch him ascend the platform...

EXT. SNOWY CANYON FLOOR OUTSIDE THE PRISON WALL - LATE NIGHT

Rocket leads as the group sneaks along the base of the wall. They arrive at a spot where the wall has come down, steal a look around the edge, peering into the camp...

...to see the apes in their pens, Caesar on the X, and between here and there, SOLDIERS on duty --

-- when suddenly they hear the sound of HOOVES approaching -- as a SOLDIER ON HORSEBACK exits the front gate on patrol, heading their way -- !

Panicked, THEY DASH ACROSS THE EXPANSE, heading for an OUTCROPPING OF LARGE ROCKS a hundred feet from the wall --

BEHIND THE ROCKS

The group quickly climbs up, ducking for cover. Rocket and Maurice urgently confer, peeking out from behind the rocks at the camp in the distance:

MAURICE
[How will we get in?	Humans everywhere.]

ROCKET
(undeterred)

[Must get in somehow...]
 



(CONTINUED)
 
74.

CONTINUED:

On pins and needles, Bad Ape watches them raptly, trying to interpret their sign language; he sees the repeated two-finger-pointing sign for “get in”, and the implication worries him -- he anxiously taps Maurice on the shoulder --

As Maurice turns, Bad Ape tentatively MIMICS THE “GET IN” SIGN, pointing with his two fingers at the camp:

BAD APE
“In”...?	“In”?

Maurice NODS.	Bad Ape is immediately alarmed:

BAD APE (CONT’D)
No -- no go in -- !

But they ignore him -- Bad Ape persists with panic, shrinking away from them as he pleads:

BAD APE (CONT’D)
Friends! Friends! No go in -- no go iiii--

Without warning he ABRUPTLY DROPS STRAIGHT OUT OF SIGHT, disappearing into the ground as it gives way underneath him!

Everyone turns, shocked to see him gone. They scramble to where he just vanished -- surprised to find him hanging by his fingertips on the lip of a VERY DEEP HOLE!

Rocket reaches down, grasps his forearm, pulling him out --

BAD APE (CONT’D)
(overcome with gratitude)

Thank you, friend -- thank you --

But Rocket ignores him, SEEING SOMETHING in the hole.

Rocket gestures to Maurice, who looks down to DISCOVER...

AN OLD ROPE LADDER staked into one of the dirt sides of the hole, disappearing into the void below.

Maurice and Rocket share an intense look, intrigued...

EXT. PRISON CAMP - YARD - SUNRISE

CLOSE ON CAESAR’S HAND, BOUND TO THE X -- we glimpse the key still grasped in his partially open fingers -- when ARMY WHISTLES shriek through the yard; the fingers stir as we --
 





(CONTINUED)
 
75.

CONTINUED:

REVEAL Caesar rousing from sleep; he looks frail, almost faint -- his treatment and starvation taking its toll. He peers around, sees the apes being CORRALLED from their pens.

He watches as the FIGURE OF THE COLONEL appears at the Warden Tower window; The Colonel looks down at a SOLDIER awaiting his command. The Colonel nods; the Soldier SIGNALS and --

TROOPS step forward with WHEELBARROWS and HEAVY PAILS.

Caesar watches confused as the troops spread among the apes, scooping out HORSE-FEED and setting down PAILS of WATER.

The apes glance at each other, unsure... when one of them nervously HOLDS OUT HIS HANDS --

A Soldier dumps a mound of the dry grain into his palms, and the starving ape immediately SCARFS IT DOWN.

The other starving apes instantly rush forward with CUPPED HANDS -- as others begin to lift pails, DRINKING THIRSTILY.

AT THE PENS, Lake watches amazed.

She looks up AT US, growing emotional, filled with gratitude:

LAKE
[You saved our lives...]

REVERSE ON CAESAR

Stunned. He turns to see Red ascending the platform with a pail of water. Red pauses before Caesar, turning to The Colonel, who watches, motionless. Red turns back, raising the water pail to Caesar’s parched mouth. Still at a loss, Caesar stares at him mistrustfully, but his ravaged body craves sustenance... Finally he parts his lips --

But Red just POURS THE WATER OUT in front of his face, DUMPING IT onto the platform.

Caesar hardens, his bloodshot eyes glaring at Red. He turns to look up at The Colonel, who stands there, still motionless... then steps away, disappearing from view.

CUT TO:

BLACK.

With the SOUND OF DIGGING, a THIN BEAM OF LIGHT streaks out at us through the darkness as STONES TUMBLE FREE; we are --
 




(CONTINUED)
 
76.

CONTINUED:

INT. TUNNEL - DAY

Maurice holds the scavenged flashlight as he and Rocket finish clearing RUBBLE; behind them a length of narrow tunnel recedes. They look around at the area they’ve cleared... to SEE --

SEWAGE TUNNELS leading into darkness. The walls are COVERED IN FADED GRAFFITI. In huge, desperate scrawl they see: “THIS WAY OUT!!!” alongside a spray-painted arrow pointing up.

MAURICE
(turns to Rocket)

[Sick humans must have tried to escape underground!]

Rocket nods and as they start to explore deeper, we CUT TO --

ANOTHER ANGLE FAR BEHIND THEM

We see the two apes and the light from their flashlight start to shrink from view -- REVEAL --

BAD APE

watching from the mouth of the tunnel in the hole they found last night. He gazes anxiously as they disappear -- when --

We hear SHRILL, DISTANT WHISTLES blowing -- Bad Ape turns to see -- THE GIRL CLIMBING the rope ladder toward the sound --

Bad Ape rushes to the ladder, calling up to her, alarmed --

BAD APE
No no no -- no climb -- !

But she continues, climbing out the top... Bad Ape clutches his head, torn about what to do; then reluctantly starts up --

AT THE TOP OF THE HOLE

Bad Ape pokes his head up... to find the Girl heading away --

ON THE GIRL

as she heads toward the edge of the rocks, drawn by something she sees in the distance --

BAD APE (O.S.)
No, no!	Where you go?!
 






(CONTINUED)
 
77.

CONTINUED:

He appears, running after her.. He finds her SQUINTING out at something past the rocks... He follows her stare to ONE OF THE OPENINGS in the massive wall. He whispers to her:

BAD APE (CONT’D)
What?	What you see...?

INT. TUNNEL - DAY

Maurice and Rocket head down the tunnel --

ROCKET
[Must be under the camp by now!]

They stop in a cavernous concrete hub where the sewage tunnels converge --

MAURICE
[Wonder how close we are... to where soldiers keep apes?]

He lifts his flashlight to the ceiling; they both look up --

CUT TO:

A LOW ANGLE SHOT ALONG THE PRISON TRAIN TRACKS - DAY

Apes work on the wall in the distance, some HOISTING heavy BM-12 ROCKET LAUNCHERS into place above -- when -- we HEAR a QUIET RUSTLING sound -- which continues as we PULL FOCUS to the train rail in front of us, and begin PUSHING TOWARD IT...

As we clear over the rail, we TIP DOWN to see the BALLAST GRAVEL under the tracks STARTING TO MOVE... The stones SHUDDER, and suddenly begin to FUNNEL DOWNWARD as we CUT TO --

THE TUNNEL BELOW

where a RUSH OF GRAVEL showers over Rocket, who stands on Maurice’s back as Rocket claws through the earth above them.

DAYLIGHT suddenly peeks in through a TINY HOLE in the surface. Rocket stops digging; he glances down at Maurice, then carefully presses his eye to the hole...

ROCKET’S POV UP THROUGH HOLE

Peering up through the train tracks we can see A TALL METAL POLE looming against the winter sky. As we --
 
78.



CUT WIDE TO THE CAMP ABOVE

The pole is revealed to be a TRAIN SIGNAL SWITCH rising in an exposed area of the yard, Soldiers nearby on either side.

CUT TO:

CAESAR - SEEN THROUGH BINOCULARS - DUSK

He is covered in frost and ice, shivering with hypothermia, very near death...

BAD APE (O.S.)
(quietly distraught)

Ohhhh no, friend...

REVEAL BAD APE - STILL AT THE EDGE OF THE ROCKY OUTCROPPING

lowering the binoculars -- he turns to the girl to share the bad news --

BAD APE (CONT’D)
He --

when he sees

THE GIRL

already starting to walk away toward the camp!

BAD APE
(urgent whisper)

No!

He creeps out from behind the rocks after her -- FRANTICALLY WHISPERING:

BAD APE (CONT’D)
No no no... no no no...

She pauses, peering up for a moment at the immense wall. Then she looks back over her shoulder at Bad Ape -- he WAVES FOR HER TO COME BACK, NODDING desperately...

CUT TO:

CAESAR ON THE X - NIGHT

His head bowed, fading even more now, shaking, his lips cracked, his skin frostbitten and turning blue. He looks as if he might die any second... It is eerily quiet now.
 




(CONTINUED)
 
79.

CONTINUED:

A SHADOW passes over him... And then, a PAIR OF APE HANDS reach slowly into frame, gently cradling Caesar’s face...

CAESAR’S EYES FLUTTER OPEN, struggling to see; he looks up at the Ape, its face OUT OF FOCUS, haloed by the camp’s lights.

As the Ape’s head nears, blocking the light, its face comes into view: it is KOBA, staring down at Caesar tenderly. Caesar’s eyes widen, bewildered; he’s breathless:

CAESAR
Koba...

Koba leans in toward Caesar, gazing into his eyes... then moves even closer, pressing his lips to Caesar’s ear:

KOBA
(a comforting whisper)

Sleep...

Fighting exhaustion, Caesar pulls back, struggling to resist.

KOBA (CONT’D)
Let go...
(glances toward the apes)
You cannot save them...	They will all

die here...

Caesar follows his gaze, then looks back at Koba, stricken:

CAESAR
No...

KOBA (O.S.)
Yes...	Join me...

Caesar starts to shut his eyes, devastated -- when a BLINDING FLASH startles him -- he squints back up as a MACHETE swings through the air overhead -- the blade HACKS into the rope binding his wrist with a LOUD THWACK!

Completely disoriented, Caesar looks back at the Ape beside him again, realizing now it is RED. He looks past him to see The Colonel and Preacher too -- as Red cuts the rope around his other hand, Caesar finally COLLAPSES.

THE COLONEL
If he’s still alive in the morning, he goes back to work or you shoot him.
(then)
Keep him separate from the others.
 




(CONTINUED)
 
80.

CONTINUED: (2)

Preacher nods; as Caesar sees Red moving for him, he uses his last bit of strength to close his fist around the key...

EXT. ROCK-OUTCROPPING - TOP OF THE HOLE - NIGHT

Rocket and Maurice clamber urgently out behind Bad Ape, who stops at the edge of the rocks -- pointing frantically with two fingers again and again at the opening in the barrier wall -- trying to sign:

BAD APE
IN!	She go IN!

Stunned, Maurice and Rocket slowly turn to the camp; and we --

CUT TO:

HIGH ANGLE OVER THE WALL

As Soldiers work busily in the towers and all along the wall securing artillery -- we see the Girl walking right through the open front gate directly below, totally unnoticed...

EXT. CAESAR’S SMALL CAGE - UNDER A GUARD TOWER - NIGHT

PUSHING SLOWLY IN on Caesar through the bars...

He lies on his stomach, face to the ground. As the CAMERA stops, a small blurry FORM steps to the edge of frame...

REVEAL THE GIRL

Standing in front of the cage, staring down at Caesar sadly. After a moment, she fishes into the pocket of her bulky parka, and pulls out her RAG DOLL. She stretches her arm through the bars, straining toward Caesar... GENTLY TOSSING the doll toward him.

Dazed, Caesar slowly lifts his head, confused... and discovers the doll next to him on the ground.

He looks up... to see the Girl staring down with concern.

She holds his gaze; then lifts her tiny hand and tentatively slides her finger along her neck -- the sign Maurice was trying to teach her for:

THE GIRL
[Thirsty...?]

Caesar looks at her, stunned.	And touched.	And then --
 




(CONTINUED)
 
81.

CONTINUED:

The Girl abruptly turns and walks off. Caesar cranes his head, worried for her... unable to see where she’s gone...

when she suddenly returns, lugging a pail of water in both hands. She raises the pail, holds it to the bars.

Caesar lifts himself, pressing his face to the bars... and she tilts the pail, gently spilling water into his mouth. As Caesar thirstily guzzles, the Girl removes one hand from the pail, touching the side of his face --

QUIET APE GRUNTS echo from the yard.	The Girl turns to see --

A LARGE GROUP OF APES pressed to the bars of their pen, watching her and Caesar. A few silently wave her over...

CUT TO:

AN EXTREME WIDE SHOT OF THE YARD

As the Girl crosses from Caesar’s cage to the Apes’ pen, oblivious to the potential danger around her... REVEAL:

MAURICE, ROCKET, AND BAD APE

watching anxiously, their three faces huddled together in the shadows, peering around the edge of the giant front gate...

CUT BACK TO:

CAESAR

gazing nervously through the bars at the Girl, who stands at the Apes’ pen, her back to us; she seems engaged in some transaction with them, the Apes all trying to get near her --

Caesar’s eyes dart tensely around at GUARDS ON PATROL in the distance, unaware of her presence, but for how long...?

Finally, the Girl turns and heads toward Caesar, CRADLING SOMETHING IN HER ARMS. Caesar watches curiously as she steps up to his cage. He glances at the APES IN THEIR PEN to find them all watching expectantly...

Caesar turns back to the Girl; she leans forward carefully, as if about to spill the contents from her arms -- puzzled, Caesar reaches his hands out to catch whatever it is -- AND A LONG STREAM OF GRAIN RUSHES INTO HIS PALMS.

Surprised, Caesar looks up at her... then out at the Apes in the pen, their eyes all still on him. One of them raises his hands, quietly pressing his fists together, SIGNING proudly:
 




(CONTINUED)
 
82.

CONTINUED:

APE
[Apes together strong.]

A wave of emotion floods Caesar’s face; and then he sees other Apes silently raising their fists too... Caesar is completely overcome as each and every one of them joins in.

A smile slowly surfaces on Caesar’s face; you can almost see his strength returning...

The Girl follows Caesar’s gaze to the Apes and their up-stretched hands; then turns back to Caesar. She uncertainly raises her fists together too... smiling, proud of herself.

MAURICE, ROCKET, AND BAD APE

watch from behind the gate, affected by the sight -- when they spot something the apes and the Girl cannot yet see --

THE COLONEL AND SOME OF THE OFFICERS IN THE DISTANCE

deep in conference, walking in the direction of the pens...!

MAURICE AND ROCKET exchange terrified looks --

MAURICE
[If humans see her, they will kill her...]

CUT TO:

ON CAESAR AND THE GIRL

as they SPIN, startled -- suddenly seeing the Colonel and troops stepping into view ten feet away -- when -- a sudden COMMOTION in the distance grabs their attention --

Caesar grunts urgently to the Girl, nodding for her to hide -- she presses quickly behind one of the guard tower legs -- just as the Colonel and troops stop in the path right before Caesar’s cage, still gazing off at the disturbance...

Caesar follows their looks to SEE --

A SQUAD OF FIVE SOLDIERS, guns-drawn, amped up, shouting at AN UNSEEN INTRUDER... As they approach, prodding with their weapons, Caesar discovers the intruder is --

ROCKET.	He marches slowly, chin-raised defiantly.

Caesar watches in shock as Rocket is brought toward the waiting Colonel... who slowly turns and looks suspiciously at Caesar -- unaware of the Girl just behind the tower leg...
 


(CONTINUED)
 
83.

CONTINUED:

As Rocket arrives at gunpoint, the Colonel gestures to Red. Red and Rocket exchange hard stares; Red moves to restrain Rocket’s arms -- but ROCKET SUDDENLY RESISTS, thrashing into Red, HEAD-BUTTING HIM -- Red stumbles, clutching his head, stunned... then LAUNCHES furiously back at Rocket!

The two apes begin VICIOUSLY WRESTLING as the SOLDIERS WATCH, guns trained; a few LAUGH derisively, amused by the display -- TWO TURNCOATS nervously approach, unsure what to do --

Caesar seizes this momentary distraction -- gestures for the Girl to make a run for it -- SHE DARTS AWAY -- ducking behind the long barracks nearby, streaking toward the wall --

The Colonel peers down annoyed at Red and Rocket; he calmly pulls out his sidearm, points down at them and FIRES -- !

Caesar’s head whips around -- as Rocket and Red FREEZE, startled -- a CLOUD OF DIRT kicking up from where the bullet hit the ground beside them...

Red immediately takes the opportunity to get the upper hand, forcing Rocket’s face to the ground, pinning him. The Colonel walks closer to Rocket; stares at him a beat...

THE COLONEL
How many are out there? Are there others?

Rocket stays silent, refusing to show even a hint of fear.

THE COLONEL (CONT’D)
(to Soldiers)
Sweep the area.
(turns to Red)

Put him in the pen.

As the Colonel walks off, Red abruptly leaps to his feet, grabbing Rocket by the ankle -- Rocket FLAILS VIOLENTLY as Red drags him across the dirt and ice...

Caesar watches in horror as the turncoats move in, BEATING ROCKET into submission as they HURL him into the pen. One roughly SHACKLES HIM -- as Red delivers a last, VICIOUS KICK, leaving Rocket in a crumpled heap as they exit.

Caesar’s stricken eyes remain fixed on Rocket as he struggles to his feet. His face bloodied and bruised, Rocket looks back at Caesar through the bars of their pens -- and to Caesar’s surprise, Rocket smiles at him... He SIGNS:

ROCKET
[Feeling better?]
 


(CONTINUED)
 
84.

CONTINUED: (2)

Thrown, Caesar looks at him, then manages a slight smile; he nods. Rocket nods back, pleased:

ROCKET (CONT’D)
[Good.	Then we can talk about escape.]

He brings his fists together: “Apes together strong.” Emotional, Caesar smiles, proud of his friend; as he brings his own fists together...

PRE-LAP -- A LONE HUMAN VOICE SINGING OUT in gospel tones:

EXECUTIVE OFFICER (O.S.)
Hu-uh-left... Left-right-left...

AS WE SLOWLY DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. EPIC WIDE SHOT ABOVE PRISON CAMP - YARD - MORNING

The SOLDIERS MARCH in formation toward the Warden’s Tower...
as the Apes peer anxiously through the bars of their pens...

The procession comes to a halt, all eyes lifting expectantly to the Colonel’s balcony, waiting for him to appear... when the SOUND OF A METAL DOOR suddenly scrapes open -- everyone turns, surprised to see --

THE COLONEL emerging at the base of the tower, right before them. He’s in FORMAL DRESS GREENS, MEDALS on his chest, BERET on his head. He moves to the top of the steps, looks out, studying their uncertain faces a pregnant moment...

ON CAESAR, observing from his cage -- his eyes flit warily to Rocket’s across the way -- then back to the Colonel... as he finally begins to address his assembled troops; there is something momentous, almost reflective in his tone:

THE COLONEL
For two years we’ve fought relentlessly against these beasts, and when we are done with them, we will bring an end to their kind. But now we find ourselves on the eve of battle... against our own kind. So you may ask: who is the real enemy, who are we fighting here? And I’ll tell you. It’s not the apes. It’s not the men who are on their way here right now to altercate with us. The battle we’ve been waging all this time is against ourselves.
 





(CONTINUED)
 
85.

CONTINUED:

He watches them as the words sink in, then starts down the steps, walking among them as he continues -- his eyes dart momentarily across the yard, meeting Caesar’s:

THE COLONEL (CONT’D)
They say we are inhumane. Indecent. They call us a death squad. But they’ll never understand the extent of our sacrifice. How agonizing it has been to do what must be done, even as it tears at our very souls. Because there are times when you must abandon your humanity in the fight to save humanity. All of you have shown the courage to do that... But now we must take that fight to them, or this hellish trial will all have been in vain.
(beat, still walking through
the ranks)
We can not fail. We’re the last defense. Somewhere in this world there are more survivors. And whether they know it or not, they are counting on us. To show the will to protect them against this new plague. We’ve seen it here. And it’s already spreading up north. If we lose this battle, there’ll be nothing to stop it from spreading everywhere. If we lose, in a matter of months, the human race will gasp its last words, and go silent. Just another dumb animal, left to roam a godforsaken world.

He comes to a stop in the Soldier’s midst -- Preacher close by, gazing intently -- the Colonel’s tone growing intimate:

THE COLONEL (CONT’D) Most of you are still young men and women. And if we win, years from now, you may be sitting somewhere with your children, your grandchildren... and they’ll ask you: what did you do in the greatest war...? And you can tell them, you fought... viciously... for a gentler world.

Preacher looks almost emotional -- the others too -- as the
Colonel NODS to the X.O. -- and as WHISTLES SHRIEK -- we:

CUT TO:
 
86.



THE APE PENS - MOMENTS LATER

CRANE over the apes being forced out into the yard... FINDING the Colonel now wading through the chaos, Preacher and Red at his side... as they ARRIVE at CAESAR’S CAGE.

The Colonel pulls out his sidearm, nods to Preacher who unlocks the cage, opens the door... they all stare in at --

CAESAR, who returns a hard, weary look, making no motion to exit -- when CH-CHINK -- the Colonel cocks his gun.

Caesar hesitates, then gathers the strength to stand, and slowly steps out of the cage. The Colonel stares at him, hard:

THE COLONEL
Send him up to the quarry.	Alone.

Red fastens shackles to Caesar’s ankles and wrists, and looks at Preacher, who is searching through his key rings -- he can’t find the shackle key; suddenly nervous, his eyes dart to the Colonel, as he continues searching in vain...

Impatient, the Colonel calls out to Boyle who’s passing by with the first groups of chained apes --

THE COLONEL (CONT’D)
Boyle!	His cuffs.

Boyle heads over, starts to lock Caesar up -- when the Colonel suddenly sees something... Caesar watches as the Colonel steps toward the cage, reaches in... and retrieves... THE GIRL’S DOLL. He stares at it, perplexed:

THE COLONEL (CONT’D)
(turning to Caesar)

What is this...?

But Caesar is silent.	The Colonel turns to Preacher --

THE COLONEL (CONT’D)
How did this get in there?

Preacher shakes his head, looking pale:

PREACHER
I really don’t know, sir...

The Colonel looks back hard at Caesar; then, finally:

THE COLONEL
Get him to work.
 


(CONTINUED)
 
87.

CONTINUED:

The Colonel’s stare lingers on Caesar as Red shoves him forward; then the Colonel returns his attention to --

THE RAG DOLL IN HIS HANDS... looking eerily up at him...

EXT. PRISON CAMP - HIGH UP ON THE ROCK QUARRY SHELF - DAY

Caesar labors alone on a dangerously narrow perch, quarrying for heavy stones high above the yard... He looks down as he works, secretly scanning the yard, to FIND --

ROCKET

waiting to be brought out of the pen, chained to a group of other apes; he glances surreptitiously up at Caesar -- Rocket NODS -- as Rocket’s group is ordered out --

CAESAR WATCHES for a moment as Rocket’s group heads toward the wall -- then he turns quickly to FIND --

LAKE

also looking up at Caesar, waiting with her group by the CHILDREN’S PEN, picking up tools -- she NODS -- and suddenly her group moves out toward the wall too --

CAESAR

turns quickly back to Rocket, whose eyes are fixed on his own feet, COUNTING EACH STEP as his group approaches...

...THE TRAIN SIGNAL SWITCH in the middle of the yard -- the spot where he and Maurice dug up from the tunnel below... As he passes it, Rocket looks up at Caesar -- stealthily signs:

ROCKET
[37.]

Caesar NODS. Then quickly turns back to Lake -- as she too passes the train switch -- she looks up from her feet -- signs to Caesar:

LAKE
[55.]

Caesar NODS -- and immediately begins to climb, pulling himself up to a ledge above -- when -- PING!-PING! -- BULLETS kick off the stones around him! He freezes, looks down at --

SOLDIERS standing guard ATOP THE FUEL TANKER RAILCARS -- one of them lowers his rifle, yells out to Caesar --
 




(CONTINUED)
 
88.

CONTINUED:

TANKER GUARD
That’s high enough, kong!

Caesar submissively holds up his hands. The soldiers eye him a beat longer as Caesar returns to quarrying... then, coast clear, Caesar peers out at --

The ROCK OUTCROPPING in the distance, outside the camp; he can just make out a DARK FORM behind the boulders -- CUT TO:

HANDHELD BINOCULAR POV OF CAESAR ON THE QUARRY LEDGE

Caesar looking right at us, signing:

CAESAR
[37 steps to the adult cage... 55 to the children.]

REVEAL MAURICE

lowering the binoculars; he ducks down behind the rocks -- -- where the Girl and Bad Ape await his command.

Maurice points to the Girl, then up at his eyes, looking around -- as if to say, “You, keep a look out.” The Girl nods back very seriously, his little soldier.

CUT TO:

THE DUSTY COMPASS

from the airstream trailer. The NEEDLE QUIVERS as the compass sits in a massive ape palm -- we are:

INT. TUNNEL - AT THE CONCRETE-FILLED IMPASSE - DAY

Maurice stares at the compass in his hand as Bad Ape watches, holding the flashlight... finally, Maurice lifts his head, and POINTS TO TWO DIFFERENT SPOTS ALONG THE TUNNEL WALL.

Bad Ape nods eagerly, moves to one of the spots, and STARTS TO DIG tentatively, looking to Maurice for approval; Maurice nods, goes to the other spot, STARTS DIGGING as well.

EXT. HIGH OVER THE CAMP - NIGHT

At gunpoint, apes roll MASSIVE SOPHISTICATED ARTILLERY out of the depot at the base of the mountain, and along the train tracks toward the barrier wall...
 
89.



AT THE BARRIER WALL

A cluster of POWERFUL GORILLAS struggle to hoist an imposing high-tech RAPIER MISSILE LAUNCHER up to the top of the wall --

REVEAL -- WIDE ON THE NOW COMPLETED WALL -- MORE RAPIER LAUNCHERS BEING POSITIONED BY APES AND SOLDIERS ALL ALONG THE EXPANSE. The display of sheer force is a formidable sight.

ON CAESAR -- WATCHING THE WALL FORTIFICATION

as Red and Preacher march him across the yard amidst masses of weary apes being herded back to the pens; they arrive at --

CAESAR’S CAGE

As Preacher starts to unlock the door, Caesar’s gaze shifts to Red, and then to the ANGRY WELT over Red’s eye where Rocket head-butted him; Red glowers, self-conscious.

Preacher opens the door, and Red shoves Caesar in. Then Red steps forward to remove the chain leash from Caesar’s neck collar, pressing his face menacingly close to Caesar’s:

RED
You know Kerna shoot apes tomorrow...

when wall is done.

Caesar’s eyes shift briefly to Preacher’s, who looks away.
Then he turns back to Red:

CAESAR
His wall is madness. It won’t save him...

any more than it will save you.

RED
I save myself.

CAESAR
Is there anything left... of you to save?

A brief flash of uncertainty passes over Red as he meets Caesar’s piercing eyes... then he musters a final hard stare at Caesar, and turns to go.

CUT TO:

BINOCULAR POV

as the rest of the apes are prodded off the wall, the intimidating fortification now complete; REVEAL --
 
90.



THE GIRL

Watching from behind the rocks. She lowers the binoculars, blinking out at the camp a beat...

CUT TO:

MOVING WITH THE GIRL THROUGH THE TUNNEL

Eyes wide, she searches for sign of Maurice or Bad Ape... She approaches the cement-filled impasse... finding TWO NEWLY DUG TUNNELS on either side of the blockage. She enters --

ONE OF THE NEW TUNNELS

She heads toward the distant glow of a flashlight up ahead...
Arriving behind Maurice, covered in dirt, still digging away.

He stops, noticing her. He looks at her quizzically -- points upward, makes a tentative thumbs up sign -- “everything ok up there?” She nods. He smiles:

MAURICE
[You are very brave.]

She looks at him, confused.	He gently repeats the sign:

MAURICE (CONT’D)
[Brave.]

She hesitates, then slowly mimics him:

THE GIRL
[...Brave?]

Maurice nods, proud; the Girl smiles, then signs uncertainly:

THE GIRL (CONT’D)
[Ape?]

Maurice doesn’t understand -- she signs again:

THE GIRL (CONT’D)
[Me...?	Ape?]

Maurice gets it now; stares back, struggling for an answer:

MAURICE
[You are...]

Then he notices something. He leans forward and reaches out, gently lifting the Chevy NOVA emblem poking out of her jacket pocket. He shows it to her, smiling warmly as he SPEAKS:
 


(CONTINUED)
 
91.

CONTINUED:

MAURICE (CONT’D)
(pointing at her)

Nova.

The Girl (now NOVA) takes the emblem back, staring at it as it glints in her hand; she looks up at Maurice, pleased with her name -- when A GRUNT comes from behind; they turn -- BAD APE stands excitedly at the mouth of their tunnel.
