BAD APE
Come!	Come see!

As Maurice and Nova move to join him... we LINGER a beat, PUSHING IN on the spot where Maurice was just digging... a TINY RIVULET OF WATER begins seeping through the dirt...

CUT TO:

THE OTHER NEWLY-DUG TUNNEL

Bad Ape leads them forward as he WHISPERS, watching his feet:

BAD APE
...35 ...36 ...37.

He stops and proudly turns, holding out his hands: ta-da!

Nova smiles mutely back at Bad Ape as Maurice looks up from his compass, nods approvingly.

BAD APE (CONT’D)
(whispers, excited)

What now?

Maurice surveys the new tunnel, looking up at the ceiling... then gets down on his hands and knees. He looks up at Bad Ape, and pats his own back, gesturing for Bad Ape to climb on. Bad Ape doesn’t get it:

BAD APE (CONT’D)
What.

Maurice points up at the ceiling, then pats his own back again -- and now it dawns on Bad Ape:

BAD APE (CONT’D)
Ohhh no.	No no no...
(looks to Nova)

Noooo--

Shaking his head, Bad Ape starts to back away -- when Maurice suddenly GRABS his ankle; Bad Ape goes silent, startled.
 



(CONTINUED)
 
92.

CONTINUED:

Maurice lets out a low, surprisingly MENACING GROWL... Bad Ape takes a deep breath; then:

BAD APE (CONT’D)
Ok.

EXT. CAMP - HIGH AND WIDE OVER THE APE PEN - NIGHT

The chained apes are being herded in. A SOLDIER stands inside the pen door, ushering them through, waving his rifle.

CLOSE ON ONE OF THE SOLDIER’S BOOTS pressed into the ice and dirt... when suddenly the TIPS OF APE FINGERS poke up from a tiny hole in the ground below, inches from the man’s toes...

Oblivious to the presence of the boot, the fingers continue to widen the hole, clawing away at the earth... WE CUT --

UNDERGROUND

where Bad Ape stands with his hands above his head, his fingers reaching out through the hole. He stops digging for a moment, straining his neck to look up --

THROUGH THE HOLE

horrified to discover the Soldier’s boot in front of his face! Bad Ape shrinks back -- when one of the apes amassing above NOTICES him, staring down into the hole, perplexed.

Petrified, Bad Ape holds a finger to his lips --

The ape above suddenly gets it; he nods and holds out a hand, inconspicuously signalling Bad Ape to hang tight -- becoming a look-out... as nearby apes start to notice Bad Ape too...

REVEAL MAURICE

Bad Ape’s feet shifting nervously on his shoulders; Maurice looks up uneasily, wondering what’s taking so long...

BACK TO BAD APE

Eyes glued on the look-out ape, who still has his hand raised, watching some unseen activity above... Finally, he turns to Bad Ape again, NODS THE OK --

Bad Ape ventures up, PEERING anxiously through the hole to see THE SOLDIER’S BOOTS walking away, LEAVING THE PEN. Once the Soldier’s gone, he relaxes a bit, turning to see --
 





(CONTINUED)
 
93.

CONTINUED:

APES GATHERED ALL AROUND HIM

staring down into the hole with amazement... at the odd, dirt-coated ape in his toque -- a total stranger to them.

Bad Ape smiles up at the crowd sheepishly -- when another ape roughly presses his way through to the edge of the hole --

IT’S ROCKET.	He stares down at Bad Ape, expressionless...
and then a big smile spreads across his face. He turns excitedly to the look-out ape:

ROCKET
[This is the ape I told you about.]

They all stare at him again, fascinated. The look-out steps forward, and SIGNS to Bad Ape:

LOOK-OUT
[Thank you.]

But Bad Ape looks up insecurely, not understanding the sign; seeing this, the look-out slowly reaches down into the hole, OFFERING HIS HAND.

Bad Ape regards the hand uncertainly... then CLASPS it, beaming. He stares up at his new friend, then pats his chest with his other hand, bowing his head as he nods, quietly fumbling for a way to introduce himself:

BAD APE
...Bad Ape.
(shaking other apes’ hands)

Bad Ape...	Bad Ape...

More and more apes jostle to get a look, greeting him warmly, Bad Ape overcome by the affection from this new family.

DOWN BELOW

Maurice peers up at Bad Ape above him, trying to get a look at what’s going on -- when -- Nova tugs on his fur. He looks at her, and she points --

DOWN THE TUNNEL

where a SMALL STREAM OF WATER is creeping toward them.

Maurice looks at the ground beneath him as the water starts to pool around his feet; alarmed, he instinctively steps forward to investigate -- forgetting Bad Ape on his shoulders. Bad Ape tumbles to the wet floor, surprised.
 



(CONTINUED)
 
94.

CONTINUED:

Maurice spins, realizing; Bad Ape looks at the water around him, confused. As Maurice bends to help him, Bad Ape glances up, seeing something above -- Maurice follows his gaze to --

ROCKET peering over the edge of the hole with concern. His eyes lock on Maurice’s, immediately sensing trouble --

ROCKET
[What’s wrong?]

CUT TO:

EXT. CAESAR’S CAGE - NIGHT

Caesar waits alone, staring tensely at the apes across the way, all huddled around the hole, backs to us. Rocket suddenly breaks through the crowd to report to Caesar, who has been anxiously awaiting news. Rocket looks grave:

ROCKET
[There’s a problem.]

As worry creeps into Caesar’s face, we CUT TO --

INT. TUNNEL - IMMEDIATELY

MUD AND WATER GUSH IN through a WIDENING FISSURE in the wall where Maurice had been digging -- Maurice and Bad Ape try desperately to plug the opening with earth and rocks...

EXT. YARD - THE PENS - NIGHT

We hear QUIET APE GRUNTING -- Caesar stands pressed to the bars of his cage looking across to a large group of apes gathered at the edge of their pen, all eyes fixed on Caesar.

CLOSER ON THE PEN

The apes in mid-debate --

ROCKET
[We can’t dig any further, it will flood the whole tunnel!]

LAKE
[If we don’t dig further, we’ll never get to the children! How are we going to get them out?]

A sudden swell of APE GRUNTS echo the sentiment --

Caesar raises a hand to quiet the apes, peering around at the GUARDS PATROLLING THE CAMP to see if the noise alerted them --
 


(CONTINUED)
 
95.

CONTINUED:

Rocket and some of the others glance up at THE GUARD TOWER directly above Caesar’s cage... where Boyle is leaning suspiciously over the ledge. Boyle listens for a moment -- then, hearing no more commotion, leans back.

The apes all pause warily for a beat; then Lake signs stealthily, worried:

LAKE (CONT’D)
[We have to keep looking down there, see if there’s another way to reach the children...]

But Caesar shakes his head, gravely serious:

CAESAR
[We must leave tonight!]

Pained, Caesar turns behind him, glances at the children, all asleep in their pen -- he can see little Cornelius sleeping too -- he turns back to the other, decisive:

CAESAR (CONT’D)
[We’ll have to get the children out above ground!]

The apes exchange tense looks; then all look back at Caesar:

ROCKET
[How...?]

EXT. WIDE SHOT OF THE CAMP - LATE NIGHT

The lights in the soldiers’ barracks go out, one by one...

UP BY THE GUARD TOWER OVER THE ADULT APE PEN

Boyle steps slowly out onto the catwalk, quietly drinking from a steaming thermos, staring out into the distance --

WHEN SPLAT! He is SUDDENLY PELTED HARD in the back of his head with a handful of what looks like WET MUD from somewhere below. Stunned, he looks at himself, wiping the disgusting muck off: wtf?! He peers furiously over the railing at the pen below --

BOYLE
Hey -- you animals!

SMASH TO:
 
96.



BOYLE

CHARGING down the tower ladder, heading for the pen! He thrusts his keys into the lock, slides open the door, and enters, shutting it behind him; he raises his gun at the shackled apes who shuffle fearfully out of his way:

BOYLE
Who did that?!

The apes cower, shaking their heads, protesting innocence -- when SPLAT! Another WAD of muck smacks the side of his head!

BOYLE (CONT’D)
SONUVA--!!!

He spins, swinging his rifle -- the chained apes rush out of the way in panic, parting to reveal --

THE CULPRIT. It’s Rocket, who stands his ground as he glares back clutching another fistful of muck... Boyle recognizes him:

BOYLE (CONT’D)
You...

Livid, he raises his gun, about to shoot -- when an ORANGUTAN HAND SEIZES HIS ANKLE from below and YANKS HIM DOWN INTO THE HOLE IN THE GROUND! The Apes all stare at the hole...

And a moment later, BOYLE’S KEYS are TOSSED BACK UP.

Rocket moves forward and snatches them up. He looks down into the hole at Maurice; they share a determined look; then Maurice HANDS HIM UP Boyle’s RIFLE --

INT. CAESAR’S CAGE - SIMULTANEOUS

Caesar urgently feels for something along the wall above the cage door -- until he finds where he’s hidden Preacher’s key.

He bends down and immediately begins unshackling his feet... He gets one free -- when -- he hears FOOTSTEPS... He stops, quickly turns, seeing --

THE FIGURE OF THE COLONEL approaching in the distance.

Caesar straightens, carefully palming the key, eyes on the Colonel heading toward the pens... as Rocket, across the way, slowly hides Boyle’s rifle behind his back...
 





(CONTINUED)
 
97.

CONTINUED:

But as the Colonel arrives, mysteriously he doesn’t even glance at the apes, instead staring off at the finished wall in the distance, lost in thought... He continues right past them... stopping 20 paces away, back to us... He just stands there, motionless, taking the sight in.

Caesar watches the Colonel anxiously -- when -- the Colonel turns. He starts slowly back... heading to Caesar’s cage. As he comes closer, we can see he is still in a fog. Caesar is surprised to see the FLASK grasped absently in his hand.

A strange silent beat. And finally, the Colonel speaks -- his tone is oddly vacant:

THE COLONEL
Least you can take comfort... Your struggle ends... Ours goes on... Nature still has the power to wipe us off this planet at any moment... Killed the dinosaurs with a single meteor.

He eerily studies Caesar’s body... musing to himself:

THE COLONEL (CONT’D)
You apes are so strong...	I wonder...
what kind of world you would have

built... on our graves.

Caesar’s eyes search the Colonel’s, trying to make sense of his demeanor. The Colonel gazes off, as if lost in a dream:

THE COLONEL (CONT’D)
You know when I first got to the city... a man said he had to see me. He said he knew you. That you worked together.

Caesar looks surprised.	Beat.	Finally, warily:

CAESAR
...Malcolm?

Caesar’s voice pulls the Colonel out of his reverie for a moment -- he looks at Caesar a bit confused; then, realizing:

THE COLONEL
I think that was his name, yes.

CAESAR
He... was a friend.

THE COLONEL
He said you were remarkable. More than just an animal...

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)
 
98.

CONTINUED: (2)

THE COLONEL (CONT'D)
you were a great leader. I thought he was crazy... But I almost see what he meant.
(he drifts off again)

He pleaded with me to find you. To make peace with you.

Caesar is rapt, stunned by these revelations... But the Colonel is wholly unaware of Caesar’s reaction, staring off in a long unnerving silence. Caesar hesitates, then:

CAESAR
What... happened to this man?

The Colonel remains staring off a moment longer, then finally looks at Caesar... and then off again:

THE COLONEL
I shot him.

He remains still a moment longer -- then suddenly looks around, disoriented, as if awakened from a dream --

THE COLONEL (CONT’D)
(quietly paranoid)

What’s going on here?

Caesar frowns at him, disquieted and perplexed... The Colonel’s eyes dart suspiciously around him; he cranes his neck to peer up through the falling snow at the guard tower, but the angle is too steep to see if anyone is up there --

A CLANK at his feet makes him look down... where he finds he’s dropped his flask. He picks it up, looks at it as if having no memory of even bringing it out here.

Suddenly self-conscious, he looks around at the apes in their pen, all staring back at him -- and then at Caesar. He slowly backs away, then turns, retreating through the darkness to his tower.

Caesar watches him go, then turns to find Rocket and the other apes looking at him, confused.

ROCKET
[...What was that?]

Caesar shakes his head, just as confused. Then returns to action, bending down to unshackle his other ankle -- he unlocks it -- then TOSSES PREACHER’S KEY TO --

ROCKET, who reaches through the pen bars and catches them mid-air; he quickly unshackles himself, TOSSES THE KEY to --
 


(CONTINUED)
 
99.

CONTINUED: (3)

LAKE, who immediately starts to unshackle herself -- she passes the keys down the line of her chain gang, they all begin to unshackle themselves too --

ROCKET moves to the pen door, uses BOYLE’S KEYS to unlock it -- then tosses BOYLE’S KEYS across to --

CAESAR, who starts to unlock his cage -- when he notices something -- he holds up his hand! Everyone freezes. They all look up at --

THE WARDEN’S TOWER

to see the Colonel stepping toward his lighted window, his face in SILHOUETTE -- he might be staring down at them, or off into the distance, it’s impossible to tell...

Caesar and Rocket share a tense look --

ROCKET
[Do you think he knows we’re up to something?]

Unsure, Caesar peers back up at the Colonel’s silhouette. After a beat, the Colonel steps away from the window. Rocket looks anxiously at Caesar, raising the rifle:

ROCKET (CONT’D)
[Now?]

CAESAR
(shakes his head)

[Wait till he turns out his lights.]

HOLD as	they stare	at	the lighted window, waiting...	as we --	
waiting...	SOUNDS	OF	FIERCELY GUSTING WIND rising...		

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. YARD - WIDE ON THE TOWER AND PENS - LATER

IT’S SNOWING HARD NOW, a fresh layer blanketing everything. And still, the Colonel’s lights remain on. The apes are all pressed to the bars of their pen, eyes fixed up on the Colonel’s window; some pace, tortured by the wait...

PUSHING IN ON CAESAR

Staring up with coiled intensity, totally still... His gaze shifts to Rocket, whose eyes are locked on Caesar --

ROCKET
[The sun will be up soon...]
 


(CONTINUED)
 
100.

CONTINUED:

Torn, Caesar steals a final look at the lighted window...
then turns back to Rocket -- forced to make the call:

CAESAR
[We go now.	Or die trying.]

Rocket nods -- he waits as the SEARCHLIGHT PASSES, then darts out of the pen, holding the stolen rifle -- crossing to Caesar’s cage, as Caesar steps out -- they both streak --

TOWARD THE SOLDIERS’ BARRACKS

ducking into an alley between the building and the children’s pen -- they press against the barrack’s wall, peering down the alley to see --

SOLDIERS PASSING BY THE CHILDREN’S PEN

Caesar waits until the Soldiers cross out of sight -- then looks to Rocket, and they head for --

THE CHILDREN’S PEN

A small cluster of kids rush to the door as Caesar unlocks it; others stir from their sleep, scrambling over to see --

Caesar and Rocket enter. The little apes swarm around them, wide-eyed. Caesar gently pats their heads, shushing them -- when suddenly he sees HIS SON in the crowd. Cornelius breaks into a run, clambering up over the backs of the others...

straight into Caesar’s arms. Emotion floods Caesar’s face as he tightly embraces his son...

CAESAR
(overcome, holding him
tight)

I love you, son...

CUT TO:

A POV THROUGH A DOORWAY AT A GUARD TOWER

We glimpse the side of the Guard’s head as he stares down, eating --

REVEAL ROCKET, keeping lookout on the guard from the doorway; behind him the children are huddled with Caesar -- Caesar hustles the children toward a LIGHT POLE, quickly hoisting one after another up onto it --

CUT WIDER OVER THE CHILDREN’S PEN
 




(CONTINUED)
 
101.

CONTINUED:

where we see Caesar, Rocket and the children are on a second story landing, dangerously close to the Guard Tower -- the little apes scale the tall light pole, scrambling out onto --

THE ELECTRICAL LINE

suspended high over the Guard Towers and camp --

As SNOW SWIRLS HARD all around them, the children make their way back toward the adult pen -- directly over the heads of the unwitting Soldiers below!

IN THE ADULT PEN

The children arrive on the wire above and begin dropping down silently, one by one -- into the waiting arms of Lake and other unchained apes -- the apes urgently hand the kids off to their anxious parents.

As the emotional reunions continue, Caesar (Cornelius clinging around his neck) and Rocket finally arrive overhead too, each dropping down into the grasp of the massive gorillas waiting below.

CUT TO:

MAURICE

Staring up urgently from the hole in the adult pen... as Caesar and the apes converge above; Caesar and Rocket begin HANDING THE CHILDREN DOWN...

IN THE HOLE

Maurice lowers the kids to the tunnel floor; they look up to find Nova extending her hand... and they start off after her down the tunnel...

EXT. ROCK-OUTCROPPING OUTSIDE CAMP - TOP OF HOLE - PRE-DAWN

Bad Ape clutches himself, shivering nervously in the wind -- when he hears a NOISE FROM BELOW; he looks down to see --

Nova leading the apes out of the tunnel, and pointing them up the ladder toward Bad Ape; he smiles sweetly, reaching down to the frightened children as he WHISPERS:

BAD APE
It’s ok, little ones... come, come.

CUT TO:
 
102.



THE EDGE OF THE OUTCROPPING

Bad Ape pokes his head around a boulder, peeking up through his BINOCULARS at --

A GUARD POST ALONG THE BARRIER WALL

where Soldiers pace, scanning the distant, dark horizon...

BAD APE turns behind him, where Maurice and Nova are now huddled with all the ape children -- Bad Ape gestures as he WHISPERS:

BAD APE
Go!	Go go go...!

Nova climbs onto Maurice’s back, and they rush off, leading the little apes SINGLE FILE from behind the rocks, dashing out across an EXPOSED STRETCH OF FLATS under the cover of darkness -- and heading up into the mountain on the side of the camp...

CUT TO:

BACK IN THE ADULT PEN

Caesar slowly moves toward the fence, staring out at something tensely, as behind him Rocket urgently ushers apes down into the hole. As the last of the apes descend, Rocket turns to see Caesar is staring up at the Warden’s Tower. Rocket moves to Caesar, urgent --

ROCKET
[Hurry!	Let’s go!]

But Caesar stays motionless, eyes fixed intently on the Colonel’s still lighted window.

ROCKET (CONT’D)
[Caesar, what’s wrong?]

Caesar stares darkly at the tower, preoccupied:

CAESAR
By the time the sun rises, you’ll all be on your way... to a new home.
(finally, he turns)

Hurry, you must go.

And now it hits Rocket, Caesar is not coming with him --

ROCKET
[Without you?	No...]
 


(CONTINUED)
 
103.

CONTINUED:

Caesar sees the pain in Rocket’s face, and it pains him too; but something still burns inside him:

CAESAR
Maurice was right. I am like Koba. He could not escape his hate...
(his eyes fix on the tower
again)

And I still cannot escape mine. He took too much from me.

After a long moment, he turns back to Rocket; Rocket nods, his eyes now unexpectedly emotional. Caesar puts a hand around Rocket’s head, pulls his forehead against his -- a final embrace. He pulls back, says softly:

CAESAR (CONT’D)
Go...

Rocket looks at him, then reluctantly starts for the hole.
He takes one last look at Caesar, and begins to descend.

CUT TO:

BAD APE

excitedly waving on the children, sending them off toward the mountain -- when an OMINOUS RUMBLING begins, shaking the ground. Alarmed, Bad Ape looks quickly up at --

THE GUARD POST ALONG THE BARRIER WALL

where Soldiers react to the sound, startled -- anxiously scanning the horizon -- suddenly SEEING something in the distance -- as --

BAD APE

TURNS to the horizon too, lifts his binoculars --

BAD APE’S BINOCULAR POV

Through snowy haze, we can make out the cock-eyed headlights of A HUGE ARMADA OF MILITARY VEHICLES APPROACHING INEXORABLY

--	their hulking shapes advancing across the frozen tundra. As ALARMS SOUND all along the wall --

CUT TO:
 
104.



EXT. YARD - THE BARRACKS - CONTINUOUS

LIGHTS blink on in the windows as waking SOLDIERS flood into the yard with weapons -- we PAN WITH THEM as they RUSH for the wall, SHOUTING --

SOLDIER
Holy shit -- they’re here!!!

As they race by, the CAMERA FINDS CAESAR, hidden, crouched beside the building, watching them go, taking this news in... He waits until the Soldiers pass, then BOLTS UP ONTO --

THE BARRACKS ROOF

We MOVE WITH CAESAR -- as he races along the edge, below him we see the tide of Soldiers storming in the opposite direction... Finally, Caesar STOPS --

BENEATH THE WARDEN’S TOWER

He hears FRANTIC BANGING below.	He peers down to see --

A GROUP OF OFFICERS POUNDING on the STEEL DOOR of the tower --

EXECUTIVE OFFICER (O.S.)
COLONEL!	COLONEL!!!
(turns to one of the men)

OPEN THE GODDAMN DOOR, SOLDIER!

SOLDIER (O.S.)
I CAN’T!	IT’S BLOCKED FROM INSIDE, SIR!

EXECUTIVE OFFICER (O.S.)
WHERE THE HELL IS HE?!

SOLDIER (O.S.)
I DON’T KNOW, SIR!	WE HAVEN’T SEEN THE
COLONEL ALL NIGHT!

Caesar ducks back, quickly stares up at the tower overhead -- SPOTS the Colonel’s OPEN WINDOW four stories above... He takes a last look around -- then LEAPS across from the barracks’ roof to the side of the tower...

EXT. YARD - PRE-DAWN

More Soldiers rush past -- when one SLOWS, looking RIGHT AT US in utter shock. It’s Preacher:

PREACHER
Jesus Christ...
 



(CONTINUED)
 
105.

CONTINUED:

PAN with him as he steps right past the camera to REVEAL --

THE EMPTY APE PENS; he SPINS BACK to us, SHOUTING:

PREACHER (CONT’D)
THE APES!!!	THEY’RE GONE!!!

INT. WARDEN’S TOWER - CONTROL ROOM - PRE-DAWN

Caesar silently climbs in the window; he looks around... and immediately spots an unnerving, incongruous sight --

THE FRONT DOOR is BARRICADED WITH FURNITURE from the inside.

Confused, Caesar looks around, sees the area in total disarray: a SMALL STOCKPILE OF MUNITIONS lie scattered chaotically across a table, alongside a tray of HALF-EATEN FOOD and the Colonel’s SPILLED FLASK...

Soaked in liquid from the flask is a PHOTO OF A LITTLE BOY; beside it OLD WAR MEDALS; Caesar peers around, wary: where’s the Colonel...?

EXTREME WIDE SHOT - IN FRONT OF THE CAMP

A SERIES OF INTENSELY BRIGHT RAPIER MISSILES rip into the sky from atop the barrier wall, SOARING HIGH ABOVE THE ROCKY OUTCROPPING, illuminating the landscape below --

TOP OF THE HOLE

Bad Ape shudders, watching the missiles -- as they EXPLODE into the path of the armada -- TWO OF THE FRONT VEHICLES ERUPT!

Panicked, he frantically urges the children --

BAD APE
Hurry!	Go go go!

When A SUDDEN ROAR AND BLINDING FLASH makes him turn to see --

ARTILLERY SHELLS SOARING in return from the giant vehicles --

Bad Ape LUNGES protectively over nearby children -- when --

BOOOOMM!!!	The SHELLS MAKE IMPACT 30 feet from the wall!

DEBRIS HAILS DOWN on our group as they hug the ground!

SMASH TO:
 
106.



THE TUNNELS BELOW -- CROWDED WITH ESCAPING APES

They stop, look around in fear as the space RUMBLES VIOLENTLY around them -- alarmed, ROCKET begins pushing his way through the crush to get to the other end, gripping his rifle --

ROCKET
[Let me through!]

SMASH TO:

CAESAR IN THE WARDEN’S TOWER

He whips his head at the sound of continued shelling -- panicked, he rushes to the window to see INCOMING MISSILES FROM THE ARMADA beginning to make IMPACT INSIDE THE YARD -- !

When a QUIET CRASH comes from somewhere close behind him. Caesar turns, startled, gaze fixing apprehensively on a PARTIALLY OPENED DOORWAY; he steels himself, and slowly approaches the door.

He hesitates, wary... then carefully peers around the door frame, glimpsing a BROKEN COLEMAN LAMP at the foot of a small table; kerosine still pools from the lamp’s base.

Beyond the door, Caesar suddenly hears labored breathing...
He pushes it open to REVEAL...

THE COLONEL’S SLEEPING QUARTERS - PRE-DAWN/INTO DAWN

The Colonel is splayed on his stomach across a military cot -- head lowered, his outstretched hand trembles mid-air as he struggles in a total daze, like a drunk, grasping helplessly for something out of reach on the table... HIS PISTOL.

Heart racing, Caesar crosses silently to the table... eyes glued to the Colonel, he places his hand firmly on the gun before the Colonel can get to it.

Caesar lifts the gun slowly, then trains it down at the Colonel beneath him, who is so out of it he continues listlessly groping for a gun that isn’t there.

Caesar glares down at the Colonel, pitiless... his expression hardening as he prepares to finish him, once and for all --

--	when the Colonel slowly lifts his head to peer up at Caesar... and for the first time, Caesar sees there is BLOOD smeared on his face from under his nose.
 





(CONTINUED)
 
107.

CONTINUED:

The Colonel’s eyes look desperate, like a wounded animal’s; he opens his mouth pleadingly, trying to speak -- but the only sounds that come are eerie, GASPING GRUNTS...

Caesar stares back in utter shock -- when he notices something on the floor near the bed...

It’s Nova’s crude RAG DOLL, silently gazing up at him, now flecked with the Colonel’s blood.

Reeling, Caesar unconsciously lowers the gun -- but as the Colonel reaches lamely for it, Caesar instantly remembers himself, raising the weapon threateningly again at his head --

But the Colonel doesn’t even flinch, the barrel just inches from his face. He begins quietly gasping once more; Caesar watches, unnerved, finger on the trigger, as the Colonel lifts himself, slowly leaning his head forward...

...and pressing his own temple against the muzzle -- he looks up at Caesar, his tortured eyes pleading mutely for death.

HOLD ON CAESAR

as he stares down, haunted... his gaze shifting from the Colonel’s agonized face... to the gun in his hand...

Finally, horrified, he slowly LOWERS THE GUN. Self-awareness returns to his eyes -- a look of humanity we haven’t fully seen since before the death of his family, as if the war within him is finally coming to an end.

The Colonel gapes helplessly... as Caesar, quietly stunned by his own decision, starts to back away... Caesar pauses, pitying eyes on the Colonel’s; then finally, he gently sets the gun back down onto the table.

A look of confused gratitude flickers through the Colonel’s primitive gaze... and he resumes REACHING LAMELY for the gun.

Eyes still on him, Caesar backs slowly out --

INTO THE CONTROL ROOM

We see Caesar, his back to us, as he continues gazing into the Colonel’s sleeping quarters... then, after a quiet, clumsy fumbling sound, a SINGLE GUNSHOT echoes from the room.

Caesar remains still, then lowers his head as day breaks outside...

CUT TO:
 
108.



UP ON THE BARRIER WALL - DAYLIGHT NOW

Through SWIRLING SNOW we see RED and other TURNCOATS arrive at one of the posts, laden with ammo for the troops who hurriedly load their weapons, preparing for the imminent firefight once the rapidly approaching armada arrives. As Red hands bullet belts to a GUNNER loading a big .50 cal machine gun --

Soldiers around them unleash another round of Rapier missiles -- WHOOOOSH -- two more MLRS vehicles EXPLODE on the horizon!

Soldiers around the missile launcher react with raucous cheers to the direct hits, a sense that the battle’s theirs to win --

--	when the GUNNER beside Red suddenly NOTICES THE APES scrambling by the rock out-cropping -- his jaw drops, in complete shock!

GUNNER
(screams to the others)

LOOK!!! THE APES!!!

Red spins with disbelief to see the apes below -- as the Gunner rotates his machine gun -- and OPENS FIRE!!!

EXT. WARDEN’S TOWER - WINDOW - IMMEDIATELY

We see Caesar about to climb out -- when he SEES the apes taking heavy fire from gunners on the wall! He freezes, terror-stricken, grappling for a way to save them -- when his eyes lock on the TANKER CARS just beneath the wall --

He quickly turns from the window, charging back into the control room -- when --

A SUDDEN BANGING comes from the front door --

EXECUTIVE OFFICER (O.S.) Colonel! Are you in there?! Colonel!

Caesar spins, startled -- then finishes grabbing a BANDOLIER OF GRENADES off the table strewn with the Colonel’s belongings -- he bolts for the window -- when --

CRASH! The door SMASHES OPEN -- Caesar turns to see the X.O. AND HIS MEN ENTERING -- they see him too -- raising their weapons, and FIRING AS -- CAESAR LEAPS
 
109.



OUT THROUGH THE WINDOW!!!

HE SWINGS DOWN FROM THE TOWER LEDGE -- and GRASPS onto the FLAGPOLE stretched across the open space beneath -- the pole breaks his fall, but only so much -- as ONE SIDE SNAPS FREE!

Caesar hangs on, riding the swinging pole as it descends -- and finally releasing it, tumbling to the ground!

Caesar scrambles to his feet, still clutching the grenades -- -- when the Officer and his men appear in the tower window!
They OPEN FIRE -- as Caesar sprints away -- bullets tearing up snow and ice right behind him as he goes -- !

CUT TO:

ROCKET - AT THE ROCK OUT-CROPPING

DESPERATELY FIRING Boyle’s automatic rifle, trying to provide cover for the FLEEING APES who are now PINNED BELOW IN CHAOS

--	as BEHIND HIM ON THE ROCKS, Bad Ape and another HORDE OF APES are gathered helplessly around the hole, some apes still crawling out to discover there’s now nowhere to go...

UP ON THE BARRIER WALL

The Gunner ducks from Rocket’s bullets, then jumps back up, returning a mad volley from his machine gun, SHOUTING over the din to the other soldiers firing beside him --

GUNNER
Kill them, man!!!	Kill them all!!!

REVEAL RED behind them, watching the apes under attack -- the SOUND FADES as he gazes, unexpectedly disturbed by the sight -- when A MUFFLED VOICE rises out of the silence --

GUNNER (O.S.) (CONT’D)
...Donkey -- DONKEY!!!

Red SNAPS OUT OF IT, turning to the exasperated Gunner --

GUNNER (CONT’D)
GET THE GRENADE LAUNCHER!!!

Flustered, Red turns, moves to his rucksack, retrieving the launcher -- when he stops suddenly, SEEING --

CAESAR - IN AN EPIC WIDE SHOT OF THE CAMP BELOW
 




(CONTINUED)
 
110.

CONTINUED:

QUADRUPEDING at great speed for the yard, as another incoming mortar hits the ground -- Caesar DARTS HARD around the front of the pen -- and fearlessly straight through the PLUMING DEBRIS and SWIRLING SNOW -- a heroic battlefield image!

Mesmerized, Red watches motionless as Caesar charges fearlessly through the chaos toward the TANKER directly beneath gunners on the wall!

Caesar continues through the smoke and debris -- finally grabbing one of the grenades from the bandolier -- eyes fixed on the tanker just 30 feet away -- rearing back, about to pull the pin -- WHEN SUDDENLY --

CAESAR DROPS, CLUTCHING HIS SIDE -- TUMBLING TO THE GROUND!

Shocked, Red watches as Caesar, in agony, touches his abdomen, discovering BLOOD; Caesar reaches behind him to find he’s been shot in the back with a CROSSBOW ARROW...

Red looks up to see -- PREACHER stalking through the haze and snow, out of the pen area, almost shocked himself at what he has just done -- he nervously loads another arrow, in turmoil as he moves toward Caesar.

Gasping in pain, Caesar SNAPS the arrow from his side, and turns, seeing Preacher too...

Red stands frozen, gripped by the sight of Caesar lying there helpless --

GUNNER (O.S.) (CONT’D)
GODAMMIT!!!

Red turns, startled, to find the Gunner screaming at him, momentarily turned from the battle --

GUNNER (CONT’D)
YOU STUPID DONKEY!!!	WHERE’S MY
LAUNCHER!?!

Red suddenly looks at the weapon in his hands, remembering what he was ordered to do -- still returning to his senses, he nods to the Gunner -- who immediately turns back to the battle, FIRING RELENTLESSLY at the apes...

CUT TO:

CAESAR ON THE GROUND

as he sees Preacher anxiously closing in... Caesar’s eyes frantically dart for an avenue of escape, but there is none.

111.

CONTINUED:

His pained gaze returns to Preacher who comes to a stop just 25 feet away, hesitating, torn -- then, finally steeling himself, he raises the LOADED CROSSBOW -- when --

FSSSSSSST--KABLOOM! Preacher DISAPPEARS in a HUGE BLAST!!! AND EVERYTHING GOES INSTANTLY SILENT, THE SOUND REPLACED BY A QUIET RINGING --

Stunned, disoriented, Caesar looks around him, deafened, finally peering up to discover --

RED ON THE WALL holding the SMOKING LAUNCHER, looking down stoically.

Caesar can’t believe it... He gazes up in shock at --

RED, who just gazes back, calmly holding the weapon, almost in a state of peace -- while BEHIND HIM --

THE GUNNER turns, suddenly realizing what Red has just done, freaking out, his SCREAMING INAUDIBLE to Caesar’s ringing ears -- the Gunner pulls out his PISTOL -- pointing it at Red, who doesn’t even react -- we see just a split-second of his SILENT MUZZLE FLASH -- when we CUT --

CLOSE ON CAESAR

as he takes in the grim sight, pained -- THEN --

THE GUNNER turns and takes aim at CAESAR!

Caesar scrambles, the sounds around him (and us) suddenly starting to return -- as -- he SNATCHES UP THE GRENADE from the ground beside him -- jumping to his feet --

--	narrowly dodging the Gunner’s bullets tearing up earth around him -- as he PULLS THE PIN from the grenade, desperately LAUNCHING it straight for the tanker beneath the wall --

The Gunner’s alarmed eyes suddenly whip toward the tanker -- as Caesar takes off, sprinting in the opposite direction --

-- when the grenade EXPLODES and THE TANKER ERUPTS -- ENGULFING the WALL beside it, and consuming all the Gunners above in its INCREDIBLE BLAST!!!

Caesar races into the adult pen -- as behind him, FLAMES CLIMB HIGH INTO THE SKY -- when SUDDENLY -- THE TRAIN CAR NEXT TO THE TANKER EXPLODES TOO!

Still running, Caesar steals a startled look back -- as ANOTHER CAR EXPLODES!

CONTINUED:

He DIVES down into the hole -- as --

WE CUT WIDE OVER THE CAMP -- AND THE CHAIN REACTION CONTINUES
--	CARS ERUPTING ONE AFTER ANOTHER -- BLASTING THE CAMP APART
--	HEADING BACK ALONG THE TRACKS TOWARD THE DEPOT AT THE BASE OF THE MOUNTAIN -- A CATACLYSMIC DISPLAY OF DESTRUCTION SO LARGE, IT’S STAGGERING!!!

SMASH TO:

CAESAR RUNNING THROUGH THE TUNNELS BELOW

AS THE SHOCKWAVES CONTINUE, THE TUNNELS GIVING WAY, BEGINNING TO COLLAPSE BEHIND HIM!

CAESAR RACES FOR LIGHT AT THE TUNNEL’S END -- LEAPING FOR THE LADDER -- SCRAMBLING UP -- WHEN THE WHOOSH OF DEBRIS SUDDENLY SWEEPS AROUND HIM -- AND HE EMERGES -- TUMBLING OUT --

THROUGH THE HOLE IN THE ROCKY OUTCROPPING

And flat onto his stomach!

Finally, he lifts his head to see the feet of apes all around, their backs to him -- as he rises, he finds them all staring out beyond the outcropping in awe...

He slowly presses his way through the crowd, climbing higher on the rocks... to discover their eyes all fixed on...

THE UTTERLY DECIMATED PRISON, engulfed in a massive conflagration as a STORM OF DEBRIS RAINS DOWN FROM THE SKY...

Now seeing Caesar, Rocket and Bad Ape turn, stunned at the sight of him -- Caesar and Rocket begin to exchange emotional looks --

--	when MECHANICAL GROANS beside them make them all turn to see --

THE REMAINING ARMADA as it finally arrives, braking to a stop just 20 yards away... SOLDIERS, FACES ALL OBSCURED in heavy parkas and BALACLAVAS, are packed onto troop carriers, trucks and humvees, gazing in shock at the fiery camp -- when ONE notices... the apes. Others start to see them too... A moment suspended in time as ape and man all stare silently at each other...

Then, the anonymous soldiers slowly begin to raise their weapons -- Caesar and the apes remaining totally still -- when --
 




(CONTINUED)
 
113.

CONTINUED:

--	FROM THE CAMP -- one more ENORMOUS EXPLOSION ERUPTS as the weapons depot finally BLOWS, TEARING OPEN the face of the mountain; everyone flinches, JOLTED, as a last THUNDEROUS BOOM ECHOES HARD against the canyon walls --

A QUIET RUMBLING starts to resound all around...

The Soldiers all turn, looking up -- Caesar and the apes turn as well -- to see --

AN AVALANCHE OF SNOW AND ROCK AND EARTH GATHERING STEAM IN THE MOUNTAINS ABOVE THEM.

And it’s heading their way --

A HUMAN VOICE CRIES OUT
AVALAAAAAAANCHE...!!!

Mad scrambling begins -- Soldiers leaping from the trucks, futilely running in all directions across the canyon floor --

When Caesar, on instinct, suddenly CRIES OUT TO HIS APES -- WAVING THEM ON FIERCELY -- as he does the unthinkable -- tearing off with simian speed -- TOWARD THE AVALANCHE...!

AND THE APES FOLLOW -- CAESAR LEADING THEM EN MASSE, RACING UP THE MOUNTAIN...!

CUT TO:

HALFWAY UP THE MOUNTAIN - IMMEDIATELY

Maurice, Nova, and the ape children turn abruptly -- staring wide-eyed at the growing TSUNAMI OF SNOW billowing right toward them!

Eyes darting, Maurice fixes on the TALL TREES beside them -- he BELLOWS out to them -- and all at once -- everyone makes a break for them -- climbing up -- just as the AVALANCHE ARRIVES -- !

SMASH TO:

CAESAR AND THE APES RUNNING - FURTHER DOWN THE MOUNTAIN

They LAUNCH themselves up into the trees -- moving higher -- higher --

--	as the AVALANCHE SUDDENLY SURGES below, the WAVE OF SNOW RISING toward them -- as they frantically climb to avoid it!!!
 
114.



SUPER WIDE - ABOVE THE CANYON - IMMEDIATELY

THE MONUMENTAL AVALANCHE CRASHES APOCALYPTICALLY to the canyon floor, THE ROILING SNOW BEGINNING TO ENGULF the

BURNING CAMP, THE SOLDIERS, THE TRUCKS, EVERYTHING IN SIGHT -- SMASH TO:

CAESAR REACHING THE TREE TOP

as the RISING RUSH OF SNOW begins to wash violently over him!

TIGHT ON CAESAR

CLINGING to the trunk, an elemental fight against the RAGING WHITENESS -- holding on for life as snow HOWLS DEAFENINGLY around him, ripping at his body... until finally, as quickly as it began, the tide subsides... suddenly leaving us in --

A STUNNING SILENCE.

Caesar peers around in a daze to find himself in a SURREAL HAZE OF WHITE, as if in a heavenly cloud... And slowly, the mist begins to clear...

Caesar stares down from the tree top to discover an incredible sight below...

EVERYTHING AND EVERYONE ARE GONE, THE ENTIRE CANYON BURIED IN PRISTINE SNOW... It’s as if nothing was ever here.

He stares for a moment in disbelief -- when sounds of apes ECHO through the landscape -- he lifts his head to see --

THE APES, all clinging to the tree tops all around him. They look at him, their savior, the chorus of ape sounds growing louder... more exuberant... triumphant. They raise their fists in solidarity and tribute to Caesar...

A smile begins to spread across Caesar’s face, as he raises a weary fist back to them, we --

SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

A SERIES OF EPIC 65MM SUPER-WIDE LANDSCAPES, DAVID LEAN-STYLE

THE APE EXODUS moving on foot across SNOWY PLAINS...

CLOSER ON CAESAR as he pulls Bad Ape’s blanket tighter around Cornelius and himself, shielding them both from the cold. We HOLD on Caesar’s face, etched with strain, but determination too...
 
115.



through the sands of STUNNING MOJAVE DESERT VISTAS...

...until they reach what looks like a vast, arid wasteland,
passing the outskirts of a DECIMATED NUCLEAR POWER PLANT...

MOVE CLOSER

As Caesar, Cornelius on his shoulder, walks with the others past a huge, rusted SIGN: “FORBIDDEN ZONE.” Caesar looks to Rocket, uncertain... but Rocket points reassuringly ahead... at a DISTANT DESERT VOLCANO. As they continue onward, we --

DISSOLVE AGAIN TO:

THE TOP OF THE DESERT VOLCANO

The mass of apes scaling up, and finally cresting over the lip... Caesar pauses momentarily in shock, and then we PAN with him as he and the others step forward to REVEAL:

A GORGEOUS LUSHLY-OVERGROWN GREEN CRATER, a CRYSTAL BLUE LAKE at its center; a kind of paradise, a place to begin again...

Exhausted, Caesar has to sit for a moment on one of the mossy rocks, taking in the beauty as the apes excitedly pass, exploring the incredible landscape of their new home...

Maurice arrives beside him, Nova on his back; Cornelius peeks curiously over his father’s shoulder, fascinated with her. She smiles shyly, when a bunch of ape children race playfully past, jostling and scurrying. Both turn, watching them go.

Then Nova hops off Maurice, eager to join in the fun. She pauses, turning back to Cornelius, holding out a hand...

Cornelius climbs carefully down, then stops, looking up uncertainly at Caesar, not sure if he’s ready yet to leave his father’s side. Touched, Caesar smiles down at his son; he kneels before him, caressing his face gently, filled with great emotion... then he nods gently for him to go play -- and he and Nova hurry off.

Maurice and Caesar share a look, a pair of proud fathers. They both turn to watch little Cornelius and the other ape children playing with the lone human girl. A strange, joyous sight. Pleased, Maurice turns back to Caesar, discovers him watching with profound emotion on his face -- when to Maurice’s surprise, Caesar LOSES BALANCE for a moment...

Maurice stares with concern as Caesar rights himself, WINCING in pain, avoiding Maurice’s eyes.

CONTINUED:

And then Maurice reaches out, gently pulls the blanket back, which has slipped down Caesar’s shoulder... and for the first time, Maurice sees CAESAR’S HAND, cupped to his side; it is soaked in BLOOD.


Caesar glances up, finds Maurice staring at him, suddenly distraught. A long unspoken look passes between them, Caesar’s sad smile confirming Maurice’s worst fears. The exchange between the old friends is heartbreaking. Finally, Caesar speaks, a sense of contentment in his quiet voice:

CAESAR
Don’t worry...	You are all home now.
Apes are strong.	With... or without me.

Tears well in Maurice’s eyes, as Caesar smiles peacefully --

--	when the playful sounds of ape children suddenly draw him back to the toddlers again. Maurice watches as Caesar’s eyes fix wistfully on his son... a sense of tremendous melancholy setting in, as his breathing grows more labored...

Maurice grunts gently.	Caesar slowly turns back to him, and
Maurice speaks:

MAURICE
(filled with emotion)

Son will know... who was father... and what Caesar... did... for us.

Caesar smiles, tears now in his eyes too. He turns back to his son for a last look... As we CUT CLOSE ON --

HIS ICONIC GREEN EYES

A FINAL SLOW DISSOLVE BEGINS -- TO A WIDE SHOT OVER THE APE PARADISE... for a moment, the eyes and the landscape of apes linger together -- then, as Caesar’s eyes peacefully shut, we FINISH DISSOLVING TO THE WIDE -- and gently TIP UP to the TRANQUIL SKY -- HOLD, as the sounds of apes echo...

CUT TO BLACK.

THE END.
